Their most expensive current player cost just \u00a32.7m. And leading the line they have Roberto Soldado, now 34 and back in Spain after two years in Turkey.\n\nThey are used to being plucky underdogs. They have never finished higher than sixth in Spain's first division, a feat they achieved twice back in 1972 and 1974.\n\nThis is just their seventh season in La Liga since 1976, their highest league placing in that time being 15th in both 2013 and 2014. This is not a club with a history of outperforming expectations.\n\nRoberto Soldado is leading the line for Granada, the sixth La Liga club of his career\n\nDiego Martinez has proved inspirational in guiding Granada up to fourth place in the table\n\nThat is what makes their start to the season so exceptional, they are flying in the face of the club's history \u2013 it is their best ever start to a top-flight campaign.\n\nThe belief that is flowing through the club comes from the top, in the shape of 38-year-old manager Diego Martinez.\n\nBefore the visit of Barcelona last month he confirmed his side would go toe-to-toe with the champions. There was no invoking of fairytale narratives, or an attempt to make life hard for their opponents. He promised that his side would go all out to win, against a team that spent \u00a3229m in the summer, over 28 times more than Granada.\n\n'I visualise it in a positive way, I visualise winning, although knowing of the difficulty of facing one of the best teams in the world, we are going to having to run a lot and very well, we have to squeeze ourselves to the fullest', Martinez said.\n\n'A lot of things separate us from Barcelona, \u200b\u200bwe belong to very different worlds and universes, but we have the conviction that anything can happen in a game.'\n\nAntonio Puertas celebrates with Soldado after scoring during last month's win over Leganes\n\nRamon Azeez's goal inside the first 60 seconds lit the touchpaper. The 2-0 victory that followed at the 19,336-capacity Estadio Nuevo Los Carmenes was their biggest result in five years.\n\nVictory sent them, albeit for just a few hours, top of La Liga. Nine of the players who started, all except Soldado and the Venezuelan Yangel Herrera, played in the Second Division last season.\n\nAzeez said afterwards: 'The recipe for beating Barcelona? Simple. We believed in ourselves and in the manager's visualisation of how we could do it. If we can continue on this path, the season can be anything we want.'\n\nTheir success comes from a well-defined game plan. They defend with organisation and aggression. They like to press the ball back and win it in the midfield transition. Then they look to spring forwards quickly.\n\nHerrera, a 21-year-old loan signing from Manchester City, has been a key addition to the side this season. The defensive midfielder has slotted in with ease, adding energy and intelligence on the ball and striking up an understanding already with Montoro.\n\nYangel Herrera (right), a loan signing from Manchester City, competes with Sergi Roberto\n\nDarwin Machis (right) retrieves the ball after scoring in the defeat by Real Madrid\n\nNEXT FIVE GAMES October 18: Osasuna H October 27: Real Betis H October 31: Getafe A November 3: Real Sociedad H November 10: Valencia A\n\nNow at his sixth La Liga club in an increasingly nomadic career, Soldado leads the line in in their 4-2-3-1.\n\nThe trio of Azeez, Darwin Machis and Antonio Puertas have become first-choice in the three behind the veteran striker.\n\nIt was the line-up that started against Barcelona, and at the Bernabeu at the weekend, where Granada recovered from going three-down to take it to 3-2 before James Rodriguez settled the match in injury time.\n\nDefeat in Madrid perhaps comes at the right time, with the international break allowing the club to recharge their batteries and re-calibrate their targets for the season.\n\nOnly three players \u2014 Azeez, Herrera and Machi \u2014 are away with their countries during the fortnight. After being granted two days off following their excursions in the capital, Granada's players were back at it in training on Tuesday.\n\nThey return to action on October 18, knowing that victory over Osasuna would send them up to the dizzying heights of second.\n\nCan it last? Favourable fixtures follow Osasuna in struggling Real Betis and a trip to Getafe before it really hots up in November.\n\nThe visit of Real Sociedad begins a stretch of four tough games that includes Valencia, Atletico Madrid and Athletic Bilbao.\n\nAfter beating Barcelona and giving Real Madrid a run for their money they won't be taken lightly. They've made a name for themselves already.\n\nGiant-killing is one thing, if the success continues they won't be the surprise package much longer. How they cope with being targeted will dictate the rest of the season.", "description": "Famed as one of the pearls of Spain, a tourist hot-spot known as the Moorish Jewel, Granada's sporting conquests are few and far between.
