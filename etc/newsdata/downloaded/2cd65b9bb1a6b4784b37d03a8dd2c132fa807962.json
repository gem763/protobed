There are also all-new \u201crift zones\u201d caused by a massive explosion that kicked off the season, and it sounds like they\u2019ll regularly change things up \u2014 and even bring back elements from past Fortnite seasons. \u201cLocations once thought to be lost are beginning to appear, but they aren\u2019t the same as they once were,\u201d developer Epic explains.\n\nThe most notable change on the island itself, meanwhile, is the long-awaited return of Dusty Depot \u2014 the meteor that destroyed it in season 4 is now suspended in the air. You can even land on it and explore. The explosion at Loot Lake is in a similarly suspended state, which is likely to change over the course of the season. Other map changes seem smaller, like the colorful new trees that have sprouted at the kaiju skeleton.\n\nSeason X is here and the island has changed!\n\n\n\nGet a look at the Map to see what\u2019s new \u2728 pic.twitter.com/l32wJrnY49 \u2014 Fortnite (@FortniteGame) August 1, 2019\n\nA new season also means a new battle pass, and this season\u2019s rewards seem in-keeping with the theme. Among other things, you\u2019ll be able to unlock new versions of classic characters, like a more futuristic take on the DJ Yonder \u2014 including a shocking unmasked variant. There\u2019s also a new legendary skin dubbed Ultima Knight, complete with a giant dragon glider. Iconic skin Rift, meanwhile, has been turned into a pet.\n\nRead next: The Fortnite World Cup Finals were a victory for Epic Games\n\nThere have also been some changes to the challenge structure, with a new series of \u201cmissions\u201d available, and more set to unlock over time. The missions available right now seem designed to get players trying specific things; namely getting in vehicles and playing the team rumble mode. It appears that the daily challenges from past seasons are no longer available.\n\nThe teases for Fortnite\u2019s 10th season started last weekend at the first-ever Fortnite World Cup, with an image that showed what appeared to be the previously destroyed Dusty Depot, along with the tagline \u201cthink back.\u201d Later teaser images kept up the time travel-focused theme, with lines like \u201ctwist time\u201d and \u201clook forward.\u201d Each image called back to a prior season of the game, and they were followed by a short trailer suggesting a huge explosion involving time travel.\n\nPrior to those teases, Epic kicked off arguably the most ambitious in-game event in Fortnite to date, with a massive clash between a giant pink robot and a very angry kaiju.\n\nFor the full rundown of season X, be sure to check out the patch notes.", "description": "Fortnite season 10 \u2014 officially dubbed season X \u2014 is finally upon us, and it adds a number of new features based on a time-bending theme.
