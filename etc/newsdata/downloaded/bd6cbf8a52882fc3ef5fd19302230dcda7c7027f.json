But it\u2019s raising complex and sometimes uncomfortable challenges.\n\nFor years, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s missing art\u2014much of which was looted during wartimes and ended up in collections across the globe\u2014didn\u2019t attract the level of attention devoted to higher-profile campaigns, such as Greece\u2019s efforts to wrest the Elgin Marbles back from Britain or Italy\u2019s tussles with California\u2019s Getty museum. Now new advocates are advancing the cause of African art.\n\nLate last year, a report commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron called for France to repatriate African artwork taken without consent during the colonial era, if the countries of origin ask for them back. More broadly, African cultural groups are putting pressure on governments to return disputed art. And a well-connected Congolese businessman is on a mission to track down works that disappeared from an Angolan museum during the country\u2019s civil war.\n\nCongolese businessman and art collector Sindika Dokolo has found and purchased 15 pieces so far that he intends to return to the museum in Dundo. Two of the works are now on exhibit at Bozar.

Then other claims may come, like rent,\u201d Mr. Oduro-Sarpong says. \u201cSomewhere along the line there must be a first step.\u201d\n\nA flywhisk\u2014an implement used to brush or swat away flies\u2014originally from the Dundo museum that was recovered by Mr. Dokolo, whose foundation continues to search for items missing from Dundo\u2019s museum.

In Belgium\u2019s Royal Museum for Central Africa, about 85% of its 125,000 ethnographical objects, which include everyday items like bowls and arrows, come from Congo. About 10% of those would be considered works of art, like carved wooden masks and statues, estimates Guido Gryseels, director general of the Belgian museum.\n\nHe says he has had informal discussions with Congolese officials and that the museum would be open to returning some disputed items and lending back others. \u201cWe need to facilitate access to those collections,\u201d he says. In particular, he says he\u2019s open to discussing the return of a few prized pieces as a show of goodwill, as well as objects proven to have been stolen during military expeditions or raids, of which Mr. Gryseels estimates there are fewer than 1,000.\n\nBut a major issue is that many of the works in the Royal Museum\u2019s collection were acquired and brought back to Belgium by missionaries: \u201cWhat were the conditions of the exchange?\u201d Mr. Gryseels said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most difficult part.\u201d\n\nDespite the informal talks, the Belgian museum so far hasn\u2019t received a formal request to return any objects, Mr. Gryseels says. \u201cThe Congolese officials have said to me on several occasions they don\u2019t want restitution as such\u2014what they do want is to have a more representative sample,\u201d Mr. Gryseels said. The Congo museum and government officials couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nA traditional mask from the Chokwe people of northern Angola that disappeared from the Dundo museum and is currently on exhibit at Bozar.

In Brussels, the Bozar fine arts center is staging an exhibition that includes two pieces set to return to Angola\u2019s Dundo Regional Museum after the show. The pieces had been tracked down by prominent Congolese collector Sindika Dokolo, who recovered them from private collections and then lent them, along with other artwork, to Bozar for the show.\n\nMr. Dokolo is waging a broader campaign to recover and return African artwork. A well-connected businessman, he is married to Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of former Angolan President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos and one of Africa\u2019s wealthiest women. Mr. Dokolo says he has found and purchased 15 pieces so far that he intends to return to the Dundo museum, including the two on display at Bozar. He says he typically confronts the current owners with evidence that a piece was stolen\u2014usually museum inventory cards that describe and depict the work. Then he makes an offer: \u201cThey need to show me what they paid and I pay them back what they paid for it\u2014which is not the market price\u2014because it\u2019s a stolen object,\u201d Mr. Dokolo said. \u201cIf they refuse to sell, my lawyers go after them. It\u2019s worked a few times.\u201d\n\nA carved wooden totem pole used as grave marker in some communities in Kenya.

One room features photographs of cards that describe missing items such as masks, statues and flywhisks. The exhibition\u2019s curator hopes the spotlight will put pressure on the collectors who now hold these pieces. \u201cThe large images on the wall are in known Belgian collections,\u201d says Kendell Geers, a South African artist and curator of the exhibition, called IncarNations. \u201c[The collectors] can do the right thing now quietly, or we can also put their names on the wall\u2026that would be the next step.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., at least one museum has successfully returned works to their country of origin. In July, the Denver Museum of Nature & Science gave a collection of 30 wooden grave markers to the Nairobi National Museum in Kenya.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How should museums handle disputes over artwork? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe markers had been donated to the Denver museum in the late 1980s or early 1990s, says Steve Nash, director of anthropology and senior curator of archaeology at the museum. He says the statues never really fit into the museum\u2019s collection, and had never been displayed. The museum was uncomfortable with the idea of holding the items: The community in Kenya that the markers came from believed they embodied a dead person\u2019s spirit or soul. \u201cWe think curating somebody\u2019s spirit is not a good idea,\u201d says Mr. Nash.\n\nHe says the museum had to navigate through Kenyan bureaucracy for over a decade, but eventually was able to return them. He does worry the statues now will suffer deterioration, since they\u2019ll be outside reinstalled on gravesites, where they\u2019re meant to be. \u201cAs a museum curator, I can say, \u2018Oh my God, what\u2019s going to happen with these things?,\u2019\u201d Mr. Nash said. \u201cBut they were stolen. Everything else that derived from that act was null and void.\u201d\n\nSeeking Returns\n\nSince the early 1980s, Greece has been trying to bring home the famous sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles, which the country says were looted from the Parthenon\u2019s frieze on the Acropolis two centuries ago by the British Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Thomas Bruce, the Seventh Earl of Elgin. The sculptures, on display at the British Museum in London since 1817, are perhaps the most famous example of a country seeking the return of its cultural heritage.\n\nThe Trustees of the British Museum believe that the \u201csculptures are part of everyone\u2019s shared heritage and transcend cultural boundaries,\u201d the British Museum writes on a section of its website dedicated to the controversy. \u201cThe Trustees remain convinced that the current locations of the Parthenon sculptures allows different and complementary stories to be told about the surviving sculptures, highlighting their significance for world culture and affirming the universal legacy of ancient Greece.\u201d\n\nSince the early 1980s, Greece has been trying to bring home the sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles, which the country says were looted from the Parthenon\u2019s frieze two centuries ago.

In February this year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York returned a gilded coffin to the government of Egypt, after learning that the coffin had been looted from the country. The Museum had purchased the coffin in July 2017 after vetting the purchase. The museum said it would review and revise its acquisitions process.\n\n\u201cAfter we learned that the Museum was a victim of fraud and unwittingly participated in the illegal trade of antiquities, we worked with the DA\u2019s office for its return to Egypt,\u201d Daniel Weiss, the Met\u2019s president and chief executive, said in a statement at the time. \u201cWe extend our apologies to\u2026the people of Egypt.\u201d\n\nWrite to Alexandra Wexler at alexandra.wexler@wsj.com", "description": "Advocates are pushing to return works to their original homes in Africa.
