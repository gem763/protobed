All the kids and the trainers are out of this world.\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\n\"When he's in the ring he's just like any other kid. We keep telling him he can do anything he wants, and he just gets on with everything.\n\n\"We started bringing Richard to watch, but I think it was frustrating for him. Then one day we were coming home and he said; 'Why can't I have legs like my brother and do what he does'.\"\n\nPaul Turnside, who runs Full Tilt Wrestling near Walkerville, Newcastle, helped Richard's dream come true.\n\n\"When I heard what Richard had said it broke my heart, and I just thought there's no reason why he can't take part,\" Paul said.\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\n\"We are open to everyone, sexuality, race and gender makes no difference whatsoever, and we have got kids with autism coming to sessions. I have seen his confidence grow.\n\n\"It's all about the will and the drive and the heart to do it. The ability doesn't really make a difference to what you can and can't do. And Richard is living proof of that.\n\n\"If Richard doesn't set an example to other kids I don't know what will.\"\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\nThe little boy will take part in a show next week with Italian pro-wrestler Nico Narciso, who is extending his trip to the UK just to join the youngster in the ring.\n\nBut in 2010, Richard was dashed to hospital with the telltale meningitis rash.\n\nThe youngster, who was born three months premature, was unlikely to survive, doctors conceded.\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\nHe fought for four months in hospital and eventually learned to walk with prosthetic legs.\n\nAnd he has been defying doctors ever since.\n\nMaureen, of Scotswood, Newcastle, continued: \"He just crawls all over the place and he bounces. He still manages to get about. Nothing stops him.\n\n\"His confidence is way up high now.\"", "description": "Richard Hunter, who battled meningitis from the brink of death, took to the ring at Full Tilt Wrestling in Walkerville, Newcastle", "authors": ["Sophie Doughty", "Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Newcastle Chronicle"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20661440.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Wrestling-fan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
