He wasn't alone. (AP Photo/David Richard)\n\nMayfield started things off after a ludicrous illegal blindside block penalty was called on Browns receiver Jarvis Landry during the third quarter of last week\u2019s loss to the Seattle Seahawks. He also predicted this punishment would be coming.\n\nFrom the Akron Beacon Journal:\n\n\u201cThe refs are never an excuse,\u201d Mayfield said in his postgame news conference. \u201cI\u2019ll probably get fined for saying this, but it was pretty bad today. [Seahawks rookie safety Marquise Blair was] squared up with [Landry], running at him, he\u2019s lowering his head into Jarvis. What\u2019s [Landry] supposed to do? Avoid him? This isn\u2019t bull fighting. I don\u2019t know. It ticks me off.\u201d\n\nWalker got his punishment after the worst-called game of the week: The debacle that was the Green Bay Packers\u2019 win over the Lions.\n\nIn a game that saw the Packers significantly helped by three blown calls in the game\u2019s final minutes, Walker joined Barry Sanders, Ninja and more in blasting the refs.\n\nFrom the Detroit Free Press:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cExtremely pissed off right now,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt is what it is. Disappointed. Hurt. We had that game. it\u2019s going \u2014 I\u2019m going to say the same [expletive], we should have won it. It is what it is, though. Got to bounce back.\u201d Asked who he was angry at, Walker said: \u201cHonestly, just the whole game in itself.\u201d \u201cI feel like we could have had a better game and we was supposed to come victorious with that game but Green Bay came to play,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was some awful, awful calls, but we got to play through that. We got to overcome those, and so we didn\u2019t, obviously, and we came up short.\u201d Told he might get fined for his comments, Walker said he didn\u2019t care.\n\nMatthews\u2019 comments were the most public of the three, and also came in the aftermath of the Packers-Lions game. The linebacker went so far as to call out Al Riveron, the NFL\u2019s vice president of officiating, by name.\n\nThe storyline for the 2019 season continues to be the refs inability to make the accurate and correct calls week in and week out. Al Riveron continues to blindly side with his refs and the current status quo. Something must change! Zero accountability. ...#throughthewire \u2014 Clay Matthews III (@ClayMatthews52) October 15, 2019\n\nAnd somehow, that\u2019s not even close to the most expensive tweet in the sports world this month.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Multiple players blasted the referees in the aftermath of last week's games.", "authors": ["Jack Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mXSXNBDgtqTpj9WZDIQanw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03NzcuNg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ldrSpus0Rgf2FbB0PECONQ--~B/aD0yMzkxO3c9MzkzNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/d87317f0-ee95-11e9-abde-7dbf581b093d", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
