Up is evil and down is good. People above me on the status hierarchy are venal, while those of us in my group are victims of their corruption. The existence of any hierarchy itself is prima facie proof of injustice.\n\nFrom the abstract vantage point of my computer screen, I see a world in which my opponents are elite oppressors and my kind are oppressed. They have their exclusive cliques and I am disdained. And here we get to the ultimate injustice: Why are they recognized while I am not? This is the molten core from which my indignation flows. The status quo does not respect me, and therefore I despise it.\n\nSo my politics is not really about issues, it\u2019s epic wars for recognition. I don\u2019t deal with the complexities of economics or foreign affairs. I seize upon the minor missteps made by my opponents in order to discredit their kind. You stumbled? I delight in crushing you! Owning the libs spares me the terrifying ambiguity of actually getting to know one.\n\nI\u2019ve lost faith in reason. Communication is for condemnation and arousal. Forgiveness has become foreign to me. Sometimes you have to be vicious for justice. If I afflict the comfortable I have served justice. I don\u2019t have to worry about comforting the afflicted. If I attack faraway wrongdoers I don\u2019t have to worry about tutoring a child.\n\nOnline war is a force that gives life meaning. Hatred gives me that delicious simulacrum of power. Did you really think you could raise me on gourmet coffee and yoga pants and I wouldn\u2019t find a way to rebel against your relativism and materialism? Didn\u2019t you observe the eternal pattern \u2014 that if you try to flatten a man to the bourgeois he will rebel by becoming a fanatic?\n\nAnd yet \u2026 somehow it\u2019s not working. Somehow politics doesn\u2019t fill my soul, bring me peace or end my existential anxiety. I have helped create a harsh world in which vulnerability is impossible and without vulnerability there can be no relationship. Relationship is the thing that I long for the most and that I make impossible. I have cut myself off from the only thing that can save me.\n\nI am indignant. I am superior. I read Dostoyevsky\u2019s \u201cNotes From the Underground.\u201d I am alone.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
