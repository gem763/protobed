(\u201cA man who drove his car to a music festival still cannot remember where he parked his car a week after the show,\u201d Jost said during last week\u2019s \u201cWeekend Update.\u201d). Recently, we reported that Davidson missed SNL because he was \u201coff pursuing another dream of his\u201d filming the new Suicide Squad movie, but we now know that he was, in fact, in the Upside Down. In host David Harbour\u2019s opening monologue, the Stranger Things star headed backstage only to discover a gate to the Upside Down had suddenly appeared. \u201cWhoever\u2019s behind these doors might need my help,\u201d he tells Kate McKinnon. \u201cI\u2019m going in.\u201d As he winds his way through the corridors, he eventually finds Davidson chilling with a llama. \u201cIs this where you\u2019ve been? In the Upside Down?\u201d he asks. Davidson, with a root-like tendril in his hands, replies, \u201cYeah, dude. It\u2019s lit.\u201d\n\nLater on, Davidson drops by \u201cWeekend Update\u201d to comment on the rise in some STD cases because of dating apps and to clap back at Jost for making fun of him in last week\u2019s episode. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the Joker,\u201d he says to Jost, \u201cbut I think you should start being waaay nicer to me.\u201d", "description": "Pete Davidson returns to \u201cSaturday Night Life\u201d after visiting the Upside Down in the cold open and drops by \u201cWeekend Update.\u201d", "authors": ["Trupti Rami"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/12/12-pete-davidson.w1200.h630.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
