As reported by Bloomberg and NBC News, Luckey\u2019s Anduril defense company is now offering a self-piloted drone called the Interceptor, which is designed to destroy other drones midflight by ramming them head-on.\n\nAs photographed by Bloomberg, the Interceptor resembles an off-the-shelf quadcopter on the scale of a Parrot drone, but Anduril has programmed the Interceptor with a specific protocol for defending the airspace around a given building. (As Anduril sees it, that building might be a military base, an oil rig, or a prison.) Given a certain block of airspace to defend, the drone will scan the space using the company\u2019s computer vision software and automatically ram any objects that intrude. Crucially, the Interceptor requires explicit permission before each attack.\n\nIn a demo to NBC News, the Interceptor was able to completely disable a drone hovering 100 feet off the ground, smashing into the craft from below and coming away unscathed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to apply this to people who are not just attacking a base with a quadcopter\u2014maybe they\u2019re attacking it in an ultralight aircraft, or a helicopter, or a cruise missile,\u201d Luckey told Bloomberg.\n\nAnduril has been the subject of significant controversy since its launch, primarily for its enthusiastic support of federal border control projects. The company\u2019s main product, called Lattice, is a computer vision system designed to identify migrants as they cross the border between the United States and Mexico. The system reportedly identified 55 people over the course of a 10-week trial in 2018.\n\nLattice has already found some success in contracts with the Department of Defense, recently securing a $13.5 million contract at a border-adjacent Marine Corps base. It\u2019s still unclear how broadly the technology is being used by US border agencies specifically, but a spokesperson told NBC News that it\u2019s working with roughly a dozen agencies across the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security.", "description": "Anduril (the new project of Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey) has created a self-piloted drone called the Interceptor, which is designed to destroy other drones midflight by ramming them head-on.", "authors": ["Russell Brandom", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C9U3e4GK6BIX459SbMHBVgPGAdI=/0x196:5568x3111/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19255972/1145546851.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
