The kitchen is too small for a stove, so he simmers brisket in an industrial-sized rice cooker before shredding it and cooking it a second time with fire-roasted chilies, tomatoes, and heaps of grated cheese. The result, wrapped in a fragrant, chewy handmade tortilla, is perfectly spiced and mouthwateringly unctuous. Everyone will want seconds.\n\nFeatured in: A Homemade Flour Tortilla To Rival Its Corn Counterpart.", "description": "Teo Diaz grew up eating chivichangas, or small burritos typically filled with stewed meat, almost every day in San Luis, Arizona, just miles from the U.S.-Mexico border His single mother would prepare a dozen or more of them early each morning before heading out to pick and pack produce in the fields of nearby Yuma, wrapping them individually in aluminum foil and leaving them on the counter for her six children to eat throughout the day Now the chivi, as he calls it, is one of the most beloved items on the menu at his tiny downtown Los Angeles taqueria, Sonoratown", "authors": ["Samin Nosrat", "Martha Rose Shulman", "Julia Moskin", "Samantha Seneviratne", "Sarah Digregorio", "Claire Saffitz", "Melissa Clark"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/07/magazine/07mag-eat-image2/07mag-eat-image2-articleLarge.jpg"}
