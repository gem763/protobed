He also vehemently denied any accusations that his campaign had been racist.\n\nBut he later posted a photo of the Palestinian flag projected over a Tel Aviv skyscraper warning his supporters if did not go out to vote, \u201cthis is how it will end\u201d.\n\nAs voting was underway he ratcheted up the messaging in a slew of videos warning of high Arab turnout.\n\n\"[The media] says the percentage of voters is surprising. It's high among the Arab population. It's not surprising.
