She told Elmhirst she's a different person every day \u2014 and she wakes up and delighted by that.\n\nIt wasn't always so easy to be open about her sexuality, Stewart explained. \"I was informed by an old school mentality, which is \u2014 you want to preserve your career and your success and your productivity, and there are people in the world who don't like you, and they don't like that you date girls, and they don't like that you don't identify as a quote unquote 'lesbian,' but you also don't identify as a quote unquote 'heterosexual.' And people like to know stuff, so what the f*** are you?'\"\n\nStella Maxwell and Kristen Stewart attend the Women in Motion Awards Dinner during the Cannes Film Festival on May 13, 2018.

The 29-year-old told Harper's Bazaar she'd be happy if she can make conversations about sexuality easier.\n\nWhile at one point Stewart was warned that public displays of affection could prevent her from getting movie roles, now people want to make movies about her and her \"undefined sexuality,\" Elmhirst writes.\n\n\"Literally, life is a huge popularity contest,\" Stewart said. The actress knows about popularity \u2014 as a teen, she was cast in the starring role of the \"Twilight\" series, based on the hugely popular young adult book series. She starred in five \"Twilight\" films in five years, which grossed over $1.3 billion, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\nSince then, Stewart has starred in several blockbuster movies, and next up is a \"Charlie's Angel\" remake alongside Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska. Elizabeth Banks will also star in the movie as one of multiple \"Bosley\" characters \u2014 a role traditionally played by men.\n\nSo, although Stewart has yet to be cast in a Marvel movie, she's found a new hero franchise of her own \u2014 inspiring others by being herself.", "description": "Stewart opened up to Harper's Bazaar about her sexuality, saying she no longer cares if it impacts her career", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/04/a511ea73-f75d-4b96-a764-4b0b7cdc0cae/thumbnail/1200x630/380b665d8e41c3bd28beeb97ee3ea8ce/gettyimages-1171197839.jpg"}
