As a scheme for keeping asylum seekers as far away from the US as possible it could be effective \u2013 and with very harmful consequences.\n\n\u201cEl Salvador has a staggeringly high homicide rate, similarly Honduras. Guatemala isn\u2019t as bad but it is still elevated. And these are countries from which hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing, many of them from targeted threats,\u201d Long added.\n\nEric Olson, a Central America specialist from Washington\u2019s Woodrow Wilson Centre, said Northern Triangle countries lacked even the most basic institutional infrastructure to receive so many rejected asylum seekers.\n\nWhile the United States handled hundreds of thousands of asylum applications last year, El Salvador received just 20.\n\n\u201cWhat it does is put vulnerable, weak countries at greater risk, and migrants who have a legitimate claim to asylum are also put at greater risk. That is the bottom line,\u201d Olson said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest African migrants protest during a march demanding humanitarian visas that would enable them to cross Mexico on their way to the US, in Tapachula, Chiapas state, Mexico, on the border with Guatemala, on 30 August 2019.

Maybe if it were Switzerland it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. But these are vulnerable, weak countries.\u201d\n\nIduvina Hern\u00e1ndez, a Guatemalan journalist and human rights activist, said she feared her country\u2019s health system could collapse under the strain of the new arrivals.\n\n\u201cIf the health system is [already] unable to provide services to Guatemalans, how can it possibly provide services to hundreds of thousands of people from Honduras and El Salvador as well?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt will trigger a humanitarian crisis.\u201d\n\nGiven the massive stress the US deals are likely to place on their countries, many wonder why El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have signed up to such schemes, details of which remain sketchy.\n\nGuatemala in grip of 'mafia coalition', says UN body in scathing corruption report Read more\n\nHern\u00e1ndez said she suspected the US-Guatemala deal was \u201ca product of the [Guatemalan] president\u2019s need for impunity\u201d. Jimmy Morales, the country\u2019s outgoing leader, came to power nearly four years ago promising to battle corruption but has himself become embroiled in scandal with a UN-backed anti-corruption commission forced from the country earlier this month.\n\nThere is similar speculation in Honduras, where President Hern\u00e1ndez is caught up in a major drug trafficking investigation which will see his brother go on trial in the US next month.\n\nOlson called such speculation \u201cpreposterous\u201d, arguing it would be impossible for a US president to guarantee impunity to any foreign leader.\n\nBut the deals did underscore the lopsided nature of relations between the US and its far poorer regional neighbours who are massively reliant on it for trade, aid and remittances from their nationals who live there.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an indication of how vulnerable these countries are vis-a-vis the Trump administration. The US carries a huge stick,\u201d Olson said. \u201cThere is too much at play for these small countries. They are just not in a position to resist the enormous pressure that the US puts on them.\u201d\n\nTrump has celebrated his migration deals as a major victory for his administration, this week claiming he had \u201csort of solved asylum\u201d. \u201cMass illegal migration is unfair, unsafe and unsustainable for everyone involved,\u201d Trump told the UN.\n\nBut Long warned his project to bar asylum seekers and migrants would ultimately fail. \u201cNothing is changing about the circumstances forcing people to flee or their desperation. But things are changing to make the outcomes worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the last 10 years more Hondurans have died than in 10 years of civil war in El Salvador,\u201d said Bartolo Fuentes, a Honduran migrant activist, who also believes Trump will be unable to stop migrants trying to outrun the killing.\n\n\u201cSometimes our death rates have gone above Syria\u2019s \u2013 and we don\u2019t have the war.\u201d", "description": "The US has signed agreements to send vulnerable asylum seekers to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador \u2013 experts describe the plan as a recipe for disaster", "authors": ["Tom Phillips", "Jo Tuckman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/424062783dce71fcbf7ded5d62eb3c038927ff60/0_184_3192_1915/master/3192.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4ddb3436cce3e4175ea5af0b2255186a", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
