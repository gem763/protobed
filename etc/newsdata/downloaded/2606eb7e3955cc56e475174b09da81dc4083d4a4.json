Despite that, he said he hoped he felt no ill will.\n\n\u201cSo, John is somebody that I actually got along with very well. He made some very big mistakes,\u201d Mr Trump said a day after Mr Bolton was either fired or resigned.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

He\u2019s so tough he got us into Iraq,\u201d said Mr Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s actually somebody I had a very good relationship with, but he wasn\u2019t getting along with people in the administration that I consider very important.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

At a press conference on Tuesday \u2013 one that Mr Bolton was supposed to have taken part in \u2013 the secretary of state said he was \u201cnever surprised\u201d, when asked if he had been blindsided by news of the dismissal of his rival.\n\nMr Trump insisted his administration was looking at five \u201cvery highly qualified\u201d people to succeed the Mr Bolton, 70, even as his public rebuke of the departed official underscored the trepidation many might feel before taking on such a role.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be announcing somebody next week, but we have some very highly qualified people,\u201d he said.\n\nReports suggested that among the names being talked about were Stephen Biegun, the special US envoy on North Korea; Richard Grenell, the US ambassador to Germany; US hostage negotiator Robert O\u2019Brien, and deputy secretary of state John Sullivan.\n\nWhile Mr Bolton had publicly called for the US to bring about a change of government in Tehran, Mr Trump \u2013 having pulled the US out of the Iran deal that had been signed by Barack Obama \u2013 has indicated he believes he can broker a new arrangement.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

I think Iran has potential and I think North Korea. I think Iran has a tremendous potential. They\u2019re incredible people. We\u2019re not looking for regime change.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Mr Bolton was blamed by the administration when efforts to move forward with denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula suffered a setback, when Mr Trump followed Mr Bolton\u2019s advice at a summit in Hanoi and handed Kim Jong-un a piece of paper that bluntly called for the transfer of Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons and bomb fuel.\n\nNorth Korea had denounced Mr Bolton as a \u201cwar maniac\u201d and \u201chuman scum\u201d. In turn, Mr Bolton had proposed using military force to overthrow the ruling Kim family.\n\nMr Trump told reporters on Wednesday: \u201cThis could be one of the most unbelievable experiments ever, North Korea.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "description": "Donald Trump has launched a blistering attack on John Bolton, accusing the ousted adviser of making a number of \u201cbig mistakes\u201d, including pushing for the 2003 US invasion of Iraq.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/13/trumpbolton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
