We are watching for earnings releases from tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB). Our analysts are not forecasting a rebound in iPhone unit sales this year, based on Apple\u2019s product showcase in September where the iPhone 11 demonstrated marginal product improvements. Analysts also suspect many users will opt to wait for a 5G-compatible iPhone in 2020, and this is particularly true in Chinese markets.\n\nFacebook continues to face criticism and scrutiny from consumers and politicians; CEO Mark Zuckerberg stood in front of Congress for questioning last week. However, Facebook demonstrated strong second-quarter performance, powered by its user growth, steady engagement, and higher user monetization.\n\nLeaders in oil including Exxon Mobil (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RYDBF), and Chevron (CVX) are due for earnings reports this week as well. In financial services, we are watching HSBC (HSBC), Visa (VISA), and Mastercard (MA). Other notable names include Pfizer (PFE), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), Starbucks (SBUX), and Alibaba (BABA).\n\nThe Fed is scheduled to meet Wednesday; speculation about another interest-rate cut is brewing. A bundle of economic data is due, including consumer confidence on Tuesday and unemployment rate on Friday.", "description": "The Fed\u2019s meeting is scheduled for next week, sparking speculations of another interest-rate cut.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt82be987fd176accb/5cf5932bd8bbe50306d29a7c/Saving_1x1.svg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
