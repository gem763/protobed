Here are a few post-fight musings \u2026\n\n* * * * *\n\n1. Ben Askren\u2019s disastrous UFC run\n\nLet\u2019s be frank: This run in the UFC has not been kind to Ben Askren (19-2 MMA, 1-2 UFC). Outside of his mouth, he\u2019s failed to live up to pretty much all the hype that was around him when he finally joined the promotion, and he\u2019s only had a few successful moments through three UFC fights.\n\nAskren\u2019s submission loss to Demian Maia marked the time to put his brief UFC run under the microscope. He debuted in March with an undefeated record after 18 fights, and while he technically beat Robbie Lawler at UFC 235, he took a lot of punishment and was on the cusp of being finished before a wild reversal of fortune saw him get a submission win despite Lawler never tapping out.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to rehash what happened with Jorge Masvidal after that. The five-second loop of Askren being stopped with the quickest knockout in UFC history has been endlessly replayed over the past three months, but everyone loses eventually, and it was acceptable for Askren to write off the outcome as him being caught with an unpredictable shot.\n\nThe loss to Maia will be much harder to digest, though. Askren was placed in what should\u2019ve been a good stylistic matchup against another grappler, and while he had some moments, Maia had the more impactful performance, ending with him choking Askren out cold.\n\nIs Askren officially a bust? It\u2019s still too soon to say. There\u2019s many positive and negative implications to his presence inside the octagon that can be discussed in more depth at a later date. His bank account has more cushion than it would\u2019ve otherwise, but in terms of results only, it\u2019s certain this isn\u2019t what Askren envisioned for himself in the UFC.", "description": "Post-fight thoughts and analysis from UFC on ESPN+ 20, which saw Demian Maia submit Ben Askren in the main event in Singapore.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Blue Corner", "Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "Matt Erickson", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Abbey Subhan", "John Morgan", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/demian-maia-ben-askren-ufc-singapore-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
