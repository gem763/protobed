They're just too complicated for people to use.\"\n\nImage copyright Gov.uk Image caption Emergency bays have been built to replace the hard shoulder\n\nThere are two types of Smart motorway in the UK.\n\nThe first is where the hard shoulder is opened to traffic when it is busy.\n\nThe second is where the hard shoulder is open all the time.\n\nDespite his comments about dynamic lanes, Mr O'Sullivan claimed smart motorways were at least as safe as conventional motorways.\n\nOpponents argue the removal of a permanent hard shoulder puts drivers at risk.\n\nDerek Jacobs, 83, was killed when his car was hit after it stopped on a section of the M1 in Derbyshire.\n\nAbout six months earlier another woman was killed after a breakdown on the same stretch of road.\n\nJason Mercer, 44, died on the M1 near Sheffield, where the hard shoulder is an active lane.\n\nHe was involved in a minor collision but when he got out his car to exchange details he and the other driver were hit by a lorry. Both died at the scene.\n\nHis widow Clare said she was astounded Highways England had actually admitted there was a problem.\n\n\"They should never have been implemented,\" she said.", "description": "Highways England says it has no plans to build any new dynamic smart motorways amid confusion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7752/production/_107564503_red-x.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
