The Washington Post\u2019s Paul Kane reports on the \u201cwhiplash moment\u201d currently befalling Democrats as the New York Times\u2019 rehashed smear job on Brett Kavanaugh comes apart. Kane notes that Republicans have gone on offense right in the lead, while waiting more than a dozen paragraphs to note that Democrats actually pounced first.\n\nKane laments this \u201cfamiliar refrain,\u201d which is perhaps a little more familiar than even Kane appreciates:\n\nSince the first allegations emerged a year ago Monday, in a Washington Post story, the Kavanaugh saga has evolved in a familiar refrain. Seemingly credible accusations get made; Democrats pounce and demand investigations. Republicans grow quiet, until some other allegation emerges that appears to go too far. Then Republicans go into full umbrage mode, pushing Democrats back until the nominee is confirmed (or, in this week\u2019s case, until Democrats change the subject).\n\n\u201cSeemingly credible,\u201d eh? That\u2019s the start of Kane\u2019s problem in describing this pattern. The allegations against Kavanaugh weren\u2019t \u201cseemingly credible\u201d at any stage, and got less credible as scrutiny increased. Christine Blasey Ford offered up an ambiguous claim of an assault from more than thirty years ago at a time she couldn\u2019t name, a place she couldn\u2019t identify, with people present who say they have no recollection of the event at which this assault allegedly took place. Despite Kavanaugh being in public life for years, Blasey Ford had never come forward to make this claim, and hadn\u2019t even told others until decades after it supposedly happened. Blasey Ford offered the names of four people she claimed would verify her story, only to have all four eventually deny that anything of the sort happened \u2014 and at least one of whom eventually said she had no confidence in Blasey Ford\u2019s credibility.\n\nHow is that \u201cseemingly credible\u201d? In what journalistic world does an uncorroborated and ambiguous claim with so few details that it\u2019s impossible to check become \u201cseemingly credible\u201d enough to print? It was only \u201cseemingly credible\u201d to partisans and media outlets that were and are already primed to dislike Kavanaugh. It was that assignment of credibility to Blasey Ford\u2019s claim that encouraged \u201csome other allegation[s] that appear[] to go too far\u201d to emerge, a dynamic that Kane apparently never considers.\n\nKane continues by reducing the Times\u2019 travails this week to a \u201cjournalistic mishap\u201d:\n\nBut the Times story included another allegation of similar behavior that drew most of the attention, until editors posted an update Sunday that included the denial by the alleged victim. Like Graham a year ago, Republicans jumped on this journalistic mishap to try to destroy the overall content of the book. \u201cI\u2019m distressed by the declining journalistic principals, so much on display,\u201d McConnell said Tuesday.\n\nA \u201cjournalistic mishap\u201d? A \u201cjournalistic mishap\u201d is using the wrong form of the word \u201cprinciples\u201d in the above quote. What the New York Times and its reporters did was pass along the rotted fruit of campus gossip from more than thirty years ago without any substantiation at all. The Times knowingly published an allegation that was easily shot down, while not including the following information that was already in the source material:\n\nThe new allegation came from a thirdhand anonymous source describing what a secondhand source told the FBI last year\n\nThe reporters never talked to the secondhand source, Max Stier\n\nThe reporters never talked to the victim either (although they did know she denies it ever happened)\n\nStier was represented as a good-governance advocate without disclosing the fact that he also was an attorney who represented Bill Clinton in the Lewinsky scandal\n\nThe article and the book reference Leland Keyser in establishing Blasey Ford\u2019s credibility when Keyser explicitly told them that she doesn\u2019t \u201chave any confidence\u201d in Blasey Ford\u2019s story\n\nThat\u2019s a \u201cjournalistic mishap\u201d in the same manner that a massive derailment might be described as a \u201cslight delay.\u201d The article is a trainwreck of bad journalism attempting to reinvigorate an egregious character assassination without any evidence at all. Kane\u2019s attempt to turn this yellow-journalism embarrassment into a Republicans Pounce! narrative is a faceplant all its own.\n\nAt least some Democrats have the good sense to change the subject.
