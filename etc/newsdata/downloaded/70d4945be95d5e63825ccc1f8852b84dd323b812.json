Freight rates for supertankers across the globe to ship oil, particularly to Asia, have surged.\n\nOccidental provisionally chartered the Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) Hong Kong Spirit for US$15.8 million for departure to Asia next month, sources said. That does not mean the voyage will actually be completed.\n\nBids for chartering VLCCs from the US Gulf Coast to Asia were assessed on Friday as high as US$20 million, shipbrokers said, though no charters had been booked at that price, sources said.\n\n\"The recent surge in tanker earnings is unprecedented,\" ship broker Poten & Partners said in a note on Friday. \"As rates reach into the stratosphere, it seems that the market will take a breather sooner or later. Many of the tankers that have recently been fixed or put on subjects don't know their loading dates yet.\"\n\nIn the Arab Gulf, Indian Oil Corp was offered rates in a range of US$8.2 million to US$16 million to ship Iraqi Basra crude to Chennai, India, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nRates from Basra to Visakhapatnam, India, for VLCCs reached US$2.24 per barrel this week, highest in at least a year, Eikon data showed.
