He has a nonconformist ethos that would never allow him to become a shill for a transit agency viewed by some as a necessary evil: convenient for a densely packed region but frustrating with its delays and limited service hours.\n\nLast week, as drivers flocked to Twitter to complain about the \u201cclimate rebels\u201d blocking D.C. intersections to raise awareness for climate change, Munro coyly changed his Twitter display name to \u201cJoyous DC Commuter,\u201d denoting the protest-free Metro ride he took to work.\n\nThe truth is: He likes Metro.\n\n\u201cWhen the [station platform] board says your train is going to be there in five minutes, it\u2019s going to be there in five minutes \u2014 give or take a few minutes,\u201d said Munro, who works in the District managing art collection databases. \u201cIt works fairly well for what I need it for, which is commuting to and fro around the city.\u201d\n\nThe mostly sunny outlook seems to be shared by millions of Americans who are returning to the rails \u2014 and other forms of public transportation \u2014 in a surprising upswing.\n\nAmericans took 2.5 billion passenger trips on public transportation in the second quarter of 2019 \u2014 11 million more trips than during the same period last year, according to the latest report by the American Public Transportation Association.\n\n\n\nRail commuters pass through the McPherson Square Metro station. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nThe increase in subway ridership was largely driven by the New York subway and Metro.\n\nSome places, including King County, Wash., Sacramento and Minneapolis, showed significant gains in light-rail ridership. Commuter rail systems in central Florida, Denver and New York also had big increases. And ridership for the Blacksburg, Va., bus system was up nearly 28 percent for the second quarter of the year, according to the transportation association\u2019s report.\n\nFor transit officials, the optimistic snapshot affirms that the billions spent on infrastructure projects and maintenance overhauls in recent years have translated into better service that is bringing back customers.\n\n[From the archives: Metro sank into crisis despite decades of warnings]\n\nMetro reported that daily passenger trips increased 2.3 percent for the first six months of 2019, with ridership for April, May and June up 3.3 percent compared with the same period last year.\n\n\n\nRiders board a Metrobus near the Woodmoor shopping center in Silver Spring. (Luz Lazo/The Washington Post)\n\nIn New York, the country\u2019s largest and busiest rapid transit system, ridership was up 2.6 percent for April, May and June.\n\nAtlanta and Boston subways also posted ridership gains, while the other big-city systems \u2014 Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Los Angeles \u2014 reported declines, according to the association report.\n\nStill, officials find the data encouraging, especially for cities such as Washington and New York, where the troubled transit systems are more likely to make headlines for their problems than gains.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that there\u2019s a couple of things going on,\u201d said Paul Lewis, vice president of policy and finance at the Eno Center for Transportation. \u201cOne is that they\u2019ve made some strategic investments. A couple of years ago, both [Metro and New York] have really struggled with some station shutdowns, and now they\u2019re winning back riders.\u201d\n\n[For public transit agencies losing riders, microtransit might be an answer]\n\nIndeed, while figures show that New York subway ridership in the first six months of 2019 was down slightly when compared with 2018, the surge of riders in the spring was good news for a transportation agency that has been losing riders and is under pressure to make dramatic changes. Late last month, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board approved a $51.5 billion improvement plan that will create more access for riders with disabilities, add nearly 2,000 subway cars and make critical repairs at about 175 stations.\n\nAt Metro, the ridership gains come after years of steep declines, starting in 2015, following the fatal L\u2019Enfant Plaza smoke incident and continuing as decades of disrepair and neglect caught up with the system. The year-long SafeTrack rebuilding program shut down portions of lines for days and weeks at a time, and some of those riders never returned. There were fare increases and service cuts.\n\nBetween 2009 and May 2018, Metro lost an average of 124,000 trips per day, that\u2019s equal to the population of Hartford, Conn., if each trip represented one rider. At its peak in 2008, Metro had an average weekday ridership of 750,000. In 2018, average weekday ridership fell to 595,000, a threshold that hadn\u2019t been crossed since 2000.\n\n[Metro ridership hits low point]\n\nBut riders have begun to return and the system is showing steady long-term growth, Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said.\n\nAverage weekday ridership declined the past three years, but Metro projects average weekday trips will hit 610,000 this year, a calculation that includes real statistics up to September.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that Metrorail ridership has stabilized and even begun to show some growth,\u201d Stessel said. \u201cMetrorail has been posting year-over-year ridership gains each month starting in February and continuing through the spring.\u201d\n\nTo the transit agency, this year has been especially encouraging because the increase is happening even while factoring losses of nearly 50,000 riders a day during the federal government shutdown in January and losses related to the summer-long closure of six Blue and Yellow line stations for a platform rebuilding project. Ridership has rebounded to 90 percent of pre-summer shutdown levels, General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said at a recent board meeting.\n\n[Officials warn residents to prepare for 15-week shutdown]\n\nMetro officials credit the agency\u2019s maintenance programs and service improvements. They tout the transit system\u2019s weekday on-time performance of 90 percent, and have backed it up with a rush-hour guarantee that credits passengers for trips delayed by 10 minutes or more.\n\nSoftware engineer James Pizzurro, a rider advocate who has used Metro for eight years, however, said people shouldn\u2019t draw conclusions as to what\u2019s behind gains.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly good and it\u2019s hard to argue that there aren\u2019t more riders using the system if that\u2019s what the numbers show,\u201d Pizzurro said. \u201cThe question is as to why before making sure it\u2019s a long-term trend.\u201d\n\nPatrick J. Foye, chairman and chief executive of New York\u2019s MTA, said infrastructure improvements since the launch of an $800 million Subway Action Plan have translated into ridership gains for his system. MTA boasts similar metrics to Metro, with weekday on-time performance of 84 percent, up from 69 percent in August 2018.\n\nBut beyond MTA\u2019s upgrades, which have included overhauling more than 2,500 cars, installing more than 50 miles of rail and being more upfront with riders about delays instead of a generic, exasperating \u201ctrain traffic ahead\u201d warning, Foye said \u201ca buoyant state and regional economy\u201d has brought riders back to rail. The most affordable way for employees to get to those new jobs? The subway.\n\nSolo drivers\n\nA regional commuting survey released last month by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments found that people driving to work alone remains the most used method of commuting, but it is decreasing \u2014 from 61 percent in 2016 to 58 percent this year. At the same time, the satisfaction rate of those who use Metro as their primary mode of commuting was 56 percent, up from 48 percent in 2016.\n\nBut some transit advocates said the emphasis on improving Metro has allowed other transit to suffer. Andrew Kierig, vice chairman of Metro\u2019s Riders Advisory Council, said the growing maintenance needs of Metrobus are repeatedly deferred. The transportation association report showed that while Americans took more bus trips in the second quarter of this year than last year, particularly in cities such as Oakland, Calif., and Denver, Metrobus reported a 3.4 percent decrease in ridership for the first six months of this year.\n\n\u201cRail is great,\u201d Kierig said. \u201cI take rail everyday. But for people who take the bus every day and can\u2019t live next to a Metro station, they don\u2019t have a choice but to take the bus.\u201d\n\n[Metrobus service barely passing according to new report card]\n\nMunro, who grew up in New Hampshire and drove everywhere until he moved to Columbia Heights nearly a year ago, said he knows Metro still has a lot of work ahead to win back customers. He, for example, wants later hours, free bus-to-train transfers, and a fare system that requires riders to only swipe their card once, similar to New York\u2019s.\n\nWhile social media anger toward Metro developed over years of service declines, safety lapses and a perception of indifference, Munro said, the bashing now seems more like ranting than constructive criticism. As an outsider who has never relied on public transit until now, Munro said Metro has important environmental and intrinsic value.\n\nRides give him time to read books on his phone. The brutalist architecture of station ceilings, tortoiseshell awnings and long escalator climbs into the heart of the District with streams of people of all backgrounds gives a feeling of being part of something. \u201cIt unites us,\u201d he said.\n\nMost importantly, he said, Metro takes cars off the road.\n\n\u201cEven if [Metro] is what all these people say, it\u2019s still a better option when you\u2019re staring down the barrel of climate catastrophe,\u201d he said.\n\nAs he said he saw people on Twitter recently play down recent Metro successes, he again came to the system\u2019s defense, calling out some of its regular critics for \u201cnormalizing\u201d a culture that allows people to think Metro is inherently bad.\n\n\u201cPeople at work still joke with me about how Metro is always on fire, or the trains are delayed all the time, but not only is that more often than not wrong, it diminishes the people for who Metro is their best (or only!) choice,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cLike people die everyday on area roadways, drivers and or peds/bikes alike!\u201d he added. \u201cThat is not the case on Metro!\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nMetro will stay open late as long as Nationals are in the playoffs\n\nBowser renews push for Metro to restore late-night hours\n\nMetro board revises ethics code in wake of scandal", "description": "Americans have taken millions more rides on public transportation this year.
