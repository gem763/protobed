Robert Morey said in a statement on Monday. \u201cHoly Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that. Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching. As a priest, it is my responsibility to minister to those souls entrusted to my care, and I must do so even in the most difficult situations. I will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers.\u201d\n\nBiden, who earlier this year condemned state legislation across the country that barred women from having the procedure, said: \u201cI\u2019m a practicing Catholic. I practice my faith, but I\u2019ve never let my religious beliefs, which I accept based on Church doctrine \u2026 impose \u2026 on other people.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Fox News", "Foxnews.Com Politics Biden-On-Being-Denied-Communion-Im-A-Practicing-Catholic-I-Practice-My-Faith"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
