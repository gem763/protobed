Terrence Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nRepresentatives for Brown and Taylor have had discussions over the past few months but agreed to keep those discussions confidential before the suit was filed, sources told ESPN.\n\nThe confidentiality agreement could provide an explanation for Brown not notifying the Raiders nor the Patriots before he signed with New England on Monday.\n\nThe NFL plans to meet next week with Taylor, according to ESPN. Taylor, Brown\u2019s former trainer, filed the lawsuit with the Southern District of Florida, accusing the wide receiver of sexually assaulting her on three occasions.\n\n\u2014Quarterback Sam Darnold is out indefinitely with mono and will not play Monday when the New York Jets host the Cleveland Browns. But that\u2019s only the beginning of the bad news spreading for New York.\n\nDarnold could wind up missing more than just one game, coach Adam Gase said, and he has already lost weight. The Jets play the New England Patriots in Week 3 before a bye the following week.\n\nLe\u2019Veon Bell played his first NFL game in 20 months last week, and the new Jets running back appeared to hold up fine. Gase said Bell would not practice because of a sore shoulder, and ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported Bell was scheduled for an MRI exam. ESPN\u2019s Jeremy Fowler reported the exam was \u201cmostly precautionary\u201d and didn\u2019t show any major damage or tears.\n\n\u2014Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. accused New York Jets defensive coordinator Gregg Williams of encouraging \u201cdirty hits\u201d and said the coach\u2019s tactics cost him much of the 2017 season.\n\nBeckham injured his ankle in a 2017 preseason game against the Browns, whose defense was coached by Williams. The receiver, then with the New York Giants, eventually broke the ankle and missed 12 games that year.\n\n\u201cI had players on this team telling me that\u2019s what he was telling them to do: take me out of the game, and it\u2019s preseason,\u201d Beckham told reporters. \u201cSo you just know who he is. That\u2019s the man who\u2019s calling the plays.\u201d\n\n\u2014San Francisco rookie edge rusher Nick Bosa plans to play Sunday at Cincinnati, 49ers general manager John Lynch said.\n\nBosa hasn\u2019t practiced this week due to ankle soreness. Lynch said the No. 2 overall pick in April\u2019s NFL draft aggravated his injury on the first snap in last week\u2019s 31-17 win at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll work kind of limited throughout the week, but he\u2019s fully intending on playing,\u201d Lynch said on 95.7 The Game, via the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cAs far as the snaps, we\u2019ll kind of see how that goes.\u201d\n\n\u2014Eight players in their first year of eligibility highlight the 122 nominees for the Pro Football Hall of Fame\u2019s Class of 2020.\n\nNominees include 63 offensive players, 43 defensive players and 16 from special teams. All represent the \u201cmodern era\u201d of football, classified as players whose careers ended within the past 25 years.\n\nFirst-time nominees are running back Maurice Jones-Drew; wide receiver Reggie Wayne; safety Troy Polamalu; linebackers Lance Briggs and Patrick Willis; special teamer Josh Cribbs; and defensive linemen Justin Smith and John Abraham.\n\n\u2014The NFL suspended Buffalo Bills rookie linebacker Tyrel Dodson six games without pay for violating the league\u2019s personal-conduct policy.\n\nThe suspension begins immediately for Dodson, who had been on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list since rosters were cut to 53 players before the season-opening weekend.\n\n\u2014Oakland Raiders cornerback Gareon Conley was listed as limited on the practice report, but he is set to play Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nDefensive coordinator Paul Guenther told reporters that Conley will be \u201cgood to go\u201d after what initially appeared to be a potentially serious neck injury.\n\n\u2014Washington Redskins running back Derrius Guice is expected to miss at least six weeks after undergoing surgery on his right knee.\n\nGuice visited Dr. James Andrews on Thursday for a second opinion on his ailing knee, and the famed orthopedist performed the operation, Redskins head coach Jay Gruden confirmed. Gruden said the surgery was \u201cminor.\u201d\n\n\u2014In a quest for a safer helmet, the NFL is starting a $3 million program aimed at the development of new headgear that outperforms anything currently available.\n\nManufacturers, engineers and entrepreneurs all are welcome to submit prototypes in the NFL Helmet Challenge, with the goal of reducing head trauma.\n\nThe league will provide $2 million in grant funding to support development, with as much as $1 million awarded for a prototype that would be used to help reduce concussions.", "description": "Neither the New England Patriots nor the Oakland Raiders were aware of rape allegations involving Antonio Brown until a civil sexual-assault lawsuit was filed by Britney Taylor, ESPN reported Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429286305&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C071-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
