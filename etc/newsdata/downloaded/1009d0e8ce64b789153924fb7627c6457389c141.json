Taylor Gerring, executive director of the Institute, says:\n\nOur mission is simple: to provide education material and courses for all that are interested in learning about this new technology.\n\nIndeed, blockchain education has become an important factor in the growth of the industry.

This is done when the customer provides a cell phone number to the kiosk. Following a brief text designed to validate one\u2019s identity, the trading can commence.\n\nThe primary difference between kiosks and ATMs is that kiosks operate more like automated tellers and exchange digital coins for USD or USD for digital coins.\n\nExpanding to Other Territory\n\nDalesandro explains:", "description": "Rock It Coin, a bitcoin kiosk company in Chicago, is joining hands with the Blockchain institute to install its 200th machine.", "authors": ["Nick Marinoff"], "top_image": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2018/11/ss-dna-blockchain.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
