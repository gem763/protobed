Days ahead of the election, the Trump administration cut $160m in direct funding to Afghan authorities, citing corruption.\n\nIf no candidate obtains over 50 precent in the results, a second round of voting will be held.", "description": "Polls took place in September but election commission says 'cannot accept sacrificing transparency for speed'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/27/4f3cc53c7b704980ba0df16c3c695b00_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
