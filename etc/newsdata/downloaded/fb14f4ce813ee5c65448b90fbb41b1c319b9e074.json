TRY! Nicky Smith burrows over! Another penalty was coming for offside, and probably a yellow card, too, but Wales show patience and do not force the play with the advantage, and after Ryan Elias went close his front-row cohort Nicky Smith digs his way through with support from a latching Josh Adams, who lends his weight to give the loosehead the final push to the whitewash. Over goes the conversion. Wales 7-0 Uruguay 15 minutes The ball squirts from the back of the scrum, and Aaron Wainwright is forced to go back five metres before eventually carrying forward. Again Wales go with the forwards close-in, and this time they find some joy with the tighter forays. 14 minutes Hadleigh Parkes and Owen Watkin are both well-stopped as each comes on a overs line, crash balls effectively stopped, but Uruguay illegally forage for the ball at the breakdown and Angus Gardner is going to have a chat with Juan Manuel Gaminara... Just a talking to, oddly. That's four penalties right by the try line. Gaminara is given time to pass on the warning to his team, giving his forwards a vital break before another Welsh scrum. 13 minutes Excellent fringe defence from Uruguay, repelling all of Wales' attempted one-out charges and pick-and-drives, but they again infringed at the lineout, taking out a lifter. Wales this time opt for a scrum, and stabler set piece ball with which they can launch something from the back. Angus Gardner might just be getting impatient with the penalty count. Advertisement 12 minutes Uruguay defend the maul well, forcing the ball to squirm free, but only via an illegal entry at the side from moustachioed, mulleted menace German Kessler. Another Welsh penalty. NO TRY! Superb last-ditch tackle from Nicolas Freitas! Freitas has done brilliantly to get at the legs of the much bigger man, with Shingler forced into touch by a perfect low cover tackle as he looks to dive over. Wales have the penalty, though, for offside. Back into the corner they go. 11 minutes TRY? What an offload from Aled Davies! Aaron Shingler might be in! Delightful pass from the scrum-half, and a leaping Shingler might just have got this down in the corner. 9 minutes The Welsh midfield defence has looked rather malleable so far, with another Andres Vilaseca charge putting Rhys Patchell in reverse gear. Justin Tipuric has perhaps been a touch slow off the side of the scrum, and Vilaseca is rather enjoying the soft shoulders that Patchell is offering him. Uruguay throw a forward pass to end a forward movement of some promise, with Felipe Berchesi trying to be too clever to put his man through a gap. Wales win a scrum penalty, and Patchell sticks the kick from the Uruguay ten-metre inside the South Americans' 22. Advertisement 7 minutes There is plenty of ambition from Wales, and plenty of space for them to explore, too, but so far their accuracy has been largely poor. Another fumble down the left leaves Leigh Halfpenny disappointed with open grass ahead of him. The ball bounces his way after being knocked forward. 5 minutes Dropped over the line! Aaron Wainwright has shelled it! Lovely play from Wales to capitalise on a gap, and the ball is popped up for the Welsh number eight he seems set to score, but a third early Welsh handling error means he does not. That's not the first butchering we've seen at this tournament... 4 minutes Another mighty run from Andres Vilaseca, uncomplicated stuff from Uruguay but again effective in bishing and boshing their way over the gainline, and further too. But Wales pounce on an under-resourced breakdown, and look to counter attack. Uruguay defend their initial efforts well, but Justin Tipuric lurks in space on the blindside and Aled Davies feeds him, Tipuric's athleticism on full display as he wriggles out of a tackle and races away on the outside. Back inside to Davies, and from the next phase the ball is whipped wide... Advertisement 2 minutes A strong charge from the first phase from the scrum from hard-running inside centre Andres Vilaseca, and that allows Uruguay to clear. Leigh Halfpenny takes the ball down well in the air. Wales look to play, and again find open water down the left, with a lock again the man to discover it, Bradley Davies hoisting his big thighs high and stepping, ball in one hand, inside a tackler. Davies makes 15 metres but has the ball knocked from his grasp as he looks to offload. 1 minute Wales into their work early on, and finding immediate space, wide on the left with the long-striding lock Adam Beard feigning a kick to open space. He shows lovely sleight of hand to pop the ball up for Hallam Amos cutting a line back inside, and Amos is away, but can't gather the ball cleanly, juggling and eventually fumbling to knock-on. KICK OFF Rhys Patchell kicks high into the Kumamoto sky and the penultimate pool game of the 2019 Rugby World Cup is underway. The \"Himno Nacional de Uruguay\" is passionately belted out by the Uruguayan squad, as it has been throughout the tournament. There are unsurprisingly plenty more Welsh fans to rise to their feet and help the Wales squad sing \"\"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\", and they do, with Kumamoto in fine voice. Advertisement Before the anthems, we pause for a minute of reflection and remembrance for the impact of Typhoon Hagibis, which killed 18 people yesterday. Impeccably observed. Out of the tunnel come the two sides, two flankers leading the lines, with Justin Tipuric captaining his side for the first time, and Juan Manuel Gaminara proudly striding out at the head of the Uruguay squad. Angus Gardner of Australia is our referee, while Rowan Kitt is the TMO. Rhys Patchell starts for Wales at fly-half today, with Dan Biggar taking a sickening contact to the head in the win over Fiji, Biggar's skull taking three heavy impacts in quick succession as he collided with a team mate in the air. That means the Northampton Saints playmaker is a doubt for the quarter-final, and with concussion such a difficult issue to deal with and forecast, it may well be Patchell at ten for Wales against France or England. Warren Gatland will thus be hoping his back-up, who has had a couple of enterprising cameos so far at the tournament, can further embed himself in the action today ahead of the quarter-final. I wonder if he might just be hauled off a little early to protect him, too. We are told that Hallam Amos is the fly-half cover, by the way, but Hadleigh Parkes has played there for the Scarlets, too. We did lose one game this morning, however, if you are wondering what happened to Namibia-Canada...
