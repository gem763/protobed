His teammates are starting his Norris Trophy campaign.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cIt seems like anything he wants, it goes in \u2014 passes, shots, plays \u2014 and it is good for us,\u201d Ovechkin said.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, Carlson leads the league in points with 20 (five goals, 15 assists), after scoring two goals Tuesday against the Flames.\n\nAD\n\nThe 29-year-old extended his point streak to eight games, matching his career high. He became the fourth defenseman in NHL history to record 20-plus points in October and is the second-fastest defenseman to 20 since Paul Coffey did it in 10 games in 1988-89. Carlson is the third defenseman in history to lead the league in scoring through the first 20 days of the season (Baldy Northcott: 1932-33; Bobby Orr: 1969-70 and 1974-75).\n\nAD\n\nAsked how it felt to be in the company of players like Orr and Coffey, Carlson responded, \u201cYeah, that they are a lot better players than me. But it\u2019s pretty cool, obviously great players in that list, and you know I\u2019m just happy to be among them.\u201d\n\nCarlson insists some of his points were \u201clucky,\u201d repeatedly calling scoring for defensemen \u201cstreaky\u201d and he just needs to \u201ctake it when he can get it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCarlson\u2019s first goal Tuesday was a hopeful shot that seemed to catch Calgary goaltender Cam Talbot by surprise as it hit the short side for the goal. His empty-netter late in the game was a bouncer that found the net.\n\nAnd while any player needs a couple bounces to go his way during the season, goaltender Braden Holtby said Carlson\u2019s overall game Tuesday, especially in the defensive zone alongside Michal Kempny, was \u201cphenomenal.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCapitals Coach Todd Reirden said Carlson continues to earn all the praise and talk over the first three weeks of the season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s our main guy back there, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Reirden said.\n\nOver the past two seasons, Carlson has been in the Norris discussion, finishing in the top five in voting both years, but never among the top three. Last year, in a season in which he earned an all-star nod for the first time in his career, Carlson was fourth after tallying 70 points (13 goals, 57 assists). The year prior, Carlson finished fifth, after leading all defensemen with 68 points.\n\nAD\n\nBut as Carlson chooses to remain humble, his teammates will gladly do the talking for him. Ovechkin will always be one of the first to promote Carlson, as will Nicklas Backstrom, who over the last few years, has been outspoken about Carlson not getting enough recognition around the league.\n\nAD\n\nCarlson also was chosen as an alternate captain this season, taking over a role played by Brooks Orpik last season. This season, Carlson is being relied on more than ever before to be the leader on the blue line and so far, he\u2019s done that and more.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a terrific player first of all and to see him dominant the way he does it is pretty incredible,\u201d Backstrom said. \u201cHe is not really chasing points either. He is a really good defenseman, plays really solid back there. Points are just going his way, I think, and I\u2019m happy for him.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCarlson is impressing his opponents too. Calgary captain Mark Giordano said he equates Carlson to a high-powered forward, having to account for him on the ice at all times and making sure to take away time and space.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen some pretty hot starts, but I\u2019ve never seen something like this,\u201d Giordano said. \u201cReally impressive. He\u2019s always been a guy that puts up numbers and he is right up there offensively year in and year out.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCarlson\u2019s play has been crucial to the Capitals\u2019 recent success. Washington is on a four-game win streak after winning the first two games of a,five-game trip that continues Thursday against Edmonton.\n\n\u201cI think he took a step forward obviously in his game and his confidence is really high,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I said, \u2018Johnny for Norris!\u2019\u201d\n\nMore on the Capitals:\n\nAD", "description": "As of Wednesday morning, Carlson leads the league in points with 20 (five goals, 15 assists), after scoring two goals Tuesday against Calgary.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YyzwaEyCP3d-sL_lW49zEJDYZv0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E6NUEYXK2YI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
