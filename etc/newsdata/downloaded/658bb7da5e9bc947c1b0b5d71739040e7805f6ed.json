Join the conversation below.\n\nIt expects growth to remain low in 2020 and possibly beyond if the trade conflict between the U.S. and China spills over into other aspects of their economic relationship. The OECD noted that the affiliates of U.S. companies operating in China have sales that exceed total U.S. exports to China.\n\nLike other international financial institutions, the OECD has long backed free trade and a more open global economy as a path to prosperity.\n\n\u201cOur main worry is that this sliding of growth is becoming entrenched,\u201d said Laurence Boone, the OECD\u2019s chief economist.\n\nAnother worry for Ms. Boone is that trade disputes could proliferate, with Japan and South Korea already in conflict and U.S. President Donald Trump due to decide in November whether to press ahead with tariffs on automobile imports that would hit the European Union.\n\nThe OECD cut its growth forecasts for the U.S. and a number of developing economies. It now expects U.S. gross domestic product to increase by 2.4% this year and 2% the next year, having forecast growth of 2.8% and 2.3% in May. It made an even larger cut to its 2019 growth projections for Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.\n\nThe U.S.-China dispute isn\u2019t the only cloud on the OECD\u2019s horizon, even if it is the largest and darkest. The research body also warned that should the U.K. leave the European Union without a new trade deal, economic output could be 2% lower than would otherwise be the case in the U.K., and 0.5% lower in the EU. That would leave the U.K. in recession, and the EU on the brink.\n\nThe U.K. has already delayed its departure from the EU once and may do so again as an Oct. 31 deadline nears.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s adding to this uncertainty that\u2019s prevailing everywhere,\u201d said Ms. Boone in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.\n\nSlowing trade flows and business investment are the most obvious signs that trade disputes are taking a toll on global growth. The OECD said that across the Group of 20 leading economies, investment spending rose at an annual rate of just 1% in the first half of this year, compared with 5% at the start of 2018, when the U.S. first raised tariffs.\n\nThe trade war with China is putting a strain on the U.S. agriculture industry. WSJ's Jason Bellini sat down with a group of farmers from the corn, beef, soybean, and dairy industries to hear how tariffs are affecting their businesses.\n\nThus far, the jobs market has held up well in most developed economies, but the OECD said that support to growth may also be under threat.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have this kind of slowdown without some impact on jobs at some stage,\u201d said Ms. Boone.\n\nOver recent years, more voters in many countries have rejected the free-trade path advocated by the OECD, sending globalization into retreat.\n\nMs. Boone thinks they may have second thoughts as the costs of that reversal become more apparent.\n\n\u201cThe appetite for destruction looks like it\u2019s growing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the impact hasn\u2019t been palpable for people. When they see firms going bankrupt, jobs being lost, people may question this move.\u201d\n\nWrite to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com", "description": "The global economy is set to grow at the slowest pace since the financial crisis, with business investment and trade hampered by an escalating dispute between the U.S. and China, the OECD said.", "authors": ["Paul Hannon", "Paul.Hannon Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108609/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
