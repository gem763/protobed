(Picture: ITV)\n\nVinnie Jones has set his sights on a spot on the Britain\u2019s Got Talent judging panel to honour his late wife Tanya.\n\nThe 54-year-old actor and former footballer sadly lost his wife of 25 years in July after a six year long battle with cancer and has been competing on The X Factor: Celebrity in her honour.\n\nBut looking to the future, Vinnie revealed that while he\u2019s loving competing in the singing competition, he really wants to have a go at judging too.\n\n\u2018Tanya was always a good judge. She would always have her favourite,\u2019 Vinnie told the Daily Star.\n\n\u2018I might be a contestant now, but I would also love to be considered to be a judge somewhere on one of Simon [Cowell\u2019s] shows.\n\n\u2018Either Britain\u2019s Got Talent or America\u2019s Got Talent because there is so much variety.\u2019\n\nVinnie\u2019s impressed X Factor fans with his charm and vocal ability (Picture: Rex)\n\nIn the father-of-two\u2019s opinion, Simon\u2019s talent juggernaut is missing a straight-talking, no-nonsense judge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnsurprisingly, Vinnie thinks he can fill that position.\n\n\u2018Piers Morgan did a great job because he told it how it was,\u2019 he continued, \u2018Simon used to but he\u2019s gone soft in his old age and especially as there\u2019s no Piers.\n\n\u2018And Mel B\u2026 she\u2019d say it how it was on America\u2019s Got Talent. She\u2019s gone from that show now, too.\n\n\u2018So the Vinster is waiting. The Vinster is there for either show.\u2019\n\nSpeak it into existence, eh Vinnie?\n\nHowever, while the former professional footballer isn\u2019t a huge fan of his X Factor: Celebrity co-star Simon\u2019s judging style, Vinnie admitted that Tanya had always had a soft spot for the TV mogul.\n\n\u2018In the early days, I would give Simon a bit of stick and Tanya would stick up for him,\u2019 he said. \u2018She loved him.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
