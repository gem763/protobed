But choosing a gift for them can be quite overwhelming as there are so many to pick from.\n\nIn our search for the perfect present, we\u2019ve found toys, gifts and games at a range of prices that will appeal to most children, but have deliberately steered clear of any excessively on-trend toys, instead aiming for products with longevity.\n\nThe overall aim has been to include things that encourage fun \u2013 and if a little learning happens along the way, that can only be a good thing.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice.

Embellished with lots of glitter and sparkle, it\u2019s perfect for letting little imaginations run wild. All the details feel of great quality, from the Velcro fastened tulle and cotton cape to the leatherette eye mask and wrist cuffs lined with soft felt. It\u2019s tough to choose from the whole range of Meri Meri\u2019s dress up sets \u2013 the dragon one is also gorgeous, as are the accessories such as the magic wands and pom pom crowns, but the superhero set gets our vote for combination of price, quality, longevity and versatility.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nLearning Resources coding critters rumble & bumble: \u00a340, Learning Resources\n\nThis new set from Learning Resources, the company that makes educational toys that kids actually want to play with, is brilliant. Introducing early science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) concepts, \u201ccoding critters\u201d encourages kids to get their heads round basic coding without the use of screens. The dinosaur is a pet that needs looking after, and by using the props and story book included, children can programme it to complete different challenges. It\u2019s a set to really get stuck into and there\u2019s hours of entertainment to be had directing the dinosaur around his little home. Despite being aimed at kids aged four and above, it requires a bit of patience to get to grips with, but is definitely worth it once they get the hang of it.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nDjeco flower fairy face painting: \u00a314.25, Crafts 4 Kids\n\n\n\nWe love Djeco\u2019s range of beautiful toys and crafts, and this face painting set is perfect for anyone with limited art skills. Admittedly, it\u2019s an expensive way to buy face paints, but the set comes with reusable stencils, three pots of paint, two sponges, a brush and two sets of face stickers, which, by following the detailed instructions, allowed us to create child-pleasing designs (instead of our go-to basic rainbow). The decorative stickers attach to the skin well and, with care, can be reused a few times. Other sets are available, including pirate, superhero and butterfly options.\n\nBuy now\n\nLearning Resources geosafari jr. kidnoculars: \u00a312, Learning Resources\n\nSo straightforward to use, these binoculars designed for small hands brought our tester so much joy. No adjusting or focusing is needed \u2013 they provide simple 2x magnification from the get go and easily sit in the right place on the face, thanks to the softly moulded eye piece. Light to wear around the neck, these have become a regular fixture on trips to the park with our little tester.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nJujuni dungarees: \u00a338, Jujuni\n\nAn adorable gift for boys or girls, these organic cotton dungarees from Jujuni are available in a range of crowd pleasing colours. They are robust enough to survive much rough and tumble yet are also oh-so-soft. These dungarees are designed to last \u2013 turn ups and adjustable straps mean they can cope with a growth spurt or two, and are hardwearing enough to be passed on to younger siblings too. Cute T-shirts in colour-coordinating prints are also available.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nLakeland kids\u2019 real cookware ultimate 48-piece baking gift set: \u00a329.99, Lakeland\n\nA fantastic set for any budding bakers, the rolling pin, spatula, brush and whisk, as well as piping bag, measuring spoons and biscuit cutters, are really nicely proportioned for small hands. We were initially a bit baffled as to why the tart tin and loaf tin are so small, but we tweaked our recipes to make sure both mum and little tester could cook tarts, large and small.\n\nWe could have done with a few more mini fairy cake cases too, as there are only six along with the tin. But our little tester is very proud of her baking kit and she\u2019s loving getting to grips with all the different tools.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nLego city sky police jet patrol: \u00a37.99, Lego\n\nWhat roundup of gifts would be complete without something from Lego? This set from its city range for 4+ is a great stepping-stone from Duplo to Lego as it has several pre-constructed pieces. Not only is building the set absorbing, once built, our tester loved playing with the figures and imagining stories for the plane and jewel safe. It\u2019s fantastic value, too.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nScalextric Wacky Races micro set: \u00a354.99, Scalextric\n\nA huge hit with our testers of every age, this micro set has given hours of entertainment. Four-year-olds will need help assembling it, but our grown up testers were more than happy to help (some of the track is a bit stiff to fit together and needs some brute force). The stunt loop is a fun addition, and we love that it can be used as a vertical stunt ramp to run up the wall too.\n\nThe hand controllers in the micro sets are a great size for small hands and have speed limiters with four settings \u2013 it\u2019s worth limiting the power to 25 per cent when starting out to get the hang of things.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nOrchard Toys knights and dragons: \u00a38, Orchard Toys\n\nOne of the new editions from the ever-reliable Orchard Toys, this colour matching game is easy to get the hang of but provides plenty of engagement and aspects to talk about. It\u2019s handy for travelling with and has enough elements that it doesn\u2019t get too boring for parents if played on repeat.\n\nBuy now\n\nRockahula wish upon a star bag: \u00a314, Rockahula Kids\n\nThis Rockahula velvet handbag straddles the cute/grown up divide perfectly \u2013 not too twee that it\u2019s babyish, its cool design will appeal to older kids too. The ribbon streaming from the star is a nice 3D touch and it\u2019s a great size for four-year-olds. The strap isn\u2019t adjustable but it does have a press-stud fixing for safety. It has a hang of 45cm, is lined inside and closes with a zip. It\u2019s also available in dark blue.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nSmart Games Camelot Jr: \u00a319.99, Smart Games\n\nThe concept is deceptively simple \u2013 reunite the knight with the princess by helping the princess build a rescue route, or the knight build a bridge \u2013 but with 48 different challenges increasing in difficulty, us grown up testers loved this taxing game nearly as much as our little testers did. The instructions are clear, solutions are provided to each challenge, and the wooden pieces are nice and chunky, it\u2019d just be better if it came with a small bag or box to keep the pieces in. We love that this encourages a child\u2019s logical thinking and problem solving without them realising it.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nThe Little Green Sheep kids teepee play tent, linen: \u00a389.95, The Little Green Sheep\n\nVery large and beautifully made, the canvas cotton and untreated wood poles give this teepee a really pleasing tactile finish and it makes a brilliant den. If you\u2019re short on space, it can easily be collapsed and tucked away in a corner of a room when not in use. We were initially flummoxed as to how to tie the teepee to the poles \u2013 the directions could be clearer \u2013 but by closely lining up the poles and threading the canvas tie through, it became easy to secure.\n\nOur little tester is a bit disappointed the wigwam doesn\u2019t fully close; instead the doors can be tied back, but loves the space inside \u2013 at least three little pals can comfortably fit in, and god knows what they get up to in there! The matching play mat is an additional extra. It\u2019s also available in pale grey.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nUsborne 100 things for little children to do on a train: \u00a36.99, Usborne\n\nThis little box of 50 double sided wipe-clean cards has been a lifesaver on many a long journey, and the variety of activities included is so great we always seem to come across a card we haven\u2019t seen before. The pen included could be a little chunkier for smaller hands, but is good practice for using grown up ones. Easily wiped clean with a dry tissue, this box of goodies is light, small and a great price.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Gifts for four-year-olds\n\nFor sheer utter adorableness, the Meri Meri superhero dress up set gets our vote for best \u2013 it\u2019s quickly become a favourite and is played with, in different ways, most days. For cheaper alternatives, the geosafari kidnoculars and the Lego city set have both proved to have great pay per play value.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
