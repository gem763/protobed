Hamilton all but sealed his sixth world championship at the Mexican Grand Prix on Sunday but his win was secured only after an on-track clash with Verstappen, which he described as being \u201ctorpedoed\u201d. The Briton should take the title at the next round in Austin.\n\nLewis Hamilton claims Mexico Grand Prix but has to wait for title Read more\n\nHamilton won at the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez after starting from third on the grid with a superb performance that was very much against the odds. Mercedes had been beaten for pace by Ferrari and Red Bull over the weekend but on race day they executed a superb strategy. Sending Hamilton into the pits early to take a one-stop on the hard tyre put him in the lead over Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel. He had track position but needed to make his tyres last for 47 laps. He did so with an outstanding display of controlled precision driving.\n\nHowever, the world champion\u2019s race almost ended in the first corners of the opening lap. Verstappen had started from fourth and was alongside Hamilton as they entered the first corner. With little space to manoeuvre the pair went wheel to wheel through turn two, touched one another and were forced across the grass. Hamilton took damage to his rear floor, costing him stability and consequently forcing him to adapt his driving style.\n\n\u201cObviously got torpedoed,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought at some stage I\u2019d get torpedoed by Max. I braked into turn one and all of a sudden Max is alongside me. If you have seen my previous races, I always leave Max a lot of space because it is the smartest thing you can do.\u201d\n\nF1: Lewis Hamilton wins Mexico Grand Prix - as it happened! Read more\n\nHamilton had been critical of Verstappen after he failed to slow under yellow flags during qualifying, for which he was demoted from pole position. Hamilton described it as \u201ccareless and not abiding by the rules\u201d.\n\nAfter the race he went further in suggesting that clashes with Verstappen were almost inevitable unless he was given a wide berth. \u201cEvery driver is slightly different. Some are very smart and aggressive, and some are silly with it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo through those experiences you give some more space, and with others you don\u2019t have to because they are quite respectful. But with Max it is very likely you are going to come together with him if you don\u2019t give him the extra space.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was intentional what happened on the first lap, but he\u2019s a magnet for those kind of things.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sparks fly as Max Verstappen (right) overtakes Lewis Hamilton (left) in Sao Paulo. Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty Images\n\nVettel, who has also had several run-ins with Verstappen, gave an acerbic but amusing answer when asked his opinion. Referring to Hamilton\u2019s comments he said: \u201cJust copy and paste. It\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nVerstappen has exhibited a more controlled, mature driving style this year after receiving criticism for some of his more reckless manoeuvres in previous seasons. He did go on to put in an impressive comeback drive. Having taken a puncture when he was clipped by Valtteri Bottas that dropped the Dutchman to last, he came through the field to finish sixth, a remarkable stint of 66 laps on the same tyre.\n\nFormula One now heads to Austin for the US GP this weekend. Hamilton leads Bottas by 74 points with 78 available. A finish of eighth or higher in Texas will be enough for the title.\n\nMercedes will expect to be strong once more in the US as will Hamilton, who has won four of the past five meetings. He was anticipating a strong conclusion to his campaign there, where he is perhaps the most well-known and visible of all the F1 drivers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely becoming more and more known in the States,\u201d he said. \u201cI think my story and my family\u2019s story is something that a lot of people in different countries can relate to. America\u2019s always a cool place to live. They do it their own way.\n\n\u201cThe track is fantastic and it\u2019s been a good hunting ground for me, so very excited to go there and who knows whether we can get the job done. We\u2019ll hopefully have a good race there.\u201d", "description": "Lewis Hamilton has said Max Verstappen\u2019s driving style makes him a magnet for clashes", "authors": ["Giles Richards"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b8d5faa1d1b5772b7d8d519822c730ce22f3589/0_65_3188_1913/master/3188.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=44356440d3cefcebb93353e33b2498fb", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
