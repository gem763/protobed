Serious breaches of the new mandatory code, including major injury of death, will result in fines of up to NZ$100,000.\n\nNew Zealand hall of residence 'pursued family for cash' as student lay dead for weeks Read more\n\nThe swift changes come after the body of 19-year-old e-commerce student Pendrous was found on 23 September in his dorm room at Canterbury university, Christchurch.\n\nPendrous had been dead for at least a month, New Zealand police said, and his father has expressed anguish that his son\u2019s absence was not noted from university classes, tutorials or meals.\n\nIt is still unclear how Pendrous died, and the coroner is investigating.\n\nFirst-year university students usually live in campus accomodation, often away from home for the first time. Most halls of residence charge between NZ$15,000 and NZ$20,000 per year.\n\nAt present, the code of practice is voluntary for university halls of residence, but Hipkins said the self-regulation approach had failed. \u201cThere is no consistent approach to the welfare and pastoral care of domestic tertiary students and we needed to change that swiftly,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new code of practice will come into effect in 2021, while the new offence and financial penalties will apply from January next year.\n\nEarlier this month an Otago University student died when she was trampled to death while attending an end-of semester party in Dunedin. A number of other students were seriously injured, and student binge-drinking culture has been raised as a contributing factor to the tragedy.\n\n", "description": "Education minister says case of Mason Pendrous \u2018exposed the limitations\u2019 of pastoral care system", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5af8b0630b6041d1a73362de5266159ed6b6e78/0_159_5311_3188/master/5311.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=691a89690c138c6b7e80befbfc8d6711", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
