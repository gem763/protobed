Ninety minutes later Mya-Lecia was pronounced dead at Croydon University hospital.\n\nMya-Lecia, who at the age of nine played Miro in the film adaptation of David Mitchell\u2019s science-fiction epic Cloud Atlas, was due to sit her GCSEs this summer.\n\nShe was described by the BBC as a \u201chuge talent\u201d after starring in a number of CBBC shows including Millie Inbetween and Almost Never. Her first role was an appearance as a toddler in the sitcom Absolutely Fabulous. More recently she was a member of the band Angels N\u2019 Bandits.\n\nBefore she died her parents had been told by her school that her grades were lower than expected.\n\nHer father, Martin Naylor, told South London coroner\u2019s court: \u201cShe had not been her normal self \u2026 she was stressed about her exams. She knew she needed to get on with her revision and she had plans scheduled out for her revision.\u201d\n\nMya-Lecia\u2019s parents had told her to try her best and not get overly worried about her exams. At the time of her death they believed the issues had been tackled, they told the inquest.\n\nThe inquest heard that just before her death Mya-Lecia had been banned from attending a party, and she had spent the previous night watching a film with her family that included a scene of suicide.\n\nHer father, who saw the teenager on the morning of her death, said: \u201cI genuinely believe she did not mean to do it \u2026 She clearly had plans for the future.\u201d\n\nThe assistant coroner, Toby Watkin, concluded that the teenager did not intend to end her own life and that her death was by misadventure.\n\nA toxicology report found no evidence of drugs or alcohol in Mya-Lecia\u2019s body, and searches of her phones, laptop and social media accounts did not present anything suspicious.\n\nAt the time of Mya-Lecia\u2019s death, Alice Webb, the director of BBC Children\u2019s, said the team were \u201cdistraught and so terribly sad\u201d. She said: \u201cShe was so hugely popular with our audience.\u201d\n\nCBBC said Mya-Lecia was a \u201cmuch-loved part of the BBC Children\u2019s family and a hugely talented actress, singer and dancer\u201d.\n\n\u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.
