I am 26 years old and live in Lees Summit, Missouri. I am the mortgage operations assistant at a local Credit Union. I finally found a weight-loss strategy that works for me and dropped over 100 pounds in a year.\n\nI had been overweight ever since I was a little girl. I was badly bullied for it all through school. My weight made me shy and prevented me from making friends. I lacked confidence and self-esteem.\n\nAfter graduating high school, I tried multiple methods to lose weight. I counted calories, I worked out, and at one point I was even on a prescription weight-loss pill from my doctor. It was frustrating and sank me deep into depression. I was also in an abusive relationship from the ages of 18 to 21. After that relationship ended badly, I felt even more lost than ever, and the weight seemed to pile on even more. Before I knew it, I was at my heaviest: 236 pounds.\n\nMy turning point came two years ago, when my new boyfriend (and now fianc\u00e9!) and I went on a short hike.\n\nIt was only two miles long, but I could barely keep up even a mile in. My feet hurt, my knees ached, and I was struggling to breathe. It was embarrassing, and I was so ashamed of myself. Something had to change.\n\nThat\u2019s when I sought out more info about intermittent fasting.\n\nMy boyfriend was doing the 16:8 method for his own health reasons, and we had briefly talked about it. I was skeptical at first. But after finding an inspiring first-person article by someone who had success using intermittent fasting, I figured maybe it might work for me.\n\nThe woman whose article interested me followed the 4:3 method of alternate-day fasting, where she fasts for three days and eats for four, along with counting calories. It was then (on September 5th, 2017) that I decided while munching on a snack of mixed nuts that I would commit to IF.\n\nI decided to start my own method of complete intermittent, alternate-day fasting (ADF), where I would go every other day (or 36 to 40 hours) without eating, also counting my calories as I went.\n\nWhen I first started ADF I calculated what my calorie needs would be for my body using a total daily energy expenditure calculator. During my first week of fasting, I allowed myself up to 500 calories on my fasting day to wean myself into going 40 hours without food. In reality, I didn\u2019t change much of what I was eating, besides just watching the number calories I was taking in. The second week of fasting, I was able to go the whole fasting day without intaking any calories. Intermittent fasting was a *lot* easier than I thought it would be.\n\nOnce I got used to this eating schedule, I started swapping out less nutritious meals for healthier options.\n\nFor example, I changed little things, like my 2 percent milk to almond milk, or started measuring out my pasta per serving instead of just using the whole box. The small changes can really add up to a whole lot of success. Within my first month of ADF I lost 16 pounds. I was elated that I had finally found something that worked for me.\n\nHere\u2019s what I typically eat in a day now:\n\nBreakfast: Overnight oats or banana oatmeal\n\nLunch: Cauliflower rice with lemon pepper shrimp or braised beef, or spinach with a sweet potato, hard boiled egg and salsa\n\nSnacks: Mixed nuts, or a protein bar, or I also make my own tortilla chips with high-fiber, low-carb Xtreme Wellness tortillas\n\nDinner: Two-ingredient dough pizzas or baked chicken with veggies\n\nDessert: Breyers Low-Carb Vanilla Ice Cream with cookie butter mixed in, or frozen fruit blended in a food processor (healthy sorbet!)\n\nAfter seven months of intermittent fasting and down 62 pounds, I decided that I wanted to start adding physical activity into my life.\n\nBefore intermittent fasting, I never worked out. Now that I had lost some weight, I didn\u2019t feel as heavy and thought I would actually be able to really push myself and help my body grow even stronger and healthier. I started using a couch-to-5k running app and took my time, not exactly following the program, but it helped tremendously. I went from hardly being able to jog for two minutes, to running for 20 to 28 minutes without stopping.\n\n\n\nEventually, after a year of ADF, running every eat day, and losing 98 pounds, I also introduced weight lifting into my life with the help of my boyfriend. I worked my way up to my current exercise routine. I run on every fasting day and try to walk two miles on my breaks at work. I lift on the days I am not fasting. I\u2019ve found this is the perfect balance for me.", "description": "\"Intermittent fasting was a *lot* easier than I thought it would be.\"", "authors": ["Rachel Sharp", "As Told To Emily Shiffer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xZsTyH5DEym8TFOz9pLm4w--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_womens_health_52/83f4a97f852c19a240fc129f835c762c", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
