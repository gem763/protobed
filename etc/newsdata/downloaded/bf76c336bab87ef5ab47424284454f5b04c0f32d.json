I condemn that statement,\u201d Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) told VICE News Tuesday morning. \u201cThe historical reference is very problematic and it's just wrong.\u201d\n\nRead: The Impeachment Investigation Might Get Its Most Damning Testimony on Tuesday\n\nStefanik made those comments as she left the GOP\u2019s weekly press conference, where as a member of the House Intelligence Committee she lambasted Democrats for what she described as a secretive and unfair House impeachment process.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) was even more frustrated with Trump\u2019s comments, tweeting that the president should \u201cretract\u201d his racially loaded comments immediately.\n\nThe handful of Republicans who\u2019ve shown some independence from the president were harsher with their descriptions.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who\u2019s facing a tough reelection fight, said Trump should \u201cretract\u201d the statement.\n\n\"Lynching brings back terrible images of a dark chapter in our nation's history, and the president never should have made that comparison,\u201d she told VICE News.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), said she hadn\u2019t seen the tweet but called the remark \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\n\nEven Trump\u2019s own spokesman struggled to reframe his remarks.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s not comparing what\u2019s happened to him to one of the country\u2019s darkest moments,\u201d White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters.\n\nRepublicans have been down this road before, condemning Trump\u2019s rhetoric even as they refuse to stand up to his controversial actions. But there seems to be a growing weariness among some lawmakers who are sick of having to defend the president amid the impeachment inquiry and his controversial decision to abandon the Kurds in Syria.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), whose entire Tuesday morning press conference (and much of his leadership) was aimed at defending Trump, wasn\u2019t thrilled with the remarks.\n\n\"That's not the language I would use,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nMcCarthy declined to explain why he took issue with Trump\u2019s language, however.\n\n\"I don't agree with that language. Pretty simple,\u201d he said when VICE News asked why he wouldn\u2019t use that language, before ignoring a follow-up question.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also expressed discomfort with the president's language.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a Trump defender facing a potentially tough reelection, offered similar remarks.\n\n\u201cI get his frustration. But I probably wouldn't have used that language,\u201d she told VICE News. \"I just wouldn't use it.\"\n\nYet their concern wasn\u2019t shared by everyone in the party. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of Trump\u2019s most ardent backers, forcefully defended the president, calling the impeachment inquiry \u201ca lynching in every sense.\u201d\n\n\n\nCover: President Donald Trump gestures while speakings during a Cabinet meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Monday, Oct. 21, 2019, in Washington.
