In one, he can be seen punching a man in the head several times while pinning him on the ground.\n\n\"He won't fight again, that's it,\" White, the UFC president, told ESPN on Thursday. \"That's a wrap. It's not even that this was the last straw. I didn't love him continuing to fight anyway, but with the relationship that he and I have \u2014 he gets me on the phone, begging me for another fight. It's hard to turn him down.\n\n\"After what I saw in that video, BJ needs to, you know, he needs to focus on his personal life before he thinks about fighting.\"\n\nPenn (16-14-2) had been touted to fight Nik Lentz later this year in what would have been his 29th fight in the Octagon.\n\nRead more: An enraged pub owner filmed himself pouring Conor McGregor's whiskey down the toilet, saying McGregor is 'not a true representative of the Irish people'\n\nThe street fight was said to have occurred at the Lava Shack bar. A person close to Penn told TMZ that a man was following Penn around \"and trying to bait him into a fight.\"\n\nIn one of the videos, Penn can be seen exchanging words with a topless man and then being knocked to the ground. In the other, apparently recorded after the first, Penn can be seen wrestling the man to the ground and repeatedly punching him in the head.\n\nThe videos were the latest leaked by TMZ showing UFC stars involved in violence outside the Octagon.\n\nLast month, TMZ released CCTV footage appearing to show Conor McGregor punching an older man in the face in a Dublin pub earlier this year. The Irish fighter has since apologized.\n\nAnd earlier this week, TMZ published a video of Melvin Guillard, a former UFC fighter, knocking a man out while working as a bouncer at a bar in Denver last year.", "description": "Dana White told ESPN that BJ Penn wouldn't fight in the UFC again after footage of Penn's involvement in a street brawl in Hawaii emerged last week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d710f0e2e22af53fd348193-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
