Paired with his older sibling in the centre of midfield, he added the energy and enthusiasm so lacking of late among his elder team-mates.\n\nEven his brother was inspired after a difficult season to date and the Geordie duo out-fought and out-thought an opposition midfield of Fred and Scott McTominay.\n\nThe midfielder celebrates his winning goal on Tyneside in front of a 51,198 crowd\n\nBruce risked upsetting his players by making public his concerns about their ability to attack before the game, but there was certainly no sulking here.\n\nThe inclusion of debutant Longstaff helped ensure that, for no academy graduate on the biggest day of his career is going to give anything less than 100 per cent.\n\nThat may sound like a simple requirement, but Newcastle\u2019s effort levels at Leicester were some way below that mark.\n\nMatty Longstaff added graft and craft to the side and capped what was already a man-of-the-match display by drilling home the game\u2019s only goal on 72 minutes.\n\nMatthew hits the crossbar during the first half at St James' Park with brother Sean watching on\n\nEven in stoppage-time he had the awareness and maturity to hook one ball from danger and turn it into a defence-splitting pass for a team-mate to chase.\n\nThere was no hint of him tiring, either, as would have been forgiven on what should have been such a draining experience.\n\nHis smile was as wide as the Tyne on full-time, a grin rivalled by that of his brother.\n\nThe pair of them would have dreamt of such an outcome after learning they would be playing together on Saturday.\n\nAnd so would Bruce. He needed this.", "description": "CRAIG HOPE AT ST JAMES' PARK: Manchester United were courting Newcastle's Sean Longstaff in the summer, but they will be adding the name of brother Matty to their shortlist.", "authors": ["Craig Hope For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/19/19366206-0-image-a-13_1570386642399.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
