Our research uncovers what is possibly only a fraction of the questionable grants involving Lottery money.\n\nOver the next week, we will publish stories describing how companies linked to Phillemon Letwaba, the NLC\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO), are involved in Lottery deals with tens of millions of rands.\n\nThis follows our publication of previous stories exposing corruption and incompetence involving NLC projects.\n\nLetwaba\u2019s brother was implicated in one such project.\n\nSeveral strategies underpin these projects:\n\nFirst, money is directed to them making use of a 2015 amendment to the Lotteries Act that allows the Minister of Trade and Industry, the NLC or its board to identify projects to be funded without receiving applications. This is known as proactive funding. The problem with proactive funding is that there is often no rigorous prior scrutiny of the projects awarded money by NLC officials.\n\nSecond, the projects are often based in towns far from large cities, where reporters are less likely to venture.\n\nThird, the appointment of service providers for multimillion-rand construction projects, like construction and engineering companies, is left to the recipients of the funding.\n\nIn contrast to government departments, these projects often do not have transparent tender processes. The NLC\u2019s own audits seldom check for conflicts of interest on the projects themselves. This is despite regulations of the Lotteries Act requiring organisations that receive grants to procure \u201cgoods or services\u201d using a \u201ctransparent and competitive process\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe processes of the NLC are such that funded entities independently source services from the market to achieve whatever it is that they have been funded for,\u201d the NLC\u2019s communications head Ndivhuho Mafela said in an email in response to questions. \u201cTechnically, therefore, the NLC would not be aware of information about such service providers.\u201d\n\nAnd, often, the proactive funding is given to non-profit companies with no track record. These are formed by accountants or attorneys and made tax compliant. They are then sold \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d and ready for business, with the original directors who set them up resigning and new directors being appointed.\n\nKuruman\u2019s Lottery-funded projects\n\nFor our latest stories, we visited Kuruman in the Northern Cape to investigate three different projects: an old age home, a drug rehabilitation centre and a library and museum meant to celebrate the life and work of sangoma, author and African storyteller Credo Mutwa.\n\nAlmost R60m was granted to the three projects, but two are still under construction almost two years after they received Lottery funding, while the museum has a single exhibit and the library\u2019s shelves are empty.\n\nResponding to a question about the delays in construction, NLC spokesperson Ndivhuho Mafela said, \u201cIt is in the nature of construction that you have unplanned delays which impact on the overall completion of the facilities. This is however reported regularly by our engineers and we are satisfied with the progress on all the facilities that we are building. We have, however, indicated that all projects should be handed over to the communities this year.\u201d\n\nLinks to NLC\u2019s COO\n\nPKT Consulting Engineers, which is involved in the construction of Lethabong Old Age, and the recently completed Credo Mutwa Museum and Library, has links to NLC Chief Operating Officer Phillemon Letwaba and members of his family.\n\nLetwaba, his wife Daisy, and his brother Johannes, as well as their father Oupa, who has since died, were all directors of PKT before they resigned their directorships on March 1, 2017.\n\nOn the same day that the Letwabas resigned, Themba Mabundza was appointed as the sole director of PKT. Mabundza, 37, is an active director in 54 different companies across a wide spectrum of industries.\n\nTwo of the companies of which he is a director have received grants from the Lottery. One, Life for Impact in the 21st Century, was awarded R8m on 19 April 2017, and a further R2 106 800 just over a month later on 31 May 2017, a total of R10 106 800. The grants were made via the NLC\u2019s Arts, Culture and Natural Heritage sector.\n\nThe first payment to Life for Impact was made about six weeks after the purchase of an existing non-profit company, which appears to have been bought \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d as a tax compliant entity. The three original directors resigned and Mabundza, Ivonne Sibongile Kheswa and Patricia Dikeledi Nkosi were then appointed as directors on 3 March 2017.\n\nZibsimanzi, a second off-the-shelf company where Mabundza is a director, received a R4.8 million grant from the NLC\u2019s Sports sector on 21 November 2017. The grant was made about eight months after Mabundza, Rebotile Mashaba and Judith Nonhlanhla were appointed directors on 4 May 2017.\n\nIt is unclear what projects the funds granted to Life for Impact and Zibsimanzi were for. A search of both turned up no NLC-funded or any other projects that they are \u2013 or have been - involved in. The NLC has not responded to our query asking for details.\n\nKaone Wethu, a second company involved in the construction of the museum and old age home, also has links to business associates of Letwaba. One of its former directors, Keneilwe Constance Maboa, is either still an active director or has resigned some of her directorships in at least five companies linked to Letwaba\u2019s family. These include Mosadi Ditshabeng Modjadji, where she is a still a co-director with Letwaba\u2019s younger brother, Thabo. She was also a co-director of Ironbridge Traveling Agency and Events and Redtaq with Thabo Letwaba before they resigned in March and June respectively.\n\nThe current listed director of Kaone Wethu is Karabo Charles Sithole, a former director of PKT, Redtaq, and Ironbridge. These companies are or were at one time linked to Letwaba or members of his family.\n\nPhillemon Letwaba served as the NLC\u2019s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) before being appointed COO in 2017. For at least two years he was simultaneously both CFO and the NLC\u2019s acting executive on all grants.\n\nA leaked document compiled three years ago by a concerned high-up NLC whistleblower emphasises the power Letwaba wielded through holding these joint positions. The whistleblower also raised the potential for \u201cconflicts of interest\u201d and the \u201cmanipulation\u201d of grants.\n\n\u201cThe sudden urgency of approving so many proactive funding applicants whilst long-standing grant agreements are not being finalised for payment are worrisome.\u201d\n\nIn November last year, GroundUp revealed how Upbrand Properties, a company in which Letwaba\u2019s brother, Johannes, was the sole director, signed a R15m contract to build a rehabilitation centre near Pretoria. Although Johannes Letwaba subsequently resigned his directorship, Companies and Intellectual Property Commission records confirm that he was a director at the time of the signing of the multimillion-rand contract.\n\nDespite this, the NLC issued a statement clearing its COO of any conflict of interest. \u201cThe NLC follows strict prescribed processes and continually encourages its employees to disclose matters of conflict of interest where applicable. It has since engaged individuals who may have been highlighted in some of the issues raised around the implementation and funding of the project [the rehab] and is satisfied with explanations provided.\u201d\n\nThe NLC has also released a statement saying it received a clean audit for 2018/19.\n\nLetwaba\u2019s wife, Daisy, and Melanie du Plessis are directors of a company called Signature Kitchen Design that was registered on 20 September 2016. Du Plessis is the girlfriend of a controversial lawyer who is associated with companies and organisations that have received tens of millions of rands in Lottery funding.\n\nIn response to questions about Letwaba, the NLC wrote: \u201cWe have been advised by the official that he has referred the matter to his lawyers but he has denied any conflict of interest on this matter.\u201d\n\nREAD: How a hijacked organisation scored millions from the Lottery\n\nLetwaba\u2019s lawyer later said in an email that Letwaba had been given insufficient time to respond to our questions, but nevertheless said his client had nothing further to add to the NLC\u2019s responses. (We gave Letwaba ample time. He has had sight of the questions sent to the NLC for several days. Despite this we gave him an additional day after receiving this letter. We have received no response.)\n\nHis wife also did not respond to questions we sent to Letwaba\u2019s lawyer for her.\n\nAfter becoming aware of this writer\u2019s visit to Kuruman, the NLC distributed a media statement claiming that I had approached Lottery-funded projects \u201crequesting sensitive information\u201d.\n\nAnd, despite the fact that I had identified myself to all the people I spoke to in Kuruman as a journalist on assignment for GroundUp, the NLC alleged that I was falsely \u201cclaiming to be from a mine that is working in partnership with the NLC\u201d.\n\nThe NLC statement added: \u201cWe encourage beneficiaries who have been approached in this manner or by anybody claiming to be a representative of the NLC to report this to the organisation\u2019s fraud line.\u201d\n\nThe South African Editors Forum subsequently issued a statement condemning the NLC\u2019s media release.\n\nThemba Mabundza failed to respond to questions sent to his official PKT email address.\n\nMelanie du Plessis did not respond to questions sent to her via WhatsApp.\n\nWe will publish part two of this series on Monday.", "description": "Undeclared conflicts of interest and incomplete or shoddy construction characterise many projects funded by the National Lotteries Commission (NLC).
