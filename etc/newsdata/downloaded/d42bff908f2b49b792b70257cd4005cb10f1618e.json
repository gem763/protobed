AMBA, -1.50% plunged 14% in premarket trading Tuesday, in the wake of the Trump administration's move to blacklist Chinese technology companies that develop facial recognition and artificial intelligence technology, which the U.S. says is being used to repress China's Muslim groups. The blacklisted companies include Hikvision and Dahua, the Associated Press reported, which Stifel Nicolaus analyst Tore Svanberg estimates represent about 15% of Ambarella's total revenue, or about 25% of its security camera revenue. \"While we believe Ambarella may be able to continue to ship product to these customers due to a significant R&D presence outside the U.S., we expect the companies will struggle to meet the full bill of materials and are likely to begin working through inventory that has been built over the last several quarters,\" Svanberg wrote in a note to clients. He reiterated his hold rating but cut his stock price target to $54 from $61. The stock has soared 27.5% over the past three months through Monday, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, -0.71% has gained 7.8% and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.45% has slipped 1.3%.", "description": "Shares of chip maker Ambarella Inc. plunged 14% in premarket trading Tuesday, in the wake of the Trump administration's move to blacklist Chinese technology...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
