The US Masters champion smoked a massive drive down the long par-four 17th and his pinpoint approach from 154 yards left him a simple two-footer to take the solo lead.\n\nHe saw a 20-foot eagle putt slip by at the par-five 18th but tapped in for his seventh birdie and a two-round 12-under par total of 128.\n\nUS Open champion Woodland admitted he had to dig deep to be in the final group for Sunday\u2019s third round alongside Woods.\n\n\u201cIt was a grind all day,\u201d said the 35 year-old. \u201cI didn\u2019t have my best stuff today. Fortunately I made three big putts there on 16, 17 and 18 which was awesome.\n\n\u201cAll in all, I\u2019m happy to not have my best stuff and shoot four-under.\n\nFriday\u2019s postponed round finally began at 10am Saturday on a weather-ravaged course but under clear blue skies and bright sunshine helping to dry the turf.\n\n\u2013 New lake on 10th \u2013\n\nA pond to the left of the 10th fairway had expanded into a lake under the sheer volume of rain, submerging the fairway.\n\nIt forced PGA Tour Rules and Competition officials to move the tee forward, and in a trice the 376-yard dogleg was reduced to just 140 yards, but kept its par-four status.\n\nEarly starter and local favourite Hideki Matsuyama immediately took advantage of the tiny 10th with an eagle two before finishing three under for the day and four shots back from Woods.\n\nWorld number two Rory McIlroy had a ragged two-over 72 on Thursday but he too opened with an eagle at the 10th to get back to level par immediately.\n\nA birdie four at the long 14th kept up the momentum and two more gains at 16 and 18 saw him turn in 31.\n\nOne more birdie followed but a sloppy five-foot miss for par after splashing out of a bunker on his final hole, meant he finished with a 65 to be three-under for the tournament.\n\nAmerican Keegan Bradley stormed up the leaderboard with a seven-under 63, the best round of the week, to position himself well for the final two rounds at eight-under par.\n\n\u201cI made like a 30-footer for par on four or five and that really got me rolling and I made a bunch of putts after that,\u201d said the 2011 US PGA Championship winner.\n\nThe rescheduled third round will begin at 6.30am on Sunday (2130 GMT Saturday) and players will roll into the fourth round immediately after.\n\nThe field will play until darkness forces them from the course around 5pm local time (0800 GMT) with the tournament concluding on Monday.", "description": "Inzai (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Tiger Woods shot a second successive sumptuous six-under par 64 Saturday and will go into Sunday\u2019s rain-delayed third", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/dc8eae_prowling-tiger-woods-lines-up-putt-on-green-saturday-pga-tour-zozo-championship-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
