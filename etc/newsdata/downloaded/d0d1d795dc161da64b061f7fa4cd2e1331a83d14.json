However, based on what he has been finding, Durham has expanded his investigation adding agents and resources, the senior administration officials said. The timeline has grown from the beginning of the probe through the election and now has included a post-election timeline through the spring of 2017, up to when Robert Mueller was named special counsel.\n\nThat's the same Robert Mueller who testified under oath he was \"not familiar\" with Fusion GPS after years investigating a supposed scandal instigated by that company. This eye-rolling lie is far more significant than anything he has prosecuted others for. This is the same Mueller who also lied, administration officials just informed us, in denying, again under oath, he interviewed for the FBI job before becoming special counsel.\n\nActually, it's worse. As the president's former lawyer John Dowd put it: \u201cCapt. Robert Mueller, USMC, sits in front of his commander in chief being interviewed for FBI director knowing he is going to investigate the president and never says a word.\u201d\n\nComey and Mueller--separated at birth, two extremely pompous liars. No wonder they're pals. But leave all that aside. What has Durham found, possibly in concert with his superior AG William Barr, that necessitated expansion of his work?\n\nIt could be related to the length of time it is taking Inspector General Michael Horowitz to deliver his more limited report that has been repeatedly promised for some months now. Previously, Horowitz was criticized for pulling his punches on the Hillary Clinton investigation. This will not be so easy now with Barr and Durham going over the same material. Horowitz is not able to interview those no longer working for the government--most of the potential miscreants having slipped away--but Barr and Durham have no such restriction. They can follow leads anywhere.\n\nRecently that has taken them to Italy to speak with intelligence officials. They have also apparently spoken with their peers in Australia and the UK. Did something come of that? It would be strange if it didn't, especially now that we have learned that Durham's mission has expanded, \"adding agents and resources.\".\n\nThis indeed should strike fear in the hearts of the Democrats. The Department of Justice holds the whip hand. They can indict people. Yes, the Democratic Congress can impeach. And no wonder they are trying their best to do that now. They are riding high--or some of them may think they are--because of polls and the nonstop outrage of the media.\n\nBut most of the public doesn't know the full story or anything close. The truth rarely emerges quickly. In Churchill's words, \"A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.\" Eventually, however, it does. And when it does, in this case, if the Democrats have already impeached a president--if it turns out there was a coup plot or something close involving the CIA, the previous administration and others--there will be hell to pay in this country like we haven't seen since the 1860s, maybe worse.\n\nOne would advise the Democrats to reconsider, but they don't seem able to do it. They probably have too much to lose.\n\nEscape from the nonstop yammering about impeachment from liberal reactionaries with a fun read. PJ Media co-founder Roger L.
