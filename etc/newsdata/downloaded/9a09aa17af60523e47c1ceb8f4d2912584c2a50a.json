Revenues climbed five percent to $12.6 billion.\n\nBut shares tumbled after the company projected fourth-quarter profits of between $1.20 and $1.50 per share, below the $1.51 projected by analysts.\n\nThe company is spending more on staff and infrastructure to address a network that one executive said was practically \"bursting at the seams\" as the company has scrambled in recent months with heavy consumer loads and rebookings due to bad weather.\n\nBastian described the spending as a \"long-term investment that I'm confident is going to have long-term returns\" by meeting expectations on customer service.\n\nDelta last week sharply criticized new 10 percent tariffs announced by the Trump administration that hit US aircraft imports from Europe following a World Trade Organization ruling in a long-standing trade dispute involving Airbus and Boeing.\n\nBastian said the tariffs would not affect new Airbus A321 narrow-body planes that are built in Alabama. But larger Airbus aircraft are made overseas.\n\n\"At this point, we're looking at our options,\" Bastian said. \"We do not expect this is going to be a material cost to Delta.\"\n\nShares of Delta were down 3.4 percent at $52.12 near midday.", "description": "Delta Air Lines reported higher third-quarter profits on Thursday and offered an upbeat outlook on US consumers but shares fell over a fourth-quarter forecast that reflects higher-than-expected costs.
