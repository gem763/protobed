The company will suspend its share buyback programme while it pays off debt.\n\nThe reliance on travelling consumers was highlighted on Thursday when WH Smith reported a 7% rise in headline annual pre-tax profit, boosted by a 14% jump in earnings from its travel business.\n\nHeadline profit before tax rose to 155 million pounds from 145 million pounds in the year ended Aug. 31, marginally beating analyst estimates of 154.2 million pounds, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nThe company also said it was prepared for Brexit and has put in place contingency plans, including increasing the stock of convenience products.
