This makes them more or less inappropriate to common technical signals. If you wish to apply technical signals to your trading you might better apply them to SZC, which covers the entire spectrum of the energy patch. As it is \"usually\" not quite so short-term volatile, you might then better apply MACD historigram, Parabolic SAR, 10-day/30-day moving avg crossovers, etc, as your buy/sell trigger signals. This way you attempt to minimize emotion, opinions and hunches.\n\nIf there is a lo-vol broad-spectrum energy ETF, that also might be a good vehicle.
