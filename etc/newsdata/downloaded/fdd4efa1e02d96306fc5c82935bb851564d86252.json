In a May interview with the Associated Press, he said that splitting up companies such as Facebook was \"something we should take a really hard look at\" but that it was \"premature\" to make a final judgment. The campaign told Reuters that, as president, Biden would aggressively use \"all the tools available - including utilizing antitrust measures\" to ensure corporations act responsibly. He did not speak up during a discussion of the issue at the most recent Democratic debate in October. Biden has criticized e-commerce giant Amazon's $0 federal tax bill in 2018. \"I have nothing against Amazon, but no company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers. We need to reward work, not just wealth,\" he said in a tweet in June. His campaign also clashed with Facebook, Twitter and Google over their political ad policies after they refused to take down a Trump ad that the Biden team said contained false claims about his son Hunter's dealings with Ukraine.
