Notably, the ETF product is designed:\n\n\u201c[...] To provide exposure to bitcoin at a price that is reflective of the actual bitcoin market where investors can purchase and sell Bitcoin, less the expenses of the Trust\u2019s operations.\u201d\n\nThe company plans to hold Bitcoin and value the shares of the trust according to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Bitcoin Reference Rate. The cryptocurrency will be held at an unspecified third-party insured custodian that is also regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\n\nThe SEC filing also details that the Trust will hold Bitcoin \u201cin seeking to ensure that the price of the Trust\u2019s shares is reflective of the actual bitcoin market.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Trust will not purchase or sell bitcoin directly but will acquire it via shares called \u201cbaskets.\u201d The report continues:\n\n\u201cInstead, when it sells or redeems its Shares, it will do so in \u2018in-kind\u2019 transactions in blocks of 100,000 Shares called \u2018Baskets\u2019 at the Trust\u2019s net asset value (\u2018NAV\u2019). Only Authorized Purchasers may purchase or redeem Shares with the Trust, and they will do so by delivering bitcoin to the Trust in exchange for Shares when they purchase Shares.\u201d\n\nA notable executive\n\nAnother notable detail is that the head of exchange-traded product at Kryptoin is Jason Toussaint, former managing director at the World Gold Council and ex asset manager of SPDR Gold Shares, one of the largest Gold ETFs in the world.\n\nMeanwhile, the race to launch the first regulated Bitcoin ETF is becoming increasingly competitive.\n\nEarlier this month, documents revealed that the Wilshire Phoenix Fund has updated its own Bitcoin ETF proposal filed with the SEC. Also this month, asset manager Bitwise alongside NYSE Arca confirmed the intention to refile their application for a Bitcoin ETF after the latest SEC rejection.", "description": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission published the new application for a Bitcoin ETF recently submitted by asset manager Kryptoin Investment Advisor", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYjEzNGFhYTkzYWQ1ODcyNDQ2MzhiNWZmYzZkMDA4MzQuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
