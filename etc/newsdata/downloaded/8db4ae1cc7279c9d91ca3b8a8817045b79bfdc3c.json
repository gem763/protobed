Unless the U.S. ended economic sanctions on Iran, he said, any such meeting between the two leaders would be just a photo op and \"that is not possible.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Francois Mori/AP Francois Mori/AP\n\nThe continued stalemate likely comes as a disappointment to French President Emmanuel Macron, who has worked overtime trying to bring Trump and Rouhani to the table, saying Monday that he hoped to see such a meeting in \"coming weeks.\"\n\nAt the G-7 held in the southwestern coastal city of Biarritz, Macron invited Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, and other Iranian diplomats to the summit's venue as he employed a form of shuttle diplomacy between them and Trump to try to work out the details of a high-level face-to-face, according to The Associated Press.\n\nTehran and Washington have not had diplomatic relations since 1980. Trump last year unilaterally withdrew from an Obama-era international agreement that gave Iran sanctions relief in exchange for limits on its nuclear program.\n\nIn recent months, Tehran has announced that it would cross limits imposed by the multinational pact on the size and potency of its nuclear stockpile.\n\nTehran has also been blamed for attacks on commercial tankers in and around the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic waterway through which much of the world's oil transits.\n\nIn July after the United Kingdom seized an Iranian tanker thought to be carrying fuel to Syria in violation of international sanctions, Iran seized a British-flagged tanker, the Stena Impero.\n\nThe Iranian vessel was released earlier this month, but the British vessel is still being held.", "description": "The Iranian president's remarks on Tuesday were in contrast to an initially favorable reception to the idea.
