REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, announced the investigation at a news conference, declaring \u201cno one is above the law.\u201d\n\nThere has been a groundswell of support among Democratic Party lawmakers for the move following Trump\u2019s public admission that he asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the son of presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday that the July 25 phone call was \u201cvery friendly and totally appropriate\u201d and that he put \u201cno pressure\u201d on Zelenskiy. He later called the House probe \u201cWitch Hunt Garbage\u201d in a tweet.\n\nThe following explains how the impeachment process works.\n\nWHY IMPEACHMENT?\n\nThe founders of the United States created the office of the presidency and feared its powers could be abused. So they included in the U.S. Constitution a procedure for removing a sitting president from office.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the president can be removed from office for \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly that means is unclear. Historically, it can encompass corruption and other abuses of the public\u2019s trust.\n\nA president does not need to have violated a specific criminal law to have committed an impeachable offence.\n\nMany legal commentators have said that pressuring a foreign leader to interfere in a U.S. election is the sort of conduct the nation\u2019s founders would have considered an impeachable offence.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nA misconception about \u201cimpeachment\u201d is that it refers to the removal of a president from office. In fact, impeachment refers only to the House, the lower chamber of Congress, bringing charges - similar to an indictment in a criminal case.\n\nThere is ongoing debate over how an impeachment investigation should begin. Doug Collins, the leading Republican on the Judiciary Committee, has argued that a formal impeachment investigation does not begin until the full House has voted to authorise it. But Democratic lawmakers have argued that such a vote is not necessary.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee has historically led impeachment investigations, but Democratic Party leaders can also opt to put a select, handpicked committee in charge.\n\nIf a simple majority of the House\u2019s 435 members approves bringing charges, known as \u201carticles of impeachment,\u201d the process moves to the Senate, the upper chamber, which holds a trial to determine the president\u2019s guilt.\n\nIn such a trial, House members act as the prosecutors, the senators as jurors; the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court presides. A two-thirds majority vote is required in the 100-member Senate to convict and remove a president.\n\nLawmakers are not required to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 the evidentiary standard in a criminal case.\n\nPARTY BREAKDOWN IN CONGRESS?\n\nThe House has 235 Democrats, 199 Republicans, and one independent. As a result, the Democrats could impeach Trump with no Republican support.\n\nIn 1998, when Republicans had a House majority, the chamber voted largely along party lines to impeach President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. Two and a half months passed between the House voting to move forward with impeachment proceedings against Clinton and his impeachment.\n\nThe Senate now has 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two independents who usually vote with the Democrats. Conviction and removal of a president would require 67 votes. So, for Trump to be removed from office via impeachment, at least 20 Republicans and all the Democrats and independents would have to vote against him.\n\nThe Republican majority in the Senate could vote to immediately dismiss the charges against Trump without considering evidence.\n\nNo president has ever been removed as a direct result of impeachment. One, President Richard Nixon, resigned in 1974 before he could be impeached. Two, Presidents Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Clinton, were impeached by the House, but not convicted by the Senate.\n\nWHO BECOMES PRESIDENT IF TRUMP IS REMOVED?\n\nIn the unlikely event the Senate convicted Trump, Vice President Mike Pence would become president for the remainder of Trump\u2019s term, which ends on Jan. 20, 2021.\n\nIS THERE ANOTHER WAY TO REMOVE A PRESIDENT?\n\nUnder the Constitution\u2019s 25th Amendment, a president can be replaced by their vice president if the chief executive becomes unable to do the job, such as due to a disabling medical or mental condition. That process begins with the vice president and a majority of the members of the Cabinet notifying Congress that the president is not capable of performing the job.", "description": "The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday launched an official impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump after he encouraged a foreign leader to conduct a probe that could damage a political rival.", "authors": ["Jan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433526536&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N2CJ", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
