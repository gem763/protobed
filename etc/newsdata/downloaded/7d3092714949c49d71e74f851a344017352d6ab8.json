Help me fight this epidemic.", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Conservative commentator Eric Bolling and USA TODAY's Bill Sternberg, who lost sons to opioids, discuss what families need to know about addiction. USA TODAY\n\nThere\u2019s nothing worse than to bury your child. My purpose on Earth is to save others from having to join me in this hellish fraternity.\n\nA year ago, a Boeing 737 Max aircraft crashed after takeoff in Indonesia, killing 189 people. Less than five months later, another 737 Max went down in Ethiopia, killing 157.\n\nThe grisly accidents produced an international uproar, and the Max jetliners remain grounded.\n\nNow imagine a 737 Max crashing every single day. In America. Imagine the carnage and the outrage.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Opioid overdoses kill more than 130 people per day in the United States, the equivalent of a daily plane crash. Yet where\u2019s the outrage?\n\nAmerica is negligent in the national opioid death epidemic. Maybe that\u2019s because we have always felt drug overdoses are about shady dealers and addicts shooting up in dark alleys.\n\nI have news for you. Opioids are crossing paths with your sons, daughters, sisters, brothers, parents and co-workers as you read this.\n\nI got 'The Call' and cried for two hours\n\nParents: Wake up! Your kid isn\u2019t too white, too black, too Hispanic, too straight, too gay, too smart, too popular or too cool to be affected. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s the captain of the football team or she\u2019s the prom queen.\n\nOpioids are killing indiscriminately. They don\u2019t care who you are.\n\nYour kids may well have been offered opioids already if they\u2019re over 10 years old. That\u2019s right \u2014 10. Even our middle schools are dealing with an opioid problem.\n\nDriving home on a Labor Day weekend evening, I got \u201cThe Call.\u201d As a parent, it\u2019s a call that makes the hair on the back of your neck go rigid. All I heard was a girl, a friend of my son, Eric Chase, whimpering.\n\nIn total fear, I asked: \u201cKayla ... is he still alive?\u201d To this day, I really don\u2019t know why that was the first and only thing out of my mouth.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nMy wife, Adrienne, who was driving, pulled over to the side of the road, let out a scream \u2014 NOOOOOOOOOOO! \u2014 and then spilled out onto the busy roadway.\n\nI gathered her, and we sat on the curb and cried for two hours as the traffic passed by. The world was spinning, and for the first time in my life I was genuinely lost and confused.\n\nAdrienne just kept repeating \u201cno ... no ... no ... no\u201d over and over again.\n\nIt didn\u2019t make sense. Eric Chase was a good student, a better athlete and a great kid. He was my best friend, my only child, my son. And he was gone.\n\nA Xanax laced with fentanyl\n\nEric Chase bought what he thought was a legitimate Xanax on campus at the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n\nApparently, this goes on all the time across college campuses, with students looking to \u201crelax\u201d for an exam or to combat the stress of a competitive academic environment.\n\nThe Xanax my son bought turned out to have been laced with fentanyl, a potent synthethic opioid produced primarily in China and Mexico.\n\nHe never woke up.\n\nMy life was altered that moment and will never ever be the same, nor whole, again.\n\nA journalist's tragic story: The opioid crisis hits home. Mine.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, with whom I\u2019ve been friends for more than a decade, called me that next morning. He expressed his absolute sorrow and empathy.\n\nI remain grateful for that and many subsequent \u201cchecking in\u201d calls from the president.\n\nSix weeks later, Sinclair Broadcast Group executives offered me an opportunity to get the message about opioid dangers out to their massive national TV audience.\n\nThey gave me a television platform, and I took the message to 15 town halls in 15 cities across America.\n\nIn two of the cities, first lady Melania Trump joined me on stage. I brought in Cabinet secretaries, the federal drug czar, the surgeon general and countless law enforcement officers and first responders throughout the tour.\n\nTogether, we learned a lot about this epidemic.\n\nMy son will be saving lives\n\nThis September, on the two-year anniversary of Eric\u2019s death, I joined JanOne as chairman and president. The company\u2019s name reflects the new beginnings and clean starts we make on the first of the year. I am committed to bringing solutions to the opioid epidemic forward from this platform.\n\nI plan to bring in doctors and researchers to find ways to combat a deadly killer in opioids. We will be developing strategies to save lives through nonaddictive alternatives to opioids. We will assess recovery systems and their efficacy (not their profitability).\n\nWe want to remove the stigma of opioid addiction so no other parents have to live the tragic nightmare I am living.\n\nAll proceeds from my participation in JanOne are going directly into The Eric Chase Foundation I created to bring awareness of the deadly opioid epidemic.\n\nThis way, Eric Chase will be saving lives, even if his couldn\u2019t be saved.\n\nCloser than you think: We thought we knew what drug addiction looked like. Then our nephew died in our house.\n\nLet\u2019s start with this.\n\nSince drug overdoses kill more people in America than automobiles, guns and most cancers each year, I propose January as \u201cNational Opioid Awareness Month.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll be meeting with Jim Carroll, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, as well as the president and first lady to discuss this idea and others.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing worse than to bury your child. My purpose on Earth is to save others from having to join me in this hellish fraternity.\n\nEric Bolling is host of \u201cAmerica This Week\u201d on Sinclair Broadcast Group, host of \u201cAmerica\u201d on BlazeTV and president and chairman of JanOne.
