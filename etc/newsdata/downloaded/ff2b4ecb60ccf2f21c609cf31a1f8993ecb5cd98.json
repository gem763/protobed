It has dropped below 0 (dashed line) which indicates an inversion of the yield curve.\n\n2/10 Yield Curve\n\nPast performance is not an indicator of future results.\n\nCHART SOURCE: tradingview\n\nAs can be seen from the chart the capitulation in the spread began on 1 August (orange arrow) when President Trump announced that a further 10% tariff will be imposed on the remaining $300 billion imports from China.\n\nThe markets moved with a greater decline in the 10-year yield compared to the 02-year yield. There are a few possible reasons for this. Firstly the 2-year is a good proxy for Fed policy and the movement down reflected the pressure exerted on the Fed for further rate cuts. However, US data doesn\u2019t support a rate cutting cycle. Yesterday\u2019s CPI came in at 1.8%, and whilst not quite at the 2% target nor the preferred measure of inflation by the Fed, the number is significant as it beat forecast. This has provided some support for the 2yr.\n\nMoreover, the 10-year bond is more indicative of investor preference and the fact that the yields have fallen show a fear of recession. I.e. Investors are willing to allocate capital to a low yielding asset because of its safe haven status. That this was triggered on 1 August is the markets response to the tariff announcement.\n\nA corollary of this is that if inflation is emerging, bond investors may be hurt as interest rates correct. If this is the case it is the result of misallocations due to political interference that have unwittingly introduced inefficiency into the market.\n\nThe fact that these tariffs have now been pushed back is likely indicative of a miscalculation.
