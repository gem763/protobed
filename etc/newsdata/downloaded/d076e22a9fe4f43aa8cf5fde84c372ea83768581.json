USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 The fiery point guard entered the Thunder\u2019s locker room. Within seconds, Russell Westbrook heard a stern and playful message.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in the wrong locker room,\u201d a few Thunder players joked.\n\nWestbrook refused to listen. The Houston Rockets had just finished with a 116-112 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday, marking Westbrook\u2019s first start against his former team since the Thunder dealt him in an offseason trade for Chris Paul and a handful of future draft picks. So after bulldozing his way toward a near triple-double in points (21), rebounds (12) and assists (nine), Westbrook wanted to show the nicer side to his personality and catch up with old friends.\n\nToo bad the Thunder\u2019s current point guard jokingly became unpleasant.\n\n\u201cThe Clippers tried to suspend me for this,\u201d Paul joked, referring to when the Rockets attempted to barge into the Clippers\u2019 locker room following contentious on-court exchanges during a 2018 game. \u201cCome on man. You got to get out of here.\u201d\n\nShould any of this have been surprising? Both Westbrook and Paul faced their former team with the determination to exert their influence at nearly every moment.\n\nThough James Harden led the Rockets with 40 points on plenty of shooting from the field (9-of-21), from 3-point range (3-of-14) and the free-throw line (21-of-22), Westbrook arguably had a bigger influence on shaping the Rockets' identity. He fueled a 10-0 run to open the third quarter that included a rebound, layup and assist. He pushed the pace any chance he could. And he did so without allowing any warm feelings about the Thunder to compromise his on-court intensity.\n\n\u201cWhen I hoop, I have no friends. On the court, they know not to talk to me,\" Westbrook said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m inside those lines, there are no friends. Spalding \u2013 that\u2019s my friend, and my teammates.\u201d\n\nRussell Westbrook on facing OKC: \u201cWhen I\u2019m hooping, I have no friends.\u201d pic.twitter.com/DFbn5jN8cC \u2014 Mark Medina (@MarkG_Medina) October 29, 2019\n\nPaul shared a similar mentality, but he finished with different results. Paul had 15 points on only 6-of-14 shooting, five rebounds and four assists, a performance as low-key as the respectful reception he received during lineup introductions before a half-empty arena. He missed his first four shots and did not score until 54.9 seconds were left in the first half. He missed a potential game-tying 3 with about 1:47 remaining. Paul only seemed nostalgic when he watched the Rockets\u2019 tribute video of him following the first timeout with 5:57 left in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cExtremely grateful. The fans were always great to me and my family,\u201d said Paul, who then named some of the Rockets\u2019 staff members. \u201cSome of the people here became like family to me. I tried to stay in touch with those who were as genuine as could be.\u201d\n\nInteresting that Paul made those comments without mentioning Rockets owner Tillman Fertitta, general manager Daryl Morey or Harden. He even joked that he might get in trouble for talking every day to Rockets forward P.J. Tucker and reserve Gary Clark. Still, Paul and others on the Rockets have downplayed reports that tension with Harden contributed to his departure. Harden also stressed he did not see Paul when the two got tangled up after he threw a lob to Westbrook in the third quarter.\n\nEither way, the Rockets traded Paul to Oklahoma City for practical reasons.\n\nHouston had acquired Paul in a sign-and-trade from the Los Angeles Clippers only two years ago, leaving the Rockets believing they finally had enough to unseat the Golden State Warriors. It became enough for the Rockets to land the No. 1 seed with 65 regular-season wins. It was not enough to win an NBA championship, though. Paul strained his right hamstring toward the end of a Game 5 win in the 2018 Western Conference finals. The Warriors then won the next two games, including a decisive Game 7 as the Rockets missed 27 consecutive 3-pointers.\n\nPaul struggled to stay durable the following season. He missed a combined 17 games with a strained left hamstring, and looked limited in the NBA playoffs. Paul also had various injuries with the Los Angeles Clippers in the NBA playoffs in 2015 (left hamstring) and 2016 (right hand).\n\nMore: Rockets' D'Antoni exudes calm despite lame-duck status: 'It's not going to change the way I coach'\n\nMore: Brandon Ingram putting burden on himself to carry Pelicans without Zion Williamson\n\nStill, Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni argued that the 34-year-old Paul is \u201cgoing to be good for another four years if he wants.\u201d Thunder coach Billy Donovan expressed similar optimism because of Paul\u2019s meticulous training, dietary and sleeping habits.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to continue to work,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThere\u2019s only 420 of these jobs. You\u2019re not going to take my job because you outwork me.\u201d\n\nRussell took Paul\u2019s job, though. The Rockets willingly mortgaged their future so that Harden and Westbrook could reunite for the first time in seven years since playing together with the Thunder (2009-2012). They showed plenty of chemistry in only their third game together in a Rockets uniform.\n\nHouston Rockets guard Russell Westbrook dribbles the ball as Oklahoma City Thunder guard Chris Paul defends during the first quarter at Toyota Center.

On other plays, Westbrook routinely set up Tucker so many times for open 3\u2019s that D\u2019Antoni joked that Tucker \u201cshould take him out to dinner.\u201d Shortly after forcing a turnover, Westbrook finished with a late third-quarter dunk that prompted him to yell.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to me to be able to make sure my guys are ready to go,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cAnd not just ready, but competing and playing hard because playing hard is something that is not an option for me. It\u2019s something you have to take pride in. To get to that elite level, you have to do that every night.\u201d\n\nBeard to Brodie \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/PyulWYZWjC \u2014 Houston Rockets (@HoustonRockets) October 29, 2019\n\nThe Thunder will miss that about Westbrook. No matter. OKC still dealt Westbrook last summer to Houston for Paul, a pair of first-round selections (2024, 2026) and pick swaps (2021, 2025), a move that became necessary to retool following Paul George\u2019s trade request to the Los Angeles Clippers. After spending 11 seasons in Oklahoma City, collecting a regular-season MVP award, two scoring titles and the majority of his triple-doubles, Westbrook no longer guides the Thunder with his unmatched speed, his scoring bursts, his playmaking and his rebounding.\n\nPerhaps Westbrook\u2019s presence would have made little difference, anyway. Following Kevin Durant\u2019s departure three years ago, the Thunder have not advanced past the first round of the NBA playoffs. Without Paul, perhaps Russell\u2019s efforts would have produced just empty calories. So, the Thunder dealt their last future Hall-of-Famer in hopes that they can select future ones in upcoming drafts. Meanwhile, the Thunder dealt Paul for second-year guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, veteran wing Danilo Gallinari and five first-round picks (2021, 2022, 2023 2024, 2026).\n\n\u201cSometimes I have to tell myself to shut up,\u201d Paul said about playing with a young roster. \u201cThere\u2019s so much I want them to learn so fast and I try to show them as much as possible and tell them playing is one thing, but watching and studying the game is a whole other game.\u201d\n\nThose players might want to study Westbrook and Paul. They both barked at officials and picked up technical fouls for it. They directed their teammates. They spoke before and after the game with former coaches and teammates they held in high regard. Once the game started, though? Then they turned serious.\n\n\u201cYou try to be my friend,\u201d Westbrook said, \u201cI ain\u2019t going to say (expletive) to you.\u201d\n\nHe said plenty in the Thunder locker room afterwards, though. So did Paul, who revealed his competitive side even during playful locker room banter.\n\nFollow USA TODAY NBA writer Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.", "description": "The Rockets' Russell Westbrook and the Thunder's Chris Paul faced each other for the first time since their offseason trade.
