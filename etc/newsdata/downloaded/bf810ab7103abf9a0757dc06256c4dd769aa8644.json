But he is a player of the highest level.\u201d\n\nWATCHING BALOTELLI\n\nMario Balotelli was at San Siro on Saturday to see his new club take on his old as Brescia lost 1-0 at AC Milan.\n\nBalotelli joined newly promoted Brescia after his deal with Marseille expired, returning to Serie A with his hometown club after an absence of three years.\n\nThe forward has to wait to make his debut as he serves a four-match ban following a straight red card in his final game for Marseille against Montpellier in May.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s working really hard, he\u2019s done double training sessions three times,\u201d Brescia coach Eugenio Corini said. \u201cHe\u2019s here with the right mentality, we\u2019re counting a lot on him.\u201d\n\nBalotelli\u2019s last spell in Italy was a miserable one as he struggled with injury and scored only once in a season-long loan at AC Milan before returning to Liverpool in 2016 and moving immediately to France, resurrecting his career first with Nice and then at Marseille.\n\nThat was Balotelli\u2019s second spell at Milan, the team he supported as a child.\n\nBalotelli\u2019s first appearance for Brescia will likely be the home match against eight-time defending champion Juventus on Sept. 25.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Some players appear to be taking advantage of newly implemented handball rules to deliberately win penalties.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Daniella Matar"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/02/italy_soccer_serie_a_44422_c0-122-2875-1798_s1770x1032.jpg?f05019bb29109d24dce851489f24c21e759e06dd"}
