Kyle W. Kusz, an associate professor in URI\u2019s Department of English, breaks down why he\u2019s sure Tom Brady is only popular because of racism in a book called \u201cThe Palgrave Handbook of Masculinity and Sport.\u201d\n\nIn his 22-page chapter, Mr. Kusz, who looks like the now well-known stereotype of a man who regularly declares himself a \u201cfeminist\u201d and would put his pronouns in his Twitter profile, says \u201cperformances of white masculinity\u201d by both Mr. Brady and of course President Trump show \u201chow they represent the cultural (re-) emergence and valorization of a white masculinity that unapologetically desires a manly omnipotence \u2026 .\u201d\n\nYou might need to read that sentence again because he/him wrote it in, \u2018I need to prove that I\u2019m smarter than you by using bigger words that aren\u2019t necessary\u2019 English \u2014 so I\u2019ll break it down for you. When translated, all he\u2019s saying is \u201cOrange man bad\u201d and \u201cFriend of Orange man who had a MAGA hat in his locker, also very bad.\u201d\n\nHe continues down the Trump Derangement Syndrome path by declaring Mr. Brady\u2019s Under Armour commercial to be similar to Nazi propaganda films because it uses a black and red color scheme, \u201cmilitaristic\u201d sounds, and an \u201carmy of Bradys \u2026 .\u201d\n\nI just want to stop at this point in my op-ed and seriously ask, who actually picked up this book and read it to find this chapter on Mr. Brady?\n\nThis is like a few weeks ago when Mollie Hemingway on her anniversary, God bless her, was the only person to read the new Brett Kavanaugh smear book, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d to discover that there was no new valid claim of sexual assault against Justice Kavanaugh when the media and Democratic candidates were running rampant with that tale. To Ms. Hemingway and whoever suffered through this book, I owe you a drink.\n\nMr. Kusz\u2019s ridiculous claim that Tom Brady is only popular because of white nationalism and hate honestly sounds like a game where progressives free-associate words to excuse away actual success. He could look to other incredibly popular athletes and do the same, except many of our current sports heroes and icons are \u2014 wait for it \u2014 not white males. And in trying to excuse away the incredible athletic success of say, LeBron James or Megan Rapinoe as something tied to race, gender or sex, he would be outcast from whatever social justice soir\u00e9e I assume he attends on Tuesday nights where they discuss cat grooming, newly created genders and hating Donald Trump.\n\nUnfortunately for un-athletic people like Mr. Kusz and I, we\u2019re stuck having to do things like write for a living \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t always come with the same glory, fame, models and multi-million dollar deals that come with being the greatest athlete of a generation. The difference between Mr. Kusz and I, however, is that I won\u2019t sit around excusing away the great success of anyone else by using tired progressive talking points and big words. I also won\u2019t get a book deal to opine about how I hate all the demographics about myself that I was born with and can\u2019t change.\n\nIf the left wants to beat Donald Trump and change the narrative, this is the wrong way to go about it. There are real issues of injustice and inequality in the world that we could all be working on. But instead, they\u2019ll lose the narrative, and the House of Representatives and continue to lose the White House as long as this type of lunacy continues to get a platform.\n\nSo unfortunately for people like me who hate the Patriots and Kyle W. Kusz who hates Donald Trump and white athletes who identify as male, Tom Brady is popular and rich and married a hot model because he\u2019s one of the greatest athletes of all time \u2014 not because of racism.\n\n\u2022 Tim Young is a political comedian and author of \u201cI Hate Democrats/I Hate Republicans\u201d (Post Hill Press).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
