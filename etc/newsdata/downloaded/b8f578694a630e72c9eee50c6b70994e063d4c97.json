I just think you are the most professional female and it's threatened everybody.'\n\nKeller then praised her friend for her strength and took aim at her cowardly trolls.\n\nTension: Rugby league legend Andrew Johns reportedly doesn't get along with Molan (pictured) after she replaced Paul 'Fatty' Vautin on The Footy Show last year\n\n'I just think in a few years' time people will look back - same as the Adam Goodes [booing] thing - and think, \"What did we do to her? Why did we do that?\"' she said.\n\nJones also showed his support for Molan, complimenting her on her achievements.\n\n'I admire the pants off you as well and I'm a man and I know a lot of men and they all rate you so don't fill your head with these d**kheads that say these horrible things,' he said.\n\n'You're such a nice person and I know you very well and I've known you before you reached the pinnacle of fame you have now.\n\n'You're well qualified to do this and [the online abuse] will go away.
