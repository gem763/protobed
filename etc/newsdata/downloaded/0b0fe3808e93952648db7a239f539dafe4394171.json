Each drought costs the United States about $9.5 billion, according to government statistics. It is the second most costly weather disaster, behind tropical cyclones. Droughts can drive up the cost of food, threaten drinking water, increase the risk of wildfires, cause mass migrations and even hurt people's health\n\nThe research, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, finds that greenhouse gases generated by power plants, farming, cars, trains and human activities in general have influenced the risk of droughts.\n\nThe researchers found that droughts increased between 1900 and 1949, lessened between 1950 and 1975 and have been accelerating since.\n\nEach of these periods seems to correspond with human activities. The drying trend at the start of the 20th century seems to be related to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, according to the authors.", "description": "Human activity has probably had an impact on the world's risk of drought since the start of the 20th century, according to a new study, which also predicts that droughts related to climate change will get much worse.", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190319111203-bolton-drought-uk-july-2018-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-01"}
