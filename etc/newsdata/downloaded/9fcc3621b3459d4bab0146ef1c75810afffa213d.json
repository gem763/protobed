The restricted free agent is away from the team as he tries to work out a new deal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to have him here soon,\u201d linemate Nathan MacKinnon said.\n\nFollowing a second straight playoff appearance, general manager Joe Sakic decided to reshape his roster. Kadri was acquired in the deal that sent defenseman Tyson Barrie and forward Alexander Kerfoot to Toronto. In other trades, Sakic acquired defenseman Kevin Connauton from Arizona and left wing Andre Burakovsky from Washington.\n\nSakic also added veteran center Pierre-Edouard Bellemare as a free agent and right wing Joonas Donskoi. They also selected defenseman Bowen Byram with the No. 4 overall pick in the draft.\n\n\u201cJoe said it fairly early on in the offseason process that we\u2019re going to be smart but aggressive,\u201d captain Gabriel Landeskog said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we were. We went out and got some really good pieces.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s in addition to already having one of the top lines in hockey with Landeskog, MacKinnon and Rantanen. Not only that, but a talented blue line buoyed by youngsters Cale Makar and Samuel Girard.\n\nNo wonder the Avalanche are on everyone\u2019s radar as a team to watch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have some pressure,\u201d MacKinnon said. \u201cWe\u2019re not just the bad Avs or whatever anymore. We\u2019re a contender and that\u2019s fun. We all want pressure. It\u2019s no fun coming in as an underdog. The best teams have pressure on them.\u201d\n\nHere are things to know before the Avalanche open the season Oct. 3 against Calgary:\n\nWHO\u2019S HERE: Connauton, RW Valeri Nichushkin, Bellemare, Byram, D Calle Rosen, Kadri, Donskoi and Burakovsky.\n\nWHO\u2019S NOT: Barrie, Kerfoot, F Carl Soderberg, F Derick Brassard, G Semyon Varlamov, F Sven Andrighetto, F Gabriel Bourque.\n\nKEY PLAYERS: Landeskog, MacKinnon and Rantanen combined for 106 goals and 155 assists a season ago. The team was 24-6-5 when they each collected a point in a game. Philipp Grubauer enters the season as the primary goaltender after going 7-0-2 in his final nine starts of the regular season to get the Avalanche into the postseason. He was 7-5 in Colorado\u2019s playoff run.\n\nOUTLOOK: Colorado is a pick by some pundits to make it to the final of the Western Conference. Kadri already sees something building. \u201cI love the expectation and love the standard these guys hold themselves to,\u201d he said. The Avalanche stunned the top-seeded Flames last season, winning the series 4-1, before falling in Game 7 to San Jose. \u201cIt\u2019s like every new season, you look back in the rearview mirror and learn from things, but you can\u2019t dwell on them,\u201d Landeskog said. \u201cYou have to move forward. It\u2019s a new year. It\u2019s a new group. We\u2019re super-excited what we have here.\u201d\n\nPREDICTION: The Avalanche stressed consistency as an important ingredient in taking the next step. Colorado was tied for the most points in the Western Conference after games on Dec. 7 and then went through a rough stretch that nearly cost the Avs a playoff spot before bouncing back. \u201cThe guys that were here last year, we definitely learned from that,\u201d Landeskog said. \u201cBecause from Dec. 1 through whatever, we weren\u2019t playing good enough. I don\u2019t know how many games we managed to win, but it wasn\u2019t enough. It nearly ended up costing us a playoff berth.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "New arrival Nazem Kadri wasn't with his Colorado Avalanche teammates very long before making a quick observation.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pat Graham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/wild_avalanche_hockey_56357_c0-213-2700-1787_s1770x1032.jpg?b50a83a3b0b8d67fe478b03f305477c62b87b269", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
