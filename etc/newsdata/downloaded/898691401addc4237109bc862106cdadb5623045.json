It wasn\u2019t until today that I realized I\u2019d gone 5-2 in my picks, running my season total to 20-15. That brightened my day, at least until I saw that the Steelers are on the road this week against the Chargers in San Diego, er, Los Angeles, er, Carson. Can a Duck Dynasty spark a comeback for Pittsburgh, or do I have to lose hope all over again?\n\nJazz: Did someone say something about me bouncing back last week? I bounced alright\u2026 straight into a faceplant on the concrete with a 3-4 showing. This dumped me at 18-17, trailing Ed and barely above .500. I hate playing catch-up. On the \u201cgood news\u201d front, the Jets are getting their mono-plagued sophmore quarterback back under center this week. The bad news is we lost a bunch of other people to injuries and suspensions, plus we\u2019re playing the Cowboys. I should buy stock in Hendricks Gin. Also, I apologize if some of my picks are kind of short today but I\u2019m filling this out while dealing with a computer crisis.\n\nEd: Let\u2019s get to our main picks. As I\u2019m writing this post, Carolina\u2019s up over Tampa Bay in London 10-7 early in the second, so it\u2019s off the board for predictions. That might turn out to be one of the better games today, though, so keep an eye on it. As mentioned above, the Steelers visit the Chargers in SoCal in the late game (8:20 pm ET, NBC) with the Chargers favored by a TD. Devlin \u201cDuck\u201d Hodges gets the start today for Pittsburgh after a credible relief last week of reliever Mason Rudolph, who remains stuck in the concussion protocol. LAC\u2019s offense racks up more yards but only scores a point more a game, although their D is four points stingier than the Steelers. Still, Duck might be even more effective after a week fo reps, so I\u2019ll take Pittsburgh over Dominguez Hills (or whatever) 23-20. The inconsistent Eagles come to Minnesota (1 pm, Fox) after Kirk Cousins\u2019 belated realization that he has receivers downfield. The Vikings\u2019 D will make all the difference here \u2014 that and Dalvin Cook\u2019s ground game. Minnesota over Philly 28-19. The J-E-T-S play host to the Cowboys, whose coach Jason Garrett needs a win. He\u2019ll get it easily. Dallas over NYJ 33-14.\n\nJazz: Philip Rivers can\u2019t be as bad as he looked last week and Pittsburgh still has more problems to solve than just a questionable offensive line. I\u2019d like to see Ed\u2019s team do well, but think the other team (whichever city they are from) has enough in the tank for this. Chargers over Steelers 27-19. Don\u2019t even ask me why, but Philadelphia is either way up or way down this year. I think they\u2019re due for an up week so I\u2019ll go with the upset and pick the Eagles over the Vikings 20-16. The Jets have Sam Darnold back but there\u2019s a lot more broken in that offense than just using a literally fourth string QB last week. Dallas may look weak, but they\u2019re good enough for this matchup. Cowboys over Jets 24-14.\n\nLet\u2019s take on four more games:\n\nEd:\n\nTexans at Chiefs (1 pm, CBS): Suddenly Patrick Mahomes and KC look vulnerable after last week\u2019s throttling by the Colts. The Texans have a weaker pass defense, though, and Mahomes will have made the necessary adjustments. Kansas City over Houston 30-23.\n\nSuddenly Patrick Mahomes and KC look vulnerable after last week\u2019s throttling by the Colts.

It\u2019s pretty unusual to have two undefeated teams meet up in week 6, but maybe even more unusual to have two skunked teams showing up this week. In a case like this, I\u2019d normally lean toward the home team, but Miami is scoring only 6.5 points per game \u2014 and giving up 40.8 PPG. The Redskins may be bad, but they\u2019re not that bad. Washington over Miami 22-10.\n\nWhy pick this game?

The Redskins may be bad, but they\u2019re not that bad. 49ers at Rams (4:05 pm, Fox): Speaking of looking vulnerable, the Rams suddenly have problems. They have lost their last two games and won\u2019t have RB Todd Gurley today to take on the undefeated 49ers. San Francisco\u2019s defense is already second in the league overall and only gives up 14.8 PPG. San Francisco over LAR 27-17.\n\nSpeaking of looking vulnerable, the Rams suddenly have problems.

Lions at Packers (MNF, 8:15 pm, ESPN): This should be an excellent defensive battle between division rivals, but home field advantage will make the difference. Green Bay over Detroit 24-17.\n\nJazz:", "description": "Welcome to the big leagues, kid.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hodges.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
