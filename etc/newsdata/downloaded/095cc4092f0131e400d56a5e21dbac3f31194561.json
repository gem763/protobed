After requesting that I stay, they graciously obliged. The opportunities afforded this guy from small town Mississippi have been many,\u201d Smith said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an honor and a privilege to report the news each day to our loyal audience in context and with perspective, without fear or favor. I\u2019ve worked with the most talented, dedicated and focused professionals I know and I\u2019m proud to have anchored their work each day\u2014I will deeply miss them.\u201d\n\nSmith was among Fox\u2019s first hires upon launching in 1996 and he became the network\u2019s signature daytime newsman, often acting as the anchor to enter other broadcasts to helm coverage of breaking news like the 2015 Paris attacks and the 2014 riots in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\n\u201cEven in our currently polarized nation, it\u2019s my hope that the facts will win the day,\u201d Smith said as he signed off his final broadcast. \u201cThat the truth will always matter, that journalism and journalists will thrive.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Jay Wallace, president and executive editor of Fox News Media, said, \u201cShep is one of the premier newscasters of his generation and his extraordinary body of work is among the finest journalism in the industry.\u201d He added: \u201cWhile this day is especially difficult as his former producer, we respect his decision and are deeply grateful for his immense contributions to the entire network.\u201d\n\nThroughout the Trump era, Smith took on a \u201crogue\u201d role at the network as Fox News became overtly pro-Trump in its commentary and news coverage. In many instances, as documented by The Daily Beast, Smith even fact-checked the right-wing conspiratorial musings of his own colleagues, resulting in not-so-subtle sparring with Fox stars like Sean Hannity.\n\nAs a result, Smith has prompted backlash from the president and many of the network\u2019s viewers, who overwhelmingly tune in to the channel\u2019s conservative programming.\n\nTrump has repeatedly whined about the anchor on Twitter, claiming he changes the channel when Smith\u2019s show\u2014which broadcasts in the middle of the workday\u2014comes on the air. \u201cWatching Fake News CNN is better than watching Shepard Smith, the lowest rated show on @FoxNews,\u201d the president wrote earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThe decision to leave was Shep\u2019s and his alone\u2014he will be taking an extended period of time off to be with his family,\u201d the anchor\u2019s spokesman said later Friday. \u201cFollowing that \u2013 who knows \u2013 he is not retiring.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Smith publicly clashed with Tucker Carlson, criticizing the Fox News primetime host for failing to defend their colleague Judge Andrew Napolitano when he was called a \u201cfool\u201d by a guest on Carlson\u2019s show.\n\nVanity Fair\u2019s Gabe Sherman reported several days later that Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and network president Jay Wallace allegedly conveyed to Smith that if he did not stop attacking Carlson, he would be off the network. \u201cAt no time did anyone\u2014including anyone in management or a third party\u2014speak to Shepard Smith regarding this matter,\u201d a Fox News spokesperson said. \u201cAnything to the contrary is entirely false and wildly inaccurate.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his role as the network\u2019s consummate newsman and fact-checker, Smith cultivated a reputation for delivering unfiltered, decidedly un-Fox-like on-air banter. \u201cWe are America! We do not fucking torture!\u201d he once shouted during a 2009 digital show.\n\nPublicly and privately, some of Smith\u2019s Fox News colleagues reacted with disbelief at his departure.\n\n\u201cLike you, I\u2019m a little stunned and a little heartbroken,\u201d said Neil Cavuto, another target of Trump\u2019s ire, at the opening of his broadcast, which immediately followed Smith\u2019s sign-off. \u201cIt was a total shock today to find out he\u2019s leaving,\u201d fellow news anchor Bret Baier tweeted. \u201cHe anchored breaking news\u2014fast-moving events\u2014better than anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no room for news here anymore,\u201d a Fox News staffer told The Daily Beast, speaking anonymously for fear of reprisal.\n\nA Fox News spokesperson fired back at the anonymous staffer, saying, \u201ctell that to Jennifer Griffin whose report just went viral this week. Or Chris Wallace, Bret Baier, Bill Hemmer or Catherine Herridge who have all done outstanding journalism.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated throughout with new statements and reactions.", "description": "The news anchor was a frequent target of the president\u2019s ire because of his penchant for calling B.S. on his own network\u2019s pro-Trump spin.", "authors": ["Andrew Kirell", "Maxwell Tani", "Senior Editor", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570824275/191011-shep-smith-fox-hero_inqsuu", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
