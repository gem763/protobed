It was Standard Bank's decision to close more than 100 branches earlier this year that shocked Sasbo into action.\n\nBig business doesn\u2019t want a strike and Business Unity South Africa (Busa), the association of large business, is seeking this morning to interdict the action.\n\nThe country can not afford more job losses. The official unemployment rate already stands at more than 29% and with little economic reform, that is likely to worsen.\n\nThe UK has seen more than a third of its bank branches close since 2015 and hundreds more have reduced operating hours, according to consumer watchdog group Which.\n\nRoyal Bank of Scotland (RBS) closed almost three quarters, or 412, of its branches, while NatWest, which is also part of RBS, closed 638 branches, the highest number of any group in that market.\n\nThe UK branch network has reduced from 9,803 to 6,549 in four-and-a-half years and challenger banks are opening new branches at 1% of the rate of closures.\n\nIt\u2019s a trend that\u2019s likely to continue here, perhaps not as quickly but certainly the ease of using technology rather than battling queues is making the branch less relevant to bank customer's needs.\n\nNot only are jobs threatened, but poorer customers as well as the elderly, without access to technology, are likely to suffer as the banking revolution gathers pace.\n\nAs for the planned strike, if it goes ahead and customers are not affected beyond a few branch closures, the shift to electronic banking will accelerate. The strike will be just like turkeys voting for Christmas.\n\nBruce Whitfield is a multi-platform award-winning financial journalist and broadcaster.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Bruce Whitfield:", "description": "If Friday\u2019s big banking strike does go ahead, it will simply amplify the point that machines are the future of banking, more so than people.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8179/54e11427d3724f2dbac8922b7e8f81d0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
