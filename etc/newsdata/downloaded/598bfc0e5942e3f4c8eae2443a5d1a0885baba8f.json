The animal was seized at customs in Munich and placed in quarantine. Bieber did not retrieve the monkey, which was transferred to a local zoo.\n\nLater that year, his neighbours in Calabasas, California, accused him of speeding through the streets in his Ferrari, which he denied. He served probation in a criminal plea deal after egging a neighbour\u2019s house. He was also filmed urinating in a restaurant mop bucket while shouting: \u201cFuck Bill Clinton.\u201d Bieber is said to have apologised privately to Clinton.\n\nSign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras Read more\n\nIn his Instagram post, Bieber admitted to \u201cdoing pretty heavy drugs at 19 and [abusing] all of my relationships\u201d. Bieber wrote that he \u201cbecame resentful, disrespectful to women, and angry. I became distant to everyone who loved me and I was hiding behind a shell of a person that I had become.\u201d\n\nNow 25, Bieber credited the support of friends, his Christian faith and his marriage with helping to turn his life around. He married model Hailey Baldwin in 2018. Marriage, he said, has taught him \u201cpatience, trust, commitment, kindness, humility and all of the things it looks like to be a good man\u201d.\n\nIn 2017, Bieber took a break from the music industry, cancelling the final 14 dates of a world tour, saying: \u201cI want my mind, heart and soul to be sustainable.\u201d He recently sang on Ed Sheeran\u2019s single I Don\u2019t Care and a remix of Bad Guy by Billie Eilish.\n\n\u2022 In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and Papyrus can be contacted on 0800 068 4141.
