It\u2019s just evading the problem", "language": "en", "text": "The Som Dona hotel in Majorca opened its gleaming glass doors for the first time earlier this summer with sparkling white sunbeds, modern minimalist decor and one rule regarding occupants to make it stand out from the pack: absolutely no men.\n\nThe hotel boasts a pool, a spa, a roof-top terrace, healthy food options and is open to all women (and girls over 14) whether they are travelling solo, as a couple or in a group with other women.\n\nHowever, from the claim that the hotel\u2019s \u201cbold decoration is inspired by feminine features\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s painted white and pink \u2013 to the question on the website that asks \u201cDid you know that you can be wild, healthy, fun, beautiful, relaxed, adventurous, curious and social all at once?\u201d, this particular exercise in catering to women\u2019s needs feels less about really providing for what women might want and more about cashing in.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

No, her reasoning was down to the simple fact that the company saw a gap in the market following a customer survey \u2013 travel trends show that more women are choosing to travel alone or in same-sex groups.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It\u2019s not just the richest women that get their period. As things stand, the two other kinds of room available appear to be absolutely no different from any hotel I\u2019ve been in.\n\nAt the launch of a similar project, the ridiculously expensive women-only retreat, SuperShe island in Finland last year, founder Kristina Roth talked of how \u201cbeing on vacation with men can cause women to become sidetracked, whether it\u2019s to put on a swipe of lipstick or grab for a cover-up\u201d. It bloody does not. There are women who go on holiday and don\u2019t bother with make-up at all and there are those who love to wear lipstick. I\u2019m fairly sure their choice has got nothing to do with them \u201cbecoming sidetracked\u201d by the presence of a man.\n\nI get it; when a woman dons a swimsuit on holiday, the last thing they want is an unsolicited catcall or a wolf-whistle from some bloke who has knocked back one too many under the blistering Spanish sun. That isn\u2019t going to happen in a women-only environment.\n\nBut the problem won\u2019t go away just because we women are sequestered in an XX-chromosome-only space. And anyway, it\u2019s not just men who comment on women\u2019s appearance \u2013 I\u2019ve heard plenty of women making snarky remarks about others\u2019 sartorial decisions.\n\nYet my overriding feeling towards this phenomenon is one of sadness. The fact that fear of harassment from men is a deciding factor in choosing a holiday hotel shows that a lot needs to change \u2013 and it is men who need to do the changing. Fewer women would feel the need for these kinds of same-sex-only hotels if so.\n\nTo those who say, \u201cBut there are men\u2019s clubs! There always have been!\u201d I would respond that yes, there are men\u2019s clubs \u2013 and that\u2019s a huge part of the ongoing problem between men and women. The idea that we must retreat into gender groups to find understanding and empathy, and in order to be treated with respect, is sad and, frankly, only skirting around the problem.", "description": "The Som Dona hotel in Majorca opened its gleaming glass doors for the first time earlier this summer with sparkling white sunbeds, modern minimalist decor and one rule regarding occupants to make it stand out from the pack: absolutely no men.\u00a0 The hotel boasts a pool, a spa, a roof-top terrace, healthy food options and is open to all women (and girls over 14) whether they are", "authors": ["Lucie Mcinerney"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/28/15/women-only-hotel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
