Today one-fifth of children age 6 to 19 are clinically obese. \u201cConsumed from a young age, sugar consumption appears to have long-lasting effects, not just habitually but also physiologically,\u201d the researchers add.\n\nScientific studies have shown a link between infant and childhood obesity and higher consumption of sugars at the earliest ages \u2014 even while in gestation.\n\nThe pattern for poor diet is set early in life and the effects are cumulative, medical experts note.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, national consumption of added sugars such as high-fructose corn syrup rocketed from around 70 pounds per person per year in 1970 to almost 90 pounds by 2000. The researchers note this is equal to an average of extra 100 calories per person per day.\n\nThat adds up to 36,500 calories a year \u2014 enough to add about 10 pounds in fat to the human body, experts note.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about body-mass index. Type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease and hypertension are all now being seen among children for the first time, warned a recent paper in the medical journal Pediatric Obesity.\n\nThese have all been associated with the so-called \u201cWestern Diet,\u201d high in refined carbohydrates and especially industrial sweeteners. In one study, children\u2019s\u2019 health measures improved almost immediately when researchers replaced some of the sugars in their diet with starches like potatoes \u2014 even when the total amount of calories stayed the same.\n\n\u201cWe agree people should be empowered to make informed choices when it comes to enjoying their favorite treats \u2014 at Halloween and all throughout the year,\u201d Christopher Gindelsperger, spokesman for the National Confectioners\u2019 Association, told MarketWatch.\n\nChocolate and candy companies \u201chave come together to help people manage their sugar intake,\u201d he said. Examples, he said, include more options in smaller, 200 calories or less pack sizes and clear front-of-pack calorie labels.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: The FDA wants to stop you from buying candy from your office vending machine\n\nIn fact, the sugared beverages that children drink every day are a bigger problem than Halloween, said Alex Bentley, one of the co-authors on the University of Tennessee research.\n\n\u201cA leading sweet-tea brand might have about 42 grams of sugar in the bottle \u2014 that\u2019s the equivalent of a dozen Tootsie rolls,\u201d he says. \u201cImagine the effects of drinking one bottle with every meal, that\u2019s like eating three dozen Tootsie rolls every day. So I\u2019m not so worried about Halloween by comparison.\u201d", "description": "Trick or Type 2 diabetes?", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU259_arends_ZG_20191029154727.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
