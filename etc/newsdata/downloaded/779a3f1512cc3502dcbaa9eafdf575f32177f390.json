Arguably, something is not right here. The U.S. ISM report proved that and I really wonder when the Fed's going to stop pretending that everything is okay,\" he added.\n\nU.S. manufacturing contracted at the fastest pace in more than a decade in September, making the United States the latest country to suffer a manufacturing downturn amid a trade war between Washington and Beijing. analysts, however, say the dollar's higher yield and the relative strength of the U.S. economy should make its setback temporary. Non-farm payrolls data due on Friday should give more insight into the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nIn morning trading, the dollar fell 0.3% against the yen to 107.39 yen , reflecting investor demand for safer assets after the manufacturing data heightened concerns about the health of the global economy.\n\nThe euro rose 0.1% against the dollar to $1.0944 but was above Tuesday's two-year low of $1.0879.\n\nThe , which measures the greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, was little changed at 99.13 after reaching 99.667 on Tuesday, a 29-month peak, before the manufacturing data was released.\n\nMichael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets in London said weakness in U.S. manufacturing would have to spill over into services before it had much impact on monetary policy and the outlook for the dollar.\n\nElsewhere, the Australian dollar fell 0.2% to US$0.6696 AUD=D3 , its weakest since early 2009, as investors sold currencies linked to the outlook of the global economy. The Aussie fell to a fresh 10-year trough on Wednesday after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates to a record low on Tuesday. pound was down 0.1% at $1.2290 GBP=D3 amid doubt over whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson's final Brexit offer to the European Union would be well-received by Brussels. bid prices at 10:19AM (1419 GMT) Description\n\nU.S. Close Pct Change\n\nYTD Pct\n\nHigh Bid\n\nLow Bid\n\nPrevious\n\nChange\n\nSession\n\nEuro/Dollar\n\n$1.0943\n\n$1.0930\n\n+0.12%\n\n-4.57%\n\n+1.0949\n\n+1.0905 Dollar/Yen\n\n107.4500\n\n107.7400\n\n-0.27%\n\n-2.56%\n\n+107.8900 +107.3700 Euro/Yen\n\nEURJPY=\n\n117.60\n\n117.77\n\n-0.14%\n\n-6.83%\n\n+118.0000 +117.3800 Dollar/Swiss\n\n0.9996\n\n0.9933\n\n+0.63%\n\n+1.84%\n\n+1.0025\n\n+0.9922 Sterling/Dollar GBP=\n\n1.2280\n\n1.2301\n\n-0.17%\n\n-3.74%\n\n+1.2311\n\n+1.2228 Dollar/Canadian CAD=\n\n1.3284\n\n1.3218\n\n+0.50%\n\n-2.60%\n\n+1.3284\n\n+1.3205 Australian/Doll AUD=\n\n0.6696\n\n0.6702\n\n-0.09%\n\n-5.01%\n\n+0.6718\n\n+0.6672 ar\n\nEuro/Swiss\n\nEURCHF=\n\n1.0940\n\n1.0857\n\n+0.76%\n\n-2.79%\n\n+1.0953\n\n+1.0854 Euro/Sterling\n\nEURGBP=\n\n0.8910\n\n0.8884\n\n+0.29%\n\n-0.83%\n\n+0.8924\n\n+0.8883 NZ\n\n0.6254\n\n0.6244\n\n+0.16%\n\n-6.89%\n\n+0.6257\n\n+0.6220 Dollar/Dollar\n\nDollar/Norway\n\n9.1407\n\n9.1236\n\n+0.19%\n\n+5.82%\n\n+9.1610\n\n+9.1159 Euro/Norway\n\nEURNOK=\n\n10.0049\n\n9.9752\n\n+0.30%\n\n+1.00%\n\n+10.0135\n\n+9.9684 Dollar/Sweden\n\n9.8997\n\n9.8768\n\n+0.32%\n\n+10.44%\n\n+9.9205\n\n+9.8573 Euro/Sweden\n\nEURSEK=\n\n10.8354\n\n10.8006\n\n+0.32%\n\n+5.57%\n\n+10.8400\n\n+10.7807\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/2opJuzd\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "FOREX-Dollar falls vs yen, euro, tracking U.S. stocks, yields", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA6K0IO_L.jpg"}
