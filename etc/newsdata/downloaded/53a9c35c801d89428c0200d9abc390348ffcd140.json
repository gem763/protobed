Without a brick and mortar location in Canada, many fans of the American retailer, like Church, rely on Everlane\u2019s online store and pay shipping and duty on international orders.\n\nALSO SEE: #TrendOnTrial: What is brow lamination\u2014and is it worth it?\n\nWhen the Vancouver-based founder of Nettle\u2019s Tale, a size inclusive swimwear line, headed to her local Nordstrom to check out the temporary pop-up, she was disheartened to find that despite carrying up to a size 20 online, the Everlane pop-up only carried up to a size 12 in store.\n\nJulia Church.

More\n\nAlthough she said she\u2019s a customer and fan of the brand\u2019s commitment to transparency and sustainability, Church reportedly tried to contact Everlane via email to express her frustrations. When no contact information for the pop-up could be found, she turned to Instagram stories to share her disappointment.\n\nALSO SEE: Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau celebrates Liberal win in eco-friendly $249 dress\n\n\u201cBig fail Everlane,\u201d Church said. \u201cWhen you offer up to a certain size and you announce that you\u2019re offering that size, and then you don\u2019t have over a size 12 available at your pop-up, you\u2019ve got your size 16, size 18, 20 women going to that pop up saying, \u2018Hey do you have anything over a size 12 here?\u2019 You have to make eye contact with a complete stranger as they look into your eyes and they\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry we don\u2019t have over a size 12 here.\u2019\u201d\n\nImage via Everlane. More\n\nChurch went on to explain how \u201cdemoralizing\u201d it can be for both parties involved, with staff offering alternatives that make the shopper uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cThey start to announce, \u2018Try this piece on - it\u2019s extra roomy, it runs big.\u2019 And then they wait outside of the change room,\u201d She continued. \u201cI\u2019m not going to come out of the change room, I\u2019m trying to gauge my size here and I can\u2019t get any of the pants done up. I made an evening of this and now I feel really bad about myself when you actually offer my size. You could have just had it at your pop-up so I could have tried it on and had a good experience.\u201d\n\nALSO SEE: 'It was time to stop hiding': How shaving her head helped this blogger embrace her 'inner warrior'\n\nChurch left Nordstrom\u2019s empty handed but said she still went home to place an online order from Everlane. She went on to credit blogger Shannon Buckley for helping women who are over a size 12 feel comfortable shopping online sharing her measurements and try-on hauls with her more than 50,000 Instagram followers.\n\nStory continues", "description": "\"Now I feel really bad about myself when you actually offer my size.\"", "authors": ["Elizabeth Di Filippo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Zsrxi60pZCIpuBPRFTYRsg--~B/aD03MDA7dz0xMzAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/3b5cd8e0-f4fb-11e9-bfb9-45b5278da349", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
