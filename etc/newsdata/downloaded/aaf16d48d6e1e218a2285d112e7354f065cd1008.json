Ladd went a step farther in her complaint before the commission during Tuesday\u2019s meeting in downtown Los Angeles, claiming gender discrimination factored into the decision to wave off the fight, implying Dean would have let the bout continue if it was a men\u2019s matchup.\n\nDean, who was present at the hearing, adamantly denied gender played a role in the decision, and three out of the five commissioners agreed, as the appeal was denied on a 3-2 vote.\n\nThe vote was divided along gender lines, with John Carvelli, Luis Ayala and Vernon Williams voting against the appeal, and Martha Shen-Urquidez and Mary Lehman voting for.\n\nDe Randamie will next fight Amanda Nunes for the bantamweight championship at UFC 245 in Las Vegas. Ladd will fight Yana Kunitskaya at UFC on ESPN 7.", "description": "Germaine de Randamie's 16-second victory over Aspen Ladd was upheld Tuesday.", "authors": ["Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "George Garcia"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/germaine-de-randamie-aspen-ladd-ufc-on-espn-plus-13-9.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
