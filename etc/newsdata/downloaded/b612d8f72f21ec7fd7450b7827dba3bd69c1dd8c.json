The Surface Duo features two 5.6-inch displays that can rotate 360 degrees, allowing it to be fully unfolded as a miniature 8.3-inch tablet.\n\nThat just happened at the #MicrosoftEvent.

The version of Android on offer here looks heavily skinned, too, to resemble the Windows 10X operating system that the larger Surface Neo runs.\n\nAccording to Wired, the Surface Duo is powered by a Snapdragon 855 processor, but elements of the design haven\u2019t been finalized yet \u2014 like whether it\u2019ll feature a rear camera at all.\n\nAnd while Microsoft\u2019s chief product officer Panos Panay seemed loath to call the Surface Duo a \u201cphone\u201d onstage, the announcement is a big one for Microsoft, marking the company\u2019s return to the smartphone space for the first time since the death of the Windows Phone platform back in 2017.\n\nLike the Neo, today\u2019s look at the Surface Duo is an early preview. The device won\u2019t be out until holiday 2020, but Microsoft wants to give developers plenty of time to start building apps for the new hardware.", "description": "Microsoft had one last surprise at its Surface event: a foldable Surface Duo phone that runs Android.
