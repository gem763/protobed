(Liam Christy/Facebook)\n\nLast month, the Union of B.C. Municipalities passed a resolution to lower the voting age , a move that requires a change to the province's voting legislation.\n\nGreen Party Leader Elizabeth May and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh have signalled support for a change at the federal level. Canada's Chief Electoral Officer St\u00e9phane Perrault told CBC News last year that it was an idea \"worth considering.\"\n\nI think it's a good idea. - Paul Howe, political science professor at University of New Brunswick\n\nPaul Howe, a University of New Brunswick political science professor, said, \"I think it's a good idea.\"\n\nThe political scientist's research suggested that not only will 16- and 17-year-olds head to the polls if allowed, it could reduce political apathy among young people.\n\nVoting data shows young Canadians voting less than the same age group did in previous generations. Howe worries that could mean turnout will continue to drop as today's young voters age.\n\nHigh school political engagement key\n\nIn his book, Citizens Adrift: The Democratic Disengagement of Young Canadians, Howe examined the causes behind declining young voter turnout.\n\nOne was simply a lack of interest and knowledge about politics.\n\nHowe said that not only is civics education lacking, but a greater variety of media options have changed what information young Canadians consume.\n\n\"Younger people are maybe drifting away from paying close attention to news and public affairs,\" he said.\n\nThe other is a \"culture shift towards a more individualized society.\" That, Howe said, has eroded the idea that one needs to be civically engaged.\n\nWhether or not the voting age changes, Howe said schools need to better engage future voters by hosting mock elections and helping register eligible students to vote.\n\nWhile Elections Canada will target new voters on university and college campuses, Howe's research suggested it's those that don't attend post-secondary education who may need a nudge toward the ballot box.\n\n\"If you take it back to the high school level, now you're getting pretty much everyone.\"\n\nNot a popular idea with older Canadians\n\nPollster David Coletto, CEO of Abacus Data, said research suggests that lowering the voting age could mean greater turnout in the future by forming the habit early.\n\nBut not all Canadians are on board with that idea, he said.\n\n\"I don't think it's naturally a very popular idea, frankly,\" he told Cross Country Checkup.\n\n\"It's one that a lot of people, especially older Canadians, would look at and say, 'I'm not sure 16- and 17-year-olds are ready to participate.'\"\n\nDavid Coletto, CEO of Abacus Data, says research suggests that engaging voters earlier than 18 could encourage voting later in life. (CBC)\n\nUniversity student Christy said that while not all 16-year-olds have an interest in voting, many are equipped to make an informed decision.\n\nWhen it comes to things like life experience, the concentration of the amount of knowledge we can get \u2026 whether it just be in school, or through access to the internet, is just absolutely insane. - Liam Christy, youth vote advocate\n\n\"When it comes to things like life experience, the concentration of the amount of knowledge we can get \u2026 whether it just be in school, or through access to the internet, is just absolutely insane,\" he told McCue.\n\nThe Kelowna, B.C., student will turn 18 in December, missing this year's election by just a few weeks.\n\nPointing to countries like Scotland and Austria, which have lowered their minimum voting age to 16, Christy said a change in Canada is \"more probable than people think.\"\n\n\"The question is whether it will be soon enough for us to cast our votes on important matters that are going to affect us for the rest of our lives and our children's lives.\"", "description": "Young Canadians are voting less than previous generations did, but one expert says engaging them early could change that.
