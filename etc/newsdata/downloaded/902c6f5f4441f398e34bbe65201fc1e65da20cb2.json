REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\n\u201cThis is different in some sense because it was chlorine ... but know that President Trump has been pretty vigorous in protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons,\u201d Pompeo said, said declining to say what the U.S. response could be.\n\nPompeo said Washington had also added sanctions on two Russian entities for providing fuel to the Syrian government. Russia supports Assad in the more than eight-year-long Syrian war.\n\nAsked whether Paris had formed the same conclusions as Washington, French officials in New York declined to comment.", "description": "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday that the United States had concluded the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria had used chlorine as a chemical weapon in an attack in May during a battle with insurgents in Idlib.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434209146&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1F0", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
