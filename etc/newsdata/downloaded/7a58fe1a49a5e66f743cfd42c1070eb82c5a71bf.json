Unfortunately, that duck looks unlikely to be broken at Japan 2019.\n\nIndeed, there are rumblings that the French may already be looking forward to their home World Cup in 2023, where a young squad may be better equipped for a tilt at glory. Jacques Brunel has selected a squad full of promise, with prodigious tighthead prop Demba Bamba, devastating Fijian-born winger Alivereti Raka and playmaking fly-half Romain Ntamack (whose father Emile was part of the second and third-placed sides in 1999 and 1995 respectively) just three that catch the eye.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that too much of the squad has too little experience, particularly in key areas. Ntamack, likely the first-choice fly-half for the World Cup, was not a starter for Toulouse come the sharp end of the Top 14, and was generally selected at inside centre, anyway.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThere are reasons for optimism, of course, not least the successes of that Toulouse side and Clermont Auvergne, the two clubs from which France\u2019s foundations will be built. Antoine Dupont is such a danger at nine and Damian Penaud\u2019s continued evolution from error-prone outside centre into rangy running try-scorer on the wing has added further threat to a backline that, if Wesley Fofana stays fit and Ntamack finds his international footing, is a rival to any at the tournament.\n\nEngland appear to be beyond France\u2019s capabilities and should take Pool D, but Argentina are not in a dissimilar phase to Brunel\u2019s side, and that opening pool game looks a corker that could decide second place in the group. It is perhaps clich\u00e9d to say that it depends on what French team turns up, but this iteration have rekindled the entertainingly mercurial nature of the sides which have gone before, and they genuinely can beat anyone on their day.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Dragged back into the international arena after Guy Noves\u2019 departure in 2017, Brunel\u2019s tenure has thus far been a poor one, with a first ever defeat to Fiji last autumn and consecutive poor Six Nations campaigns.\n\nHe has retained the backing of French rugby president Bernard Laporte, perhaps benefiting from his time as France\u2019s forward coach working under Laporte between 2001 and 2007. With Fabien Galthie teed up for taking over after the World Cup, Brunel will be looking to finish strongly in what might be, at 65 years old, his final major coaching role.\n\nKey Player\n\nGuilhem Guirado. Guirado leads from the front and very rarely puts a foot wrong in a French jersey. The hooker is an accurate dart-thrower at the lineout, solid scrummager and tireless worker in open play, and while there may be more naturally gifted hookers at the tournament, no-one will graft quite as much as Guirado.\n\nWith France relatively inexperienced, particularly at key positions like nine and ten, Guirado\u2019s leadership will be vital.\n\nPast Record\n\nAustralia/New Zealand 1987 \u2013 runners-up\n\nEurope 1991 \u2013 quarter-finalists (three wins)\n\nSouth Africa 1995 \u2013 third place\n\nWales 1999 \u2013 runners-up\n\nAustralia 2003 \u2013 fourth place\n\nFrance 2007 - fourth place\n\nNew Zealand 2011 - runners-up\n\nEngland 2015 \u2013 quarter-finalists (three wins)\n\nPrediction\n\nFrance fail to recover from a first game loss to Argentina, and despite beating the USA and Tonga are eliminated with a defeat against England.\n\nFixtures\n\nSaturday 21 September \u2013 France vs Argentina (8.15am), Tokyo\n\nWednesday 2 October \u2013 France vs USA (8.45am), Fukuoka\n\nSunday 6 October \u2013 France vs Tonga (8.45am), Kumamoto\n\nSaturday 12 October \u2013 England vs France (9.15am), Yokohama\n\nOdds\n\nFrance to win the World Cup: 25/1", "description": "France\u00a0have only twice failed to make the Rugby World Cup semi-finals, but have never won the competition.
