Trump tweeted that vehicles would be \u201cfar less expensive\u201d and \u201csubstantially SAFER\u201d - claims California officials rejected.\n\nTrump, who is in California this week, urged automakers to back the action, which could also eliminate electric vehicle mandates in a dozen states that follow California\u2019s regulatory lead.\n\nThe announcement will not immediately lead to revised emissions requirements, but the Trump administration plans to announce this autumn a separate rule to dramatically roll back Obama-era fuel-efficiency standards agreed with California, advancing a multipronged attack on the state\u2019s efforts to reshape the mix of vehicles driven by Americans.\n\n\u201cAutomakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to California, you will be out of business,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nSo far, none have publicly supported revocation of California\u2019s authority.\n\nThe Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Ford Motor Co and others, declined to take a position on Trump\u2019s revocation of California\u2019s waiver, saying automakers will review the decision \u201cto get the full picture of how this impacts automakers, our workers and our customers.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday morning, California Governor Gavin Newsom, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and Mary Nichols, the state\u2019s top clean air regulator, appeared at a news conference in Sacramento and denounced Trump\u2019s action as a \u201cpolitical vendetta\u201d that risks damage to the climate and public health and would leave the U.S. auto industry behind in a global race to develop electric vehicle technology.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Transportation Department plan to announce on Thursday that the government is revoking an EPA waiver California received in 2013 to set state emissions rules and will hold a news conference to discuss the decision.\n\nNewsom, Becerra and Nichols said the state will go to court to challenge the administration\u2019s action once it is official.\n\n\u201cThis is the fight of a lifetime for us,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cWe have to win this and I believe we will.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s action came on the same day teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg was addressing the U.S. Congress and urging lawmakers to treat climate change \u201cas the existential crisis it is.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Trump\u2019s move, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday he was opposed to it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m strongly in favor of a decentralized approach to these measures and I\u2019m strongly against any reduction of that decentralization,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI think it\u2019s important - and this is true for many countries in the world - that cities and states and regions have a capacity to develop all positive measures in relation to climate action.\u201d\n\nPOLITICAL BATTLE\n\nThe fight over highly technical emissions rules will play out in the political arena where the issues are more visceral.\n\nTrump and other administration officials have framed their decision as a move to protect consumers from regulatory mandates that would drive up the cost of vehicles, and force heartland truck owners to pay more for their vehicles to subsidize the sale of money-losing electric cars to wealthy coastal dwellers.\n\nCalifornia officials, Democratic presidential candidates and environmental groups countered that Trump\u2019s action benefits only the oil industry.\n\nSierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said the environmental group would file a lawsuit to challenge the move, calling it \u201cnothing more than pure vindictiveness from an administration set on giving Big Oil a polluting pass at the expense of our climate and the well-being of American families.\u201d\n\nAmericans will spend more on gassing up less efficient vehicles than they will save if new vehicle prices are kept down, California officials said. Nichols said Trump\u2019s action threatened more asthma and more premature deaths from dirty air.\n\nAutomakers are caught in the middle. While worried that California\u2019s electric vehicle mandates will be costly, global automakers have little choice but to develop battery electric cars and trucks because Europe and China are pushing ahead with rules requiring them.\n\n\u201cEvery single one of these companies knows where the consumer is going and where the world is going ... the elimination of the internal combustion engine,\u201d Newsom said.\n\nThe auto emissions battle is just one front in a widening battle between the Trump administration and California\u2019s Democratic administration. The White House and the leaders of the largest U.S. state by population have also locked horns over high-speed rail funding, building a border wall and immigration regulations.\n\nTrump has also moved to roll back other Obama-era climate change regulations California\u2019s leaders support.\n\nUnder Trump, federal regulators have backed freezing emissions requirements for new cars and trucks at 2020 levels through 2026. Administration officials say the final regulation will include a modest boost in annual efficiency requirements but far less than what the Obama administration set in 2012. At the time, California agreed to adopt the Obama rules rather than set its own standards.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with California's then-Governor-elect Gavin Newsom (L) after greeting then-Governor Jerry Brown (C) upon arriving at Beale Air Force Base, California, U.S., November 17, 2018.
