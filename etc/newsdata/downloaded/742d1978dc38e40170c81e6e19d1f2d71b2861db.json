But as soon as we are shown to our stateroom and read the first daily bulletin I get the picture.\n\nPushing the boat out: Beautiful Basel sits on the Rhine\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to be looked after. Few decisions to be made, no worries about transport, courteous, well-trained staff to answer every need.\n\nAt each new daily mooring, there is an included tour and one or two optional ones (you pay extra), but there\u2019s nothing to stop you staying on the boat, browsing the excellent small library, eating good food and letting the Rhine send you to sleep.\n\nI like going to the huge dining room and just joining a table. We bond with a young American couple called John and Beth. One night, pretty Beth and I confide in each other, helped by a few Riesling-induced tears and hugs.\n\nAfter-dinner drinks in the lounge, with music playing, can forge instant friendships. On one occasion, we plonk ourselves on a table with some lovely Brits.\n\n\u2018You look just like that lady from the Daily Mail,\u2019 one of them says. Post-cruise they have become friends. There are eight people travelling alone on our ship, the Aruna, and I understand why. This is a safe, undemanding holiday with new people to talk to at meals and excursions. It couldn\u2019t be more friendly. Yes, most of us are middle-aged, but there\u2019s a group of passengers in their 30s too \u2014 like my new chum Beth.\n\nThe first stop is at the hugely-popular Kinderdijk windmills in the Netherlands. We pile into one of the historic pumping machines \u2014 a rather claustrophobic experience.\n\nBel Mooney travelled with Viking Cruises on a getaway from Basel to Amsterdam\n\nWhole families lived in the tall, iconic buildings, under the constant clank of the blades. No wonder they look so gaunt and miserable in old photographs on the walls.\n\nThis excursion confirms the routine. After breakfast you\u2019re whisked away in different groups on coaches, each with a guide, to that day\u2019s venue \u2014 and, after sightseeing, back to the ship. If the guide is good, so much the better.\n\nThe one we have next day in Cologne is big on cosy platitudes and low on information, although, of course, the lordly cathedral speaks for itself. We\u2019d be better off skipping the organised stuff and wandering on our own.\n\nA tip: don\u2019t be afraid of being independent. Being shepherded in a group isn\u2019t for me \u2014 and there\u2019s plenty of it on a cruise. But at a UNESCO World Heritage Site such as Marksburg castle you have to have a guided tour \u2014 and it\u2019s worthwhile.\n\nBel, pictured above, aboard a Viking ship\n\nGermans call their beautiful river Father Rhine: 764 miles of waterway rising in the Alps and passing through Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, France and the Netherlands before joining the North Sea at Rotterdam.\n\nOn one sunny afternoon of cruising through the magnificent scenery of the Middle Rhine we see vineyards sloping precipitously down the river banks, castle after ruined castle on hilltops, and a changing panorama of pretty, peaceful villages along the edge of the mighty river \u2014 which transports goods as well as holidaymakers. Hearing the well-judged commentary as we loll on deck, cold beer in hand, fulfils all my imaginings.\n\nWe absolutely love the atmospheric wine tasting and dinner in Eberbach monastery; buy festive trinkets in Heidelberg\u2019s famous Christmas shop, and are fascinated to explore Strasbourg with a young guide clearly proud of her magnificent city \u2014 surely one of the prettiest places in Europe, with a cathedral to overawe even the most experienced churchaholic like me.\n\nHere on display is all the might of EU institutions, too \u2014 and I find out that evening that our vessel is staffed by 13 different nationalities. Together with the fascinating history of conflict over Alsace (and with our own national difficulties never far from the mind), this is thought-provoking.\n\nMy favourite stop proves to be one of the optional visits \u2014 the medieval town of Colmar \u2014 an enchanting, unspoilt town which happens to contain one of the world\u2019s greatest works of art, the German artist Grunewald\u2019s Isenheim altarpiece, from the early 16th century.\n\nIt\u2019s good to do some research before you go on a well-organised cruise \u2014 and next time I\u2019d plan what to skip \u2014 like the hideously touristy Black Forest cuckoo clocks.\n\nOn the other hand, many of the Americans loved that diversion. A cruise has to cater for all tastes \u2014 and that must explain why this sort of holiday is fast becoming the most popular of them all.", "description": "The Daily Mail's Bel Mooney travelled with Viking Cruises on a getaway from Basel to Amsterdam.
