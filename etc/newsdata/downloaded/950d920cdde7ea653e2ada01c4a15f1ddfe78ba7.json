Bush, ordered both sides to brief the court on potential next steps. The decision could also be appealed to a higher court.\n\n\u201cThe watch list\u2019s arbitrary criteria has long enabled the government to target Muslims based on their faith and then build a secretive network map of their associations,\u201d said one of the CAIR trial attorneys, Carolyn Homer. \u201cToday, the government\u2019s unlawful surveillance of the Muslim community has begun to be curtailed.\u201d\n\nThe FBI didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment, but government lawyers have previously urged the judge to dismiss the case.\n\n\u201c There is no evidence, or contention, that any of these plaintiffs satisfy the definition of a \u2018known terrorist. \u201d \u2014U.S. District Judge Anthony Trenga\n\nThe watch list \u201callows U.S. authorities to identify known and suspected terrorists seeking to board aircraft, enter the country, or engage in other potentially threatening activity,\u201d attorneys representing the government wrote in one brief, adding: \u201cTerrorism remains a grave and persistent threat to our national security and civil aviation.\u201d\n\nThe Terrorist Screening Database was created in 2003 as part of a directive to consolidate the government\u2019s terrorism-related watch lists. It contains the biometric and biographical data of 1.2 million individuals\u2014including the data of about 4,600 American citizens\u2014as of 2017. The better-known \u201cno-fly\u201d list is a smaller subset of the overall Terrorist Screening Database, prohibiting anyone listed from boarding a civilian aircraft.\n\nIndividuals are placed in the database by U.S. or foreign government agencies, based on the \u201creasonable suspicion that the individual is engaged, has been engaged or intends to engage, in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid or in furtherance of, or related to, terrorism or terrorist activities,\u201d according to government documents on the program.\n\nThe government doesn\u2019t confirm or deny the inclusion of people on the list, but it does allow people who believe they are included to challenge their status through the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Traveler Redress Inquiry Program. The government says it doesn\u2019t place people on the list solely based on race, ethnicity, religion or First Amendment-protected free speech.\n\nAll told, about 18,000 federal, state, and local law-enforcement agencies, more than 500 private organizations and more than 60 foreign governments have access to the database.\n\nUnlike the no-fly list, inclusion in the Terrorist Screening Database doesn\u2019t preclude someone from boarding an airplane, but travel may trigger additional security measures. Several of the plaintiffs reported being detained repeatedly while trying to board an aircraft or cross international borders\u2014prompting the lawsuit. None believe they are on the no-fly list but all say they have circumstantial evidence that they are included in the larger Terrorist Screening Database.\n\nOne plaintiff, Anas Elhady, an American Muslim who lives in Michigan, reported several incidents of hourslong detentions while trying to cross into the U.S. According to the complaint, one U.S. Customs agent told him: \u201cAre you serious? Someone like you should have stopped crossing the border by now.\u201d\n\nThe constitutionality of the smaller, more restrictive no-fly list has been challenged with some success in the past. In 2015, the Department of Homeland Security began telling American citizens and permanent residents who were barred from flights over security concerns how they ended up on the no-fly list and gave them a chance to contest the designation.\n\nThe move came in response to a series of lawsuits filed on behalf of Americans who were denied the ability to board planes because they ended up on the list. Several federal judges, including Judge Trenga, have declared that some of the no-fly list procedure violates due-process rights.\n\nWrite to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com", "description": "A federal judge declared that the Terrorist Screening Database is unconstitutional in its current form, reopening the legal debate about a key national security tool used by thousands of government agencies world-wide.", "authors": ["Byron Tau", "Byron.Tau Wsj.Com", "U.S. District Judge Anthony Trenga"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104111/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
