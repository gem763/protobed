It\u2019s a Massive Plot.", "language": "en", "text": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer. Photos: Getty Images\n\nOn July 25, President Trump held a phone call in which he repeatedly leaned on Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and Paul Manafort\u2019s prosecutors. The episode is so blatantly inappropriate even Trump\u2019s most fervent apologists are, with a few exceptions, having trouble defending it. What they are trying to do, instead, is define this phone call as the entire scandal. Trump emphasizes that he \u201cdidn\u2019t specifically mention the explicit quid pro quo\u201d of military aid in return for the investigation.\n\nThat is true, as far as it goes. The quid pro quo in the call, though perfectly apparent, is mostly implicit. But the real trick in Trump\u2019s defense is framing the call as the entire scandal. The scandal is much more than that. The call is a snapshot, a moment in time in a months-long campaign that put American policy toward Ukraine at the disposal of Trump\u2019s personal interests and reelection campaign.\n\nLast spring, Rudy Giuliani was openly pressuring Kiev to investigate Joe Biden. Giuliani told the New York Times, \u201cWe\u2019re meddling in an investigation \u2026 because that information will be very, very helpful to my client.\u201d The key word there was \u201cwe\u2019re.\u201d The first-person plural indicated Giuliani was not carrying out this mission alone. A series of reports have revealed how many other government officials were involved in the scheme.\n\nWhen Trump ordered military aid to Ukraine to be frozen, he went through his chief of staff and budget director Mick Mulvaney. Congress had passed the aid, and Ukraine was under military attack from Russia, a fact that made the halting of the assistance worrisome to numerous officials in two branches of government. As the Times reported, lawmakers and State Department staffers were asking why the money hadn\u2019t gone through.\n\nThey were given cover stories: Lawmakers \u201cwere first told the assistance was being reviewed to determine whether it was in the best interest of foreign policy,\u201d the Times reported this week. \u201cOther administration officials said, without detail, there was a review on corruption in Ukraine, according to current and former officials. Then, as August drew to a close, other officials told lawmakers they were trying to gauge the effectiveness of the aid, a claim that struck congressional aides as odd.\u201d\n\nLots of officials were involved in disseminating these cover stories to hide the fact that Trump held back the aid to leverage Ukraine to investigate Biden. One of them was Mike Pence, who told some confused officials that the aid was being held up \u201cbased on concerns from the White House about \u2018issues of corruption.\u2019\u201d Pence knew perfectly well what this really meant \u2014 asked point blank if the aid was being held up over Ukraine\u2019s failure to investigate Biden, he replied \u201cas President Trump had me make clear, we have great concerns about issues of corruption.\u201d In other words, yes, Ukraine needed to investigate Biden if it wanted the money.\n\nGiuliani, though is the central figure. He has employed very little subterfuge. Giuliani told the Washington Post he kept Trump informed of his work in Ukraine for months, and declared, \u201cMy narrow interest is for the benefit of my client.\u201d The apparent reason for his candor was to make it known to Ukraine that he was not a goofy cable-television blatherer but the president\u2019s designated representative for Ukraine policy. If Ukraine wanted to get anything done, it had to work with Rudy.\n\nUkraine got the message. Its officials \u201cexpressed concern to U.S. senators that the aid had been held up as a penalty for resisting that pressure\u201d to investigate Biden, reports the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAmerican foreign policy operates in regimented and bureaucratized ways. Turning over the machinery to the president\u2019s personal attorney, who is not a foreign-policy expert or even a government employee, distorted the entire process, in ways that were noticeable throughout the government. The Washington Post has the most detailed account of the contortions. Giuliani circumvented unhelpful diplomats, even replacing one deemed troublesome. Several meetings on Ukraine policy at the White House leading up to the July 25 call \u201cled some participants to fear that Trump and those close to him appeared prepared to use U.S. leverage with the new leader of Ukraine for Trump\u2019s political gain.\u201d\n\nThe White House\u2013issued summary of Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky shows the American president pressing his counterpart to undertake the twin investigations. After Trump asks Zelensky to investigate Biden, and Zelensky makes accommodating noises in response, Trump promises to have Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr call him. Barr also was involved in preventing Congress from seeing the whistle-blower complaint, and the call summary shows that he had a personal interest in doing so. Add Barr to the list of impeachment witnesses.\n\nThere may be many others. Last night on Fox News, Giuliani held up a phone he said included messages with official authorization for his activities. \u201cYou know who I did it at the request of? The State Department,\u201d he said. The scheme to shake down Ukraine was a massive plot, spreading through the government and corrupting multiple officials. Trump had a lot of accomplices.\n\nGet the latest from Jonathan Chait in your inbox. Analysis and commentary on the latest political news from New York columnist Jonathan Chait.
