We are committed to stopping Brexit so that we can mend our broken politics, build a fairer society and protect our planet.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian reported that the party would back immediately revoking Article 50 in an election campaign but would go back to supporting a second referendum and campaigning to remain in the EU if it does not win the election.\n\nPress Association", "description": "The Liberal Democrats are poised to campaign to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50 to allow the UK to remain in the European Union, party leader Jo Swinson has said.
