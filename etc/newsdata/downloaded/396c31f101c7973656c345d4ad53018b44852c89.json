The government has said Tsang\u2019s condition was stable after surgery.\n\nA police statement said the youth will be charged Thursday afternoon with two counts of attacking police. It is unclear if he will appear in court.\n\nBREAKING: Police say criminal charges will be filed against the 18-year-old Hong Kong student who was the first victim of police gunfire in the pro-democracy protests. https://t.co/YVemyu9hSU \u2014 The Associated Press (@AP) October 3, 2019\n\nThousands of people rallied Wednesday to demand police accountability for the shooting, with many saying the use of lethal weaponry was unjustified.\n\n\u201cThe Hong Kong police have gone trigger-happy and nuts,\u201d pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said.\n\nMo, who said she repeatedly watched videos of the shooting, echoed what many people expressed.\n\n\u201cThe sensible police response should have been to use a police baton or pepper spray, etc., to fight back. It wasn\u2019t exactly an extreme situation and the use of a live bullet simply cannot be justified,\u201d she said.\n\nMore than 2,000 people chanted \u201cNo rioters, only tyranny\u201d as they filled an open-air stadium near Tsang\u2019s school in Tsuen Wan district in northern Hong Kong on Wednesday night. Many held posters reading, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot our kids\u201d and held an arm across their chest below their left shoulder \u2014 the location of Tsang\u2019s gunshot wound.\n\nSeveral other peaceful rallies were held elsewhere, with protesters vowing not to give up their fight for more rights including direct elections for the city\u2019s leaders and police accountability. But pockets of protesters vented their anger. Black-clad youths smashed ticket machines and vandalized facilities at two northern subway stations. In Tsuen Wan, hundreds marched along the streets. Some smashed Bank of China teller machines and others removed metal railings and dug up bricks from pavements to build barriers, blocking traffic.\n\nStudents protest outside school of 18-year-old protester shot in chest by police in Hong Kong. https://t.co/WzINLSLiqO pic.twitter.com/VSJ0t1r3EZ \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) October 2, 2019\n\nEarlier Wednesday, hundreds of people, including students, sat crossed-legged outside Tsang\u2019s school chanting anti-police slogans. One held a hand-written message condemning \u201cthug police.\u201d\n\nSchoolmates said Tsang loves basketball and was passionate about the pro-democracy cause. A student who wore a Guy Fawkes mask and declined to be named because of fear of retribution said Tsang was \u201clike a big brother\u201d to him and other junior students.\n\n\u201cDuring the protests, we would feel safe if he is around because he was always the first to charge forward and would protect us when we were in danger,\u201d the student said.\n\n\u201cI vividly remember him saying that he would rather die than be arrested. What an awful twist of fate that it was he of all people who was shot by the police.\u201d\n\nMany students felt that firing at Tsang\u2019s chest, close to his heart, was an attempt to kill him. Police said Tsang has been arrested despite being hospitalized and that authorities will decide later whether to press charges.\n\nMore than 1,000 office workers also skipped their lunch to join an impromptu march in the city\u2019s business district against the shooting, which police have defended as \u201creasonable and lawful.\u201d\n\nPolice Commissioner Stephen Lo said late Tuesday the officer had feared for his life and made \u201ca split-second\u201d decision to fire a single shot at close range. He denied police had been given permission to shoot to kill.\n\nResponding to questions about why the officer shot at Tsang\u2019s chest, instead of his limbs, Deputy Police Commissioner Tang Ping-Keung said Wednesday the officer had fired at an area that could immobilize the youth quickly.\n\nTang said the officer\u2019s action was in line with international procedures, but that police would conduct an in-depth investigation into the shooting.\n\nThis protester was shot in the chest by Hong Kong police, marking the first time a person has been injured by live rounds in 4 months of demonstrations pic.twitter.com/zqSePUufeN \u2014 NowThis (@nowthisnews) October 2, 2019\n\nVideos on social media of the shooting showed a dozen black-clad protesters throwing objects at police and closing in on a lone officer, who opened fire as the masked Tsang came at him with a metal rod. Just as another protester rushed in to try to drag Tsang away but was tackled by an officer, a gasoline bomb landed in the middle of the group of officers in an explosion of flames.\n\nRiot police fired tear gas and water cannons Tuesday as usually bustling streets became battlefields. Thumbing their noses at Chinese President Xi Jinping, protesters ignored a security clampdown and fanned across the city armed with gasoline bombs, sticks and bricks.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government said the widespread rioting Tuesday was orchestrated, echoing Beijing\u2019s stance, and called on parents and teachers to help restrain young protesters.\n\nBritish Foreign Minister Dominic Raab criticized the shooting as \u201cdisproportionate\u201d and some U.S. lawmakers also joined in the condemnation.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry office in Hong Kong accused British and American politicians of condoning violence and crime. It called the rioters the \u201cgreatest threat to Hong Kong and the common enemy of the international community.\u201d", "description": "Police said Tsang Chi-kin, 18, will be charged for attacking cops.
