Now it\u2019s at 51 percent saying that President Trump should be impeached and removed from office. What say you?\n\nSEN. KEVIN CRAMER: I say let\u2019s see where the facts lead, but this is not a legitimate impeachment inquiry. This is unprecedented and not just a political process, it is a partisan political process that\u2019s completely void of any due process. And in our system, you are entitled to due process. This is a circumstance where the accuser gets to remain anonymous and the accused gets to remain defenseless.\n\nIt\u2019s unfair to the president, it\u2019s unfair to the presidency. It\u2019s an overeach by the Democratic Party in the House of Representatives and they ought to be ashamed of themselves. They want a fast prosecution before it unravels \u2014 just like the Mueller investigation. That went so poorly for them, they were so embarrassed by it that this time around that they decided to just try a man by declaring him guilty before they even have the trail, before they even allow due process, before they allow witnesses, before they allow cross-examination or subpoenas by the accused or the accused\u2019s allies.\n\nIt\u2019s a grossly unfair process. This is going to rip this country apart and I believe it\u2019s designed to do exactly that. It\u2019s designed to undermine the credibility of our country when we\u2019re on the international stage doing big trade deals, involved in geopolitical issues around the world, and the Democrats would rather see America fail than Donald Trump succeed. They should be ashamed of themselves.", "description": "Cramer criticized the House Democrats' impeachment probe against Trump as illegitimate and warned it will \"rip this country apart.\"", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Sen-Kevin-Cramer-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
