That would also deliver the first surplus in more than 12 years.\n\nCormann says don't over-interpret\n\nThe Minister for Finance, Senator Mathias Cormann, who has been negotiating the size of the drought assistance package, said it was important not to get ahead of expectations, especially based on early monthly readings that are frequently not in line with forecasts.\n\n\"It is important not to over-interpret monthly movements, but having brought the budget back to balance last financial year we remain on track to deliver the first budget surplus for more than a decade,\" Senator Cormann said.\n\nThe better-than-expected position was driven by higher receipts \u2013 up $627 million from that forecast in the May budget.\n\nThe surprise increase in revenue came from superannuation taxes. They came in at $2.77 billion or over $150 million more than the budget forecast of $2.62 billion.\n\nHowever, the company tax take was down $1.1 billion on forecasts. Total company tax receipts came in at $21.83 billion, less than the $22.93 billion forecast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustralia's monthly trade surplus dipped back to $5.9 billion in August after hitting a record $8 billion in June, mainly due to a reduction in the price of iron ore and coal.\n\nWhile that surplus was largely in line with consensus, economists expect lower commodity prices in coming months to erode some of the surplus.\n\nThe goods and services tax take in the first three months was also behind estimates. A total of $15.97 billion in GST was collected, a marginal $83 million less than what was forecast, but this has no net impact on the budget as the GST revenue is passed on to states.\n\nTotal payments were also higher, up $444 million more than the 2019-20 budget profile.\n\nLast month the federal government revealed it had returned the budget to a virtual \"balance\" in the full 2019 financial year. The deficit for 2018-19 shrunk to just $690 million, or 0.03 per cent of the economy's output.", "description": "A better-than-expected budget position in the first three months of the financial year has triggered more calls to bring forward further drought assistance.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2291%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0bac627bf6dd0009c9d1d4c955db4a9470f4e283", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
