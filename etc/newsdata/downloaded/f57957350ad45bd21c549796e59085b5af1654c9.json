Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected sentiment to hold at 96 at the end of October.\n\n--Consumer sentiment remains modestly down from the post-recession peak touched last year.\n\n--The survey's measure of current conditions ticked down to 113.2 at the end of October from 113.4 earlier in the month. The gauge of future expectations decreased to 84.2 from 84.8 earlier in the month.\n\n--\"The focus of consumers has been on income and job growth, while largely ignoring other news,\" said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist. References to the negative impact of tariffs fell to 27% in October from September's 36%. Of those surveyed, 2% mentioned the impeachment inquiry, less than the 5% who mentioned a negative impact from the General Motors strike. \"To be sure, the multiple sources of uncertainty will keep consumers focused on potential threats to their prevailing optimism, with the most critical being threats that could significantly diminish their job and income prospects,\" Mr. Curtin said.\n\nWrite to Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 25, 2019 10:29 ET (14:29 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
