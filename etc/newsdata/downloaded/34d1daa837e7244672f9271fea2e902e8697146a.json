On Wednesday, Slack\u2019s losses quickened after it warned that its losses will widen in the upcoming third quarter \u2014 on top of slowing sales growth and higher expenses.\n\n\u201cSometimes you can do really well but it\u2019s not good enough to placate the people who are invested in you,\u201d Rishi Jaluria, D.A. Davidson\u2019s senior vice president & senior research analyst, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM.\n\n\u201cThis is a little bit of the pitfalls of having high expectations,\u201d Jaluria argued.\n\nWhile Slack is trading above its IPO price of $26 per share, it\u2019s still significantly below June\u2019s spike high of $38.50. On Friday, the stock shed an additional 6% to trade above $28.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very evident in my sector of enterprise software that a lot of these names are very, very expensive because they\u2019re growing so fast and have the potential to become very, very profitable,\u201d he added.\n\nJaluria, who currently holds a neutral rating on Slack\u2019s stock, is taking the company\u2019s third quarter guidance with a grain of salt.\n\nThe same goes for other analysts like Citigroup \u2014 which also rates Slack at neutral with a US$39.00 price target \u2014 given that most of 2019\u2019s class of tech \u201cunicorns\u201d that have floated initial public offerings (IPOs) have had a rocky time as public companies.\n\n\u201cAll these newly minted IPOs to the public market put their guidance bar very, very low so they can get into a comfortable beat and raise cadence,\u201d according to Jaluria.\n\n\u201cWe see that with Slack. The fact is, Slack beat their second quarter guidance in spite of [an] $8 million headwind,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat tells you they definitely got conservative,\u201d Jaluria added, referring to the company paying out customer credits due to temporary system outages that occurred in June and July.\n\n\u2018Absolutely immense\u2019\n\nThe logo of the Slack Technologies Inc. is seen outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) after their company public offering (IPO) on June 20, 2019 located at Wall Street in New York City.

And we\u2019re starting to see early signs of more traditional, slow-moving industries like financial services.\u201d\n\nTo be certain, Slack\u2019s numbers weren\u2019t bad. In its second quarter report, the company said the number of customers bringing it more than $100,000 in annual recurring revenue jumped by 75% year-over-year.\n\nWith growth that aggressive, Jaluria views Slack\u2019s cash-burn rate as an essential aspect of building its customer base and marketshare.\n\nThe company\u2019s \u201cburning cash \u2014 but they\u2019re doing so in a responsible manner,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re fishing on their sails. They\u2019ve got a marketing model, they have really high gross margins. They\u2019ve got this long runway of growth.\u201d\n\nJaluria added: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want them to underinvest when the opportunity is so vast and so huge. It\u2019s absolutely there for them to seize. It\u2019s really just execution.\u201d\n\nNick Robertson is a senior producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,Flipboard,SmartNews,LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "D.A.
