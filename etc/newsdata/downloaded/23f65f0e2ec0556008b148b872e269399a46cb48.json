Before the contract was terminated EOH Mthombo was a Microsoft Channel Partner, meaning it sold certain Microsoft products or services.\n\n\n\nAt the time EOH said Microsoft did not provide reasons for the termination.\n\n\"This LSP contract will position Altron Karabina as partners to customers that embark on digital transformation. Customers invest in technology to increase sales; improve operational efficiencies; transform customer and employee experience; and drive innovation,\" said Nyati.\n\nBeing appointed as an LSP also ushers in an exciting time for Altron Karabina, according to Grant van der Wal, Altron Karabina's managing director.\n\n\"The LSP licence allows us to launch our software services division, adding to our Microsoft competencies in data and analytics, artificial intelligence, customer relationship management, ERP, modern workplace, Azure, and DevOps,\" says Van der Wal.\n\nThe software services division is launched at a time when there is a significant shift to cloud-based services, as seen following the recent opening of the Microsoft data centres, according to Altron.\n\n\"We will offer consumption billing to our customers as they unlock the strategic value delivered through the cloud. The new software services team will work closely with the consulting services team to serve customers in the best way possible,\" concluded van der Wal.\n\nAltron, through its subsidiary, Bytes UK, is Microsoft's biggest LSP partner in the United Kingdom, a position the technology company plans to extend to South Africa. Altron Karabina is working closely with Bytes UK to duplicate their success locally, according to the statement.", "description": "Microsoft has named JSE-listed technology company Altron as a licensing solution provider in South Africa.", "authors": ["Compiled Carin Smith"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6102/eded1536848a496fbf2d17ad2d371bf2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
