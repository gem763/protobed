As Trump declared to his adoring fans, without even a hint of humanity about the suffering this would cause to civilians, \u201cSometimes you have to let them fight like two kids. Then you pull them apart.\u201d\n\nThis follows Trump\u2019s comments on Wednesday, when he did his best to callously dispel humanitarian concerns many have voiced for the Kurds. First, Trump dismissively stated that the Kurds were \u201cno angels.\u201d He then did his best to dehumanize both sides in the battle, declaring that the Kurds and Turks have been fighting for \u201chundreds of years,\u201d which he explained in essence is just who these people are. I\u2019m not exaggerating, Trump stated that \u201cwarring\u201d and killing is \u201cunnatural for us, but its sorta natural for them.\u201d\n\nMany were stunned by Trump\u2019s comments, but not me. The why behind Trump\u2019s comments is simple. He was simply updating the old concept of \u201cKill them all, let God sort it out\u201d to \u201clet the Muslims slaughter each other and let Allah sort it out.", "description": "It used to be just a throwaway jingoistic phrase to let all the Muslims kill each other.
