(AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) \u2014 Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 rejected allegations Friday that he has ties to an illegal armed group in Colombia, as officials launched an investigation based on photos appearing in social media purportedly showing him posing with members of the gang.\n\nThe pictures were allegedly taken in late February when Guaid\u00f3 crossed into Colombia and made a surprise appearance at a concert organized by billionaire Richard Branson aimed at helping deliver humanitarian aid to Venezuela.\n\nGovernment officials loyal to President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro are holding up the photos as proof that Guaid\u00f3's covert journey was orchestrated with the help of a Colombian criminal gang known as the Rastrojos, an accusation he denies.\n\n\"That day I took photos with many people,\" Guaid\u00f3 told Colombia's BLU radio. \"Evidently it's hard to know who is asking you for a photo.\"\n\nThe spat over the pictures comes amid escalating tensions between Colombia and Venezuela as the presidents of both countries accuse one another of harboring illegal armed groups plotting across-the-border attacks.\n\nOn Wednesday, a dozen nations including the United States invoked the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, which contends that a threat against any single signatory should be considered a danger to them all. The act raises the stakes of a potential military response though all sides have said they want a peaceful solution.\n\nVenezuelan Interior Minister Nestor Reverol appeared on state television Friday laying out evidence for a new probe into Guaid\u00f3, displaying images at the center of the controversy.\n\n\"They prove yet again Guaido's association with all the terrorist actions being planned in Venezuela to disrupt the stability and peace of our democracy,\" he said.\n\nGen. Luis Fernando Navarro, the commander of Colombia's military, said two of the men seen in the photos with Guaid\u00f3 are members of the Rastrojos who have now been captured. The photos show both men posing individually with Guaid\u00f3 before a wooded background.\n\nNavarro identified one of the men as Albeiro Lobo Quintero, alias Brother, and the other as Jhon Jairo Dur\u00e1n, alias Menor. Quintero allegedly turned himself into Colombian authorities sometime after the photograph was taken, while Dur\u00e1n was captured from a canoe after being injured in a fight with another criminal group in Venezuela.\n\nNavarro said he couldn't confirm exactly when or where the photos were taken.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 told BLU radio that he had no recollection of the photos being taken, and that he is pleased to know both men are no longer free.\n\n\"I celebrate that they've been detained,\" Guaid\u00f3 said.\n\nThe Rastrojos have been operating in the region for nearly two decades and at one point were considered a major drug trafficking group. However, their numbers are believed to have waned after the capture of several top leaders in 2012.\n\nTarek William Saab, Venezuela's attorney general and a Maduro ally, rejected Guaid\u00f3's claim that he had no idea who the men were. The new investigation is the fifth that Venezuelan officials have launched against Guaid\u00f3 in recent months. He's also being accused of sparking violent protests and orchestrating a nationwide blackout.\n\n\"It's unimaginable to assume these were simply photographs taken by enamored fans who wanted a photo on the border with this guy,\" Saab said. \"Nobody believes this story.\"\n\nA video released back in February showed Guaid\u00f3 crossing a small border bridge with a dozen aides dressed in collared work shirts. He jogged as he crossed, lifting up his hand and shouting encouraging words like, \"We can do it!\"\n\nGuaid\u00f3 was barred from leaving the nation at the time.\n\nMany Venezuelans use backroads known as \"trochas\" that crisscross along the 1,370-mile (2,200-kilometer) border with Colombia. Hundreds of such illegal crossings are controlled by criminal gangs.\n\nColombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque said Friday that officials had helped Guaid\u00f3 in securing his safety as he entered the country though provided few details.\n\n\"We facilitated his entry to Colombian territory,\" he said.\n\nRelations between Colombia and Venezuela reached a low point earlier this year when Maduro broke off diplomatic relations after Duque backed Guaid\u00f3 in a failed push to deliver international humanitarian aid across the border.", "description": "Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 rejected allegations Friday that he has ties to an illegal armed group in Colombia, as officials launched an investigation based on photos appearing in social media purportedly showing him posing with members of the gang.
