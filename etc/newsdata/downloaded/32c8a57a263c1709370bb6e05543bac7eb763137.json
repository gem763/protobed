She called for international action to mitigate the impact there.\n\nThe UN high commissioner for human rights also denounced the \u201cdrastic acceleration of deforestation of the Amazon.\n\n\u201cThe fires currently raging across the rainforest may have catastrophic impact on humanity as a whole, but their worst effects are suffered by the women, men and children who live in these areas,\u201d she said.\n\nShe urged authorities in Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil to \u201censure the implementation of longstanding environmental policies \u2026 thus preventing future tragedies\u201d.\n\nBachelet\u2019s comments risk further angering the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who last week accused her of meddling in his country\u2019s affairs after she criticised the deteriorating rights situation there.\n\nBolsonaro taunts UN rights chief over her father's torture by Pinochet regime Read more\n\nThe UN rights chief also highlighted the impact climate change is having on insecurity around the world. She cited a UN estimate that 40% of civil wars over the past six decades have been linked to environmental degradation.\n\nIn the Sahel region of Africa for instance, degradation of arable land \u201cis intensifying competition for already scarce resources\u201d, she said. This in turn exacerbates ethnic tensions, and fuels violence and political instability, she added.\n\nBachelet lamented that those sounding the alarm over the devastating impacts of climate change are often attacked.\n\nUN experts, she said, had \u201cnoted attacks on environmental human rights defenders in virtually every region, particularly in Latin America\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am disheartened by this violence, and also by the verbal attacks on young activists such as Greta Thunberg and others, who galvanise support for prevention of the harm their generation may bear,\u201d Bachelet said.\n\n\u201cThe demands made by environmental defenders and activists are compelling, and we should respect, protect and fulfil their rights.\u201d", "description": "Rights chief Michelle Bachelet highlights climate\u2019s role in civil wars, saying: \u2018The world has never seen a threat to human rights of this scope\u2019", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Geneva"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2c257bcba735b998d9a9b7a9c9853af6f1fe7c2/0_72_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a3885c5ffe2745e158ccf7ee11c0624a", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
