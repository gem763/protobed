Hundreds of students gathered outside in a show of support.\n\nThe teenager took a bullet to the upper left-hand side of his body after a violent confrontation between protesters and riot officers in the Tsuen Wan district during the widespread chaos that broke out on China\u2019s National Day.\n\nStephen Lo, the Hong Kong police commissioner, was quick to defend the officer\u2019s actions, saying that he feared for his life.\n\n\"The police officers had given warnings but to no avail. The police officers' lives were seriously endangered and were forced to use a firearm to stop the violent attacks,\" he told a press conference. \"The approach was reasonable and lawful.\"\n\nPro-democracy protests have been raging in Hong Kong for four months Credit: Kin Cheung/AP More\n\nViral footage which was filmed at multiple angles by journalists at the scene shows a group of demonstrators with bars and umbrellas fighting with outnumbered police officers. An officer runs in to back up his colleagues with his handgun already drawn.\n\nAs Mr Tsang swings his pole a shot rings out and he slowly staggers backwards to the ground. A friend who rushes to help is tackled by another officer and a group of protesters throw a petrol bomb, landing at the feet of the riot police.\n\nThe teenager, who later underwent surgery, suffered the first injury from live ammunition in four months of escalating political unrest. It is not clear from the footage why the officer did not reach for non-lethal protection, including pepper spray.\n\nAccording to police, 1,400 rounds of tear gas were fired on Tuesday, along with 900 rubber bullets and six live rounds.\n\nBut it is the single gunshot injury which has stunned a city now increasingly used to clouds of teargas on in its main shopping and residential districts, and the incident threatens to further widen the gulf of mistrust that already exists between large sectors of the public and the police.\n\nThe pro-democracy camp has insisted that this shooting, and the firing of a non-lethal projectile at an Indonesian journalist which blinded her right eye, are egregious examples of the excessive force increasingly being deployed by the police.\n\nSome protesters have begun to add a sixth entry to their list of demands \u2013 disband the police force.\n\nThe police, who have been deployed to tackle the crisis in the absence of a political solution, have in turn urged the government to issue curfew orders or adopt measures under a tough colonial-era emergency law to empower their thinly stretched force.\n\nAt least 30 officers were injured during Tuesday\u2019s street violence.\n\nStory continues", "description": "A teenager who was shot by the Hong Kong police on Tuesday during some of the worst violence the financial hub has witnessed in four months of pro-democracy protests has been charged with rioting and assault.", "authors": ["Nicola Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ujaB3I6PBlnBiqSIraneCg--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/e78d8f90dfea7b93f43f0abcd0904fa2", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
