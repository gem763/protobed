If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nLet's face facts: everyone dreads going to the dentist. We all pretend to partake in good oral health by brushing our teeth 20 times in a row before our appointment, but it never seems to fool the dental assistant once you're in that darn chair. While I could definitely win an Oscar for my delivery of \"yes, of course!\" when the dentist asks me if I've been flossing, I'd rather just invest in the dental essentials needed to have a pearly white smile. And right now might just be the best time to do so, as there's great discounts on both a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush and Crest WhiteStrips on Amazon.\n\nThe first step to a gorgeous smile is making sure your teeth and gums are healthy. This is where an electric toothbrush shines. They're designed so you know exactly the correct amount of time you need to brush, and their motorized heads are way more effective at removing plaque and surface stains than a traditional toothbrush. One of the most well-known and popular brands is Philips Sonicare, and right now you can save a sweet $10 on their ProtectiveClean 6100 in pink, white, and navy blue if you clip the on-page coupon, which will bring the total to just under $100. This one in particular has three intensities and three modes including clean, whiten and gum care, and will even alert you with a pulse if you're brushing too hard. Pretty fancy, eh?\n\nTo be proud of your smile you also want your teeth to be super sparkly and white. Since most of us can't afford to shell out hundreds on professional whitening, Crest Whitestrips are the next best thing. These 3D Whitestrips are highly reviewed (from over 3,500 shoppers), and claim to be able to remove years of stains in just 1 hour for a noticeably whiter smile. And don't worry about tooth damage, as Crest avows these contain the same enamel-safe whitening ingredient that dentists use. Right now you can also save $10 by clipping the on-page coupon, so they'll only cost you $35. Just don't go overboard on the whitening and end up like Ross in that one episode of Friends.\n\nGet the Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean 6100 Electric Toothbrush on Amazon for $99.99 (Save $10)\n\nGet the Crest 3D Whitestrips for $34.99 on Amazon (Save $10)\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
