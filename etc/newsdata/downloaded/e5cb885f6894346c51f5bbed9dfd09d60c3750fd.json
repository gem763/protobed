Come quick.' So I ran up the staircase, and I found the princess crumpled in the middle of her room with the telephone to her ear, and she beckoned me to come closer. I could hear what her mother was saying.\n\nShe said, 'Listen. Listen to what mummy's saying.'\n\nMr Burrell claims that Mrs Shand Kydd had been drinking that evening and was 'berating the Princess.'\n\nPrincess Diana previously had a relationship with two Muslim men, heart surgeon Hasnat Khan and Dodi Fayed, the son of billionaire Mohamed Al-Fayed.\n\nThe claim has been made by Diana's former butler Paul Burrell in a new documentary called 'Princess Diana's Wicked Stepmother' that focuses on Countess Raine Spencer, and her impact on the Princess\n\nHe added that she said : 'That's what you are. I've raised a wh***, who**** around town with Muslim men.\n\n'You should be ashamed of yourself.' Diana was sobbing, saying 'Mummy, please don't say those words to me.\n\n'Please don't call me those names.' She begged her. She kept begging her not to say it.'\n\nAfter the tirade Diana apparently pulled back from her relationship with her mother, and shortly afterwards she was killed in the car crash in Paris in 1997.", "description": "The claim has been made by Princess Diana's former butler Paul Burrell in a new documentary called 'Princess Diana's Wicked Stepmother' that focuses on Countess Raine Spencer.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/18/20291130-0-image-a-11_1572285963577.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
