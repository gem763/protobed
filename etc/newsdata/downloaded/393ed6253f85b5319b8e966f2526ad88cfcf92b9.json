The study found that in the 2015 election, 43% of people voted for a different party than in 2010, bringing a record high share of the vote for parties other than the main three.\n\nTwo years later, 33% of people switched for the 2017 poll, and the Conservatives and Labour won more than 82% of the votes. In this election there was also the biggest movement in voters between the two main parties detected in BES data.\n\nAcross the three elections of 2010, 2015 and 2017, 49% of people changed votes at least once.\n\nThe study concludes that only two recorded elections have had higher aggregate volatility than 2015 and 2017, both of which took place in deeply unusual circumstances.\n\nThe first was in 1918, after the first world war and following the expansion of the voting franchise. The other was in 1931, when a post-depression national government won a landslide.\n\nThe authors of the research, which is to be collated into a book published this year, say this context, plus the fact that Brexit will still be a live issue in the coming months, makes the likely imminent next election hugely difficult to call.\n\n\u201cGiven the UK\u2019s recent history of vote switching and the unpredictability of the current climate, it would be unwise for any political party or commentator to presume how voters will behave in a general election, particularly in the middle of an electoral shock,\u201d said Edward Fieldhouse, a politics professor at Manchester University. \u201cBut we do expect to see big shifts defined largely by Brexit.\u201d\n\nThe idea of electoral shocks seeks to explain the extent of vote switching, which the researchers say goes beyond longer-term factors such as a gradual weakening in party loyalties, especially among new cohorts of younger voters.\n\nThe study found that the 2017 election had the largest recorded amount of voter movement between the two big parties. One in eight Conservative voters from 2015 backed Labour, with one in 11 former Labour voters moving the other way.\n\nThis totalled 11% of the electorate switching between the two parties. In contrast, during Tony Blair\u2019s landslide election win in 1997, the figure was 9%.\n\nThe research suggests that the cumulative effect could be more volatility, as new electoral shocks shift already unattached voters. With the likelihood of a new departure extension before the next election, Brexit seems set to be a key factor \u2013 and one that is hard to predict.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the Brexit situation will be on election day,\u201d said Jane Green, professor of politics at Oxford University. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who will get the blame for the current political deadlock, or who will benefit.\n\n\u201cBut we do expect there to be clear winners and losers because voters are now more changeable in response to such shock events. A key driver of vote choice will be how competent each party is perceived to be on Brexit.\u201d", "description": "Survey says voter choices have been rocked by \u2018electoral shocks\u2019", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12187144da0ea5b035636095cb40bdeb3ef79abf/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0ce4f6749fd7cb80a670560f2e4db18b", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
