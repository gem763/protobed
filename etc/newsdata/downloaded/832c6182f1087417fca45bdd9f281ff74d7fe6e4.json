[Photo/Agencies]\n\nMasked rioters went on a destructive rampage across Kowloon in Hong Kong on Sunday, zeroing in on police officers and stores with mainland links with wanton criminality and a range of weapons.\n\nIt was the 20th straight weekend of social unrest in Hong Kong.\n\nA video recording showed a black-clad, masked person throwing a petrol bomb from a flyover in Prince Edward into a group of police officers below.

Mobs hurled over a dozen petrol bombs at the stations.\n\nAround 6:30 pm, police deployed a remote-controlled bomb-disposal robot to detonate a paper box that was suspected of containing explosives. The box, with electric cables fastened around it, was placed on the road one block from the Sham Shui Po police station.\n\nBefore detonating the box, the police seized 42 petrol bombs and raw materials for creating paintballs from two vehicles in Tai Po. They did not rule out the possibility they were being prepared for use in the anti-government protests across Kowloon. Two men, age 31 and 34, were arrested at the scene, the police said.\n\nBesides police officers, rioters also turned their ire on stores with mainland links. Household names like snack giant Best Mart 360, Xiaomi Hong Kong, Bank of China, Chung Hwa Book Company and Chinese medicine company Beijing Tong Ren Tang were among the vandalized shops.\n\nMobs pried open the shutter of Bank of China's Jordan branch and smashed counters.
