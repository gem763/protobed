It noted that given the minuscule size of samples taken from a single bottle, different samples may yield different results.\n\nTalc is mined from mineral deposits that can be contaminated with asbestos. J&J; says its powder is routinely tested to ensure there\u2019s no asbestos.\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson recall came as the company fights thousands of lawsuits in which plaintiffs claim its baby talcum powder was contaminated with asbestos and that it caused ovarian cancer or mesothelioma, a rare cancer linked to inhaling asbestos fibers.\n\nAt multiple trials, J&J;\u2019s expert witnesses have testified asbestos hasn\u2019t been detected in the talc in its baby powder in thousands of tests over the last 40 years. Several juries have reached multimillion-dollar verdicts against the company, nearly all of which are being appealed or have been overturned on appeal.\n\nShares in Johnson & Johnson, which is based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, rose about 3% in after-hours trading Tuesday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Johnson & Johnson said Tuesday that new testing of a batch of baby powder that was recently recalled did not show any traces of asbestos.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/29/baby_powder_safety_48328_c0-194-4312-2709_s1200x700.jpg?899d1612f5d01659a3f127bc2335cd5f54752927", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
