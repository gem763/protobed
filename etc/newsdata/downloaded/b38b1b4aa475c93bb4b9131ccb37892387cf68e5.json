Hair: Sven Bayerbach. Make-up: Nicky Webb. Dress, Rixo, from Trilogy. Sandals, Malone Souliers\n\nI have two recurring stress dreams. One is about sitting my history A-level and realising just before the exam that I misread the timetable at the beginning of term and have missed all the relevant lessons. The other is about having to pack up a room filled with so much paraphernalia that I have no way of doing it in the allotted time. Never let it be said that I don\u2019t dream big.\n\nAnyway, I believe the first of these dreams is a pretty standard anxiety response. But it\u2019s the second I\u2019ve been thinking about lately, as I prepare to move house. For years I identified myself as a creature of habit. In my late 20s, I had a strong nesting instinct and longed to build a home for the family that I believed would inevitably follow. I got married. We moved into a terraced house in a sensible part of London, surrounded by buggies and coffee shops and soft play areas. But the family never happened. I tried and failed to have children. The soft play areas started to make me sad when I walked past them. The coffee shops were too noisy to work in because all the antenatal groups went there.\n\nMy marriage ended. When I left, I also left my home and any shared possessions. I walked out with two bags of clothes. For a year, I lived in other people\u2019s houses \u2013 either with generous friends or in Airbnbs booked for stints abroad. I was liberated by the discovery that I did not, after all, need the attachment of physical objects. In fact, I found that I could make myself feel at home almost anywhere, as long as I had my laptop to write, my phone to call my friends and a dressing gown (this latter item, I have learned, is absolutely essential).\n\nAfter 12 months of a nomadic existence, I rented a flat. I moved to a different part of London, one I\u2019d never properly explored before and which came with no sad memories. The flat was small and filled with light. There was a bay window where I put my desk. As I typed out columns and novels, I watched neighbourhood cats gambol along the pavement. I thought that this flat would be another transitional space. I kept all my suitcases stacked on top of the cupboards, within easy reach. \u2018I won\u2019t be here for long,\u2019 I thought. \u2018The next phase of my life will start soon.\u2019\n\nBut my flat became its own phase. I put up pictures where I wanted, without having to accommodate another person\u2019s taste. I filled the shelves with books and mementos. I have now been here for three years. My flat has been an extraordinary refuge, a place that is mine and a space that is safe.\n\nI look around and I see the ghosts of memories, both happy and sad. Here is the table I laid a cloth over the first time my parents came to visit. This sofa is where an ex-boyfriend was sitting when we broke up. There is the window out of which I then smoked a cigarette, even though I don\u2019t smoke. Here is the bed in which I recovered from pneumonia (it was probably the cigarette).\n\nThis bedroom, overlooking my neighbour\u2019s garden, is where I watched with envy as they stretched out on deckchairs during the heatwave. Here is the living room, where last week I hosted a leaving party for my friends. We drank champagne, ate crisps and toasted all that had gone before.\n\nI\u2019m moving out in a couple of days. It is for the happiest of reasons (to buy a place with the man I love) but I feel an appropriate degree of sadness, too. In saying goodbye to my flat, I\u2019m bidding farewell to a part of my past. It was a great privilege to have a room of my own at a time when I needed shelter. But now, having been put back together, it\u2019s time to move on \u2013 and, yes, I\u2019ll be taking my dressing gown with me.\n\nThis week I\u2019m\u2026\n\nInstitut Esthederm Adaptasun Mer et Tropiques suntan lotion, Dos Gardenias bikini, Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng\n\nWatching Years and Years \u2013 the Russell T Davies drama detailing a dystopian future that is simultaneously gripping and terrifying in its believability.\n\nWearing Asceno\u2019s classic white silk blazer \u2013 the perfect transitional piece to take you from daytime to evening.\n\nListening to the Root of Evil podcast, presented by the great-granddaughters of the prime suspect in the unsolved Black Dahlia murder case.", "description": "I have two recurring stress dreams.
