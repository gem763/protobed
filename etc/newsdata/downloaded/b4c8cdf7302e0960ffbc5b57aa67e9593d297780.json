His version of the altercation that ensued differs markedly from the report from Investigo and the incident is under criminal investigation.\n\nQuestions were raised over who within Credit Suisse instigated the operation to have Mr Khan followed, and who was aware of it.\n\nAs a result Credit Suisse hired law firm Homburger to examine the chain of responsibility and whether Mr Iqbal had violated the terms of his contract.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Thiam joined Credit Suisse as chief executive in 2015 after a career at Prudential\n\nThe personal relationship between Mr Thiam and Mr Khan was not part of the investigation, Credit Suisse said.\n\n\"The Homburger investigation did not identify any indication that the CEO had approved the observation of Iqbal Khan nor that he was aware of it prior to September 18, 2019, after the observation had been aborted,\" the bank said.\n\nCredit Suisse said that the decision to observe Mr Khan was \"wrong and disproportionate and has resulted in severe reputational damage to the bank\".\n\nBut it said the report had found it was chief operating officer, Mr Bou\u00e9e alone who had decided to initiate the observation of Mr Khan.\n\nThe Homburger report said neither its own investigations nor those of intelligence firm Investigo found evidence that Mr Iqbal had attempted to poach employees or customers away from Credit Suisse.", "description": "Private detectives were hired to track the Swiss bank's former head of wealth management.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/33E3/production/_109038231_hi056048076.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
