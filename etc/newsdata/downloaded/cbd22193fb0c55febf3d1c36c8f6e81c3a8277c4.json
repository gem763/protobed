We haven't even seen what she said for a due process of what she's going to provide. This is where she has failed once again. Now I know it's not easy to admit that you're wrong and she finally admitted she was wrong 34 days later, when I put the letter out asking her when she said they were having an impeachment inquiry \u2014 that now proves that they were wrong from the start.\u201d\n\nMinority Whip Steve Scalise Stephen (Steve) Joseph Scalise'Veterans for impeachment' signs seen at World Series game during Trump visit Trump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series GOP vows to take new steps to protect Trump MORE (R-La.) said he doesn\u2019t believe the measure will help bring transparency to the process as House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) \u2014 who is slated to introduce the measure on Tuesday \u2014 said it is intended to do, blasting Democrats for opting to hold the hearings behind closed doors and only allowing members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, House Intelligence Committee and House Oversight and Reform Committee attend the depositions.\n\n\u201cFrom what we're hearing, it sounds like all they're trying to do is codify the Soviet-style impeachment process that they've been running,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere they don't let both sides called witnesses, it's all Adam Schiff's personal show to try to build a case of innuendo because they don't have any real facts.\u201d\n\nRep.
