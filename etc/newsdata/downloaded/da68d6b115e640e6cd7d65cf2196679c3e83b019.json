He joins her for a family dinner and the two seem to be having a good time together.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the episode\u2019s final moments, and present-day Kate\u2019s reaction to the polaroid photo of her and her boyfriend at the time, that we learned that there is something up with him.\n\nSpeaking to Kate, in the final scene, Rebecca recalls the year after Jack died. She was trying hard to hold everyone together and wanted to believe her kids were happy. So much so that she \u201cdidn\u2019t see what was happening.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a rather cryptic line but, before she could elaborate, Kate interrupted her saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t see what was happening either,\u201d and leaving fans wondering what happened between her and Mark.\n\nThe show\u2019s executive producer Isaac Aptaker fueled the mystery.\n\n\u201cFans should have a healthy amount of concern,\u201d Aptaker revealed in his EW interview.\n\nDescribing the way Rebecca and Kate are talking about the relationship, he said that there\u2019s definitely something looming there.\n\nIn the end, he confirms fans\u2019 suspicions by saying that Mark might seem like a good guy, now, but it definitely looks like the relationship didn\u2019t end well for Kate.\n\nAs reported by TV Insider, there are quite a few theories out there about what really went wrong between Kate and Mark.\n\nLet\u2019s dive right in.\n\nManipulation\n\nIt\u2019s not a secret to anyone that Kate\u2019s life has been an emotional rollercoaster since the show\u2019s beginning. And losing her father is, without a doubt, her biggest trauma.\n\nIn the previous episode, it seemed that she was finally ready to get out into the world again. Then she meets Mark and he gets her a job at the record store.\n\nIn this episode, we learn that the two are dating already.\n\nEverything seems to be going well. However, Mark could have been the one who broke Kate\u2019s heart.\n\nAlthough Mark seems nice, there are definitely signs that point towards there having been an abusive relationship.\n\nTake their first meeting, for example. Minutes into meeting this boy, Kate is already sharing too much about herself, revealing that she is at her most vulnerable point. She tells him about her burned-down house and her father\u2019s subsequent death.\n\nIs it possible that by sharing this deeply personal stuff, Kate had made herself an easy target for manipulation? After all, she suffers a drastic physical change and Mark might as well be the catalyst for this. We\u2019ll have to wait and see.\n\nOther signs\n\nIn this episode, there\u2019s a situation that seems to indicate that Mark might not be as nice as he seems.\n\nHe surprises Kate by showing up at her new house and basically invites himself to an awkward family dinner.\n\nIt may seem kind of cute until you realize that he practically stalked Kate by looking up for her address. Even Kate said that was sweet, but also creepy.\n\nThere\u2019s also an issue of Kevin and Randall who don\u2019t seem to like Mark even though he seems charming.\n\nWhile Randal is subtle about it, Kevin is straight-up hating on Kate\u2019s new boyfriend. He says he\u2019s a few years older than her, but is it possible there is more to that comment than meets the eye?\n\nAfter all, Kevin and Kate are twins and he may be sensing that his sister is in danger and that there is something deeply wrong with this guy.\n\nOnly time will tell.
