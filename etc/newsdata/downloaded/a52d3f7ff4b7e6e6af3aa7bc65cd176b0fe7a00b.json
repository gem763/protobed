Ivan spent most of his thirty years behind bars at the jail\n\nMr Milat told Daily Mail Australia he didn't mind what happened to his brother -whether he is left on ice in the morgue indefinitely, and even suggested he be chucked back in jail.\n\n'I don't care where (he goes) - they can stick him back in Long Bay,' he said.\n\n'He was given seven life sentences, he did one, so that means there's six (sentences of) seventy-four years to go.\n\n'Which is what, four hundred and forty four years?'\n\nHe continued to throw out other suggestions as he insisted: 'We're not going to claim the body, we're not going to do anything.\n\n'They can stick it down Macquarie Street, they can do whatever they please.'\n\nBut there was one exception - he ruled out scattering Milat's ashes at the Belanglo state forest, saying the family never wanted to offend Milat's victims.\n\nThe family has explicitly ruled out scattering his ashes in the Belanglo state forest, despite troll suggestions online, and say his eventual grave will be unmarked\n\nBill Milat reads the final letter from his brother Ivan this week asking for 'a pauper's burial or whatever is suitable'\n\nMr Milat was handed a letter from his brother, days before his death, which told him 'don't pay for my funeral services or contribute in any way.' The backpacker killer suggested a pauper's funeral.\n\n'That's not what his last wishes were and it's as simple as that,' the stubborn sibling said.\n\nIn his statement earlier this week, minister Mr Roberts said: 'Hell will freeze over before Corrections pays a cent for this man's funeral.\n\n'Ivan Milat's body will remain on ice until the family stumps up cash or the family can tell police where the bodies are buried.'\n\nA Corrective Services spokeswoman said while the agency sometimes provides a funeral subsidy to families of inmates who died in custody, 'that will definitely not be happening in this case.'\n\nFormer prison governor John Heffernan said if nobody steps forward, Corrective Services or the NSW government is going to end up burying Milat\n\nBut former jail governor John Heffernan, who worked in prisons for three decades, said one way or the other the government would probably have to pay for it.\n\n'If nobody steps forward, given the fact he died in custody, Corrective Services has to step up to the mark and they've got to bury him,' he said.\n\nMr Heffernan said 'I couldn't give a stuff if they took him out to sea and threw him overboard. Most people probably think that way.\n\n'We can't do that - we're supposed to be a humane society'.\n\nNSW Health, which currently has his body on ice, was approached for comment.", "description": "Serial killer Ivan Milat's body should be thrown back in prison because he has more than four hundred years left to serve behind bars, his brother says.", "authors": ["Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/01/20355332-0-image-a-16_1572397849072.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
