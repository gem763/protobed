The Hong Kong government then decided in 1983 to peg its currency to the dollar to restore confidence. The exchange-rate system put in place then should once again weather the turmoil the city is facing.\n\nCould the protests that have embroiled Hong Kong for more than 100 days bring down the 36-year peg? The worries are understandable: Fixed-exchange-rate regimes fail all the time.\n\nBut Hong Kong\u2019s currency-board system is far more robust than an ordinary peg. Every single Hong Kong dollar in circulation is fully backed by liquid dollar-denominated foreign reserves. In fact, Hong Kong\u2019s $433 billion of foreign reserves is more than twice its monetary base, which also includes excess reserves in the banking system and short-term bills issued by the city\u2019s de facto central bank.\n\nUnlike many governments with failed pegs, Hong Kong has been very disciplined in sticking to its rules: It cannot create unbacked money, and has to allow its monetary base to fluctuate with capital flows. Hong Kong\u2019s money-supply growth has largely been in line with the growth of its foreign reserves.\n\nEven against a broader measure of money supply, Hong Kong\u2019s reserves still look ample: Reserves stand at nearly half of Hong Kong\u2019s local-currency M3, which includes all the Hong Kong dollar deposits in the city. It would take an unprecedented exodus of capital to push the reserves to dangerous levels.\n\nThe drawback of the peg is that it can create booms and busts in local asset prices as Hong Kong has essentially handed over its monetary policy-making to the Federal Reserve. The city\u2019s famously expensive property market is at least partly attributable to the currency arrangement, as local authorities can\u2019t tighten monetary policy on their own to rein in asset bubbles.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s dependably stable currency has helped Hong Kong in its role as an intermediary between China and the rest of the world.

This was the cost of defending the peg during the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998.\n\nBut these costs must be weighed against the benefits. Having such a dependably stable currency has vastly helped Hong Kong in its role as an intermediary between China and the rest of the world, first as a trading port and more recently as a financial center. Abandoning the peg now, just as other questions swirl over the city\u2019s future, would put all this at risk. That is why it won\u2019t happen for the foreseeable future.", "description": "The Hong Kong government decided to peg its currency to the dollar during a time of turmoil to restore confidence.
