However, their objections are their objections,\u201d says Johnny Depp of latest Dior campaign https://t.co/X9Inzyuz43 \u2014 Hollywood Reporter (@THR) September 9, 2019\n\nHe added: \"There was never ... any dishonorable [intent]. The film was made with a great respect for the indigenous people not just of North America but all over the world.\"\n\nIn fact, Depp said he thinks \"it's a pity that people jumped the gun and made these objections.\"\n\nThe teaser clip Depp was referring to was released in late August and featured Native American extras performing a ceremonial dance and wearing formal cultural attire, while Depp promotes the cologne and the brand.\n\nReactions on social media were direct and strong.\n\n\"My God,\" many wrote, while others added, \"Why are there still so many ads using Anti-Native Slurs and exploiting Native Americans?\"\n\nSome also called out the name Sauvage as a slur toward Native Americans.\n\nDior swiftly pulled the ad.\n\nThe company said in a statement to ABC News: \"The Parfums Christian Dior project is a part of AIO's Advance Indigeneity Campaign to change the misperceptions about Native Americans, to share accurate American history, to build awareness about Native Americans as contemporary peoples and to promote Indigenous worldviews. AIO supports Native American art, films, books, and other forms of Indigenous pop culture. Through the Advance Indigeneity Campaign, AIO continues to work at an international level with schools and universities to build innovative curriculum for and by Native peoples.\"\n\nIt closed: \"We are very proud of this collaboration with AIO on the new ad campaign for Sauvage.\"\n\nDepp added in the new interview that the team behind the ad worked with Comanche Nation and other organizations to be careful not to produce something offensive -- although many still found it so.\n\n\"It was a film made out of great respect and with great respect and love for the Native American peoples to bring light to them,\" he said.\n\nABC News' Lesley Messer contributed to this report.", "description": "Weeks after Dior ran and pulled a Sauvage teaser deemed offensive, Johnny Depp is speaking out in defense of it.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/johnny-depp-gty-ml-191009_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
