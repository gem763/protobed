Peter Lucian ( Peter Sarsgaard ) is a \u201chouse tuner,\u201d a profession he\u2019s invented and practices around New York, for a strictly word-of-mouth clientele. Armed with tuning forks and a classical-music education, he takes readings in the homes of unhappy apartment dwellers, determines what chord the place is playing\u2014no one wants a diminished life caused by a diminished chord\u2014and adjusts accordingly. Feng shui for the ears.\n\n\u201cYour radiator is D-flat,\u201d he tells one satisfied customer. Of Ellen ( Rashida Jones ), a transplant from Ohio living alone in one of the noisiest cities in the world, he asks, \u201cDo you eat bagels every morning?\u201d She needs a new toaster. The old one has put her apartment, and her life, in a minor key. C-minor, to be precise.\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating device, largely because Mr. Tyburski, who co-wrote the screenplay (and \u201cPalimpsest\u201d) with Ben Nabors, is no more of a rush to explain things than is Peter Lucian. Mr. Sarsgaard gives a measured and characteristically nuanced performance as a man absorbed in his work to a degree that is perhaps not healthy, but is for him both real and rewarding. And the stuff of obsession. His failure to pick up the clues Ellen drops, that she\u2019s interested in more than his acoustics, tells us much about Peter. And Mr. Tyburski\u2019s small directorial moves tell us much about her: \u201cMay I lie down on your bed?\u201d Peter asks Ellen, who blanches, but agrees; Peter wants to mimic her morning routine as closely as possible, which includes reaching an arm across the bed and finding no one there.\n\nPeter Sarsgaard Photo: IFC Films\n\nComparisons have already been made between Mr. Tyburski\u2019s film and those of Michael Almereyda (\u201cMarjorie Prime,\u201d \u201cHamlet\u201d), with their coolly intellectual surfaces and subsurface passion. \u201cThe Conversation\u201d is also an unavoidable reference. But I kept thinking of Amir Naderi, the great Iranian \u00e9migr\u00e9 director whose films about New York (\u201cManhattan by Numbers,\u201d \u201cABC Manhattan,\u201d \u201cMarathon\u201d) not only captured an oft-filmed city in exciting new ways but examined the many different worlds that coexist within it, independent and unknowing of each other. In Mr. Tyburski\u2019s drama, one of those worlds is the professional study of sound and one of Peter\u2019s crises is his rejection by academia: His supposed mentor ( Austin Pendleton ) betrays him, and he\u2019s brutally brushed off by the editor of a prestigious journal on sound, to which he\u2019s submitted a paper on his theory that human behavior is determined by subliminal tones\u2014Central Park is in G; Wall Street is B-minor; the Lower East Side is A-flat. Most of what we regard as noise\u2014except that defined as white noise\u2014actually possesses a tone. Peter has found one on each block of the city.\n\nEllen rejects Peter\u2019s theory, which she regards as a kind of predestination. They talk at cross purposes. Is anyone listening? Not when they should be, it seems: During their initial meeting, Peter asks Ellen, \u201cDo you walk to work?\u201d\u2014to which she responds by telling him how satisfying she finds her job. It\u2019s not deafness, exactly. Peter\u2019s \u201chome tuning\u201d is about addressing the sound people don\u2019t even know they\u2019re listening to, and can\u2019t help hearing. But they don\u2019t listen to each other, either, and a new toaster won\u2019t fix that.\n\n\u2014Mr. Anderson is a Journal TV critic.
