I would love to be on the Olympic team.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThompson was a key player off the bench on the 2016 gold medal team, finishing fifth with 9.9 points per game. However, he shot only 36.4 percent from the field, including 32.7 percent from beyond the arc.\n\nEven though his scoring was uneven in Rio de Janeiro, outside shooting is even more key in international play with a shorter 3-point line and more forms of zone defense allowed.\n\nThompson joins a growing list of NBA stars throwing their names into the ring for the 2020 games. Just this week, Thompson\u2019s teammate Stephen Curry \u2014 who missed the 2016 Olympics because of knee and ankle injuries \u2014 and Damian Lillard committed to playing in Tokyo.\n\nThe trio of All-NBA guards were on USA Basketball\u2019s initial list of 35 players under consideration for the FIBA World Cup, but none of them ended up playing. Even before tearing his ACL in the NBA Finals, Thompson indicated he was unlikely to play.\n\nWith dozens of other stars\u2019 withdrawals, Team USA wound up in a disappointing seventh-place finish, which led to Jerry Colangelo calling out players who didn\u2019t want to play in smaller tournaments. It\u2019s early, but Colangelo should have a much stronger roster next summer.\n\nWarriors shooting guard Klay Thompson hopes to play in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. (AP Photo/Tony Avelar)\n\nWill Thompson recover in time for the Olympics?\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s completely understandable that Thompson would want to compete in a second straight Olympic Games, but it\u2019s an entirely different question if he\u2019ll be able to come back.\n\nThe earliest timelines for Thompson peg him for a February return, but that may be a tad aggressive. Look no further than Derrick Rose, who missed the entire 2012-13 season while recovering from the same injury.\n\nThere\u2019s not only the concern of when Thompson will be able to play again but whether he will have the same athleticism. Rose never reached his MVP level again after the initial injury and has battled health issues ever since.\n\nThis is not to say that Thompson will never be the same, but it\u2019s conceivable it will take time for him to return to form. USA Basketball has a deep roster of guards and shooters to choose from \u2014 assuming players don\u2019t drop out again \u2014 so they may not even want to roll the dice on Thompson, even if he\u2019s willing.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Thompson was a key bench player in the gold medal-winning 2016 team.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5.q4tNEp_PhdslwwbS.1ZQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04ODIuMTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e4Eb8mO52SuAKXzDqQvxDA--~B/aD0yNTc2O3c9MzczODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-06/07aaa6c0-8d82-11e9-97f3-40c5f1547253", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
