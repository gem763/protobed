Pablo Blazquez/Pool via REUTERS\n\nOriol Junqueras, the former Catalan deputy head of government who is jailed outside Barcelona pending a ruling on his role in the 2017\u2019s secessionist bid, answered questions from Reuters ahead of an annual pro-independence march on Wednesday that is expected to reflect the strength and unity of the separatist movement.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that I am innocent and that we have not committed any crime,\u201d said Junqueras, 50, leader of the left-wing Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya party.\n\n\u201cWhat the (Spanish) state pretends with this (upcoming) sentence is to behead a peaceful movement and, as it cannot detain two million citizens, it locks us up,\u201d he said in written responses conveyed by his legal team.\n\nJunqueras is allowed to use a computer without internet access.\n\nHe is one of the 12 Catalan leaders - nine of them jailed - facing charges of rebellion, sedition and misappropriation of public funds for the independence referendum and the botched independence declaration that followed it.\n\nProsecutors are seeking sentences of 7 to 25 years, the latter only for Junqueras.\n\nA ruling by Spain\u2019s Supreme Court is expected soon, likely in October. Spanish authorities have repeatedly said the trial was fair and respects the rule of law.\n\nAs they have done in massive marches since 2012, tens of thousands of separatists are expected to demonstrate on Wednesday in Barcelona on Catalonia\u2019s annual commemorative day.\n\nCatalonia\u2019s independence drive is at a defining moment after internal divisions have surfaced. They will likely determine the direction and strength of a movement that has overshadowed Spanish politics for years, triggering the country\u2019s biggest political crisis in decades in 2017.\n\nJunqueras said he has no regrets and that he had fulfilled a \u201cdemocratic mandate\u201d when two years ago Catalan leaders defied a judicial ban by carrying out a secessionist vote and the short-lived independence declaration that followed.\n\nThe confrontation saw police wielding batons at crowds seeking to vote and prompted the then-conservative government to impose direct rule from Madrid on the region.\n\nJunqueras said that Scotland\u2019s 2014 independence referendum, which was authorized by London, was his preferred option for Catalonia\u2019s next steps.\n\nAsked if he would rule out acting unilaterally again, he said: \u201cWe cannot discard any (option) that is democratic and peaceful.\u201d He also repeated that his party had always backed and sought an independence referendum.\n\nA poll published in July by a public Catalan institute showed support for an independent Catalonia at its lowest level in two years, with 48.3% of people against and 44% in favour.\n\nAssemblea Nacional Catalana, the grassroots organisation behind Wednesday\u2019s march, minimized the decrease but said the lack of a clear separatist road-map could be to blame at a time when pro-independence parties are divided on what to do next.", "description": "Catalonia's highest-profile jailed separatist leader accused Spain of trying to behead the secessionist movement with a trial on the region's failed independence bid, adding that another independence referendum was still a possibility.", "authors": ["Joan Faus", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428570934&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A08X", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
