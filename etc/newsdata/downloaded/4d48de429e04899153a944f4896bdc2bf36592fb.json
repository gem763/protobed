Some readers may find this content distressing.\n\n20 kangaroos have been found dead after a truly horrifying attack in Tura Beach on Saturday night.\n\nResidents of the small town in NSW were shocked when they woke up to a terrifying number of deceased roos over the space of a few streets in their usually quiet neighbourhood.\n\nIn what is believed to be a deliberate attack, more than 20 kangaroos were run down by a vehicle in the area for reasons unknown.\n\nThe totally unnecessary killings took place across Headland Drive, Elizabeth Parade and The Dress Circle between 10.30pm and 11.30, 10 Daily reports.\n\nUnfortunately three joeys, five juveniles and 12 adults were killed in the attack, with another three joeys being rescued by police.\n\nNSW Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service (WIRES) volunteer Janine Green said police contacted her after finding a Joey in the pouch of a roo that had to be euthanised following the attack.\n\n\u201cThere was one injured kangaroo that was not killed on impact; so they had to euthanise her. She had the joey in her pouch,\u201d Green told 10 daily.\n\nGreen was later asked by local police to assist with removing the carcasses from the area, which would\u2019ve been heartbreaking to say the least.\n\nThe remaining three joeys are currently in the care of WIRES, where they will hopefully be nursed back to health before being released.\n\nHowever, the cost of hand-rearing joeys is a whopping $500/day, so it is unclear whether WIRES will be able to keep the animals for long.

Sure, they\u2019re dangerous when you\u2019re driving at night, or if you get too close to them. But for the most part, kangaroos will just leave you alone if you leave them alone.\n\nSo why the heck would somebody want to kill one? Why would somebody want to kill 20 of them?\n\n\u201cThe kangaroos have always lived in the area, and they\u2019re part of a community,\u201d Green said. \u201cTo find them all lying on their footpaths on a beautiful Sunday morning\u2026 it was just sickening, and totally unnecessary.\u201d\n\nThe incident is now being investigated by NSW Police for \u201cseveral\u201d acts of animal cruelty. If you have any information or CCTV of the event, police are encouraging you to come forward.", "description": "20 kangaroos have been found dead in the NSW town of Tura Beach after a horrifying, allegedly deliberate attack on Saturday evening.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-30-at-7.50.14-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
