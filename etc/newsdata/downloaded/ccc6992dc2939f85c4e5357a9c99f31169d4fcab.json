Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) shares immediately dipped dashing the hopes of the big board joining other major equity indices.\n\nThe big news of today\u2019s session will be Amazon (AMZN), which missed big time on earnings, as its cloud business (AWS) came up short.\n\nRevenue $70.0 billion estimate $68.8 billion\n\nEarnings Per Share $4.23 consensus $4.62\n\nAWS Revenue $9.0 billion consensus $9.1 billion\n\nBut the bigger story is mounting cost and weaker guidance.\n\nAMZN Third Quarter Operating Expenses % of Revenue 2018 2019 Fulfillment 14.6% 14.5% Marketing 5.8% 6.8% Technology & Content 12,7% 13.1% General and Administrative 1.8% 1.9%\n\nFourth Quarter Guidance\n\nSales $80.0 to $86.5 billion consensus $87.4 billion\n\nOp Income $2.9 billion (high-end) consensus $4.19 billion\n\nDuring the quarter, the company is going to invest $1.5 billion to fulfill one-day shipping to counter Walmart\u2019s two-day shipping. Manpower is mounting, as an extra 100,000 workers brings US total to 400,000 and the global workforce to 750,000.\n\nI don\u2019t view the company\u2019s lower guidance as a proxy for Christmas shopping, but instead, as a reflection of greater competition. It\u2019s getting real, as brick and mortar survivors are learning the omnichannel game and doing it well. The stock has been down an average of 4.85% in the week after reporting over the last four quarters and will begin today off almost twice as much.\n\nEarnings Winners\n\nVisa (V)\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nJuniper (JNPR)\n\nDecker (DECK)\n\nMohawk (MHK)\n\nMessage of the Market\n\nYesterday, Technology rocked spurred on by that big beat by Lam Research (LRCX). Intel (INTC) doesn\u2019t have the coattails it once did, but its an important tech name that should provide a spark.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering about Amazon, the stock is in the S&P Consumer Discretionary sector. Although its weighting in XLY is only 0.34% versus 22.33% for Amazon, results from Mohawk Industries (MHK) underscore one of my current investment thesis of improved household formation.\n\nS&P 500 Index +0.15% Communication Services (XLC) -1.33% Consumer Discretionary (XLY) -0.07% Consumer Staples (XLP) +0.35% Energy (XLE) -0.63% Financials (XLF) -0.09% Health Care (XLV) -0.60% Industrials (XLI) +0.22% Materials (XLB) +0.26% Real Estate (XLRE) -0.30% Technology (XLK) +1.39% Utilities (XLU) +0.39%\n\nThe results from Mohawk, coupled with Bassett (BSET) and Sleep Number (SNBR) from last week, points to millennials moving out, and not necessarily to big expensive cities, but looking for the old dram home with the white picket fence.\n\nI even believe the current pullback in new home sales median prices is a good thing for the industry, where home prices were climbing twice as fast as wages, which were powering higher.\n\nWe learned in September the median home price slipped under $300,000 for the first time this year.\n\nPortfolio Approach\n\nWe sent alerts that we were closing two positions and taking profits in two positions in the model portfolio. Valero (VLO), but we think there should be some exposure to energy, and Winnebago (WGO), which is such a satisfying grand slam because Wall Street hated the stock, and Main Street media leaped all over the notion the industry was leading the nation into recession.", "description": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average seesawed all session long, but .10/25/2019 19:46:21PM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/307/9d0662c0-2b03-40c7-8e56-f66c5e64e018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
