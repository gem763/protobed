The rule would favor those who are educated and wealthy, more likely to hail from Europe than from the developing world.\n\nThe new standards would directly affect about 1.2 million applicants annually, including about 500,000 who are already in the country. But that figure does not include millions of family members and others who might also be affected. Immigration experts said the rules would disproportionately affect applicants from Africa and Latin America.\n\nUnder the policy, which is still subject to full legal review by the courts, agency officials are to consider a \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d in assessing green card applicants based on a list of \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d factors. Negative factors include being unemployed, not completing high school and lacking proficiency in English. Assets, personal debts and credit score are also taken into account.\n\nHeavily weighted positive factors include having a household income that is 250 percent above the federal poverty line, currently $53,325 for a family of three, or having private health insurance that is not subsidized by Affordable Care Act tax credits.\n\nMost people seeking to obtain legal permanent residency or to immigrate to the United States are immediate relatives of naturalized Americans or have a family-based sponsor. Thus, critics have said, the new criteria force immigrants to choose between the well-being of some family members in the United States and their desire to reunite with those waiting to join them from overseas . A family\u2019s use of benefits could hamper the chances that a spouse in a foreign country would ever be allowed to immigrate to the United States, even if the family members who use the benefits are United States citizens.", "description": "An injunction prevents the administration from withholding green cards to immigrants who receive federal assistance like Medicaid, pending further legal review.", "authors": ["Miriam Jordan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/us/00publiccharge/00publiccharge-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
