I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One.\u201d\n\nThe language of the president\u2019s tweet is a bit surprising, considering his usual tough rhetoric against Iran and the many hostile tweets he has put out in the past. Today\u2019s tweet was exceptionally polite and respectful, and it could be read in two different ways.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

That would be more in line with Trump trying to be respectful towards Iranian leaders and setting the stage for a potential meeting with the Iranian president Hassan Rouhani in upcoming weeks at the United Nations in New York. Iran\u2019s satellite launch attempts have malfunctioned in the past and this would not be an unusual event. Just a few months ago in January 2019, the launch of Iran\u2019s Payam satellite was unsuccessful, as part of a series of other unsuccessful launches in the past.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that an incident happened with involvement from the United States and now Trump is trying to get ahead of the blame game through this seemingly innocent tweet. Iranian officials have accused Americans of such intervention in the past. And the US government has a secret programme that tries to sabotage Iran\u2019s satellites and missiles programmes, according to current and former American officials, and the New York Times reported earlier this year that the Trump White House accelerated that secret programme.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

And US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has slammed Iran\u2019s satellite launches, claiming that they violated a United Nations Security Council resolution.\n\nThomas Juneau, professor at University of Ottawa and former defence analyst who specialises on Iran, told The Independent it was plausible the US was responsible, partly or fully, for the failed launch.\n\n\u201cBut Trump\u2019s tweet was inappropriate in too many ways to count. Morally, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for the president of the United States to taunt an adversary like Iran. The US should behave as a responsible great power; when Trump behaves like a petulant child instead, he hurts the US. It is also not clear where precisely that image came from, but we can see what appears to be a shadow on it, suggesting that someone took a picture of the satellite imagery before Trump tweeted it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is likely that if anybody else than the president had done this, it would have been a security violation. This, again, sets a bad precedent and example.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Iranian officials have claimed that there was no incident. The minister of information and communications technology, Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi, wrote on Twitter: \u201cMany are asking about how our satellite is doing. Apparently there have been reports that the third attempt to launch a satellite has been unsuccessful. Frankly, Nahid 1 is doing well, is in the laboratory, and reporters can come visit.\u201d\n\nHe also attached a promotional video of the Nahid 1 satellite from an Iranian channel.\n\nBut Iran\u2019s denial of an incident is also not enough evidence. Iranian officials have been promoting their satellite program as a token of patriotism and national pride, and it is not easy to acknowledge failures of their program, especially if such failures happen due to interventions from the United States.\n\nFriday is the weekend in Iran. As the Iranian week starts on Saturday, we should have more information from Iranian officials and Iranian media, to better understand what really happened in Semnan and judge Donal Trump\u2019s tweet with more clarity.", "description": "Donald Trump has claimed that the US had nothing to do with reports of a failed Iranian satellite launch \u2013 and sent his \u201cbest wishes and good luck\u201d to the Iranians in determining what happened at the site in the city of Semnan.", "authors": ["Negar Mortazavi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/30/14/trump-satellite-tweet.jpeg"}
