And we will respond with overwhelming military force against any group that threatens the safety of our forces there,\" Esper told reporters at the Pentagon.\n\nPressed on whether the U.S. military mission included denying any Russian or Syrian government forces access to the oilfields, Esper said: \"The short answer is, yes, it presently does.\"\n\nHe noted that the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, relied on that oil income to fund its fighters, including the ones guarding prisons that hold captured Islamic State fighters.\n\n\"We want to make sure that SDF does have access to resources in order to guard the prisons, in order to arm their own troops, in order to assist us with the defeat-ISIS mission,\" he said, using an acronym for Islamic State.\n\n\"So that's our mission, is to secure the oilfields.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has softened his pullout plans for Syria after a backlash from Congress, including among key Republicans who say he cleared the way for a long-threatened Turkish incursion against the SDF, which had been America's top ally in the battle against Islamic State. Amid concerns that Islamic State could stage a resurgence in the ensuing power vacuum, Trump said last week a small number of U.S. troops would remain in the area of Syria \"where they have the oil,\" a reference to oilfields in the Kurdish-controlled region.\n\nThat plan for Syria appears unaltered by the U.S. raid on Saturday that led to the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\n(Reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will repel any attempt to take Syria's oil fields away from U.S.-backed Syrian militia with \"overwhelming force,\" whether the opponent is Islamic State or even forces backed by Russia or Syria, the Pentagon said on Monday.", "authors": ["Phil Stewart"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
