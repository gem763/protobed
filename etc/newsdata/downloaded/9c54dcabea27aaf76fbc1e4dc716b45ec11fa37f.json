The information the new book was bringing to light, Cruz was suggesting to This Week\u2019s audience, was not merely irrelevant; it was in fact so fundamentally inconsequential as to be, literally, laughable. Some things are worth arguing about, and some things are simply not, and Cruz did not need to utter a word to tell you which category he believes the Kavanaugh news to occupy.\n\nRead: Brett Kavanaugh and the revealing logic of \u201cBoys will be boys\u201d\n\nLaughter often works that way in politics\u2014derisive, dismissive, weaponized. The Kavanaugh confirmation process itself, in its tangle of tragedy and farce, was a blunt reminder of that. Laughter was there when pundits, in reaction to Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s initial claim about Kavanaugh\u2014that he had drunkenly assaulted her when she was 15, making her fear for her life\u2014dismissed her recollection by mocking its gravity. (Remember \u201cseven minutes of heaven\u201d?) Laughter was there in the revelation of Kavanaugh\u2019s in-joke-infused high-school yearbook (\u201cRenate Alumnius,\u201d \u201cBeach Week Ralph Club,\u201d \u201cDevil\u2019s Triangle\u201d). It was there in the joking emails Kavanaugh and his inner circle exchanged while he was working in George W. Bush\u2019s White House. It was there in the sneering derision with which Kavanaugh replied to the questions of Democratic lawmakers during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, denying that he had ever engaged in sexual misconduct. It was there in his attempt, unsuccessful but revealing, to turn Senator Amy Klobuchar into a punch line.\n\nAnd laughter is there, aptly enough, in the book that shaped this weekend\u2019s news cycle. The Education of Brett Kavanaugh is in one way, as the past days\u2019 events have made clear, a breaker of news. It is even more powerful, however, as a revision that adds to the existing story rather than fundamentally changing it\u2014a deeply reported retelling of the confirmation fight that many Americans experienced as a cut whose wounds never fully healed. (Pogrebin and Kelly, who also covered the story for the Times as it played out last year, spent the next 10 months both retracing it and filling in the lines.) The process, culminating in the paired testimonies that brought the logic of \u201che said, she said\u201d to a grotesque new level, was about justice both in the most sweeping sense and in the most quotidian. It was a contest that asked questions about what is valued in America, and what will be dismissed. It was a struggle over who gets to tell the jokes\u2014and who gets laughed away.\n\nFord, in her initial letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein, and then in subsequent retellings of her story, mentioned in particular her memory of Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge laughing as Kavanaugh pinned her down, fumbling with her clothes, crushing her under the weight of his body. The way they seemed to be bonding through her panic. The way they turned her alarm into their joke. Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter.", "description": "Far beyond the news it breaks, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh is a grim reminder: Many Americans still doubt the seriousness of sexual-misconduct allegations.", "authors": ["Megan Garber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX6EDPG/facebook.jpg?1568731410", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
