The squad have decamped 700 miles south to Miyazaki and out of harm\u2019s way from what was forecast to be the most violent typhoon since 1958.\n\nOn Thursday, Eddie Jones and the England logistics team took advantage of the cancellation of their match against France \u2013 that was supposed to be played in nearby Yokohama on Saturday \u2013 by flying here, where they were based for eight days before the start of the tournament, just hours after learning the Pool C decider had been called off.\n\nJapan ready to think big after hard years keeping up with Eddie Jones Read more\n\nThat left a number of the squad saying hurried goodbyes to their loved ones, who had travelled to Tokyo in advance of the France fixture. Vunipola, who was denied the chance to make what would have been a welcome first start of the World Cup, also revealed his father and former Tonga international, Fe\u2019ao, was among his family members stranded in the capital.\n\nWinds of more than 120mph hit the Kanto region and torrential rain left 12,000 homes without power. By mid-afternoon there were reports of a first fatality and Tokyo was hit by an earthquake at around 6pm local time. The extreme weather was expected to settle overnight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been chaos, in terms of logistics,\u201d said Vunipola. \u201cWe have families and friends there. That was probably the hardest thing to deal with; realising that the game wouldn\u2019t be on and trying to make plans for them.\n\n\u201cJapan is pretty used to typhoons and they have regulations to deal with it, so it\u2019s just a case of them doing as they\u2019re told and us hoping and praying that they\u2019re safe. We are very lucky to be here and I just hope everyone is safe.\n\n\u201cMy dad has just arrived and my aunties and cousins also came. My auntie has been here for the whole time and my dad has come over for the [France] game and I think he will stay for the Australia game. It is just trying to make sure they are safe and follow what they are told.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re focused on rugby but you know it\u2019s not the be all and end all. You worry for people\u2019s safety in typhoons and you hope nothing serious does happen. But unfortunately there\u2019s already been someone [die]. You just pray and hope that it doesn\u2019t happen too much.\n\n\u201cIn terms of rugby you want to focus on that as much as you can but you realise it\u2019s all about safety, which is probably why they\u2019ve made that call and we\u2019re not playing.\u201d\n\nEngland were not told the match was officially off until Thursday morning but the hooker Jamie George revealed Jones, who earlier this week retold how he was once nearly seriously hurt during a typhoon, had prepared his players for the disruption caused. Jones coached Japan for four years and has spent many more coaching at club level here.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the many benefits of having Eddie as our coach,\u201d said George. \u201cHe told us that there was the potential for this to happen. It came to us as a massive shock to the system, but the most impressive thing for me was how our logistics team handled it all, within a few hours we already had a plan in place.\n\n\u201cI know people who have flown here just for the weekend. We\u2019re gutted for those guys. Trust me, we\u2019d much rather be playing as well but as difficult as it is it\u2019s very difficult circumstances. But it\u2019s hugely disappointing for those guys.\u201d", "description": "England have been prepared for Typhoon Hagibis from Eddie Jones\u2019s experiences in Japan but have been separated from family and friends", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93ddbd2133f20afb82646f1cc725d35d7143756c/21_384_4451_2670/master/4451.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aa4447a2f7c6e4f4482287b54be209f4", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
