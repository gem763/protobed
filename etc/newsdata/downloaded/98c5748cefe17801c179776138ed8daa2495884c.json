The Church denounces any abusive professional practice or treatment.\u2019\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (pictured) have announced their opposition to a new bill in Utah the hopes to ban gay conversion therapy\n\n\u2018We teach the right of individuals to self-determination and the right of parents to guide the development of their children. We also believe faith-based perspectives have an important and ethically appropriate role in professional counseling.\u2019\n\nThe church asks that Utah lawmakers amend the bill to include their beliefs or provide clear guidance on the issue.\n\nState officials drafted the most recent version of the bill at the behest of Republican Utah Governor Gary Herbert, a member of the church.\n\nHerbert asked for a set of formal rule\u2019s to be made regarding the topic in a similar bill drafted earlier this year.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints released a statement on Tuesday (pictured) outlining their hesitation about the bill and saying it impedes on their religious rights\n\nThe Utah Department of Commerce and the Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing were tasked with drafting the original bill.\n\nIn preparation, LGBTQ+ advocates and organizations spoke out in support with hopes that Utah, known for its overwhelming conservatism, would become the 18th state to have laws banning conversation therapy.\n\nA coalition of mental health representatives and non-profit leaders banded together with two GOP lawmakers to finish the task.\n\nThe church said they would not object the bill.\n\nHowever, the bill died after consistent attacks from right-wing groups that claimed the bill would muzzle therapists.\n\nThis time around, the church is taking a much more vocal stance.\n\nUtah Republican Governor Gary Herbert (pictured) asked committees to create formal rules regarding to gay conversion therapy and wants to use 'the best science available' as the basis\n\n\u2018We therefore oppose the proposed rule in its current form and respectfully request that it be appropriately amended to address the concerns raised in Family Services\u2019 comments, or that Utah\u2019s lawmakers provide statutory guidance on this important issue,\u2019 the statement said.\n\nHow their stance will affect the decision remains to be seen, but it would be unsurprising if it drew support from followers and state residents.\n\nThe church, or the Mormon church, is the faith of choice for almost two-thirds of the state\u2019s occupants and almost every state lawmaker.\n\nLGBTQ+ advocate and director for Equality Utah posted a photo on his Twitter (pictured) showcasing the the suicide risks associated with transgender children who undergo conversion therapy\n\nThe Mormon church is the fourth largest denomination in the country and has approximately 16 million members worldwide.\n\nAccording to the church\u2019s website, their general stance on LGBTQ+ and same sex relationships are stringent.\n\nThose who act on their feelings for same-sex marriage face three outcomes: a probation period, becoming \u2018disfellowshipped\u2019 or excommunication.\n\nThe Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing said the new rule could begin as early as next week.\n\nLGBTQ advocate and Equality Utah director, Troy Williams, called the church\u2019s recent statement \u2018profoundly disappointing.\u2019\n\nHe told Fox 13: \u2018The proposed rule would do nothing more than protect LGBTQ children from conversion therapy \u2014 a life-threatening practice that has been condemned by all of the state\u2019s and the nation\u2019s medical and mental health authorities.\u2019\n\n\u2018Studies have found that more than 60% of children subjected to conversion therapy attempt suicide. Suicide is the leading cause of death among Utah\u2019s children, and LGBTQ youth are especially vulnerable.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s long past time to protect our state\u2019s youth by prohibiting this dangerous practice.\u2019\n\nDespite that, Williams and other advocates are supporting Herbert\u2019s request to base the upcoming bill on scientific facts and studies.\n\nHerbert asked the board to use the \u2018the best available science.\u2019\n\nWilliams (pictured) called The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints recent statement 'profoundly disappointing'\n\nWilliams was a member of Gov. Herbert\u2019s suicide prevention task force, but quit after he disagreed with Herbert's handling of the first bill.\n\nIn hearing last month, members of the LBTGQ+ community mirrored Williams\u2019 statements about the risk of children\u2019s mental health and gay conversion therapy.\n\nNathan Dalley, a man who attempted suicide while undergoing conversion therapy, said the process is harmful to children.\n\n\u2018The adults in this room have failed youth, and they failed me. These are professionals that are ignoring the consensus that conversion therapy doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s harmful. It\u2019s been harmful to me,\u2019 Dalley said, according to KSL.\n\nJason Lindow, a transgender man who identified as lesbian before transitioning, shared similar thoughts.\n\nLGBTQ+ advocates and supporters have reminded lawmakers of how a minor's mental health can be harmed when they undergo gay conversion therapy\n\n\u2018I felt like they were trying to break me apart as a person and use the shattered pieces to try and put me back together again.\u2019\n\n\u2018I felt dead inside.\u2019\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association has and continues to vehemently oppose gay conversion therapy.\n\nOn their website, they say: \u2018In the wake of recent popular entertainment portrayals of conversion therapy, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) today reiterates its long-standing opposition to the practice.\u2019\n\n\u2018APA made clear with its 1998 position statement that \u201cAPA opposes any psychiatric treatment, such as \u201creparative\u201d or \u201cconversion\u201d therapy, that is based on the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or is based on the a prior assumption that the patient should change his or her homosexual orientation.\u2019\n\nThe association says they do not believe same-sex orientation should or needs to be remedied.", "description": "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has come out in opposition to a proposed bill in Utah that would ban conversation therapy, saying it would infringe on their religious rights", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/20/19803680-0-image-a-3_1571254560098.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
