All four facilities had provided their coordinates to the United Nations for inclusion on a list to avoid strikes.\n\nRussian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov in a lengthy statement reacting to the report claimed The New York Times had become a \"victim of manipulation by terrorists and British security services\".\n\nHe took issue with a number of details in the report including the anonymity of the newspaper's sources and said that radioed voice commands are not used to pass coordinates to pilots of Russian fighter planes in Syria.\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres announced last month that he was setting up an internal investigation into the bombing of hospitals in Syria that had previously flagged their coordinates.\n\nSeveral dozen medical facilities with links to the UN have been damaged or destroyed by bombs this year.
