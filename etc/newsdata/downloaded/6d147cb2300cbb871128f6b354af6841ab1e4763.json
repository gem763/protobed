Jonah Jameson And The 2019 Version Of Spider-Man's Daily Bugle Has Arrived", "language": "en", "text": "The Daily Bugle, as seen in the Raimi Spider-Man movies, doesn\u2019t make much sense now. (Photo: Sony)\n\nSpider-Man and the Daily Bugle go together like Superman and the Daily Planet or Iron Man and Stark Industries. It\u2019s simply the place the hero always works. Well, considering digital media, YouTube and so on are all the rage now, our \u201cnew\u201d live-action J. Jonah Jameson had to get with the times.\n\nThe Tom Holland version of the character hasn\u2019t been clued into the famous fictional news outlet though because let\u2019s be honest, is it realistic to have a high school kid in 2019 working at a daily paper? They barely exist anymore. So fans were certainly excited to see this classic Spider-Man staple reimagined in Spider-Man: Far From Home, albeit with some unfortunate real-world comparisons.\n\nNow, months after the Marvel/Sony film\u2019s release, there\u2019s a new Daily Bugle on the internet.\n\nIn celebration of the American home release of Far From Home, Sony has launched TheDailyBugle.net. And with it comes a pretty big spoiler for the film.\n\nAs seen at the end of Far From Home, this 2019 version of the Daily Bugle still has the same editor: J. Jonah Jameson, once again played by J.K. Simmons. This time, instead of a hard-arse newspaper editor, he\u2019s a talking head conspiracy theorist releasing videos like this.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to like and subscribe\u201d is not something we ever expected to hear Jameson say, but it certainly makes sense.\n\nThe rest of the site is pretty bare-bones, but there is a sort-of comment section, and four news stories on it, including an up to the minute one about the raid on Area 51. Another, of course, shits on Spider-Man and praises Mysterio.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Sony plans to update this page as the world of Spider-Man expands but, even if it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s still cool to see this piece of Far From Home in reality.\n\nWe\u2019re wondering though, where\u2019s the big exclusive about Spider-Man\u2019s true identity? Surely that would be the top story and video on the site? Maybe further updates are coming after all?\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home comes to DVD and Blu-Ray in Australia on October 23.", "description": "Spider-Man and the Daily Bugle go together like Superman and the Daily Planet or Iron Man and Stark Industries.
