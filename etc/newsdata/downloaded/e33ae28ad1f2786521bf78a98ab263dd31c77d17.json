The author is described as a senior official working for the administration of U.S. president Donald Trump.\n\nThe op-ed criticizes Trump and states that many current members of the administration deliberately undermine his suggestions and orders for the good of the country. It also states that some cabinet members in the early days of the administration discussed using the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution as a way to remove the president from power.\n\nThe New York Times editorial board said that it knows the author's identity but granted the person anonymity to protect them from reprisal.[1][2] The publication of this editorial was unusual because few New York Times pieces have been anonymously written.[3] Trump expressed outrage and called for an investigation; the author's identity drew much speculation in the media, with over 30 senior administration officials denying their involvement. One year after publication, the author remained anonymous.[4]\n\nPolitical environment [ edit ]\n\nThe essay was published on September 5, 2018. During the week that the article was published, the book Fear: Trump in the White House by political author Bob Woodward was being promoted in the media ahead of its September 11, 2018, release date. Woodward's book depicts the Trump administration as being engulfed in chaos and internal opposition to Trump's impulses.[5] The day before the essay's publication, the US Senate Judiciary Committee began public hearings on controversial US Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh. This timing was also two months prior to the 2018 US elections. The timing has been questioned as a possible calculated diversion, although The New York Times editorial board denied this.[1] The essay praised Senator John McCain, whose death occurred 11 days prior to the essay's publication.[6]\n\nContents [ edit ]\n\nThe author of the essay writes that they, and many of their colleagues, deliberately fail to follow some directives from the president when they feel the proposal would be bad for the country, \"working diligently\" to block his \"worst inclinations\".[7] The author writes, \"The root of the problem is the president's amorality. Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making\".[8] The author expresses support for a traditional Republican platform, and particularly the Trump tax policy, while disagreeing strongly with the Trump foreign policy, and taking pride in colleagues' efforts to shift that policy in regard to Russia. The paper's editorial page editor summarized the column's perspective as \"that of a conservative explaining why they felt that even if working for the Trump administration meant compromising some principles, it ultimately served the country if they could achieve some of the president\u2019s policy objectives while helping resist some of his worst impulses\".[1] The author disavowed any resemblance to the so-called \"deep state\": \"This isn't the work of the so-called deep state. It's the work of the steady state.\"\n\nIdentity of the author [ edit ]\n\nThe New York Times has said that they were working with a single author, not a group of officials, and that the text was lightly edited by them, but not for the purpose of obscuring the author's identity. They said that the definition of \"senior administration official\" was that used in regular practice by journalists to describe \"positions in the upper echelon of an administration, such as the one held by this writer\".[1]\n\nThe newspaper's editorial page editor, op-ed editor, and publisher know the identity of the author. Patrick Healy, the newspaper's politics editor, said that no identifying information has been leaked to The New York Times's newsroom. The agreement between the newspaper's editorial department and the author does not prevent the newspaper's news department from investigating the identity of the author.[9]\n\nAccording to James Dao, the paper's editorial page editor, the author had been introduced to them by a trusted intermediary, and the author's identity was verified by background checking and direct communication. Dao said that the use of a vaguely described anonymous identity was believed to be necessary to protect the author from reprisal, \"and that concern has been borne out by the president's reaction to the essay\".[1] In response to a reader's question about whether the paper might have to reveal the author's name, Dao replied \"We intend to do everything in our power to protect the identity of the writer and have great confidence that the government cannot legally force us to reveal it.\"[1]\n\nSeveral theories about who wrote the op-ed have been offered. Some theories looked at which administration officials have a record of using certain words that appear in the essay. Specifically, the theories focused on the use of the words 'steady state', 'lodestar' and 'first principles'.[10] Some offshore bookmakers took bets on who the anonymous author was; Vice President Mike Pence was the favorite at one site, while then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions led the field at another.[11]\n\nMore than 30 senior administration officials have denied authoring the editorial:\n\nU.S. senator Rand Paul suggested that the president force members of his administration to take polygraph examinations. Presidential advisers did consider polygraph exams as well as requiring officials to sign sworn affidavits. Reports surfaced that the administration came up with a list of about a dozen people who are suspected to have authored the editorial.[20] By September 7, Trump said that the Justice Department should open an investigation to determine who wrote the essay. However, the Justice Department would only be able to open an investigation if it is determined that the editorial publicized classified information.[21]\n\nReaction [ edit ]\n\nTrump responds to the news of the anonymous essay.\n\nTrump reacted in private with what was described as \"volcanic\" anger.[22] Via Twitter, he stated that the author was \"failing\" and \"probably here for all the wrong reasons\".[2] He also questioned via Twitter whether the aide was another \"phony source\" invented by the \"failing New York Times\". Trump tweeted: \"If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!\"[3][23] He later tweeted: \"TREASON?\"[7]\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called the author a \"coward\" and said that they should resign.[3] Some Democrats, including Robby Mook and Peter Daou, criticized the author for not doing enough to stop Trump. Representative Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.) commended the author for speaking out against the president, but criticized the author for maintaining anonymity, saying, \"This is the problem with a lot of Republicans, including in the House: they privately say he's wrong, but they don't do anything about it\".[24] Former president Barack Obama warned that the op-ed should be viewed as a sign of \"dangerous times\" rather than as a source of comfort, criticizing the actions of the author as undemocratic.[25]\n\nGeorgetown University political scientist Elizabeth N. Saunders noted that while it is accurate that staff within administrations often push back on the sitting president's views and that staff leak things to the press, the extent to which senior advisers within the Trump administration push back against him is \"essentially unprecedented\".[26] Cato Institute scholar Julian Sanchez questioned the author's motives, believing that the editorial would make Trump \"even more paranoid\" and cause capable staffers to be succeeded by \"loyalist nuts and/or Trump family members\".[27]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]", "description": "", "authors": ["Identity Of The Author"], "top_image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/95/Trump_Anonymous_Senior_Official_Op-Ed.png", "published_at": "2018-09-06"}
