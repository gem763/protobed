'So what's the point of VAR if Aurier is doing tackles like this?' He tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, @mekonmcfc succinctly summed up the thoughts of most fans watching the game. He said: 'How did Aurier stay on the pitch?'\n\nDespite his good fortune in staying on the pitch, it turned out to be a miserable night for Aurier, who was at fault for a number of Bayern's goals.\n\nThe incident comes just four days after Aurier was sent off against Southampton on Saturday\n\nFormer Arsenal man Serge Gnabry scored four goals as Bayern ran riot in the second half\n\nThe right-back, who was sent off against Southampton on Saturday after picking up two bookings, was caught out of position on multiple occasions as Bayern ran riot.\n\nSpurs took the lead through Son Heung-min's opener on 15 minutes but two brilliant finishes from Joshua Kimmich and Robert Lewandowski saw Bayern lead 2-1 at half-time.\n\nThe home side proceeded to collapse after the break as Lewandowski and Serge Gnabry scored to make it 4-1 before Harry Kane pulled a goal back from the penalty spot.\n\nHopes of a comeback were ended minutes later as Gnabry struck again and he added a further two goals to leave Tottenham in crisis as their poor start to the season continued.", "description": "Alaba executed a perfectly timed slide tackle clearance in the first half before Aurier launched himself into the air and stamped on his right thigh and knee - but somehow escaped a booking or red.", "authors": ["Alec Fenn For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/09/19193452-0-image-a-2_1570005233159.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
