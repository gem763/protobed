Canada\u2019s former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Rabould says she was pressured by the Trudeau administration to settle corruption charges with SNC-Lavalin, a move which would have avoided the company being barred from bidding on government contracts. That would have hurt both the company and its workforce, a significant proportion of whom work in Quebec \u2014 Trudeau\u2019s home province.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s critics say his administration\u2014and Trudeau himself\u2014improperly interfered; Trudeau and his supporters claim that he was only looking out for the wellbeing of Canadian citizens and did nothing improper. As ever, the reality lies somewhere in the middle.\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\nAlthough nobody in Trudeau\u2019s cabinet has been accused of breaking the law, the scandal has rocked Canadian politics. Two Trudeau cabinet ministers have resigned on principle, along with Trudeau\u2019s longtime friend and closest advisor Gerald Butts (he didn\u2019t resign on principle, but to make sure he wouldn\u2019t be a distraction. Read into that what you will). Trudeau maintains that he did nothing wrong and was keeping the interest of Canadian workers front of mind, like he was elected to do.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Two things make it worse; the first is the fact that Trudeau has been held up\u2014and holds himself up\u2014to be the champion of Western liberal democracy at a time when that worldview is under assault. There is no shortage of critics who see Trudeau as getting his just come-uppance\u2014for all the talk of \u201creal change\u201d (his 2015 campaign\u2019s slogan) and his being a \u201cfeminist\u201d prime minister, the resignation of two of the most high-profile female ministers makes Trudeau appear like just another run-of-the-mill politician.\n\nThe second is that Canada has elections in the fall; while it was looking like Trudeau and his Liberal party were going to sail to victory and form another majority government, polling in the wake of the scandal has now thrown that prospect into question.\n\nWhat Happens Next:\n\nUnlike Trump, who generates controversy at a dizzying clip, this one looks significant\u2014and rare enough\u2014to leave a permanent mark on Trudeau and his government. While elections are still months away, it looks like Canada could be heading for a minority government that will require coalition-formation. The only question is whether Trudeau and the Liberals lead that coalition or if it\u2019s their Conservative counterparts.\n\nThe Key Number That Explains It:\n\n3 percent \u2014 the polling lead lead the Conservatives currently have over the Liberals, whose support has tumbled in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin scandal.\n\nEven so, Trudeau remains Canadians preferred choice of prime minister, with 32.5 percent of respondents choosing Trudeau over his Conservative counterpart Andrew Scheer (25.2 percent). Which suggests that while the Liberal brand has undoubtedly been tarnished by this scandal, opposition leaders have yet to really capitalize on it. But when it comes time to head to the voting booths in October, Canadians may have a difficult time making the distinction between the parties and their leaders.\n\nThe One Thing to Read About It:\n\nOf feminism and Canadian politics\u2014read this piece in The Atlantic to understand why this particular scandal cuts to the core of Trudeau\u2019s image as a \u201cfeminist\u201d prime minister, and a whole lot of his political appeal.\n\nThe One Major Misconception About It:\n\nThat Trudeau is done, politically speaking. If this scandal had happened in August, then Trudeau\u2019s reelection chances would be in more peril. Still, a lot depends on the next few months, especially if and how the Liberals can change the narrative and shift the Canadian electorate\u2019s focus away from the scandal.\n\nThe One Thing to Say About It:\n\nWhen your campaign slogan is \u201creal change,\u201d you leave little room for error. Or for traditional politics. Trudeau is finding that out the hard way. The next seven months will be the most difficult of his political career; we\u2019re about to see what this man is made of.\n\nThe One Thing to Avoid Saying About It:\n\nNo sex. No drugs. Even Canadian political scandals are boring.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "When your campaign slogan is \u201creal change,\u201d even minor scandals can have major consequences", "authors": ["Ian Bremmer"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/gettyimages-1129036587.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-03-15"}
