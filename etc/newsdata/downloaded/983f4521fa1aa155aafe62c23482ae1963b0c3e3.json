Robert Brown, commander of US Army Pacific.\n\nAs it does in the Pacific, the US Army already has tens of thousands of troops, as well as significant stockpiles of warfighting equipment in Europe, but the service wants to know that it can move more troops and resources into the theater of operations should a conflict demand such a response.\n\n\"Readiness is not only about having the right forces and capabilities in place throughout the theater,\" Lt. Gen. Christopher Cavoli, commander of US Army Europe, said in a statement Monday. \"It's about exercising our ability to quickly receive and integrate forces with our own and those of our allies and partners.\"\n\n\"This ability is critical in projecting force at a moment's notice, our readiness reassures our allies and deters potential adversaries,\" the general added.\n\nThe exercise in Europe will, according to Defense News, be the third largest military exercise on the continent since the Cold War. Last year, the US military joined forces with NATO allies for Trident Juncture, another huge exercise involving 50,000 troops from 31 NATO and partner countries, along with 250 aircraft, 65 vessels, and 10,000 vehicles.\n\nIt was an exercise focused on confronting a near-peer aggressor targeting a NATO ally.", "description": "The Army is planning a massive exercise, one of the largest since the Cold War, where it will practice surging thousands of troops into Europe.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9b9d2f55824d3c3807a84b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
