In its statement, Gatwick said it hoped to consistently reduce boarding times by up to 10%, compared to conventional methods.\n\nLarge digital screens have been installed to display to individual passengers who is next to come forward. One proposal has planes filled from the back in a sequence that calls window seats first, middle seats next and aisle seats last.\n\nThe experiment is being conducted in alliance with the U.K. budget carrier easyJet at gate 101 in the airport's North Terminal.\n\nAbhi Chacko, head of enabling technologies and digital innovation at Gatwick Airport, said in a statement Wednesday that the aim is to find out if boarding by seat number will avoid queues in the gate room and as passengers step on to the plane.\n\n\"By communicating to passengers better and boarding passengers by seat number, we also expect to make the whole boarding experience more relaxing and, potentially, prevent large numbers of passengers rushing forward at any stage,\" he said.\n\nEasyJet operates a priority boarding scheme for passengers who either have paid for it or need extra assistance. The airport said this policy would continue.\n\nFamilies and friends who wish to board together are also able to opt-out of the system.", "description": "Gatwick Airport says it believes the system can save as much as 10% in boarding time.", "authors": ["David Reid"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106212474-1572434458601gettyimages-1132455717.jpeg?v=1572434489", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
