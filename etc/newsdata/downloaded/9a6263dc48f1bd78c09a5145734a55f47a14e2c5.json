The Joe Daniher deal is apparently off the table while Sydney and Carlton have been left in limbo on other key trades. Latest here: https://t.co/tlMHRHCC3o \u2014 Daniel Sankey (@Daniel_Sankey) October 16, 2019\n\nBombers list manager Adrian Dodoro said Pick 5 was never on the table.\n\nHe admitted it was Pick 9 and future pick.\n\n\u201cI spoke to Joe about an hour ago, obviously a bit disappointed but as you know with Joey, he\u2019s a resilient young man and actually through this whole period we\u2019ve grown to respect him a hell of a lot more for the person he is,\u201d Dodoro said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be disppointed as we speak but knowing him and his character, he\u2019s going to come out a better stronger person. We absolutely love him and we think he\u2019ll have a great season next year.\n\nSydney Head of Football Charlie Gardiner said the Bombers were looking for a player.\n\n\u201cEssendon were really clear from the outset that they wanted a player who could replace Joe,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a terrific player and a contracted player. We knew entering the negotiation that it wasn\u2019t going to be straight forward because Joe is contracted and we respect that.\n\n\u201cEssendon were clear that they would like a player and we weren\u2019t able to add a player that was of interest to them.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s also left Carlton stranded with a deadline disaster, with two massive deals going by the wayside.\n\nThe Blues were wanted to grab Swans forward Tom Papley and Suns star Jack Martin but neither deal eventuated.\n\nThe sticking point for Papley came with the Daniher deal also blocked Papley as Swans wanted to give Pick 9 and a future first for Daniher, meaning they wanted the Bombers to the table before dealing Papley.\n\nIt means Carlton nabbed Eddie Betts and back-up ruckman Marc Pittonet for the trade period.\n\nBlues list boss Stephen Silvagni said there was still hope to get Martin in the pre-season draft.\n\n\u201cWe thought we put a reasonable offer to the Gold Coast which wasn\u2019t accepted. Obviously Jack is an uncontracted player so we still have an avenue to get him either in the national draft or the pre-season draft.\n\n\u201cWe have the option to be able to do that. Whether he arrives at our club or not, time will tell. We still feel as though we are in a strong position.\n\n\u201cObviously with Tom he is a contracted player and we worked really hard to get a deal done there. We always knew it was going to be difficult, a lot relied on the (Joe) Daniher deal to go through.\n\n\u201cObviously (it is) disappointing. We were really respectful towards Sydney in that he is a contracted player. It didn\u2019t work out but we have got to move forward.\u201d\n\nNo not a good trade period...but of a shame. Loving Eddie at home too \ud83d\udc99 \u2014 Shelley Ware (@ShelleyWare) October 16, 2019\n\nST KILDA\u2019S MASSIVE SHAKE UP\n\nSt Kilda got Brad Hill, Paddy Ryder, Dougal Howard, Dan Butler and Zak Jones \u2014 all five of their targets, losing Jack Steven, Blake Acres and Josh Bruce.\n\nSt Kilda great Leigh Montagna said the Saints needed to \u201cshake up their list a little bit\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a new look team,\u201d he said. \u201cThey absolutely won this trade period, they were one of the best performed trade periods.\u201d\n\nWith the likes of like of Dylan Roberton, Jarryn Geary and Dan Hannebery set to come back, the Saints have made plenty of changes.\n\nIt was a popular choice of the winners of the trade period.\n\nBravo to St Kilda.
