You can form your own view.

Sir Charlie noted that Brexit continued to weigh on consumer sentiment and that a no-deal departure would have a \u201csignificant\u201d effect on the company\u2019s profits.\n\nLast year was also difficult for the company and even Waitrose, which has fared better than its sister unit, has closed or sold 17 stores since 2018.\n\n\u201cThe lesson of the last two years is that we need more innovation, faster decision making and bolder steps to align our operating model with our strategy,\u201d Sir Charlie said on Tuesday.\n\nThe reorganisation has already led to the departure of a senior executive. Rob Collins has decided to step down as managing director of Waitrose and will leave in January.\n\nMr Collins, who joined the John Lewis Partnership in 1993, said he is confident the new structure is the right one for the future but that there isn\u2019t a role in the new structure that is right for him personally.", "description": "John Lewis has announced that it will merge its two business units under a single management team, resulting in around 75 job losses and a cost saving of approximately \u00a3100m.
