REUTERS/Youssef Boudlal\n\nRABAT (Reuters) - An Islamic State cell broken up last week planned to attack Casablanca and its port, but a Syrian militant who assisted the group remains at large, the head of Morocco\u2019s BCIJ security agency said on Monday.\n\nThe group had targeted economically sensitive sites both in the city of Casablanca and offshore, said Abdelhak Khiame, adding that the jihadists, all aged between 19-27, were radicalized online.\n\nKhiame said the cell was probably the last to pledge allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi before he was killed on Saturday in a U.S. special forces raid in northwestern Syria.\n\nPolice said on Friday they had arrested seven suspected militants near Casablanca and in the northern areas of Ouazzane and Chefchaouen in possession of firearms, bomb-making material, an inflatable boat, diving and navigation tools.\n\n\u201cThe leader of the cell had attempted to join IS in the Sahel but failed,\u201d he said, referring to the area stretching along the southern fringe of the Sahara across West Africa.\n\nThe global jihadist group had then instructed him to prepare attacks inside Morocco instead and an unnamed Syrian had provided him with logistical help,\u201d Khiame said. \u201cThe weapons seized originated from the Sahel region,\u201d he added.\n\nCompared with other North African countries, Morocco has been largely insulated from Islamist militant attacks. Its most recent took place in December 2018, when militants loyal to Islamic State killed two Scandinavian tourists.", "description": "An Islamic State cell broken up last week planned to attack Casablanca and its port, but a Syrian militant who assisted the group remains at large, the head of Morocco's BCIJ security agency said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445837068&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0WO", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
