Brady\u2019s controversial business partner and trainer Alex Guerrero less-than-enthusiastically chimes in from the background.\n\n\u201cThe work don't stop. No matter what they say, no matter what they hate, somebody's still gotta work,\" Brown says, before taking about 17,000 viewers on a tour of the facility, which features rooms named for various tenets of success, like \u201cPerseverance\u201d and \u201cDetermination.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\"Call God. In a time of crisis, all I ask is love, dedication and focus. Stay focused. The devil is going to try to bring you down when you get closer to your goals. The key is, don't let him.\u201d\n\nAntonio Brown went live on Instagram from the TB12 Sports Therapy Center. Alex Guerrero was there with him.\n\n\n\nBrown: \u201cNo matter what they say. No matter what they hate, somebody\u2019s still gotta go to work.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also recommends starting a football USA team. pic.twitter.com/kQBwUv2tZR \u2014 NFL Update (@MySportsUpdate) September 12, 2019\n\nBrown also suggests that creating a USA football team, like soccer and basketball have, might curb the criticism he\u2019s received as of late.\n\n\u201cAll the basketball players and all the soccer players in the world \u2013 they get love and embrace,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe we need a football USA team so the world can love us, because all we get is hate.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nBrown\u2019s status for Sunday\u2019s game against the Dolphins is currently unknown.\n\nAntonio Brown addressed 17,000 followers from his prolific Instagram account Thursday. (AP Photo)\n\nBill Belichick and Tom Brady won\u2019t talk about Antonio Brown\n\nIn addressing the public, Brown is straying from the strategy set by his head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady earlier in the week.\n\nTuesday night, Belichick cut off questions about his new wide receiver at a post-practice press conference.\n\n\u201cOn Antonio's situation, both Antonio and his representatives have made statements, so I'm not going to be expanding on any of those,\u201d Belichick told reporters. \u201cThey are what they are. We've looked into the situation, we're taking it very seriously all the way through the organization. I'm sure there are questions but I'm not going to enter into any discussion about that today. That's where we're at.\"\n\nHe said only that the team is taking Brown\u2019s situation \u201cone day at a time.\u201d\n\nBrady took Belichick\u2019s tactic even further, refusing to take a single question about Brown after practice Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not getting into all that,\u201d Brady said, steering the conversation toward Sunday\u2019s game. \"Miami\u2019s a good team. We\u2019re going to get ready for them, and things that don\u2019t involve me, don\u2019t involve me.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "\"No matter what they say, no matter what they hate, somebody's still gotta work,\" Brown says to about 17,000 live viewers. \"The devil is going to try to bring you down when you get closer to your goals.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/W9xMw9QJujWFH8m3sp_rCA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tSCZhMjvIuzSV94fqfxcfw--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/75e97270-be2d-11e9-b58e-a88dbbc79e1c", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
