Photo-Illustration: James Gallagher\n\nThis week, a woman who can\u2019t stop cheating on her boyfriend, even though she isn\u2019t even getting off on it: straight, in a relationship, New York, 39.\n\nDAY ONE\n\n8:00 a.m. I always wake up at the same time every morning. But my 28-year-old live-in boyfriend always sleeps in until 10 or 11 a.m., so I try to go back to sleep. I stay in bed in the hopes of morning sex.\n\n10:00 a.m. He wakes up and we have some hot, albeit brief sex, doggy style. We\u2019ve been together for 3 years. He doesn\u2019t like morning sex usually; he hates bad breath and that I\u2019m \u201cnot clean.\u201d That makes me feel undesirable, and like I need to be perfect any time we have sex \u2014 shaved, showered, decked out in lingerie. We haven\u2019t had sex for a few days, so that\u2019s the only reason he goes for it today. He finishes, I don\u2019t. I almost never do \u2014 I\u2019m too neurotic. I\u2019ve always had this problem. I come with a vibrator, or if a partner massages and kisses me while I use it. I masturbate a lot.\n\n4:00 p.m. I\u2019m an architect. I work from home a lot, so my schedule is flexible. I like to take weekends to relax and get recharged for the week. I spend my day reading, hit the gym, and go to the park for a few hours.\n\n11:00 p.m. My secret boyfriend texts me. He\u2019s in town for work. We\u2019ve been carrying on an affair for the last six months even though we\u2019re both in long-term relationships and we live thousands of miles apart. \u201cI just landed. Come sit on my face.\u201d It\u2019s too late \u2014 even though my boyfriend isn\u2019t home from work yet, he\u2019ll wonder where I\u2019ve gone this late on a Sunday. I tell secret BF we can meet up tomorrow.\n\nWe had an Instagram flirtation for a months and finally met at a conference where he was a keynote speaker. It was an instant attraction. We slept together the day we met. There\u2019s something about him \u2026 He\u2019s the bad boy, everything my boyfriend isn\u2019t. He\u2019s also older and more established in his career, at the top of his game, which is insanely sexy to me. As far as my primary boyfriend knows, we are monogamous, so it\u2019s all very sinister.\n\nDAY TWO\n\n8:00 a.m. Secret BF texts that he wants to meet up for lunch. His meetings are close to my apartment, and he desperately wants to fuck me in my bed and \u201cclaim\u201d his territory. Although I\u2019m a total deviant for carrying on an affair and lying to my boyfriend, with a man who has a girlfriend no less, this is a line I will not cross.\n\n11:00 a.m. I head to a nearby coffee shop to get some work done. Secret BF texts and says he\u2019s ready for lunch: He\u2019s hungry, so he either needs to eat food or my pussy. I suggest a restaurant nearby.\n\n12:00 p.m. We meet for lunch. He makes me so nervous, and I\u2019m not easily intimidated by people. Generally I\u2019m dominant and confident, but with him, I turn to putty. He\u2019s a celebrity in our industry. I watch him eat a bowl of ramen. After he finishes, in the most cavalier way, he says, \u201cbathroom?\u201d He goes first, and I follow, knocking twice. We fuck in the bathroom of the restaurant, but since it\u2019s been months since we\u2019ve last seen each other, it doesn\u2019t last long. He comes in my mouth. I don\u2019t finish.\n\n2:00 p.m. I head back to the coffee shop to do some more work. My mind is racing with mixed emotions. I hate that I\u2019m a cheater but I can\u2019t walk away from the thrill. I also cheated on my ex-husband, but for different reasons \u2014 he was super abusive so it was justified in my head. This time, my relationship is stable to a fault.\n\n6:00 p.m. I head home to spend the night with my boyfriend. He has no idea about the cheating, and it kills me that I can do this to him. I read an article by Dan Savage that says you should do what you need to in order to save a mostly happy relationship, even if that means cheating. I don\u2019t know that I entirely agree, but it appeases my guilt somewhat.\n\n10:00 p.m. BDSM guy DMs me on Instagram. He\u2019s a guy I met recently at a wine bar who immediately picked up on my kinky side \u2014 I mentioned something about ball gags in my drunken stupor. He\u2019s been in my DMs every day since. I\u2019ve dabbled as an amateur dominatrix for as long as I can remember. I\u2019ve never once had to advertise: These men always pick up on the energy I put out. I do it mostly for fun, but it has its financial perks, too. Sometimes men will give me cash just for meeting me, to set the tone of the relationship. If it\u2019s $500 for a 20-minute coffee, then I\u2019ll know they\u2019re serious. Sometimes it\u2019s gifts \u2014 a pair of Louboutins, or I\u2019ll bring them out as my slave for the night and they\u2019ll have to pay for everything. My boyfriend knows about this side of me \u2014 he likes the money it brings in. At least it\u2019s one thing I can be honest with him about.\n\nDAY THREE\n\n8:00 a.m. I wake up to get ready to start my day. I put more effort than usual into my appearance with the hopes that I\u2019ll see secret BF again. We text a little, but he doesn\u2019t suggest meeting up today. I\u2019m disappointed, but know that I\u2019ll see him tomorrow, since we made plans to hang out for his last night in town.\n\n4:00 p.m. I head home and am so happy to see my boyfriend. He\u2019s unbelievably sweet, and only seems to be getting hotter by the year. I wonder why he isn\u2019t enough for me. Why do I have to be such a terrible person and go behind his back? I\u2019ve tried to suggest an open relationship, but he won\u2019t budge \u2014 he wants monogamy for the most part. We\u2019ve had a few threesomes here and there, but that was years ago, and our sex life now feels stale and predictable. I guess that\u2019s what happens after you\u2019ve been with someone for a while.\n\n10:00 p.m. My virtual boyfriend from London texts me, checking in. We met on a swingers website over ten years ago, but we\u2019ve never met in person. He\u2019s a super successful chef, and we have an incredible bond. It\u2019s definitely an emotional affair. Where secret BF meets my depraved, raunchy, kinky side, virtual boyfriend meets my emotional needs. We talk on the phone often, and it feels so good. He makes me feel safe, accepted, and loved.\n\nDAY FOUR\n\n8:00 a.m. I wake up knowing I\u2019m going to see secret BF today. I\u2019m excited.\n\n12:00 p.m. I spend the morning finishing up some work, but most of it is devoted to primping, ensuring that I look hot as fuck. We\u2019ve planned to meet on a rooftop for drinks nearby, but we only have a few hours because he has another dinner later. It bothers me that he can\u2019t spend the entire night with me, but I know he\u2019s here trying to fit in as many meetings as he can, so I take what I can get.\n\n4:00 p.m. We meet up and I can tell he\u2019s turned on just by looking at me. He makes a comment about my outfit. He thinks the way I dress is unusual \u2014 I wear a lot of men\u2019s clothing, vintage fur, loud prints, and oversize shirts \u2014 but I know it drives him wild. We spend three hours drinking wine, talking, and stealthily meeting in the bathroom to fuck, twice. After the second fuck he finally starts to open up. He tells me that he\u2019s planning to propose to his girlfriend. He says he\u2019s never had what we have with anyone else. His soon-to-be fianc\u00e9e is kind, but their sex life is unfulfilling. I know I\u2019m developing strong feelings for him, but what can we do? Random meet-ups in random cities is the best we\u2019ve got. It gives me something to look forward to.\n\n9:00 p.m. I go home and shower. I don\u2019t want the smell of him on me or my boyfriend might suspect something. It concerns me how good I\u2019ve become at lying.\n\nDAY FIVE\n\n9:00 a.m. I find out about a work event I know I should attend; secret BF will be there but I don\u2019t tell him. I don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m coming just so I can see him, even though that\u2019s definitely an added bonus, since I know he\u2019s leaving today. I wear a fire outfit, knowing I look effortlessly stunning.\n\n3:00 p.m. I run into secret BF and I can tell he\u2019s excited to see me. He comes over and gives me a hug. We exchange a few pleasantries and chat for awhile. He excuses himself to head to the airport. I know he\u2019ll text me as soon as he leaves the building; and he does. He tells me my outfit is hilarious, and that he\u2019ll miss me. I tell him we should have fucked in the bathroom, and he laughs.\n\n5:00 p.m. I head to a meeting and then call it a day. I decide to walk home even though it\u2019ll take me over an hour. I need to clear my head. My boyfriend is gone for the weekend, headed to cottage country with his university bros. He\u2019ll be drunk all weekend and incommunicado.\n\nDAY SIX\n\n9:00 a.m. I wake up feeling like I\u2019m coming down with something, but insanely horny. My boyfriend is somewhere on a lake with his friends, so I leave him alone. He wouldn\u2019t respond anyway. Secret BF always goes incommunicado for days after we see each other so I decide not to text him, either. Instead, I reach out to my hot 20-year-old French man whom I have virtual sex with now and then. We met on Instagram. Well, we\u2019ve never \u201cmet,\u201d we\u2019re just online fuck buddies. We exchange photos and videos; he talks dirty to me in French and it always sends me over the edge. Funny, it\u2019s the only time I have an orgasm this entire week, despite being fucked repeatedly. He\u2019s super hot, and I love that he finds me so sexy even though I\u2019m much older than him.\n\n5:00 p.m. I\u2019ve developed a full-on cold, so I spend all day in bed. I don\u2019t hear from secret BF.\n\nDAY SEVEN\n\n10:00 a.m. Secret BF hasn\u2019t texted in days and I\u2019m getting annoyed. This is what always happens. We spend time together, have incredibly hot sex, and then he goes MIA. It drives me nuts, and every time it happens, I swear to myself that I\u2019m going to end it, and channel my energy into improving my own relationship \u2014 you know, spice it up, maybe go to a swingers club, find another couple to fuck. Anything.\n\n12:00 p.m. Like clockwork, after two days of no communication, he texts me. \u201cHey, I\u2019m engaged.\u201d I respond, \u201cFunny, and you thought to yourself, hey, I should let the woman I\u2019m fucking on the side know.\u201d We have the same conversation we always do: He doesn\u2019t want to complicate things, he doesn\u2019t want heartbreak, he just wants something fun and sexy \u2014 the things we can\u2019t get from our partners. I\u2019m getting tired of this back-and-forth. I let him know that I\u2019m not an emotional robot, and I can\u2019t pretend I don\u2019t feel something for him. He admits that he feels something for me too, but that he\u2019s marrying someone else. Fuck! Why do I always self-sabotage with these toxic men who I know are bad for me?\n\n5:00 p.m. My boyfriend comes home from his cottage weekend. He\u2019s hungover as fuck, but damn he\u2019s looking sexy. I\u2019m so happy to see him. We spend the night together and I take in his smell, cuddling him, kissing him, loving him. I know how lucky I am. Why am I doing everything I can to sabotage it?\n\nGet Sex Diaries delivered every week.
