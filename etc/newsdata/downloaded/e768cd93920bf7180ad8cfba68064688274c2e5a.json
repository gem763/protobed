Polling Shows They Don\u2019t.", "language": "en", "text": "JOHANNES EISELE via Getty Images An economic downturn in the United States would likely boost the political fortunes of Democrats, but most of the party's members are rooting against a recession.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long after the U.S. economy showed signs of a potential economic downturn for conservative media figures to start arguing that Democrats were hoping for a recession in order to tank President Donald Trump\u2019s chances at reelection. \u201cRecession is at the top of Trump haters\u2019 wish list,\u201d a New York Post columnist wrote. Stephen Moore, a Trump adviser, cited his experience with a lone woman in San Francisco for a Washington Times column titled \u201cDemocrats Rooting for Recession.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, columnists did have one data point to back up their contention. Bill Maher, the HBO host and provocateur, had openly declared: \u201cWe have survived many recessions. We can\u2019t survive another Donald Trump term.\u201d\n\nIt turns out the multimillionaire comedian isn\u2019t representative of the typical Democrat.\n\nA new HuffPost/YouGov poll found just 9% of Democrats were hoping for a recession, while 72% were not. Among all Americans, 6% were hoping for a recession, and 70% were not. The group most likely to root for a recession? People ages 18 to 29, 13% of whom were hoping for a recession. A slight majority of the under-30 crowd, 53%, did not want an economic downturn.\n\nNonetheless, 71% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believed most Democrats were rooting for a recession, while just 13% said they were not.\n\nA recession, which economists typically define as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, would likely harm Trump\u2019s reelection chances. In polling, voters are more likely to approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy than they are to approve of his job performance more broadly.\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll also found a plurality of Americans now expect a recession in the next year: 49% said a recession was \u201cvery likely\u201d or \u201csomewhat likely\u201d in the next 12 months, while 32% said it was \u201cnot very likely\u201d or \u201cnot at all likely.\u201d Among registered voters, a majority (56%) say a recession is very or somewhat likely in the next year.\n\nThere was a significant partisan split on the question, with Democrats seeing a recession as likely by a 74%-to-13% margin. Just 30% of Republicans think a recession is likely, while 60% say the opposite. A number of Democratic-leaning subgroups also thought a recession was coming. A majority of women, 18-to-29-year-olds and African Americans all thought an economic downturn was likely.\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov\u2019s nationally representative opinion polling. More details on the polls\u2019 methodology are available here. Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some but not all potential survey errors. YouGov\u2019s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate.
