He was just strangling me and I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said, telling jurors she thought she was \u201cgoing to die\u201d.\n\nUK: Paedophile Illegal Migrant Killed Christian Convert Wife After Visa Row https://t.co/KYVqN6pHjZ \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 7, 2019\n\nDescribing the attack as a \u201cdetermined attempt\u201d to rape the unnamed teenager, who was sexually touched by Meridja while he strangled her and tried to pull down her trousers, sentencing judge Maria Lamb noted that \u201cThis incident only ended because she got away from you and not because you desisted.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe fled and fell down the stairs during the course of it\u2026 and was helped by a bus driver,\u201d the judge recalled, adding that she commended \u201cthe public spiritedness and responsible [action] taken by the lady bus driver who helped a young woman clearly in distress.\u201d\n\nThe migrant was only given a prison sentence of seven and a half years, however \u2014 and it is typically the case that criminals in England given so-called determinate sentences are automatically released on licence at the halfway point in their terms.\n\nCriminals handed extended determinate sentences can be held in custody for longer \u2014 generally two-thirds of their sentence \u2014 but local court reports give no indication that Meridja received such a sentence.\n\nUK: Just Five Per Cent of Illegal Migrants Sent Back, Thanks to \u2018Completely Useless\u2019 EU Rules https://t.co/PtSbLQjKM2 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 9, 2018\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "An illegal migrant who entered Britain via France after hiding in a lorry has been jailed for strangling and sexually assaulting a teenager.", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/attempted-rapist-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
