He came back and played a couple of games, maybe played through the pain barrier.\n\n\u201cHe had a scan after the Arsenal game and maybe needed a few weeks\u2019 rest in a boot so hopefully he won\u2019t be too long, but he won\u2019t make this game, no.\u201d\n\nDe Gea was forced off with a leg muscle injury in during Spain\u2019s European Championship qualifier against Sweden on Tuesday and Solskjaer said he is also likely to miss the Liverpool game at Old Trafford.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll be out. It certainly looked like it anyway judging on last night so it\u2019s just one of those things,\u201d Solskjaer said.\n\nUnited is in 12th place, 15 points adrift of Premier League leader Liverpool ahead of Sunday\u2019s game between the fierce rivals.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says midfielder Paul Pogba has been ruled out of Sunday's Premier League game against Liverpool, while goalkeeper David De Gea is unlikely to recover in time for the match.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
