The pullback only concerns \u201ctwo very small detachments\u201d \u2014 meaning less than 25 people in total \u2014 that have been moved a \u201cvery short distance,\u201d the official says.\n\nThe White House announced Sunday that the U.S. had reached an agreement with Turkey under which U.S. troops would withdraw from the border area. That, critics said, would allow Turkey to launch an invasion of Kurdish-held areas once protected by the U.S., leading to fears that the Kurds, who helped the U.S. fight the so-called \u201cIslamic State\u201d (ISIS), would be wiped out. Turkey has long cracked down on Kurdish nationalists in the region.\n\nTrump tweeted, in justification of his decision, that \u201cit is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN.\u201d\n\nHowever, he also warned: \u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!).\u201d\n\nHe did not mention the Kurds specifically in his warning, but said he would hold Turkey accountable for \u201cwatch[ing] over\u201d captured ISIS fighters.\n\nJoel B.
