Democrats were not merely proposing massive societal upheaval but mass coercion.\n\nCNN says it\u2019s a \u201ccrisis,\u201d though, so Democrats were free to offer one insane Nostradamus-like prediction after the next. Not only is every weather event now a manifestation of global warming, but Beto O\u2019Rourke says our communities will soon be \u201cuninhabitable,\u201d and Pete Buttigieg says the challenge of warming is on par with World War II, a conflict that took more than 400,000 American lives and tens of millions of others.\n\nNone of this hysteria, as far as I can tell, was challenged during those seven hours.\n\nAs Joel Pollak notes, at this point climate change \u201cis primarily experienced as a mass hysteria phenomenon,\u201d a collective illusion of a massive threat. Just listen to audience members earnestly asking questions based on the risible premise that we\u2019re on the brink of extinction. It\u2019s really one of the tragedies of our age that so many anxious young people have been brainwashed into believing they live on the cusp of dystopia when, in fact, they\u2019re in the middle of a golden age \u2014 an era with less war, sickness, poverty, and suffering than any in history.\n\nWhen Joe Biden, the \u201cmoderate\u201d front-runner, was asked by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper if the Green New Deal \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s unifying climate plan that bans all fossil fuels, 99 percent of cars and planes, and meat within the next decade \u2014 \u201cgoes too far,\u201d or whether it was \u201cunrealistic, promising too much\u201d (\u201cpromising,\u201d of course, suggests that GND\u2019s goals are desirable), he answered, \u201cNo, no it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the Green New Deal \u2014 which also promises to \u201cretrofit\u201d every building in the entire country and provide government-guaranteed jobs, free higher education, and salubrious diets to all Americans \u2014 \u201cdeserves an enormous amount of credit,\u201d said the front-running candidate of the nation\u2019s serious party.\n\nAnd though the most effective way to lower carbon emissions \u2014 the one that allows us to outpace signees of the vaunted Paris Accord \u2014 has been fracking, most Democrats, it seems, now oppose that as well.\n\nCandidate Elizabeth Warren, who\u2019s now adopted Jay Inslee\u2019s plan to force every American to surrender fossil fuel and nuclear energy in 20 years, claims solar panels are the way forward. To put this in perspective, remember that natural gas makes up about 23 percent of our energy consumption while renewables make up about 11 percent. Only 8 percent of that 11 percent is solar energy \u2014 much of it both already subsidized and mandated by government.\n\nAmericans use about 19.96 million barrels of petroleum products per day. To replace it, we\u2019d have to create millions of unproductive taxpayer-funded jobs, layer every inch of available land with solar panels and windmills, and then pray to Gaia that every day is simultaneously sunny and windy. All for the low cost of $93 trillion.\n\nHow? The \u201cnorms of democracy\u201d crowd hasn\u2019t yet chimed in on Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 contention that she would reach across the aisle and demand Republicans pass her plan; and then, if they didn\u2019t, alter the entire U.S. economy via executive action and get rid of the Senate filibuster \u2014 which will now be within her power, I guess, since we\u2019re in a crisis.\n\nThen again, when you\u2019re in a crisis, all kinds of ugly things seem reasonable. Take the anti-humanism that\u2019s long been connected to environmentalism.\n\nOne town hall audience member asked the bureaucrat Juli\u00e1n Castro if our children should \u201ccontinue the cycle of family.\u201d Can you imagine being so taken in by a Malthusian panic that you\u2019re seriously pondering whether perpetuating mankind is a good idea?\n\nAbortion, of course, has been a part of environmentalist plans for a long time. When Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said she \u201cthought that at the time Roe (v. Wade) was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don\u2019t want to have too many of,\u201d she was right.\n\nIt\u2019s no accident that Al Gore argued that we \u201chave to have ubiquitous availability of fertility management\u201d in the developing world as a way of controlling population to stop climate change. The Sierra Club and other environmentalist groups have long warned us that too many babies in Africa and Asia will destroy the Earth. \u201cThe Population Bomb\u201d is widely accepted by environmentalists, although its chief prophets have long been discredited.\n\n\u201cHuman population growth has more than doubled in the past 50 years. The planet cannot sustain this growth,\u201d one CNN audience member told Bernie Sanders, who agreed, promising to back more U.S. funding for abortions in the developing world. Sanders believes women in Asia and Africa should abort their babies to save the world while he shuttles between his main house and one of his two dachas.\n\nSanders opposes the two greatest antidotes to poverty and suffering: affordable energy and capitalism. And others are now following him.\n\nYou might not believe Democrats\u2019 efforts are particularly dangerous, since they\u2019re mostly unworkable. But sooner or later, converts to utopianism are going to start demanding that rhetoric, which is always ratcheting up to new apocalyptic heights, align with policy. That\u2019s dangerous.", "description": "Democrats are proposing climate-change policies that would not only require massive societal upheaval but mass coercion to enforce.", "authors": ["David Harsanyi"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Climate-change-hysteria.v2-e1567706816297.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
