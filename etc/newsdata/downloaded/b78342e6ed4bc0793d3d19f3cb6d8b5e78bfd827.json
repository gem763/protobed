Verizon said it will roll out 5G coverage in 20 new cities across the U.S. They include: Atlanta Boston, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dallas, Des Moines, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Little Rock, Memphis, Phoenix, Providence, San Diego, Salt Lake City and Washington DC. To take advantage of the new speeds customers will need to use a 5G capable phone. Verizon is covering that end by offering the Galaxy S10 5G -- the first 5G compatible device to be sold in the U.S.\n\n\u2018Apple's move to introduce all three 5G iPhones will increase carriers' confidence to invest,\u2019 Eddie Han, an analyst at Market Intelligence & Consulting Institute, told Nikkei.\n\nWhen Samsung launched its 5G phones in partnership with Verizon, the provider offered 5G service in 20 US cities and promised to add coverage in another 10 by the end of the year.\n\n5G coverage is reputed to be between ten and twenty times faster than 4G networks.\n\nInvestors believe 5G could dramatically reshape the mobile marketplace.\n\n5G coverage would make it possible to download a 4K movie in a matter of seconds, something which could change the way people think about content on their mobile devices.\n\nIn China, the town of Wuzhen, just outside Shanghai, was retrofitted to be the country\u2019s first 5G town, with networks that can transmit 1.7GB of data per second.\n\nThe high-speed data networks could also make it easier for smart device to spread into daily life, powering semi-autonomous vehicles, smart ambulances, internet connected factory equipment, and much more.", "description": "Apple has big expectations for its oft-rumored 5G iPhone, which its rumored to be released in 2020.
