The BBC reported that he died of cancer.", "description": "Brian Barnes, a larger than life character who once beat Jack Nicklaus twice on the same day in the Ryder Cup, died on Monday aged 74, the European Tour announced.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
