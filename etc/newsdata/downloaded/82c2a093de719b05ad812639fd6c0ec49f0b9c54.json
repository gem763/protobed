Companies have sold us an increasing amount of stuff, in an increasing amount of plastic packaging, much of which cannot be easily recycled.\n\nThis seems to have been done out of a combination of laziness (they couldn\u2019t be bothered), and profiteering (they would have made a little less money).\n\nIt also involved taking us for a ride, as most of us stupidly thought a lot of the offending plastic was being recycled, but no, from crisp packets to supermarket meat trays, it couldn\u2019t be.\n\nThis disposable ideology was dominant as capitalism and the consumer economy rampaged through the world, raising living standards but unfortunately trashing the planet in the process.\n\nWe\u2019ve belatedly wised up to that not being such a great idea, but what can we do about this linear economy problem?\n\nThe answer, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, founded by the famous British yachtswoman, is to adopt the philosophy of the circular economy instead.\n\n\u2018A circular economy is based on the principles of designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems\u2019, it says.\n\nLet's go round again: The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, founded by the famous British sailor, pictured, promotes the circular economy, which is based on the principles of designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems.\n\nThis week a Circular Economy fund was launched by Blackrock, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s latest partner, to offer ordinary investors the chance to support \u2013 and hopefully profit from \u2013 firms adopting the approach.\n\nBlackrock says it wants to drive investment in firms contributing to and benefiting from the transition to a circular economy.\n\nPresumably, it has also spotted an opportunity to leap aboard a bandwagon gathering momentum, something neatly illustrated by a walk to the tube after the launch event that took me through the burgeoning Extinction Rebellion camp at Trafalgar Square.\n\nThe Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s expertise lies in how it helps firms big and small embrace the concept of the circular economy, rather than keep ploughing ahead with take-make-break business as usual.\n\nIt also gives a leg-up to those companies doing the innovative things that can make a difference in creating a better way of doing stuff.\n\nIt\u2019s easy and tempting to dismiss this type of stuff as green washing, yet if you think about it properly it is hugely important.\n\nA sudden global shift to socialism isn\u2019t going to happen, so we need to get capitalism on side\n\nGetting money to the innovators and encouraging existing businesses to change their ways is essential to stemming the pollution and waste the modern world churns out and to meeting climate targets, such as the 1.5 degree global warming cap.\n\nDespite what some of the more deluded Extinction Rebellion campers may believe, a sudden global shift to socialism isn\u2019t going to happen, so we need to get capitalism on side.\n\nSpeaking at the fund launch this week, Ellen MacArthur Foundation CEO Andrew Morlet spoke of three key areas for it, plastics, food and fashion and said that 45% of the world\u2019s carbon emissions come from how we make and use products and produce what we eat.\n\nAll the things we are exhorted to do personally can collectively make a difference, but to really improve the situation wide-scale change at government and big company level is needed.\n\nMaybe it doesn\u2019t go far enough, but Unilever\u2019s decision to halve its use of new plastics by 2025 is worth far more than any of us could ever put in our recycling bins.\n\nThe circular economy idea also tackles something that really bugs me - and I suspect many of our readers too: the infuriating wastefulness of our disposal society, where it is cheaper to throw something away than get it fixed.\n\nI for one will back any philosophy that espouses getting a toaster mended rather than lobbing it into landfill.", "description": "What's dubbed the linear economy can be seen throughout our world: from appliances that can't be fixed, to plastic packaging that can't be recycled, but there is another philosophy we could adopt", "authors": ["Simon Lambert For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
