Think of Jenn Ashworth\u2019s Fell, set on the eerie mudflats of Morecambe Bay, or Kerry Andrew\u2019s Swansong, with its ominous dead birds, as well as the recent anthologies The Fiends in the Furrows and This Dreaming Isle.\n\nThese stories don\u2019t have to be supernatural. The \u201chorror\u201d in folk horror can often stem from isolation, and the permission remoteness seems to give to human depravity, as in Fiona Mozley\u2019s Booker-shortlisted Elmet and Benjamin Myers\u2019 The Gallows Pole, each set in rural Yorkshire. In both, seclusion enables violence. What makes them \u201cfolk horror\u201d is the way the brutality in them emerges from places with violent histories that still linger, ghost-like, in the landscape. The forthcoming Pine, the debut novel from Francine Toon, centres on mysterious disappearances in the Scottish Highlands. In Adam Nevill\u2019s The Reddening, a journalist moves to the coast to try to start a new life but finds herself troubled by the discovery of ancient remains in a local cave.\n\nThis year\u2019s summer cinema hit Midsommar was explicitly billed by its director Ari Aster as a \u201ccontribution to the folk horror subgenre\u201d, in homage to The Wicker Man. In that earlier film, the protagonist Sergeant Howie is dispatched to Summerisle in the course of his duty. But in Midsommar the main character, Dani, agrees to attend the eponymous Swedish festival in the hope that it will repair her relationship with her boyfriend and, more importantly, help her come to terms with the deaths of her sister and parents. She is charmed by a promise of deliverance, just as Juliette in my new novel Starve Acre is drawn from Leeds to the Yorkshire Dales, trusting in the \u201cgoodness of country living\u201d.\n\nPart of folk horror\u2019s role is to unearth forgotten barbarities and injustices and make us look at ourselves afresh\n\nIt\u2019s a recurring motif in folk horror that the countryside beckons to the characters as a place of hope. That events often culminate in graphic violence is a given: this is horror, after all. What is more interesting is the way in which these stories show how we\u2019re seduced by the idea that the natural world is where we\u2019ll find some kind of restoration, enlightenment and, ultimately, peace.\n\nThis has been a pervasive notion throughout history. The same wisdom that equates nature with wellbeing is what prompted Cyrus the Great to build his vast public gardens at Pasargadae two and a half thousand years ago and what led to the formation of the UK\u2019s national parks in the 1950s. In literature, too, the rural is often depicted as a place of refuge. I think of the notebooks Coleridge kept as he tramped the Cumbrian fells in a bid to wean himself off laudanum, full of moments in which the terrain induces in him a kind of euphoric insight. Today we have Richard Mabey, who in his memoir Nature Cure finds a salve for depression in the flatlands of Norfolk; or Helen Macdonald, in H Is for Hawk, who grapples with bereavement as she trains her goshawk, Mabel. In Raynor Winn\u2019s recent book, The Salt Path, it\u2019s against the windswept cliffs of the south-west coast that the consequences of terminal illness are calibrated.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle in The Wicker Man (1973). Photograph: Allstar/British Lion/Studiocanal\n\nWhen Wordsworth says \u201cLet nature be your teacher\u201d, it seems like sound advice. The trouble is, the classroom is falling apart. The recent State of Nature report concludes that almost a quarter of mammals and half of birds in the UK are under threat of extinction from a combination of climate change, farming practices, pollution and the construction of new housing estates, making it \u201cone of the most nature-depleted countries in the world\u201d. The urgency to preserve \u2013 in direct action and in literature \u2013 the habitats that shaped us and shape us still has never been stronger. And although the tales of ghosts, sacrifice, devils and debauchery are unsettling, folk horror plays an important role in this process.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that its popularity has risen with that of \u201cnature writing\u201d. Like the best examples of that genre, it is concerned with a conservation of particulars. It engages in a deep mapping of place, connecting layers of history, ecology, folklore and memory. It accommodates the supernatural and the eldritch, both of which are often ramped up to provide the horror. But, artistic licence aside, they remain a significant part of the totality of rural Britain, which is haunted by its past \u2013 perhaps even cursed because we\u2019ve buried our unpalatable actions so deeply. Part of folk horror\u2019s role is to unearth forgotten barbarities and injustices and make us look at ourselves afresh. It was on England\u2019s clouded hills that we built our gallows \u2013 an image of cruelty rendered so starkly in Michael Reeves\u2019s 1968 film Witchfinder General, and which greatly alarms Fanshawe in MR James\u2019s 1925 story \u201cA View from a Hill\u201d. Scanning the idyllic English countryside with a strange pair of binoculars, he suddenly lights upon a scene from the past and sees \u201csomething hanging on the gibbet\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stark \u2026 Michael Reeves\u2019s Witchfinder General (1968) Photograph: Ronald Grant\n\nAs polemic, folk horror can perform a needful check on the indiscriminate romanticising of ourselves and our country. It can be an antidote to the jingoism that arises when nostalgia is cut with nationalism and moments of history are co-opted by the right or the far right. Recently, the anti-Muslim group Britain First dubbed their repugnant vigilante patrols of the south coast \u201cOperation White Cliffs\u201d, and Conservative Brexiters are fond of evoking the famous \u201cBritish pluck\u201d of the second world war in response to the perceived machinations of the EU. What\u2019s being peddled here is the myth that the country of our forebears was, if not peaceful, then at least somehow more understandable than ours. People were decent, the \u201cright\u201d sort were in power, the law was respected, morals upheld, the lines between \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d, \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d, more clearly defined, cause and effect more obviously coupled. The past was more coherent \u2013 which, in hindsight, the past always seems to be.\n\nIt\u2019s this kind of dangerous, atavistic fantasy that folk horror takes to task; indeed, much of the \u201chorror\u201d is predicated on the willingness of seemingly ordinary people to believe these claims. In The Wicker Man, Sergeant Howie\u2019s investigation into a girl\u2019s disappearance is frustrated because he is battling against the will of an entire community, and for all his bluster about their pagan beliefs, he is conscious that the islanders live by a common and unshakeable faith in their practices. In Midsommar, it\u2019s the appearance of communal unity that seemingly appeals to Dani when she arrives at H\u00e5rga for the festival. Strange though the place is, the very fact the community is celebrating something that\u2019s part of a larger natural cycle is evidence of a consistency and stability lacking in her life. There\u2019s a philosophy that underpins everything. Everyone has a role to play. Power is localised and tangible. And so to live in a community where the individual is not only able to grasp that power, but is an inherent part of its potency, is an attractive proposition in an era of relativist truths, fractured democracy, global environmental threats and a society in which the spheres of influence are ineffably remote.\n\nThat we\u2019ve been diminished in some way by swapping the rituals of small community for the rituals of global capitalism feels true, but since rural utopias always turn rotten in folk horror, they do not hold the solution to a better way of living. Rather it\u2019s through the experience of seeing them unmasked that we\u2019re awakened to the struggle we\u2019re embroiled in here and now. Individuals in folk horror are shown to be so weak against much bigger forces \u2013 religious, political or preternatural \u2013 that they run the risk of being crushed entirely. Or else they become the force, which is perhaps the greatest horror of all.\n\n\u2022 Andrew Michael Hurley\u2019s Starve Acre is published by John Murray.", "description": "After films like The Wicker Man and Midsommar, grisly visions of the countryside have made the leap from screen to page, writes horror author Andrew Michael Hurley", "authors": ["Andrew Michael Hurley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/069bf58082be94fbbcea0da2ca567848ef201992/799_1299_4502_2701/master/4502.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a1151f16a0563d67fb86585e71960297", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
