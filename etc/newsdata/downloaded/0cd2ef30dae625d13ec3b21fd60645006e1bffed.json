(Michael Reaves/Getty Images)\n\nThe visuals appeared grim on Sunday afternoon when Giants running back Saquon Barkley landed awkwardly on his right ankle while trying to elude a tackle from Bucs safety Mike Edwards late in the first half.\n\nBarkley headed for the locker room after that play and returned on crutches with a protective boot on his foot. But the news wasn\u2019t as bad as initially feared: Tests revealed only a high-ankle sprain and no broken bones, which means the 2018 rookie of the year should be back for the Giants this season.\n\n[How to replace Saquon Barkley in your fantasy football lineup]\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not out for the season,\u201d Barkley said, per NJ.com. \u201cI\u2019m going to do whatever I can to get back as quickly as possible. Not for myself, but for my team. That\u2019s what I continue to think about. I caught myself getting a little upset on the sideline just because I wasn\u2019t able to be out there with those guys.\u201d\n\nNFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport reported Monday that Barkley will miss \u201cthe next several weeks.\" ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter, meanwhile, wrote Monday that Barkley\u2019s MRI exam revealed the high-ankle sprain and put the timetable at \u201canywhere from 4-8 weeks,\u201d with the longer timeline \u201cconsidered more likely.\"\n\nThe Giants\u2019 bye week this season is not until Week 11, and Schefter seemed to suggest that Barkley could return for New York\u2019s final six games.\n\nBarkley had eight carries for just 10 yards while also catching four passes for 27 yards before the injury Sunday. He has 237 rushing yards and a touchdown this season. Third-year pro Wayne Gallman (five rushes, 13 yards on Sunday) likely will assume starting running back duties while Barkley is out.\n\nEven while injured, Barkley was able to hobble his way into the Giants\u2019 celebration after their first win of the season, secured when Bucs place-kicker Matt Gay missed a 34-yard field goal as time expired.\n\n\u201cEven though I know I\u2019m not playing, I know I can impact the team with my voice,\u201d Barkley said after Daniel Jones led the Giants back from a 28-10 halftime deficit. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to get back out there. I wanted to tell my team how happy I am, how proud I am that they worked their tails off and come out with a whole new mentality in the second half, built on that.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nDaniel Jones\u2019s debut changes everything for the Giants\n\nRams overcome a slow start and late interception, hang on for a win over Browns\n\nAntonio Brown says he\u2019s done with NFL, blasts Robert Kraft and Ben Roethlisberger\n\nPatriots quickly moved on from Antonio Brown, but Julian Edelman\u2019s injury is an issue", "description": "His injury looked worse than it actually was, apparently.", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead", "September At Pm", "Matt Bonesteel Spent The First Years Of His Washington Post Career Writing", "Editing.
