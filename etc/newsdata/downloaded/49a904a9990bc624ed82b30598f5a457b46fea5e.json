Though he has no formal training in architecture, he not only designed but also built the structure almost single-handedly, using recycled materials, such as plastic for the dome.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done this with my bare hands. It\u2019s all in my head. I\u2019ve also had help, though I have worked on my own as well, of course, a lot. Nights on my own, I think about how to make the project come true,\u201d he explains.\n\nPartly modelled on St Peter\u2019s Basilica in the Vatican, the building stands almost 40 metres high and has several chapels, cloisters and a crypt.\n\n\u201cThis is all handcrafted, it\u2019s plain. There are no straight lines, just curves, which is even more complicated to build,\u201d says Don Justo.\n\nOccasionally, he receives help from volunteers. Angel Lopez Sanchez, 47, first came to visit him more than 20 years ago, and has now dedicated his life to the project .\n\n\u201cI once came to see him and I liked what he was doing,\u201d he says. \u201cI saw him up there and asked him if he needed help, he said \u2018Well, ok yes\u2019. And that\u2019s how I started helping him. I\u2019d come every now and then, mostly weekends because I had my own job. It was like that for years. Now, it\u2019s been years since I left this place.\u201d\n\nDon Justo sold his fathers\u2019 lands to finance the project. The old man says he spends much of the day meditating and praying for guidance and inspiration from God. However, the slow pace of the project, lack of funding and his old age suggest that, sadly, he may not live to see his masterpiece completed.\n\nTree Cathedral\n\nIn the town of Lodi, in northern Italy, a cathedral unlike any other is under construction.\n\nThe brainchild of late Italian artist Giuliano Mauri, the Tree Cathedral is made of wooden structures enclosing trees, causing them to grow in a specific manner.\n\n\u201cFor Giuliano Mauri, the cathedral was the work of art that best represented his idea, his poetry and his artistic philosophy,\u201d explains the artist\u2019s granddaughter and curator of the project, Francesca Regorda. \u201cFor him, it is a work of great labour, but also of great happiness. It is an idea of splendour, to work on growth and life itself. The Tree Cathedral is literally alive.\u201d\n\nEventually, the wooden framework disintegrates, leaving just the trees to shape the cathedral.\n\nThe Lodi cathedral is the third of its kind. Mauri built his first back in 2001 for an outdoor contemporary art exhibition in Borgo Valsugana in the Italian Alps.\n\n\u201cThere is a true respect for nature in his works. They are in harmony with nature, and shouldn\u2019t be considered as new constructions. He used to say that he was not inventing anything, but just building something that was suggested to him by nature \u2013 something that could have already been there,\u201d says Francesca Regorda.\n\nAfter Mauri\u2019s death in 2009, his family took over his latest project in his hometown of Lodi, which is expected to be completed by the autumn.", "description": "Modern-day Sagrada Familia It is a modern-day Sagrada Familia that has been taking shape for more than half a century in the small town of Mejorada del Campo, on the outskirts of\u2026", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/343395/1000x563_343395.jpg", "published_at": "2016-09-08"}
