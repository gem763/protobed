Over several weeks, they coordinated with a top aide to new leader Volodymyr Zelensky and with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani to try to accomplish both, the texts show.\n\nUkraine Trump circle Andrey Yermak Rudolph W.

Giuliani Andrey Yermak Aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Former U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Charges d\u2019Affaires at the U.S. embassy in Ukraine President Trump\u2019s personal attorney\n\nThe excerpts were provided by Kurt Volker, the special envoy to Ukraine until his resignation last week. They were released by House Democratic investigators following Volker\u2019s 10-hour deposition on Thursday as part of the fast-moving impeachment inquiry into Trump. Among those involved were Volker, U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, and William \u201cBill\u201d Taylor, the U.S. Charges D\u2019affaires in Ukraine. They show that Volker connected Andrey Yermak, the aide to Zelensky, and Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\n[Officials\u2019 texts reveal belief that Trump wanted probes as condition of Ukraine meeting]\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the House Intelligence Committee chairman leading the investigation, and Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), said in a letter that the texts released were \u201conly a subset\u201d of all the messages. Read the messages released below.\n\nVolker introduces Giuliani to Yermak\n\nJuly 19, 2019\n\nKurt Volker 4:48 p.m. Mr Mayor \u2014 really enjoyed breakfast this morning. As discussed, connecting you here with Andrey Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky. I suggest we schedule a call together on Monday \u2014 maybe 10am or 11am Washington time? Kurt\n\n\u201cMr. Mayor\u201d in this exchange refers to President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. At this point, Giuliani had already been pushing the idea that Ukraine should pursue specific investigations for months. His efforts included multiple meetings with two of the country\u2019s prosecutors general, according to media reports and the whistleblower complaint.\n\nGiuliani has pointed to such text messages as indicating the State Department was aware of and even supported his efforts in Ukraine.\n\nOfficials discuss goals for the Trump-Zelensky call\n\nJuly 19, 2019\n\nKurt Volker 4:49 p.m. Can we three do a call tomorrow-say noon WASHINGTON?\n\nGordon Sondland 6:50 p.m. Looks like Potus call tomorrow. I spike [sic] directly to Zelensky and gave him a full briefing. He\u2019s got it.\n\nGordon Sondland 6:52 p.m. Sure!\n\nKurt Volker 7:01 p.m. Good. Had breakfast with Rudy this morning-teeing up call w Yermak Monday. Must have helped. Most impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation-and address any specific personnel issues-if there are any\n\nThese texts provide the earliest known example of the participants suggesting Zelensky will need to promise Trump something \u2013 without raising the other side of a potential quid pro quo, though. Sondland suggests he has briefed Zelensky on what to expect on his upcoming call with Trump. In response, Volker refers to the specific idea that Zelensky should tell Trump that \u201che will help investigation.\u201d\n\nConcerns about Ukraine becoming an \u2018instrument\u2019\n\nJuly 21, 2019\n\nBill Taylor 1:45 a.m. Gordon, one thing Kurt and I talked about yesterday was Sasha Danyliuk\u2019s point that President Zelenskyy is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics.\n\nGordon Sondland 4:45 a.m. Absolutely, but we need to get the conversation started and the relationship built, irrespective of the pretext. I am worried about the alternative.\n\nHere comes the first indication that this was understood as relating to Trump\u2019s political prospects. \u201cSasha Danyliuk\u201d appears to refer to Oleksandr Danylyuk, Ukraine\u2019s former finance minister who recently resigned as Zelensky\u2019s secretary of the national security and defence council. Per Taylor, he said Zelensky was wary of it looking like the United States dictated its business to Ukraine. Sondland, interestingly, responds by referring to the \u201cpretext\u201d of the two countries\u2019 conversation and relationship. It\u2019s not clear to what he is referring.\n\nOfficials plan Trump and Zelensky\u2019s July 25 call\n\nJuly 22, 2019\n\nKurt Volker 4:27 p.m. Orchestrated a great phone call w Rudy and Yermak. They are going to get together when Rudy goes to Madrid in a couple of weeks.\n\nKurt Volker 4:28 p.m. In the meantime Rudy is now advocating for phone call.\n\nKurt Volker 4:28 p.m. I have call into Fiona\u2019s replacement and will call Bolton if needed.\n\nKurt Volker 4:28 p.m. But I can tell Bolton and you can tell Mick that Rudy agrees on a call if that helps.\n\nGordon Sondland 4:30 p.m. I talked to Tim Morrison Fiona\u2019s replacement. He is pushing but feel free as well.\n\nVolker sends along word that Giuliani is approving of Trump speaking with Zelensky by phone, and the two of them talk about how they will set it up. (\u201cFiona\u201d refers to Fiona Hill, a former top Russia adviser in the White House. \u201cBolton\u201d refers to then-national security adviser John Bolton. \u201cMick\u201d refers to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.)\n\nVolker and Yermak discuss the call before and after\n\nJuly 25, 2019\n\nKurt Volker 8:36 a.m. Good lunch - thanks. Heard from White House-assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \u201cget to the bottom of what happened\u201d in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck! See you tomorrow- kurt\n\nAndrey Yermak 10:15 a.m. Phone call went well. President Trump proposed to choose any convenient dates. President Zelenskiy chose 20,21,22 September for the White House Visit. Thank you again for your help! Please remind Mr. Mayor to share the Madrid\u2019s dates\n\nKurt Volker 10:16 a.m. Great-thanks and will do!\n\nHere\u2019s the big one. For the first time that we know of, a U.S. official ties Zelensky\u2019s investigative promise to getting a White House visit \u2013 a potential quid pro quo. Volker, importantly, also indicates this was a message conveyed from the White House. And this came before the Trump-Zelensky call, so this was more coaching from U.S. diplomats of what Zelensky was supposed to say.\n\nYermak responds after the call and floats a few dates. These dates have now passed, though, and the trip has still not been planned.\n\nU.S. officials advise Ukrainians on investigation language\n\nAug. 9, 2019\n\nGordon Sondland 5:35 p.m. Morrison ready to get dates as soon as Yermak confirms.\n\nKurt Volker 5:46 p.m. Excellent!! How did you sway him? :)\n\nGordon Sondland 5:47 p.m. Not sure i did. I think potus really wants the deliverable\n\nKurt Volker 5:48 p.m. But does he know that?\n\nGordon Sondland 5:48 p.m. Yep\n\nGordon Sondland 5:48 p.m. Clearly lots of convos going on\n\nKurt Volker 5:48 p.m. Ok\u2014then that's good it's coming from two separate sources\n\nGordon Sondland 5:51 p.m. To avoid misundestandings [sic], might be helpful to ask Andrey for a draft statememt [sic] (embargoed) so that we can see exactly what they propose to cover. Even though Ze does a live presser they can still summarize in a brief statement. Thoughts?\n\nKurt Volker 5:51 p.m. Agree!\n\nHere, Volker and Sondland plot out a potential statement Ukraine might make, in addition to a live press conference where Zelensky (they\u2019ve apparently been led to believe) would make an announcement. Sondland also refers to a \u201cdeliverable\u201d \u2013 apparently a reference to the end result of Ukraine actually announcing the investigations \u2013 and suggests Trump is anxious to get it.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s input sought on Ukraine statement\n\nAug. 9, 2019\n\nKurt Volker 11:27 a.m. Hi Mr Mayor! Had a good chat with Yermak last night. He was pleased with your phone call. Mentioned Z making a statement. Can we all get on the phone to make sure I advise Z correctly as to what he should be saying? Want to make sure we get this done right. Thanks!\n\nGordon Sondland Good idea Kurt. I am on Pacific time.\n\nRudy Giuliani Yes can you call now going to Fundraiser at 12:30\n\nVolker loops Giuliani in on what the Ukraine statement might say. Again, Giuliani has suggested this meant the State Department was on-board with his efforts.\n\nYermak seeks date for White House visit\n\nAug. 10, 2019\n\nAndrey Yermak 4:56 p.m. Hi Kurt. Please let me know when you can talk. I think it\u2019s possible to make this declaration and mention all these things. Which we discussed yesterday. But it will be logic to do after we receive a confirmation of date. We inform about date of visit and about our expectations and our guarantees for future visit. Let discuss it\n\nKurt Volker 5:01 p.m. Ok! It's late for you\u2014why don't we talk in my morning, your afternoon tomorrow? Say 10am/5pm?\n\nKurt Volker 5:02 p.m. I agree with your approach. Let's iron out statement and use that to get date and then Prez can go forward with it?\n\nAndrey Yermak 5:26 p.m. Ok\n\nKurt Volker 5:38 p.m. Great. Gordon is available to join as well\n\nAndrey Yermak 5:41 p.m. Excellent\n\nAndrey Yermak 5:42 p.m. Once we have a date, will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US\u00ad-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations\n\nKurt Volker 5:42 p.m. Sounds great!\n\nYermak has apparently been given a list of things that should be included in the statement. But \u2013 and this is the key \u2013 he wants to get a date for a White House visit before Ukraine makes the commitments. This, again, suggests that the meeting was used as leverage. Volker proposes that they could finalize the statement and then use that to convince Trump to schedule the meeting.\n\nAlso important here is that Yermak refers explicitly to the investigations into the origins of the Russia investigation and the Bidens (Burisma).\n\nDesire for specific references in Ukrainian statement\n\nAug. 13, 2019\n\nKurt Volker 10:26 a.m. Special attention should be paid to the problem of interference in the political processes of the United States especially with the alleged involvement of some Ukrainian politicians. I want to declare that this is unacceptable. We intend to initiate and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes, including those involving Burisma and the 2016 U.S. elections, which in tum will prevent the recurrence of this problem in the future.\n\nGordon Sondland 10:27 a.m. Perfect. Lets send to Andrey after our call\n\nThey appear to be reviewing language intended for Ukraine\u2019s statement.\n\nAug. 17, 2019\n\nGordon Sondland 3:06 p.m. Do we still want Ze to give us an unequivocal draft with 2016 and Boresma?\n\nKurt Volker 4:34 p.m. That\u2019s the clear message so far ...\n\nKurt Volker 4:34 p.m. I'm hoping we can put something out there that causes him to respond with that\n\nGordon Sondland 4:41 p.m. Unless you think otherwise I will return Andreys call tomorrow and suggest they send us a clean draft.\n\nVolker suggests someone is giving a \u201cclear message\u201d that the Ukraine statement should be specific about the two investigations. It\u2019s not clear who that message is coming from.\n\nYermak shares report of U.S. withholding assistance\n\nAug. 29, 2019\n\nAndrey Yermak 2:28 a.m. Need to talk with you\n\nAndrey Yermak 3:06 a.m. https://www.politico.corn/story/2019/08/28/trump-ukraine-military-aid-russia-1689531\n\nKurt Volker 6:55 a.m. Hi Andrey \u2014 absolutely. When is good for you?\n\nThe link here is to a Politico story about the Trump administration deciding to withhold $250 million in military aid to Ukraine. Reporting has suggested Ukraine might not have known it was being withheld, though Yermak doesn\u2019t specifically indicate that this is the first time they are finding out about it.\n\nU.S officials discuss Trump\u2019s trip, withholding military assistance for Ukraine\n\nAug. 30, 2019\n\nBill Taylor 12:14 a.m. Trip canceled\n\nKurt Volker 12:16 a.m. Hope VPOTUS keeps the bilat \u2014 and tees up WH visit...\n\nKurt Volker 12:16 a.m. And hope Gordon and Perry still going ...\n\nGordon Sondland 5:31 a.m. I am going. Pompeo is speaking to Potus today to see if he can go.\n\n\u201cThe bilat\u201d refers to Vice President Pence\u2019s visit to Poland, where he would meet Zelensky.\n\nSept. 1, 2019\n\nBill Taylor 12:08 p.m. Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\n\nGordon Sondland 12:42 p.m. Call me\n\nFor the first time, one of the diplomats suggests the military aid \u2014 separate from the meeting \u2014 is being withheld as leverage. It\u2019s not clear why Taylor believes that. It could simply be that he saw the newspaper stories like the one Yermak shared.\n\nSondland\u2019s response \u2013 \u201cCall me\u201d \u2013 suggests he knows they shouldn\u2019t discuss things in a written form which could wind up in inquiries like this.\n\nSept. 8, 2019\n\nGordon Sondland 11:20 a.m. Guys multiple convos with Ze, Potus. Lets talk\n\nBill Taylor 11:21 a.m. Now is fine with me\n\nKurt Volker 11:26 a.m. Try again\u2014could not hear\n\nBill Taylor 11:40 a.m. Gordon and I just spoke. I can brief you if you and Gordon don't connect\n\nBill Taylor 12:37 p.m. The nightmare is they give the interview and don\u2019t get the security assistance. The Russians love it. (And I quit.)\n\nThe three of them seem to try to salvage the situation. Taylor again suggests exasperation.\n\nSept. 9, 2019\n\nBill Taylor 12:31 a.m. The message to the Ukrainians (and Russians) we send with the decision on security assistance is key. With the hold, we have already shaken their faith in us. Thus my nightmare scenario.\n\nBill Taylor 12:34 a.m. Counting on you to be right about this interview, Gordon.\n\nGordon Sondland 12:37 a.m. Bill, I never said I was \"right\". I said we are where we are and believe we have identified the best pathway forward. Lets hope it works.\n\nBill Taylor 12:47 a.m. As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\n\nGordon Sondland 5:19 a.m. Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign I suggest we stop the back and forth by text If you still have concerns I recommend you give Lisa Kenna or S a call to discuss them directly. Thanks.\n\nAnother big moment: Taylor repeats his concern that military aid is being withheld for bad reasons \u2013 this time suggesting it\u2019s \u201cfor help with a political campaign.\u201d Sondland again suggests they talk about it rather than text, and delivers a lengthy defense of Trump that again suggests he\u2019s mindful of who might see these texts one day.\n\nThis conversation, notably, came eight days after Taylor first raised this prospect, and he apparently hadn\u2019t been disavowed of it during that time period.\n\nAnn Gerhart contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat\u2019s next in the Trump impeachment inquiry, and will Trump cooperate with it?\n\nThree deeply problematic aspects of newly released text messages centered on the Ukraine scandal\n\nLive updates: Trump says the Democratic-led House has the votes to impeach him", "description": "The excerpts, provided by former U.S. diplomat to Ukraine Kurt Volker, were released by House Democratic investigators following a 10-hour deposition on Thursday.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix", "Danielle Rindler", "Editor Focused On Visual Storytelling", "Tim Meko", "Deputy Graphics Director", "Kevin Schaul", "Senior Graphics Editor Covering Politics", "Kevin Uhrmacher"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dTMzWm46WIWLmGzpQ8D4oeNXgl4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ODWRVMKIRGRFMPFBNGOO7TSV4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
