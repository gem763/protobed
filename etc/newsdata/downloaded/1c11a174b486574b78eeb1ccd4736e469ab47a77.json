We will not be licensing this event, it will not be under our jurisdiction,\" he said then.\n\nBenn acknowledged the risks and need to satisfy medical experts, but said also that he felt discriminated against because of his age.\n\n\"I've welcomed the requirements of BIBA to clearly establish that I am 'fit to box',\" he said. \"I have undergone numerous and regular medical investigations to confirm this, including periodic MRI brain scans.\"\n\nBenn said he would have further tests in the next few weeks, including another brain scan, \"to provide clear clarification of my state of health\" and there would be extra safety measures at the fight.\n\nHe has said he wants to fight again for 'closure', and personal peace of mind, rather than any financial reasons.
