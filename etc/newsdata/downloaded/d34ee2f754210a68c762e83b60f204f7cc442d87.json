Cadbury fought for years to trademark its particular shade of purple. Syracuse University tried in 2011 to trademark both the color and the word \u201corange.\u201d Ohio State this year attempted to trademark the word \u201cthe\u201d because if you listen to former players proclaiming their alma mater for TV lineups it is \u201cTHE Ohio State University.\u201d\n\nBut those failed attempts can\u2019t hold a candle to successful trademarks, like \u201cSuper Bowl\u201d (don\u2019t even think about saying those words together in February!) and really common words like Bubble Wrap, Realtor, Jet Ski, Crock-Pot, Velcro, and Ping-Pong. Even singing \u201cHappy Birthday to You\u201d required one to pay a licensing fee until 2016.\n\nThere is a certain irony in claiming copyright over a commonly used phrase in light of the postmodern view that all truth is relative and words and meanings are merely socially constructed. The whole field of intellectual property law depends on words having defined meanings and usages. Of course those meanings are sometimes contested, but the fact that two sides in a debate or a lawsuit argue over the meaning of words is based on the shared assumption that one meaning or the other is actually true.\n\nIn the same way that the Obamas buying beachfront property on Martha\u2019s Vineyard gives the lie to the liberal argument about rising sea levels, the fact that elites want to copyright common phrases suggests that they agree with the lawyers that words actually have meaning. But words only have the meaning that liberals want them to have, when it suits them.\n\nLiberals have managed to twist the meaning of many words. Disagreement is hate. Everyone who might be racist is a Nazi. Saying \u201cI apologize\u201d is now a microaggression (though how one apologizes for that, nobody can explain). A draft \u201cinclusive language guide\u201d at Colorado State University would have discouraged staff and students from saying the word \u201cAmerica.\u201d The Democratic Party has declared that \u201creligious liberty\u201d actually means violating the civil rights of others. Global warming is now \u201cclimate change.\u201d Illegal aliens are simply \u201cundocumented immigrants.\u201d Murdering the unborn is \u201creproductive health.\u201d\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be surprised at the battles raging over how we use words. The English language is composed of over 170,000 words, many of which we \u201cappropriated\u201d from other cultures. New words are added to our lexicon every year, and old words are forgotten and fall out of usage. But there is something more sinister going on.\n\nWhat liberals have done to language is right out of George Orwell\u2019s 1984. They have brought Newspeak to real life. Liberals want certain words to mean what they say they mean, even if that\u2019s not what the words mean at all. Orwell explains what they are doing:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that can ever be needed will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten.\u201d (Orwell 52).\n\nWhat liberals want when they attack free speech and the very meaning of words is this: to eliminate freedom of thought and conscience, by defining out of existence the words that express ideas with which they disagree. Soon we may need to expand the Second Amendment to include the right to bear a dictionary.", "description": "News broke this week that basketball star LeBron James wants .09/12/2019 3:11:54AM EST.", "authors": ["Tom Copeland", "Beth Baumann", "Alex Nitzberg"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/292/53663aa0-4082-4a58-9ccb-93e0f99b5135.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
