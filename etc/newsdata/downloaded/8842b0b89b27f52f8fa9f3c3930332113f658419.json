Like Kavugho, he found it impossible to return to his former job and now cares for Ebola patients.\n\n\"It hurts when I walk past the school where I was teaching, and the children who recognize me start screaming in my direction: Ebola, Ebola,\" Kombi said.\n\n\"We have all been accused of receiving money to say that we had Ebola,\" he said. \"It hurts a lot when your community treats you as corrupt after you've been at your sickest.\"\n\nGIVING BACK\n\nAccusations like this are common in eastern Congo, where many residents see the outbreak as a money-making scheme made up by the government and outside organizations.\n\n\"I was even accused of having received money to bring people from my community to the treatment center, to kill them with the virus and then sell their organs abroad,\" said Moise Vaghemi, 33, who survived Ebola in August.\n\nClick this link for photo essay https://reut.rs/2nRVrha\n\nMistrust and armed attacks against medical staff have slowed efforts to stamp out the epidemic. Even so, health authorities say survivors play a vital role in their communities by showing that Ebola can be overcome.\n\nSome say they draw strength from returning to treatment centers to work as caregivers for children with Ebola, many of whom have lost parents and siblings to the disease.\n\nThe antibodies developed during their illness mean they can spend entire days with patients wearing only partial protective gear and not the stifling head-to-toe suits donned by doctors and nurses.\n\nIn Katwa, outside of Butembo, Noella Masika, wearing blue scrubs, a surgical mask and a hair net, bathed a 1-year-old girl suspected of having Ebola in a small plastic bucket.\n\nMasika lost 17 family members to Ebola, including both parents and two grandparents, but she counts herself fortunate to have survived.\n\n\"I feel compassionate and grateful for the care I received,\" she said. \"I feel an obligation to contribute to the fight against Ebola.\"\n\n(Writing by Aaron Ross; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)", "description": "BUTEMBO, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Arlette Kavugho was discharged from an Ebola ward in eastern Congo in March, but her troubles did not end there.", "authors": ["Zohra Bensemra"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
