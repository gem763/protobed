Even though they have not let us enter, we will make our voice heard today across the whole continent,\" Giammattei said in a video filmed on an airplane and posted by Guaido on Twitter.\n\nMaduro calls Guaido a U.S.-backed puppet seeking to oust him in a coup.\n\nIn a statement, Venezuela's foreign ministry said Giammattei had attempted to enter on an Italian passport, which caught migratory authorities' attention.\n\n\"Once Mr. Giammetti made clear his visit was not for touristic or private purposes, and since he had not been invited by the national executive or with the coordination of the Guatemalan embassy, authorities proceeded to declare his inadmissibility,\" the statement read.\n\nGiammattei later tweeted that he had landed in Panama without incident.\n\nMaduro has overseen an economic collapse in once-prosperous OPEC member Venezuela and is accused of corruption and human rights violations.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Luc Cohen and Deisy Buitrago in Caracas; Additional reporting by Daina Beth Solomon in Mexico City, Clelia Oziel; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Grant McCool)", "description": "Venezuelan authorities on Saturday denied Guatemala's president-elect Alejandro Giammattei entry into Venezuela, where he was scheduled to meet with opposition leader Juan Guaido.
