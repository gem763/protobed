Over the last half century, there have arguably been less than half a dozen: the three-day week in 1974, the winter of discontent of 1978-9, the riots and recession of 1981, the financial crisis of 2007-8, and the current, accelerating meltdown \u2013 constitutional, economic, and cultural \u2013 around Brexit.\n\nSuch episodes are a nightmare for many people, but others yearn for them. Once, these catastrophists were mostly found on the revolutionary left. Now they increasingly come from the right.\n\nDominic Cummings role provokes alarm inside civil service Read more\n\nDuring the long, often politically placid interlude between Thatcherism\u2019s triumph in the 1980s and its undoing by the financial crisis 25 years later, rightwing British newspapers sometimes seemed to be almost willing a national emergency into being. Awful but only temporarily disruptive events, such as the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2001, were often reported in apocalyptic terms. The Daily Telegraph described this as \u201cone of the worst social and financial catastrophes to befall peacetime Britain\u201d. With Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government in office, that assessment by the voice of the Tory shires had a whiff of wishful thinking about it.\n\nFor the British state, national crises are both a curse and an opportunity. Many civil servants want to be consistent administrators or incremental social reformers, not crisis managers, and Whitehall\u2019s routines are disturbed by emergencies. During the three-day week, power cuts meant that staff at the Department of the Environment \u2013 then an ambitious new ministry housed in a glassy, hard-to-heat complex with bare floors \u2013 had to be issued with small squares of carpet to place under their desks to keep their feet warm. More recently, at the Department for Exiting the European Union, so many extra staff have been hastily recruited, a civil servant told me over the summer, that there are not enough toilets. The Brexit metaphor almost writes itself.\n\nYet national emergencies also enable the state to increase its power. In the early 1970s, Edward Heath\u2019s Conservative government secretly established the civil contingencies unit (CCU) \u2013 a typically sly Whitehall euphemism \u2013 to maintain essential amenities and supplies across the country whenever the next big crisis occurred. The CCU combined national and local politicians, civil servants, the military and the police into something approaching a shadow government. Sometimes it seemed to have its own agenda, beyond party politics. During the winter of discontent, when strikes overwhelmed Jim Callaghan\u2019s Labour administration, the CCU\u2019s chairman, an urbane civil servant called Clive Rose, told the transport minister, Bill Rodgers, that its job was not to \u201ckeep the government in office\u201d but \u201cto see the country isn\u2019t destabilised\u201d. A version of the CCU still exists, now known as the civil contingencies secretariat. If a chaotic no-deal Brexit comes, it is not hard to imagine it giving Boris Johnson\u2019s administration similar warnings.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A bread queue in London in 1974: \u2018Edward Heath\u2019s Conservative government secretly established the civil contingencies unit to maintain essential amenities and supplies.\u2019 Photograph: Getty Images\n\nNor is it hard to imagine his government ignoring them. Much is currently being said about how the confrontations and disorder around Brexit fit into a clever plan devised by Dominic Cummings. That may even be the case \u2013 as much as one adviser can influence events. Yet Johnson\u2019s enormously confident, faintly otherworldly strategist could also reflect on the damage done by even fleeting national crises to previous British governments \u2013 even to governments much more competent and popular than his one.\n\nIn 2000, when protests against rising fuel duties blockaded British oil refineries, and petrol stations across the country began to run out of fuel within days, the Blair government \u201cseemed curiously paralysed\u201d, Blair admits in his memoirs. \u201cImages of queues of cars, petrol forecourts crowded or closed, and general chaos\u201d proved \u201cirresistible\u201d to the media. In less than a month, a long-standing Labour\u2019s poll lead over the Tories of about 20% turned into a deficit of almost 10%. Modern voters quickly abandon governments that fail to protect the flow of daily essentials.\n\nBlair swiftly ended the crisis, partly by backing down to the protesters and freezing fuel duties. But the government was sufficiently spooked by the whole experience to pass the Civil Contingencies Act in 2004, an update and expansion of Heath\u2019s emergency powers. The act defined a national crisis in strikingly broad terms, as, among other things, \u201can event or situation which threatens serious damage to human welfare \u2026 the security of the United Kingdom \u2026 [or] disruption of [its] supply of money, food, water, energy or fuel\u201d.\n\nOver recent months, both Theresa May\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s governments have discussed how this Blair-era act could be used to respond to Brexit unrest. In January, the Sunday Times reported that Whitehall was considering \u201ccurfews, bans on travel, confiscation of property\u201d and even \u201cthe introduction of martial law\u201d.\n\nJohnson has already announced his intention to shut parliament in the run-up to Brexit, without any apparent qualms or collapse in Conservative support. The prospect of Britain\u2019s first openly authoritarian Tory election campaign \u2013 one that would be anti-parliamentary, while promising to end the Brexit crisis \u201cby any means necessary\u201d, as Cummings likes to put it \u2013 is no longer just a possibility being considered by paranoid leftists.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Much is being said about how the confrontations and disorder around Brexit all fit into a clever plan devised by Dominic Cummings.\u2019 Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nBut would such a campaign actually work? In 1974, amid the blackouts of the three-day week and a disruptive strike by the then mighty National Union of Mineworkers, Heath called a snap election in order to transform his previously conciliatory premiership into a dominant one. \u201cDo you want a strong government?\u201d he asked in a party political broadcast. The dictatorial hint was brief \u2013 the rest of the broadcast pushed more consensual messages \u2013 but even that was too strong for voters. They chose a compromising Labour government led by Harold Wilson instead.\n\nIn the 70s, as today, more and more Britons began to believe that the country was in a state of general crisis so deep that conventional government couldn\u2019t fix it. And yet it took until the end of the decade, in 1979, for that mood to become strong and widespread enough to carry an authoritarian leader, Margaret Thatcher, into 10 Downing Street. But we live in faster, less politically squeamish times, when populists far to the right of Thatcher are, to many voters and journalists, thrilling political celebrities rather than the sort of people Britain used to fight world wars against. So this time the Conservative party has made its journey from party of consensus to party of crisis in months rather than years.\n\nAnyone who believes that Johnson is the strongman the country needs, however, may wish to recall the last time he was faced with social chaos as a political leader. In the summer of 2011, while he was mayor of London, the capital suffered its worst riots for 30 years. Taken by surprise, Johnson was on holiday in a remote part of Canada. For three days, while the disorder spread across London and other cities, he refused to return. In a BBC interview justifying his absence, he referred to the man whose killing by police sparked the riots, Mark Duggan, as \u201cMichael Duggan\u201d. More of that Johnson carelessness and over-confidence during the fraught years after Brexit could leave Britain with a crisis that makes its previous ones look minor.\n\n\u2022 Andy Beckett is a feature writer for the Guardian", "description": "There are revolutionaries on the political right who crave this kind of upheaval.
