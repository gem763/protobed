(AP) \u2014 Most of the 2,000-plus people who gathered in the Florida heat Tuesday didn\u2019t know Edward Pearson. They knew little, if anything, about the life of the 80-year-old Army veteran.\n\nBut they knew of his death, and that was reason enough to attend his funeral. They came on rumbling Harley Davidsons and in sleek Mercedes. They walked into the service with the aid of canes and service dogs. Women clasped bouquets of white flowers. Men gripped American flags large and small.\n\nPearson, a resident of Naples, Florida, died Aug. 31. His obituary went viral when the funeral director included this sentence in the service announcement: This veteran has no immediate family and all are welcome to attend.\n\nNews of the ceremony at an open-air pavilion area at the Sarasota National Cemetery spread fast and wide in veterans\u2019 forums and on social media networks. CNN host Jake Tapper and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted the information.\n\nFor many in the region - a place with thousands of retirees and veterans - it was impossible to think they wouldn\u2019t attend.\n\n\u201cYou know what? There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to let him do this alone,\u201d said Willie Bowman, 62, a Purple Heart recipient and career Army veteran. \u201cI\u2019ve never met the man. But he\u2019s a veteran and he\u2019s a brother of mine.\u201d\n\nPearson was born in Pennsylvania and moved to Florida 25 years ago. He worked at a grocery store for a bit, and at a hardware store. One woman in the community got to know him after Hurricane Irma in 2017: Patty Thrasher, a customer service representative for the Collier County Tax Collector\u2019s office.\n\nThe storm had damaged the roof of Pearson\u2019s mobile home. Water rained into the kitchen through a blue tarp and when Pearson sought government aid to help with repairs and needed a title, Thrasher discovered that he didn\u2019t actually own the home at all. The man who sold him the home wasn\u2019t actually the owner, but a swindler who took advantage of an elderly person, she said.\n\nWith Thrasher\u2019s help, the community came together to secure a title for the home, fix the roof and pay a past electric bill. Pearson told Thrasher that he didn\u2019t want to \u201cbe on the news\u201d for his plight and was hesitant to ask for help at all. He was preparing to move into a new place when he died.\n\nCemetery officials say it\u2019s not uncommon for veterans to die - and be buried - without family. Volunteer groups, such as the Patriot Guard Riders, regularly attend such services. Some in the crowd on Tuesday said they attend veterans\u2019 funerals at several cemeteries in Florida.\n\nIn Texas, there is a formal effort called the \u201cUnaccompanied Veteran Burial Program\u201d that makes sure veterans in the state receive full military honors.\n\nOn Tuesday, Thrasher said Pearson would have been overwhelmed by the thousands who stood in the heat to send him off.\n\n\u201cI think he would have just totally been in tears,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s looking down and probably crying his heart out.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Most of the 2,000-plus people who gathered in the Florida heat Tuesday didn't know Edward Pearson.
