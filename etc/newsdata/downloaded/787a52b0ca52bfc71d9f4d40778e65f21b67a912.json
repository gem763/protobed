There is no waiting period or National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) check. However, a NICS check must be performed on each individual seeking to buy a semiautomatic rifle at retail and, in some states, that check must be preceded by securing a gun owners\u2019 license or a certificate of gun safety.\n\nMoreover, some states also have waiting periods in place for the purchase of firearms at retail and in some states, such as Washington, an enhanced background check for AR-15 purchases entails an extended waiting period.\n\nYet Watts tweeted:\n\nThis seems like a good time to remind everyone that in America it\u2019s easier to buy a semiautomatic rifle than it is to buy Sudafed. https://t.co/qggVzwzfie \u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) October 7, 2019\n\nThere is a constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Watts did not cite a constitutional right to keep and bear cold medicine.\n\nFive days after the February 14, 2018, Parkland high school shooting, CBS News claimed it was easier to buy an \u201cassault rifle\u201d than anti-diarrhea medicine.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
