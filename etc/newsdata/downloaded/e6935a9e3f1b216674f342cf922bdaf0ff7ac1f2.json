The HBO documentary I Love You, Now Die details the disturbing story of Michelle and Conrad's relationship, and the unprecedented legal case that followed.\n\nAfter Conrad's death in July 2014, Michelle - who was 17 at the time - was found by police to have bombarded the teen with hundreds of text messages urging him to act on his suicidal thoughts.\n\n\"Carbon monoxide poisoning is the best option... if you fall asleep in your car while it's running in a garage, it will kill you,\" Michelle had texted Conrad nine days before his death. Conrad died on 13 July, 2014, locked inside his pickup truck in the car park of a supermarket.\n\nIn June 2017, a judge found Michelle Carter guilty of involuntary manslaughter relating to Conrad Roy's death and she is now serving out her sentence in prison. But a photo taken earlier this year by officials at the Bristol County Police Department, where Michelle has been detained, shows the now-22-year-old looking very different to her trial appearance.\n\nPhoto credit: Uncredited/AP/Shutterstock - Shutterstock More\n\nCarter has had her hair chopped short, and while this may be prison regulation, she's styled it in a way that bizarrely wouldn't look out of place on a celebrity like Kristen Stewart or Cara Delevingne.\n\nThe shot dates back to February 2019, and sees the convict looking forlorn as she gazes down the lens of the camera.\n\nPhoto credit: Boston Globe - Getty Images More\n\nMichelle Carter is currently seven months into her 15-month prison sentence, serving her time at the Bristol County House of Correction adult facility. Speaking after the conviction, Conrad's father, Conrad Roy Jr, shared his relief at the outcome.\n\n\"This has been a very tough time for our family and we'd like to process this verdict that we're happy with,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHBO's I Love You, Now Die is available to watch on the new Sky True Crime channel, or on Now TV from Sunday 6 October.\n\n\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health issues contact a GP or freephone Samaritans for confidential support 24 hours a day, on 116 123.\n\n\n\nFollow Cat on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The 22-year-old is serving a prison a sentence for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide.", "authors": ["Catriona Harvey-Jenner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RIdGzlpOb0OxH4y3BvKvvw--~B/aD03MjQ7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/d1d0bc5e2463b5a0f948724c60496c27", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
