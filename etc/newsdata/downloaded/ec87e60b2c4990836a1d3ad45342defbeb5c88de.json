Workers were going in all directions, some pounding nails into wood, others ready to pour concrete, others driving heavy equipment over piles of dirt.\n\nFor now, it is a construction site. Before long, Inter Miami will call it home.\n\n\"Organised chaos,\" Inter Miami sporting director Paul McDonough said as he took a look around the site of the now-demolished Lockhart Stadium where work on a new complex is happening 12 hours a day, seven days a week. \"But we'll be ready.\"\n\nMore:\n\nThese are hectic times for McDonough and Inter Miami, the team headlined by football icon David Beckham that will embark on its inaugural MLS season starting early in 2020.\n\nThe team does not have a coach yet. Or players. Or a schedule. Or even the first blade of grass for its new pitch.\n\nOver the next few weeks, all those issues - and countless others - will be addressed. Construction is on schedule, with all signs pointing towards everything being ready for the team's first home match that is likely to come in March.\n\nThe construction is continuing at the stadium site for David Beckham's MLS soccer team that will debut in 2020 at the site of the former Lockhart Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida [Tim Reynolds/The Associated Press]\n\nStill, that does not do much to help McDonough's sleep cycle.\n\n\"This takes up a tonne of time and everything keeps me up at night,\" McDonough said. \"But it's OK. We're just on an accelerated timeline. There's so much stuff going on. But this is expansion. It's awesome. Everything we're doing here, we're trying to do it right.\"\n\nAt any given time, there are about 225 workers on the job site - the whereabouts of all of them tracked with an app that gets data from a chip attached to the back of their hard hats. If there is lightning in the area, work gets halted for 30 minutes until the cell passes. And that is a big deal, because even with next season still months away every minute counts.\n\nNothing is ready, yet - but it will be.\n\n\"The way it was built out, we're thinking of the athlete first from the minute they walk in,\" said Jacklyne Ramos, the team's vice president of communications, as she stood inside what will be the building containing the locker room and other key spaces for the team.\n\n\"The main stadium, that's for the games. Where we are now, this is where they'll live.\"\n\nThe Associated Press got a tour on Monday of what will be Inter Miami's inaugural home.\n\nThe shell of the team's headquarters - locker rooms, equipment room, dining area, coach's office, what will become the sports performance lab, the academy workout facilities and more - is coming together.\n\nEvery detail has been thought of; the walk from the players' car park to the building will be short, the training room will be small (\"I don't want them comfortable in there,\" McDonough said), and an area will be built just off the outside wall of the locker room to air out cleats after training sessions.\n\n\"They'll never be in the building,\" McDonough said. \"Boots can stink.\"\n\nBeckham spent about five years trying to get MLS back in South Florida, and after many sites were considered - there are still plans for the team to eventually play in another stadium that Beckham and his partner Jorge Mas want built in Miami - they settled on the former Lockhart site.\n\nLockhart is where the MLS's Miami Fusion played from 1998-2001, eventually folding because of poor attendance.\n\nThe centrepiece of everything is the 18,000-seat stadium, and parts of what will become the field are already largely marked off. Drainage was installed first, followed by four inches of rock for a base.\n\nFrom there, sprinklers will be installed and four thin pieces of wood are set in place to mark where the goalposts will go. About a foot of soil will be added in the coming weeks, watered and compacted and graded.\n\nSod is scheduled to go in November 14; it will be protected and fenced off and finally, what now seems like an oversized sandpit will look like a place to play football.\n\nBehind that are more fields, including a turf one that can be used for high school football and other events. The other half-dozen grass fields will be for training and the team's affiliate clubs.\n\nA coach will be hired soon. A roster is coming. There are plans for a soft opening a few weeks before the season and then, when the first match is played all the mess and chaos will be forgotten.\n\n\"I wasn't ready for this. I'm still not,\" McDonough said. \"I'm learning as we go. Conduits, positioning of poles, there's so many things that you don't realise until you live it. But that's what it takes and we're getting it done.\"", "description": "Construction is on schedule for getting the site ready for the team's first home match in March.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/22/29ee9080ac7646d3ad368329b487ba16_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
