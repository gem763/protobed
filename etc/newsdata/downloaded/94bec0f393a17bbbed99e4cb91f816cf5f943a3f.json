School! Not day care, school. We bring social workers into homes of parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It's not that they don't want to help. They don't know what \u2014 they don't know what quite what to do,\" Biden said.\n\n\"Play the radio. Make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night. The phone\u2014make sure the kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school \u2014 er, a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there,\" he added.\n\nRead more: 'Have the record player on at night': Joe Biden's animated response to a Democratic debate question about segregation was a head-scratcher\n\nAs NPR reported in 2018, Biden's claim that poor kids hear fewer words spoken than kids from wealthy households comes from a 2017 study where researchers placed recording devices in 329 homes and found that by the age of 3, kids from low-income households heard 4 million fewer words than wealthy kids.\n\nWhile Biden's outdated reference to record players prompted lots of jokes, many commentators raised serious concerns about Biden taking a question about the legacy of slavery, and making it about inadequate parenting by individual families.\n\nTime magazine editor and author Anand Giridharadas, in particular, argued that instead of addressing institutional racism, Biden's comments perpetuated an inaccurate and racist narrative that all African-Americans are poor, and poor people of color are unfit to parent without intervention.\n\nAnd as others pointed out, Biden's insinuating that some black families don't listen to enough music is fundamentally ahistorical given the rich history and tradition of black music in America, which dates back to the era of slavery.\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC's Hallie Jackson, Biden's communications director Kate Bedingfield did not directly address Giridharadas' criticisms about the racial implications of the comments, and said she did not believe that Biden should have answered the question differently.\n\n\"[Biden] made the same point he makes all the time about the investment in underserved communities and his record of investing in underserved communities ... the point that he was making was an incredibly important one, which is about exposure to language and making sure kids have the resources and opportunities to learn,\" she said.\n\nFormer HUD Secretary Julian Castro (right), took several shots at Joe Biden (left) in the September 12 Democratic debate Screenshot via ABC News\n\nSome accused the media of showing bias by glossing over the substance of Biden's comments\n\nReducing inequality in childhood education and improving child development outcomes is certainly a laudable goal. But commentators argued that placing the blame on black parents to address the legacy of slavery was a troubling indicator of his inability to engage on the real issue.\n\nStephen Nu\u00f1o-P\u00e9rez, an associate professor and chair in the department of politics and international affairs at Northern Arizona University, told Insider that \"the Democrats keep saying 'this is the most important election in our lifetime' and then continually protect someone who continues to say wrong things.\"\n\nNu\u00f1o-P\u00e9rez also said that the media \u2014 particularly cable news \u2014 showed hypocrisy and bias in being far more critical of former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro's attacks on Biden than the former vice president's meandering response on how to deal with racial inequality in schools.\n\n\"The media was more aghast at what Castro said, despite being right, than what Biden had said to answer a question about segregation ... [Biden] essentially said we need social workers because black people can't take care of their kids and we need to play records,\" Nu\u00f1o-P\u00e9rez said. \"That was the answer? It made no sense!\"\n\nRead more: Juli\u00e1n Castro was defiantly combative at the Democratic debate, and it paid off\n\nNu\u00f1o-P\u00e9rez said many in the media seemed more interested in scolding a \"young brown guy\" who disrespected someone they \"revere\" than offering balanced coverage of the debate.\n\n\"The media could really just care less about the base of the Democratic party. The people who are going to put you over the top in this election are black people, white progressives, and Latinos,\" he added. \"Two out of three of those people the media could really care less about \u2014 and that needs to be pointed out.\"\n\nEchoing these sentiments, Preston Mitchum, an activist and adjunct law professor at Georgetown Law Center, told Insider that the general reaction to Castro versus Biden is emblematic of a \"mainstream media that is hellbent on protecting\" who it believes should ascend to the presidency.\n\n\"Any candidate who goes against that grain, who goes against the status quo, will often be persecuted by the media,\" he said.", "description": "Commentators raised serious concerns about Biden taking a question about the legacy of slavery and making it about inadequate parenting.", "authors": ["Grace Panetta", "John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7b09c62e22af21f533b614-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
