I was reading about your opponent the other day. He sounds like a real piece of \u2026\u201d Here, she remembers that TIME is tagging along. \u201cWork,\u201d she finishes.\n\nCalls like this consume a lot of Post\u2019s time these days. The 39-year-old president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) is leading an unheralded but critically important campaign to win back state offices for the party after eight years of deep losses during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. The consequences go far beyond which states may be prevented from joining lawsuits trying to dismantle Obamacare or restrict abortion rights. The candidates who win state legislative races later this year and in 2020 will decide who wields power in Washington for a decade.\n\nEvery 10 years, politics rewrites itself, starting with the decennial Census. Legislatures in 31 states use the findings to draw the borders of federal congressional districts. In some, nonpartisan commissions draw the lines clinically. In others, it comes down to who has the Sharpie and the least amount of shame. The map is due to be reset before the 2022 midterm elections, which means lawmakers elected as soon as this year may determine where the congressional battlegrounds will be into the 2030s. \u201cState legislatures are the building blocks of our democracy,\u201d Post tells TIME during a break from candidate calls in the DLCC office five blocks from the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s a level of the ballot that\u2019s been forgotten. But state legislators draw the lines, so control of Congress in many ways is decided by rules put together in state legislatures.\u201d\n\nFor decades, Democrats have largely overlooked these local offices to their detriment. Terry McAuliffe, a former Virginia governor, remembers arriving at Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters to start his job as party chairman in February 2001 and making a troubling discovery: lawmakers in the states were starting to draw new district maps, and no one at the DNC was paying attention.\n\n\u201cNot a thing had been done on redistricting,\u201d McAuliffe recalls. \u201cIn the past, I don\u2019t think our party understood the importance of legislative chambers.\u201d\n\nThey soon learned. In 2010, the Tea Party wave washed 681 Democrats out of legislative seats right before new battle lines could be drawn, according to data tracked by the National Conference of State Legislatures, giving the GOP the opportunity to cement its advantage in competitive congressional districts. In all, Democrats lost 958 state legislative seats during Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nPost, a meticulous Missouri native who previously held top roles at Emily\u2019s List and the DLCC, rejoined the group in 2016 with a mandate to reverse the slide. Since then, Democrats have flipped 283 state legislature seats, with a net gain of six chambers. Post has tripled the organization\u2019s staff and quintupled its fundraising target from $10 million to an estimated $50 million for the 2020 cycle.\n\nOther Democratic groups have begun investing in down-ballot contests too. In August, Emily\u2019s List announced a $20 million effort to help flip legislatures. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, with the backing of Obama and the help of McAuliffe, has started a group called the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which is dedicated to the process of drawing new borders. Flippable, a grassroots Democratic group focused on winning statehouse races, has already funneled $125,000 into Virginia and is eyeing eight other states in 2020.\n\nBut Democrats are aware they\u2019re still playing catch-up in a space the party has long neglected. \u201cRepublicans have been doing this for decades,\u201d says Amanda Litman, the executive director of Run for Something, a group that recruits young progressives to stand in down-ballot elections. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have Democratic control of state legislatures ahead of redistricting in 2021, Republicans will take back Congress in 2022, and that\u2019s the end of functioning government in Washington.\u201d\n\nPost, center, with DLCC press secretary Matt Harringer, right, and Erik Darcey, campaign manager for Virginia house of delegates candidate Dan Helmer Greg Kahn for TIME\n\nOn a recent Saturday afternoon, Post huddled with Virginia\u2019s Democratic brain trust on the 20th floor of an office building in downtown Richmond, Va. The group gathered around a conference table, clicking through a slideshow of district maps, media budgets and historical vote tallies. Post spends a lot of time on the state these days. Virginia, New Jersey, Mississippi and Louisiana hold the only statewide legislative elections in 2019, and Post is using the commonwealth to test her assumptions, technology, vendors and data, shelling out $1 million and counting in the process. The conference room looks down on the capitol, where the DLCC needs to flip two seats for Democrats to claim the majority in the state\u2019s house of delegates and two more to do the same in the senate. Doing both would give the party the trifecta\u2013control of both legislative chambers and the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nPost asks for a briefing on what house strategists have gleaned from the first six focus groups they\u2019ve organized in Virginia. She wants to know how many Republican-held districts they\u2019re targeting where Democrat Ralph Northam won his race for governor in 2017, and how many Tim Kaine won when he ran for U.S. Senate in 2018. (The answer is nine and 12.) How many districts, she asks, are Democrats leaving uncontested?\n\nThe answer is not many. Democrats have built a machine in Virginia, seeded in part with cash Post started sending southward as early as December 2018. There are 91 Democratic candidates for the commonwealth\u2019s 100 house races on Nov. 5, and 35 senate hopefuls for the chamber\u2019s 40 spots, which include three senate districts that voted for Hillary Clinton for President in 2016 but are currently represented by Republicans. \u201cThey are running to build the party,\u201d house caucus executive director Trevor Southerland says.\n\nThe DLCC\u2019s play has indirect effects too. For instance, the group has featured one of its favorite candidates, activist Sheila Bynum-Coleman, in national fundraising messages; 21% of her donations have come from out-of-state donors as a result. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have gotten the attention if it weren\u2019t for the DLCC,\u201d says Bynum-Coleman, who is challenging the current speaker of the house of delegates in a Richmond-area district.\n\nAt the conference table, Post keeps asking questions about the blend of TV and digital advertising in specific races. \u201cThat\u2019s an expensive district,\u201d says Kristina Hagen, executive director of the Virginia Senate Democratic Caucus, of one seat in the Washington media market. \u201cThere is a world in which we can get away with digital and cable.\u201d\n\nPost still urges them to book TV early. \u201cReserve aggressively,\u201d she says.\u201dWe have to win this.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats can afford pricey TV ads because they\u2019ve been chipping away at the GOP\u2019s longtime financial advantage in the states. The three major Democratic committees in Virginia have already spent $2 million, compared with just a quarter of that invested by their GOP counterparts. (Virginia\u2019s GOP house speaker Kirk Cox, Bynum-Coleman\u2019s opponent, has added about $500,000 through his PAC to help his Republican colleagues.) \u201cI\u2019d think Democrats should be disappointed if they don\u2019t flip both chambers,\u201d says Kyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. \u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a slam dunk that they will in fact flip them both.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see how Post convinces donors that these low-profile races are worthy investments in the Trump era. Republicans \u201cwon and rigged the maps,\u201d Post says. \u201cThey re-engineered everything and put in place durable majorities.\u201d Now she wants Democrats to have control when it comes time to define the next 10 years.\n\nPost\u2019s counterpart at the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC), Austin Chambers, is working hard to prevent that. Chambers says his group will raise more money than ever, and plans to top the $40 million it spent in the 2015\u20132016 election cycle. In August, the RSLC announced that former Republican National Committee finance chairman Ron Weiser, a fundraising legend, was joining the group. \u201cThey should be optimistic. Because when you\u2019re at rock bottom, the only place you have to go is up,\u201d Chambers says of the Democrats. \u201cWe\u2019re glad they finally discovered this thing called state legislators.\u201d\n\nBut Chambers has been warning donors that Post\u2019s efforts cannot be written off, lest Republicans suffer the way their opponents have at the state level. \u201cWhat happens in a few state legislative races over the next year and a half will determine the balance of Congress for at least the next decade or longer,\u201d Chambers says. \u201cThe importance of this cannot be overstated. It\u2019s as serious as anything we\u2019ve ever faced.\u201d\n\nThe path toward Republican dominance at the state level began more than three decades ago, when Democrats, in the wake of Jimmy Carter\u2019s loss to Ronald Reagan in 1980, focused their energy on presidential politics in the 1984 cycle. The current dynamic dates back to 2010, when Karl Rove wrote a Wall Street Journal column laying the groundwork for what came to be called the Redistricting Majority Project (REDMAP). The RSLC\u2019s REDMAP program recruited and funded state-level candidates aggressively. REDMAP spent $30 million to the DLCC\u2019s $8 million that year. The effort netted GOP total control of 11 legislatures and a trifecta in nine additional states. In turn, the party started drawing congressional districts it liked.\n\nRepublicans still start with a leg up in the battle for the states in 2020. The GOP controls 52% of seats in all state legislatures, with majorities in 62% of state legislative chambers and total control of state government in 22 states, to Democrats\u2019 14. But many of the chambers have narrow GOP edges. Democrats stand to pick up majorities in seven chambers\u2013including those in Minnesota, Arizona and Virginia\u2013if they can win 19 specific races.\n\nMeanwhile, the gains Democrats have made in recent years may be difficult to defend. President Donald Trump was a liability for Republicans in 2018, when he wasn\u2019t on the ballot and his approval sat at 40% in Gallup\u2019s final pre-election survey. But Trump could wind up helping GOP candidates in 2020, when the party hopes his massive political machine will boost fortunes of candidates all the way down the ballot.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that existing Democratic-led statehouses overstep their mandates and provoke a backlash. In typically blue Illinois, for example, lawmakers declared abortion a fundamental right, no matter what the Supreme Court may say. When Republicans in the Colorado statehouse objected to the pace of change under Democratic control, they raised procedural hurdles and demanded the measures be read aloud. Democrats responded by having five computers read a 2,023-page bill simultaneously\u2013so quickly the text was unintelligible. The issue went to court, where the Republicans won.\n\nThe party that wins control of Richmond in November and other state capitals in 2020 has decisions to make. Republicans may want to cluster African-American voters into one district to make the rest of the area easier to win. Democrats may want to spread those voters out more evenly. In Northern Virginia, both parties may want to minimize the number of seats that have to buy ad time in the expensive D.C. market. Armed with enough data, it\u2019s possible to draw lines that enhance the odds of winning again and again. \u201cWe were so pleased as Democrats that we won this Congress,\u201d Post says of the 2018 elections. \u201cBut the truth is, it\u2019s just a rental.\u201d\n\nAll this is on Post\u2019s mind as the car inches through the traffic toward the Washington suburbs. She\u2019s back on the phone, checking in with a different Virginia candidate. \u201cThank you for putting your name on the ballot,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the bravest thing you can do.\u201d\n\nWrite to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com.\n\nThis appears in the September 16, 2019 issue of TIME.", "description": "The candidates who win state legislative races later this year and in 2020 will decide who wields power in Washington for a decade.", "authors": ["Philip Elliott"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/social-battleground-states.jpg?quality=85", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
