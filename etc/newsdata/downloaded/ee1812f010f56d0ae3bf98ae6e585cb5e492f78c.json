They are still a little bit \u2018old Arsenal\u2019 but you can see the difference now.\n\nJust look at the performance in the 2-0 win against Chelsea in the Premier League last Saturday.\n\nArsenal have a top coach in Unai Emery but he must be given four or five transfer windows\n\nHaving said that, Emery needs four or five transfer windows to get things right.\n\nIt does not surprise me that Mesut Ozil and Aaron Ramsey are on the way out. Emery wants players that can transform the club so he has to be able to ship players out, to be able to correct things.\n\nIt is like a cultural shift, a big mentality shift. But he needs to do that and needs time.\n\nHe is a massively talented coach, spoken of so highly in Spain.\n\nValencia had 15 managers in 13 years but he was there for four years. They still talk about how good he was. He is a top coach and Arsenal have to support him.\n\nIt is almost 20 years since United beat Arsenal 2-1 in the semi-final replay in 1999. It was the best game of football I have ever played in.\n\nIt was the only time in a football match where I ever smiled, because it was so enjoyable and exciting.\n\nPeter Schmeichel had done his thigh so I was taking the goal-kicks. I walked towards the fans to take one and just smiled thinking: \u2018This is unbelievable.\u2019\n\nI always remember after the game we were being carried off the pitch but Tony Adams and Lee Dixon were standing outside our changing room to shake our hands.\n\nI remember thinking: \u2018Bloody hell, they are proper guys these two.\u2019\n\nMesut Ozil and Aaron Ramsey are on the way out as Emery looks to transform the club", "description": "GARY NEVILLE: This will be a good game because Manchester United will go for it \u2014 and so will Arsenal.
