Here's why that's important", "language": "en", "text": "(CNN) New research finds there are significant differences between babies born by cesarean and babies born vaginally when it comes to a newborn's microbiome -- the bacteria that colonize our gut and play a key role in keeping us healthy.\n\nIn the largest study of its kind, researchers found that vaginally born babies got most of their gut bacteria from their mother, while babies born via cesarean did not. Instead, they had more bacteria associated with hospitals in their guts. However, these difference had disappeared by the time the babies were weaned.\n\n\"We think it's a critical moment in life. Babies are sterile in the womb and the moment they are born is a moment when the immune system has a huge number of bacteria it's presented with. The hypothesis is that that moment of birth is a thermostatic moment that sets the immune system for future life,\" said Dr. Nigel Field, a clinical associate professor at University College London, a senior author of the study that published in the journal Nature on Wednesday.\n\nHe said during a press conference that the more common bacteria found in C-section babies were called \"opportunistic pathogens,\" which can be carried by healthy people without causing any problem but \"can cause disease when the immune system isn't working properly or they get somewhere they shouldn't, such as tissues or the blood stream.\n\n\"These difference largely even out over time, so by the time babies have weaned, about six to nine months, these differences have largely disappeared.\n\nRead More", "description": "There are significant differences between babies born by cesarean and babies born vaginally when it comes to a newborn's microbiome, the bacteria that colonize our gut and play a key role in keeping us healthy, new research has found.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171108105918-baby-feet-stock-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
