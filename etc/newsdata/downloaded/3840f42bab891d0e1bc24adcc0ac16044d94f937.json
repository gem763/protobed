It\u2019s even something you\u2019ll be able to do if your money is managed by investment giant Charles Schwab, which said last week that it would introduce fractional share trading to help attract younger customers.\n\nNow anyone can buy $42 or even $1 worth of Berkshire Hathaway A ($BRK.A, or $TSLA or $SFIX or\u2026) instantly and for free right in @CashApp. Really proud of the team for making buying stocks and building wealth accessible to more people.

Cash App does have one leg up on Robinhood, though \u2014 Robinhood doesn\u2019t support fractional share trading yet.\n\nStock trading was first rumored to come to the Cash App earlier this year. Investing isn\u2019t entirely new to Cash App, as you can use the app to buy Bitcoin already, but this will be on a much larger scale, as there will be many more potential investments to choose from. With the addition of stock trading, Cash App becomes that much more useful as an all-in-one money manager for moving money between peers, investments, and your bank.\n\nInvesting on Cash App should be rolling out to all customers in the coming weeks, according to a Square spokesperson.", "description": "Square announced that you\u2019ll soon be able to invest in stocks using its Cash App, and says you\u2019ll be able start investing with $1.
