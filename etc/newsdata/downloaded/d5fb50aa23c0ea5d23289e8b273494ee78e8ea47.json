Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg's arrival ignites exploitation debate", "url": "https://washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/29/greta-thunberg-teen-climate-activist-sails-us-igni", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-08-29", "downloaded_at": "2019-09-02 07:25:27.513262+00:00", "text": "She\u2019s the biggest climate celebrity since Al Gore, but Sweden\u2019s Greta Thunberg made her triumphant arrival in New York City for a month of activism amid rising concerns over whether the pig-tailed teen is a global-warming prophet or a political pawn.\n\nGreta received a hero\u2019s welcome Wednesday after she and her entourage sailed into lower Manhattan on a 60-foot zero-carbon yacht, opting to sail the Atlantic for two weeks rather than fly to avoid contributing to carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cIt is insane that a 16-year-old would have to cross the Atlantic Ocean to make a stand,\u201d she told the cheering crowd that greeted her at the marina. \u201cThe climate and ecological crisis is a global crisis, the biggest crisis that humanity has ever faced.\u201d\n\nCritics beg to differ, saying what\u2019s insane is the specter of world leaders and media outlets venerating a vulnerable 16-year-old girl \u2014 she has Asperger\u2019s syndrome and a history of mental-health issues \u2014 whose contribution to the climate debate has been to encourage kids to ditch school until they get their way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad she had a safe journey across the Atlantic, but I feel sorry for her,\u201d said Jim Lakely, spokesman for the free-market Heartland Institute. \u201cGreta is being exploited by the adults around her to push the climate delusion while they use her as a human shield to shame anyone who criticizes the alarmist agenda.\u201d\n\nGrove City College professor Mark W. Hendrickson said adults are using Greta \u201cas a puppet and a mouthpiece to advance their own agenda,\u201d while Breitbart London\u2019s James Delingpole called her \u201ca brainwashed child in pig-tails pushing a hard-left, anti-capitalist agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll you need to know about Greta Thunberg, the 16 year old autistic child from Sweden, is that the left expects you to listen to her, comply with her, and never question her,\u201d said the Resurgent\u2019s Erick Erickson in a Thursday post. \u201cShe is the newly appointed high priestess of climate change.\u201d\n\nOne reason for the attention is her compelling backstory. She first learned of climate change at school when she was 8. Three years later, she became depressed, stopped talking and stopped eating. She was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s, obsessive-compulsive disorder and selective mutism.\n\nShe landed on the media\u2019s radar almost exactly one year ago when she began skipping school to sit in front of the Swedish parliament with a homemade \u201cSchool Strike for Climate\u201d sign. The activist group We Don\u2019t Have Time promoted her strike, and shortly thereafter Fridays for Future was born.\n\nSoon thousands of students across Europe, Australia and Japan were participating in school climate strikes every Friday, with Greta egging them on, saying school was pointless under the circumstances.\n\n\u201cWhy should we be studying for a future that soon will be no more when no one is doing anything whatsoever to save that future?\u201d she told a crowd at an October rally.\n\nIn November, she did a TED Talk in Stockholm. In January, she scolded billionaires at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. In March, she was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, and in April, she met with Pope Francis, who encouraged her to keep up the fight.\n\n\u2018Saint Greta\u2019\n\nHer meteoric rise comes with the climate movement increasingly showcasing its youthful activists \u2014 see the Sunrise Movement \u2014 who draw cameras like iron to magnets. It doesn\u2019t hurt that Greta, with her rosy cheeks, simple braids and no makeup, looks younger than her 16 years.\n\nShe has received credit for her direct, forthright speaking style \u2014 Parkland student Emma Gonzalez praised her for \u201cinspiring steadfast students and shaming apathetic adults\u201d \u2014 but clearly Greta has also received an assist from the adults in her life.\n\nHer parents have insisted in interviews that their daughter is the driving force, but both are celebrities themselves: Her father Svante Thunberg is an actor and author, and her mother, Malena Ernman, is a prominent opera singer whose book about the family, \u201cScenes from the Heart,\u201d was released in Sweden in August 2018, the same month Greta\u2019s school strike began.\n\nBenny Peiser, president of the skeptical Global Warming Policy Foundation in London, said Greta\u2019s mental-health struggles illustrate the dangers of whipping up kids into a climate frenzy.\n\n\u201cThe tragedy of Greta is that she has been encouraged into a state of extreme anxiety by irresponsible adults,\u201d Mr. Peiser said in an email. \u201cShe has been used as a vessel for their extremist politics yet expect her to take the flack. This kind of quasi hysterical behaviour is typical of apocalyptic doomsday cults.\u201d\n\nFrench politicians on the right balked last month when Greta was invited to speak before the parliament, with MP Julien Aubert describing her as \u201cSaint Greta Thunberg, surrounded by people who see global warming as a religion,\u201d according to Le Figaro.\n\nAfter she spoke to British lawmakers in April, the [U.K.] Sun called her \u201cbright, engaged, passionate about her cause and inspiring to other kids,\u201d but took issue with \u201cthe credulous adults fawning over her.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Greta\u2019s black-and-white view, climate change is frying the planet while wicked corporations cash in and lazy governments \u2018don\u2019t listen to the science,\u2019 \u201d said the Sun. \u201cIt\u2019s simplistic nonsense. Governments try to balance tough environmental action with keeping people in jobs and families fed.\u201d\n\nNone of that has diminished her star power, which had already begun to cross the pond even before she sailed into the Big Apple. Time Magazine named her one of the \u201c2019 Time 100\u201d and featured her on the cover in May. She met previously with President Barack Obama and, yes, Mr. Gore.\n\nYes we can, Greta. I\u2019m hopeful because of you and all the young people who are fighting to protect the planet. Keep at it. https://t.co/sUBwC0uNW8 \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) June 16, 2019\n\n\n\nFirst on the agenda: She\u2019s bringing her School Strike for Climate movement to New York City, headlining a press conference Friday with Extinction Rebellion and other groups across to encourage students to take part in the Sept. 20 Global Climate Strike.\n\nHer U.S. trip is expected to culminate Sept. 23 with a speech at the U.N. Climate Action Summit. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed her Wednesday to New York, tweeting that the \u201cdetermination and perseverance shown during your journey should embolden all of us.\u201d\n\nReporters wasted no time asking her about President Trump, and she didn\u2019t hold back.\n\n\u201cEveryone always asks me about Donald Trump, but my message for him is just listen to the science, and he obviously doesn\u2019t do that,\u201d she said. \u201cAs I always say to this question, if no one has been able to convince him about the climate crisis, the urgency, then why should I be able to do that?\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cSo I\u2019m going to focus on spreading awareness.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
