He modeled his music business on an auto assembly line.\n\n\u201cCompetition breeds champions.\u201d Was that said by 18th century economic philosopher Adam Smith? 20th century economist Milton Friedman? Neither. It was Berry Gordy, a former boxer and auto assembly line worker turned film producer, author, songwriter, television producer, and founder of Motown Records.\n\nGordy announced his retirement a month ago during Motown\u2019s 60th anniversary celebration in Detroit. This year\u2019s festivities have also included groundbreaking on a major expansion of the Motown Museum, the Showtime documentary \u201cHitsville: The Making of Motown,\u201d and a night of Motown films Oct. 22 on Turner Classic Movies.\n\nMillions of us who grew up listening to The Supremes, the Four Tops, The Temptations, The Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Smokey Robinson and the Miracles remember Motown for the best music we\u2019d heard before or since. Some have come to believe, as Jimi Hendrix said, \u201cMusic doesn\u2019t lie. If there is something to be changed in this world, then it can only happen through music.\u201d\n\nMotown music helped heal a nation\n\nIn the 1960s, something needed to change. Race problems resulted in riots like Bloody Sunday in 1965, when 600 peaceful demonstrators were beaten and teargassed by Alabama police for protesting the killing of a black civil rights activist. But at the same time, kids of every color were dancing to Motown hits like \u201cStop! In the Name of Love\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s the Same Old Song.\u201d\n\nI could never sit when the Four Tops played \u201cReach Out.\u201d It felt like my song. Gordy \u2014affectionately known as B.G. \u2014 understood Motown\u2019s appeal, saying \u201cit\u2019s not really black music. It\u2019s music by black stars.\u201d\n\nBerry Gordy in New York in 2017.

At Motown concerts, the ropes that divided black and white kids came down and everyone danced together.\n\nMusical heritage: Teaching the blues to Mississippi Delta kids shows them they have a culture to be proud of\n\nMotown\u2019s music and message were bolstered by Gordy\u2019s business acumen. He created a friendly competition among singing groups and, as Motown artist Valerie Simpson said, \u201cIt made you sharpen your tools \u2026 to come up with something that would stand apart.\" Another motto Berry impressed on Motown writers, choreographers and singers was \u201cInnovate or stagnate.\u201d He was certainly an innovator. Before starting Motown in April 1960, Gordy had worked on the Lincoln-Mercury assembly line in Detroit. He set out to apply that production method to the seemingly unrelated music business.\n\nCreating greatness amid poverty\n\nIn some ways, Gordy\u2019s motivation was just like most people\u2019s. One of the first songs he co-wrote was \u201cMoney, (That\u2019s What I Want),\u201d and, as he once put it, \u201cI can make a lot more money if I sell it to white people, too.\u201d\n\nI visited Hitsville U.S.A., Motown's first headquarters, a few years ago and hung around for a few hours. I was struck by what I saw. Nine out of 10 visitors looked like me, older and white. They also had that same dreamlike look on their faces as they recalled the wonderful music of their youth and realized it was all made in this small house on West Grand Boulevard.\n\nGordy created so many great musicians, often from very poor districts in Detroit. His friend Smokey Robinson reflected on this and said that while every place on Earth has the same amount of talent, \u201cthey just don\u2019t have a Berry Gordy.\u201d Smokey was also right when he said, \u201cMotown is a great example of the American Dream.\u201d\n\nMichigan vs. Maryland: Why Trump won't give cities like Detroit the Baltimore treatment\n\nIn his 1776 book, \u201cThe Wealth of Nations,\u201d Adam Smith wrote, \u201cIt is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.\u201d Berry put it more simply: \u201cWhen I started, all I wanted to do was make some music, make some money, and meet some girls.\u201d\n\nHe did all of that, but he also did what Motown artist Marvin Gaye sang about in one of the most beautiful songs ever recorded, \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On.\u201d Berry found a way \u201cto bring some lovin\u2019 here today.\u201d\n\nRichard Williams is a senior affiliated scholar with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
