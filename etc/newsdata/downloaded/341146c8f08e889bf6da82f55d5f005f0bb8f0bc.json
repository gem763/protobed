More than 8 in 10 Democrats endorse the impeachment proceedings.\n\nBut 57 per cent of independents, the largest bloc in this poll, support impeachment. The poll has a margin of error of 3.5 per cent.\n\nRepublican support for impeachment proceedings in on the rise, with nearly one in three claiming they support the inquiry against Donald Trump\n\nOverall support for the impeachment inquiry spiked after September reports revealed Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate his political rival. Now 58 per cent of Americans support Pelosi's decision to launch the impeachment proceedings\n\nThe survey was conducted October 1-6, in the days following revelations that Trump engaged in a phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart urging him to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter \u2013 a move which ultimately led to Pelosi launching a formal inquiry.\n\nThe revelation appears to have prompted Americans to change their minds about their position on impeachment, and results among registered voters are almost exactly the same as those results among all Americans.\n\nThe poll indicates that 58 per cent of Americans believe that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was right to launch an impeachment inquiry, compared to the 38 per cent who say they oppose the measure.\n\nIn March , the same poll indicated Americans opposed the start to impeachment proceedings by a margin of 41 perc ent to 54 per cent.\n\nNow, of the 58 per cent who say they support the inquiry, 49 per cent say the House should take it a step further and vote to remove Trump from office to the merre 6 per cent who feel otherwise.\n\nSupport for impeachment has been on the rise since July, but spiked recently after revelations of the Ukrainian scandal continued to unravel.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced toward the end of September that the lower chamber of Congress was launching an impeachment proceeding, and 58 per cent of Americans now say they support her decision\n\nToward the end of September, an anonymous whistle-blower went public with a complaint he filed in August related to a call Trump held with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25.\n\nDuring the call, which Trump released a transcript of, the president pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden's business dealings in the country. Trump claimed it was potential corruption considering Hunter took the board position with a Ukrainian natural gas firm was his father was still vice president.\n\nPelosi, who was hesitant to utter the I-word, quickly changed her tune after learning the details of the call and announced the House was launching an impeachment inquiry into the president \u2013 only the fourth ever in U.S. history.\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing ever since the existence of the whistle-blower's complaint became public. He has called his conversation with Zelensky 'perfect.'\n\nA separate poll, conducted by the National Republican Congressional Committee and Team McCarthy by Public Opinion Strategies, shows a completely different story than the other polls.\n\nIn that survey, only 37 per cent of voters said they felt Trump's call with Zelesnky warranted impeachment, and 59 per cent said it was an appropriate conversation.\n\nHowever, in districts Trump won that are represented by Democrats, 62 per cent in this poll say the call was OK, while 33 per cent say it's an impeachable offense.\n\nCritics have also noted an interesting question the polls asked its respondents.\n\n'Now, I'd like to read you a few statements regarding this matter, and please tell me whether you agree or disagree with each one,' the pollsters prompted of participants. 'If Democrats are going to proceed, they should set a date certain to end the inquiry so it does not further politicize next year's election.'\n\nSixty-five percent of voters said they agreed with this statement and 31 per cent disagreed.", "description": "Public opinion of impeachment, from Democrats and Republicans alike, has quickly shifted, with the majority of Americans saying they support the proceedings.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/18/19453476-0-image-a-65_1570555940730.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
