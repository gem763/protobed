If rhetoric escalates, probably see a move through 6.00/USD \u201cpretty quickly.\u201d\n\nThe lira may face further downside from the risk of of sanctions tied to Russian military equipment tied to sanctions linked to Syria, McKenna said.\n\nA White House statement late Sunday said the U.S. wouldn\u2019t stand in the way of an attack American-backed Kurdish forces in northern Syria, and had fueled speculation that a face-off between the allies could be averted.\n\nInvestors have been bracing for a Turkish occupation of a strip of northern Syria for months, but the risk of another flare-up between the estranged NATO allies risks derailing the recovery in the lira. A diplomatic fallout between Washington and Ankara last year triggered a currency crisis that dragged the nation into its first recession in a decade.\n\n(Updates with lira move in second paragraph, strategist comments in third-fifth paragraphs)", "description": "Lira Slumps as Trump Warns Turkey Over Military Operation", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picaa26578d139ae60e0349f7efef181e6f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
