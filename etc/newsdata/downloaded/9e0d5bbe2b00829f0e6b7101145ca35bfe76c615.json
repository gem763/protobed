However, senior Chinese officials have recently signaled reluctance to work toward President Donald Trump\u2019s broad trade deal, according to Bloomberg News. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is expected to lead the Chinese trade delegation in Washington this week, and he is reportedly planning to take one of Trump\u2019s key demands off of the table. According to reports, Liu plans to bring a trade offer to the U.S. that excludes commitments on reforming Chinese industrial policy or government subsidies.\n\nThough the Trump administration has vehemently denied claims that the impeachment inquiry into the president has affected the trade negotiations, many speculate that the drama in Washington has given the Chinese an upper hand in the trade war.\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz More\n\nAs recent economic data pointed to a weakening economy, investors will be paying close attention to the trade developments and the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) September meeting minutes. Market participants will be looking for further clues on the Fed\u2019s monetary policy path. Fed Chair Jay Powell is scheduled to speak on two separate occasions this week. On Tuesday, Powell will be in Denver, Colorado at the The 61st National Association for Business Economics (NABE) Annual Meeting. He will be discussing \u201cData Dependence in an Evolving Economy.\u201d Wednesday, Powell will be at the Fed Listens: A Community Listening Session in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nFollowing the worrisome manufacturing data and weaker-than-expected jobs report last week, many economists are anticipating that the Fed will cut rates at its meeting at the end of this month and possibly one more time in December. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren told Yahoo Finance that he thinks the Fed is pretty close to fulfilling its dual mandate on inflation and unemployment, and thus does not necessarily see a case for a rate cut at this time. Rosengren previously dissented both of the Fed\u2019s decision to cut rates earlier this year.\n\n[Read more: Boston Fed's Rosengren: US economy 'consistent with staying where we are']\n\nSTOCKS: General Electric freezes pension plan for employees; General Motors strike enters fourth week\n\nGeneral Electric (GE) shares rose Monday after the industrial giant said it would freeze pension plans for about 20,000 employees in a cost-cutting measure. GE has been sitting on a massive debt pile, and the move to freeze pensions will reduce the company\u2019s pension deficit by about $5 billion to $8 billion. The embattled company also plans to freeze supplementary pension benefits for about 700 executives. The freeze will go into effect January 1, 2021. GE shares have been struggling over the past several years. The stock has fallen 29% in the past year and 62% in the past two years.\n\nTalks between General Motors (GM) and the United Auto Worker\u2019s Union (UAW) took a turn for the worse over the weekend, according to Terry Dittes, UAW Vice President in charge of the GM department. The UAW made an offer to GM on Saturday that covered wages, signing bonuses, job security and profit sharing. GM provided a counteroffer, which the UAW turned down. Since the strike began on September 16, analysts estimate that it has cost GM about $1 billion. The two sides have been meeting daily to reach an agreement. Though the strike did not affect September\u2019s payroll figures, economists have noted that the strike most likely negatively affected the manufacturing data released last week.\n\nYahoo Finance All Markets Summit More\n\n\u2014\n\nHeidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
