So they rock, paper, scissored over who was going to run that route.\"\n\nIronically, Michael Casagrande of AL.com noted neither Jeudy nor Smith caught the ball on the ensuing play, which was a 25-yard completion to Jaylen Waddle.\n\nSmith was relatively quiet during the afternoon with two catches for 26 yards, but Jeudy posted six catches for 96 yards and two touchdowns. Ruggs was even better with four catches for 148 yards and two scores.\n\nIt is a testament to the talent across the wide receiver corps that they were both comfortable running whichever route they drew in a rock, paper, scissors game. Opponents have not been able to keep the Crimson Tide's aerial attack in check this season, and they likely won't be legitimately challenged until a Nov. 9 showdown with LSU.\n\nThere probably won't be any rock, paper, scissors opportunities in that one if it comes down to the wire.", "description": "It's not always fun and games on the football field during fall Saturdays, but it certainly was for the Alabama Crimson Tide during a commanding 49-7 victory over Southern Miss...", "authors": ["Scott Polacek"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/830/022/hi-res-3a5b751abf69f43477853a99ad0b6472_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
