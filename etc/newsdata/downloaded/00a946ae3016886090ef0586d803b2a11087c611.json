But there's an influential rank of female bankers, each with more than a decade of experience behind them, quietly guiding some of the biggest deals in the industry.\n\nJPMorgan and Goldman put their top women behind WeWork\n\nEven for those well-versed in IPOs, trying to parse out the bankers on WeWork's S-1 could make your head spin. The company lists its underwriters in an unconventional format \u2014 a circle \u2014 quashing most visual cues about which bank is lead left or lead right. Still, slightly to the left and on the top of the circle is JPMorgan, followed by its second in command, on the top to the right, Goldman Sachs.\n\nIf the IPO is a success, WeWork will have the bankers Takhtajan and Posnett to thank. Both are New York-based tech bankers with backgrounds in consumer-technology IPOs and years of experience.\n\nRead more: WeWork might be painting itself as a tech company, but it's facing a bunch of old-school real estate worries\n\nAs an equity-capital-markets banker, Takhtajan focuses mostly on deal execution. Execution in particular is key for WeWork, which could go public with an initial market cap of $20 billion, according to Bloomberg \u2014 less than half the $47 billion it was valued at in its last funding found.\n\nTakhtajan joined JPMorgan in 2002 after finishing her undergraduate degree at MIT, just a year after interning with JPMorgan. Over the past five years, she's focused exclusively on tech, media, and telecommunication (TMT) companies.\n\nAmong Takhtajan's biggest deals this year were IPOs for Lyft, Chewy, and Fiverr. In the case of WeWork, she's working closely alongside JPMorgan Vice Chairman Noah Wintroub.\n\nRead more: Meet the jet-setting Goldman Sachs banker who led Qualcomm through a hostile takeover, got stuck in Trump's trade war, and made magic happen across the semiconductor industry\n\nPosnett, a Goldman partner since 2016, is leading the IPO for the top-ranked investment bank. It's at least the ninth IPO that she's led, and she's already successfully brought companies like Pinterest, Etsy, and Stitch Fix public. And while Posnett didn't lead Goldman's effort on Uber's May IPO, which raised $8.1 billion for the company at a $75.5 billion initial market cap, she was second in command behind one of Goldman's most senior leaders, Gregg Lemkau, the cohead of the investment-banking division.\n\nPosnett, a member of Goldman's influential partnership committee, joined the investment bank in 2005. A graduate of Yale and the University of Pennsylvania's business school, Posnett was named in 2016 to the Forbes list of 40 women under 40. She's now the global head of internet investment banking and serves as cohead of TMT investment-banking services.\n\nMorgan Stanley banker was Airbnb's early champion\n\nAt Morgan Stanley, which Bloomberg said forfeited a role on the WeWork IPO, that banker is Kate Claassen, the global head of internet banking based out of Menlo Park, California.\n\nSources close to Claassen said she's played a pivotal role in the bank's relationship with Airbnb and was key to nabbing Morgan Stanley a role on the company's 2015 $1.5 billion private-funding round, which attracted investors such as Kleiner Perkins, Tiger Global, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, Temasek, and Baillie Gifford.\n\nShe was an early user of Airbnb and hosted her own house on the website, which meant that she was willing to work with the startup before other bankers, according to one of her colleagues. This meant Claassen also convinced Morgan Stanley to extend an $80 million revolving credit line to Airbnb back in 2013, when the company was relatively young.\n\nAirbnb is expected to go public in 2020, and people familiar with the company have said it's still weighing its options around a direct listing, an unconventional listing style pioneered by Spotify in 2018 and followed by Slack in June. Though direct listings don't have underwriters like conventional IPOs, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Allen & Company LLC have held top advising roles on both direct listings so far.\n\nClaassen joined the firm in 2007 after getting her MBA at UC Berkeley. She was one of the three key Morgan Stanley bankers on Uber. In her 12 years at the bank, Claassen has worked on big IPOs \u2014 for Twitter, Square, Roku, and Pandora. She has also managed more than a dozen debt offerings for companies including Netflix, Uber, and Amazon.\n\nDespite the influence of such senior women, the three banks still have a ways to go before they can claim gender parity at the uppermost ranks. At Goldman Sachs, just 21.6% of senior-level officials and managers were women in 2017, according to a demographics report. At JPMorgan, it was just 25.6%, according to its own 2017 report. Just 19% of Morgan Stanley's managing directors were women in 2017, according to the bank.", "description": "Three senior women \u2014 two bankers taking WeWork public and a third slated for Airbnb \u2014\u00a0are gaining influence in the largely male-led world of IPOs.", "authors": ["Becky Peterson", "Dakin Campbell"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d68215e2e22af277346db55-1536-768.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
