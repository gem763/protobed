After all, it\u2019s risky. Stocks tend to go up in the long run, making short selling seem like a losing proposition. Higher stock prices aren\u2019t the only vector for short-selling losses though. Stock lending fees can crimp short selling returns\u2014or add to short selling losses.\n\nTo sell a stock short investors must borrow actual shares from someone. For every stock sale there is a stock buyer and buyers want actual stock. Lenders of anything, including stocks, want to get paid for lending assets. When a particular short becomes popular, stock lending rates spike because it gets harder for short sellers to find shares to borrow.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s basic economics: supply and demand. There are more investors looking for shares to borrow\u2014the demand\u2014than the available supply to lend. When a situation like that arises, stock lenders are in the driver\u2019s seat and can demand high rates for borrowed shares.\n\nBorrowing Beyond Meat (ticker: BYND) shares, for instance, is beyond expensive. In fact, it\u2019s the most expensive stock to borrow in the world, according to data provider S3 Analytics. Short sellers are paying 141% to borrow stock. That\u2019s an annual rate.\n\nShort sellers would be paying far more than 100% of the price of Beyond Meat shares if they stayed short the entire year. That would make it impossible for the short sale to pay off, so clearly bearish investors don\u2019t expect to stay short for long\u2014they must believe Beyond\u2019s stock price will drop soon.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen Thursday though. Beyond shares rose 11.6% after McDonald\u2019s (MCD) said it was testing Beyond\u2019s products at stores in Canada. The test is a big win for the highflying alternative-meat startup.\n\nThe high borrowing cost illustrates how controversial the Beyond stock has become. Short sellers balk at the valuation while optimistic growth investors believe alternative-meat is more than a passing fad. The S3 data also shows \u201csmart money\u201d doesn\u2019t like several other highflying startups including Zoom Video Communication (ZM) and Tilray (TLRY). Beyond isn\u2019t the only \u201chard to borrow\u201d stock.\n\nInvestors shorting a basket of nine stocks with borrowing costs greater than 50% would have lost about 21% so far in 2019, according to the S3 report. And that\u2019s not considering stock borrowing costs. Including the cost to borrow shares, the loss would be closer to 60%.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about schadenfreude. There are lessons for investors in the stock lending data. The loss calculation is only theoretical. Most short sellers are keen to cut losses early if things aren\u2019t working. That's an important lesson for aspiring traders. What\u2019s more, the high borrowing costs can tell investors to prepare for volatility.\n\nBeyond meat shares, for instance, have gone from $42 to $234, back down under $140 a share before closing today at $154.34. It\u2019s been a wild ride for investors and for short sellers.\n\nHigh borrowing cost can also signal higher risk of a short squeeze\u2014the bane of short sellers existence. A short squeeze is a forced repurchase of shares sold short, usually at a much higher price, crystallizing losses for the bears.\n\nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com", "description": "Beyond Meat is the most expensive stock to borrow in the world, according to S3 Analytics.
