Robson and Jerome.\n\nNevertheless, the song from Liam and Noel Gallagher's second album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory, went on to become a true nineties anthem and continues to make the most-streamed Spotify list.\n\nBut not everyone is a fan, and no-one more so than the man who actually sung it.\n\nLiam, 47, was given the choice between Wonderwall and Don't Look Back In Anger and reluctantly chose the first, despite despising it.\n\n(Image: Front Page Media)\n\n(Image: Front Page Media)\n\nWhen Noel first played him the record in rehearsals - which had a different beat and was called Wishing Stone - Liam was reportedly incandescent.\n\n\"What do you think you\u2019re doing, d***head?\" he raged, according to NME. \"Oasis aren\u2019t a funk band.\u201d\n\nLiam was also supposed to appear on the artwork for the single - something Noel shut down with just minutes to spare when he arrived on set in a taxi.\n\n\"It's a f***ing love song... no way was Our Kid appearing on the cover,\" he said.\n\nAnd the director of the moody black and white video once revealed that filming descended into a brawl between the famously fiery brothers.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Entertainment)\n\n(Image: Front Page Media)\n\n\u201cIt was one of the most shocking arguments I\u2019d seen in 30 years of making films,\u201d Nigel Dick previously told The Mirror.\n\n\u201cThey just started yelling at each other out of nothing, really letting off.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were snarling, effing and blinding for about 90 seconds and I feared one might lift a fist. The whole crew took a pace backwards.\n\n\u201cThen just before it really escalated one of them turned around and walked away.\n\n\"It was the first time I\u2019d seen the distaste they had for each other at a certain level. Nothing was said about it and I just filmed them on their own after that.\u201d\n\nIts fractious birth aside, the record - which was named loosely after George Harrison's first post-Beatles album Wonderwall Music - went on to become a worldwide hit.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\nNoel was quoted as saying he'd written it for his then-wife Meg Matthews, but in 2002 stated it was actually about an \"imaginary friend\" who was going to save him from himself.\n\nMeanwhile, the definition of the actual word 'wonderwall' was perhaps most bizarrely described by Liam, who vaguely summised that, \"A wonderwall can be anything.\"\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\n\"It's just a beautiful word. It's like looking for that bus ticket, and you're trying to f***ing find it, that b**tard, and you finally find it and you pull it out, 'F***ing mega, that is me wonderwall,'\" he told Rolling Stone in 1996.\n\nBut while the word might be beautiful, Liam once admitted he \"can't f***ing stand that f***ing song!\"\n\n\"Every time I have to sing it I want to gag,\" he said, although he does perform it with his band Beady Eye to give fans what they want.\n\n\"Problem is, it was a big, big tune for us. You go to America and they're like: 'Are you Mr Wonderwall?' You want to chin someone.\"\n\n", "description": "Oasis rocker Liam Gallagher had nothing nice to say when his brother Noel Gallagher first played him Wonderwall - and he still doesn't now", "authors": ["Frances Kindon", "Image", "Front Page Media", "Empics Entertainment", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Wireimage"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743450.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Music-Oasis-Wonderwall-Video.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
