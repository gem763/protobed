That's \"not just a replaced carpet or new chairs,\" Gulliksen said. While that's a high number, it is more cost effective than building a new ship, he added.\n\nSome of the new features include:\n\nCasual food and beverage options.\n\nA new water park.\n\nTheater and other live entertainment.\n\nUpdates to state rooms and two redesigned Captain's suites.\n\nThe Carnival Sunrise, docked in Grand Turk, Bahamas.
