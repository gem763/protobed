South Korean players later said the North Korean players were unnecessarily physical and verbally abusive during the match.\n\nNorth Korea in recent months has suspended virtually all cooperation with the South amid deadlocked nuclear negotiations with the United States, and ignored the South\u2019s calls for discussions on media coverage and allowing South Korean fans to attend ahead of Tuesday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201c(The letter) expressed regret over North Korea\u2019s failure to separate sports and politics and said its actions over the match should be reviewed for discipline,\u201d Shin said. \u201cWe also called for AFC efforts to ensure something like this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nSouth Korean Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul, Seoul\u2019s point man on North Korea, told lawmakers on Thursday that the way the North handled the game was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d and reflected the standstill in inter-Korean relations.\n\nDuring qualifying for the 2010 World Cup, North Korea chose to host games against South Korea in Shanghai, refusing to hoist the South Korean flag and play the South Korean anthem on its soil.\n\nThe fate of the game in Pyongyang was uncertain until last month when the AFC informed the KFA that the North decided it would host its Group H match against the South as scheduled.\n\nGroup H also includes Lebanon, Turkmenistan and Sri Lanka.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The South Korean soccer association said Friday it has requested that North Korea be punished for blocking rival fans and media from attending a World Cup qualifier between the countries at an empty stadium in Pyongyang.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kim Tong-Hyung"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/18/south_korea_koreas_world_cup_qualifier_22777_c0-172-4122-2576_s1200x700.jpg?8d33564e2e56f34f543c1569d3eb19570d6bbf27", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
