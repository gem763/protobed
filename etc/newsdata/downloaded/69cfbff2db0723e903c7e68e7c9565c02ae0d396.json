Massive marches have rocked the island, with police at times responding with tear gas, petrol bombs and live rounds.\n\nThe protests, which began with demonstrations against a bill that would have allowed some Hong Kong residents to be extradited to the Chinese mainland, have grown violent. They expanded after the bill was suspended and declared \"dead\" by Lam to include several other demands as concerns grew that Beijing was looking to tighten its control over the semi-autonomous territory.\n\nChina has accused the U.S. and other western countries of stirring up the protests, saying it has not expanded its reach in Hong Kong.\n\nIncreased scrutiny has arisen over the protests, which have grown more violent in recent days. Protesters and police clashed over the weekend, with activists throwing 20 petrol bombs at one police station. Another explosive device was detonated remotely to target a passing police car and an officer had his neck slashed by a protester, according to Reuters.\n\nLam said police have arrested over 2,300 people since the demonstrations began in June, including scores of teenagers.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s response to the protests has sparked particularly harsh criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill, with Sen.
