On the contrary, in fact.\n\nRuby Tandoh (series 4), Steven Carter-Bailey (series 8), and James Morton (series 3) were all awarded Star Baker on an impressive three occasions without being crowned champion, while Richard Burr was Star Baker five times in 2014 before only finishing runner-up.\n\nCandice Brown and Nadiya Hussain (GBBO winners in 2016 and 2015 respectively) both won Star Baker three times, although in Nadiya\u2019s case this was still less than Ian Cumming (four) who was even Star Baker in three out of the first four rounds ultimately to no avail.\n\nMeanwhile, the winners of series 2, 3, 4, and 5, (Jo Wheatley, John Whaite, Frances Quinn, and Nancy Birtwhistle) were Star Baker only once and Sophie Faldo (series 8) just twice (like a lot of contestants).\n\nSo on this evidence, going into Festival Week Steph Blackwell was already doomed, and her five \u2018rivals' even (possibly) hoping she\u2019d be Star Baker for a fourth time more than she was - to seal her fate.\n\nChuffed: The 21-year-old student was decidedly thrilled to win the praise of the tough judge\n\nSadly, kamikaze-ly, Steph had another impressive round.\n\nSumming up before the judges announced their decision, Paul Hollywood reflected she was in the running for Star Baker again - \u2018along with Henry and possibly David\u2019.\n\nDavid had come second in the Technical Challenge but then annoyed Prue Leith with the size of his Showstopper (as it were). Admittedly, as you can see from the selection of Prue\u2019s comments below, this wasn\u2019t difficult tonight but it cost him nonetheless.\n\nSteph had certainly made a disastrously good start in the Signature Challenge when her witty twist on hot cross buns (with cranberries, sultanas, and cinnamon) were so good she received the (supposed) accolade of a Paul Hollywood handshake.\n\n\u2018I won\u2019t wash!\u2019 she beamed afterwards, hopefully but not definitely joking.\n\nWhen it was all over, as Paul and Prue adjourned to decide the week\u2019s winner and loser, David summed it up, saying: \u2018It\u2019s really close, I think. Anyone could go. Myself, Alice, Michael and Rosie have all had positives and negatives.\u2019\n\nNoticeably, understandably, his list didn\u2019t include Steph, who had lacked the latter - unlike Michael (who lacked positives) and had been average/poor throughout the competition, so rightly the one to leave.\n\nChallenge: The hopefuls were seen being put through their paces for the show's Festival Week\n\nIt meant that Steph again looked a cut above the rest, with Henry her only real rival for the title.\n\nAll of which helped ensure Festival Week was unusual. Under the auspices of Channel 4 it certainly no longer merely involved baking cakes related to traditional cultural/religious festivals from Britain.\n\nRosie won the Technical Challenge for her Sicilian Cassatelle (\u2018pastry crescents filled with a ricotta, flavoured with chocolate and orange\u2019) while the Showstopper involved making a Battenberg-style \u2018Kek Lapis layer cake\u2019 found in festival celebrations in the Sarawak region of Malaysia.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve heard of Malaysia before. I haven\u2019t heard of Sarawak or Kek Lapis layer cake,\u2019 said Henry.\n\nFor the Signature meanwhile, Rosie made a \u2018Semla namelaka\u2019 (pastry buns associated with Finland's Mardi Gras celebrations). Henry\u2019s Kardemummabullar cardamom buns were Swedish.\n\n\u2018Your flavours are good, the proving\u2019s good, the bake\u2019s good, the colour is good, and the technique\u2019s good\u2026\u2019 Paul Hollywood told Henry, which seemed to cover it, before also bestowing upon the 21 year-old student the \u2018honour\u2019 of shaking his hand.\n\nNear miss: The bookies\u2019 favourite to win The Great British Bake Off, Steph Blackwell, narrowly failed to make history and become Star Baker for a remarkable four weeks running\n\n\u2018Shut up!\u2019 gasped Henry, as young people are prone to.\n\nPaul Hollywood wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled but it didn\u2019t stop Henry from becoming week eight\u2019s Star Baker, luckily for Henry - and for Steph.\n\nThese were Prue Leith\u2019s best/worst/bitchiest moments in \u2018Festival Week\u2019:\n\n1. Prue\u2019s damning putdown of Alice\u2019s lemon, blueberry and almond hot cross buns in the Signature Challenge\n\nPaul Hollywood: \u2018You baked them well but there\u2019s a pretty irregular colour and size going on there.'\n\nPrue: \u2018Well they look homemade.\u2019 - Ouch!\n\n2. Prue\u2019s reaction to Alice\u2019s casatelle pastries\n\nPaul: \u2018They\u2019ve popped open in the fryer and puffed up.\u2019\n\nPrue: \u2018Like some kind of seafood creature!\u2019 - Miaow! (the sea creature version)\n\n3. Prue\u2019s withering assessment when she tasted Rosie\u2019s Sarawak-style Showstopper, which Rosie had created by making two eight-layer lemon and mixed spiced sponge cakes which will be cut into a square cross-section, then halved into a triangle, then halved again into another triangle, and then re-assembled into a diamond pattern\u2019\n\nPrue: \u2018What is the jam inside?\u2019 - Never a good sign from someone judging a cake.\n\n4. Prue\u2019s comment when Henry proudly showed the judges a detailed diagram of what he\u2019d planned for his Malaysian-style \u2018Elegant Present Box lemon & lime Sarawak cake\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s probably a mistake to show us that \u2013 because we might be disappointed if you don\u2019t achieve it.\u2019\n\n5. Prue\u2019s ambivalent assessment of David\u2019s stunning-looking Showstopper, which consisted of \u2018contrasting monochrome and multi-coloured cakes flavoured with a traditional Indonesian spice mix brushed with tamarind and honey to form a post-modernist work of art\u2019\n\nPrue: \u2018My first impression is it\u2019s architecturally very interesting. My next is that it\u2019s very small.\u2019 - Yes but which of those is more important?\n\n(Prue, making it clear: \u2018This was supposed to be a cake for a lot of people.\u2019)\n\n6. Prue actually tasting Alice\u2019s lemon, blueberry and almond hot cross buns\n\n\u2018I always think lemon curd glaze is not as attractive - because it\u2019s not shiny enough.\u2019 - OK, so you really didn\u2019t like Alice\u2019s hot cross buns\n\n7. Prue hinting at what she does like, seeing Michael\u2019s \u2018figgy pudding hot cross buns\u2019\n\nPaul: \u2018They\u2019re misshapen because of the volume of fruit.\u2019\n\nPrue: \u2018But they\u2019re lovely and shiny!\u2019\n\n8. Prue confirming where her priorities lie, seeing Steph\u2019s cranberry and cinnamon hot cross buns\n\n\u2018I do think they look very shiny and very attractive. My mouth is watering!\u2019 - Anything shiny basically...", "description": "The bookies' favourite to win The Great British Bake Off, Steph Blackwell, narrowly failed to make history and become Star Baker for a remarkable four weeks running.", "authors": ["Jim Shelley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/21/19460786-0-image-a-70_1570566437452.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
