For an excessively long time, I had absolutely no clue about my super. It was just something that people would ask me about when I started a new job \u2013 and I started a lot of new jobs as I was going through high school and uni.\n\nEvery single time I\u2019d fill in the paperwork, the name of my super account would absolutely escape me. I\u2019d select employer\u2019s super fund every time, in order to get it over and done with (YES I KNOW THIS IS BAD).\n\nSo it meant that at one point, I had about seven different super accounts open (YES I KNOW THIS IS WORSE). I had no idea what was in what, and at the time I didn\u2019t even know that it was a bad thing.\n\nTurns out, your super is actually, well, super important to stay on top of. All those accounts I had? Yeah\u2026 They were losing me money if you think about it. And I like money. I like money a LOT.\n\nBasically, because my super was being split across so many accounts (instead of being consolidated like a good adult), I was paying a huge steaming pile of fees that I straight up didn\u2019t have to be paying.\n\nSo if you\u2019re in the same situation as me, I bet you\u2019re feeling pretty foolish right about now, hey? Might be kicking yourself, even, for being so lackadaisical with your super. Silly! You probably wanna know exactly how to fix this mess you\u2019re in.\n\nWell, friend. If you\u2019re stuck in non-consolidated super land, paying a pile of fees, here\u2019s how you get out.\n\nAll you gotta do is research to find a super fund that aligns best with your financial interests. Think about where you want all your future jobs to chuck the employee contributions, look ahead to whether rolling it all over will cost you any moula, and check out if you\u2019ll lose insurance benefits from your current provider.\n\nOr, in my case, providers. Whoops.\n\nAccording to ASIC, the things you\u2019ll want to research most are the total balance from all your providers (to peep the fees for your grand total), where the potential providers invest your super (so that you don\u2019t wind up investing in something you\u2019re not about), the fees involved (lemme keep my money pls) and the level of insurance on your super (again, lemme keep my money pls).\n\nThen you just need to consolidate. Basically, this means whacking all those non-essential superannuation accounts into the one that\u2019s going to be right for you \u2013 and stop paying for a bunch of things you don\u2019t even need.\n\nAnd for the record, it doesn\u2019t have to be a super fund you\u2019re already with, or even the one with the largest amount of money in it at the moment. The best one for you might be one with a smaller amount in it, or a new fund altogether.\n\nSo you could opt for something like an ING Living Super account, which is super easy to consolidate everything into because you can sort it out online. You can check your super balance from your fave device, and if you need to change anything then there are some lovely humans you can chat to as well.\n\nThen it\u2019s all in one spot and you don\u2019t need to stress about how dodgy your life will be when you hit retirement and your budget is less than the luxe life you deserve.\n\nNice.\n\nThis article was sponsored by ING (ING Bank (Australia) Limited ABN 24 000 893 292, Australian Financial Service Licence 229823) and written by PEDESTRIAN.TV.
