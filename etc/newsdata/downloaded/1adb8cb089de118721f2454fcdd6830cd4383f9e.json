The drugs are thought to have caused Miller\u2019s death in September 2018.\n\nCameron Pettit, 28, of West Hollywood, Calif.; Stephen Walter, 46, of Los Angeles; and Ryan Reavis, 36, of Lake Havasu City, Ariz., were previously charged with drug-related offenses.

None have entered a plea.\n\nMiller -- his real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick -- died of an accidental overdose of the powerful opioid fentanyl, along with cocaine and alcohol. He was 26.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Walter supplied the fentanyl and cocaine that Pettit sold to Miller, and that Reavis, who lived in the Los Angeles area until earlier this year, acted as a middleman for the fentanyl sale.\n\nRAPPER MAC MILLER DEAD AT 26\n\nAccording to the indictment, on Sept. 5, 2018, Pettit allegedly sold Miller cocaine, Xanax and 10 blue pills -- reportedly oxycodone, but also containing fentanyl -- after the two had exchanged text messages a day earlier.\n\nTwo days later, Miller\u2019s assistant found him dead at his Los Angeles home.\n\nWalter\u2019s attorney, William S. Harris, told The Associated Press he was reviewing the indictment and other elements of the case, and could not immediately comment.
