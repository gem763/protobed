They're been in the market buying some agriculture commodities from the US - soybeans, pork and wheat and other things. That's a good sign,\" he said in a Fox News interview.\n\n\"It is possible that some additional progress will be made with China toward the end of the week,\" he said.\n\nConcern on Wall Street has been rising along with 2020 Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren's poll numbers. But worries about her potential success may be overdone, according to RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Any pain from a Warren win is likely to be temporary,\" Lori Calvasina, RBC's head of US equity strategy, wrote in a report Monday that was partially underpinned by a survey of RBC industry analysts. \"Most of the sectors at high risk under a Warren presidency from a policy perspective (Financials, Energy, Health Care, Industrials) are already deeply undervalued versus the broader market.\"\n\nAny breakups of big technology companies \"would be a problem\" for a few stocks with \"mega\" market capitalisations, though it could be a positive for retailers and others that have suffered from the rise of Amazon.com Inc., she wrote. And regional banks might be hurt less than the bigger financials, she said.\n\n\"The stock market tends to go up over time, regardless of who occupies the White House,\" Calvasina wrote. \"Ultimately we think Corporate America and US equity investors would learn to adapt to new political leadership, as they always do.\"\n\nEurope\n\nEuropean shares rose on Monday, after their steepest weekly loss in two months, as bids in defensive shares outweighed nervousness ahead of crucial US-China trade talks and Brexit negotiations.\n\nThe food and beverage sector was among the top gainers, while Bayer's 1.4% rise helped the healthcare index climb 0.9%.\n\nBayer's gain, which also lifted peers in the chemical sector , was spurred by the company saying a pending US lawsuit over claims related to glyphosate-based herbicide Roundup has been delayed until further notice.\n\nTracking a rise in oil prices, energy stocks were also among the biggest sectoral gainers on the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 0.7%, after it tumbled 3% last week on tensions over a possible transatlantic trade war and a spate of weak US and European data.\n\nGermany's DAX erased early losses to end 0.7% higher, while Spain's IBEX rose almost 1%.\n\n\"The rather weak macro data last week has increased expectations of further interest rate cuts, especially in the US.. and are supporting equity markets,\" said Ingo Schachel, head of equity research at Commerzbank.\n\nThe inflow of poor economic prints continued on Monday, as data showed German industrial orders in August fell slightly more than expected, underscoring concerns of a recession in Europe's largest economy.\n\nAsia\n\nUS and Chinese deputy trade negotiators launched a new round of talks on Monday, Washington time, aimed at resolving the two nations' 15-month trade war, with neither side showing any signs of giving ground.\n\nThe White House officially confirmed that the high-level talks, involving Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would begin on Thursday.\n\n\"The two sides will look to build on the deputy-level talks of the past weeks. Topics of discussion will include forced technology transfer, intellectual property rights, services, non-tariff barriers, agriculture, and enforcement,\" White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe talks are getting underway about a week before a scheduled increase in US tariffs on $US250 billion worth of Chinese goods, to 30% from 25%. US President Donald Trump has said the tariff increase will take effect if no progress is made in the negotiations.\n\nCurrencies\n\nSurprise drop in China's currency reserves: While China attributed the decline to currency fluctuations, some economists were sceptical after the yuan bounced back in September from a sharp fall the previous month.\n\nTurkey's lira slid to its lowest level in more than a month against the US dollar over concerns about Ankara's planned incursion in north Syria and a warning from President Donald Trump that he could 'obliterate' the Turkish economy.\n\nThe lira declined more than 1.6%, trading at 5.795 at 1600 GMT, after closing at 5.7000 on Friday. Earlier, it slipped as far as 5.8195, its weakest level since September 3.\n\n\"While the statement from the United States gives a green light to the military operation in Syria that Turkey has mentioned for a long time, it leaves many question marks regarding how the process will develop,\" said a forex trader, who did not want to be named.\n\nTurkey's dollar bonds also fell, with the 2038 issue down 1.3 cents.\n\nTurkey's lira lost nearly 30% against the US dollar last year, over concerns about political interference with monetary policy, as well as a deterioration in ties between Washington and Ankara. It is down about 8% this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommodities\n\nCopper rose on Monday ahead of fresh US-China trade talks this week,.\n\nBenchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) ended 1.4% higher at $US5720 a tonne.\n\nOn-warrant inventories of copper in LME-registered warehouses slipped 675 tonnes to 194,200 tonnes, having grown by 33,000 tonnes last week.\n\nLME copper remained in a deep contango, indicating plentiful supply. The discount of LME cash copper to the three-month contract was at $35 a tonne, the biggest discount since August 2018.\n\nAluminium added 1.6% to $US1746 a tonne.\n\nFitch downgraded Saudi Aramco's credit rating by one notch to \"A\", days after it cut its sovereign rating on the country. Fitch kept its outlook at stable.\n\nCerrejon, one of Colombia's largest coal mines, will reduce its operations by up to 18% because of a fall in international prices and amid an ongoing court case, the company's chief executive said. Colombia is the world's fourth-largest exporter of coal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustralian sharemarket\n\nAustralian shares rose 0.7 per cent on Monday, bolstered by robust US jobs data, and defying low trading volumes to recover from its worst week in 11 months.\n\nProminent resources and financial companies proved a drag on the ASX across Monday's trading session. AAP\n\nThe benchmark S &P/ASX 200 Index rose 46.5 points to finish the day at 6563.6 points, and the All Ordinaries Index added 49.8 points, or 0.8 per cent, to close at 6686.7 points.\n\nLeading the ASX's gains was biopharmaceutical giant CSL, which rose 1.4 per cent to $239.59. Credit Suisse maintained its \"outperform\" recommendation on the stock and kept its $249 target price.\n\n\"In the short term, with CSL's key competitors reporting various supply disruptions and limited product availability, CSL has the opportunity to gain [market] share,\" the analysts said.\n\nThe major banks were also in the green, defying pressure induced by the prospect of a fresh inquiry into their competitiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStreet Talk\n\nDone deal: Affinity investors ready for high Velocity payday\n\nGlobal restructuring firm Ankura enters Australian market\n\nNext taps Stanton Road to help Lynch Group sale bloom", "description": "Australian shares are poised to open higher, extending Monday's modest advance.
