(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nEver since the revelation in the summer of 2016 that Russia was hacking the Democratic National Committee to help elect Donald Trump, his critics have been searching for evidence that he is loyal to Russia. We still don\u2019t know the full story of President Trump\u2019s ties with Moscow; an FBI counterintelligence investigation is apparently still going on. But from what we know, it\u2019s a mistake to imagine that Trump is loyal to any country \u2014 whether the United States or Russia. His only loyalty is to himself. His policy is not \u201cAmerica First.\u201d It is Trump First.\n\nThat message was hammered home by the revelations of last week. The week\u2019s major news story \u2014 the one that has made impeachment inevitable \u2014 is that Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to launch an investigation of Joe Biden. The president\u2019s own words, in the rough transcript released by the White House, convict him of two offenses against U.S. interests. First, he encouraged a foreign country to interfere in a U.S. election despite a federal law that makes it a crime to \u201cknowingly solicit, accept, or receive from a foreign national any contribution or donation.\u201d Second, apparently as a pressure tactic, he held up military aid for Ukraine that was authorized by Congress to help this front-line ally defend itself against Russian aggression.\n\nWhether it can be proved that Trump acted criminally (and it will be hard to put a value on the campaign aid that Trump wanted from Ukraine), he deserves to be impeached because he violated his oath to \u201cpreserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d He subordinated the public\u2019s interest \u2014 in holding free and fair elections and ensuring that foreign aid is used for the purposes intended by Congress \u2014 to his own personal interest in getting reelected.\n\nTrump acted with similar disregard for the national interest during and after Russia\u2019s intervention in the 2016 election. Though former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that Trump was part of a criminal conspiracy with Moscow, there remains ample evidence of his willingness to encourage Russian interference. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening,\u201d Trump said on July 27, 2016, encouraging Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. The Mueller report revealed that Russian hackers tried to do that just hours later.\n\nTrump has often denied that the Russians were responsible for the hacking of the DNC \u2014 most infamously when he was standing next to Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. That this may not be entirely for show is evident from Trump\u2019s eagerness to get Ukraine to investigate the computer security firm CrowdStrike, which first found Russia\u2019s fingerprints all over the hack. Trump seems to subscribe to a right-wing conspiracy theory that the hack was an \u201cinside job.\u201d\n\nBut consistency is certainly not Trump\u2019s hobgoblin. On Friday, The Post reported that Trump \u201ctold two senior Russian officials in a 2017 Oval Office meeting that he was unconcerned about Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election because the United States did the same in other countries.\u201d This is highly damning, because it shows Trump conceding \u2014 and condoning \u2014 Russian complicity. Trump is thereby giving the Russians implicit permission to strike again. Once again, Trump is placing his own interest above the interests of the country.\n\nThis is part of a pattern with Trump \u2014 and undoubtedly a big reason, as the CIA whistleblower revealed, Trump aides placed transcripts of his conversations with several world leaders in a computer system meant for only the most sensitive secrets. CNN reported that the restricted transcripts include \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 Trump\u2019s talks with Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nWhat the White House tapes were to the Nixon White House, the transcripts of these phone calls are for the Trump White House. Unfortunately, it is doubtful that we can get them the way that special prosecutor Leon Jaworski got access to President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s \u201csmoking gun\u201d tape: by subpoenaing it. In 1974, a unanimous Supreme Court overrode Nixon\u2019s claims of \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d in the interests of \u201cdue process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice.\u201d Nixon resigned 16 days later.\n\nHarvard Law professor Laurence Tribe tells me the current Supreme Court \u201cwouldn\u2019t regard U.S. v. Nixon as controlling,\u201d both because the court is now more conservative and because (unlike in 1974) there is no ongoing criminal prosecution of presidential aides that requires the documents. But Tribe suggests that the transcripts may come out anyway: \u201cNow that impeachment is all but inevitable, the sinking ship will spring one leak after another.\u201d\n\nThere is, to be sure, a legitimate interest in preserving the confidentiality of presidential phone calls. But there is an even stronger interest in preserving the integrity of the presidency. So, White House aides, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019ll be able to find the transcripts that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press \u2014 and, more important, by posterity. Now is the time to act like John Dean \u2014 not like H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: The Ukraine facts are clear.
