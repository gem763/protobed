The request for a delay until Jan. 31 was ordered by Britain\u2019s Parliament to avert the economic damage that could come from a no-deal exit.\n\nThough the EU has not given its answer, Johnson said it looked like the EU would grant the extension \u2014 and with it kill off Johnson\u2019s oft-repeated promise that Britain will leave the EU at the end of this month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid it looks as though our EU friends are going to respond to Parliament\u2019s request by having an extension, which I really don\u2019t want at all,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nBritain\u2019s next scheduled election is in 2022. If Johnson wants an early election, he needs to win a vote in Parliament by a two-thirds majority, or lose a no-confidence vote, which so far opposition parties have refused to call.\n\nThe main opposition Labour Party has said it would \u201csupport a general election when the threat of a no-deal crash-out is off the table.\u201d\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk has recommended that the other 27 EU nations grant Britain a delay, yet many of the bloc\u2019s members are weary and frustrated at Britain\u2019s interminable Brexit melodrama. But they also want to avoid the economic pain that would come to both sides from a sudden and disruptive British exit.\n\nSo they are likely to agree, although politicians in France say President Emmanuel Macron is pushing for a shorter extension than the three months that Britain has asked for.\n\nJohnson has vowed that, sooner or later, the U.K. will leave the EU on the terms of the deal he negotiated with the bloc.\n\nHe said the Dec. 12 election date would give lawmakers more time to scrutinize his bill, because Parliament would be in session until the formal campaign started on Nov. 6.\n\n\u201cSo, the way to get this done, the way to get Brexit done, is, I think, to be reasonable with Parliament and say if they genuinely want more time to study this excellent deal they can have it, but they have to agree to a general election on Dec. 12,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nMeanwhile, U.K. police and politicians have sounded alarms about what could happen in Northern Ireland under Johnson\u2019s proposed Brexit deal, with the region\u2019s police chief warning that a badly handled divorce from the European Union could bring violence back onto the streets.\n\nPolice have long warned that if Britain\u2019s departure from the EU imposes a hard border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, that could embolden Irish Republican Army splinter groups who are opposed to Northern Ireland\u2019s peace process and power-sharing government.\n\nPolice Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable Simon Byrne told the BBC on Wednesday there also was potential for unrest among Northern Ireland\u2019s pro-British loyalist community. He said, depending on how Brexit unfolded, there could be \u201ca lot of emotion in loyalist communities and the potential for civil disorder.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a small number of people in both the loyalist and nationalist communities that are motivated by their own ideology and that have the potential to bring violence back onto the streets,\u201d he said.\n\nThe all-but invisible Irish border now underpins both the regional economy and the peace process that ended decades of violence in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Brexit divorce deal struck last week between Johnson and the 27 other European Union countries contains measures to keep the Irish border open. But the plan has been condemned by Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, an ally of Johnson\u2019s Conservatives. The DUP says the agreement\u2019s proposal to keep Northern Ireland in line with EU goods and customs regulations would impose new checks and friction between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Conservative government acknowledges that \u201cadministrative procedures including a declaration will be required\u201d on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland after Brexit, but it says they would be minimal.\n\nDUP lawmaker Nigel Dodds warned Thursday that the British government risked undermining \u201cthe political institutions and political stability in Northern Ireland by what you are doing to the unionist community.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease wake up and realize what is happening here,\u201d he told the House of Commons. \u201cWe need to get our heads together here and look at a way forward that can solve this problem. Don\u2019t plow ahead regardless, I urge you.\u201d", "description": "To call an early election Johnson needs to win a vote in Parliament which he has tried twice before and lost.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR336_boris__ZG_20190916053157.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
