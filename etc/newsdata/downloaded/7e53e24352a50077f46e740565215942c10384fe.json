As Cris Collinsworth pointed out on the NBC broadcast, left tackle Jake Matthews deserves a lot of credit for a fantastic block to give Matt Ryan enough time to get Jones the ball. Jones credited fellow receiver Mohamed Sanu for a great block on the perimeter. It was a great play call against the Eagles\u2019 pressure. Then Jones pulled away from the defense to turn a 20-17 deficit into a 24-20 lead. The Falcons held on when Zach Ertz was tackled by cornerback Isaiah Oliver just short of a first down with less than a minute left on a fourth-down play.\n\nBefore that, the Falcons needed Jones to come up with a big play, and he delivered at exactly the right time.\n\nJulio Jones makes a huge play\n\nThe Falcons were in trouble before Jones\u2019 big play.\n\nThe Eagles suffered multiple injuries and didn\u2019t play well, but the Falcons couldn\u2019t put them away. A rough interception by Ryan into the end zone in the third quarter turned the momentum of the game around. The Eagles took a 20-17 lead on a quarterback sneak by Carson Wentz.\n\nThe Falcons were 0-1 after being blown out in the opener at Minnesota. Falling to 0-2 after squandering a lead against a beat-up Eagles team would have been brutal.\n\nStory continues\n\nJones signed a three-year, $66 million contract extension just before the season started. He\u2019s a future Hall of Famer and well worth the money. It\u2019s hard to say Jones saved Atlanta\u2019s season with his big touchdown, but let\u2019s say that he saved the Falcons from a really long week of misery.\n\nEagles let one slip away\n\nThe Eagles will have some regrets. For a while it seemed Wentz had dragged his team to a victory, even with starting receivers Alshon Jeffery and DeSean Jackson out for most of the game with injuries. Tight end Dallas Goedert was also out due to a calf injury he suffered before the game in warmups.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Wentz\u2019s best performance, but it epitomized his toughness. Wentz made one of the more improbable throws you\u2019ll see late in the fourth quarter. He was being dragged down by Vic Beasley from behind and somehow got off a pass to Mack Hollins that went for 17 yards. He got the pass off an instant before his knees touched the turf. It was remarkable how he got enough velocity on the pass to get it to Hollins, but he did.\n\nTo end the drive, Wentz converted a quarterback sneak on third-and-1, then another quarterback sneak got into the end zone to give Philadelphia the lead with 3:13 left.\n\nAfter Jones grabbed the lead back for Atlanta, Wentz put a perfect pass on Nelson Agholor\u2019s hands inside of the two-minute warning. Agholor dropped it. He probably would have scored. Agholor helped make up for that with a catch on a desperation fourth-down heave by Wentz to keep their final drive alive. But Oliver\u2019s big tackle on Ertz ended it.\n\nWentz deserves credit for his heroics on Sunday night, even in a loss. Jones just wouldn\u2019t let the Falcons fall to 0-2.\n\nAtlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones (11) scored the game-winning touchdown against the Eagles.
