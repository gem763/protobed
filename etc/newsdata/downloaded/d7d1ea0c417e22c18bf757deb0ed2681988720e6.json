Washington and Riyadh blame Iran for that attack.\n\nAl-Masirah TV said 16 people in one building - including seven children - died in strikes carried out by the Saudi-led coalition. There was no immediate comment from the coalition.\n\nSaudi Arabia leads a coalition that intervened in 2015 to restore the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which the Houthis ousted from power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014. It has carried out many air strikes in Houthi areas.\n\nTwo residents told Reuters that 17 people had died in the strikes on Qataba, a frontline town which lies on the main north-south route between Houthi-controlled Sanaa and the southern port city of Aden.\n\nAden is nominally the interim seat of Yemen's internationally recognised government, but southern separatists seized control of the city last month.\n\nViolence from both sides during the war has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed millions to the brink of famine.\n\nNine people, including three children, died this month when shelling from Houthi-controlled territory hit their house south of the major port city of Hodeidah, medical sources told Reuters.\n\nThe medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said eight women and one child had been admitted to a nearby hospital after shelling.
