A recent uptick in deaths and illnesses linked to vaping has refocused a spotlight on how many young people are using related products.\n\n\"CDC's not a regulatory agency,\" Schuchat said, \"but we have been raising the alarm about e-cigarettes and youth since 2013, when we first saw the rise.\"\n\nPHOTO: Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy secretary of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, testifies before a House Oversight and Reform's Economic and Consumer Policy Subcommittee hearing in Washington, September 24, 2019. (Tom Brenner/Reuters) More\n\nThe Trump administration announced it would move to ban flavored tobacco products in response to concern over how many teens are using e-cigarettes to ingest nicotine. The National Youth Tobacco Survey has found e-cigarettes are becoming more popular among high school students -- more than 20% reported using e-cigarettes last year.\n\nThe FDA, which regulates tobacco, said many current e-cigarette products are on the market illegally because they haven't been approved by the agency as a product with public health benefits. That requirement was added to electronic tobacco products in 2016, but it wasn't immediately enforced.\n\nSharpless, in his Wednesday testimony, said the agency gave companies additional time to comply and wouldn't enforce the requirement as long as producers submitted applications before an established deadline.\n\nAfter a legal challenge to some of the FDA's policies on new tobacco products, a federal court gave companies until May 2020 to submit applications for agency approval, though the decision did not block FDA from enforcing requirements before then.\n\nThe FDA and agencies like the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating e-cigarette companies like Juul and whether they have been illegally advertising their products to minors.\n\nThe FDA said it plans to prioritize enforcement of that requirement for flavored e-cigarette products that are believed to be targeting young people.\n\n(MORE: Juul CEO steps down amid vaping controversy)\n\nDrastic increases in the number of young people using e-cigarettes and vaping products were recorded before the CDC and FDA began investigating the recent outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries. Sharpless said the outbreak presents a different set of problems for regulators because a lot of people affected have reported using e-cigarette products with THC, which is illegal on the federal level and largely regulated by states.\n\n\"To the extent those products are being reviewed and regulated, it generally occurs at the state level,\" he said during his testimony.\n\nPHOTO: Rep.
