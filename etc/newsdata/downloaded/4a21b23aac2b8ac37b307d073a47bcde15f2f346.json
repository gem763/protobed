Heisey said the response he has received from reenactors, spectators and Gettysburg residents has been \u201coverwhelming.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A veteran Civil War reenactor in Pennsylvania says he will take over planning a 2020 reenactment of the battle of Gettysburg after the organization behind the annual event said it didn't intend to host one next summer", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2016/08/27/exchange_historical_re-enacting_costs_c0-135-3245-2027_s1770x1032.jpeg?2df2c1851862610eb9434980bcae70e608a08e1e", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
