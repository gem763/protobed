And if the answer is yes, they will stop or terminate the account.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a single banker in the world will look at that and say, \u2018yeah, we will do that.\u2019 Not a single one,\u201d Cullis said, referring to the option of reporting monthly to Treasury on the special due diligence that would be required to maintain a correspondent relationship with a foreign bank that has an account on behalf of an Iranian bank.\n\nSwiss banks have told Treasury that if it goes forward with the Section 311 finding they will terminate the accounts they maintain with Iranian banks to permit humanitarian trade, Cullis said.\n\nAnnouncing the humanitarian \u201ctransparency\u201d mechanism in the context of the Treasury determination that Iran is a primary money laundering jurisdiction will increase suspicions that it is a sanctions trap, agreed former State Department sanctions expert and Iran nuclear negotiator Richard Nephew.\n\n\u201cIn the context of the 311 finding AND general atmosphere, I suspect most will see this mechanism less as a humanitarian channel and more as an intelligence gathering function to enable additional US sanctions,\u201d Nephew, now with Columbia University, tweeted. \u201cFor those of us seeking a real channel, this ain\u2019t it.\u201d\n\nAl-Monitor understands that the Treasury announcement spinning the 311 finding as a special humanitarian transparency measure may also be an attempt to preempt negative publicity from an anticipated forthcoming report from a human rights group on the humanitarian impact of US sanctions on Iran.\n\n\u201cI think this will probably have a chilling effect on the few people who are still exporting these [humanitarian] goods, especially those in Europe,\u201d O\u2019Toole told Al-Monitor. \u201cIt flies directly in the face of the EU blocking regulation, and could actually expose European companies trying to use this mechanism to legal jeopardy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo this, coupled with the [recent] Central Bank of Iran designation under counterterrorism authorities really just adds to the complexity of making these [humanitarian] exports happen,\u201d O\u2019Toole, now a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council, said.", "description": "The US Treasury's new Iran \"humanitarian\" mechanism is seen by experts as a tool to inform new sanctions on the country.", "authors": ["Laura Rozen"], "top_image": "https://9c998969b63acdb676d1-37595348221e1b716e1a6cfee3ed7891.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/almpics/2019/10/RTS1WDE0.jpg/RTS1WDE0-870.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
