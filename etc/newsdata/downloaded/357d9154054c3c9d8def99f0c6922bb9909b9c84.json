That is how fast someone is affected,\u201d his mum said.\n\n\u201cCody is still homeless in Las Vegas and I have not heard from him in weeks now. Hearing how bad he is doing is hard but not hearing at all is worse.\n\nShe explained: \"I am hesitant on sharing but many people ask how things are going so I feel I should share. I have learned along this path that so many people and families deal with the same heartache but just do not talk about it.\n\n\"This is a true issue in our world today that we need to pull together and focus on to fix instead of the government worrying about and spending all their money on throwing each other under the bus.\"\n\nThe Facebook post in which the mum urged \"let's get a hold of this issue America\" has been shared nearly 40,000 times since it was posted two days ago.\n\nA missing persons page said he had previously been reported missing to Las Vegas Police in May after his family reported concerns for his wellbeing.\n\nIt said his family had been unable to trace him after he did a stint in rehab in Nevada.\n\nThe post said he had been living homeless before, and was often with a girl called Kate, and urged anyone who came across him to contact the authorities.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with drug addiction, please visit drugwise.org.uk or addaction.org.uk for advice and support, or contact helpline DrugFAM on 0300 888 3853 9am-5pm Mon - Fri, or visit drugfam.co.uk .", "description": "The Las Vegas mum posted the photos online to show the toll drug addiction can have on a young life", "authors": ["Talia Shadwell", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20557581.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mums-shocking-photos-of-son-taken-months-apart-showing-horrific-toll-of-drug-abuse.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
