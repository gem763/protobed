Plus, two brothers, two media outlets, one family feud in Poland.\n\nOn The Listening Post this week: Even as they face gunfire on the streets, Iraqis have been fighting to put their story out. Plus, two brothers, two media outlets, one family feud in Poland.\n\nIraqi protesters take on the establishment, fight to be heard\n\nIraq's protests started small, but escalated quickly. Social media can have that effect. Then came the security crackdown across the country, including the use of live ammunition.\n\nMore than 100 protesters have been killed, as many as 6,000 wounded and a number of news organisations attacked.\n\nIraqi protesters are demanding an overhaul of the political system and, given the scale of the protests, it is little wonder that politicians, the security forces they control and the media outlets they own are closing ranks to protect the status quo.\n\nContributors:\n\nAida al-Kaisy - senior teaching fellow, SOAS\n\nBilal Wahab - fellow, The Washington Institute\n\nRenad Mansour - research fellow, MENA Programme, Chatham House\n\nAzhar Rubaie - journalist\n\nOn our radar:\n\nRichard Gizbert speaks to producer Meenakshi Ravi about the American comedian who tried to justify her friendship with former US president George W Bush, only to see it backfire online.\n\nA Tale of Two Brothers: Poland, Politics and The Press\n\nThe populist Law and Justice party of Poland is hoping for re-election, and among the tools at its disposal to secure victory is the public broadcaster, Telewizja Polska (TVP).\n\nThe head of TVP, Jacek Kurski, is more than just loyal to the ruling party - he has made sweeping changes, turning the network into a propaganda machine that his political masters now rely on.\n\nBut Jacek is not the only Kurski in the media business in Poland - his older brother, Jaroslaw, effectively runs the country's biggest opposition newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza. Think 'Family Feud', only one with political and media angles.\n\nThe Listening Post's Flo Phillips reports on how the story of these two brothers and the media outlets they run reflects a deeply divided country.\n\nContributors:\n\nJaros\u0142aw Kurski - first deputy editor-in-chief, Gazeta Wyborcza\n\nAgata Szczesniak - journalist, OKO.press\n\nKrzysztof Skowronski - host, TVP and president, Polish Journalists Association\n\nRafal Kalukin - journalist, Polityka\n\nSource: Al Jazeera News", "description": "Iraqi protesters fight to express their dissent.
