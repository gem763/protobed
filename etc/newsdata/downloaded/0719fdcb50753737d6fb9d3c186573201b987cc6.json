Ministry of Public Health spokesman Carlos Suero previously likened the surge of coverage to \"hysteria.\"\n\n\"The worst news for us is when we're informed that one tourist has passed away,\" Garcia said at the press conference on Thursday.\n\nHowever, he said that his country and the resorts at Punta Cana have been treated unfairly in the press, resulting in scaremongering about the safety of visiting the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe press conference did not include allotted time for reporters to ask questions, and the public relations agency working on behalf of the Ministry of Tourism and the Consulate General of the Dominican Republic in New York did not immediately respond to Business Insider's follow-up questions.\n\nOfficials say that the media narrative about tourist deaths in the Dominican Republic has hurt tourism. Tatiana Fernandez/AP Images TravAlliancemedia CEO Mark Murphy, who moderated the event, started off the press conference by criticizing what he called \"ridiculous\" media coverage of tourist deaths in the Dominican Republic. In his opening remarks, he said that news outlets generated \"billions and billions of page views\" on an \"erroneous\" story.\n\nSpeaking through a translator, Garcia opened his speech by comparing the level of media coverage this past summer to the intensity of the Allied bombing of Germany toward the end of World War II. He criticized the US press for the media frenzy that developed over the summer and also proceeded to cast doubt on a number of the most visible stories.\n\nSpecifically, he spoke about Tammy Lawrence-Daly, the American tourist who said she was attacked at the Dominican Republic's Majestic Elegance Resort in January. She is now suing the resort for $3 million.\n\n\"It all started with an American tourist that visited us that had a situation that everybody here knows about and sometime later, in an orchestrated effort, published what she said happened to her on social media,\" Garcia said. \"Now what's the real story?\"\n\nRead more: A Dominican Republic official said an American woman probably died 'from the shock' of seeing her fianc\u00e9 dead. Here's how that's possible.\n\nThe minister said that, starting with that incident, \"a hypothesis developed through the media\" that an \"avalanche\" of \"mysterious deaths\" were occurring in the Dominican Republic.\n\nGarcia said that extensive autopsies of all the tourists who passed away were completed, resulting in universal findings that the deaths came about due to natural causes. He also mentioned the case of Maryland couple Nathaniel Holmes and Cynthia Day, who were found dead of respiratory failure in their room at the Bah\u00eda Pr\u00edncipe hotel. He said that his government immediately invited the FBI in to independently perform their own tests.\n\nThe press release further highlighted the FBI's role in the ongoing investigation into a number of the cases: \"At the request of Dominican authorities, the Federal Bureau of Investigations is conducting toxicology tests in three specific cases to bring clarity to unsubstantiated speculation and perceived similarities. The FBI is acting independently to ensure objectivity and results will be shared at their discretion.\"\n\nGarcia disputed the characterization that the deaths were \"mysterious\" and said that the island has not experienced an abnormally large number of tourist fatalities.\n\nThe minister is not the only one to call into question the narrative that the Dominican Republic has experienced an unusually high number of deaths this year. The US State Department also came out against the idea of an uptick in the fatality rate among US tourists visiting the country.\n\n\"Believe me, if it were alcohol, people would be dropping like flies,\" the US Ambassador to the Dominican Republic said. Tatiana Fernandez/AP Images\n\nThe minister said that the US State Department has assigned the Dominican Republic a safety level of two, as it has with France, Spain, Belgium, and Denmark. Later on during the event, Murphy would remark that certain parts of New York City could be listed as a level 3 or even a level 4 in terms of danger. He did not specify which neighborhoods he was talking about.\n\nGarcia also pointed out the example of Las Vegas, where he said thousands of travelers died over the course of 2018, including 66 cases where the cause of death remains unclear.\n\nIn regards to the media's coverage over the summer, Garcia said that the press frequently got facts wrong when chasing different stories, writing roundups of deaths that included fatalities not involving US tourists or people visiting Punta Cana resorts. The minister said that the press conference came about because he wants \"the truth to come out\" about the tourist deaths.\n\nAccording to Garcia, news coverage from the summer has damaged his country's economy, which relies heavily on tourism.\n\nRead more: A Dominican Republic health official said any tie between the spate of recent tourist deaths is 'fake news'\n\nWhile the press conference focused mostly on disputing the media coverage from over the summer, a statement handed out at the event mentioned specific actions that the country is taking to bolster security for tourists.\n\nMeasures outlined in either the press conference or the press release included \"doubling inspection capacities in tourist destinations throughout the country,\" specifically honing in on resorts' medical and lifeguarding staff; requiring hotels to post information about calling 911 in all guest rooms and provide information about contacting emergency service at check-in; building a \"multi-lingual emergency center\" in B\u00e1varo; and trainings for all tourism industry inspectors using ServSafe, a food and beverage safety training program.\n\nAfter the minister's remarks, Murphy moderated a panel with the hospitality executives, Dominican Republic officials, and Bernstein. Other members of the panel included the VP of Dominican hospitality trade group ASONAHORES Rafael Blanco Tejera, Playa Hotels and Resorts CEO Bruce D. Wardinski, Apple Leisure Group Executive Chairman Alex Zozaya, and Carlos Castillo, the consul general of the Dominican Republic in New York.\n\nThe ambassador said that \"her heart goes out to the families\" who lost loved ones on vacation, but that she knows firsthand that the Dominican Republic is a safe place. She cast doubt upon the theory that some of the deaths were caused by illicit alcohol.\n\n\"Believe me, if it were alcohol, people would be dropping like flies,\" she said.\n\nBernstein also asked the press to cover the issue responsibility, calling the media frenzy from the summer \"an unfounded negative campaign.\" Murphy added that the public relations campaign would also feature the establishment of a website where false stories about the Dominican Republic would be addressed.\n\n\"We're going to call you out with the fake news,\" Murphy said.", "description": "Tourism minister Francisco Javier Garcia said he wants the \"the truth to come out\" regarding the deaths of tourists in the Dominican Republic.", "authors": ["\u00c1ine Cain"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7ac3392e22af0eb87ef1a3-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
