Presented by\n\nRepublican Dan Bishop celebrates his victory in North Carolina's 9th Congressional special election in Monroe, N.C., on Tuesday, Sept. 10. | Nell Redmond/AP Photo\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nGOOD MORNING FROM CHARLOTTE. Millions of Republican dollars and a DONALD TRUMP and MIKE PENCE visit later, the Republicans found a way to hold onto a deep red House seat here in North Carolina, where DAN BISHOP, a Republican state senator, beat DAN MCCREADY, a Democrat who has never held elective office, by 2.08 percentage points, or fewer than 4,000 votes.\n\nTHIS DISTRICT WAS ONCE familiar and comfortable territory for the GOP, and an afterthought electorally. Republicans dominated almost everywhere, from Mercedes-lined, leafy Charlotte streets to rural farm counties. In other words, this is the kind of district that was built for a previous iteration of the GOP.\n\nBUT IN THE TRUMP ERA, it has morphed into a battleground. The wealthy suburbs of Charlotte -- Mecklenburg County -- turned sharply away from TRUMP and the GOP and toward Democrats. And the exurbs and rural parts of the district have become redder, mirroring the reshaping of the Republican electorate, writ large.\n\nTHAT MADE THIS SEAT -- North Carolina\u2019s 9th District -- a hell of a race. Republicans and Democrats spent lavishly, trying to match each other dollar for dollar in a race that attracted nearly $20 million in spending. And in the end, the 12-point margin that MCCREADY -- an Iraq war vet with Duke and Harvard degrees -- built up in Mecklenburg County was not enough to keep BISHOP from wrapping himself in everything TRUMP and keeping the seat in GOP hands. But just barely.\n\nTHERE IS A LOT TO SAY ABOUT REPUBLICANS having to fight out a district that was literally drawn for them to win, but a win is a win. Perhaps most notably, the NRCC and CLF -- which were at war with each other last cycle -- were able to spend money in a complementary fashion and erase McCready\u2019s early lead.\n\nBUT THERE ARE SOME LESSONS LEARNED HERE for the GOP and for Democrats. The Republican Party is becoming more and more of a rural party, anchored far away from the well-educated and middle-to-upper-class city suburbs. The House GOP coalition is a shadow of its 2010-to-2018 self. The party occupies far fewer suburban seats than ever before, having lost them in Dallas, Houston, Orange County, New York, Pennsylvania and elsewhere. They had to fight to keep this one in the suburbs and exurbs of the South, once the building blocks of their majority. More from Steven Shepard, Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez and Alex Isenstadt on the GOP\u2019s fragile 2020 position\n\nIF YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN thinking about running for office in anything resembling a competitive seat, would you take the plunge after seeing Bishop narrowly beat the well-funded McCready in this red seat here?\n\nAND DEMOCRATS would like you to focus on the fact that they shouldn\u2019t have been competing here, and keeping it close is a victory in and of itself. Well, there are no participation trophies in politics. Parties and candidates fight to win. Democrats didn\u2019t raise and spend millions of dollars to keep it close here. They spent that money to win. And they didn\u2019t.\n\nREALITY: The political picture has been pretty stagnant for the GOP since November. Their political coalition is being reshaped by TRUMP, and they are squeaking by in previously comfortable environs. When it comes to control of the House, the question remains: Are there enough winnable seats for Republicans to get to 218?\n\nSCENE \u2026 WE SPENT THE NIGHT at the McCready watch party in Charlotte, which was at the DoubleTree Hotel. After McCready lost, there were chants of \u201cnew maps.\u201d\n\n-- MCCREADY, who came on stage late in the 10 o\u2019clock hour, said this: \u201cOur mission to bring this country together -- this was never a mission that could be accomplished in a single election. We didn\u2019t win this campaign tonight, but there is no doubt in my mind that our efforts over the last 27 months move our country forward.\u201d McCready lost two consecutive elections, the first of which was marred by voter fraud. \u201cVictory postponed is not defeat,\u201d he said.\n\nHMM \u2026 WATCH FOR THE DEEP DIVES \u2026 MCCREADY won rural Robeson County by 15 points last election. He won it by 1 percentage point this time around.\n\nIt\u2019s Wednesday, and TODAY is Sept. 11. The president and first lady Melania Trump will participate in a moment of silence at 8:40 a.m. They will also participate in a Sept. 11 Pentagon observance ceremony at 9:30 a.m. at the National 9/11 Pentagon Memorial.\n\n-- SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI and HOUSE MINORITY LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY will lead a moment of silence on the House East front steps of the Capitol at 8:46 a.m.\n\nA message from Business Roundtable: As leaders of America\u2019s largest companies, Business Roundtable CEOs urge Congress to pass USMCA.

The hard-line group has elected Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) to be the new Freedom Caucus chief, replacing the current chairman, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.). Meadows, a founding Freedom Caucus member and one of President Donald Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill, will step down on Oct. 1 but is expected to remain on the group\u2019s board.\u201d POLITICO\n\nBRYAN BENDER and NATASHA BERTRAND: \u201cSenator seeks independent probe of military\u2019s use of Trump resort\u201d: \u201cThe top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has formally requested an independent investigation into the Air Force\u2019s increased use of a commercial airport in Scotland and overnight stays at the Trump Turnberry resort.\n\n\u201c\u2018I am disturbed by the growing number of those in government willing to engage in questionable taxpayer funded travel to and lodging at properties owned by the president \u2014 properties from which President Trump can draw income at any time,\u2019 Sen.

Mr. Mulvaney accused Mr. Bolton of trying to start a war and veering from Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred path, the people said.\u201d WSJ\n\n-- AP: \u201cInside Bolton\u2019s exit: Mongolia, a mustache, a tweet\u201d: by Jonathan Lemire, Zeke Miller and Deb Riechmann: \u201cTrump does value disagreement and jockeying among his staff. But he came to believe that Bolton\u2019s presence spooked foreign leaders. And he eventually grew weary of the national security adviser\u2019s bureaucratic knife-fighting.\u201d AP\n\n-- ELIANA JOHNSON: \u201cUltimately, it was hearing media accounts about how Bolton had advised the president to scuttle a meeting with Taliban leaders at Camp David that proved a breaking point for Trump \u2026 In the president\u2019s telling, he had taken his own counsel in arriving at the decision to call off the meeting and end the negotiations, and he was infuriated to hear Bolton credited with influencing his decision.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- WAPO\u2019S KAREN DEYOUNG, JOSH DAWSEY and JOHN HUDSON: \u201cAmong accumulated grievances that had been building for months, the president was annoyed that Bolton would regularly call on members of Congress to try to get them to push Bolton-preferred policies on Trump \u2026 Many on Bolton\u2019s handpicked staff were seen as unnecessarily confrontational with other parts of the national security bureaucracy.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- BURGESS EVERETT and ELIANA JOHNSON: \u201cJohn Bolton\u2019s gone \u2014 and Republicans want in\u201d: \u201cJohn Bolton\u2019s ouster from the Trump administration creates an immediate void on President Donald Trump\u2019s national security team as the president weighs critical decisions about the war on Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a vacuum that a number of Senate Republicans are eager to fill. Senators who have been trying to shape President Donald Trump\u2019s thinking on foreign policy \u2014 especially the peace talks in Afghanistan \u2014 are now jockeying for more influence over the president\u2019s thinking. With an interventionist hawk like Bolton out of the picture, Trump, who campaigned on winding down the United States\u2019 engagement overseas, may be more inclined to limit foreign engagements.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- RUSH LIMBAUGH on Bolton\u2019s ouster: \u201cit might have something to do with somebody inviting the Taliban to Camp David. Whoever did that needs to have their head examined. Now, I can\u2019t believe that Bolton would be the guy responsible for that. \u2026 He doesn\u2019t suffer fools, and he\u2019s not somebody that likes to accommodate the enemy. Whoever it was that came up with the idea of having these Taliban monsters up at Camp David, thank goodness that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Mediaite\n\n-- FWIW, THE SHORT LIST \u2026 NYT\u2019S KATIE ROGERS ET AL: \u201cWho Could Replace John Bolton?\u201d: Fred Fleitz, Keith Kellogg, Jack Keane, Robert Blair, Robert C. O\u2019Brien, Charles M. Kupperman, Stephen E. Biegun, Brian H. Hook, Douglas Macgregor, Richard Grenell, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster (!), Ricky Waddell\n\n-- BLOOMBERG\u2019S NICK WADHAMS: \u201cPompeo Is \u2018Last Man Standing\u2019 After Bolton Departs White House\u201d: \u201cPompeo is now without peer on Trump\u2019s national security team. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper is weeks into his job, there\u2019s no confirmed director of national intelligence and United Nations Ambassador Kelly Craft was confirmed on Tuesday. Among the president\u2019s advisers, Pompeo will have the biggest sway on decisions about brokering a deal with Iran, restarting talks with North Korea and finding a way to draw down forces in Afghanistan.\u201d Bloomberg\n\nTHE NEXT THING \u2026 WAPO: \u201cTrump pushing for major crackdown on homeless camps in California, with aides discussing moving residents to government-backed facilities,\u201d by Jeff Stein, Tracy Jan, Josh Dawsey and Ashley Parker: \u201cPresident Trump has ordered White House officials to launch a sweeping effort to address homelessness in California, citing the state\u2019s growing crisis, according to four government officials aware of the effort.\n\n\u201cThe planning has intensified in recent weeks. Administration officials have discussed using the federal government to get homeless people off the streets of Los Angeles and other cities and into new government-backed facilities, according to two officials briefed on the planning.\n\n\u201cBut it is unclear how they could accomplish this and what legal authority they would use. It is also unclear whether the state\u2019s Democratic politicians would cooperate with Trump, who has sought to embarrass them over the homelessness crisis with repeated attacks on their competency.\u201d WaPo\n\nA message from Business Roundtable: USMCA should be a top priority for Members of Congress to support the millions of Americans who depend on trade with Canada and Mexico.\n\n2020 WATCH \u2026 RYAN LIZZA ON TEAM BIDEN VS. THE PRESS: \u201cThe first thing you notice at a Joe Biden event is the age: Many of the reporters covering him are really young. Biden is not. The press corps, or so the Biden campaign sees it, is culturally liberal and highly attuned to modern issues around race and gender and social justice. Biden is not. The reporters are Extremely Online. Biden couldn\u2019t tell you what TikTok is.\n\n\u201cInside the Biden campaign, it is the collision between these two worlds that advisers believe explain why his White House run often looks like a months-long series of gaffes. For a team in command of the Democratic primary, at least for now, they\u2019re awfully resentful of how their man is being covered. And yet supremely confident that they, not the woke press that pounces on Biden\u2019s every seeming error and blight in his record, has a vastly superior understanding of the Democratic electorate. This is the central paradox of Biden\u2019s run: He\u2019s been amazingly durable. But he gets no respect from the people who make conventional wisdom on the left.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- NEW POLL \u2026 \u201cElizabeth Warren is on the rise among Democratic voters, but she and other Democrats are less popular with the overall electorate, raising concerns about a bruising primary that could go on for the better part of the next year, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. The survey also finds President Trump continuing to struggle, with economic concerns seemingly starting to affect his standing, leaving a cloudy picture about the 2020 presidential election.\u201d NPR\n\n-- THE GOP PRIMARY \u2026 \u201cStill on: Iowa, New Hampshire won\u2019t nix 2020 GOP contests,\u201d by AP\u2019s Steve Peoples, Hunter Woodall and Meg Kinnard with a Manchester, N.H., dateline\n\n-- BUSINESS INSIDER will host a GOP presidential primary debate Sept. 24 with Joe Walsh and Bill Weld.
