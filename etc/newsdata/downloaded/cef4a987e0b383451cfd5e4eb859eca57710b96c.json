Braemar estimates another 23 VLCCs are also out of service to install emissions cleaning equipment to meet stricter global marine fuel rules from January 2020.\n\nCOSCO oil tankers idled at sea or switched off their ship\n\ntrackers here\n\nVLCC freight rates for key crude oil supply routes to Asia have surged since the U.S. ratcheted up sanctions in recent months.\n\nThe Singapore Petroleum Co, wholly owned by PetroChina, has provisionally chartered VLCC Houston to load crude in the Middle East for China in early November at 205 Worldscale points, in what could be the highest rate so far in the market, a trade source who tracks the market closely said on Friday.\n\nThe rate was at W67 prior to sanctions, according to a shipbroker. DFRT-ME-CN\n\nVLCC rates for U.S. Gulf to Asia TD-LPP-SIN, the longest crude oil shipping route globally, hit a new high of $14 million this week, raising costs for oil buyers in Asia.\n\nSupertanker freight rates to Asia jump on U.S. sanctions here", "description": "Nearly 300 oil tankers globally have been placed off limits as companies fear violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela, driving freight rates to new highs, industry sources said.", "authors": ["Marianna Parraga", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
