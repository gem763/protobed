Great Britain fall short\n\nThis was supposed to be the triumphant return of the Lions after a 12-year absence. But although they stood toe-to-toe with a Tongan side packed with leading NRL talent, their execution and cutting edge was miles off when it mattered most.\n\nKristian Woolf\u2019s team took the game to the tourists from the moment they recovered from booting the initial kick-off out on the full, with their superstar pack getting the better of Wayne Bennett\u2019s men.\n\n(Image: Jeremy Ward / www.photosport.nz /SWpix.com)\n\nTheir two first half tries came from kicks - but were fully deserved after dominating the Lions. And although John Bateman\u2019s 69th minute try gave Great Britain brief hope, they had left themselves too much to do.\n\nBennett\u2019s wounded side must now regroup quickly with two tests against New Zealand and one in Papua New Guinea to come.\n\n2. Terrific Tonga\n\nKristian Woolf\u2019s team were one of the stories of the 2017 World Cup after beating New Zealand and almost stunning England in the semi-finals - and this was another major high for them.\n\nLed from the front by North Queensland Cowboys back rower Jason Taumalolo and with a lively and safe performance from late call-up Tesi Niu at full-back, they were fully deserving winners. Their forwards - and backs - bashed their British opponents throughout a full-blown test match.\n\nThe crowd might not have been at the level of that memorable Auckland semi-final but the passion of the Tongan supporters was again clear, with hymns audibly ringing out during the game. They remain a source of rich potential for rugby league on the international stage.\n\n(Image: SWpix)\n\n3. Thompson body blow\n\nAfter his Harry Sunderland Trophy-winning performance in the Super League Grand Final, Luke Thompson was hailed as \u201cthe best prop in the world\u201d by team-mate Alex Walmsley.\n\nGiven Thompson made 188 metres from 27 carries and completed 42 tackles, there wasn\u2019t many arguments, at least not from the northern hemisphere.\n\nAs such, the prospect of seeing him go up against Tonga\u2019s mighty pack for the Lions was a mouth-watering one. But Thompson was forced out of the action after less than 12 minutes, apparently with a rib injury, providing a major blow to Great Britain\u2019s forward options.\n\nNot only did they lose his considerable impact, but also a key interchange, which shouldn\u2019t be underestimated.\n\n4. Further injury issues\n\nThere were plenty lining up to criticise Wayne Bennett\u2019s selection of six half-backs and minimal outside backs in his Lions squad - and that decision could now be fully exposed.\n\nOliver Gildart was the only specialist centre named and was forced off after an hour with what looks like a shoulder injury. Hull utility Jake Connor will be next in line, but given Great Britain only have two wingers - Ryan Hall and Jermaine McGillvary - and Zak Hardaker was filling in at right centre, Bennett\u2019s options are now limited.\n\nAny further injuries could lead to back rowers like John Bateman or Elliott Whitehead back out wide again from the start.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n5. Same off-field frustrations\n\nGiven this was Great Britain\u2019s first match since 2007, and Tonga is the sport\u2019s great hope for the future after the huge impact of their World Cup campaign, this occasion should have been a roaring success.\n\nYet in typical rugby league style, politics and in-fighting reared its head in the build-up.\n\nThe tour dates and venues were only confirmed earlier this year - an unthinkable scenario in other leading sports - in a scaled-down itinerary to initial plans. This game was also pitted in direct competition to the long-scheduled Rugby Union World Cup semi-final between England and New Zealand, which was always going to affect television ratings.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBut even more tellingly, rugby league in Tonga then appeared to do its best to implode ahead of the match, with a major dispute between warring factions in the governing body at one point putting the game at doubt. Then there was the prospect of it being a second string Tongan side as the power struggle played out and popular coach Kristian Woolf was replaced, only for the issue to reach some kind of resolution and Woolf and his star players return.\n\nStill, the official title of the team was a Tonga Invitational XIII, and talk before the game was of supporters being urged by some not to attend. So the unforgettable scenes of Auckland 2017 weren\u2019t replicated, although the passion of those inside the ground in a 9,420 Hamilton attendance was again clear.\n\nIf rugby league is ever to reach its potential internationally - and Tonga have shown everybody what is possible - then the off-field wrangles and lack of long-term planning needs to stop.", "description": "First half tries to Michael Jennings and Sione Katoa see Wayne Bennett\u2019s tourists fall short", "authors": ["Gareth Walker", "Image", "Swpix", "Jeremy Ward", "Www.Photosport.Nz", "Swpix.Com", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728454.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_191026LionsvTongaJC3967_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
