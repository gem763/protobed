Since at least 2013, Martha Stewart has been dissing Gwyneth Paltrow, with low-key shade and petty barbs, mostly due to Paltrow cementing her role as a leader in the lifestyle industry, which, as we all know, has always been Stewart\u2019s realm.\n\nAs E! reports, Stewart appeared on a recent episode of Alex Rodriguez\u2019s podcast, The Corp. Interestingly, after talking about \u201chaters,\u201d Stewart was asked what she thought about Goop. \u201cHow would you describe what Gwyneth Paltrow is doing today versus what Martha Stewart created years ago?\u201d she was asked. \u201cI don\u2019t follow Goop,\u201d she replied. \u201cSometimes I look at products that she\u2019s selling \u2026 I wish every young entrepreneur well and I hope that there are many, many, many different kinds of entrepreneurs \u2026 if they\u2019re movie stars or hardworking women like I am, who are not movie stars. If they have a good idea, I want them to be able to succeed. So, good luck, Gwyneth.\u201d So, good luck, Gwyneth. We can taste the salt from here.\n\nWe imagine Stewart at home, scrolling through the Goop website, tightly gripping a tissue until her fingers bleed, like Goldie Hawn in Death Becomes Her. The thing is, Stewart may have more in common with Paltrow than she thinks. At least when it comes to them both not knowing or remembering anyone. The Goop lifestyle empire may be worth over $250 million, but Martha Stewart isn\u2019t buying any of those damn jade eggs.", "description": "During an episode of Alex Rodriguez\u2019s The Corp podcast, Martha Stewart appeared to still have distaste for Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop brand.
