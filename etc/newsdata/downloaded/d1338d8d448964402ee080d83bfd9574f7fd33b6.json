I appealed to the International Community to support the process.\u201d\n\nThe roadmap includes a cessation of hostilities agreement, which both parties have repeatedly broken in the past. The parties agreed on Monday to resume talks after a two-week break.\n\nAn end to multiple conflicts in Sudan is a prerequisite for the United States to remove the country from its list of sponsors of terrorism.\n\nSudan is being led by a transitional government after a coup in April overthrew longtime autocrat Omar al Bashir after months of deadly protests.\n\nThe agreement to open humanitarian access is something that Bashir\u2019s government refused to do for eight years, Arman said.\n\n\u201cWe believe we have a partner in Khartoum and there\u2019s a new environment created by the revolution,\u201d he added.\n\nThe new government in Khartoum is anxious to make peace. The government is cash-strapped and in need of debt relief and financing from multilateral lenders, but its designation as a state sponsor of terrorism has cut it off from such support.", "description": "Sudan has agreed to open humanitarian access to war-torn areas of the country for the first time in eight years as part of a new roadmap enabling suspended peace talks to resume, a rebel leader said on Monday.", "authors": ["Denis Dumo", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443318347&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0QN-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
