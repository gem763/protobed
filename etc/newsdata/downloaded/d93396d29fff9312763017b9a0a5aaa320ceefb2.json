This would all undermine U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nVindman, who arrived in the United States as a 3-year-old from the former Soviet Union, served in various military and diplomatic posts before joining the NSC. He was the director for European affairs and a Ukraine expert under Fiona Hill, a former official who testified earlier in the impeachment probe. Hill worked for former national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nVindman will be a key witness. He attended Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration with a delegation led by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and he was part of Ukraine briefings that irritated Bolton at the White House.\n\nHe will testify that he is not the whistleblower, the still unnamed government official who filed the initial complaint over Trump\u2019s conversation with the Ukraine president that sparked the House impeachment inquiry. He will say he does not know who the whistleblower is.\n\n\u201cI am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics,\u201d Vindman wrote.\n\n\u201cFor over twenty years as an active duty United States military officer and diplomat, I have served this country in a nonpartisan manner, and have done so with the utmost respect and professionalism for both Republican and Democratic administrations,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe testimony is expected the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House will vote on a resolution to affirm the impeachment investigation, set rules for public hearings and outline the potential process for writing articles of impeachment against Trump. The vote is expected Thursday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A 20-year military officer will testify in the House impeachment inquiry that he twice raised concerns over the Trump administration's interest in having Ukraine investigate Joe Biden.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/28/trump_99161_c0-228-5472-3420_s1200x700.jpg?f89739662670662341638fe34403095f75f3e118", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
