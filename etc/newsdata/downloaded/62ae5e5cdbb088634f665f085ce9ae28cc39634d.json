It booked a net loss of $549 million in the second quarter, compared with a $170 million profit in the same quarter a year earlier. Arrow cited lower demand across all component products, all regions and most industries in an earnings release in early August.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want a sustained impact on operating income and earnings per share,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Chris Stansbury said Tuesday in an interview. \u201cBarring the dampening effects on demand from tariffs and trade wars, Arrow would have expected operating income to be up year over year,\u201d Mr. Stansbury said.\n\nArrow plans to take out $130 million in costs by the end of the year and its new enterprise resource planning system is expected to play a key role in achieving that target, Mr. Stansbury said.\n\nThe company\u2019s ERP system ties together a range of business processes in a common data, or network, structure. ERP systems combine information on finance, inventory management, supply chain management and human resource management.\n\nArrow now operates three versions of the same ERP program in three business regions, the Americas, Europe and Asia. The integration of previously separate systems into the three they have now allows the CFO to take a more global look at the company\u2019s operations, Mr. Stansbury said.\n\nThe company is focusing on back-office functions such as finance and human resources alongside warehousing and operations to bring down its costs, Mr. Stansbury said. It will also wind down its personal computer and mobility asset disposition business, a repair and recycling unit. Engineering and front-line sales staff won\u2019t see cuts, Mr. Stansbury said.\n\n\u201cThe ERP has allowed us to do all these cost cuts,\u201d Mr. Stansbury said. \u201cWe would not have been able to do them without it.\u201d\n\nAnalysts expect much of the savings to come from job cuts.\n\n\u201cTheir biggest cost is people,\u201d said Shawn Harrison, a vice president at Longbow Research LLC. \u201cThe one area where they are not cutting back is their engineering and design teams.\u201d\n\nThe company employed about 20,100 people as of Dec. 31, according to Arrow\u2019s annual report.\n\nThe new ERP system will help the company during the current phase of economic uncertainty, Mr. Harrison said. Arrow gets better visibility of its accounts receivables and of its accounts payables thanks to the software, he said.\n\nThe system might also boost efficiency across departments, reducing the potential need for additional cuts in a year or two, said Steven Fox, a managing director at Cross Research LLC.\n\n\u201cIf there are secondary economic effects, we obviously have to go at it again,\u201d Mr. Stansbury said. He added the current cost savings actions wouldn\u2019t be sufficient to fully offset the company\u2019s lost profits.\n\nTrade tensions between the U.S. and China hurt Arrow\u2019s customers, Mr. Stansbury said. \u201cI don\u2019t think tariffs will go away,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit is a moving target.\u201d\n\nArrow passes along the cost of tariffs to its customers in the form of higher prices, Mr. Stansbury said. \u201cThe pain from tariffs comes in the form of lower demand, leading to lower sales, leading to lower ability to drive profits over our fixed expense base,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company has about 200,000 customers world-wide, many of them small- and medium-size industrial companies. \u201cWhat they see in their business is a direct read of manufacturing trends globally,\u201d Longbow\u2019s Mr. Harrison said.\n\nU.S. factory activity contracted for the first time in three years in August. New factory orders, employment and production all declined last month from July, according to manufacturing figures released Tuesday by the Institute for Supply Management.\n\n\u2014Mark Maurer contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "Arrow Electronics, which sells to small and medium-size industrial businesses around the globe, plans to cut $130 million in costs by the end of the year.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103684/social"}
