President trump says he's authorized the release of the transcript of that call with the president of Ukraine. Let's bring in our chief justice correspondent Pierre Thomas in Washington. The release could come at any moment now? Reporter: Good morning. We could see it soon with the transcript being released as early as today. The president tweeted yesterday he had authorized the full release of the transcripts after declassifying the material. So president trump continues to maintain that he did nothing wrong. Basically nothing but if he truly suggested to the president of Ukraine that he should investigate his political rival Joe Biden and/or his son, it looks like we get and the today. What do we know about the whistle-blower? Reporter: We still don't know the identity of this person but we learned overnight the whistle-blower is an official in the intelligence community and we now know that the whistle-blower wants to meet with the house intelligence committee but matters are complicated because the acting director of national intelligence and justice department blocked the whistle-blower's complaint from being shared with congress. But the politics changed dramatically overnight as Mary said when all those 100 senators voting to stay to the administration, give congress the darned complaint. And we're getting indications that the white house is contemplating sharing the complaint possibly as early as this week but, robin, it's a very fluid situation because the intelligence community, inspector general found that the whistle-blower's allegations were credible and of urgent concern. The acting director of national intelligence in the hot seat. Reporter: That's right. He's due -- Joseph Maguire is due to appear on the hill in an open hearing tomorrow and as grillings go on capitol hill this could be white hot. They want that whistle-blower complaint and want to know why they were initially blocked from getting it in the first place? Thank you.
