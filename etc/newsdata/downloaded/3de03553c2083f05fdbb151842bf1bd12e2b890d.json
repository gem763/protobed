But rest assured, Blake Lively was part of his day after he finished the junket, and he'd like you to know it. Reynolds posted a selfie of the two having dinner at New York City's fancy Tak Room restaurant on his Instagram Story, as proof the date did happen.\n\nView photos Photo credit: Instagram More\n\nLively reposted the selfie, which jewelry brand Marla Aaron also shared since she was wearing the line. \"Blake, we love you,\" the brand wrote, and she replied, \"Right back at you @marlaaaron.\"\n\nView photos Photo credit: Instagram More\n\nThis look into their relationship is pretty rare, along with the Blake Lively sighting period and the fact Reynolds didn't have any trolling in his post. He usually pokes fun at Lively in his social media posts about her.\n\nReynolds last trolled Lively when he posted unflattering photos of her for her Instagram birthday tribute.\n\nAnd Lively last made fun of Reynolds when she shared a screenshot featuring photos of the two on her Photo app in September. \"It's like my iPhone captured everything you need to know about my relationship in 2 simple images...\" she wrote, with photos of Reynolds in a chicken cap and her looking unamused featured.\n\nView photos Photo credit: Instagram More\n\nLively has spent most of the year off social media and out of the public eye. She announced she was expecting her and Reynolds' third child in May, although no exact due date was reported. Lively and Reynolds are already parents to their two daughters James and Inez.\n\nLively last made headlines for her Emmys night post, when she shared a throwback image for her and Leighton Meester presenting at the 2009 Emmys. It was a call back to their Gossip Girl days\u2014and it came shortly after a reboot of the show with a new young cast was announced for HBO Max.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "How else would the world find out?", "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DPOC.cRG__tHOxgMRc3qAQ--~B/aD0xMTIyO3c9MjIzNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/cc4f034f571f4caabe7904d086ed682b", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
