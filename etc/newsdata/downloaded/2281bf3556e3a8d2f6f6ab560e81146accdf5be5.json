This starts spiralling and the calls become more and more angry.\n\n\u2018I understand that this does not make the threats any less serious, but it\u2019s more down to the break down in the relationship rather than witness intimidation.\u2019\n\nMr Bourne-Arton also said drugs, particularly crack cocaine, had been the cause of most Blagg\u2019s run-ins with the law, but said he had a \u2018good attitude to work\u2019.\n\nBlagg had admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and pleaded guilty to a charge of witness intimidation ahead of a trial.\n\nJailing him for 22 months, judge Howard Crowson said: \u2018She had been your victim before and you knew she was pregnant. You were kicking her with your shoes on.\n\n\u2018Her injuries were not as great as they may necessarily have been, otherwise your sentence could have been longer.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
