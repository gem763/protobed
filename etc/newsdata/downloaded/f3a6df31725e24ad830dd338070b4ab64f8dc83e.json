Photo: Jason Kempin/Getty Images for for Essential Broadcast Media\n\nA debate has been raging in Nashville for the better part of this decade over what should be done about the dearth of female hit-makers on country radio and the corresponding lack of opportunities for women to build marquee careers in the format. Those with a stake in maintaining the status quo have argued that it\u2019s simply a matter of objective market forces at work \u2014 a viewpoint expressed most provocatively by a radio consultant who advised programmers to sprinkle women sparingly onto playlists like a garnish on a salad. Artists across generations as well as industry vets have addressed the gross imbalance by organizing showcases, promotional campaigns, tours, and festivals around women; highlighting female capability in songs; or trying to circumvent the system altogether. The Highwomen, the new country supergroup comprised of Amanda Shires, Maren Morris, Natalie Hemby, and Brandi Carlile, are not only aware of those efforts but responsible for a few of them, and they share an interest in illustrating how women\u2019s efforts to get their voices heard in country music are connected to a broader cultural moment.\n\nShires, the band\u2019s unlikely instigator, has earned recognition for her fiddling virtuosity and cutting poeticism in folk-country, singer-songwriter, and roots-rock circles while observing the country mainstream from a safe yet concerned distance. But she started taking the gender disparity personally when she and her husband and fellow artist Jason Isbell\u2019s four-year-old daughter began showing musical proclivities. \u201cTo me,\u201d Shires says, \u201cthe worst that could happen is that she would gravitate towards country as it is now. My fear is that it\u2019s supercompetitive and there haven\u2019t been enough spots for women. I want it to be easier for her, and then at the same time I want it to be easier for other people.\u201d\n\nWith the help of producer Dave Cobb, Shires recruited Carlile \u2014 who has lately achieved new levels of popular recognition as an acoustic anthem-belting folk-rock heroine \u2014 to the Highwomen cause, then Morris, the confidently sensual, savvily genre-bending country-pop force who\u2019s labored for her place on the charts. After Hemby, who has written defining songs with and for country\u2019s leading women (and many of their male counterparts) but has only recently stepped out front herself, submitted material for the group\u2019s self-titled debut album, she got pulled in too. \u201cI felt like I got asked to prom by the most popular kids at school,\u201d she quips.\n\nUniting their disparate vantage points and sensibilities, the four spread the singing and songwriting contributions around and made symbolic use of unison vocalizing on Highwomen. Sometimes they\u2019re side by side in their salty exasperation at the emotional labor expected of their gender. At other moments, they arrange their voices in sympathetic, full-bodied harmony. Their hooks are heartily direct, and their accompaniment has the windswept expansiveness of outlaw-era country rock and singer-songwriter balladry, along with the earthen wit of throwback honky-tonk \u2014 all of which would make it sound rootsy by contemporary standards, if not for its California soft-rock burnish.\n\nBelieve it or not, the group\u2019s name isn\u2019t a stoner reference. It\u2019s a gender-flipped version of the title a foursome of male country legends \u2014 Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson \u2014 claimed for their own 1980s supergroup. Though their commercial heydays were already in the rearview by the time they made the Highwaymen albums, those projects augmented their virile, battle-scarred gravitas and larger-than-life stature. The Highwomen went so far as to refashion the elder band\u2019s mythologizing theme song, replacing its male protagonists with women who died living epic lives and inviting the ascendant black British country-soul artist Yola to deliver a verse about a civil-rights Freedom Rider.\n\nCarlile, Hemby, Morris, and Shires are claiming their place in the Highwaymen\u2019s lineage of heroic lore and in country music\u2019s rich tradition of female supergroups \u2014 from Trio, whose Dolly Parton recently joined the Highwomen for a Newport Folk Festival performance, to Pistol Annies, whose Miranda Lambert has a co-writing credit on Highwomen. The quartet has also emerged on the heels of a parallel talent-pooling of women\u2019s efforts in the indie-rock (boygenius) and string-band scenes (I\u2019m With Her and Our Native Daughters, the latter a truly groundbreaking reclamation of historical black ingenuity convened by Rhiannon Giddens). For Hemby and Shires, who spoke to Vulture by phone ahead of the group\u2019s album release, the Highwomen strike a celebratory posture toward women revising dominant narratives in music and beyond.\n\nThe Highwomen have a different origin story than most supergroups because you\u2019d had individual success and mostly didn\u2019t know each other. What was it like building a band around mutual respect and a sense of genre activism?\n\n\ufeffNatalie Hemby: When I joined the band, I didn\u2019t really go, \u201cI want to be part of the women\u2019s movement.\u201d I was more intrigued by the music, by the honesty of it all, and by the three of them as artists. Our intention is to try to hold open doors. But, damn, it\u2019s also really great to make fun, great music with people who you really respect.\n\nAmanda Shires: Genre activism is important because in the lanes that I operate in, it\u2019s already a lot more even. But it\u2019s like this one particular genre, in the grand scheme of things, has been a little lopsided, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any shame in saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019re still here, guys.\u201d\n\nMaybe we don\u2019t have radio on our side. Maybe we do. But we\u2019re here, and you\u2019re going to have to listen to us.\n\nAmanda, when you started describing this idea in interviews, all of the names you floated as potential bandmates \u2014 Brandi Carlile and Margo Price \u2014 were on the independent side of things and insulated from the impact of country radio. But you ended up with a Highwomen lineup that includes people who occupy a variety of different lanes, from the Americana scene to the country mainstream. Why does that matter?\n\n\ufeffAS: I did talk to several people about this project \u2014 Jenny Lewis, Gillian Welch, Margo. They were like, \u201cI want to participate however I can. I\u2019ll be a Highwoman, but I have scheduling conflicts.\u201d I never wanted it to be a thing where it was only four people onstage at once. I want it to be where if a bunch of awesome musicians came up to our show and wanted to sing with us, they\u2019re Highwomen too, just like Sheryl Crow, just like Yola. But I think the four core Highwomen are able to bring more awareness because we operate in different fields. It makes the conversation bigger and louder.\n\nNH: It\u2019s like we\u2019re coming from all four corners of the music universe. All four are so different, but our voices coming together, it\u2019s a statement.\n\nAS: And it\u2019s not limited to women, either. My husband has a Highwomen tattoo, and so does our guitar tech.\n\nWhat makes solidarity a particularly forceful tool?\n\n\ufeffNH: Doing these things together is always more fun than trying to go out there and fight some mission on your own.\n\nAS: It encourages other people to form their own groups within their own communities. It\u2019s also important in these times when they feel so dark and you feel so alone to have more people on your side. It\u2019s more like a party then too. And if somebody tries to rush the stage and get my fiddle, I\u2019m pretty sure all three of these girls will put them off.\n\nWould it be accurate to say the Highwomen have no lead singer?\n\n\ufeffAS: Yes. Every one of us is the lead singer.\n\nNH: We [every member] are the lead singer. We all have a place in this, and we all just gravitate toward the parts we usually sing.\n\nAS: That\u2019s the most magical thing I can think of with the whole project. No parts were assigned. We all just know our voices and where they sit, and then we also know how to be kind and respect one another and say, \u201cHey, do you guys like what I\u2019m doing?\u201d It was never a problem. Of all the stories I\u2019ve ever heard in the studio, I\u2019ve never heard of that.\n\nIn the name, narrative, and theme song of the group, you\u2019re invoking the Highwaymen. What are you getting at with that gender-flipped reference?\n\n\ufeffNH: They all were kind of dark horses. They didn\u2019t play by anyone\u2019s rules. And between me, Brandi, Maren, and Amanda, we don\u2019t play by rules necessarily either.\n\nAS: We listen to the rules, and if we like the rules, we follow them. And if they\u2019re unfair, we just say, \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, and we\u2019re making a new rule going forward.\u201d\n\nNH: I\u2019m 42-years-old, and I\u2019m just now joining a band. That is not something that someone would be like, \u201cWow, this is a really great idea.\u201d The Highwaymen had a brilliant, rebellious nature to them. And they stood up [against] some social injustices. We also want to see things change.\n\nYou\u2019ve each released at least one solo album comprised entirely of songs you wrote, but it seems like the Highwomen mind-set was different: that it didn\u2019t really matter where the material came from as long as the message fit the group.\n\n\ufeffAS: The intention of the project is inclusivity, and you can\u2019t be inclusive if you\u2019re excluding songs for any base reason. It didn\u2019t really matter where they came from as long as the message and the intention and the spirit of them were clear. What I want for us is to sing our stories and show all of our versions of ourselves, all of our faces.\n\nNH: Part of it was about raising children. Part of it was \u201cI don\u2019t feel like being a mama today.\u201d Part of it was \u201cHey, you\u2019re my sister. Let\u2019s sit at this table together.\u201d And then another part of it was \u201cOh my God, I don\u2019t know how we [women] do it.\u201d And then we have a beautiful gay country song.\n\nBrandi brings considerable swagger to that song, \u201cIf She Ever Leaves Me,\u201d telling a would-be player that he has no chance with her woman. On a deeper level, it also feels like a plainspoken rebuke to anyone who thinks country music isn\u2019t for queer people and perspectives, and it\u2019s likely to be heard more widely than other songs that have made that point.\n\n\ufeffAS: We wrote that with Brandi in mind. These kinds of songs are important, because I don\u2019t know about y\u2019all, but I\u2019ve got gay folks in my family. I\u2019ve got transgender folks in my family. I\u2019ve got all kinds of family. And I think country music isn\u2019t for a certain type. It\u2019s more than that, and it\u2019s been more than that in the past. And I\u2019d like to see a broader representation of people within that genre.\n\nYour song \u201cCrowded Table\u201d articulates a desire to make room. It\u2019s pretty much the antithesis of the perception that women see themselves in competition for limited spots. Tell me about using a domestic metaphor \u2014 a dining-room table \u2014 to talk about the changes you\u2019d like to see in your professional worlds.\n\n\ufeffNH: I\u2019m not a competitive person. I am a come-sit-at-my-table person.\n\nAS: People can apply it to any sort of table. My family is heavily divided right now with politics, for example. For me, it\u2019s about how we can still believe what we believe, but we should still be able to sit down and have some sort of discourse.\n\nYou see this as a movement?\n\n\ufeffAS: We need more women engineers, more women producers, but there are a lot of women in other fields, like journalism and the medical field and construction. There\u2019s all kinds of Highwomen out there, and it\u2019s supposed to be applicable for all the folks that are out there doing it. Even for the stay-at-home mothers \u2014 that\u2019s more than a 40-hours-a-week job. It\u2019s not only a thing we\u2019re trying to do, it\u2019s also a thing we\u2019re trying to get a little bit more comfortable in. Just [receiving] acknowledgement sometimes helps.\n\nThere\u2019s been so much talk about how women\u2019s songs are like the tomatoes on the salad. Fuck that. I want a caprese salad.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about wanting to engage the mainstream, even the radio format, with what you\u2019re doing. How did that intention shape the album you\u2019ve made and what you\u2019re trying to do with it?\n\n\ufeffNH: I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re gonna crash through the doors of country radio. If anything, I just love the fact that we made a country record that some young girl who is probably signed to Sony or wherever is going to hear and go, \u201cWow, I want to write a record that\u2019s honest like that.\u201d Maybe we don\u2019t have radio on our side. Maybe we do. But we\u2019re here, and you\u2019re going to have to listen to us.\n\nAS: No matter what happens, it\u2019s not gonna fail because the four of us are in a room together doing this thing. It\u2019s already a win. There\u2019s been so much of this talk about how women\u2019s songs are like the tomatoes on the salad. And I\u2019m like, \u201cFuck that.\u201d I want a caprese salad. Give me a tomato salad.\n\nThere are so many men in the industry that already want this to happen for everybody, for us, for other women, that have been behind it, writing songs with women, taking women on tour, etc. It\u2019s just that the tier above, the old-ass administrators up there, are used to pushing the money button, and they\u2019re scared to try the other thing. It would suck to just write off all the good folks like Dierks [Bentley] and Blake Shelton and Brothers Osborne, Florida Georgia Line, Zac Brown, Jason Isbell, so many that help and speak out along the way. We\u2019re all in it together, for real. It\u2019s just a matter of convincing the hierarchy, or bringing awareness to them as they play golf, that we\u2019re just as good, if not better.
