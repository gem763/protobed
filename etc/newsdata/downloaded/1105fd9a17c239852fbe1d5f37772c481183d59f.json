It also warned the increase in its capital ratio in 2019 would be below its 170-200 basis points per annum guidance.\n\nThe lender made a PPI provision in its second quarter of 650 million pounds.\n\nLloyds had been expected to make a further provision following its rivals' moves, with analysts at KBW saying they had downgraded the bank last week partly due to the expected charge. KBW said the top end of the charge at 1.8 billion was marginally better than its worse case scenario.\n\nLloyds was given some breathing space on capital in May, when regulators reduced its required core capital ratio to 12.5% from 13%, equating to around 1 billion pounds.\n\nLloyds is continuing to target paying a dividend and said it would make a decision on surplus capital at the end of the year.\n\n(The story corrects claim numbers to per week in paragraph seven.)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Carolyn Cohn and Iain Withers; Editing by Rachel Armstrong and Mark Potter)", "description": "Lloyds Banking Group  will set aside up to an extra 1.8 billion pounds ($2.2 billion) to settle mis-selling claims in Britain's costliest consumer banking scandal, and said it was suspending its 2019 share buyback program.
