Facebook didn\u2019t specify if users would be able to charge others to hop into a Telepod to visit their custom worlds, but you can assume that down the road the company will find a way to monetise the experience as the number of worlds and games eventually grows.\n\nWhile the project sounds ambitious and there\u2019s no telling whether the public will see this as a killer app or just another VR project to ignore, one thing is certain: The Horizon avatars have no legs and that\u2019s just weird.\n\nScreenshot: Oculus\n\nHorizon will launch sometime in 2020, and users with Oculus Quest or Oculus Rift hardware can request early access to the beta here. Everyone else will have to wait until sometime next year, but it seems like Facebook is eventually pushing all of its Oculus users to Horizon as come October 26 both the Facebook Space and Oculus Rooms VR social networks are being shut down.", "description": "Today at Oculus Connect 6, Facebook\u2019s annual event that does its best to convince the world why VR is still a thing, the company announced Horizon, a giant virtual reality playground where users can build their own worlds, create and play games, or just socialise with friends who are represented by legless animated...", "authors": ["Catie Keck", "Matt Novak"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/mhpdy451loghpczmmjww.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
