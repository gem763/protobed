The campaign, which includes both transgender and plus-size models, featured May Sim\u00f3n Lifschitz, 24, a biological man who identifies as a woman, in its store window displays.\n\nA model and actor who began taking anti-testosterone hormones at the age of 16, Lifschitz reportedly said changing his body to appear as a woman allowed the ability to \u201cmove through spaces and be acknowledged as a feminine creature, acknowledged for the psyche that comes with being on that side on the spectrum.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will never be 100 per cent happy with my body, like any other woman,\u201d Lifschitz added. \u201cBut I choose to remind myself that I don\u2019t need to \u2018fix\u2019 myself constantly in order to reach that sense of love towards myself.\u201d\n\nBluebella is highlighting its #LoveYourselfCampaign that the brand says seeks to celebrate female empowerment. In the past, both Victoria\u2019s Secret and Bluebella have been the recipients of condemnation from the left for their lack of \u201cdiversity.\u201d\n\nLifschitz is modeling the brand\u2019s Autumn/Winter 2019 collection along with plus-size model Ali Tate Cutler.\n\nAccording to Bluebella, Lifschitz \u201cis one of the four gorgeous women featured in our LoveYourself campaign, all about self-love.\u201d\n\nLifschitz \u201cdescribes her body as \u2018Brave,'\u201d the brand stated on Instagram.\n\n\u201cBy expressing vulnerability in general, I think we can help each other become stronger feminine beings,\u201d Lifschitz said, according to the Daily Mail. \u201cSo, I am very grateful that I have been given the chance to share and I feel very lucky for being part of a project with so much love in it.\u201d\n\nThe decision to include a transgender model in the lingerie retailer\u2019s store windows comes one year after Victoria\u2019s Secret Chief Marketing Officer Ed Razek was denounced for dismissing the notion of either a transgender or plus-size model in the company\u2019s catalogue or fashion show.\n\nHowever, in August 2019, Victoria\u2019s Secret announced the hiring of its first transgender model, Valentina Sampaio, 22, a Brazilian actor. Sampaio had also been the first transgender model to appear on the cover of Vogue magazine.\n\nBreitbart News reported:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, why doesn\u2019t your show do this? Shouldn\u2019t you have transsexuals in the show? No. No, I don\u2019t think we should,\u201d Razek said in an interview with Vogue. \u201cWell, why not? Because the show is a fantasy. It\u2019s a 42-minute entertainment special. That\u2019s what it is.\u201d Razek was later forced to apologize for his remarks, admitting that they were \u201cinsensitive.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy remark regarding the inclusion of transgender models in the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show came across as insensitive. I apologize,\u201d Razek said. \u201cTo be clear, we absolutely would cast a transgender model for the show. We\u2019ve had transgender models come to castings \u2026 And like many others, they didn\u2019t make it \u2026 But it was never about gender. I admire and respect their journey to embrace who they really are.\u201d", "description": "Lingerie brand Victoria\u2019s Secret featured a transgender model in the windows of its stores in New York City and London on Friday.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/VS-trans-models-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
