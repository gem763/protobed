He also paid for their Portland, Ore., hotel rooms and would regularly babysit the children while the mother looked for work, according to court documents.\n\n\"In terms of the sexual exploitation and abuse of children, this defendant is the worst this courthouse has ever seen,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Kerin. \"(Kowalczyk) showed no remorse. He will always be a predatory sex offender as long as he lives.\"\n\n\"It turns out that Andrew was actually a monster.\" \u2014 Kowalczyk's victim\n\nKowalczyk was arrested on unrelated charges in Puyallup, Washington, on Dec. 27, 2007. He was pulled over by police in Des Moines, Washington, and refused to step out of his vehicle.\n\nPolice said Kowalczyk didn't own the car he was driving, didn't have a driver's license and gave officers a fake name. The incident led to a high-speed car chase that police suspended for public safety reasons. However, Kowalczyk was arrested a day later at the Northwest Motor Inn in Puyallup trying to leave in a cab.\n\nIt was then that authorities seized the bags he was carrying. They found his cameras and a hard drive that contained 650 child pornography images and videos. Several files showed him sexually abusing two very young children and metadata embedded in some of the digital images revealed they were taken using the camera found in Kowalczyk's luggage.\n\nPuyallup police published some of the non-pornographic images to help locate victims.\n\nIn February 2008, a federal grand jury charged Kowalczyk with a single count of sexual exploitation of a child. In March that year, investigators carried out a search warrant of a storage locker Kowalczky rented and found a sofa, mirror and several shirts that were seen in the pornographic images found on his devices. A superseding indictment with eight additional counts of sexual exploitation of children was returned on March 21, 2012.\n\nSince he was first indicted, Kowalczyk has tried to delay his trial by replacing his counsel more than a dozen times. He's also filed motions to suppress evidence and even attempted to obstruct justice while he was behind bars by asking his father to retrieve other incriminating evidence found on hard drives before they could be seized by authorities. He also solicited the murder of an assistant U.S. attorney, according to authorities.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Andrew Kowalczyk's abuse and torture of his victims was unthinkable and will forever impact their lives,\" said Billy Williams, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon. \"Kowalczyk tried every conceivable tactic to delay prosecution and rob his young victims of the justice they deserve. Today, his attempts to delay punishment for his horrific crimes have ended.\"", "description": "After nearly a decade of delays, a man described as a \"monster\" and called the \"worst of the worst\" was sentenced Monday to 270 years in prison for the rape, sexual abuse and torture of three young girls he often offered to babysit.", "authors": ["Barnini Chakraborty", "Kowalczyk'S Victim"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Andrew-Franklin-Kowalczyk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
