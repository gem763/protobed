New option gives people a tax-efficient way to remain in their existing work pension scheme while they decide a longer-term plan\n\nThis option had already been available through drawdown pension products, but these had been effectively limited to wealthier pension savers. There remained a question as to how those with smaller pots would use the new flexibility.\n\n\n\nThe new option revealed in the draft guidance allows these retirees to leave their savings within their scheme but withdraw lumps sums in a tax efficient way. People get to leave their retirement savings invested - or \u2018uncrystallised\u2019 as the Treasury terms it.\n\nEach lump sum you take will be 25 per cent tax-free, reflecting the 25 per cent tax-free cash that is available on all pension funds, and 75 per cent taxed at your marginal rate - whichever rate your total taxable income, including the taxable chunk of your pension withdrawal, puts you into that year.\n\n\n\nThe new option announced by HMRC today is part of sweeping 'pension freedom' reforms aimed at giving people far greater decision-making power over their retirement savings and how to access their money, spend or invest it.\n\nOther options are to buy an annuity, which provides you with a set income for life, or to get an income drawdown product.\n\nAnd from April next year, you will also be given the freedom to take your whole retirement pot and do something else with it entirely.\n\nThe advantages and drawbacks of each approach will depend on your personal circumstances.\n\n\n\nHowever, the new option announced by HMRC today will give people a tax-efficient way to just stick with their existing work pension while they decide a longer-term plan.\n\nThe Treasury's draft plans on pension drawdown and tax can be found here.", "description": "People in work pensions are to be given a new tax-efficient option to take lump sums out of their savings pots when they wish as they approach retirement.", "authors": ["Tanya Jefferies For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
