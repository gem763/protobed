Louise Kennerley\n\nHow's this for a cosy board. At Home Co, even the independent directors appointed to keep a powerful executive chairman in check have long, pre-existing relationships with that same chairman.\n\nThe soon-to-be-listed commercial property company is headed by ex-UBS Australia managing director David Di Pilla, whose position as both chairman and CEO is fairly safe given he also set up aged-care operator Aurrum, one of the foundation shareholders that will hold 59 per cent of the company post-listing.\n\nSitting with him on the board is Zac Friend, of foundation shareholder and Home Co tenant Spotlight, and Greg Hayes, who used to head Tenix, a company founded by Di Pilla's wife's family. Hayes is also involved with Di Pilla in Aurrum.\n\nAs the prospectus points out, investing in a company that tightly controlled poses some risks. But they are ameliorated, would-be investors were assured, by the addition of three non-executive directors to represent the new shareholders, led by deputy chairman Chris Saxon.\n\nMind you, they're also independent directors Di Pilla already knows pretty well.", "description": "At Home Co, even the independent directors appointed to keep a powerful executive chairman in check have long, pre-existing relationships with that same chairman.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5609%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4f061750315ee0b0a1c6656ff0b39c70cb3b3701", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
