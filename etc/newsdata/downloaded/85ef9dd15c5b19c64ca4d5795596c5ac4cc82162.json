Tulsi Gabbard is threatening to boycott Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Ohio, criticizing the Democratic National Committee and corporate media for \u201crigging\u201d the 2020 election against \u201cthe American people\u201d in early voting states.\n\nInterested in Democratic Party?

After failing to make the debate stage in September, her campaign at the time cited what they describe as several irregularities in the selection and timing of the DNC sponsored polls.\n\nAccording to the criteria that the DNC set forth, 2020 presidential candidates must meet the donor threshold of 130,000 unique donors and 2% in four DNC qualified polls for Tuesday's debate. Gabbard had exceeded the donor threshold for the September debate but needed two polls to meet the debate criteria.\n\nGabbard\u2019s campaign had exceeded 2% support in over two dozen polls, but only two of the polls she had at the time were among those included on the DNC\u2019s \u201ccertified\u201d list. She has been polling among the bottom tier in such certified polls.\n\nIn a press release, the campaign said many of the uncertified polls, including those conducted by highly reputable organizations such as The Economist and the Boston Globe, are ranked by Real Clear Politics and FiveThirtyEight as more accurate than some DNC \u201ccertified\u201d polls.\u201d\n\nThe Hawaii congresswoman, who stepped down as a DNC vice chairwoman to support Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 bid in 2016, railed against her party saying, \u201cthe 2016 Democratic Primary election was rigged by the DNC and their partners in the corporate media against Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nFellow 2020 candidate Marianne Williamson, who is also polling among the bottom tier of contenders in certified polls, came to Gabbard\u2019s defense saying on Twitter \u201cI have great respect for Tulsi for saying such inconvenient truth. She is absolutely correct.\u201d\n\nI have great respect for Tulsi for saying such inconvenient truth. She is absolutely correct. https://t.co/HDRV5avPMO \u2014 Marianne Williamson (@marwilliamson) October 10, 2019\n\nGabbard has been a vocal critic of the DNC\u2019s rules surrounding the debates, calling them out for banning candidates from participating in issue-based debates. Last week in New Hampshire, she said, \"If I as a candidate go and participate in one of these debates or forums, that is not sanctioned by the DNC, the DNC says they will ban me from participating in any future DNC debate. That doesn't sound very democratic to me. This was a rule that was implemented in 2016. And it was a major issue that I raised when I was vice chair of the DNC at that time for this very reason.\"\n\n(MORE: Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard changes course on impeachment inquiry)\n\nBut Gabbard also claimed that she was \u201clooking forward\u201d to using the upcoming debate platform and speak to millions of people and deliver her message.\n\n\u201cIt's a challenging setup and dynamic that are on these debates where, you know, you never know exactly how much talk time you'll actually have, and being able to speak out on different issues of importance.\u201d", "description": "Rep.
