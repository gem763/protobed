Reuters TV via REUTERS\n\nThe National Basketball Association spent years building a huge following and burgeoning business in China, a market worth an estimated $4 billion for the league, but its future in the country is suddenly on shaky ground.\n\n\u201cI felt we had made enormous progress in terms of building cultural exchanges with the Chinese people. And, again, I have regret that much of that was lost,\u201d Silver said at the Time 100 Health Summit in New York.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m not even sure where we\u2019ll go from here, but the direct answer to your question is the financial consequences have been and may continue to be fairly dramatic.\u201d\n\nThe controversy began this month after Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for the pro-democracy demonstrators in a since-deleted post that included an image captioned: \u201cFight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of Morey\u2019s tweet, China did not broadcast or stream the two preseason games that were held in the country between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets while the NBA canceled many player appearances.\n\nCorporate partners in the country have also scrapped or suspended relations with the league.\n\n\u201cOur games are not back on the air in China as we speak,\u201d Silver said in his first public appearance since returning from his recent trip to Asia.\n\nSilver also said the Chinese government has asked that Morey, who was named the NBA\u2019s executive of the year in 2018, be fired for the tweet.\n\n\u201cWe said there\u2019s no chance that\u2019s happening,\u201d said Silver, who has previously stated the league would not apologize for Morey expressing his freedom of expression. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him.\u201d\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang denied that Beijing made such a demand against Morey, however.\n\n\u201cWe especially went to the relevant departments to check on this claim,\u201d Geng told reporters during the ministry\u2019s daily briefing in the Chinese capital on Friday. \u201cThe Chinese government has never made this kind of request.\u201d", "description": "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said on Thursday that the fallout following a tweet from a Houston Rockets official who backed the Hong Kong democracy protests has already cost the league substantial financial losses in China.", "authors": ["Frank Pingue", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442205432&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G297", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
