No other punishment is suitable other than immediate imprisonment; it must be of some length to mark public disapproval of people such as yourself and your activities.\u2019\n\nDS Shaun Holyhead of RTPC said: \u2018I am pleased with the conviction and sentence handed down today. We are working hard to identify Calinescu\u2019s associates and other criminals who target Londoners in this way.\u2019\n\nCalinescu, of no fixed address, admitted four charges of theft.", "description": "Romanian Daniel Calinescu, 42, stole \u00a311,200 from four women aged between 62 and 78 in a crime wave across London spanning six weeks.", "authors": ["Martin Robinson", "Chief Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/12/19784126-0-image-a-69_1571223819391.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
