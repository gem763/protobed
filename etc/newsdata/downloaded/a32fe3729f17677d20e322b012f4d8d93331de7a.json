His latest book, \u201cReforming Journalism,\u201d is a philosophical and even theological deconstruction of historic and contemporary media.\n\nMr. Olasky dismisses the notion of \u201cobjectivity\u201d in journalism. Everyone has a belief system, he argues, and it influences how each person approaches stories.\n\nThe author says American journalism has gone through four phases: In phase one, \u201cmany early American journalists assumed God is objectively real, with an existence independent of our minds.\u201d Noting that the spiritual, then, regularly shaped the way journalists looked at the world, he adds, \u201cAlthough no one in early American journalism used the term \u2018objective reporting,\u2019 some editors obviously understood that factuality demanded taking into account the spiritual.\u201d\n\nThen came phase two: \u201cStarting midway through the 19th century, though, a new phase in the understanding of objectivity took hold among American journalists. They began to see \u2018fact\u2019 only as that which was scientifically measurable. As photographs began to provide a record of the visible, many journalists equated the visible with the real and began seeing the world as largely non-mysterious. They did not use the term \u2018objectivity,\u2019 but they made their own eyes the standard of authority: they were human cameras.\u201d\n\nWhat did those human cameras produce? Phase three, which was influenced by the rise of Marxism and Freudianism: \u201cObjectivity could be reached, they thought, only through a balancing of multiple subjectivities. The outcome might be neither truthful nor accurate, but who knew what accuracy, let alone truth, really was? The triumph of theological liberalism in major Protestant denominations in the United States occurred at the same time. \u2026 This was no coincidence, since the balancing-of-subjectivities mode often suggests right or wrong does not exist \u2014 just opinion.\u201d\n\nPhase four was characterized by \u201cdisguised subjectivity, sometimes called \u2018strategic ritual\u2019 (pseudo-objectivity that provides defense against criticism). A key aspect of strategic ritual is choice of sources and selection of quotations. With half a dozen legitimate spokesmen on a particular issue, reporters can readily play journalistic ventriloquism by using the one who expresses their own position. As NBC reporter Norma Quarles acknowledged, \u2018If I get the sense that things are boiling over, I can\u2019t really say it. I have to get somebody else to say it.\u2019\u201d\n\nLate in the last century, Mr. Olasky writes, \u201c\u2026 some well-known American television journalists attacked the entire concept of objectivity. Robert Bazell said, \u2018Objectivity is a fallacy. \u2026 There are different opinions, but you don\u2019t have to give them equal weight.\u2019 Linda Ellerbee wrote, \u2018There is no such thing as objectivity. Any reporter who tells you he\u2019s objective is lying to you.\u2019 In the United States, some writers argued for a \u2018new journalism\u2019 in which reporters emphasized their own subjective impressions.\u201d\n\nBeyond the predictable distrust of journalists this has caused, the claim of objectivity has had considerable limitations. Some examples: \u201cReporters have never felt the need to balance anti-cancer statements with pro-cancer statements. In recent practice, secular-liberal reporters have seen pro-life concerns or \u2018homophobia\u2019 as cancerous, and many other Christian beliefs as similarly harmful. Objectivity was a reporting of multiple subjectivities, and truth was out there at a constantly receding horizon. If journalists in phase two happily saw themselves as cameras, journalists in phase three unhappily started to see themselves as stenographers or tape recorders.\u201d\n\nSee how this works? It\u2019s the same with \u201cclimate change,\u201d abortion and many other issues. Anyone who goes against the faith of the secular-progressive culture is simply ignored, or ridiculed. In totalitarian societies it\u2019s called propaganda.\n\nMr. Olasky\u2019s faith shapes his positions, as the non-faith of secular progressives shapes theirs. For journalism to recover its reputation, a degree of fairness, accuracy and at least small doses of \u201cobjectivity\u201d when reporting issues needs to be restored. Mr. Olasky\u2019s book shows the way.\n\n\u2022 Cal Thomas, a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States\u201d (HarperCollins/Zondervan, January 2020).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
