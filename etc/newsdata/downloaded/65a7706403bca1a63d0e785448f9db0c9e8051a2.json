In the interest of world peace, the couple settled on a very millennial solution. They decided to visit Iran to show the world what the country is really like. They succeeded, but not in the way they imagined. Iranian authorities arrested them, threw them in prison and have held them incommunicado for 10 weeks. In seeking peaceful relations with Iran, this couple had had as much chance as the proverbial snowflakes in hell. But they are not alone in their misreading of the Tehran regime.\n\nPresident Obama and his national security team believed that Iran could be treated as a rational actor on the world stage and would abide by agreements to suspend its nuclear program in exchange for dropping sanctions. Mr. Obama\u2019s national security team chose not to address Iran\u2019s support of terrorism and other bad behavior in Syria and Yemen in pursuit of the limited nuclear agreement. The theory was that other issues could be put aside until an era of good feelings between Tehran and Washington could be established. Iran\u2019s leaders promptly used the money regained in the nuclear deal to ramp up its bullying in the region. This fact was ignored in Washington and in the capitals of the other nations involved in the nuclear negotiation until Donald Trump took office.\n\nOur allies were appalled when the Trump administration scrapped the deal, but Iranian antics in the interim have finally convinced most participants in the denuclearization attempt that the Iranians are not responsible international actors. The two Australian innocents were not the only fools to assume that the Iranian government would respond favorably if only shown a little love.\n\nThe Trump administration has tried peaceful means in employing the coercion of economic pressure combined with diplomacy in attempting modification of Iranian behavior, but the Iranians have mistaken U.S. restraint for weakness and have continued to push the envelope of kinetic action to a point where they will eventually miscalculate and force a U.S. response. If and when that happens, the nature of the response will be a key event in the future of the region. The Trump administration has been reasonable in wanting to avoid another seemingly open-ended conflict, but there are a wide range of options between doing nothing \u2014 which would be disastrous \u2014 and an all-out invasion involving regime change that would be equally ill-advised.\n\nThe worst thing that the administration could do if Iran irrevocably crosses the kinetic line would be a \u201cproportionate response.\u201d The cynical decision-makers among Iran\u2019s ayatollahs and Revolutionary Guard would quickly read this as weakness as did their counterparts in Saigon during the Vietnam War. They would gauge how much pain they could stand and continue on whatever vector they think they can get away with. We would then find ourselves in yet another endless war.\n\nThe correct response would be to totally eliminate the Iranian ability to project military power beyond its shores. It would mean the destruction by air and sea attacks on Iran\u2019s air defense system, ballistic missile systems, air force and navy. It would also mean the destruction of Iran\u2019s entire oil infrastructure and selected portions of its nuclear program that would not produce fallout. These strikes would be followed by a blockade of Iran that would block everything but humanitarian aid. Once that is completed, we should stop shooting. No offer of negotiations or international mediation need follow. If the Iranians then want to talk, they should come to us. Without communication from Tehran, we should let them deal with consequences. Any attempt to rebuild strategic assets would trigger more strikes.\n\nWar would be expensive in casualties and cost. The Iranians have spent years building up an anti-navy and air defense capability. We would also have to reinforce the borders of Iraq and Afghanistan to protect them from ground attack. We would likely lose planes, ships and personnel in such a conflict. Before they lose their capability to retaliate, the Iranians could also launch ballistic missile attacks on Israel and Sunni nations in the region. The best way to avoid this situation would be for the president to make it absolutely clear that we are willing to go to such lengths.\n\nIf the Iranian leadership realizes that it faces the possibility of being disarmed in a region full of enemies, they might reconsider their present course. Iran doesn\u2019t crave love, but weakness and humiliation would be intolerable.\n\n\u2022 Gary Anderson lectures in Alternative Analysis at the George Washington University\u2019s Elliott School of International Affairs.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
