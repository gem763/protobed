Center Lake Capital\n\nAdam Parker has been focused on running his own hedge fund as long as he can remember. It's why he worked to get into the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, why he chose to join a relatively unknown hedge fund out of school instead of what was then one of the biggest investment banks in the world, and why he's already running $350 million at his own fund before the age of 35.\n\n\"People should do what they're passionate about,\" he said.\n\nHis fund, Center Lake Capital, started with $30 million five years ago, but his strategy of making concentrated bets in under-the-radar software companies has attracted more capital. The firm just outgrew its shared offices in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City and is moving to its own space near Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan, he said.\n\nHe started investing in college after he sold a GrubHub-like company he and a couple friends started. From there, he interned at the Lehman Brothers real-estate group in summer 2007 and was choosing between returning for a full-time position or joining the now shuttered Force Capital. He chose Force.\n\n\"At the time, my parents didn't think it was the smartest thing, but that's what I wanted to do,\" he said.\n\nAfter working as analyst, he eventually interviewed with billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller to join his fund Duquesne Capital right before it turned into a family office. Parker then joined State Point Capital, which was started by Duquesne veterans, and became a portfolio manager after just a year, running $150 million to start out.\n\nCenter Lake launched in 2014 with multiyear commitments from a few critical investors, Parker said. Now he believes the firm has differentiated itself because of the concentrated investments and specific focus within the tech world.\n\n\"You have to be focused, because everything is a tech company now,\" he said.\n\nHe foresees the fund getting bigger, even \"multiples bigger, but not five multiples.\"\n\n\"We don't want to be a multibillion fund.\"", "description": "From starting a hedge fund before 30 to running alternative-data shops and helping lead $27 billion investments, this group is in a league of its own.", "authors": ["Meghan Morris", "Dan Defrancesco", "Casey Sullivan"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8d277d2e22af69653b083b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
