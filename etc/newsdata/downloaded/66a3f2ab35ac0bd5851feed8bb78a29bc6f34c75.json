It\u2019s ridiculous. We\u2019re all trying to get psyched up, but shaking hands with your opponent \u2014 that\u2019s NFL etiquette. And when you pull bush league stuff, that\u2019s disrespectful to the game. And believe me, that\u2019s going to get us fired up.\u201d\n\nIn a viral video, 49ers and Browns players met at midfield for the coin toss. Sherman walked down the line of Cleveland players and exchanged words and handshakes. When he arrives at Mayfield, he appeared to have a physical interaction with the quarterback and said a few words.\n\nPpl freaking out over a handshake gave me a good laugh. I will lose no sleep over it and have moved on to the next opponent.\u2014 Richard Sherman (@RSherman_25) October 8, 2019\n\nAfter video of the pre-coin flip interaction between Sherman and Mayfield went viral, the cornerback clarified his original comment and told reporters Tuesday the 49ers were angry that Mayfield darted away immediately after the coin toss.\n\nIn another viral video, Mayfield is seen running off the field after the Browns elected to receive and Sherman appeared to wave goodbye to him.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. They are making way too big of a story of a blowout,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cHe [expletive] us off. We put a foot in his [expletive]. End of story.\u201d\n\nSherman intercepted Mayfield on the Browns\u2019 second offensive possession as the 49ers earned a 31-3 blowout victory over Cleveland.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 San Francisco 49ers veteran cornerback Richard Sherman took issue with what he said was a lack of respect from Cleveland Browns", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
