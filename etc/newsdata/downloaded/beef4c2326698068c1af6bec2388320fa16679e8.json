The calculus of racism underwent swift revision when waves of culturally diverse immigrants from the far corners of Europe changed the face of the country.\n\nAs the historian Matthew Frye Jacobson shows in his immigrant history \u201cWhiteness of a Different Color,\u201d the surge of newcomers engendered a national panic and led Americans to adopt a more restrictive, politicized view of how whiteness was to be allocated. Journalists, politicians, social scientists and immigration officials embraced the habit, separating ostensibly white Europeans into \u201craces.\u201d Some were designated \u201cwhiter\u201d \u2014 and more worthy of citizenship \u2014 than others, while some were ranked as too close to blackness to be socially redeemable. The story of how Italian immigrants went from racialized pariah status in the 19th century to white Americans in good standing in the 20th offers a window onto the alchemy through which race is constructed in the United States, and how racial hierarchies can sometimes change.\n\nDarker skinned southern Italians endured the penalties of blackness on both sides of the Atlantic. In Italy, Northerners had long held that Southerners \u2014 particularly Sicilians \u2014 were an \u201cuncivilized\u201d and racially inferior people, too obviously African to be part of Europe.\n\nRacist dogma about Southern Italians found fertile soil in the United States. As the historian Jennifer Guglielmo writes, the newcomers encountered waves of books, magazines and newspapers that \u201cbombarded Americans with images of Italians as racially suspect.\u201d They were sometimes shut out of schools, movie houses and labor unions, or consigned to church pews set aside for black people. They were described in the press as \u201cswarthy,\u201d \u201ckinky haired\u201d members of a criminal race and derided in the streets with epithets like \u201cdago,\u201d \u201cguinea\u201d \u2014 a term of derision applied to enslaved Africans and their descendants \u2014 and more familiarly racist insults like \u201cwhite nigger\u201d and \u201cnigger wop.\u201d\n\nItalian-Americans were often used as cheap labor on the docks of New Orleans at the turn of the last century. Library of Congress Mulberry Street in the Little Italy section of New York around 1900. Library of Congress\n\nThe penalties of blackness went well beyond name-calling in the apartheid South. Italians who had come to the country as \u201cfree white persons\u201d were often marked as black because they accepted \u201cblack\u201d jobs in the Louisiana sugar fields or because they chose to live among African-Americans. This left them vulnerable to marauding mobs like the ones that hanged, shot, dismembered or burned alive thousands of black men, women and children across the South.\n\nThe federal holiday honoring the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus \u2014 celebrated on Monday \u2014 was central to the process through which Italian-Americans were fully ratified as white during the 20th century. The rationale for the holiday was steeped in myth, and allowed Italian-Americans to write a laudatory portrait of themselves into the civic record.\n\nFew who march in Columbus Day parades or recount the tale of Columbus\u2019s voyage from Europe to the New World are aware of how the holiday came about or that President Benjamin Harrison proclaimed it as a one-time national celebration in 1892 \u2014 in the wake of a bloody New Orleans lynching that took the lives of 11 Italian immigrants. The proclamation was part of a broader attempt to quiet outrage among Italian-Americans, and a diplomatic blowup over the murders that brought Italy and the United States to the brink of war.\n\nHistorians have recently showed that America\u2019s dishonorable response to this barbaric event was partly conditioned by racist stereotypes about Italians promulgated in Northern newspapers like The Times. A striking analysis by Charles Seguin, a sociologist at Pennsylvania State University, and Sabrina Nardin, a doctoral student at the University of Arizona, shows that the protests lodged by the Italian government inspired something that had failed to coalesce around the brave African-American newspaper editor and anti-lynching campaigner Ida B. Wells \u2014 a broad anti-lynching effort.\n\nA Black \u2018Brute\u2019 Lynched\n\nThe lynchings of Italians came at a time when newspapers in the South had established the gory convention of advertising the far more numerous public murders of African-Americans in advance \u2014 to attract large crowds \u2014 and justifying the killings by labeling the victims \u201cbrutes,\u201d \u201cfiends,\u201d \u201cravishers,\u201d \u201cborn criminals\u201d or \u201ctroublesome Negroes.\u201d Even high-minded news organizations that claimed to abhor the practice legitimized lynching by trafficking in racist stereotypes about its victims.\n\nAs Mr. Seguin recently showed, many Northern newspapers were \u201cjust as complicit\u201d in justifying mob violence as their Southern counterparts. For its part, The Times made repeated use of the headline \u201cA Brutal Negro Lynched,\u201d presuming the victims\u2019 guilt and branding them as congenital criminals. Lynchings of black men in the South were often based on fabricated accusations of sexual assault. As the Equal Justice Initiative explained in its 2015 report on lynching in America, a rape charge could occur in the absence of an actual victim and might arise from minor violations of the social code \u2014 like complimenting a white woman on her appearance or even bumping into her on the street.\n\nThe Times was not owned by the family that controls it today when it dismissed Ida B. Wells as a \u201cslanderous and nasty-minded mulattress\u201d for rightly describing rape allegations as \u201ca thread bare lie\u201d that Southerners used against black men who had consensual sexual relationships with white women. Nevertheless, as a Times editorialist of nearly 30 years standing \u2014 and a student of the institution\u2019s history \u2014 I am outraged and appalled by the nakedly racist treatment my 19th-century predecessors displayed in writing about African-Americans and Italian immigrants.\n\nWhen Wells took her anti-lynching campaign to England in the 1890s, Times editors rebuked her for representing \u201cblack brutes\u201d abroad in an editorial that joked about what they described as \u201cthe practice of roasting Negro ravishers alive and boring out their eyes with red-hot pokers.\u201d The editorial slandered African-Americans generally, referring to rape as \u201ca crime to which Negroes are particularly prone.\u201d The Times editors may have lodged objections to lynching \u2014 but they did so in a rhetoric firmly rooted in white supremacy.\n\n\u2018Assassins by Nature\u2019\n\nItalian immigrants were welcomed into Louisiana after the Civil War, when the planter class was in desperate need of cheap labor to replace newly emancipated black people, who were leaving backbreaking jobs in the fields for more gainful employment.\n\nThese Italians seemed at first to be the answer to both the labor shortage and the increasingly pressing quest for settlers who would support white domination in the emerging Jim Crow state. Louisiana\u2019s romance with Italian labor began to sour when the new immigrants balked at low wages and dismal working conditions.\n\nThe newcomers also chose to live together in Italian neighborhoods, where they spoke their native tongue, preserved Italian customs and developed successful businesses that catered to African-Americans, with whom they fraternized and intermarried. In time, this proximity to blackness would lead white Southerners to view Sicilians, in particular, as not fully white and to see them as eligible for persecution \u2014 including lynching \u2014 that had customarily been imposed on African-Americans.\n\nClams being sold from a cart in Little Italy. Library of Congress Many Italian-Americans lived in a section of New Orleans that became known as Little Palermo. Library of Congress\n\nNevertheless, as the historian Jessica Barbata Jackson showed recently in the journal Louisiana History, Italian newcomers were still well thought of in New Orleans in the 1870s when negative stereotypes were being established in the Northern press.\n\nThe Times, for instance, described them as bandits and members of the criminal classes who were \u201cwretchedly poor and unskilled,\u201d \u201cstarving and wholly destitute.\u201d The stereotype about inborn criminality is plainly evident in an 1874 story about Italian immigrants seeking vaccinations that refers to one immigrant as a \u201cburly fellow, whose appearance was like that of the traditional brigand of the Abruzzi.\u201d\n\nA Times story in 1880 described immigrants, including Italians, as \u201clinks in a descending chain of evolution.\u201d These characterizations reached a defamatory crescendo in an 1882 editorial that appeared under the headline \u201cOur Future Citizens.\u201d The editors wrote:\n\n\u201cThere has never been since New York was founded so low and ignorant a class among the immigrants who poured in here as the Southern Italians who have been crowding our docks during the past year.\u201d\n\nThe editors reserved their worst invective for Italian immigrant children, whom they described as \u201cutterly unfit \u2014 ragged, filthy, and verminous as they were \u2014 to be placed in the public primary schools among the decent children of American mechanics.\u201d\n\nThe racist myth that African-Americans and Sicilians were both innately criminal drove an 1887 Times story about a lynching victim in Mississippi whose name was given as \u201cDago Joe\u201d \u2014 \u201cdago\u201d being a slur directed at Italian and Spanish-speaking immigrants. The victim was described as a \u201chalf breed\u201d who \u201cwas the son of a Sicilian father and a mulatto mother, and had the worst characteristics of both races in his makeup. He was cunning, treacherous and cruel, and was regarded in the community where he lived as an assassin by nature.\u201d\n\nSicilians as \u2018Rattlesnakes\u2019\n\nThe carnage in New Orleans was set in motion in the fall of 1890, when the city\u2019s popular police chief, David Hennessy, was assassinated on his way home one evening. Hennessy had no shortage of enemies. The historian John V. Baiamonte Jr. writes that he had once been tried for murder in connection with the killing of a professional rival. He is also said to have been involved in a feud between two Italian businessmen. On the strength of a clearly suspect witness who claimed to hear Mr. Hennessy say that \u201cdagoes\u201d had shot him, the city charged 19 Italians with complicity in the chief\u2019s murder.\n\nThe monument to David Hennessy rises above nearly all the other tombs in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans. William Widmer for The New York Times\n\nThat the evidence was distressingly weak was evident from the verdicts that were swiftly handed down: Of the first nine to be tried, six were acquitted; three others were granted mistrials. The leaders of the mob that then went after them advertised their plans in advance, knowing full well that the city\u2019s elites \u2014 who coveted the businesses the Italians had built or hated the Italians for fraternizing with African-Americans \u2014 would never seek justice for the dead. After the lynching, a grand jury investigation pronounced the killings praiseworthy, turning that inquiry into what the historian Barbara Botein describes as \u201cpossibly one of the greatest whitewashes in American history.\u201d\n\nThe blood of the New Orleans victims was scarcely dry when The Times published a cheerleading news story \u2014 \u201cChief Hennessy Avenged: Eleven of his Italian Assassins Lynched by a Mob\u201d \u2014 that reveled in the bloody details. It reported that the mob had consisted \u201cmostly of the best element\u201d of New Orleans society. The following day, a scabrous Times editorial justified the lynching \u2014 and dehumanized the dead, with by-now-familiar racist stereotypes.\n\n\u201cThese sneaking and cowardly Sicilians,\u201d the editors wrote, \u201cthe descendants of bandits and assassins, who have transported to this country the lawless passions, the cutthroat practices \u2026 are to us a pest without mitigations. Our own rattlesnakes are as good citizens as they. Our own murderers are men of feeling and nobility compared to them.\u201d The editors concluded of the lynching that it would be difficult to find \u201cone individual who would confess that privately he deplores it very much.\u201d\n\nLynchers in 1891 storming the New Orleans city jail, where they killed 11 Italian-Americans accused in the fatal shooting of Chief Hennessy. Italian Tribune\n\nPresident Harrison would have ignored the New Orleans carnage had the victims been black. But the Italian government made that impossible. It broke off diplomatic relations and demanded an indemnity that the Harrison administration paid. Harrison even called on Congress in his 1891 State of the Union to protect foreign nationals \u2014 though not black Americans \u2014 from mob violence.\n\nHarrison\u2019s Columbus Day proclamation in 1892 opened the door for Italian-Americans to write themselves into the American origin story, in a fashion that piled myth upon myth. As the historian Danielle Battisti shows in \u201cWhom We Shall Welcome,\u201d they rewrote history by casting Columbus as \u201cthe first immigrant\u201d \u2014 even though he never set foot in North America and never immigrated anywhere (except possibly to Spain), and even though the United States did not exist as a nation during his 15th-century voyage. The mythologizing, carried out over many decades, granted Italian-Americans \u201ca formative role in the nation-building narrative.\u201d It also tied Italian-Americans closely to the paternalistic assertion, still heard today, that Columbus \u201cdiscovered\u201d a continent that was already inhabited by Native Americans.\n\nThe \u201cMonument to the Immigrant,\u201d commissioned by the Italian American Marching Club of New Orleans, stands along the Mississippi River in Woldenberg Park. William Widmer for The New York Times\n\nBut in the late 19th century, the full-blown Columbus myth was yet to come. The New Orleans lynching solidified a defamatory view of Italians generally, and Sicilians in particular, as irredeemable criminals who represented a danger to the nation. The influential anti-immigrant racist Representative Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, soon to join the United States Senate, quickly appropriated the event. He argued that a lack of confidence in juries, not mob violence, had been the real problem in New Orleans. \u201cLawlessness and lynching are evil things,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut a popular belief that juries cannot be trusted is even worse.\u201d\n\nFacts aside, Lodge argued, beliefs about immigrants were in themselves sufficient to warrant higher barriers to immigration. Congress ratified that notion during the 1920s, curtailing Italian immigration on racial grounds, even though Italians were legally white, with all of the rights whiteness entailed.\n\nThe Italian-Americans who labored in the campaign that overturned racist immigration restrictions in 1965 used the romantic fictions built up around Columbus to political advantage. This shows yet again how racial categories that people mistakenly view as matters of biology grow out of highly politicized myth making.", "description": "Vicious bigotry, reluctant acceptance: an American story.", "authors": ["Brent Staples", "Mr. Staples Is A Member Of The Editorial Board."], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/opinion/oocolumb6/oocolumb6-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
