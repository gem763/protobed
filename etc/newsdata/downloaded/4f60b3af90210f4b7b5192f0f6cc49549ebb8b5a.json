(Montgomery County Police)\n\nThe suspect, Lawrence Edward Sakkestad of Germantown, was found covered in blood when police arrived at his home Monday night, detectives said in the records. The victim\u2019s body was found on the floor of the bathroom.\n\nOn Wednesday, police identified the victim as Jennifer Sparks, 39. Authorities said she had an \u201cunconfirmed address.\u201d\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the victim and suspect may have known each other.\n\nJust before 9 p.m. Monday, police were called about a possible assault in Sakkestad\u2019s home along Dunstable Circle, according to arrest records. Once there, they spoke with him.\n\n\u201cThe suspect made statements on the scene with MCP police officers that he had killed the victim by beating her with a wrench-like implement and cutting her throat with a pocketknife,\u201d court records state. \u201cThe information in Sakkestad\u2019s statement was consistent with the victim\u2019s injuries as well as the evidence observed at the crime scene.\u201d\n\nSome five hours later, when detectives submitted an affidavit to secure the murder charge, they wrote that they had not identified the victim.\n\nSakkestad has had multiple convictions in criminal cases, which also document his struggles with mental illness, court documents show.\n\nOn June 8, 2018, Montgomery Circuit Judge Gary Bair imposed treatment conditions on Sakkestad\u2019s probation in one of those cases that included twice-a-week group sessions and once-a-week individual therapy sessions.\n\nThree years ago in that case, an attorney who represented him wrote, \u201cMr. Sakkestad suffers from several long-standing substance abuse and mental health problems.\u201d\n\nDana Hedgpeth contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Police say Lawrence Sakkestad, 34, was found covered in blood at his Germantown home.", "authors": ["Dan Morse", "Reporter Covering Courts", "Crime In Montgomery County", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IgoCOOj7iQFQ0ZmhcSovmCIwodI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FQ7QY6FHAEI6RLLPBADXBXG5YI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
