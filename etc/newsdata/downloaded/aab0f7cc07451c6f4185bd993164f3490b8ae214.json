Police say they have shown restraint in the face of increased violence.\n\nLam Chi-wai, chairman of the Junior Police Officers Association, urged the city authorities to impose a curfew to maintain public order, according to a statement released on Wednesday.\n\n\"We are only an enforcement agency with limited power under the law. When facing such a series of massive rioting incidents, we cannot work alone - clapping only with one hand - without appropriate measures and support from top level,\" Lam said.\n\nThe lawyer for an Indonesian journalist injured when police fired a projectile during protests on Sunday said she will be left blind in one eye.\n\nThe European Union said in a statement it was deeply troubled by the escalation of violence in the territory and that the only way forward was through \"restraint, de-escalation and dialogue\".\n\nThe protests started over a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, but have evolved into calls for democracy, among other demands, and plunged the city into its biggest political crisis in decades.\n\nProtesters are also angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in the city's affairs despite a promise of autonomy in the \"one country, two systems\" formula under which Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997.\n\nChina dismisses accusations it is meddling in Hong Kong and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up anti-China sentiment.", "description": "Tsang Chi-kin charged with two counts of assaulting police and one count of rioting during a protest on Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/3/9b619bf073e04d01bc5e41371357d854_18.jpg"}
