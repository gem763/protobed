Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 12, 2019\n\nEnvironmental groups have fought unsuccessfully to halt construction in the protected areas, arguing that greater barriers could disrupt wildlife migration corridors and threaten the survival of imperilled species.\n\nBut to date, there has been little mention of the potential damage to archaeological sites, where stone tools, ceramic shards and other pre-Columbian artefacts are extremely well-preserved in the arid environment.\n\nDesert-dwelling peoples have populated the area for at least 16,000 years, particularly around the oasis of Quitobaquito Springs in the national monument, one of the few places where the Quitobaquito pupfish and the endangered Sonoyta mud turtle still live in the wild.\n\nThe oasis was part of a prehistoric trade route, the Old Salt Trail, where northern Mexican commodities including salt, obsidian and seashells were plentiful, according to the Park Service.\n\nThe traders were followed by Spanish missionaries, Western settlers, and other travellers and nomads who came to drink.", "description": "Bulldozers and excavators rushing to instal Donald Trump\u2018s border wall could damage or destroy up to 22 archaeological sites in a US National Monument in Arizona in coming months.Construction threatens the archaeological sites in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, according to an internal National", "authors": ["Juliet Eilperin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xkALUkPMF9wqbVpxEF0.Lg--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/1771015101feba88e3338274ba10e1cb", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
