His whole routine is unfunny, these progressive scolds have harrumphed, as some websites have even urged their readers not to watch the special -- a sure sign that at least some of Chappelle's humor is cutting, transgressive and very funny. Granted, some of the jokes are undoubtedly tasteless and 'problematic,' but that's the point. Comedy is a bastion for such material. In his latest act, which is packed with barbs and observations that will ruffle a wide cross-section of Americans, Chappelle unleashed on Jussie Smollett, the disgraced actor who faked a hate crime in order to increase his prominence and pay, according to Chicago police. Via National Review (strong content warning):\n\nEverybody was furious, especially in Hollywood... \u201cJustice for Juicy\u201d and all this sh**... For some reason, African Americans, we were like oddly quiet. . . . What they didn\u2019t understand is that we were supporting him with our silence. Because we understood that this n****** was clearly lying. None of these details added up at all... \u201cHey man, aren\u2019t you that f***** n***** from Empire?\u201d What the f***? Does that sound like how white people talk? ... It sounds like something that I would say! ... If you a racist and homophobic you don\u2019t even know who this n***** is! You don\u2019t watch Empire\n\n\n\nBlack people never feel sorry for the police, but this time we even felt sorry for the police... [voice of police officer] \u201cOkay, you left the house at 2 a.m., it\u2019s minus 16 degrees. You were walking, you were walking. All riiiight. And ... and where were you going? Subway. Sandwiches? ... That\u2019s when the men approached you ... what did they have on? MAGA hats? MAGA hats in Chicago. ... [aside to another police officer] Find out where Kanye West was last night.\n\n\n\nHe said they put a rope around his neck. Has anyone here ever been to Chicago? All right, so you been there. Now tell me, how much rope do you remember seeing? ... Like when did you get mugged, n*****, 1850? Who\u2019s got rope? ... Not only were they not white, they were very, very black. They were Nigerian, which is the funniest sh**. The whole story is funnier now! [in exaggerated Nigerian accent] \u201cThis is MAGA country, you f***** n*****!\u201d\n\nYou've got to have a heart of stone not to at least crack a smile at that (and at this previous mockery from Chris Rock). Incidentally, on the subject of the Smolett case, the real-life hilarity never ceases to amaze. The hate hoaxer's PR team is insisting that \"every iota\" of the actor's ludicrous and debunked story is true:\n\nJussie Smollett case: PR firm says 'every iota' of 'Empire' actor's claim true; police differ: https://t.co/7n4cRlJDvx \u2014 ABC 7 Chicago (@ABC7Chicago) August 29, 2019\n\n\n\n\"Fully corroborated,\" these Baghdad Bob-esque flacks insist, in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary -- including the confessions of his collaborators. This paragraph is fantastic:\n\nThe statement says \"every iota of information ... Smollett has stated has been fully corroborated.\" The statement didn't say what evidence allegedly backs Smollett's claim that masked men hurling racist and homophobic insults beat him and looped a noose around his neck. The city says GPS data, video and other evidence prove Smollett paid the men to fake a hate crime.\n\nOn one hand, literally baseless assertion. On the other, all of the known facts of the case. You decide. Although as Chappelle says, America already has. Meanwhile, a special prosecutor has been appointed to investigate the scandalous handling of this case by the local prosecutor, whose apparent misconduct and embarrassing ethics have been widely slammed:\n\n\n\n\n\nA high-profile former U.S. Attorney was appointed special prosecutor Friday morning to re-examine the Jussie Smollett case and why charges were abruptly dropped against him. Dan Webb was picked to lead the second look at the notorious false report case \u2014 including whether new charges should be brought against the \u201cEmpire\u201d actor \u2014 by Judge Michael Toomin during a hearing in a Chicago criminal court. Toomin ruled back in June the case was rife with \u201cunprecedented irregularities\u201d and needed a special prosecutor to restore the public\u2019s faith in the justice system...About a month after Smollett was arrested on 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct for filing a police report, State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx quietly, dropped all charges against the actor with little explanation, angering cops and other city officials.\n\nI'll leave you with one more snippet from Chappelle, which tosses a bit of a curveball on abortion (strong content warning):\n\n\u201cIf you can kill this motherfucker, then I can at least abandon \u2018em. It\u2019s my money, my choice. And if I\u2019m wrong, then perhaps we\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is... pretty dark & subversive.pic.twitter.com/546lOZT4Zg \u2014 Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) August 29, 2019\n\n\n\nFeel free to watch the entire act on Netflix, but be forewarned: It's not a walk in the park for conservatives, or anyone else.", "description": "'MAGA hats in Chicago?'.09/02/2019 2:59:39AM EST.", "authors": ["Guy Benson", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/239/45c4ce72-bd72-4314-9837-6ac7e646c195.png"}
