Before that, his opponents are hoping to inflict two more defeats on him.\n\nThis is what\u2019s coming, on a day that saw the pound rally to the highest level against the dollar since July, before paring gains after House of Commons Speaker John Bercow announced he was stepping down.\n\nBefore 7.15 p.m.: Document Release\n\nAn emergency debate aimed at forcing the government to release details on\n\nits no-deal Brexit planning\n\ndiscussions that took place ahead of the decision to suspend parliament for so long\n\nSince Johnson expelled 21 Conservative members of parliament, he\u2019s a long way short of having a majority, and he\u2019s likely to lose.\n\nBefore midnight: Snap General Election\n\nIn the final debate of the evening, Johnson will make a second attempt to get Parliament to vote for a snap general election. He needs two-thirds of MPs -- 434 of them -- to vote for this. Last week he got 298, and there\u2019s no reason to think he\u2019ll get any closer this week.\n\nJohnson could make a statement after the second vote. When that business has finished, Parliament will be \u201cprorogued,\u201d in a ceremony involving a statement from Queen Elizabeth II being read in the upper House of Lords. Parliament will be suspended.\n\nIf all goes as expected, on the six votes that Johnson has tried to win in Parliament since becoming prime minister, he will have been defeated every time.", "description": "Boris Johnson Faces Parliament Defeat on Snap Election: Trader\u2019s Guide", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic81bb28110bcb64b5debd75ad371f170e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
