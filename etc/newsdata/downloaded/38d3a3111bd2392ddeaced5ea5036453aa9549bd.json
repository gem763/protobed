Here is this week\u2019s question.\n\n\n\nQ. I\u2019ve read that property taxes are rising all throughout France. Can you unpack that for me?\n\n\n\nA. Taxes fonci\u00e8res in France, which are paid by the property owner, went up 34.7% in the 10 years between 2008 and 2018, according to a study published last week by the Union Nationale des Propri\u00e9taires Immobiliers (UNPI), an association of private real estate owners in France.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, rents rose by 9.34% and inflation by 9.91%, according to the report, which is based on tax rates published on the Internet portal of the General Directorate of Public Finance and that of the General Directorate of Local Authorities.\n\nMore: Why Are Property Taxes in Greece Higher Than Other Parts of Europe?\n\n\u201cThe property tax has increased 3.7 times faster than rents and 3.5 times faster than inflation,\u201d said Christophe Demerson, president of UNPI, said in a translated statement.\n\n\n\nHowever, generally, the rise is not because municipalities are increasing rates. Instead, it\u2019s because of the ongoing revaluation of properties going on across the country, Mr. Demerson said in the report.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy example, in Is\u00e8re, several tens of thousands of homeowners saw their tax rise by 13% on average,\u201d he noted.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Taxe d\u2019Habitation, a residence tax paid by the occupant of a dwelling, is going down for most taxpayers, as the country is incrementally doing away with the levy.\n\nFrom Penta: Rare $4 Gold Coin Could Be Worth $200,000\n\n\u201cA tax rebate on the main residence and its outbuildings has been set up,\u201d according to Jessica Duterlay, a tax associate at Attorney-Counsel, a law firm with offices in London and Nice, France. \u201cThus, 80% of the population will be phased out of [the tax] gradually over three years [by] 2020.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a limit to the individual\u2019s taxable income, and residents with higher taxable income will not be eligible for the rebate. The limit starts at \u20ac27,000 (USD $30,000) for an individual and rises depending on the size of the household, Ms. Duterlay explained.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the rebate only applies to principal residences, Ms. Duterlay pointed out. And some second-home owners could be charged an additional tax if they live in \u201ca municipality where the tax on vacant housing applies.\u201d\n\n\n\nClick to Read Tax Experts Share Answers and Advice for Readers\u2019 Pressing Tax Questions\n\n\n\nEmail your questions to editors@mansionglobal.com.
