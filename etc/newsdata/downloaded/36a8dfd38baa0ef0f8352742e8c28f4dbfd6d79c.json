They were sent abroad as part of a anti-terrorism assistance programme \"to enhance the ability of their law enforcement to deter and counter terrorism\", according to the report.\n\nPreviously, dogs were trained under a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms initiative. Seventy dogs from that programme remain active in seven partner nations.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The report detailed specific cases, such as a dog who was found emaciated less than one year after arriving in Jordan. That dog also had faeces in her kennel, and no water in her water bowl.\n\nAnother dog from the US had to be euthanised in March 2018 after he became severely ill less than a year after arriving in Jordan. He was diagnosed first with a tick-borne illness, then a second vector-borne disease. He was put down in the US after being flown back for treatment.\n\nThe OIG has recommended more frequent check-ups, written agreements that outline polities, and a plan to address canine retirement and adoption. It did not, however, recommend ending the programme in Jordan \u201cuntil a sustainability plan is in place\u201d.\n\nLast year, a report from the OIG found that dogs sent to Afghanistan were also being mistreated, resulting in \"organised chaos.\"", "description": "A new report from the State Department found that bomb-sniffing dogs sent from the United States to Jordan are not being cared for properly.", "authors": ["Lily Puckett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/17/18/athena-dog.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
