Elijah Cummings last week.\n\nIn the video, the pallbearer, Bobby Rankin, walks down a line and shaking the hands of several lawmakers before ignoring McConnell's hand, much to the apparent surprise of the Kentucky Republican.\n\nRankin, a 64-year-old man from Charlotte, had personal reasons for being angry at McConnell, he told The Washington Post. His brother, Jerry, died from cancer last October after being exposed to contaminated water while serving in the Marines at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.\n\nYou may want to read:After Rand Paul calls Kurds 'ingrates,' Bette Midler brings up sore subject on Twitter\n\nVeterans who were exposed to the water and later developed any of 15 conditions linked to the camp's tainted drinking water \u2014 including the type of cancer Rankin's brother had, multiple myeloma \u2014 could qualify for benefits, including free health care and disability compensation, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nRankin told The Post that his brother did not receive the veterans' benefits he was entitled to before he died. And while Cummings \"reached across party lines trying to help my brother get his military benefits,\" including to McConnell, Rankin said he blamed McConnell in part for his brother's death.\n\n\u201cI could not put my hands in the man\u2019s hand who refused to help somebody who served his country,\u201d Rankin said, later adding, \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it because I was thinking about my brother.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Post, Rankin wasn\u2019t clear about exactly why his brother didn\u2019t receive VA benefits or McConnell\u2019s precise role in Jerry\u2019s battle to get them after his cancer returned in 2016.\n\nMcConnell's spokespeople did not provide a comment when contacted by The Courier Journal.\n\nSince the memorial service, the video of Rankin passing up on McConnell's handshake has gone viral \u2014 inspiring the hashtag \"#thehandshakethatneverwas.\"\n\nBut according to The Washington Post, Rankin said he didn't even see the video until one of the news outlet's reporter's called.\n\n\"I don't know what people are saying,\" Rankin said.\n\nCummings, a Maryland Democrat who represented parts of Baltimore for 23 years in Congress, died Oct. 17 due to health complications. He was 68 years old and was the first black lawmaker to lie in state at the Capitol.\n\nA funeral for Cummings was held Friday morning at the New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore, where he worshiped for nearly 40 years. Former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton were among the dignitaries who spoke during the service.\n\nDuring his remarks at the memorial service, McConnell praised Cummings, who chaired the House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nAlso:McConnell has made money rain on prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Daniel Cameron in attorney general's race\n\n\"He knew there was only one reason why a son of sharecroppers, a child who had literally had to bear the injuries of bigotry and segregation, could graduate from law school and eventually chair a powerful committee in Congress,\" McConnell said. \"Only one reason, because principled leaders had fought to give kids like him a chance.\n\n\"Chairman Cummings made it his life's work to continue that effort. He climbed the ranks here in the Capitol, not because he outgrew his hometown but because he was so committed to it.\"\n\nRankin first met Cummings at a gas station in Baltimore more than 20 years ago, according to The Washington Post. The two struck up a conversation and quickly became friends.\n\n\u201cWhen I carry him to his grave, if I could say something to him, I would say something I said to him many, many times before,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cWhat a mighty, mighty man he is.\u201d\n\nContact Ben Tobin at bjtobin@gannett.com and 502-582-4181 or follow on Twitter @TobinBen.
