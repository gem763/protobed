But they really need respirators", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Firefighters continue to attack a massive wildfire burning in northern California wine country ahead of another major wind event. The blaze has grown to at least 103 square miles, destroying 96 buildings and threatening 80,000 more structures. (Oct. 28) AP, AP\n\nRespirators, yes. Surgical and dust masks, no.\n\nWildfires fueled by drought conditions and high winds are blazing through swaths of real estate around San Francisco and Los Angeles, fouling air quality for residents miles from the flames.\n\nWildfire-driven air quality issues are nothing new to California, and the state Department of Public Health provides advice on which masks will help \u2014 and which ones won't.\n\nFor residents concerned about air quality, the health department advisory stressed that respirators were the way to go.\n\n\"One-strap nuisance dust masks or surgical masks with straps that go around your ears will not protect you from smoke or ash because they are not designed to seal tightly to the face,\" the department warned in an advisory published two years ago.\n\nThat was at a time when a series of hundreds of wildfires burned across the state, including the notorious Tubbs Fire in Sonoma County near San Francisco that killed more than 20 people and destroyed thousands of homes.\n\nA California Street cable car operator and passenger wear breathing masks to protect against smoke from wildfires Monday, Oct. 28, 2019, in San Francisco. (Photo: Eric Risberg, AP)\n\nOn Tuesday, the Kincade Fire in Sonoma County had destroyed more than 115 square miles of vegetation and more than 120 homes and businesses and was only 15% contained. And people in the metro San Francisco area, more than 50 miles away, could smell the smoke.\n\nAnd in Los Angeles, the Getty Fire has burned more than 600 acres, damaged or destroyed more than a dozen homes, and was only 5% contained.\n\nDiablo winds: Fierce winds are fanning the wildfires. What are they?\n\nWhat kind of mask protects against wildfire smoke?\n\nRespirators called \u201cN95\u201d or \u201cP100\u201d were suggested by the department, which said they were easily available in hardware or home improvement stores and even pharmacies. The disposable masks cost about $20.\n\n\"If you must be outside for extended periods of time in smoky air or in an ash-covered area, you may benefit from using a tight-fitting respirator to reduce your exposure,\" the advisory said. \"If you are experiencing adverse effects from breathing in a smoky environment, even indoors, you may benefit from using a tight-fitting respirator.\"\n\nGetty Fire: Fire rages around famous California Getty museum, but priceless art is staying put\n\nBut the department also cites risks, saying a respirator can make it harder to breathe and suggesting that anyone with heart or lung problems consult their doctor before using one.\n\nWearing a respirator if you are physically active can increase the risk of heat-related illness, so anyone working with one should take regular breaks. And respirators do not come in sizes \"suitable for children,\" the advisory says, and since they would not fit well enough to provide a tight face seal, they would not be effective at reducing exposure.\n\n\"The most effective way to protect yourself during wildfire emergencies is to stay indoors or limit your time outdoors when there is smoke in the air,\" the advisory says. \"By limiting your exposure in this way, you may not need to wear a respirator.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/29/getty-kincade-fire-california-air-quality-respirators-surgical-masks/4095000002/", "description": "What kind of mask do you need for wildfire smoke?
