Indochino just opened its 50th showroom in two years. The newest one is in Washington\u2019s Georgetown neighbourhood, among the most popular places to spend money in one of the U.S.\u2019s richest metropolitan areas.\n\nDrew Green, the chief executive, says his closely held company\u2019s compound annual rate of return was almost 50 per cent between 2015 and 2019, and that he\u2019s booked profits for three years in a row. That\u2019s a good look heading into 2020, as investors appear to be losing their taste for digital companies whose strategy for gaining market share is burning cash. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Bonobos, a competitor of Indochino\u2019s that Walmart Inc. purchased in 2017 for US$310 million, is cutting a few dozen jobs to help narrow losses.\n\nPostmedia Network Canada Corp., which owns the National Post, has a small equity stake in Indochino.\n\n\u201cWe could be growing at 60 per cent or 70 per cent, but for what?\u201d Green said in a telephone interview last week. \u201cI\u2019m trying to build a multi-generational brand that sustains through generations and you\u2019ve got to be cognizant of how you are investing and in the bottom line.\u201d\n\nRestraint could come to be seen as an even wiser strategy if the gloomier predictions about where we\u2019re headed come true.\n\nIn June, the World Bank predicted the global economy would expand 2.6 per cent in 2019, the slowest in three years and poor by historical standards. \u201cWe now expect growth to be even weaker than that, hurt by Brexit, Europe\u2019s recession, and trade uncertainty,\u201d David Malpass, the World Bank\u2019s president, said in a speech at Montreal\u2019s McGill University on Monday.\n\nForecasts of that sort are enough to make the leaders of a retailer with clients in 50 countries take notice. Indochino set up in Australia earlier this year at about the same time the central bank started cutting interest rates to get in front of weaker exports and a rising jobless rate. \u201cThe main domestic uncertainty continues to be the outlook for consumption, with the sustained period of only modest increases in household disposable income continuing to weigh on consumer spending,\u201d Philip Lowe, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, said on Oct. 1 while explaining his latest quarter-point cut, which dropped the benchmark rate to 0.75 per cent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an interesting 18 months,\u201d Green said when I asked him about the economic outlook. \u201cAs a board, we talk about it. We talk about, what if there is a recession in 2020 or 2021, and what steps do we need to take to make sure the business in properly protected. It wasn\u2019t a board topic two years ago, but it is a board topic at this point.\u201d\n\nOne hopes that preparations for a recession will be a cabinet topic as well as soon as a new government is chosen. The election campaign has offered little evidence that the parties have thought much about the possibility, so there will be work to do. \u201cLeaders should be judged not only by how they managed the economy in good times, but also how they plan to respond when the economy is weak,\u201d economists at Bank of Nova Scotia argue in a report published Tuesday.\n\nThe authors, Rebekah Young and Nikita Perevalov, imagine a shock that is beyond Canada\u2019s control, such as an escalation of U.S President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China. Extreme uncertainty would kill demand for exports, which would crush business investment. Canada\u2019s impressive run of hiring would stop and probably reverse. Wage growth would stall and consumer confidence would plunge. When it\u2019s all over, gross domestic product has declined 2.5 per cent over six quarters.\n\nA reader of the news will realize that such a scenario is entirely plausible in the near term. Scotia\u2019s economics team, led by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Perrault, a former Finance and Bank of Canada official, predicts that Canada\u2019s central bank will cut interest rates later this month and again by early next year as insurance against the trade wars.\n\nMonetary policy would be the first response to a recession because it can be deployed with speed. But fiscal stimulus also would be needed. Household debt already is uncomfortably high and would limit the Bank of Canada\u2019s ability to restart the economy on its own. Canada\u2019s recovery from the Great Recession was weaker than it might have been because Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s government was too quick to balance the budget. \u201cThe federal government has a better balance sheet to manage a downturn than households,\u201d Young and Perevalov wrote.\n\nThe Liberals and Conservatives have demonstrated a willingness to leverage the government\u2019s balance sheet, but few of the gimmicky tax cuts and credits they\u2019ve offered voters would do much to offset a recession. Normally, roads and bridges would be an effective way to boost growth, but any new spending would be caught in the bottleneck caused by the Trudeau\u2019s government\u2019s infrastructure program.\n\nYoung and Perevalov suggest measures that would quickly funnel cash to households that would be most likely to spend it, such as a temporary increase to the Canada Child Benefit. A short-term cut to payroll taxes might help avoid mass layoffs. \u201cAn appropriate fiscal response should be timely, targeted, and temporary,\u201d they said.\n\nIt should be stressed that this is contingency planning. Most forecasters, including Scotia, reckon the global economy will push through the headwinds. \u201cI still see on a micro-level, in our business, the consumer being extremely strong,\u201d Green said. But smart companies prepare. Governments, if they\u2019re smart, will start preparing for a downturn too.\n\n\u2022 Email: kcarmichael@nationalpost.com | Twitter: carmichaelkevin", "description": "Kevin Carmichael: The election campaign has offered little evidence that a downturn is even on the radar", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/peace-tower.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
