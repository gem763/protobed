Every agency head across the Commonwealth wants more money into their agency, and every minister wants more money into their departments and their agencies.\"\n\nIn its report, ASIO also flagged that the threat of violence by right-wing extremists was also on the rise.", "description": "The Home Affairs Minister also insists ASIO has enough money to do its job of protecting Australians.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4003%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_5/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5f5361fd5dadaf49316422f9c85db2b001420037", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
