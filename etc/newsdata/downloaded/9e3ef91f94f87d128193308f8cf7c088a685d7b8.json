A male victim I spoke with recently had been told by police to sort it out \u2018like a man\u2019.\n\nIs it any wonder so many people have this attitude when our politicians are just as bad? Last week Attorney General Geoffrey Cox remarked \u2018when did you stop beating your wife?\u2019 in a parliamentary discussion about prorogation.\n\nIt was apparently a \u2018joke\u2019 but the language our politicians use when talking about domestic abuse matters \u2013 it shapes and reflects what society thinks about this issue.\n\nListening to the debate on Wednesday, I was frustrated to hear the term \u2018witness\u2019 used to refer to children living in abuse. It shows that Parliament still doesn\u2019t fully understand. Children don\u2019t witness abuse \u2013 all children living in abusive homes are victims.\n\nI want to make it very clear what domestic abuse is. It is power over somebody over time, using any kind of behaviour to maintain that power. That\u2019s why victims are most at risk when they try to leave, because power is being taken away from the perpetrator, and they\u2019ll do anything to get it back.\n\nI keep reminding the government that the majority of abuse victims never even come into contact with the criminal justice system.\n\nA major positive of the bill is that there will now be one amalgamated offence of domestic abuse because currently domestic abuse isn\u2019t really against the law. It is treated as a series of one-off incidents, committed at different times, rather than a crime in its own right. Charges are often attached to other crimes like GBH, assault or harassment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, I keep reminding the government that the majority of abuse victims never even come into contact with the criminal justice system. Data from the Office of National Statistics for the year ending March 2018 showed that over four in five (83 per cent) of people who suffered partner abuse did not report it to the police.\n\nI sat in Number 10 only last week speaking to ministers, pushing for them to have a trauma-informed response at the heart of policy. This means understanding the effects of trauma on people affected by abuse, focusing on what they have experienced rather than what is physically wrong with them.\n\nI have also spoken about the long-term effects, which include mental illness such as PTSD, difficulty forming healthy relationships, re-victimisation, substance abuse and suicide, among others. As Labour MP Helen Hayes mentioned in the Commons, domestic abuse is the leading cause of homelessness.\n\nThe bill also includes proposals to ban the disgusting practice of perpetrators cross-examining their victim in family courts, which happens shockingly often and surely puts victims off from coming forward.\n\nYet it doesn\u2019t confront the extremely flawed attitude of a \u2018contact at all costs\u2019 approach in the family courts, which puts children in danger. We wouldn\u2019t leave a child with an abusive stranger so why would we leave a child with an abuser just because they are related?\n\nIn fact, it is trauma that happens to children in \u2018caretaker\u2019 relationships that can cause the most long term damage. This is something MPs need to recognise and address.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe seem to forget that children grow up to become adults. The trauma of domestic abuse still exists long after the abuse itself. The Adverse Childhood Experiences study revealed strong evidence that children who have been exposed to abuse in the home are more likely to attempt suicide as adults.\n\nI wonder what would happen if we started to look at what\u2019s going on in a child\u2019s life when concerning behaviours are displayed?\n\nFor the government to really make a long-term difference for our next generation, they need to try and stop the abuse in the first place with early intervention and relationship education in schools, and offer proper emotional and financial support to victims. I\u2019m sad to say this bill \u2013 even if passed \u2013 will not go nearly far enough.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Justice Secretary said he was speaking for \u2018all victims\u2019. We must make sure this is at the centre of our domestic abuse policy. It affects all cultures, all gender identities, all sexual orientations and all economic groups.\n\nAn all-inclusive, zero tolerance approach is the only way we are going to start preventing something that is so destructive.\n\nMORE: French Montana\u2019s new video isn\u2019t \u2018freeing\u2019 Muslim women\n\nMORE: Stop blaming movies like Joker for gun violence\n\nMORE: A year after Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony, she still inspires me to fight for justice", "description": "Domestic violence campaigner Charlie Webster speaks out about the shortcomings of the Bill debated in Parliament this week.", "authors": ["Charlie Webster", "Broadcaster", "Governmental Adviser On Domestic Abuse"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1065580022_1570113327.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
