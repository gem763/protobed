Raging woke warrior De Niro accused of abuse by former employee", "language": "en", "text": "Actor and #Resistance stalwart Robert De Niro allegedly abused, sexually harassed, threatened and underpaid his former personal assistant, according to a lawsuit she filed citing \u201cyears of gender discrimination and harassment.\u201d\n\nGraham Chase Robinson, De Niro\u2019s personal assistant for 11 years, is suing the actor for $12 million, claiming he created a \u201chostile work environment\u201d and subjected her to mental and physical harassment in a discrimination complaint filed Thursday in a federal court.\n\nAlso on rt.com Hollywood\u2019s contribution to world peace: Kick ass while chewing bubblegum\n\nDe Niro made \u201cunwanted physical contact\u201d and sexual comments and underpaid her because of her gender, Robinson claims adding he demeaned her by assigning \u201cstereotypically female duties like housework\u201d and standing by silently while a friend slapped her buttocks. Robinson alleges the movie star De Niro threatened her when she tried to resign and that a lawsuit filed against her by his company Canal Productions is an act of retaliation.\n\nThat suit, filed in state court in August, calls Robinson a \u201cdisloyal employee\u201d and accuses her of \u201crepeatedly and methodically\u201d abusing De Niro\u2019s trust in order to embezzle funds. It was filed \u201cto inhibit her from pursuing her claims, destroy her reputation and obliterate her job prospects,\u201d Robinson\u2019s lawyers claim in a statement provided to Newsweek.\n\nOn top of Viagra jokes and suggestions Robinson use her married male co-worker\u2019s sperm to impregnate herself, De Niro also left her a threatening voicemail, which she included in the court filing. \u201cYou f***ing don\u2019t answer my calls? How dare you! You\u2019re about to be fired. You\u2019re f***ing history,\u201d the \u2018Taxi Driver\u2019 actor snarls in the recording.\n\nWhile De Niro\u2019s on-screen performances in films like \u2018The Godfather\u2019 trilogy and \u2018Wag the Dog\u2019 have been praised by all quarters, his offscreen image has become decidedly partisan, frequently making statements about Hollywood\u2019s favorite punching bag, US President Donald Trump. Accusing politicians backing Trump of \u201cmaking a deal with the devil,\u201d he warned they would be \u201ctainted for the rest of their lives\u201d during an appearance on the Alec Baldwin Show in August.\n\nAlso on rt.com McCarthyism 101: Actors demand \u2018blacklist\u2019 of Trump supporters in Hollywood\n\nDe Niro has also played special counsel Robert Mueller alongside Baldwin on Saturday Night Live\u2019s interminable political skits. And just last week, he repeatedly dropped the f-bomb while ranting about Trump and his supporters on CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources. Calling the president a \u201cgangster\u201d and \u201ccrazy,\u201d he demanded impeachment, stating \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta get him out\u2026This guy should not be president, period.\u201d\n\nDe Niro stayed largely silent as the #MeToo scandal unfolded last year, claiming \u201cI don\u2019t witness that stuff too much\u201d and musing that he must have been \u201cnaive\u201d not to realize how common sexual exploitation was in Hollywood.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
