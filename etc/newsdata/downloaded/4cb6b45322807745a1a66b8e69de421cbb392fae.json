I just wonder why we're not applying data and analytics to understand the value that gets created by an agency's strategic thinking or its creative... and what slice of the incremental value created needs to go back to the agency,\" he said.\n\nA recent ANA report found that more advertisers were warming up to commission-based models over fee-based models. Pollard said he believed that value-based compensation was becoming easier to figure out.\n\nGeneral Mills, the maker of Annie's, Cheerios, and Yoplait, drew fire from some agencies when it launched a creative review and asked agencies to pitch for free and relinquish control of their creative, Adweek reported. He has responded to the criticism.\n\nPollard, who is among other marketers pushing for agencies to have more skin in the game, also said that agencies must work harder to win his trust, admiration, and budget.\n\nRead More: Oreo maker Mondelez's CEO is rejecting ad agencies' normal pricing and pushing for them to have some skin in the game\n\nPollard said he was interested in an agency that would offer outside expertise, come up with breakthrough creative ideas that can generate business, and are grounded in data and analytics. He said marketers like himself would likely use a collection or network of agencies rather than just one.\n\n\"Big ideas, external voice, data and analytics, [turning] insights into action,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter what sort of agency you are. That's what we're looking for.\"\n\nPollard also said his No. 1 frustration with ad agencies today is that they've given up on creativity.\n\n\"We can all knock on a personal door now, and we can get there,\" he said. \"[But] if we can't find something compelling to say, we can't make the sale. And that long-term money doesn't go to brands.\"", "description": "Pollard's comments come on the heels of General Mills launching a creative review earlier this year, which came under fire from some agencies.", "authors": ["Tanya Dua"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d924dea2e22af4d3072b717?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
