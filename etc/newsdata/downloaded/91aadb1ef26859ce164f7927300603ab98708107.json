His latest stark comments follow similar pushback from regulators across Europe, the United States and elsewhere over concerns that the digital currency could undermine the current global financial services industry.\n\n\u201cWe cannot authorize the development of Libra in Europe,\u201d Le Maire told an audience in Paris.\n\nThe French politician also raised concerns that Facebook\u2019s development of Libra could also give the social networking giant undue influence of how its more than two billion users worldwide used the digital currency.\n\n\u201cLibra would substitute itself for national currencies,\u201d he added. \u201cThe privatization of currencies raises the rise of abuse of a dominant position, it raises sovereignty risk, it raises risks for consumers and companies.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear if France\u2019s finance minister has the authority to block Libra's development as the association overseeing the project is based in Switzerland, which is not part of the European Union.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Swiss financial regulator said the proposed digital currency would require a payment system license, as well as being subject to more stringent requirements due to higher risks associated with the project.\n\nIn response, the Libra Association said it was working with Swiss regulators.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mark Scott", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1166464720-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
