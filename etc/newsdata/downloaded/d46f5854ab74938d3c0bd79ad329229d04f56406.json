Then it is sealed. Trailers are filmed until they are on the ferry.\n\n\u201cIn the terminals too there are cameras. Breaking the seal, putting 39 people in a trailer and resealing the trailer without anybody noticing is virtually impossible.\u201d\n\nJoachim Coens, chief executive of Zeebrugge port, also said it was unlikely people were loaded into the container at the Belgian port.\n\nHe told Flemish TV channel VRT: \"A refrigerated container in the port zone is completely sealed. During the check, the seal is examined, as is the licence plate.\n\n\"The vehicle is checked by cameras.\"\n\nThe trailer arrived at Purfleet from Zeebrugge in Belgium at around 12.30am on Wednesday, and the front section came from Northern Ireland via Holyhead in North Wales on Sunday.\n\nThe lorry and trailer left the port at Purfleet shortly after 1.05am and officers were called to the Waterglade Industrial Park on Eastern Avenue in Grays at 1.40am.\n\nRobinson opened the doors to get some paperwork and passed out when he made the gruesome discovery, one witness told the Evening Standard.\n\nTributes have been paid to the 39 victims (Picture: REUTERS/Hannah McKay) More", "description": "It has been suggested that the 39 Chinese migrants were dead before they arrived at Zeebrugge and so died at least 12 hours before they were found.", "authors": ["Ellen Manning"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FzUt6gZ86lfVu059a8VeIA--~B/aD0xOTI5O3c9Mjg4NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/77787170-f705-11e9-bdde-744e1ccca142", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
