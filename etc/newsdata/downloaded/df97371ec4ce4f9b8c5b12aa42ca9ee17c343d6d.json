That policy has been to avoid a military clash with the United States and pursue a measured response to tightening American sanctions.\n\nU.S. and Saudi officials are investigating the sites of the attacks, the oil production facility at Abqaiq and the Khurais oil field.\n\nAccording to U.S. sources, 17 missiles or drones were fired, not the 10 the Houthis claim, and cruise missiles may have been used. Some targets were hit on the west-northwest facing sides, which suggests they were fired from the north, from Iran or Iraq.\n\nBut according to The New York Times, some targets were hit on the west side, pointing away from Iraq or Iraq as the source. But as some projectiles did not explode and fragments of those that did explode are identifiable, establishing the likely source of the attacks should be only a matter of time. It is here that the rubber meets the road.\n\nGiven Pompeo's public accusation that Iran was behind the attack, a Trump meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the U.N. General Assembly's annual gathering next week may be a dead letter.\n\nThe real question now is what do the Americans do when the source of the attack is known and the call for a commensurate response is put directly to our \"locked-and-loaded\" president.\n\nIf the perpetrators were the Houthis, how would Trump respond?\n\nFor the Houthis, who are native to Yemen and whose country has been attacked by the Saudis for four years, would, under the rules of war, seem to be entitled to launch attacks on the country attacking them.\n\nIndeed, Congress has repeatedly sought to have Trump terminate U.S. support of the Saudi war in Yemen.\n\nIf the attack on the Saudi oil field and oil facility at Abqaiq proves to be the work of Shiite militia from inside Iraq, would the United States attack that militia whose numbers in Iraq have been estimated as high as 150,000 fighters, as compared with our 5,000 troops in-country?\n\nWhat about Iran itself?\n\nIf a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday -- shutting down about 6% of world oil production -- imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy.\n\nIn recent decades, the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment. Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors?\n\nBefore Trump orders any strike on Iran, would he go to Congress for authorization for his act of war?\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham is already urging an attack on Iran's oil refineries to \"break the regime's back,\" while Sen. Rand Paul contends that \"there's no reason the superpower of the United States needs to be getting into bombing mainland Iran.\"\n\nDivided again: The War Party is giddy with excitement over the prospect of war with Iran, while the nation does not want another war.\n\nHow we avoid it, however, is becoming difficult to see.\n\nJohn Bolton may be gone from the West Wing, but his soul is marching on.\n\nPatrick J.
