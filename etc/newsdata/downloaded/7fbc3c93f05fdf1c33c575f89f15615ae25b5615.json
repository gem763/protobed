Since then, Santos' solo career has soared, garnering collaborations with the likes of Marc Anthony, Drake, Nicki Minaj and others. All the previous success seems to have led to this specific moment -- a headlining concert at MetLife Stadium.\n\nThe Bronx-born singer will become the first Latin artist to headline the New Jersey stadium during his Sept. 21 show. Santos is no stranger to performing iconic venues, having sold out Yankee Stadium for two nights in a row back in 2014.\n\nET recently spoke with Santos in New York City, where he discussed his upcoming performance at the 80,000-seat venue, his new album, Utopia -- which, to the delight of fans, includes a reunion track with his Aventura bandmates -- the possibility of even more Aventura songs, and his hopes for his legacy.\n\nET: You're the first Latin artist to headline the MetLife Stadium. Has performing at the stadium been on your bucket list forever?\n\nRomeo Santos: I\u2019m super excited. I\u2019m very thrilled, anxious, you know, preparing for a huge night. The tickets took off amazing, so I\u2019m really happy about that. And I\u2019m just preparing like I said. I want it to be a very epic night.\n\nYour album, Utopia, peaked at No. 1 on the U.S. Latin charts.Fans have gone crazy over it. What does that reaction mean to you?\n\nI\u2019m never the type to take any of that for granted and to sit there and say that I\u2019ve debuted at No. 1 with every album, so this has to be the same. No! It\u2019s like starting from scratch. And to be able to debut at No. 1 once again is a blessing.\n\nI really worked hard on this album. I\u2019ve been thinking about this concept for nearly seven years. Since it involved so many different artists, that\u2019s why I never really, like, gave it the priority\u2026 They\u2019re so active where they have so many tours and they\u2019re working on albums themselves. So I just woke up one day and said, \u201cYou know what? I gotta do this. This is the time. I got focus.\u201d I explained to each and every one of them how important this was for the culture, for their careers, for my career. And, you know, the rest is history.\n\nWhat\u2019s at the heart of the album? Who is it dedicated to? What does it mean to you?\n\nIt\u2019s dedicated to true bachata fans, traditional bachata fans. What I did was I recruited every bachata artist that inspired me in the \u201890s and, with each and every one of them, I catered to their style back then. So I got musicians that weren\u2019t even longer active. When I started working on the music and was able to get some of these musicians out in [the Dominican Republic], some of the artists were like, \u201cHow did you get them? I heard he wasn\u2019t even trying to do music anymore!\u201d So it was truly fun. I had a lot of fun working on this.\n\nUtopia features collaborations with several artists including Aventura. Why was it important for you to hit the studio with them and bring everyone back together? How did it come about?\n\nI wanted to kind of, like, tell a story: bachata -- the journey of bachata, the history of bachata. I didn\u2019t want anything to be left out. And I say this respectfully, not to sound arrogant, but I think Aventura has played a huge part in the legacy of our genre, you know, our culture and bachata. So there was a moment for me to once again do music with my brothers, that was definitely this project.\n\nAnd it\u2019s interesting because I didn\u2019t tell them till after the fact. They were literally recording their participation not knowing what they were going to be part of. It was just me being extra cautious. I didn\u2019t want to ruin the surprise. I was very secretive. And once we did the song [\u201cInmortal\u201d] I mixed and mastered everything and just showed them. I said, \u201cThis is what you\u2019re part of.\u201d I took a chance. I knew they weren\u2019t going to be like, \u201cOK, I don\u2019t want to participate.\u201d\n\nWhat was it like getting back in the studio with them? Was it nice to perform together again? I know you guys recently reunited for the Billboard Latin Music Awards.\n\nWith Lenny it was, you know, I\u2019ve already worked on some things with him prior to this Aventura [song]. So it\u2019s always fun working with him. It was super cool working with Mikey and my cousin, Henry. It\u2019s just, like, the chemistry just continues. It never vanished. It never got weak or anything like that. It was, like, our chemistry, not only in the studio, but also on stage that night we performed at the Latin Billboards. We just look at each other and we just have this crazy chemistry that everyone can feel.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The 37-year-old singer will be the first Latino artist to headline MetLife Stadium.", "authors": ["Paige Gawley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/W8i7holPzJV7_5sfBglsqQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/2266cd2b00e463c7a293d02bc2e98134", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
