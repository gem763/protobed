But underscoring the broad swath of concern about Trump\u2019s actions among the Senate GOP caucus, 11 Republican senators voted to nix the declaration.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGOP Sens.

The White House is locked in a burgeoning impeachment battle with Democrats and lawmakers still need to fund the government before Monday to prevent the second shutdown of the year.\n\nDemocrats have seized on the administration\u2019s decision to shift money away from military construction projects as a way to politically box in Republicans by forcing them to decide between breaking with Trump or voting to allow money to be shifted away from projects in their own states.\n\n\u201cThe vote today is the surest and likely the only way to restore funding the president has stolen from our troops and military projects across the country,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerMcCarthy shares 'Stranger Things' parody video criticizing impeachment 2020 Democrats push for gun control action at forum O'Rourke hits Buttigieg over not supporting mandatory gun buybacks: 'It's time to lead' MORE (D-N.Y.) said ahead of the vote.\n\nHe added that if Republicans voted to uphold Trump\u2019s use of his emergency powers they would be setting \"a dangerous precedent that could embolden not just this president but future presidents to ignore congressional authority.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to leapfrog Congress and declare a national emergency came after lawmakers passed a government funding bill that included $1.375 billion for border barriers.\n\nBut the decision has become a perennial headache for the GOP. Under the National Emergencies Act, Democrats can force a vote on ending Trump\u2019s emergency declaration every six months. The Senate previously voted to end it in February, with 12 Republicans voting with Democrats, but the House was unable to override a veto.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a vote the Democrats can insist on. I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s no Republican insisting on taking that vote again,\u201d said Blunt, a member of GOP leadership, referring to the second vote.\n\nUnder a list circulated by the Pentagon, officials are shifting money away from military construction projects in 14 states that have Republican senators to go instead toward the border wall.\n\nSome of those states will be at the heart of the 2020 battle for control of the Senate, including Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina, where GOP Sens.

I would urge my colleagues to vote for border security and vote against Democrats\u2019 resolution,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans who support ending the emergency declaration argue that their decision isn\u2019t about Trump personally but about broader concerns on upholding the separation of powers.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: The question before us is not whether to support or oppose the wall, or to support or oppose the President. Rather, it is: Do we want the Executive Branch \u2014 now or in the future \u2014 to hold a power that the Founders deliberately entrusted to Congress?\u201d GOP Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), a co-sponsor of the resolution, asked earlier this month.\n\nBut Republicans would also likely have sparked fierce backlash from their party\u2019s base if they broke with Trump on the wall, an issue that fires up the president\u2019s core group of supporters.\n\nThey are hoping to backfill the $3.6 billion being diverted to the border as part of the fiscal 2020 funding bills.\n\nDemocrats, however, have pledged to block any effort to replace the money. The Senate has also struggled to get its funding bills off the ground. The military construction and Veterans Affairs bill, which would include the backfilled funds, hasn\u2019t yet been brought up in the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nSen. John Cornyn John CornynCornyn makes waves with tweet about Justice investigating Biden GOP turns furor on media amid impeachment fight Rand Paul: 'We deserve to know' identity of Trump whistleblower MORE (R-Texas), who is up for reelection, said he would vote to uphold the emergency declaration even though it is resulting in military projects in his state losing money.\n\n\u201cSame way I voted last time. How would I square voting differently?\u201d Cornyn asked.\n\nWhen a reporter noted his state was losing money according to the Pentagon list, he added: \u201cthat\u2019s way too parochial.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for McSally and Tillis also confirmed ahead of the vote that they would also support the emergency declaration.\n\n\u201cSenator Tillis will once again be supporting President Trump\u2019s emergency declaration because Democrats refuse to provide the president with the tools and resources he needs to address the crisis at our southern border and keep America safe,\u201d said a spokesperson for Tillis.\n\nDemocrats urged additional Republicans to support the resolution, but were also realistic about their chances of picking up more GOP votes. Critically for Trump, Republicans were able to keep the vote total below 67, the amount needed to override a veto.\n\n\u201cI do remember what happened with one senator who actually put out a column \u2026 saying he was going to vote against this extension of presidential power, 48 hours later he reversed himself,\u201d Durbin said, referring to Tillis. \u201cI don\u2019t know what pressure these Republican senators face \u2026 in questioning the president.\u201d", "description": "The Senate again voted on Wednesday to end President Trump\u2019s emergency declaration on the U.S.-Mexico border wall, paving the way for a veto showdown with the White House.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/borderwall_construction_061819getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
