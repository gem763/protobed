All that the New York Times revealed was that the writer was a \u201csenior official in the Trump administration,\u201d which limits the pool of candidates to a few hundred executive-branch staffers. With the announcement that in November the official will publish a book, A Warning, on their time in the administration, speculation on their identity renewed after a packed year of Trump scandals left the gossip dormant.\n\nUpon the publication of the op-ed last year, there were swift and relatively educated guesses on who may have written the not-so-noble piece. Mike Pence emerged as a candidate owing to the use of the word \u201clodestar,\u201d an unusual choice that the veep has relied on frequently over the years. He even had the betting field in his favor, with 2-to-3 odds on the gambling site MyBookie thanks to the lodestar angle. A Pence op-ed would make sense if, at the time, he was fearing a dismissal from the 2020 ticket, or if he had larger ambitions to oust the president from the top of the ballot. But Pence, along with 29 other administration officials, released a statement claiming he was not the author. And though it\u2019s a year later, the Ukraine scandal reaffirms Pence\u2019s commitment to Trump; once an Evangelical with huge ambitions looks the other way for an Access Hollywood tape, it\u2019s hard to imagine that a little thing like undermining national security would create daylight between him and his boss.\n\nThe lodestar theory could also expose Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, who is also known to have used words featured in the op-ed like \u201csteady state\u201d and \u201cfirst principles.\u201d (The diction \u2014 and the letter\u2019s gushing approval of John McCain \u2014 appears to rule out any member of the Trump family.) What\u2019s more, the author derides Trump\u2019s \u201canti-trade and anti-democratic\u201d impulses, and is proud of the administration\u2019s achievements in \u201ceffective deregulation, historic tax reform, a more robust military and more,\u201d suggesting it could be an Establishment figure like Kudlow.\n\nAt Slate, William Saletan made a strong argument for Ambassador to Russia John Huntsman:\n\nThe article\u2019s themes are classic Huntsman: effusive about conservative policies, blunt about low character. In 2016, he made the same points for and against Trump. The topic that gets the most space and detail in the piece is Huntsman\u2019s current area, Russia. (As Slate\u2019s Fred Kaplan points out, Trump has been circumventing and undermining Huntsman.) The prose, as in Huntsman\u2019s speeches and interviews, is flamboyantly erudite. The tone, like Huntsman\u2019s, is pious. And the article\u2019s stated motive \u2014 \u201cAmericans should know that there are adults in the room\u201d \u2014 matches a letter that Huntsman wrote to the Salt Lake Tribune in July. In the letter, Huntsman, responding to a columnist who thought the ambassador should resign rather than keep working for Trump, explained that public servants such as himself were dutifully attending to the nation\u2019s business.\n\nThe timing of Huntsman\u2019s resignation in September, as he mulls a run for governor in Utah, aligns with his possible authorship as well: close to the pub date in November, but far enough away in Trump time to leave room for multiple scandals to serve as distractions. Whoever it is, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham wasn\u2019t all that impressed on Tuesday: \u201cIt takes a lot of conviction and bravery to write a whole book anonymously.\u201d\n\nWith a 272-page book, compared to a 965-word letter, the likelihood that the author\u2019s speech pattern will be exposed grows by 268 pages or so. As the New York Times notes, forensic author-identification software can match \u201cprose style to other published work\u201d and has unmasked authors \u201cincluding J.K. Rowling, who published mystery novels as Robert Galbraith.\u201d Like other esteemed men and women of letters, such as Elena Ferrante and Dril, the resistance op-ed writer could soon face exposure by publishing A Warning.", "description": "With the announcement that the Trump administration official and writer of the \u201cresistance\u201d op-ed in the New York Times from September would publish a book, A Warning, in November, speculation returned as to who it could be.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/21/trump_cabinet.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
