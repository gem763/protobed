Jordan took the bait, saying he stood by it \u201cin a heartbeat\u201d and adding trolling to his repertoire of talents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going in the trenches. I played against and with all these guys. I\u2019m going with who I know,\u201d he explained. \u201cEvery single night, their responsibility to go out there and represent greatness, every single night.\u201d\n\nNotice he didn\u2019t mention LeBron James. And, as Melvin said, \u201cSteph Curry shouldn\u2019t be offended when he watches this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope not. He\u2019s still a great player,\u201d Jordan said kindly, before delivering a shot with a killer smile. \u201cNot a Hall of Famer yet, though. He\u2019s not. He\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJordan took Melvin for a tour of a pet project, one of two Michael Jordan Family Medical Clinics he has funded in Charlotte, where he is the majority owner of the Hornets. \u201cThe Michael Jordan aspect of things, okay, it is what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat drives me is that I know this clinic is needed within the community and it\u2019s going to provide a certain service.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJordan was famously apolitical during his playing days and he has spoken out more and more, saying \u201cI can no longer stay silent\u201d three years ago after a barrage of shootings of unarmed young black men.\n\n\u201cWhen I was playing, my vision and my tunnel vision was my craft. I was a professional basketball player and I tried to do that the best I could,\u201d he explained to Melvin. \u201cNow I have more time to understand things around me, understand causes, understand issues and problems and commit my voice, my financial support, too.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNot that he\u2019d like a do-over from his playing days. \u201cI never look back and change things, for whatever reason.\u201d\n\nNow, if players want to speak out about social and political issues as James and Curry have done, Jordan is all for that, as a citizen and an owner of an NBA team. \u201cI think it\u2019s great if they understand the causes. If they think their voice matters, great. I support that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJordan declined to discuss the NBA\u2019s recent issues with China, citing his problems in that country over ownership of his name. He did side with college players in light of California\u2019s Pay for Play initiative that would cause athletes to be paid for colleges\u2019 use of their names, images and likenesses. \u201cI think they should be paid some portion of money so that their basic needs are taken care of,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is some complexity there that I think the NCAA is going to have to figure out.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJordan made headlines recently for creating a brand of tequila in partnership with NBA owners Jeanie Buss of the Los Angeles Lakers, Wes Edens of the Milwaukee Bucks, and Emilia Fazzalari and Wyc Grousbeck of the Boston Celtics.\n\n\u201cIf we sell it, we sell it,\u201d he said of the Cinocro brand. \u201cIf not, we\u2019ve still got enough to drink.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRead more NBA coverage from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "His Airness may be a mellowed grandpa, but he's still capable of a little trolling.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nocv9UZWabPev-7uCMNDgNe0hqk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EZIEI6SPBYI6TPNXIT4URTAGAU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
