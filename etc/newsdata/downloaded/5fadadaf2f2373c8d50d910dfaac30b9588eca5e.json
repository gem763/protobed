REUTERS/Hannah McKay/Files\n\nThe City of London, home to global foreign exchange, bonds and fund management operations and to more banks than any other financial centre, faces upheaval as firms decide whether to shift jobs to continental Europe to keep serving customers there after Britain is scheduled to leave the EU in two weeks.\n\nCatherine McGuinness, the political leader of the financial district\u2019s municipal body, warned that the country\u2019s biggest export sector and biggest source of corporate tax has no \u201cGod given right\u201d to global pre-eminence in finance.\n\n\u201cThe announced job moves at the moment are fairly low. We would expect those to go up,\u201d McGuinness said in an interview in a room off the local government\u2019s seat of power in the medieval Guildhall. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the story. This is a moment of high risk for the City.\u201d\n\nSince Britain voted to leave the European Union three years ago, London\u2019s financial services industry has been jolted by the prospect of ending four decades of regulatory integration and losing access to the bloc in one fell swoop later this year.\n\nMcGuinness said business leaders have been frustrated by more three years of uncertainty and worries about some of the political momentum behind leaving with no deal.\n\n\u201cWe need the government to stop messing about and get on with sorting out our long-term future on the basis that will allow us to strike up a harmonious relationship with our EU partners going forward,\u201d she said.\n\nBritain and the EU meet at a summit in Brussels on Thursday in a bid to agree a divorce settlement, otherwise Britain faces asking for an extension, or a disorderly no-deal departure.\n\n\u201cA disorderly Brexit would be a bad thing, and I don\u2019t think anyone views an extension with enthusiasm. We don\u2019t want to see cans kicked down the road,\u201d McGuinness said.\n\nBut given that global banks have no loyalty to anyone, she urged the government to help the City continue recruiting from international talent, build adequate housing and transport, and keep banks competitive after the United States cut taxes.\n\nWhen asked whether she would rather Britain to leave the EU without a deal or a socialist government led by the opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, McGuinness said it was a hard question to answer.\n\n\u201cA destructive exit would be a very bad thing,\u201d she said. \u201cA government of whatever complexion that did just look at the whole needs of the whole economy would be the better solution.\u201d", "description": "Britain's vast financial services industry will lose more jobs to Europe over the coming years because of Brexit, the City of London's policy chief told Reuters, warning people not to be duped by the low number of job moves to the continent so far.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441031225&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0F6", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
