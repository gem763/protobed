They are a much better team than they were four years ago.\"\n\nHandre Pollard is another who remembers how painful that defeat was.\n\n\"Us, as a group and the guys that were part of that in 2015, certainly learned from the mistakes that we made and hopefully we can improve on that going into this playoff series,\" the flyhalf said.\n\n\"But it is not a big focus. We just focus on Japan and playing our best rugby on Sunday and winning, whether it is by one point or whatever, you have just got to win.\"\n\nSouth Africa have won the World Cup twice and so, unlike their opponents who are making their debut in the knockout stage, the Springboks know what it takes to win these big matches.\n\n\"It is not like any other test match. It is playoff time now,\" said Kolisi.\n\n\"We have prepared for a normal test match but us as players know what we need to do and what is needed to be done.\n\n\"So, I don't think anyone needs to tell us this is a big game. We know as players. If you don't know already then you are in the wrong place.\" (Reporting by Jack Tarrant Editing by Christian Radnedge)", "description": "By Jack TarrantTOKYO, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The build-up to Sunday's Rugby World Cup quarter-final between Japan and South Africa has inevitably been dominated...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
