The two, who have spoken about the struggles that they faced because of the different cultures they grew up in, are yet to settle comfortably in South Korea.\n\nDeavan threatens Jihoon that she will leave him\n\nBecause of her dissatisfaction with how Jihoon is handling things, Deavan warned him that he needs to smooth things by getting his own apartment and applying for a job.\n\nIt can be recalled that Jihoon told Deavan that he just quit his job and that he had no income right before she was about to move to Seoul.\n\nThe revelation disappointed Deavan, who sacrificed a lot before she decided to live in a new country with her man. It was important for her to have financial stability because she has her own daughter and a new baby to feed and take care of.\n\nThis is the reason why she had to leave her daughter, Drascilla, with her parents in the United States.\n\nShe had to wait for Jihoon to get a new job so they could settle properly. She also felt uncomfortable sharing a living space with Jihoon\u2019s family in the small apartment that they currently occupy.\n\nIt was when she realized that her husband is not taking their situation seriously that she gave the ultimatum. If he does not straighten things out, she might have to go back to America without him. That came out in the latest episode of the show where we saw them doing a traditional celebration, Screen Rant noted.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news! Click on the topic you interest most.
