But it also reminded of the connective tissue between this Southeast Washington neighborhood, where the Mystics\u2019 new Entertainment and Sports Arena was planted earlier this year, and the game of basketball that has been one of the few things celebrated on this side of the Anacostia River but has been feared to be fraying.\n\nFor just up MLK Boulevard from this new Mystics gym, toward Interstate 295, is a little street named Sumner. For over a generation, it has been home to the most recent of our city\u2019s iconic summer basketball destinations, the outdoor court named after the Barry Farm housing project that backs it. The summer league that plays there is officially known as the Goodman League. Years ago, it came to supplant the Urban Coalition League as the place where D.C. street legends balled with and against D.C. pro legends and others, eliciting the same \u201coooohs\u201d and \u201caaaaahs\u201d from the crowds for every shake-and-bake, off-balance, ice-cold shot as those that serenaded Atkins on Sunday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen the Mystics go to work, even in the WNBA Finals, it\u2019s business casual\n\nBut the same development that the Mystics\u2019 new gym is a part of here is threatening not just the organic basketball at Barry Farm but the very culture of the game of basketball in this city that has come to define it as much as go-go music and mumbo sauce. Barry Farm residents started disappearing the past few years with housing vouchers pushing them to move elsewhere and make room for gentrification. So the basketball court, where go-go music blared and fans heckled and hooted, can\u2019t be far behind.\n\nBut the Mystics seem to have picked up as best they could what the Barry Farm court laid down. And it has appeared reciprocated.\n\n\u201cAs you\u2019ve all witnessed here, the atmosphere in the arena is terrific with the fans and how they\u2019re on top of everybody, and it\u2019s loud,\u201d Mystics Coach-General Manager Mike Thibault said after Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cIt\u2019s given us a home-court advantage we\u2019ve never had, certainly in my seven years in D.C.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUntil this year, the Mystics played downtown in the Wizards\u2019 arena, drawing a crowd that was sparse inside the NBA-sized building. And when the team advanced to the Finals last season, it became nomadic because of events already scheduled downtown. It played at George Mason. And got swept.\n\nThis new arena is just 4,200 seats and is all for the Mystics, save for the NBA G League\u2019s Capital City Go-Go, which plays here during the regular NBA season.\n\n\u201cThe intimate setting is terrific,\u201d Thibault said.\u201d Our players feed off that.\u201d\n\nThe energy was palpable. It helped fuel them Sunday to within two wins of bringing a championship not just to D.C. but to a little-thought-of part of the city. And they did so with style.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAnd then to be able to walk in a building and know that we\u2019re important to somebody, to ownership, to the rest of the organization,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cYou see the Wizards\u2019 players and staff here supporting us, and it makes a big difference. They [the players] know that they\u2019re cared about.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe WNBA season started with big questions. It\u2019s ending with hope from smaller successes.\n\nAnd the players care about the neighborhood to which they have arrived. They know the perception. They don\u2019t want to be part of what is seen as problematic, the displacement of longtime residents.\n\n\u201cIt was big moving into this neighborhood,\u201d Mystics point guard Natasha Cloud said after what was the first WNBA Finals game in this part of town. \u201cI wanted us to be an ally to the community.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCloud was outspoken all season about the gun violence that has plagued this part of the city. She established a section of seats in the new arena for gun-violence survivors to use.\n\nThe team sponsored a back-to-school gift program.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing this year is listening [to people in the community],\u201d Cloud said. \u201cThey breathe it every day. They get ignored.\u201d\n\nBut what the Mystics did here Sunday, and seemed poised all season to finish, was as much for themselves as it was for their new \u2019hood.\n\nAD\n\nKevin B.
