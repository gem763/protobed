You really get to see all the details. And you get to show what you can do.\u201d\n\nOne particularly distinguishing characteristic is the oversize barrel, which delivers the watch\u2019s remarkable 10-day power reserve, indicated by the brand\u2019s patented non-linear gauge at 3 o\u2019clock.\n\nThe Calibre 115 movement. Oris\n\n\u201cNormally, the mainspring is hidden, even in many skeletonized watches, but we felt we had to show it because so much of the story of the watch is in its 10-day power reserve,\u201d Fischli said. Not only can you see the barrel, you can watch the coil of the mainspring tighten as you wind the watch to its maximum energy capacity.\n\nSenior Product Design Engineer Lukas B\u00fchlmann was tasked with propelling the brand\u2019s pilot watches into the next generation. Accordingly, B\u00fchlmann took inspiration from aviation and architecture to come up with a design that would transcend fashion while projecting timeless style.\n\n\u201cThe idea behind the watch started with the movement, and we gave this a strong architectural look,\u201d B\u00fchlmann said in the press materials. \u201cThe skeletonized barrel draws your eye first and then the bridges, and then you start seeing the detail in the wheels. The case is more like a stealth plane. There\u2019s an exciting interplay between the movement and the static elements.\u201d\n\n$7,200 on strap. Oris\n\nB\u00fchlmann and his team also got rid of the Arabic numerals you would typically see on an aviation watch. Other contemporary details, such as the facets on the case, the integrated bracelet, the angular crown protectors, and the design of the bridges complement each other to make a sporty yet technical statement.\n\nUnderscoring that modern aesthetic, the skeletonized bridges are matte grey with sharp, clean edges, instead of traditional beveled borders. The grooved bezel evokes the blades of a turbine while simultaneously echoing the collection\u2019s signature big crown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a conventional pilot\u2019s watch,\u201d B\u00fchlmann said. \u201cBut the aviation DNA is still there in the details. We used titanium for the case, for example, because it\u2019s very light. What really makes this a pilot\u2019s watch is its technical look. Technology is the driving force behind aviation today.\u201d", "description": "The watch offers a window on how a mechanical movement operates", "authors": ["Laurie Kahle"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-104354/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
