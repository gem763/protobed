Some air ambulances in the UK already carry supplies of O-negative blood, which is dubbed the 'universal' type because it can be given to anyone in an emergency. But it's also the rarest, meaning demand far outstrips supply.\n\nThe artificial blood was created by scientists from the National Defense Medical College in the city of Tokorozawa.\n\nThey reported their results in the journal Transfusion.\n\nWHO CAN GIVE BLOOD IN THE UK? Most people can give blood. Donors have to be: Fit and healthy\n\nWeigh between 50kg (7st 12lbs) and 160kg (25st)\n\nAged 17-to-66 Donors can be 70 if they have given blood before, or older if they have donated in the past two years. Men can donate every 12 weeks and women every 16 weeks. Males can give more frequently due to them generally weighing more, which correlates to them having more iron. Giving blood removes iron from the body. This is an essential mineral that helps to give a person strength and energy. A person may be unable to give blood if they: Are undergoing medical or hospital treatment\n\nTake certain medication\n\nHave traveled to 'restricted areas' recently\n\nHave a tattoo or piercing\n\nAre pregnant or recently gave birth\n\nFeel ill\n\nHave cancer\n\nAre receiving blood or an organ transplant Source: NHS Blood and Transplant\n\n'It is difficult to stock a sufficient amount of blood for transfusions in such regions as remote islands,' study author Dr Manabu Kinoshita said.\n\n'The artificial blood will be able to save the lives of people who otherwise could not be saved.'\n\nA serious injury can cause patients to bleed profusely.\n\nA loss of platelets means blood cannot clot fast enough, while falling red blood cells prevents oxygen reaching vital organs.\n\nTo treat this as quickly as possible, hospitals are forced to have large volumes of different blood types on hand.\n\nTo overcome this, the scientists created a 'blood' where platelets and red blood cells are stored in microscopic sacs called liposomes within the liquid.\n\nIt can reportedly be stored at normal temperatures for more than a year.\n\nPlatelets in donor blood only keep for four days if shaken beforehand to prevent them solidifying. And red blood cells start to turn at 20 days even if stored at low temperatures.\n\nWhen the artificial blood was tested on rabbits, no side effects, like clotting, were reported.\n\nIt is unclear exactly how the artificial blood overcomes the issue of a patient's specific blood type.\n\nBlood type is determined by proteins called antibodies and antigens.\n\nAntibodies are in the liquid plasma and make up part of the immune system. Antigens are found on the surface of red blood cells.\n\nThe artificial blood may have been developed to have no antibodies or antigens, making it 'universal'.\n\nReceiving a transfusion of the wrong blood type rarely occurs. For every one million units of blood transfused in the US, the incorrect type is said to be given at most four times, according to UW Health.\n\nThe consequences of the mistake, however, can be life-threatening.", "description": "Scientists from the\u00a0National Defense Medical College in Tokorozawa, Japan, tested the 'blood' on 10 rabbits that were bleeding profusely.
