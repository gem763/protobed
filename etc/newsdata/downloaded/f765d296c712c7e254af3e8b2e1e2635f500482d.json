Tonight, the Dingle matriarch attempted to explain her actions \u2014 but Cain wasn\u2019t interested and, as a result, she ended up departing the village in emotional scenes.\n\nAfter informing Cain that she believed Moira (Natalie J Robb) to be having an affair, Cain set off to seek revenge. However, upon discovering that her daughter-in-law had been sleeping with Nate \u2014 and not Pete (Anthony Quinlan) like she initially believed \u2014 it became apparent that Faith knew more than she was letting on.\n\nAs Cain sought revenge on the young man, he was devastated to learn that Nate was his son, and Faith later confirmed that he was telling the truth. It subsequently came to light that she had intercepted all contact from Nate\u2019s mum Cara \u2014 which is why Cain never knew of Nate\u2019s existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTonight, Faith did everything she could to explain her actions, but the Dingle hard-man wasn\u2019t interested, and berated her over the damage she\u2019d done. Faith hoped Chas (Lucy Pargeter) would back her up, but she stood by her brother.\n\nCain told Faith that either she needed to leave the village or he would, and \u2014 unwilling to cause any more disruption to her son\u2019s life \u2014 Faith agreed to leave.\n\nAt the hospital, Nate wanted nothing to do with her either, so after a heart-to-heart with Eric (Chris Chittell), Faith resolved to move on from the Dales \u2014 for now.\n\nChas, Paddy (Dominic Brunt) and baby Eve bid adieu to Faith \u2014 as did Sarah (Katie Hill) \u2014 before the Dingle matriarch got into a black cab, which headed out of the village.\n\nFaith explained to the cab driver that she\u2019s unsure of where she\u2019s headed, but she\u2019ll decide on the way.\n\nActress Sally confirmed that she\u2019d be leaving Emmerdale earlier this month, and as of yet it\u2019s unknown if she\u2019ll be back. However, Faith has plenty of reasons to return to the village, so let\u2019s hope we haven\u2019t seen the last of the iconic character.\n\nEmmerdale continues Monday 28thOctober at 7pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "With Cain having made his feelings for her known following her betrayal, Faith decided to leave Emmerdale.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Faith-in-Emmerdale-3048_1572028020.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
