The nation's leader has behaved in ways that experts have denounced as unconstitutional. His opposition is livid and calling for his removal, while many in the leader's party slavishly attempt to justify his conduct. The media cannot stop talking about it. The general public hasn't entirely made up its mind, but seem much less up in arms. Overall, in all likelihood, the leader's potential breach of the law will yield no immediate consequences for him.\n\nLaura Beers\n\nNow here's the thing that's truly mind-boggling. This week, that brief, damning summary describes the political reality of two of the world's leading nations, both the United Kingdom and the United States.

Their ruling compelled Johnson to leave the UN climate change summit in New York and fly back to London where he met MPs with defiance, declaring the court's decision wrong and reiterating his determination to \"get Brexit done.\"\n\nRead More", "description": "The US and UK seem locked in a race to the political bottom, says historian (and resident and both countries) Laura Beers, who marvels at the abyss each nation has dug for itself.
