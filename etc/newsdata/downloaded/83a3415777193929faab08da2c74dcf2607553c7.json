She's never met them and has no idea who they are, but she does know they're incapable of owning firearms.\n\nThis is the tweet that set her off:\n\nSituations like this story are why we protect the 2nd Amendment.\n\n\n\nSide note: With universal background checks, I wouldn\u2019t be able to let my friends borrow my handgun when they travel alone like this. We would make felons out of people just for defending themselves. https://t.co/x60mdd1WW1 \u2014 Dan Crenshaw (@DanCrenshawTX) September 4, 2019\n\nAnd her response:\n\nYou are a member of Congress. Why are you \u201clending\u201d guns to people unsupervised who can\u2019t pass a basic background check?\n\n\n\nThe people you\u2019re giving a gun to have likely abused their spouse or have a violent criminal record, & you may not know it.\n\n\n\nWhy on earth would you do that? https://t.co/TQFjcLQebO \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 4, 2019\n\nCrenshaw tried to clarify her position:\n\nJust so I\u2019m clear: you think my friends are domestic abusers/criminals? Seriously that\u2019s your argument? That they can\u2019t pass a background check?\n\n\n\nWrong. People lend guns to friends, esp if they don\u2019t own a gun, for self-defense and hunting purposes.\n\n\n\nThis is America outside NYC. https://t.co/wkWPhfi0JB \u2014 Dan Crenshaw (@DanCrenshawTX) September 4, 2019\n\nNot surprisingly AOC is continuing the left's mantra of guilty until proven innocent, in addition to falsely stereotyping large populations of Americans.\n\nAdditionally, if AOC were a true feminist, she would support women owning and carrying firearms for self-defense. After all, a firearm is the greatest equalizer between men and women.", "description": ".09/04/2019 19:35:07PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/163/fda0581b-9e77-49f3-9681-af924edba00d.png"}
