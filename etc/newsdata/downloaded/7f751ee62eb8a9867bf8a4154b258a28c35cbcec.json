And then his jubilation.\n\nThe Oakland Raiders led 17-0 after a superb first-half showing. They had dominated the Chicago Bears in all three phases, reducing their fabled defense to mistake after mistake.\n\nQuarterback Derek Carr looked superb, completing 12 of 15 for 109 yards. Running back Josh Jacobs had 11 carries for 57 yards and touchdown. Fellow carrier DeAndre Washington had 17 yards and a touchdown from his six carries.\n\nJosh Jacobs scores a late winning touchdown during Sunday's clash between the Oakland Raiders and Chicago Bears\n\nThe new purpose-built Tottenham Hotspur stadium hosted an NFL match for the first time on Sunday evening\n\nThe Chicago Bears and the Oakland Raiders took part in the contest as they played at a new venue for the sport\n\nThere were also sacks by Maxx Crosby, Benson Mayowa and Mo Hurst and an interception by Nicholas Morrow.\n\nThey had dominated possession and first downs. Oakland had the ball for 19minutes and 53 seconds, with 14 first downs to Chicago\u2019s two.\n\nThe first-half had also been a demonstration of just how at home the NFL was in London. The 25th regular season encounter in England took place in Spurs' \u00a31billion ground, which proved a boisterously loud host.\n\nSpurs chairman Daniel Levy watched alongside NFL commissioner Roger Goodell with Tottenham and England striker Harry Kane on the field for the coin toss.\n\nAlso in attendance were cricket World Cup heroes Eoin Morgan and Jonny Bairstow as well as Watford striker Troy Deeney.\n\nDespite a dreadful penalty from guard Richie Incognito moving them out of field goal range in their opening drive - the wayward guard shoved Buster Skrine\u2019s helmet into the turf - Oakland also had the cushion of Daniel Carlson\u2019s field goal before the break.\n\nSo when Oakland received the ball after AJ Tracey\u2019s half-time show, the advice was clear: keep it simple. No mistakes. Carr didn't get the memo. His atrocious pitch to Jacobs was snaffled by former Raider Khalil Mack to put the Bears deep in Oakland territory.\n\nTottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane (right) greets some of the fans watching the match at his club's ground\n\nDaniel Levy (right), one of the key figures behind the development of the new ground, speaks to mayor of London Sadiq Khan\n\nCheerleaders entertain the watching fans at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium during a break in the play on Sunday evening\n\nOakland's Josh Jacobs (28) celebrates after scoring a touchdown during the first half of Sunday evening's clash at the stadium\n\nIt was a gift, and Chicago took full advantage. Running back David Montgomery went over from three yards and the arrears were reduced to ten points after Eddy Pineiro\u2019s extra point. Game on.\n\nIn their next possession, the Bears were third and two on the 41. You sensed this was the game\u2019s key play. Would Daniel step up or would Oakland\u2019s defense deliver?\n\nAfforded time, Daniel found receiver Anthony Miller, the receiver making a sublime catch for a 32-yard gain.\n\nCordarrelle Patterson inched them closer to another score, and Daniel did the rest, finding Robinson with a four-yard touchdown pass.\n\nGiven the chance to steady the ship, Carr did anything but after a miscommunication between the quarterback and Jalen Richard led to another Raiders punt.\n\nCohen made the most of it, evading Oakland\u2019s special teams unit in a serviceable impression of Devin Hester.\n\nDeAndre Washington then managed to score the Raiders' second touchdown during the first half of the encounter\n\nBut the Chicago Bears did manage to cut down the deficit during the second half, with David Montgomery touching down\n\nChicago Bears wide receiver Allen Robinson then managed to score a second touchdown from a Chase Daniel pass\n\nRobinson (12) soon found himself celebrating again as he caught another Daniel pass to put the Bears into the lead\n\nThe shifty do-it-all running back gained 71 yards and the drive was finished off by another touchdown pass from Daniel to Robinson.\n\nStill the Raiders had a chance. Prompted by Trevor Davis\u2019 52-yard punt return, Oakland\u2019s drive was ended after a fumble by Davis on the goalline, which was recovered by Prince Amukamara.\n\nYet Chicago let the Raiders in again. Worley intercepted Daniel\u2019s pass, but the advantage was wiped out by a soft personal foul by Cornelius Lucas III on the quarterback. But still the Raiders had another chance to win the game.\n\nThis time, they took it. Foster Moreau\u2019s reception put Oakland where they needed to be and Jacobs punched over. With less than two minutes on the clock, Daniels threw his second interception of the game, Gareon Conley picking off his weak pass.\n\nWith 1minute and 14 seconds on the clock all Oakland needed to do was stay error free. This time - to Gruden's relief - they managed to do just that.", "description": "PETER CARLINE AT THE TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR STADIUM: You can only imagine Jon Gruden's frustration.
