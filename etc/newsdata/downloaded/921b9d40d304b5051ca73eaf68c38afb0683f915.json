(Image: Nerial,Image: Chance Phillips,Image: Flying Buffalo Games,Image: Bezier Games)\n\nWelcome back to Gaming Shelf, our regular column all about board games and tabletop roleplaying games. This time around, we\u2019ve got a cool campaign from the folks behind Reigns: Game of Thrones, and a design contest to make figures for the classic tabletop game Labyrinth. Plus, a failed Kickstarter campaign for an Evil Dead 2 game gets a free second leg, thanks to some good Samaritans. Check it out!\n\nNews and Releases\n\nA look at the cover of Bargain Quest. (Image: Renegade Games)\n\nBargain Quest Reprint\n\nRenegade Games\u2019 popular fantasy game Bargain Quest is back once again with a second printing. Similar to Sheriff of Nottingham, players in Bargain Quest take on the role of shopkeepers \u2014 in this case, in a generic roleplaying game town that\u2019s filled with monsters.\n\nYour goal is to stock the best goods, and keep away the nastiest pests, to attract the bravest (and richest) heroes to your shop. The expansion, Black Market, should be coming out soon. Renegade Games also released Time Chase, where players have invented time travel and use it to prank people across the timeline (kind of like South Park\u2019s Crank Prank Time Phone, only without K-10 the talking robot dog).\n\nLabyrinth Character Creation Design Contest\n\nMyMiniFactory is partnering up with Ravensburger to host a design contest, where fans can submit custom figures for the classic fantasy game Labyrinth.\n\nFans are asked to pick a theme \u2014 whether it\u2019s something like vampires, robots, or even \u201cCute Animal Babies\u201d \u2014 and make four figures that fit in the theme. Winners will have their custom designs featured on Ravensburger\u2019s website, and will receive royalties of 30 per cent of total sales. Submissions are open until the end of September.\n\nThe games from the now-discontinued Survival Series. (Image: Z-Man Games)\n\nPandemic System\n\nZ-Man Games has announced that any of its board games that use its trademark Pandemic gameplay style will from now on fall under the Pandemic System of games.\n\nThis means games like Reign of Cthulhu, even if it\u2019s technically not about a global pandemic, will now be referred to as a Pandemic System game. This means the company will also be discontinuing the Survival Series system, which includes Pandemic: Iberia, Pandemic: Rising Tide, and Pandemic: Fall of Rome, as it\u2019s been made obsolete. Future reprints of games in that series will now be part of the Pandemic System. The rules of those games, however, aren\u2019t expected to change.\n\nComparing the new and original Tiny Epic Galaxies boxes. (Image: Gamelyn Games)\n\nUltra-Tiny Epic Galaxies\n\nAs a fan of Gamelyn Games\u2019 signature Tiny Epic series of games, I was excited to hear that the company is back with an expanded instalment of Tiny Epic Galaxies \u2014 even if it\u2019s technically in an even tinier box. Ultra-Tiny Epic Galaxies is a reprint of the original game, designed to be even smaller than the previous one for on-the-go gaming.\n\nAs reported by The Gaming Gang, it even comes with a mini-expansion. More game, taking up less space! Ultra-Tiny Epic Galaxies comes out on November 2 and will cost around $22.\n\nHasbro Discontinues Plastic Packaging\n\nHasbro has announced that, starting next year, the toy and board game company will begin phasing out plastic from new product packaging. These include bags, elastic bands, shrink wrap, window sheets and blister packs.\n\nThe company is working on how to redesign its packaging to compensate for the loss of plastic. According to a press release, the goal is to \u201celiminate virtually all plastic in packaging\u201d by the end of 2022.\n\nA look inside Mercenaries, Spies, & Private Eyes. (Image: Flying Buffalo Games)\n\nBundle of Holding: Catalyst Bundle\n\nEarlier this month, Flying Buffalo Games founder Rick Loomis passed away from cancer. This left his family with a series of medical bills that the folks at Bundle of Holding are trying to help with. The company has announced the re-release of the Catalyst Bundle, which features some of Flying Buffalo\u2019s well-known tabletop roleplaying games and supplements.\n\nThese include CityBooks, four Grimtooth\u2019s Traps collections, and the recent Mercenaries, Spies, & Private Eyes. The Catalyst Bundle starts at around $12, and there\u2019s a bonus collection for a larger donation. The family also has a GoFundMe campaign.\n\nExpansions\n\nWho could be lurking inside? (Image: Bezier Games)\n\nOne Night Ultimate Bonus Rules (One Night)\n\nLooking to add some new characters and creatures to your One Night gameplay? Bezier Games has announced One Night Ultimate Bonus Roles, a series of new roles and artefacts that can be used for any games in the One Night series, compiled from the One Night Ultimate Bonus Packs. According to Dice Tower News, it\u2019s set to come out in early October.\n\nTiny Towns: Fortune (Tiny Towns)\n\nAs reported by ICv2, Alderac Entertainment Group is coming out with an expansion to its Tiny Towns game, called Tiny Towns: Fortune \u2014 which, appropriately, introduces money into the game. It will be released on February 22, 2020.\n\nCrowdfunding\n\nReigns: The Council\n\nBased on the popular mobile game, with the equally popular Game of Thrones version, Reigns: The Council is a party game where players take turns as the ruling monarch of the kingdom, while everyone else plays advisors trying to accomplish their own (secret) goals. Anytime a ruler gains or loses too much influence, they\u2019re deposed and the next one is crowned. Reigns: The Council will be on Kickstarter through October 2. The minimum pledge for a copy is $51, and it\u2019s set to ship in May 2020.\n\nWindward\n\nThis beautiful but intense tabletop game pits players against each other as captains on the gaseous planet of Celus. Each captain is working to be the \u201cmaster of the skies\u201d by hunting creatures, harnessing wind power to increase their moves, and even attacking other players to steal goods from them. Windward will be on Kickstarter through September 23. The minimum pledge for a copy is $81, and it\u2019s set to ship in June 2020.\n\nCast Out the Conjurer\n\nIt can be hard to find interesting and unique two-person games, and I\u2019m intrigued by this one. Cast Out the Conjurer is an asymmetrical two-person dueling game where one player is a warlock, and the other is a hunter who\u2019s trying to take them down. Each one has unique card deck at their disposal \u2014 the hunter wields weapons and allies, and the warlock\u2019s got magic and monsters that can be conjured at the drop of a hat.\n\nIt also boasts some pretty cool art that reminds me of Ivan Albright mixed with Ren & Stimpy. Cast Out the Conjurer will be on Kickstarter through September 20. The minimum pledge for a copy is $23, and it\u2019s set to ship in March 2020.\n\nEvil Baby\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love an evil baby? This is a Russian Roulette-style card game where players try to survive the evil machinations of a truly terrifying infant. Basically, whoever\u2019s last standing is the winner. Developer Daniel Hayles said he doesn\u2019t plan on releasing this game in stores and is making it a crowdfunding exclusive for supporters.\n\nEvil Baby will be on Kickstarter through September 22. The minimum pledge for a copy is $22, and it\u2019s set to ship in September.\n\nEvil Dead 2: The Board Game\n\nThis is an interesting campaign, because of how it\u2019s also honouring another crowdfunding campaign. Evil Dead 2: The Board Game, based on the events of the movie, has players fending off Deadites, searching the cabin for Necronomicon pages, watching out for betrayal from the other players, and trying to close the dark portal before it\u2019s too late.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s something else about this Kickstarter, because this isn\u2019t the first time someone\u2019s tried to make a board game from the classic Bruce Campbell film.\n\nBack in 2016, Space Goat Productions held a Kickstarter for a tabletop miniatures game based on Evil Dead 2, which was funded but never delivered.\n\nNow, Jasco Games (which wasn\u2019t involved in the previous version) is promising that anybody who funded the original, unfulfilled game will get a copy of this new one... for just the cost of shipping. That\u2019s an awesome thing to do for the fans, even if it\u2019s not the same game in the end.\n\nEvil Dead 2: The Board Game will be on Kickstarter through September 14. The minimum pledge for a copy is $89 (unless you were a backer of the Space Goat one), and it\u2019s set to be delivered in April 2020.", "description": "Welcome back to Gaming Shelf, our regular column all about board games and tabletop roleplaying games.
