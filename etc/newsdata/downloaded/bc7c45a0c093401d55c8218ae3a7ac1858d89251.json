A school resource officer said the girl should be arrested. Police were called and they detained the girl before later releasing her to her mother.\n\nA school spokesman said it was not the school\u2019s decision to have the girl arrested (Picture: Google Maps)\n\nShe has since been charged with a felony for threatening. Johnson County District Court documents allege that the girl \u2018unlawfully and feloniously communicated a threat to commit violence, with the intent to place another, in fear, or with the intent to cause the evacuation, lock down or disruption in regular, ongoing activities \u2026\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe girl\u2019s grandfather, John Cavanaugh, said: \u2018I think this is something that probably could have been handled in the principal\u2019s office and got completely out of hand.\u2019\n\nShocking moment pilot batters his coworker after they broke up\n\n\u2018She was just mouthing off,\u2019 he continued, adding that she has no access to a real gun and has no intention of hurting any of her classmates.\n\nSchool spokesman David Smith said the school would not comment on the case, but said it was the local police, not the school district, that arrested the girl.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s not our job,\u2019 he said.\n\nMother had to have bits of her feet chopped off after being nicked by scissors at nail sal\n\nSmith also said that simply pointing finger guns at another student might violate the district\u2019s rules against intimidation and bullying.\n\nHe explained: \u2018I might not have anything in my hand but I might be so clear that the individual definitely feels threatened.\u2019\n\nThe girl has a court hearing scheduled with the Juvenile Division of the District Court of Johnson County on Tuesday.", "description": "The girl was reportedly in class at Westbridge Middle School in Overland Park, Missouri on September 18 when the 'threat' led to her arrest.", "authors": ["Jacob Geanous"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89164973_1570644922.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
