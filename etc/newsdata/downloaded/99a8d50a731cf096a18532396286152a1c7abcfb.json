But a few notes later, Rae calmly stopped and told her still-startled audience, \u201cLet\u2019s start this again.\u201d\n\nThe speaker mishap was an unfortunate malfunction, but the elegant opera singer laughed it off, continuing a captivating program that spanned three centuries.\n\nKnown for long phrases with boundless colors, emotions and dynamics, Rae\u2019s coloratura soared effortlessly with a glittery vibrato, especially in the Richard Strauss and Fanny Mendelssohn pieces. But it was Rae\u2019s subdued moments, where her voice shimmered so softly that one could hear the auditorium\u2019s faintest rustle, that commanded attention throughout the concert.\n\nPresented by Vocal Arts DC, Rae and accompanist Ware excelled in five Franz Liszt songs full of drama. Their \u201cBist du\u201d unfolded like an aria between lovers, with Rae exchanging melodies with the piano in moody conversation. In \u201cSix Elizabethan Songs,\u201d by the late American composer Dominick Argento, Rae made the Shakespearean language sound fresh and relevant, from the bereft, foreboding quality of \u201cSleep\u201d and the reflective specter of \u201cDirge\u201d to the staccato joy of a lad in love in \u201cDiaphenia.\u201d\n\nRae and Ware brought their talents to bear in the world premiere of Lowell Liebermann\u2019s \u201cFive Songs on Poems of Jean Starr Untermeyer,\u201d Op. 135. The 20-minute work fit the duo like a glove. Together, they rendered the meandering lines and triplets of the opening \u201cLake Song\u201d as a diaphanous mist over water. In \u201cNew Tributes,\u201d both jived in the syncopated rhythms. Finally, Ware rippled his way across the keyboard in the Ravelean \u201cForget-Me-Nots,\u201d as Rae\u2019s voice ascended above the watery landscape.", "description": "In her D.C. debut, the singer and pianist Jonathan Ware present a captivating program that spans three centuries.", "authors": ["Grace Jean", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
