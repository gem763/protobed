And at a debate on October 30, she had repeatedly refused to give a straight answer when asked whether undocumented immigrants should be able to get driver\u2019s licenses. So when Obama took the stage at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner, he exploited a sense among Iowa Democrats that Clinton lacked political courage, and that a vote for her would reflect their own lack of courage, too. \u201cNot answering questions \u2019cause we are afraid our answers won\u2019t be popular just won\u2019t do,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cTriangulating and poll-driven positions because we\u2019re worried about what Mitt [Romney] or Rudy [Giuliani] might say about us just won\u2019t do. If we are really serious about winning this election, Democrats, we can\u2019t live in fear of losing it.\u201d\n\nThe response was extraordinary. Obama, reported Time magazine, \u201chas found his voice.\u201d The Des Moines Register\u2019s influential political reporter David Yepsen wrote that \u201cshould [Obama] come from behind to win the Iowa caucuses, Saturday\u2019s dinner will be remembered as one of the turning points in his campaign.\u201d By early December, according to Iowa polls, Obama had taken the lead\u2026\n\nStill, there are enough similarities between Obama\u2019s position in the fall of 2007 and Warren\u2019s in the fall of 2019 to see why adopting his \u201cDon\u2019t be scared\u201d message could work. Biden has an even longer record than Clinton of taking positions that make contemporary Democrats cringe. And, like her, he\u2019s relying on Democrats\u2019 belief that he can win a general election\u2014and be a steady hand once in office\u2014to overcome their lack of enthusiasm. In his speech to New Hampshire Democrats, Biden mentioned Donald Trump in his first sentence. \u201cWe cannot and I will not let this man be reelected president of the United States of America\u201d was his biggest applause line. But despite this, according to The New York Times, Biden \u201creceived a polite though not raucous reception.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Peter Beinart", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Warren-Asks-Voters-Choose-Hope"], "top_image": ""}
