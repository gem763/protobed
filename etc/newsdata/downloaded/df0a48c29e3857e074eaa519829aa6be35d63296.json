Several of the insurgents portray themselves as heirs to President Trump\u2019s outsider approach to politics, though Mr. Trump has in many cases endorsed their opponents.\n\nRepublicans hold 53 seats in the Senate, meaning Democrats could control the Senate after next year by winning a net of three seats if they won the White House and had a Democratic vice president, or four if Mr. Trump won re-election. Democrats face their own competitive Senate primaries, with candidates in some states criticizing the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee\u2019s decision to endorse in the races.\n\n\u201cThe only way Democrats get a Senate majority is by winning in a state like Alabama or Kansas,\u201d said David Kensinger, a Republican political operative based in Kansas. \u201cIf we nominate loser candidates in places like Alabama and Kansas, there\u2019s every chance we lose the Senate majority.\u201d\n\nEven if Republicans successfully ensure the victory of their favored candidates, primaries risk draining campaign resources and exposing candidates to months of criticism ahead of competitive general-election races.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think Republicans will be able to keep control of the Senate in the 2020 elections? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nFacing a largely self-funded primary challenger, Sen. Thom Tillis (R., N.C.) began a $2.2 million statewide advertising campaign last week that will last through the primary election. As of the end of June, Mr. Tillis had roughly $4.4 million on hand.\n\nGarland Tucker, the businessman who is challenging Mr. Tillis, has run advertisements attacking various positions Mr. Tillis has taken as insufficiently supportive of the president.\n\nSen.

To Democrats, a rush to embrace the president is a potential boon. Even though Mr. Trump won North Carolina in 2016, Democrats see tying Mr. Tillis to Mr. Trump as a way to blunt his performance in the state\u2019s rapidly growing suburbs where the president in unpopular. Republicans expect Mr. Tillis to be closely associated with Mr. Trump, who will be on the ballot in 2020, no matter what.\n\nCarter Wrenn, a North Carolina political consultant working for Mr. Tucker, said that Mr. Tucker, as a political neophyte, would be a stronger candidate in the general election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what everyone in Washington will tell you: \u2018Oh, Lord, don\u2019t have a primary, it will hurt us in the general election,\u2019\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Wrenn. \u201cThis is a case where a primary will help them in the general election.\u201d\n\nHow much money primary candidates can personally dedicate or raise for the race will determine the severity of the challenge for Senate Republicans. Mr. Tucker had lent his campaign $700,000 by the end of June, and the campaign is hoping to begin fundraising more now that he has raised his profile.\n\nKris Kobach, who is running in the GOP primary to succeed retiring Sen. Pat Roberts in Kansas, held a fundraiser last week with Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel and Ann Coulter, a conservative media personality. Mr. Kobach, after winning Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement in the primary, lost the Kansas gubernatorial race in 2018 to Democrat Laura Kelly, a warning sign for Republicans wary of another upset in the conservative state in 2020.\n\nSenate Republicans have encouraged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to run for the Senate seat, and internal GOP polling has shown Mr. Kobach, who as Kansas secretary of state was known for his hard-line views on illegal immigration and support for strict voter laws, trailing a Democrat by 10 points in the race.\n\nMr. Kobach, who was endorsed by the president in his failed 2018 gubernatorial run, and his team dispute that reading of a potential 2020 race.\n\n\u201cOur models show us winning the general election by a significant margin,\u201d said Steve Drake, Mr. Kobach\u2019s Senate campaign manager.\n\nMeanwhile, in Arizona, Phoenix-area businessman Daniel McCarthy recently said he was challenging Sen. Martha McSally, who lost to Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema in 2018 before she was appointed to an open seat.\n\nRelated Video Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said in late August he will run for U.S. Senate after dropping his 2020 presidential bid. WSJ's Gerald. F Seib explains why that\u2019s significant for the battle for control of the Senate on the horizon. Photo: AP\n\nMr. McCarthy\u2019s campaign, which he has indicated will attack Ms. McSally as an inauthentic conservative, may pose a familiar challenge ahead of a general-election race against former astronaut Mark Kelly, the presumptive Democratic nominee. According to an internal memo prepared by the McSally campaign last year, a competitive primary against established conservatives like the now-chairman of the Arizona GOP hamstrung the campaign\u2019s odds in the general election.\n\nMr. Trump publicly endorsed Ms. McSally in June.\n\nIn the Alabama race, national Republicans are seeking to prevent another nomination of Roy Moore, who lost a special election in late 2017 after allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, which Mr. Moore denied. Mr. Moore, who beat Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsed candidate in 2017 before winning the president\u2019s endorsement in the general election, is trailing several other candidates in public polling.\n\nBut as Republicans contain the political bushfires created by the primary candidacies, Mr. Trump\u2019s own history of railing against the party hierarchy could inspire more Republicans to run without an official blessing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just filling a vacuum for the conservative outsider in Arizona,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.\n\n\u2014Lindsay Wise contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com", "description": "A crop of conservative Republicans running in Senate primary campaigns is complicating the GOP\u2019s attempt to maintain control of the chamber in 2020.", "authors": ["Andrew Duehren", "Andrew.Duehren Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109678/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
