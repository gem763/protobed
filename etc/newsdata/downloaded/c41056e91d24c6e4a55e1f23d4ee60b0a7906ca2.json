Some of them are the loudest lobbyists.\"\n\nThe comments come after Incitec Pivot chief executive Jeanne Johns at Wednesday's energy summit called on Prime Minister Scott Morrison to take into account the fate of \"quiet Australians\" at risk from \"businesses destroyed and jobs heading overseas\".\n\nThe pressure comes amid a trigger point for the Australian domestic gas security mechanism.\n\nMr Kavonic said when the ADGSM was introduced it had a review period that was designed to remove it; now, it has been toughened up.\n\n\"So I think that slippery slope towards price controls we're already on it, it's just opaque,\" he said.\n\nThere was unanimous agreement that while some manufacturing industries deserved some form of government support, moves to heavily regulate prices would deter investment in new supply.\n\nAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims ignited a debate in mid-June about an appropriate price for east coast gas by saying he saw \"no reason\" why it couldn't be acquired for $7 a gigajoule.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I do have sympathy for these gas buyers but a regulated gas price is the worst outcome for them,\" said MST Marquee analyst Mark Samter.\n\n\"It's not the job of the upstream industry to subsidise that.\"\n\nHe said that \"oil and gas needs someone to take risk and deploy a lot of capital\" and they wont invest new capital into projects if the returns are not there.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Mark Busuttil said a major issue was that many industrial gas users had been caught unprepared by the speed of the move in gas prices.\n\n\"The issue around commodity price movements is not in absolute price but the speed of change,\" Mr Busuttil said.\n\n\"We've seen a very fast change, an upward movement in gas prices \u2013 the speed of change has caused the problem rather than the absolute price.\n\n\"I think the reality is that people have to get used to higher energy prices and manufacturing companies need to find ways to reconfigure their businesses.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe analysts were also asked about the outlook for liquefied natural gas prices, which have fallen dramatically over the past couple of years as more supply has been added to the global market as the US has started to export the fuel.\n\nNicholas Browne, Wood Mackenzie's director of Asian gas and LNG research, saw little respite for prices in the short term.\n\n\"Supply keeps on coming and that's suppressing LNG prices and energy buyers are reacting to that,\" Mr Browne said.\n\n\"We don't think they've bottomed yet. We think next year will be even lower and potentially this oversupply of LNG will last into 2021.\n\n\"The east coast is part of the global market and now we're seeing the other side, seeing that it is a cyclical business.\"", "description": "Leading energy analysts warned lobbying by 'rent-seeking' gas buyers raised the risk of government intervention which would threaten investment in new supply.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_2.2156%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9f09d381cd82b8ca559919ab28122172fab25841", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
