Petition calls for Oxford English Dictionary to remove sexist terms for women", "language": "en", "text": "A petition that now has nearly 30,000 signatures and counting on Change.org was started by a simple online search.\n\nMaria Beatrice Giovanardi, a London-based communications and marketing expert, typed the word \u201cwoman\u201d into a search engine earlier this summer while looking up information on women\u2019s earnings.\n\nShe said she was bombarded with results for synonymous of woman that included words like bitch, piece, bit, mare, baggage, wench, petticoat, frail and biddy.\n\n\u201cI was like, 'What\u2019s going on? Why are these the synonyms?,\u201d Giovanardi, 28, told \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see myself like this as a woman.\n\n\u201cMy girlfriends don\u2019t speak like this so it\u2019s a man\u2019s point of view,\u201d she recalled thinking.\n\nGiovanardi learned the information about the word \"woman\" she saw online came from content produced by Oxford University Press, a department of the University of Oxford in the U.K. that also produces the Oxford English Dictionary (OED).\n\nAs Giovanardi looked further into it, she saw more examples of what she described as sexist language, including using sentences like these as examples alongside the definition of women: \"\u2018One of his sophisticated London women\"; \"Don't be daft, woman!\": and \"he wondered whether Billy had his woman with him.\"\n\n\"If you look up 'man' you see sentences of what men can be doing as individuals, while with women you see sentences of women as an oppressed group, not as individuals,\" she said. \"Their goal is to portray language but this has a very judgmental bias.\"\n\nGiovanardi took action by starting the Change.org petition titled, \"Change Oxford Dictionary\u2019s Sexist Definition of \u2018Woman.'\"\n\nMaria Beatrice Giovanardi\n\nSince June, the petition has drawn 29,926 signatures and counting.\n\n\"One of our goals was to have as many signatures as the Oxford student body, which is around 24,000 students, so we achieved that goal,\" she said. \"But the more pressure the better so we hope to get more and more.\"\n\nThe petition has already caught the attention of the Oxford University Press, which dedicated a blog post to responding to the petition.\n\nThe post specifies that the content around women called out by the petition comes from the Oxford Thesaurus of English and the Oxford Dictionary of English, which \"aim to cover contemporary English usage and are accessible online in a variety of formats.\"\n\nMaria Beatrice Giovanardi\n\n\"These texts are based on the methodologies of descriptive, corpus-based lexicography, meaning that editors analyse large quantities of evidence from real-life use to determine the meanings of words,\" the post explains in part. \"If there is evidence of an offensive or derogatory word or meaning being widely used in English, it will not be excluded from the dictionary solely on the grounds that it is offensive or derogatory.\"\n\nOxford University Press also told \"GMA\" in a statement Thursday: \"Our dictionaries strive to reflect, rather than dictate, how language is used. This is achieved by using an evidence-based approach, drawing on vast collections of written English from books, magazines, journals, and other digital sources.\"\n\n\"Our editors analyse these collections to determine how real people use English in their daily lives,\" the statement read. \"In cases where words or senses are considered offensive, they are clearly labelled as such.\"\n\nGiovanardi's petition definitely started a conversation, which is what she told \"GMA\" was one of her goals.\n\nOne woman, who identifies herself as a feminist and a linguist, took to Twitter to explain why she didn't sign the petition.\n\n\"Lobbying dictionaries to make their definitions fit your political preferences is misguided,\" she wrote.\n\nThis was actually a pretty throwaway suggestion at the end of a long list of other demands. But even if it hadn\u2019t been, the anger about it is misplaced. Lobbying dictionaries to make their definitions fit your political preferences is misguided\u2014(which is why I didn\u2019t sign)/2 \u2014 Debbie Cameron (@wordspinster) September 18, 2019\n\nGiovanardi said she plans to keep up the \"pressure\" with her petition because, for her, Oxford University's reply was not enough.\n\n\"Our point is that sexism against someone is not acceptable and it is not okay to have definitions like these about women,\" she said. \"We also want them to remove the sentences that denote women being the property of men, and there\u2019s a lot of them,and make it more inclusive.\"\n\nAnd even people who may not sign the petition should walk away from the debate asking themselves questions, according to Giovanardi.\n\n\"I hope people ask themselves if are we doing enough to patrol sexism and see how widespread it is and ask if we are we taking it seriously enough,\" she said. \"Because it\u2019s very embedded in every part of society.\"", "description": "Maria Beatrice Giovanardi, 28, started a Change.org petition after an online search.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/dictionary-1-ht-er-190919_hpMain_v4x3_16x9_608.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
