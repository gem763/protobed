REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\n\nThe Geneva body said it would publish at 4 p.m. local time (1400 GMT) its decision on a U.S. request to impose up to $11.2 billion in tariffs on European Union goods, but people close to the case expect WTO arbiters to award about two-thirds of that.\n\nThe WTO has found that both Europe\u2019s Airbus (AIR.PA) and its U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N) received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in the world\u2019s largest corporate trade dispute, a legal marathon dating back to 2004.\n\nThe cases are expected to lead to tit-for-tat tariffs, beginning with the U.S. measures, deepening transatlantic trade tensions and posing new problems for businesses and markets already roiled by a trade war between Washington and Beijing.\n\nA three-person WTO arbitration tribunal is expected to announce that the United States suffered harm equivalent to roughly $7.5 billion a year from discounted European government loans for the Airbus A350 and A380 passenger jets, according to the people close to the case. Such a decision that would allow Washington to target EU goods worth the same amount.\n\nThe focus of nervous global financial markets will then shift to Washington where the U.S. Trade Representative is expected to move quickly to narrow down a preliminary list of goods in line for tariffs, a U.S. source said.\n\nThe agency\u2019s provisional list of products that are eligible to be targeted with tariffs up to 100% covers goods with an annual trade value of $25 billion and ranges from Airbus jets themselves to helicopters, wine, handbags and cheese.\n\nBefore any tariffs can be imposed, the WTO\u2019s Dispute Settlement Body must formally adopt the arbiters\u2019 report in a process expected to take between 10 days and 4 weeks.\n\nIts next scheduled meeting is on Oct. 28, but Washington could request a special meeting 10 days after the arbiters\u2019 report is published, suggesting an earliest possible final nod on Oct. 12.\n\nThe WTO\u2019s decision on EU retaliation rights related to Boeing subsidies is expected early in 2020.\n\nOn Tuesday, the head of Irish budget airlines group Ryanair (RYA.I) urged the United States and EU to pull back from the brink of a tariff war and said neither side\u2019s aviation industry would survive a long dispute.\n\nBut Peter Harrell, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for a New American Security, saw no immediate peace deal.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that there will be a settlement only after both sides have imposed tariffs on each other,\u201d he said.\n\nFRAGILE MARKETS\n\nImporters led by U.S. airlines that buy Airbus jets have urged Washington to be selective when choosing industries to hit in order to avoid causing collateral damage to the U.S. economy.\n\nSigns that the record corporate trade dispute involving Airbus and Boeing - the largest case ever handled by the WTO - is reaching a climax after years of arcane headlines and thousands of pages of rulings have weighed on European shares.\n\nOn Wednesday, European stocks were already sharply lower ahead of the WTO decision after hitting their lowest in four weeks amid fears about the deteriorating global economy.\n\nSectors most sensitive to global trade and exports from luxury goods to mining companies .SXPP bore the brunt of the sell-off, with Gucci-owner Kering (PRTP.PA) and Hermes (HRMS.PA) down more than 2%. Airbus fell 1%\n\nMakers of high-end handbags and accessories have also been under pressure due to the violent protests in Hong Kong.\n\nThe WTO award in the dispute could fuel rising trade tensions, diplomats say.\n\nEU manufacturers are already facing U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium and a threat from U.S. President Donald Trump to penalise EU cars and car parts. The EU has in turn retaliated.\n\nThe Trump administration has concluded tariffs were effective in bringing China to the negotiating table over trade, and in convincing Japan to open its agricultural market to U.S. products. Washington is unlikely to skip the opportunity to implement tariffs in the case over aircraft subsidies, according to current and former U.S. officials.\n\nAirbus has said this would lead to a \u201close-lose\u201d trade war and has published a video stressing its contribution to the U.S. industry through local assembly plants and 4,000 direct jobs, headlined \u201cTogether, let\u2019s keep American aerospace great\u201d.\n\nSome U.S. airlines have urged the administration not to go ahead with the tariffs, saying they could lead to layoffs.", "description": "The World Trade Organization was poised on Wednesday to open the door to hefty U.S. tariffs on European goods over illegal subsidies for Airbus, pushing a 15-year-old row over support for plane giants to the centre of fraught global trade relations.", "authors": ["Philip Blenkinsop", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436221426&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910SJ"}
