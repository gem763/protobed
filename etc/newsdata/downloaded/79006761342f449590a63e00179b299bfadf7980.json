The update was spotted by Android Police.\n\nThis feature doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal \u2014 and by all means, it shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 but it is a big deal because of just how dumb this process was until now. Previously, if you changed your Wi-Fi password, renamed your Wi-Fi network, or bought a new router and did both, there was no simple way to tell the Nest Protect about your Wi-Fi changes. Your $119 smart smoke detector just wouldn\u2019t connect to the internet.\n\nTo update a Nest Protect with new Wi-Fi info, you had to get on a ladder, remove the smoke detector from your ceiling, scan a QR code on its base that\u2019s normally hidden against the ceiling, fully set it up again inside the app, and then reinstall it on your ceiling.\n\nHow did it take this long?\n\nNeedless to say, that is a stupid amount of work just to update your Wi-Fi password.\n\nI own a Nest Protect, and my unit was unable to connect to the internet for several months earlier this year after I changed my Wi-Fi network\u2019s name. I don\u2019t own a ladder so I couldn\u2019t get back up to it, and even if I did own one, I wouldn\u2019t want to go through the process of getting it properly installed on my ceiling again. It\u2019s a hassle.\n\nAfter a few months, I finally just changed my Wi-Fi network back to its original name so that the Nest could connect again. (To be clear: the Nest Protect still functions as a smoke detector when Wi-Fi is down \u2014 you just lose the features that make it worth owning, like being able to silence the alarm and get low-battery warnings.)\n\nWith a new update that\u2019s rolling out now, there\u2019s finally a feature in the app that lets you update the Nest Protect\u2019s Wi-Fi info from the ground.\n\nUnfortunately, the feature only works on second-generation Nest Protects. If you have an original, a ladder is still required.", "description": "Nest finally lets you change the Wi-Fi information for Nest Protect smoke detectors from the app. This doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal \u2014 and by all means, it shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 but it is a big deal because of just how dumb this process was until now.", "authors": ["Jacob Kastrenakes", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BVxz_T9-BV8Zvz1PQvKcu-mm0j4=/0x104:1024x640/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/3876323/nestprotect-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
