During your stay here, in the shadow of the Langeberg mountains, you\u2019ll enjoy all the wonders of safari game drives to see the Big Five (lions, rhino, elephants, leopards and buffalo) while staying in comfortable lodges and enjoying typical African dinners looking out over the reserve. This afternoon, enjoy your first game drive, then perhaps enjoy a sun-downer beside the authentic Boma (camp fire) before dinner.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://holidays.theguardian.com/tourimg.php?a=img&img=61236e528bf76b39d6b4dfcc153d950a"}
