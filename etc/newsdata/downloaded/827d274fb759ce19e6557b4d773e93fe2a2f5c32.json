These rankings are not fantasy-driven in any way, though I will include nuggets of more abstract fantasy advice here and there inside the individual team write-ups. Who\u2019s hot, who\u2019s not -- that sort of thing. Send any and all complaints to me on Twitter: @drewsilv. Please believe me when I tell you that I do not hate your team.\n\n1. Houston Astros\n\nRecord: 102-54\n\nLast Week: 1\n\nThe Astros clinched their third straight American League West title on Sunday afternoon and have won seven of their last eight games leading into Tuesday night's series opener at Seattle's T-Mobile Park. They will play two games versus the Mariners before traveling to Anaheim for a four-game set against the Angels. This team still has something to play for, as the No. 1 seed in the American League postseason bracket has not been decided. The Yankees are also sitting on 102 wins entering play on Tuesday, though Houston holds the tiebreaker after going 4-3 against New York this season.\n\n2. New York Yankees\n\nRecord: 102-55\n\nLast Week: 2\n\nLuis Severino earned his first win of the year on Sunday against the Blue Jays after allowing just three hits, striking out nine batters, and issuing zero walks over five scoreless frames. He has worked nine shutout innings with 13 strikeouts since being activated from the 60-day injured list last Tuesday. Severino missed the first 24 weeks of the 2019 campaign due to lat and shoulder issues, but the 25-year-old right-hander suddenly looks like a legitimate weapon again for the AL East champs. He could be stretched out to six or seven innings in his final regular-season start Saturday in Texas.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nRecord: 100-56\n\nLast Week: 3\n\nCody Bellinger launched a grand slam on Sunday against the Rockies as the Dodgers earned their 100th win of the 2019 season. Bellinger is now up to 46 home runs and 114 RBI in 151 games played, to go along with a .302/.404/.628 batting line. He looks to be the favorite for National League MVP honors given that Christian Yelich has been out since September 10 with a fractured kneecap. Corey Seager was named the NL Player of the Week for September 16-22 after going 10-for-20 (.500) with two home runs, two doubles, one triple, seven RBI, and five runs scored in a five-game stretch.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Stay ahead of the competition from wire to wire with rankings, customizable projections, trade evaluator, exclusive columns and more in our Season Pass.

Atlanta Braves\n\nRecord: 96-61\n\nLast Week: 4\n\nThe Braves clinched their second consecutive National League East title on Friday night after shutting out the Giants in a 6-0 victory at SunTrust Park in Atlanta. Ronald Acuna belted his 41st home run of the season in the bottom of the fifth inning and then caught the final out in the top of the ninth. With five games to go -- 2 @ KC, 3 vs. NYM -- the 21-year-old phenom is three stolen bases away from recording just the fifth 40-homer, 40-steal season in MLB history. The only four players to accomplish that feat: Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez, and Alfonso Soriano.\n\n5. Minnesota Twins\n\nRecord: 96-60\n\nLast Week: 5\n\nThe Twins just took three of four from the Royals and can clinch the American League Central title as early as Wednesday. They are four games up on the second-place Indians with six games to play, which puts their magic number at three. Nelson Cruz slugged his 400th career home run -- and his 40th home run of the season -- in Sunday afternoon's 12-8 victory over Kansas City. Since returning from a ruptured ECU (extensor carpi ulnaris) tendon in his left wrist on August 19, the 39-year-old slugger is batting .328/.394/.578 with eight home runs and 29 RBI in 29 games.\n\n6. Oakland Athletics\n\nRecord: 94-62\n\nLast Week: 7\n\nThe Athletics are 15-5 in September, after going 17-9 in August, and currently sit 1 1/2 games up on the Rays for the top AL Wild Card spot. If the season ended today, September 24, Oakland would be hosting the Rays in the AL Wild Card Game, though the Indians are just a half-game back of Tampa Bay. It's essentially the only undecided race in the American League. The A's have the easiest final-week schedule of the three teams: 2 @ LAA, 4 @ SEA. Sean Manaea, who pitches Friday at Seattle, has delivered a 1.14 ERA in four starts since returning from major shoulder surgery.\n\n7. St. Louis Cardinals\n\nRecord: 90-67\n\nLast Week: 8\n\nThe Cardinals spent the weekend pulling off their first four-game sweep of the Cubs at Wrigley Field since 1921 and then went to Arizona on Monday and beat the Diamondbacks 9-7 in the opening of a three-game set. They've won six straight and are 3 1/2 games up on the Brewers for first place in the National League Central with five games to play. The legend of Tommy Edman continues to grow. He went 2-for-3 with a long home run, a walk, and three runs scored on Monday night at Chase Field and is slashing .298/.340/.500 through his first 321 major league plate appearances.\n\n8. Tampa Bay Rays\n\nRecord: 93-64\n\nLast Week: 6\n\nRays manager Kevin Cash announced a month ago that Brandon Lowe would not return this season due to lingering shin and quad injuries, but the 25-year-old was activated on Sunday and announced his presence in a big way on Monday, night smashing a 441-foot homer in a 7-4 win over the Red Sox as Tampa Bay took a half-game lead on the Indians for the second American League Wild Card spot. Lowe missed over two months with a deep contusion in his right shin and a strained left quad, but he's been one of the best rookies in baseball this year when healthy with an .871 OPS in 79 games.\n\n9. Cleveland Indians\n\nRecord: 92-64\n\nLast Week: 9\n\nIt was assumed that Jose Ramirez would not return for the remainder of the 2019 regular season when he suffered a fractured hamate bone in his right wrist on August 24, but the star third baseman has made swift progress and is expected to be activated from the injured list ahead of Tuesday night's series opener against the White Sox. Ramirez had a dreadful first half, but he was batting .320 with a 1.045 OPS, 15 home runs, and 45 RBI in a stretch of 46 games leading up to the hamate fracture. Can he help the Tribe secure a spot in the American League Wild Card Game?\n\n10. Milwaukee Brewers\n\nRecord: 86-70\n\nLast Week: 12\n\nThe Brewers just completed a stretch of 18 straight games without an off day, playing the majority of that stretch without reigning National League MVP Christian Yelich, and somehow managed to go 15-3. They are currently 3 1/2 games back of the Cardinals for first place in the NL Central and a half-game back of the Nationals for the top NL Wild Card spot. Drew Pomeranz deserves some praise. Acquired from the Giants at the July 31 trade deadline for infield prospect Mauricio Dubon, the former starter has delivered a 2.35 ERA and 39 strikeouts in 23 innings of work with Milwaukee.\n\n11. Washington Nationals\n\nRecord: 86-69\n\nLast Week: 11\n\nIt's been a rocky September for the Nationals -- their record so far this month is 10-11 -- but they earned a 7-2 win over the Phillies on Monday and are a half-game up on the Brewers for the top National League Wild Card spot entering play on Tuesday. Anthony Rendon drove in two runs in that victory versus Philadelphia and currently leads all major league hitters in RBI with 122. He has slugged a career-high 34 home runs and is sporting a sensational .325/.412/.608 batting line in 624 total plate appearances. The impending free agent should be a top-three finalist for the NL MVP Award.\n\n12. Chicago Cubs\n\nRecord: 82-74\n\nLast Week: 10\n\nThis time last week, there was still hope that the Cubs might stage a late push for the National League Central crown, but they got swept by the Cardinals in a four-game weekend series at Wrigley Field -- for the first time since 1921 -- and now have little chance of making the playoffs at all. They've lost six straight games, five of them by a margin of one run, and Kris Bryant joined the team's walking wounded on Sunday when he sprained his right ankle on a wet base. The writing is on the wall that this will be the final week of Joe Maddon's tenure as manager on the North Side of Chicago.\n\n13. New York Mets\n\nRecord: 81-75\n\nLast Week: 15\n\nThe Mets fell 8-4 to the lowly Marlins on Monday night and would have to win all five of their remaining games -- and have the Brewers lose all five of theirs -- to have a shot at October. The focus in Queens now turns solely to Pete Alonso and Jacob deGrom, if it wasn't already. Alonso leads all of MLB in home runs with 50 and is two home away from tying Aaron Judge's rookie-season record of 52. With deGrom, it's about padding the NL Cy Young Award resume. He boasts a 2.51 ERA, 0.99 WHIP, and 248/43 K/BB ratio in 197 innings entering his final scheduled start Wednesday versus the Marlins.\n\n14. Boston Red Sox\n\nRecord: 81-75\n\nLast Week: 13\n\nBoston was officially eliminated from postseason contention on Friday night, so we'll have a new World Series champion to crown this October. One player worth highlighting as the Red Sox play out the string is 26-year-old shortstop Xander Bogaerts, who currently boasts career highs in OPS (.920), home runs (32), doubles (51), RBI (110), and runs scored (106) with six games still to play. He signed a six-year, $120 million contract extension this spring that will look nice on Dave Dombrowski's resume as he looks for another front office gig. Bogaerts ranks fourth among all AL position players in fWAR.\n\n15. Philadelphia Phillies\n\nRecord: 79-76\n\nLast Week: 14\n\nThe Phillies have dropped four of their last five games and will likely be eliminated from postseason contention at some point during Tuesday's doubleheader at Nationals Park. J.T. Realmuto sat out of Monday's series opener in Washington -- a 7-2 loss -- and could very well be shut down for what remains of the final week of the regular season due to lingering discomfort in his right knee. Now the Philadelphia front office will get to work on signing the 28-year-old catcher to a long-term contract extension. There is said to be mutual interest. As is stands, Realmuto is scheduled to hit free agency next winter.\n\n16. Arizona Diamondbacks\n\nRecord: 80-77\n\nLast Week: 16\n\nKetel Marte was officially shut down for the season last Friday after being diagnosed with a stress reaction in his lower back, and the D-backs were officially eliminated from postseason contention after their 9-7 loss to the Cardinals on Monday. As for Marte, he wraps up the 2019 campaign with a breakout .329/.389/.592 batting line, 32 home runs, 92 RBI, 10 stolen bases, and 97 runs scored in 144 games played, along with a top-four finish in fWAR among all National League players. He signed a bargain five-year, $24 million contract extension with Arizona in March, back when he was a .263/.324/.389 hitter in parts of four MLB seasons.\n\n17. Texas Rangers\n\nRecord: 75-81\n\nLast Week: 17\n\nThe Rangers slugged five home runs on Sunday afternoon as part of an 8-3 win over the Athletics, but they had dropped their previous seven games and would have to win out over their final six games to avoid their third consecutive losing season. Texas will host the Red Sox for three games on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday before welcoming the Yankees to town for the final-ever series at Globe Life Park in Arlington. Given the schedule, making it to .500 is going to be a very tall task. Look for sweeping changes this winter before the Rangers move into the new Globe Life Field.\n\n18. San Francisco Giants\n\nRecord: 75-81\n\nLast Week: 18\n\nThe Giants avoided a three-game weekend sweep in Atlanta as Logan Webb, Tyler Rogers, and Will Smith combined to throw a five-hit shutout Sunday against a Braves lineup that was missing Ronald Acuna, Josh Donaldson, and Ozzie Albies. San Francisco is 20-28 since the beginning of August, after flirting with Wild Card contention in the first half. Madison Bumgarner is lined up to start Tuesday against the Rockies and Sunday versus the Dodgers -- what will likely be his final two outings in a Giants uniform. The impending free agent has a career-high 3.86 ERA in 200 2/3 innings this year.\n\n19. Cincinnati Reds\n\nRecord: 73-83\n\nLast Week: 19\n\nThe Reds fell 6-3 to the Mets on Sunday afternoon as Trevor Bauer surrendered five earned runs over seven innings while upping his ERA with the Reds to 6.39. The 28-year-old right-hander was acquired from the Indians before the July 31 trade deadline as part of a three-team, seven-player swap and will have to hit a big reset this offseason to prove that deal wise. Bauer is scheduled to become a free agent after the 2020 campaign, and the Reds will probably need another big offseason of outside additions to make a run in the National League Central next year.\n\n20. San Diego Padres\n\nRecord: 70-86\n\nLast Week: 20\n\nSan Diego fired manager Andy Green on Saturday after just under four seasons on the job, during which he oversaw a record of 274-336. He's not to blame for much and should be an attractive candidate for some other dugout gig this winter, but the Padres are headed for big things with Fernando Tatis Jr., Chris Paddack, Manny Machado, and many others, and basically wanted to repackage the brand heading into 2020. It could be the most attractive job on the managerial market this winter, and this winter might feature an opening at Wrigley Field. Rod Barajas, the Padres' bench coach, will serve as interim skipper.\n\n21. Los Angeles Angels\n\nRecord: 70-86\n\nLast Week: 21\n\nIt's been a miserable 2019 for the Angels -- the tragic passing of Tyler Skaggs foremost, and also the early shutdowns of Mike Trout (foot), Shohei Ohtani (knee), and Justin Upton (knee). But they can have a little fun over the final week of the regular season with two games at home against the Athletics, who are hunting for an AL Wild Card spot, and three games at home against the Astros, who are battling the Yankees for the No. 1 seed on the AL side of the playoff bracket. Albert Pujols would probably love to play spoiler while hunting more milestones. He is one RBI back of Cap Anson for fourth on the all-time RBI leaderboard.\n\n22. Chicago White Sox\n\nRecord: 68-87\n\nLast Week: 22\n\nLucas Giolito was shut down for the season last week after suffering a mild right lat strain during a normal between-starts bullpen session. He struck out 12 batters, though he did allow five runs, in what turned out to be his final start September 12 against the Royals and finishes a tremendous breakout year with a 3.41 ERA, 1.06 WHIP, and 228/57 K/BB ratio in 176 2/3 total frames. Chicago has its future ace in the 25-year-old right-hander, and there are other young players on the MLB and MiLB depth charts who look like big-time building blocks. 2020 should be far more interesting on the South Side.\n\n23. Colorado Rockies\n\nRecord: 67-89\n\nLast Week: 23\n\nThe Rockies lost two of three to the Mets last week before suffering the same fate against the Dodgers over the weekend. They will finish up a highly disappointing 2019 season with three games in San Francisco before welcoming the Wild Card-hunting Brewers to Coors Field with the opportunity to play spoiler. It's proving time -- well, beyond proving time -- for the Rockies' five remaining projected starters: Jeff Hoffman (6.71 ERA) @ SF, vs. MIL, Tim Melville (5.40 ERA) @ SF, Kyle Freeland (6.84 ERA) @ SF, Peter Lambert (7.25 ERA) vs. MIL, and Antonio Senzatela (6.90 ERA) vs. MIL.\n\n24. Seattle Mariners\n\nRecord: 66-90\n\nLast Week: 25\n\nMarco Gonzales is scheduled to make his 34th start of 2019 next weekend against the Athletics, and in doing so will become the first Mariners pitcher to start 34 games in a season since Felix Hernandez in 2014. Gonzales held the Orioles to two runs over seven innings Sunday in a loss and currently stands 16-12 with a 4.09 ERA, 1.32 WHIP, and 143/52 K/BB ratio through 196 innings. As for King Felix, he is lined up to pitch Thursday versus the A's in what will almost certainly be his final outing in a Mariners uniform. The impending free agent has struggled to a 6.51 ERA in 66 1/3 frames.\n\n25. Pittsburgh Pirates\n\nRecord: 65-91\n\nLast Week: 24\n\nIs this rock bottom, or can the Pirates keep digging? They've lost nine games in a row, tied for their longest losing streak of the year. And they have been outscored 87-26 -- and out-homered 24-1 -- during those nine straight defeats. It's utterly perplexing to think about now, but this team was hovering right below the .500 mark (44-45) coming out of the All-Star break. The record since is 21-46. Pirates ownership is likely considering changes at manager and general manager this offseason; Clint Hurdle has been with the club for nine years and GM Neal Huntington is on year 12.\n\n26. Toronto Blue Jays\n\nRecord: 64-93\n\nLast Week: 26\n\nLourdes Gurriel was a late scratch from the Blue Jays' lineup on Monday after experiencing internal discomfort, and he later underwent an appendectomy that will force him to miss the final week of the 2019 season. Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Bo Bichette, and Cavan Biggio can all be cornerstones in Toronto, but Gurriel belongs in that conversation too. The 25-year-old from Cuba registered an .869 OPS with 20 home runs, 50 RBI, and 52 runs scored in 84 games this season. He was demoted back to the minors in April after getting off to a slow start but returned with a .919 OPS over his final 299 plate appearances.\n\n27. Kansas City Royals\n\nRecord: 57-100\n\nLast Week: 27\n\nRoyals manager Ned Yost announced via press release on Monday morning that he will retire from baseball following the team's season finale Sunday versus the Twins. Yost goes out as the winningest manager in Royals franchise history and the only skipper to lead the club to consecutive World Series appearances. He won a ring against the Mets in 2015, after falling to the Giants in 2014. Yost, who also managed the Brewers from 2003-2008 before heading to Kansas City in 2010, will finish 32nd all-time in games managed with 2,544 -- three more than Hall of Famer Earl Weaver.\n\n28. Miami Marlins\n\nRecord: 55-101\n\nLast Week: 28\n\nMany assumed that this would be Don Mattingly's final season as the Marlins' manager -- the team is 274-366 in his four years at the helm and has lost 100-plus games this year -- but Derek Jeter and Co. worked out a new two-year extension with Donnie Baseball last week that will come with a significant pay cut. Mattingly's previous deal paid him around $2.8 million annually, and his new salary moving forward will be closer to $2 million, per Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic. Mattingly probably enjoys his life in Miami, and the Fish don't have to burn out a promising young manager as they continue to rebuild.\n\n29. Baltimore Orioles\n\nRecord: 51-106\n\nLast Week: 29\n\nTrey Mancini was named American League Player of the Week for September 16-22 after going 12-for-26 (.462) with two home runs, four doubles, and 10 RBI over a period of six games. It's been a dreadful season in many ways for the Orioles, but the 27-year-old Mancini has been a bright spot with his .286/.358/.530 batting line, 34 home runs, 36 doubles, 93 RBI, and 101 runs scored through 149 games played. Jonathan Villar has also impressed to the tune of an .801 OPS with a career-high 24 home runs in 157 games. He ranks third among all MLB players in stolen bases with 38.\n\n30. Detroit Tigers\n\nRecord: 46-109\n\nLast Week: 30\n\nIn beating the White Sox on Sunday afternoon, by a score of 6-3, the Tigers ensured that they would not become the first team in MLB history to lose 60 home games in a season. So, good on them for that. But they still need to win one of their final three home games this week against the American League Central-leading Twins to avoid tying the 1939 St. Louis Browns' record of 59 home losses. \"Those are not the numbers you want to end up with,\" manager Ron Gardenhire correctly stated Sunday. It's been a miserable year in Detroit, and next year probably isn't going to be much better.", "description": "See who's at the top -- and at the bottom -- in Drew Silva's final MLB Power Rankings of the season.
