'We said there's no chance that's happening. There's no chance we'll even discipline him.'\n\n'The losses have already been substantial,' Silver continued. 'Our games are not back on the air in China as we speak, and we'll see what happens next.'\n\nWhile Silver did say he and the league are willing to accept the financial consequences of angering China, the Commissioner later told TMZ that he hopes to 'reset' the relationship between the NBA and President Xi Jinping's regime.\n\n'I'd hate to see this relationship end over this incident,' Silver told TMZ in New York on Thursday.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver is insisting he never apologized to the Chinese government over Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey's tweet supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, but he does hope to 'reset' the league's relationship with the country\n\nDaryl Morey tweeted in support of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests on October 4\n\nPeople hold the Chinese flag and a protest banner in reference to Morey's October 4 tweet before a preseason exhibition between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets in Shanghai\n\nThe NBA has been under intense scrutiny on both sides of the Pacific since Morey posted a tweet with a graphic reading, 'Fight For Freedom; Stand With Hong Kong,' amid ongoing anti-China demonstrations in the former British colony.\n\nGovernment officials in Beijing objected to an NBA executive supporting political dissent within the country, while several Chinese companies reportedly severed their ties with the league.\n\n'I don't know where we go from here,' Silver told TMZ. 'The financial consequences have been and may continue to be fairly dramatic.'\n\nMeanwhile, in the U.S., Silver and the NBA were criticized for perceived kowtowing to China after the Commissioner's initial statement on the subject - a message that Silver believes was misinterpreted.\n\n'We recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable,' read Silver's first statement following Morey's October 4 tweet.\n\nA typical NBA preseason promotional swing through Shanghai and Shenzhen became something else when Daryl Morey tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protesters while the Lakers were in the air on their 13-hour flight to China. NBA commissioner Adam Silver said he regrets Chinese fans are upset, but would not apologize for Morey's tweet\n\n'While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals' education themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them.'\n\nOn Thursday, Silver said he was 'bothered' that many Americans viewed the statement as an apology to China and an abandonment of Morey.\n\n'It bothered me that in saying we regretted upsetting hundreds of millions of Chinese fans while at the same time supporting Daryl Morey's speech, it bothered me, I'd say, that it was interpreted as an apology to the Chinese government,' Silver told TMZ.\n\n'We certainly didn't apologize to the Chinese government.'\n\n'I felt we're holding the line in a way that many companies haven't been able to in China, meaning there was no discipline of our employee, there was never a suggestion that we weren't supporting him,' Silver added.\n\n'In fact, I spoke out in favor of freedom of expression. Somehow, there was a sense from some people that that was the equivalent of kowtowing to the Chinese government.'\n\nFollowing Morey's tweet, which came before the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets were set to play a pair of preseason exhibitions in China, many of the NBA's signs were removed\n\nWhile speaking at the Time conference, Silver explained that he wasn't trying to make a judgement on the political views of Morey or the protesters.\n\n'Maybe I was trying too hard to be a diplomat,' Silver said. 'I didn't see it as my role as the commissioner of the NBA to weigh in on the substance of the protest.\n\nSilver, who has not spoken with President Donald Trump on the matter, has discussed the issue with former NBA commissioner David Stern (pictured), who is credited with building the league's relationship with China during the 1980s and 1990s\n\nSilver stressed that he hopes to continue the NBA's relationship with China, where league assets are valued at $4 billion, according to Forbes. However, Silver explained, he does not want to limit NBA employees' free speech to do so.\n\n'We do need to reset with the Chinese government and everybody has to establish what the rules of the road are going to be going forward.'\n\nSilver said he has been checking in with Morey periodically to see if the Rockets GM is 'getting through this OK.'\n\nMorey has not spoken to reporters since his October 4 tweet.\n\nSilver, who has not spoken with President Donald Trump on the matter, has discussed the issue with former NBA commissioner David Stern, who is credited with building the league's relationship with China during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nHe has also spoken to Boston Celtics center Enes Kanter, who continues to face retaliation from his native Turkey for supporting a cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime blames for a failed coup attempt.\n\nSilver has also spoken to Boston Celtics center Enes Kanter (pictured), who continues to face retaliation from his native Turkey for supporting a cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime blames for a failed coup attempt\n\nBoston Celtics center Enes Kanter shared his reaction without mentioning James specifically, but rather referencing his own ordeal as political enemy of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in his native country\n\nKanter was indicted by a Turkish court last year over alleged membership of an 'armed terrorist group' after being contacted repeatedly by people close to Gulen. He currently faces four years in a Turkish prison for insulting Erdogan, whom the NBA star has repeatedly referred to as 'The Hitler of our century.'\n\nAfter LeBron James was criticized domestically for calling Morey's tweet 'misinformed,' Kanter wrote a tweet describing everything he has faced for speaking up against Erdogan.\n\n'Haven't seen or talked to my family 5 years,' Kanter wrote. 'Jailed my dad; My siblings can't find jobs; Revoked my passport; International arrest warrant; My family can't leave the country; Got Death Threats everyday; Got attacked, harassed; Tried to kidnap me in Indonesia.\n\n'FREEDOM IS NOT FREE.'\n\nJames, who has been vocal on other issues like racism and police violence, has vast financial interests in China, where many American shoe companies manufacture sneakers. James himself has a lifetime endorsement deal with Nike that is rumored to be worth around $1 billion, his now-former agent hinted to GQ in 2016.\n\nIn fact, James has reportedly visited China for at least 15 consecutive summers.\n\nAdditionally, China is considered the fastest-growing market for Nike. In the most recent fiscal year, its revenue from China jumped 21 percent from the previous year, while overall, sales in China made up 16 percent of Nike's total revenue.", "description": "NBA commissioner Adam Silver says he refused the Chinese government's demands to fire embattled Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey after he tweeted support for protesters in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Alex Raskin Sports News Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/21/19856766-0-image-a-2_1571344793309.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
