Salaries have not kept pace, prompting citizens to blame President Emmerson Mnangagwa's policies for the crisis.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (ZERA) said it had approved an application by Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) to raise the tariff to 162.16 cents ($0.11) from 38.61 cents.\n\nZERA said the tariff rise was necessary after inflation soared - the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says it was about 300 percent in August. Zimbabwe introduced an interim sovereign currency - the Real Time Gross Settlement dollar or Zimdollar - in February which quickly fell prey to black market speculation.\n\nIn an effort to support the Zimdollar, the government in June outlawed the use of foreign currencies in local transactions. But the move failed to curb the Zimdollar's slide.\n\nConsumers seem set for more price increases after the energy regulator said that, starting November, the power utility would index its tariff to the US dollar to enable it \"to recover from inflation and exchange rate changes\".\n\nThe new tariff would allow ZETDC to raise money to repair its generators, as well as pay for imports from South Africa's Eskom and Mozambique which cost $19.5m every month, the regulator said.\n\nHopes that Zimbabwe's economy would quickly rebound under Mnangagwa, who took over after the late Robert Mugabe was deposed in a coup in November 2017, have faded fast as ordinary people grapple with eye-watering inflation that has eroded earnings and savings.\n\nOn Monday, treasury data showed the economy was worse off than initially thought. It is now projected to contract by up to six percent this year due to the power cuts, which have hit mines, industry and homes and an El Nino-induced drought that has left the country needing to import food.\n\nMnangagwa, whom critics accuse of lacking commitment to political reforms and using his predecessor's heavy-handed tactics to stifle dissent, has pleaded for time and patience to bring the economy back from the \"dead.\"", "description": "The country is experiencing its worst economic crisis in a decade, recalling days of hyperinflation under Robert Mugabe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/96fd99c4c96649acaf85cddab45c0a8b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
