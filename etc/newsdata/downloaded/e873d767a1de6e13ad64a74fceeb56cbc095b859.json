She didn\u2019t give details on the firms or when they were approached.\n\nThe city\u2019s reputation was likely tarnished not just by the protests but by what many viewed as the government\u2019s slow response to the crisis.\n\nDays after more than a million people took to the streets in early June, kicking off the protests, Lam suspended an extradition bill that sparked the unrest but refused to formally withdraw it. She caved in this month after the demonstrations escalated, but the promise to ax the bill was deemed too little, too late as protesters widened their demands to include democratic reforms.\n\n\u201cIt would perhaps be not the most cost-effective way to use government resources to launch any campaign to rebuild Hong Kong\u2019s reputation, but sooner or later, we will have to do it because I have every confidence in Hong Kong\u2019s fundamentals,\u201d Lam told a news conference Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe time will come for us to launch a major campaign to restore some of the damage done to Hong Kong\u2019s reputation,\u201d she said.\n\nViolence flared again over the weekend after an unapproved march downtown descended into familiar chaos. Hong Kong\u2019s economy, already reeling from the U.S.-China trade war, is facing its first recession in years, with tourist arrivals plunging and businesses being hit by the unrest.\n\nThe government took out a full-page advertisement in the Australian Financial Review earlier this month, two days after Lam\u2019s announcement that she was formally withdrawing the bill, vowing a peaceful resolution to the conflict amid concerns of possible military intervention by China. It\u2019s the only known overseas effort by the government to assuage international jitters.\n\nLam said the city\u2019s downgrade this week by credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s was \u201cdisappointing\u201d but acknowledged that the continued instability has tarnished international perception of Hong Kong\u2019s financial stability. Moody\u2019s was the second agency to make the move after Fitch Rating.\n\nLam also said that she will begin open dialogues next week with various community groups, including protesters, and that participants can freely express their views.\n\nMany protesters have said the dialogues are meaningless if the government refuses to accept their four other demands - direct elections for the city\u2019s leaders, an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, unconditional release of protesters who have been detained and not labeling the protests as riots.\n\nLam said not all Hong Kong citizens support the protesters\u2019 demands and reiterated that the government cannot condone violence. She said the dialogues are not one-off \u201cgimmicks\u201d but an important first step to resolve grievances over problems such as shortage of affordable housing and lack of jobs that contributed to the unrest.\n\nAlso Tuesday, a subway train derailed during the morning rush hour, sparking rumors that it may have been caused by protesters, some of whom have vandalized subway stations in recent weeks. Transport Secretary Frank Chan urged the public not to speculate as investigations are ongoing. The fire department said eight people were injured, including five who were hospitalized.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said Tuesday that the government had asked international public relations firms to help restore the city's reputation, battered by months of pro-democracy protests, but was rejected.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eileen Ng"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/hong_kong_protests_15456_c0-248-3712-2412_s1770x1032.jpg?973a4d464bebaae9f1b9e7719ff82b8d4193df31", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
