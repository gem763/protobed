But today that synthesis is under attack\u2014from the East by radical Islam (faith without reason) and from within the West itself by aggressive secularism (reason without faith). The stakes are incalculably high.\n\nWe can all see that faith without reason is benighted at best, fanatical and violent at worst. But too many forget that reason, stripped of faith, is subject to its own pathologies. A supposedly autonomous reason easily sinks into fanaticism, stifling dissent as bigoted and irrational and devouring the humane civilization fostered by the integration of reason and faith. The blood-soaked history of the twentieth century attests to the totalitarian forces unleashed by corrupted reason.\n\nBut Samuel Gregg does more than lament the intellectual and spiritual ruin caused by the divorce of reason and faith. He shows that each of these foundational principles corrects the other\u2019s excesses and enhances our comprehension of the truth in a continuous renewal of civilization. By recovering this balance, we can avoid a suicidal winner-take-all conflict between reason and faith and a future that will respect neither.\n\n~ Books will be available for purchase and to be signed by the author. ~\n\nSign up to receive invitations to all public events.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-08/GettyImages-83292879.jpg?itok=DtBDM1Py"}
