The Coast Guard believes all crew members were asleep.\n\nRelated Video A man can be heard saying, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d during a distress call made after a fire broke out on a Southern California dive boat. Officials called off the search for 34 people who are presumed to be dead. Photo: ZUMA Wire\n\nTruth Aquatics, which owns the Conception, declined to comment on the matter.\n\nA lawyer for the company\u2019s owner, Glen Fritzler, didn\u2019t comment on allegations the crew had been sleeping but said in a statement, \u201cWhile we don\u2019t officially know the cause of the fire, we do believe from current evidence and testimonials that it was not caused by the operator, the boat or the crew.\u201d\n\nThe preliminary investigation provides some key details beyond what NTSB officials have already talked about publicly in the days following the blaze.\n\n\u201cInitial interviews of three crew members revealed that no mechanical or electrical issues were reported,\u201d the report said.\n\nOnly a handful of crew, including the captain, escaped. The dive boat caught fire in the middle of the night, trapping the passengers and one crew member, all of whom died. All 34 victims have been recovered, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cInvestigators plan to examine current regulations regarding vessels of this type, year of build, and operation; early-warning and smoke-detection and alarm systems; evacuation routes; training; and current company policies and procedures,\u201d the report said.\n\nInvestigators still don\u2019t know how the fire on the boat began or if the passengers and crew were following safety protocols and best practices. Investigators are trying to determine whether those on board had been given a proper safety briefing and told how they might escape the confined bunk area with its relatively small escape hatches.\n\nNTSB officials and others are also looking into the fire-suppression and smoke-detector systems on board the boat, which was built in 1981 and predates the most-recent regulations for this type of vessel.\n\nOfficials said the most important matter is to investigate perishable evidence, such as eyewitness testimony and physical evidence from the boat itself, a problem since it was sunk under approximately 60 feet of water.\n\nFederal authorities have launched a criminal probe as well.\n\n\u2014Zusha Elinson contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Ben Kesling at benjamin.kesling@wsj.com", "description": "Federal investigators released a preliminary report on the Conception boat fire that killed nearly three dozen people this month off the coast of California and said the entire crew was asleep when the blaze began.", "authors": ["Ben Kesling", "Ben.Kesling Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106769/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
