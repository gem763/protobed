Support among Democrats for the start of impeachment proceedings increased after news related to the charge.\n\nFurther pressuring Wall Street during Tuesday\u2019s session, disappointing consumer confidence data underscored concerns over the economic impact of a prolonged U.S.-China trade war.\n\nStocks briefly pared losses in late-afternoon trading after Trump, in a tweet, said his administration would release a complete transcript of a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that is at the centre of the controversy.\n\nHe said the released transcript would show the call was \u201ctotally appropriate,\u201d that he had not pressured Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, and that there had been no quid pro quo of U.S. aid in exchange for a probe.\n\n\u201cWhat all of that combined is going to do is ensure there is going to be elevated (market) volatility in both directions in the next few days,\u201d said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Cboe volatility index .VIX ended the session near a three-week high. The S&P 500 retail index .SPXRT fell 1.4%, while Amazon.com (AMZN.O) declined 2.4% and was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 142.22 points, or 0.53%, to 26,807.77, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 25.18 points, or 0.84%, to 2,966.6 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 118.84 points, or 1.46%, to 7,993.63.\n\nWall Street\u2019s major indexes lost their footing early, when Trump took a harsh tone about China\u2019s trade practices.\n\nPaul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, said the trade war was likely a bigger issue than possible impeachment proceedings for the market right now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how strong the case is for impeachment, so I don\u2019t know what will happen with that. We react first and think later,\u201d he said.\n\nNike Inc (NKE.N) slipped ahead of the world\u2019s largest sportswear maker\u2019s first-quarter results after the bell. The shares rose about 5% following its results, which beat analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 9, 2019.
