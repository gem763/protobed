Mr Dehbashi had been detained in Australia for 13 months on accusations of circumventing US sanctions on military equipment.\n\nBut Mr Porter dismissed \"speculation\" over the case amid media reports that it could be part of a prisoner swap involving the bloggers.", "description": "Jolie King, a British-Australian travel blogger who was imprisoned in Iran with her fianc\u00e9 on spying charges, has been released from jail.", "authors": ["Jennifer Rigby", "Janet Daley", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon", "Sarah Champion"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/13/TELEMMGLPICT000209174291-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqxE6WYbzRGIq7DYNoS4-zig1vLvhkMtVb21dMmpQBfEs.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
