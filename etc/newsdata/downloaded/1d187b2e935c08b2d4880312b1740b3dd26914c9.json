Villanelle\u2019s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle\u2019s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-they/won\u2019t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.\" BBC/BBC America 2/26 Years and Years \"Years and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.\" BBC 3/26 The Virtues \"Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham\u2019s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\" Dean Rogers/Channel 4 4/26 Good Omens 'Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett\u2019s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.' Amazon Prime 5/26 Line of Duty (BBC) \"Plausibility is a spectrum; Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the individual. The shadowy government forces are elected; the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It\u2019s exhausting work, policing the police.\" BBC 6/26 Our Planet (Netflix) \"The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough\u2019s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can\u2019t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.\" Netflix 7/26 Road to Brexit (BBC) \"The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it\u2019s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don\u2019t understand. Rather, it\u2019s a very clever, very funny, very 'different' parcel of bollocks to Brexit.\" BBC 8/26 Fleabag (BBC) \"While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O\u2019Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.\" BBC/Two Brothers/Luke Varley 9/26 Derry Girls (Channel 4) \"It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man\u2019s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.\" Peter Marley 10/26 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC) \"A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando\u2019s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can\u2019t really add anything to that.\" PA 11/26 Home (Channel 4) \"Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme \u2013 but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he\u2019s stray cat that\u2019s just wandered in.\" Channel 4 12/26 Leaving Neverland (Channel 4) \"Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard.
