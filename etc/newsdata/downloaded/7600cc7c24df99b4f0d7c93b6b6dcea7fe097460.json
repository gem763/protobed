The storm caused widespread flooding in southeastern Texas and parts of Louisiana.\n\nJefferson County spokeswoman Allison Getz said Saturday that 52-year-old Mark Dukaj, of Florida, was found dead Thursday in his stranded pickup truck on Interstate 10 just west of Beaumont, which is near Texas' border with Louisiana. She didn't know where in Florida he lived.\n\nGetz said floodwaters seeped into the pickup, but officials don't believe he drowned. She said investigators believe his death is related to the storm and an autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause.\n\nAuthorities have attributed four other deaths to the storm, including that of a 19-year-old man who was electrocuted while trying to lead his horse to safety through floodwaters.", "description": "The storm caused widespread flooding in southeastern Texas and parts of Louisiana.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/21/abae85a9-61ce-4598-bb90-2f8db30b3b1a/thumbnail/1200x630/df3b6dc6e79e25f498bb4f0a6555dec4/gettyimages-1169603120.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
