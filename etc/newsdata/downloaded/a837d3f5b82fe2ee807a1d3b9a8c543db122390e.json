And they're all fair-skinned, the kind that no amount of sunscreen seems to stave off a sunburn.\n\nBy appearance, they take after their father and his lineage.\n\nSo I'm forgiving when people say, \"They don't look like you at all,\" but a little less forgiving when people confuse me for their nanny.\n\nMy kids are Canadian. By heritage on my side, they're Indian (my Bengali parents immigrated to Canada in 1967). On their dad's side, it's a mix of Scottish, Irish and English.\n\nI tell you this because I spend a lot of time looking at my children and wondering to myself what their skin tone means in 2019... and what it will mean in years to come, as they grow into adults.\n\nEach of them has the ability to \"pass\" as a white person.\n\nPiya Chattopadhyay, her husband Peter Armstrong, and their twin sons (Submitted by Piya Chattopadhyay)\n\nPassing means being assumed to be something that you are not.\n\nAnd it can be a privilege. There are clear benefits when people assume that you're white.\n\nNot having racial taunts hurled at you for the colour of your skin is one obvious example.\n\nBut there are a lot of other times when passing as white can also have its advantages.\n\nFor example, when crossing the border into the United States, James Chaarani \u2013 who's the child of Muslim-Lebanese immigrants, and is himself white passing \u2013 explained on Out in the Open's recent episode \"Come to Pass\":\n\n\"I feel the need to conceal who I am when I'm crossing the U.S border... It's not that I've done anything wrong. I just don't want to be hassled. And it's paid off: I can't remember the last time a border guard gave me any trouble.\"\n\nBut as Chaarani argues, there can also be a cost to passing.\n\n\"Since I'm so inconspicuous, it means I also get access to unfiltered versions of Islamophobia and ethnic hatred,\" he said, \"I see and hear the subtle bigotry that some non-Arab people express amongst themselves, because they think I'm one of them.\"\n\nAnd that's the thing about passing.\n\nIt's a privileged door you can choose to access, but once you walk through it, you can't always predict what will be on the other side.\n\nPiya Chattopadhyay is the host of CBC Radio's Out in the Open.", "description": "Out in the Open host Piya Chattopadhyay's biracial, fair-skinned children have the ability to pass as white.
