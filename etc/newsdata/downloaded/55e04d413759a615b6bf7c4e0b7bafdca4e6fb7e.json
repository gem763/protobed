Only Iranian Ali Daei has scored more international goals, with 109.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nIt remains to be seen how many goals Ronaldo can reach before he retires, but there is no doubt that he will be remembered as one of the most feared attacking players of all time.\n\nHe has scored the majority of his goal at Real Madrid , where he found the net a staggering 450 times in nine seasons at the Bernabeu. He also scored 118 goals early on in his career at Manchester United from 2003 to 2009.\n\nRonaldo also holds a number of other records, such as scoring the highest number of Champions League goals and the most in Real Madrid's illustrious history, while he has also won more caps for Portugal than anyone else and individually has won the joint-most Ballon d'Ors with five, tied with Lionel Messi.\n\n(Image: PAULO NOVAIS/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nThe result against Ukraine means Portugal stay in second place in Group B, just one point above Serbia and eight points behind leaders Ukraine, but they have two relatively kind looking fixtures to go in Lithuania and Luxembourg.\n\nRonaldo will next be in action when Juventus host Bologna in Serie A on Saturday, with the side currently top of the table, one point ahead of title challengers Inter Milan.", "description": "The Juventus star became only the sixth player of all time to reach the landmark after his strike in the 2-1 loss", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Reuters", "Paulo Novais Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20580731.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Euro-2020-Qualifier-Group-B-Ukraine-v-Portugal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
