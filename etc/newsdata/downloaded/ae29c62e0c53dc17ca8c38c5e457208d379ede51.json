But the unprecedented barrage of unproven allegations of corruption from a sitting president\u2014and a cash-strapped campaign that was fourth in fundraising last quarter\u2014left Biden with few alternatives, he told reporters this weekend.\n\n\u201cWhen President Trump went out and got the folks who love me the most\u2014the NRA and the gun manufacturers and the oil companies and the insurance companies\u2014to spend, somewhere in excess, they tell me, ten million dollars on ads\u2026 what happened, I learned after the fact from my folks, there were a lot of people who said we can\u2019t let this stand,\u201d Biden told a gaggle of reporters in North Carolina on Saturday, denying that he had changed his opinion on super PACs as an issue. \u201cThey\u2019re able to do that, I haven\u2019t discouraged them, but I haven\u2019t encouraged it either\u2014I just stayed away, just hands off.\u201d\n\nBiden added that passing a constitutional amendment for public election funding would be \u201cthe single most significant thing we can do\u201d to get money out of politics.\n\nFueled by a Supreme Court ruling in 2010 that legalized unlimited election spending by corporations, super PACs have become taboo in Democratic circles, with most of Biden\u2019s presidential rivals having sworn off assistance from such groups in this cycle. The campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who along with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has gone a step further and sworn off fundraisers entirely in favor of small-dollar donations, has hit Biden for reversing a long-held aversion to super PACs.\n\n\u201cThe former vice president has been unable to generate grassroots support,\u201d Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said after the reversal was announced. \u201cNow his campaign is endorsing an effort to buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations.\u201d\n\nBiden lagged far behind the rest of the top-tier candidates in third-quarter fundraising, raising $15.2 million over three months, and ending the quarter with a mere $9 million in cash on hand. By comparison, Sanders raised $25.3 million, Warren raised $24.6 million, and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised $19.1 million.\n\nAlthough campaigns are forbidden from explicitly coordinating with super PACs, senior staffers and advisers for campaigns often make appearances at super PAC events, and campaigns occasionally drop hours of high-quality b-roll video on YouTube for super PACs to use in campaign ads.\n\nAs recently as last month, Biden\u2019s campaign pointed to the presidential onslaught as evidence that the campaign finance system needed to be reformed.\n\n\u201cThe attacks aimed at this campaign from dark money groups helping Donald Trump spread his outlandish lies and slander have only served as a reminder of the urgent need for campaign finance reform,\u201d national press secretary T.J. Ducklo said in September. \u201cWhich is exactly why since the beginning of this campaign, Biden for president has not and will not welcome the help of super PACs. That goes for those that purport to help him, despite his explicit condemnation of their existence.\u201d\n\nIn his memoir Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose, Biden wrote that had he run for the White House in 2016, he would not have accepted super PAC support, even though \u201cI knew there was big money out there for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI also knew people were sick of it all,\u201d Biden wrote at the time. \u201cRejecting super PAC money wasn't a hardship for me.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
