Guests but not the host mentioned Mrs. Clinton in the other 31 episodes of \u201cHannity,\u201d according to the report.\n\nMatt Gertz, a senior fellow for Media Matters who authored the report, wrote that Mr. Hannity\u2019s \u201cClinton fixation is largely a reflection of his show\u2019s focus on the dizzying conspiracy theory he constructed to defend Trump from the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nFederal intelligence agencies have assessed that the Russian government interfered in the race to elect Mr. Trump over his Democratic opponent, and Mr. Hannity, a conservative commentator and unabashed Trump supporter who has claimed to be his biggest fan at Fox News, has been among the loudest critics on cable news of the subsequent investigation launched by the Department of Justice.\n\nScouring hundreds of episodes of \u201cHannity\u201d for references to Mrs. Clinton revealed \u201ctruly gobsmacking statistics,\u201d Mr. Gertz wrote: Mr. Hannity referenced Mrs. Clinton during 60 consecutive episodes of his Fox News program aired between April and July, during which he mentioned Vice President Mike Pence on just two nights; and the longest Mr. Hannity has gone without mentioning Mrs. Clinton on his Fox News show was a five-episode streak in the spring of 2017.\n\nMr. Hannity did not immediately return a message requesting comment.\n\nMr. Trump recently applauded Mr. Hannity for having the most-watched program on cable news last month, meanwhile.\n\n\u201cHas anyone noticed that the top shows on @foxnews and cable ratings are those that are Fair (or great) to your favorite President, me! Congratulations to @seanhannity for being the number one show on Cable Television,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
