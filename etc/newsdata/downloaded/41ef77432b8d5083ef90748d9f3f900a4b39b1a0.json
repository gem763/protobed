In the ninth edition of \u201cRich States, Poor States,\u201d Utah, North Carolina and North Dakota topped the list, while New Jersey, Vermont and New York found themselves at the bottom.\n\nAn update released Friday points to recent wins in lowering taxes and removing forced unionism policies in the months since the report was released. Last week, Missouri became the 28th state to adopt a right-to-work law, following Kentucky\u2019s passage earlier this year, with New Hampshire seriously considering a similar statute.\n\nRELATED: Missouri becomes 28th right-to-work state\n\nMississippi received high marks in the ALEC update for its \u201cTaxpayer Pay Raise Act,\u201d which reformed the state\u2019s tax system while also promising $415 million in tax relief over the next decade. The changes to state law include the phase-out of the 3 percent personal income tax bracket and the Mississippi franchise tax, as well as the creation of a tax deduction for a portion of the federal self-employment tax.\n\n\u201cWhile some of the benefits of this significant reform will take a few years for taxpayers to feel, the steps Mississippi has taken to make it a more attractive home for businesses are sure to aid in growing the state\u2019s economy,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nNorth Carolina also got high marks for continuing to implement tax reforms that have saved state taxpayers an estimated $2 billion since 2011. The Tar Heel State has jumped in the economic outlook rankings from 26th to second during that span.\n\nThe authors also pointed to Tennessee, where a bipartisan coalition of legislators passed a bill to eliminate a tax that is assessed on all income earned from investments, capital gains and savings. ALEC notes many payers of this tax include \u201chopeful entrepreneurs, working-class families, retirees and soon-to-be retirees who especially depend on their savings and investments for retirement.\u201d This levy, known as the Hall Income Tax, will be phased out over six years.\n\nSome states are headed the other direction. The authors point to Louisiana\u2019s $1.5 billion in tax hikes in 2016, which followed an additional $720 million in taxes approved in 2015, in an effort to shore up a budget shortfall. Meanwhile, employment is tanking, with 18,000 fewer people with jobs in the state in September 2016 compared to 12 months earlier.\n\n\u201cJobs, and therefore taxpayers, are not fleeing Louisiana for lack of taxpayer investment in social programs and infrastructure as some insinuate \u2014 but rather, because the tax burdens for such programs continue to worsen,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, Alaskan taxpayers dodged a big tax increase. Gov. Bill Walker wanted to reinstate the state\u2019s personal income tax, but lawmakers rebuffed his goals. Although the authors commended Walker for pushing fiscal reform in a state with an estimated $4 billion deficit, they said bringing back the personal income tax is not the answer.", "description": "In a\u00a0midterm update of the \u201cRich States, Poor States\u201d measure .09/02/2019 3:01:02AM EST.", "authors": ["Johnny Kampis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/Taxes-300x267.png"}
