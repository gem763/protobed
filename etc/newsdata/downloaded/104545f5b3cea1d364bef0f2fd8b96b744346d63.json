The England wing will collect cap No 50, marking an incredible rise from 2013 rookie to one of the most lethal finishers in the international game. But it could all have been so different if he hadn\u2019t decided against joining his teammates on a late-night drinking session.\n\nThe 29-year-old made his debut on the tour of Argentina six years ago, which began a long and fruitful journey that has brought him here: Japan, and the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals.\n\nWhen Owen Farrell holds back to let May run out alone inside the Oita Stadium, the Leicester wing will not be thinking about anything other than beating Australia, knowing that anything but will send England home and out of another World Cup prematurely.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

It was one of those tournaments where you were going to get a go and one player maybe won\u2019t get a game.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty\n\nSadly for May, it looked as though that player was him. Then-England coach Stuart Lancaster selected Christian Wade and David Strettle on the wing for the first Test with the Pumas, before selecting Wade and Marland Yarde for the second.\n\nMay added: \u201cSo my mum and dad came out, and I wasn\u2019t picked for the first game. Then I wasn\u2019t picked for the second game and I just felt... I didn\u2019t feel ashamed but I didn\u2019t feel great because my parents were out there and it looked like I wasn\u2019t going to get a game.\n\n\u201cBut then funnily enough Christian Wade got called up for the Lions on the morning of the game, and basically because my mum and dad were out I went out for dinner with them the night before and all the other non-23 players went out on the piss, so I got the \u2018go on you can play\u2019 pretty much!\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny how it works out and I ended up starting that game, and then what was probably quite a challenging couple of weeks finished on a real good note as my parents got to watch me play and I got my first cap. It all worked out in the end.\u201d\n\nMay\u2019s wait for his first international try is well documented, with his seven-game barren run snapped in eye-catching style with his memorable score against the All Blacks. Those early days saw inconsistent selection and a serious knee injury prevent any solid run in the England team, but under Eddie Jones he has become their most lethal weapon, leaving him sixth in the all-time scoring charts behind the illustrious names of Jason Robinson, Jeremy Guscott, Ben Cohen, Will Greenwood and leading try-scorer Rory Underwood.\n\n\u201cIf you take a step back, you'd say it's an awesome achievement, something I'm very proud of and hopefully I've made my family proud,\u201d May added.\n\n\u201cEvery time I've played for England it's been an honour, to do it 50 times is a great achievement.\n\n\u201cBut it's no time to take a step back at the moment, it's a huge team game at the weekend. It's about the team, so I'll just be focusing on I can contribute to that team performance as best I can and prepare and play no different to how I do every week.\u201d\n\nJones is expected to name May in a team that could well be unchanged from the victory over Argentina last time out, with Billy Vunipola and Joe Marler both fit for selection, though Mako Vunipola is pushing to be restored to the starting XV and Jack Nowell looks certain to miss out completely.", "description": "Jonny May will run out first in the biggest match of his career this Saturday.
