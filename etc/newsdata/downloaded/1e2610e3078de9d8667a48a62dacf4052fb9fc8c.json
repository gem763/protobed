He also was not expected to contradict the previous testimony either, the person said.\n\nPhilip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of state for Europe, arrives to the Capitol for closed door interview at the Capitol in Washington DC on Saturday\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence Committee returns to a closed session where Reeker was expected to appear on Saturday\n\nDemocrats claimed victory after a federal district court judge on Friday rejected a claim by Trump and his Republican allies that the process was illegitimate because the full House had not voted to authorize it.\n\nThe judge ordered the Trump administration to give the House Judiciary Committee secret material from former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nThe White House, citing the lack of an authorizing vote, had claimed the inquiry was 'constitutionally invalid' and defied numerous congressional subpoenas for documents and testimony.\n\n'The American people had another victory yesterday in the court decision validating not only the impeachment inquiry but the imperative that the administration stop stonewalling,' House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who is leading the inquiry, told Reuters.\n\nBut Republicans remained defiant. Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said the ruling ignored historical precedents set by past impeachment inquiries and that he looked forward to 'an expeditious appeal.'\n\nAt the heart of the inquiry is a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender to face Trump in the 2020 election, and his son Hunter, who had been a director of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nThe Trump administration was withholding $391 million in security assistance for Ukraine at the time, and investigators are looking into whether Trump improperly tied the release of the aid to getting Ukraine's help in probing the Bidens.\n\nSchiff speaks next to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier this month. He is leading the House Democrats in their impeachment inquiry\n\nWilliam Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, testified on Tuesday that Trump made the aid contingent on Zelenskiy announcing he would investigate the Bidens and a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nU.S. election law prohibits candidates from accepting foreign help in an election.\n\nTrump denies wrongdoing. And, backed by his fellow Republicans in Congress, insists he is being treated unfairly.\n\nReeker, 54, a career diplomat whose portfolio includes Ukraine, is the latest on a growing list of current and former officials who have met with investigators despite the administration's argument that the inquiry is invalid.\n\nAmong issues the committees are expected to explore with Reeker is Trump's abrupt dismissal of Marie Yovanovitch in May as ambassador to Ukraine. According to emails given to congressional committees this month, Reeker sought to intervene when Trump supporters accused Yovanovitch of being disloyal to the president.\n\nReeker arrives to be deposed behind closed doors on Capitol Hill Saturday\n\nAnother diplomat involved in those communications, George Kent, testified last week that he was told to 'lie low' on Ukraine and instead defer to three of Trump's political appointees. Yovanovitch has also testified, accusing the Trump administration of recalling her based on false claims.\n\nThe committees have scheduled several depositions for next week, all behind closed doors.\n\nFor Monday, they have called Charles Kupperman, a former deputy national security adviser to Trump, and on Tuesday, lawmakers expect Alexander Vindman, the White House National Security Council's top expert on Ukraine.\n\nKathryn Wheelbarger, acting assistant secretary of defense for international security, is scheduled to appear on Wednesday, and Tim Morrison, a top White House adviser on Russia and Europe, is scheduled for Thursday.\n\nKupperman on Friday filed a lawsuit asking a federal court to determine whether he can testify. His lawyer said the judicial branch needs to weigh in on whether the president can block Kupperman and other White House officials from complying with congressional subpoenas.", "description": "Philip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, met with the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/19/20222910-0-image-a-19_1572115166195.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
