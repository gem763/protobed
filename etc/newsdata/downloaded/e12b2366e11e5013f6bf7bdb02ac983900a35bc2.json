Mitch Stringer-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe 443-foot shot to left, off left-hander Caleb Ferguson (1-2), was the 6,106th in the majors this season, setting a new record. The old mark was established in 2017.\n\nThe Dodgers clinched the National League West title with a win over the Orioles in the series opener on Tuesday, but Villar ruined any hopes Los Angeles had of a three-game sweep, breaking a 2-2 tie and putting the Orioles ahead for good.\n\nBaltimore ended a six-game losing streak and earned its 47th victory of the season, tying its 2018 total. Shawn Armstrong (1-1) got the win thanks to 1 2/3 innings of shutout relief on his 29th birthday.\n\nPadres 4, Cubs 0\n\nRookie Chris Paddack pitched six shutout innings, and Manuel Margot broke up a scoreless game with a solo homer an inning after robbing Nicholas Castellanos of a homer as San Diego beat visiting Chicago.\n\nDavid Bednar threw a perfect inning for the Padres, and Trey Wingenter pitched two perfect frames to complete a three-hit shutout. The second straight loss to San Diego dropped the Cubs into a tie with Milwaukee for the second National League wild-card position.\n\nAfter Margot\u2019s homer in the fifth, the Padres scored a run in the sixth thanks to an error on what had appeared to be a botched double steal. Wil Myers extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a two-run single in the seventh.\n\nNationals 6, Twins 2\n\nRyan Zimmerman homered and drove in three runs, Stephen Strasburg posted his National League-leading 17th win, and Trea Turner also homered as Washington cruised past Minnesota in Minneapolis.\n\nHowie Kendrick went 3-for-4 with a double, an RBI and a run, and Zimmerman also had three hits for Washington, which won for just the second time in seven games.\n\nStrasburg (17-6), who broke a tie with Atlanta\u2019s Max Fried for most wins in the NL, gave up two runs on four hits over six innings. He walked two and struck out seven.\n\nBrewers 7, Marlins 5\n\nMike Moustakas, replacing Christian Yelich in the batting order, homered twice and drove in five runs, leading Milwaukee over host Miami for its sixth straight win.\n\nYelich, who was bidding for his second straight National League MVP award, was lost for the season on Tuesday when he went out with a fractured right kneecap.\n\nMoustakas took his spot in the No. 3 hole and blasted a go-ahead, three-run homer in the third inning. Then, after the Marlins tied the score at 5, Moustakas drilled a two-run homer in the top of the ninth.\n\nIndians 4, Angels 3\n\nHome runs by Carlos Santana and Francisco Lindor lifted Cleveland to an early lead, and the bullpen held off Los Angeles in Anaheim, Calif., to complete a three-game sweep.\n\nThe blasts in the first two innings helped Cleveland grab a 4-0 lead. Indians starter Adam Plutko managed to go 4 1/3 innings before six relievers combined to limit the Angels to one hit over the final 4 2/3 innings.\n\nCarlos Carrasco (5-7) got the win after pitching 1 2/3 scoreless innings. In the ninth, Indians manager Terry Francona used three pitchers \u2014 each of whom recorded one out. Adam Cimber got his first save, finishing it off by striking out Albert Pujols on three pitches.\n\nRangers 10, Rays 9\n\nRougned Odor hit a three-run homer in the seventh inning to give Texas the lead for good in a win over Tampa Bay in Arlington, Texas.\n\nNick Solak had two hits and two runs, and Elvis Andrus also had two hits for the Rangers, who have won five of six.\n\nJi-Man Choi homered twice and drove in four runs, and Joey Wendle had two hits and two runs for the Rays, who had won six straight and 11 of 12. The Rays still own the top spot in the AL wild-card race, but the Oakland A\u2019s closed within a half-game and the Indians are a game back.\n\nA\u2019s 5, Astros 3\n\nMatt Olson keyed a four-run, sixth-inning rally with a two-run double as Oakland handed Houston a second consecutive home loss.\n\nA\u2019s catcher Sean Murphy hit his fourth homer of the season, his third in the past two games. Marcus Semien also went deep and finished 3-for-5 with two runs.\n\nBrett Anderson (12-9) surrendered just two runs on seven hits while issuing three walks over five innings. Jesus Luzardo, the Athletics\u2019 top-ranked prospect, made his major league debut, allowing one run on one hit in three innings. Liam Hendriks got the save with a perfect ninth.\n\nMets 9, Diamondbacks 0\n\nTodd Frazier and Jeff McNeil homered twice while Brandon Nimmo also connected as host New York beat Arizona.\n\nThe Mets won their third straight and improved to 8-4 in their past 12 following a six-game losing streak from Aug. 23-29. The Diamondbacks absorbed their fourth straight loss following an 11-1 run.\n\nNew York\u2019s Steven Matz (10-8) allowed four hits in six innings. He struck out seven, walked three and improved to 7-1 at home this season.\n\nBlue Jays 8, Red Sox 0\n\nTeoscar Hernandez homered as part of a six-run fifth inning, and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. had three RBIs as Toronto crushed visiting Boston, which had only four runners reach base and managed just two hits.\n\nHernandez and Randal Grichuk each drove in a pair as Toronto batted around in the fifth to send Boston to its fifth straight loss. Rowdy Tellez added a solo homer for the Blue Jays.\n\nTrent Thornton (5-9) earned the win after opener Wilmer Font pitched the first two innings for Toronto. In the first relief appearance of his career, Thornton struck out seven and walked one over five hitless innings.\n\nBraves 3, Phillies 1\n\nDallas Keuchel threw six strong innings, Tyler Flowers hit a three-run homer, and visiting Atlanta defeated Philadelphia.\n\nKeuchel (8-5) allowed three hits and one run while striking out eight and walking three. Mark Melancon earned his 11th save despite giving up a pair of singles in the ninth inning.\n\nPhillies left fielder Corey Dickerson, who homered twice Tuesday, left the Wednesday game in the sixth after grounding out. Dickerson winced coming out of the batter\u2019s box and barely made it a few feet before leaving the game. The Braves lost their left fielder as well when Johan Camargo fouled a ball off his leg and was forced to leave the game in the fourth.\n\nRoyals 8, White Sox 6\n\nJorge Soler had four hits, including his 42nd and 43rd home runs, as Kansas City defeated host Chicago. The Royals clubbed five home runs in the game.\n\nThe first 19 runs of the series came via the home run. Glenn Sparkman (4-11) picked up the win, allowing three runs on four hits in five innings. Ian Kennedy recorded his 28th save in 32 chances.\n\nReynaldo Lopez (9-13) gave up six runs on nine hits in 4 2/3 innings. He was victimized by four home runs.\n\nPirates 6, Giants 3\n\nMichael Feliz pitched out of a fifth-inning jam to preserve a one-run lead, and Elias Diaz capped a two-RBI performance with a successful squeeze bunt, lifting visiting Pittsburgh past San Francisco.\n\nJose Osuna scored three times and Felipe Vazquez recorded his second save in three days, helping the Pirates clinch the season series over the Giants with a fourth win in six meetings.\n\nThe Pirates used RBI singles by Adam Frazier, Kevin Kramer and Colin Moran, and a sacrifice fly by Diaz, to build a 4-0 lead before holding on.\n\nRockies 2, Cardinals 1\n\nIan Desmond homered, Antonio Senzatela got his first win since July 14, and Colorado beat St. Louis in Denver.\n\nTony Wolters had two hits and an RBI to help the Rockies take the first two games of the three-game series by identical scores.

Lewis, who homered in his major league debut off the Reds\u2019 Trevor Bauer in the fifth inning Tuesday, hit a three-run shot with one out in the seventh Wednesday against Sonny Gray.\n\nPhillip Ervin homered for the Reds, who have lost four of their past five games.\n\nMariners starter Marco Gonzales (15-11) went seven innings, giving up two runs on five hits.
