It was one of those last-minute Airbnb weekends that are a whirlwind of booking, packing and wondering if you left the tap and hob on: could the flat both flood and burn down? It\u2019s only as the car passes over the threshold of suburb and countryside that every cell of your body breathes a sigh of relief and you realise how much you needed a break.\n\nOn our many walks through lush woodland, we saw trees weighted with little green cobnuts, the inspiration for today\u2019s cake: an English countryside version of the Galician classic tarta de Santiago.\n\nTarta de Kent\n\nCobnuts seem to be a staple of farmers\u2019 markets rather than shops, and only southern English ones at that. If you\u2019re struggling to find them, use hazelnuts instead.\n\nPrep 15 min\n\nCook 30 min\n\nServes 10\n\nButter, for greasing\n\n150g blanched cobnuts or hazelnuts\n\n3 large eggs\n\n150g caster sugar\n\n50g dark chocolate\n\nHeat the oven to 190C (180C fan)/gas 6, then grease the bottom and sides of a 24cm round tart tin. Using a food processor or blender, blitz the nuts to a powder.\n\nIn a large bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar for a few minutes, until pale and airy.\n\nStir through the nuts to give a thick batter, smooth half the batter into the tin, crumble over the chocolate, then pour the rest of the batter on top.\n\nBake for 30 minutes, or until risen and firm to the touch.", "description": "A gluten-free sweet tart with just five ingredients and that makes great use of the season\u2019s windfall cobnuts (or hazelnuts if you live far outside Kent)", "authors": ["Tamal Ray"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ccf30bb9d2237bd4bcea9c9be0503c8503a5957/0_241_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2aa702868660f079cee266865c44a8ae", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
