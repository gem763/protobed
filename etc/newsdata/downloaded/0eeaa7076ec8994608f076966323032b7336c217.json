It was a ferocious attack causing catastrophic injuries.\n\n\u201dShe had defensive injuries to both her hands and she must have been pleading and begging for it to stop.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t. You continued to strike her and then left her there on the path.\n\n\u201cA family has been destroyed. A daughter has lost her mother.\n\n\u201cMurdered by her father who is about to commence a sentence of life imprisonment.\u201d\n\nPomphret was told it would be 20 years before he can be considered for parole.\n\nThe judge said: \u201dThis was a ferocious attack upon your wife.\n\n\u201dYou used a weapon and struck her on the head on at least 30 occasions.\n\n\u201dYou made no efforts to conceal the body but what you did was conceal the weapon and meticulously seek to conceal everything you had done in order to seek to recreate a difference scenario.\n\n\u201dI do not find you were provoked as such at the scene.\n\n\u201dYou hadn\u2019t just snapped as you alleged.\n\n\u201cThe only further mitigation available to you is your relationship with your wife, your patience and calmness over the year\u2019s in light of your wife\u2019s issues.\u201d\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nBodycam footage recorded by a police officer at the scene of the murder shows Pomphret claim he was concerned when his wife wasn't picking up her phone.\n\nHe said: \"She's lying there, oh God, she's just lying there.\"\n\nAsked if he'd touched her, he added: \"Yeah, they tried to get me to do mouth-to-mouth, oh jeez I almost threw up.\"\n\nThe IT expert claimed he had suffered a loss of control and only should be found guilty of manslaughter.\n\nHe said lost his cool after his wife had fired taunts at him, including calling him \"limp\", which referred, he reckoned, to his problems with erectile dysfunction.\n\nAnn Marie suffered a gaping hole on the right side of her head.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nPomphret showed no emotion in the dock when the verdict was returned on Friday.\n\nJudge David Aubrey, QC, said: \"You have been convicted by the jury of the crime of the murder of your wife.\n\n\"There can only be one sentence, a sentence of life imprisonment.\n\n\"I will determine the minimum term that you must serve before being considered eligible by the parole board on Tuesday morning.\"\n\nAs part of a conniving act, Pomphret refused to give his wife CPR and told the 999 car handler \u201cshe is white as a sheet, [her] chest isn\u2019t moving\u201d and declined to give chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth, adding: \"No no, she is stone cold.\"\n\nWhen encouraged further, he replied: \"Are you joking?\"\n\n(Image: CPS)\n\nThe victim, who had been diagnosed with a number of mental health issues for many years, along with her autism, had been receiving treatment for cancer.\n\nFor months, Pomphret told detectives he had no clue about his wife's death, and it was many weeks later, after 15 separate interviews with cops, that he suddenly changed tack and admitted her manslaughter.\n\nBefore the trial, the Barclays employee was described by his barrister as a \"man of impeccable character,\" who for many years, had \"been a model of self-control, patience and restraint.\"\n\nAs a result, the couple's 18-year-old daughter Megan lost her mother and father, police said.\n\nDetective Inspector Adam Waller, who was in charge of the investigation for Cheshire Police, said: \u201cThis case was truly shocking and one of the biggest investigations the Constabulary has seen in recent years.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"The injuries sustained by Ann Marie were horrific and all those involved in this investigation were determined to find her killer and ensure they were brought to justice for their actions.\n\n\u201cThe diligence and determination of every single officer and member of staff who worked on this case paid off and the evidence they tirelessly gathered was so overwhelming that when Pomphret was presented with this after he was charged he couldn\u2019t maintain the lie any longer and he was left with no choice but to plead guilty to killing his wife.\n\n\"However, this was after 15 police interviews had taken place and having spent five months on bail maintaining his innocence.\n\n\u201cWhat Pomphret did that day ripped a family apart and he will now have to face the consequences of that behind bars.\"\n\nHe added: \"I can't imagine what's going through Megan's mind at this time. She will clearly be absolutely devastated with the verdict,\" he added.\n\n\"She will come to terms with what's happened I am sure, but there will be no satisfaction with what's happened now the truth has come out.\"", "description": "David Pomphret, 51, brutally killed wife Ann Marie in Burtonwood, Warrington and will serve a minimum of 20 years behind bars", "authors": ["Amanda Crook", "Dave Burke", "Andrew Bardsley", "Image", "Liverpool Echo", "Cheshire Pplice", "Pa", "Cps"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20583599.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS195680544.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
