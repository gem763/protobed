General Assembly. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nA defiant President Trump on Monday turned the U.N. General Assembly, where foreign leaders converged to confront climate change and other global pandemics, into the backdrop for an assault on a domestic political opponent.\n\nKicking off four days of international diplomacy here, Trump repeatedly defended his conduct in pressing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated allegations of corruption by former vice president Joe Biden and his family.\n\nTrump used his meetings with heads of state to flay Biden, celebrate his personal attorney\u2019s altercations and tend to his media feuds. For instance, he argued during a sit-down with the Polish president that if Biden were a Republican, the news media would have him in \u201cthe electric chair by right now.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s head-turning visit to the United Nations came as scrutiny of his conversation with Zelensky intensifies in Washington. House Democrats demanded to see a transcript of the call as well as the intelligence officer\u2019s whistleblower complaint that brought it to light, and argued that Trump\u2019s alleged conduct represents an abuse of power and could be grounds for impeachment.\n\nThe Ukraine episode hung over Trump\u2019s first day at the annual U.N. meeting, beginning with a volley of shouted questions from journalists as he walked into the towering U.N. headquarters building in New York. He again admitted that he raised the Biden allegations in his call with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to talk about corruption,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe president addresses journalists after a meeting at the United Nations. (Peter Foley/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nYet Trump struck an unapologetic note, barreling past accusations that he yet again improperly engaged with a foreign country. Echoing language he used to dismiss the Russia investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III, the former special counsel, Trump called the Ukraine development another \u201cDemocratic witch hunt,\u201d and said any problematic dealings with Ukraine were done by Biden.\n\n\u201cThe one who\u2019s got the problem is Biden,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump denied that he explicitly withheld $250 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine unless its government launched a probe into the Biden family. He insisted his and Zelensky\u2019s July 25 conversation had been \u201ca perfect phone call,\u201d and he hinted at releasing a transcript or notes.\n\n\u201cI hope you see it, frankly, and you will find out that I did not do that at all and you\u2019ll be very disappointed when you see it,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nDespite the peril the Ukrainian episode presents for his presidency, Trump seemed to revel in the opportunity to kick up dust around Biden, who has led Trump in virtually every public poll for several months.\n\nTrump is attempting to sully one of Biden\u2019s calling cards in the 2020 campaign: His pledge to honor the rule of law and to restore moral integrity and ethics to the Oval Office. Trump is trying to portray Biden as corrupt and deny him this signature issue.\n\n\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden speaks during a town hall meeting last week in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. (Charlie Neibergall/Associated Press)\n\nWithin Trump\u2019s orbit, some argue that the Ukraine news cycle will ultimately benefit the president \u2014 if he and his allies can redirect the public\u2019s attention to what they claim is unethical behavior by Biden and his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cWe know that Hunter Biden had a sweetheart gig in Ukraine and that Joe Biden has bragged about trying to fire Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor looking into corruption,\u201d Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, said in a written statement.\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\n[Fact-checking Trump\u2019s latest claims on Biden and Ukraine]\n\n\n\nFrom left: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney sit in on a meeting at the United Nations. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nIn private talking points that the Republican National Committee sent out to surrogates Monday morning, the committee reiterates Trump\u2019s claim that his conversations with Zelensky were \u201ctotally appropriate\u201d \u2014 and then offers a half-dozen unflattering claims about Biden and Ukraine.\n\nIn the run-up to the U.N. General Assembly, Trump\u2019s open door to an unprecedented meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had been the most anticipated potential development.\n\nThat possibility now seems remote, and has taken a back seat to the Ukraine matter. Anticipation has also been building for Trump\u2019s scheduled meeting Wednesday with Zelensky, who is making his largest international debut here since winning election in May.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have, obviously, the clarity that we need regarding this meeting, but this is, I think, going to be the most-watched bilateral meeting at the General Assembly,\u201d said Heather A. Conley, head of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n[Trump\u2019s Ukraine call reveals a president convinced of his own invincibility]\n\nAt the United Nations, visiting diplomats were baffled by the sudden interjection of a complex Trump scandal that they found mystifying.\n\n\u201cIt puts foreign leaders in a difficult if not impossible position,\u201d said Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cHow do you manage this complicated person who doesn\u2019t play the game by the rules, and how do you somehow protect this important relationship? Everybody\u2019s a bit wary.\u201d\n\nVictoria Holt, managing director at the Henry L. Stimson Center, said the arcane details of the Ukraine story and its overlap with U.S. politics are largely beside the point for other leaders here. \u201cI\u2019m sure they are scratching their heads,\u201d she said. \u201cThe United States is supposed to be leading on major issues\u201d such as climate change.\n\nTrump stayed away from the Ukraine topic in his only major prepared remarks of the day, before a U.S.-led summit on \u201creligious freedom\u201d that also contained no reference to Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim immigration to the United States.\n\n\n\nTrump and Vice President Pence appear together at the United Nations. (Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBut the president tweeted about Ukraine and Biden on his way into that event, calling those who question his conduct \u201cstone cold Crooked\u201d and questioning the patriotism of the \u201cso-called whistleblower.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump kept up the theme when he met with Polish President Andrzej Duda. With Duda watching, Trump branded as \u201ca faker\u201d a journalist who asked him to elaborate on what he had discussed with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden and his son are corrupt, all right?\u201d Trump added. \u201cBut the fake news doesn\u2019t want to report it because they\u2019re Democrats. If that ever happened \u2014 if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they\u2019d be getting the electric chair by right now. Look at the double standards. You people ought to be ashamed of yourself. . . . You\u2019re crooked as hell.\u201d\n\nLater, during a meeting with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore, Trump praised last week\u2019s combative television appearance by his personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, which some critics mocked as belligerent.\n\n\u201cI watched Rudy take apart Fredo,\u201d Trump said, referring to CNN anchor Chris Cuomo using a nickname from \u201cThe Godfather\u201d movies. \u201cFredo\u2019s performance was incompetent. . . . Rudy Giuliani took Fredo to the cleaners. First time I\u2019ve watched CNN in a long time.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister sat impassively at Trump\u2019s side, perhaps bewildered by the American film reference.\n\nRucker and Parker reported from Washington.
