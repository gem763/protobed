Cooper-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAndrew Benintendi and Christian Vazquez each had two hits and two runs, and Xander Bogaerts and Rafael Devers accounted for all five Boston RBIs as the Red Sox (80-72), after surviving a wild finish, completed the interleague portion of their schedule with a 10-10 record.\n\nRodriguez (18-6) became Boston\u2019s first 18-game winner since Rick Porcello won 22 in 2016, throwing six innings of two-hit ball. He held the Giants (74-79) to one unearned run while walking two and striking out 10.\n\nThe Red Sox did all their scoring against Bumgarner (9-9) in the first two innings.\n\nDevers and Bogaerts had RBI singles in the first inning after Benintendi had opened the game with a double and Vazquez followed with a walk.\n\nBoston added three in the second in a very similar manner, with four consecutive singles by Benintendi, Vazquez, Devers and Bogaerts. Devers\u2019 hit drove in one and Bogaerts\u2019 hit knocked in a pair to make it 5-1.\n\nAfter getting an unearned run in the first, the Giants didn\u2019t score again until the eighth, and they nearly erased all of their four-run deficit in the process.\n\nKevin Pillar\u2019s two-out, two-run double against Marcus Walden got the Giants within 5-3 in the eighth.\n\nThe Giants then loaded the bases against Matt Barnes, who won a six-pitch duel with pinch hitter Stephen Vogt, getting a strikeout.\n\nCloser Brandon Workman then came within one ball of blowing a two-run lead in the ninth. He walked Pillar with two outs and the bases loaded to force in a run that trimmed the Boston lead to 5-4.\n\nWorkman then went to a full count on Evan Longoria before getting him swinging to wrap up his 15th save.\n\nThe Giants had won the first two games of the series 7-6 (in 15 innings) and 11-3.\n\nPillar finished with three RBIs, and Mauricio Dubon scored twice for the Giants, who were out-hit 10-6.\n\nOne day after recording his 2,000th career win, Giants manager Bruce Bochy take his 2,023rd loss.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez earned his career-best 18th win, and his teammates rocked San Francisco Giants ace Madison Bumgarner on Thursday afternoon, allowing the host Boston Red Sox to salvage one win in the three-game interleague series with a 5-4 victory.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431749055&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I1ZT-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
