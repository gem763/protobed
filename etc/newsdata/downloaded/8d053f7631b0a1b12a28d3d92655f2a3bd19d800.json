Its total returns fell to 7 per cent, down from 12.5 per cent a year earlier.\n\nMr Browning, speaking on the sidelines of the 50th birthday celebration of the Property Council of Australia's Victorian chapter, said that all retail was under pressure and his fund had held up relative to others in the industry.\n\n\"For us, if it\u2019s a fund that\u2019s simply exposed to retail, the returns are lower, but relative to our benchmark, which is the peers, we\u2019ve done okay,\" he said.\n\n\"In the Core Fund, yes, because let\u2019s say office has done well and industrial\u2019s done well, then they\u2019re insulated a bit from that lower performance of retail.\"\n\nAny corrections to the retail downturn was unlikely any time soon, he said.\n\n\"So that\u2019s the unknown - will it correct? What it usually does is not do it very quickly.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe downturn would likely discourage asset owners from revaluing their portfolios, he said. While ISPT revalued its portfolio quarterly - \"we're probably the extreme\" - some owners only did it every second year, Mr Browning said.\n\nOthers do it sporadically and some, not at all.\n\n\"If you don\u2019t value you\u2019re not changing anything,\" Mr Browning said. \"Harvey Norman was the classic; which is a property portfolio. He [Gerry Harvey] said \u2018I\u2019m just not going to value it'. \"\n\nRetailer Harvey Norman, which owns its own stores, refused to revalue any of its properties over a six-month period - a devaluation could have cut the company's profit - in the wake of the GFC that saw Australia's listed real estate companies write down a collective $14 billion in values.\n\n\"I'm not going to revalue or devalue anything,\" Harvey Norman executive chairman Gerry Harvey said in March 2009.\n\n\"I have taken the view that nobody knows what properties are worth at the moment.\"", "description": "ISPT boss Daryl Browning warns of more retail pain to come.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3916%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_80%2C$y_11/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f03268eac354d6d1ca6e9f8cd9fbfa626667f5cb", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
