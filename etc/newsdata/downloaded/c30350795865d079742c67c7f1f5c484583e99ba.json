He and Kelly Clarkson will sing a new and purified duet, and it goes like this:\n\nClarkson: What will my friends think\u2026? Legend: I think they should rejoice\u2026 Clarkson: If I have one more drink\u2026? Legend: It\u2019s your body, and your choice.\n\nYes, it\u2019s finally happened, y\u2019all\u2026 The left\u2019s woke jihad has finally cast aside all artistry, subtlety, and poetry in favor of a ball peen hammer to drive a railroad spike into your forehead.\n\nWhat had once been a lovely, lyrical, playful, and yes \u2014 even insightful song about the beautiful dance of human seduction, and how it is so gloriously teased out by both the man and the woman (who is in total control, by the way), is now a goddamned NARAL bumper sticker.\n\nWe don\u2019t know about the rest of the song yet, but it probably goes like this\u2026\n\nClarkson: I really can\u2019t stay\u2026 Legend: It used to be cold outside\u2026 Clarkson: I think I wanna be gay\u2026 Legend: Climate Change makes me cry\u2026 Clarkson: You\u2019re much too cisgen\u2026 Legend: Oh, how I love CNN\u2026 Clarkson: I might marry an appliance\u2026 Legend: Trump is racist and anti-science\u2026 Clarkson: That appliance vibrates real nice\u2026 Legend: You know, I\u2019ve learned to menstruate\u2026 Clarkson: After the wedding we\u2019ll throw rice\u2026 Legend: How dare you culturally appropriate\u2026\n\nHave you noticed, though, how these Year Zero Puritans always attack the classics?\n\nWhat I mean is, if John Legend and the rest of the fascist left want to purify art, why Baby It\u2019s Cold Outside and Huckleberry Finn and To Kill a Mockingbird?\n\nNow, before I go any further\u2026 Don\u2019t misunderstand. As a free speech extremist I oppose any and all efforts to \u201ccorrect\u201d art, even art I personally do not find all that artistic, but why don\u2019t John Legend and his fellow left-wing vandals rewrite 2 Live Crew\u2019s As Nasty as They Wanna Be into As Distasteful as the Consent Form Allows? ? Or N.W.A.\u2019s Niggaz4Life into Afro-Americans for Choice?\n\nThey don\u2019t because their crusade is not about decency or purity or sensitivity or inclusion\u2026 It is only about tearing down and destroying America\u2019s shared culture, our classics, the art and artistry that unifies us, that brings us joy, that allows us some escape.\n\nFACT: While John Legend was defacing Baby Its Cold Outside, dozens of porn shorts were filmed featuring young women agreeing to be abused and demeaned for $500, and those shorts will be seen by millions and millions of young men. But Legend would never do anything about that, because this is not about respecting or saving women, it\u2019s about ravaging what\u2019s beautiful, unifying, timeless, and perfect.\n\nJohn Legend is little different from the Taliban blowing up statues in the name of virtue.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
