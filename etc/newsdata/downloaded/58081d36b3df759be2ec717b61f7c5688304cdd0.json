REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump Organization on Friday said it was exploring a sale of the rights to its Washington hotel, a property at the center of litigation over allegations that President Donald Trump violated anti-corruption provisions of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe possible license sale, being marketed by real estate company JLL, stems in part from criticisms from ethics watchdogs and lawmakers regarding the family\u2019s profits from the hotel, which is in a historic building on Pennsylvania Avenue in the heart of the capital.\n\n\u201cPeople are objecting to us making so much money on the hotel, and therefore we may be willing to sell,\u201d Eric Trump, Trump\u2019s son and an executive vice president at the company, said in a statement.\n\nThree lawsuits, one brought by lawmakers, one by a watchdog group and the other by state attorneys general, said Trump\u2019s ownership violated the anti-corruption \u201cemoluments\u201d provisions of the U.S. Constitution that ban the president from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments without congressional consent. Trump is contesting the lawsuits.\n\nTrump\u2019s failure to disentangle himself from his family business exposes him to inducements by officials and others seeking to curry favor, the lawsuits said.\n\nThe site, a few blocks away from the White House, has attracted protesters and disputes over its restaurants. The hotel has become a known gathering spot for Trump associates, Republicans and others in the president\u2019s orbit since he took office in January 2017.\n\nThe Trumps are seeking more than $500 million for the rights, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said that if a sale were completed, Trump\u2019s legal team could seek dismissal of the emoluments litigation on mootness grounds. But Tobias said a judge might reject such arguments.\n\nThe Washington hotel has been a moneymaker for Trump. In a financial disclosure form from May, he reported $40.8 million in revenue from the property in 2018.", "description": "The Trump Organization on Friday said it was exploring a sale of the rights to its Washington hotel, a property at the center of litigation over allegations that President Donald Trump violated anti-corruption provisions of the U.S. Constitution.", "authors": ["Jan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444943670&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1KG", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
