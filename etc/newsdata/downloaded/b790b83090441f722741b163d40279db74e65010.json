More than two weeks later, their lawyers from the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES) have no idea where the majority of these women are being held, and they can\u2019t find any updated information in ICE\u2019s online detainee tracking system.\n\nThe inability to track these immigrants could have fatal consequences if their health continues to deteriorate, according to Andrea Meza, the director of family detention services at RAICES.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really fearful that their conditions could worsen,\u201d Meza said. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to be in another ICE press release about death in detention.\u201d\n\nThe situation highlights a common problem for migrants in ICE custody: They can be transferred between facilities with little notice and yet their new locations are not promptly updated in the system. If their existing lawyers and family members can\u2019t find them, they may have to go through their cases without legal representation, especially in remote areas where legal counsel is sparse. And those with serious health issues could die if advocates who don\u2019t know where their clients were transferred are unable to fight for their right to medical treatment.\n\nICE did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nHuffPost reported that while at Karnes, some of the immigrants were allegedly being denied lifesaving care, such as cancer and HIV treatment, and that suicidal patients were not receiving psychiatric counseling. One woman with cancer in her uterus said she had not received medical treatment for more than two months. Another immigrant, who is HIV positive, said she was not getting her medication or being evaluated by a doctor, even as her symptoms worsened. A doctor told HuffPost that anyone with a serious physical illness requires constant medical visits to stop their disease from rapidly progressing.\n\nThe lack of medical care in immigrant detention facilities is well-established. Seven immigrants have died in ICE detention centers this year, and six minors have died in Border Patrol centers, in many cases because they didn\u2019t receive proper medical help for their illnesses.\n\nThe online system that tracks ICE detainees is notoriously faulty. While in most cases ICE is not legally required to inform lawyers when their clients are being transferred, that information is supposed to be accessible via the agency\u2019s online ICE Detainee Locator within roughly 24 hours of a person\u2019s relocation according to Andrew Lorenzen-Strait, who formerly worked as a deputy assistant director for custody programs at ICE.\n\nBut according to lawyers who rely on the system to track their clients, the locator is unreliable.\n\nKate Lincoln-Goldfinch, a Texas-based immigration attorney, said the tool only helps her find detainees 50% of the time, in part because names and birthdates are often entered incorrectly, making detainees impossible to search. It can take up to a few weeks for someone who is transferred to a new facility to show up in the system, which means families are often left wondering whether their loved ones have been deported back to life-threatening situations in their home countries, Lincoln-Goldfinch said.\n\n\u201cI think FedEx does a better job of tracking its packages than ICE does of tracking the people it detains,\u201d Lincoln-Goldfinch said.\n\nOther lawyers have complained that the locator doesn\u2019t load properly, or that it will show \u201cno results found\u201d for someone who is still in ICE custody. Meza said the latter is happening for roughly 100 of the women who were recently transferred from Karnes, and that another 660 of them show up in the system as still being detained at the facility even though they have been moved.\n\nAside from the medical concerns, Meza worries that these women won\u2019t have legal representation if RAICES can\u2019t help them find lawyers near the new detention centers, which may be in remote areas, and share the information they\u2019ve already collected about their cases. Without legal assistance, immigrants are five and a half times less likely to be deported, according to a 2015 study from the University of Pennsylvania Law Review.\n\nThere are a record number of immigrants currently being held in detention, which is undoubtedly putting strain on a tracking system that didn\u2019t work well to begin with. But in addition to logistical issues that might exist, immigration advocates say the administration has a record of dehumanizing asylum-seekers and is likely not prioritizing a locator that would help lawyers keep their clients in the U.S.\n\nBefore splitting up families last summer under its zero tolerance policy, the government had no system in place to track the whereabouts of the separated parents and children.\n\n\u201cWe know the whole for-profit prison system is putting money before people\u2019s humanity,\u201d said Meza. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time before we see the next death in ICE custody.\u201d", "description": "Some of the women have serious medical issues, and lawyers worry they could die in detention.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9ce05b2100003d07ac6b00.jpeg?cache=julys0mwph&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
