The athleisure brand beat expectations in its second quarter on every possible metric: revenue ($883.4 million vs $846.8 million expected), earnings (96 cents per share vs. 89 cents expected), and same-store sales (up 15% vs 12.2% expected). North America sales were up 21% and its menswear is growing like crazy, up 35%, outpacing women\u2019s apparel.\n\nBut a more macroeconomic takeaway came on its earnings call: amid industrywide concerns in the apparel business over Trump tariffs, Lululemon (LULU) is nimbly avoiding trade war pitfalls.\n\nJust 6% of Lululemon\u2019s finished goods are currently susceptible to U.S. tariffs on imports from China. \u201cThat percentage is down considerably, given how we have diversified our vendor base,\u201d said CFO P.J. Guido on the call. And here\u2019s the key line: \u201cWe've never had more flexibility than we do today in our supply chain. So going forward, we do not expect it to be a big impact to the business.\u201d\n\nAccording to research firm Panjiva, Lululemon has recently moved more production out of China, to places like Vietnam and Cambodia.\n\nGuido also noted that Lululemon increased its use of air freight \u201cas a hedge against potential port congestion related to China tariffs,\u201d and that its gross profit margin rose 20% in the second quarter anyway.\n\nU.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, Guido reiterated, is \u201can issue that we feel is highly manageable for us.\u201d\n\nA woman passes by a Lululemon Athletica real store in New York City, U.S., March 30, 2017.

The brand\u2019s Asia-Pacific revenues grew 33% in Q2, driven by 68% growth in China.\n\nLululemon shares are up 60% so far this year.\n\nLululemon shares in 2019 More\n\n\u2014\n\nDaniel Roberts is the sports business writer at Yahoo Finance.
