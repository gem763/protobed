In his first five appearances, he did not reach even a semifinal; within that span, he had won at least one title at the three other Grand Slam events.\n\nThings have changed dramatically in recent years, however: The courts have slowed, his knees have largely held up, and the U.S. Open has become Nadal\u2019s land of opportunity.\n\n\u201cI think at the beginning of my career have been some tough moments here, losing matches,\u201d Nadal said Friday. \u201cBut since a long time ago, every time that I came here I felt comfortable, no? I felt very competitive and fighting for the big things.\u201d\n\nVery big things await Nadal with one more win at the Open this year. With a victory in Sunday\u2019s final against Daniil Medvedev, Nadal would finish with four U.S. Open titles this decade, passing Novak Djokovic\u2019s three. Roger Federer, who dominated last decade with five consecutive U.S. Open titles between 2004 and 2008, has been surprisingly stymied this decade, winning zero titles and reaching just one final, in 2015.", "description": "On Sunday against Daniil Medvedev, Nadal, known as the king of clay, is seeking his fourth U.S. Open title since 2010.", "authors": ["Ben Rothenberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/sports/07openmenweb1/07openmenweb1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
