President Trump and this newspaper have opened the eyes of countless Americans to how biased the rest of the news media really is and the uphill fight we wage every day against fake news. I especially enjoy reading the opinion section and the book reviews, because they do a great job of countering the other op-eds we are faced with on a daily basis. I also enjoy reading the letters to the editor and have found that I agree with the writers almost 100 percent of the time. As comforting as that may be, however, that is the problem.\n\nPeople reading The Times are like-minded folks who, most of the time, have the same political beliefs. Whenever we readers read a letter to the editor, I\u2019m betting we all just shake our heads and say to ourselves the writer is spot-on. But it\u2019s preaching to the choir. I know it is almost impossible to have a conservative view published elsewhere, and I\u2019m sure many have tried, but I would suggest more of us write to fake news newspapers and other outlets to try and get their readers to at least think about our viewpoints. This is especially critical over the next 14 months. We must persist for the good of the country. Thank God for President Trump.\n\nWALTER S KOWAL JR.\n\nGainesville, Va.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
