They stood to receive a bonus $125,000 if they had won the World Cup, or even an extra $25,000 for victory in a semi-final on top of the $10,000 match fee, as part of a $5.5 million prize pool from Rugby Australia.\n\nThe success of reaching the World Cup final in England in 2015 is a distant memory for the 2019 Wallabies who were well below the standard of a world class team.\n\nThe Australian side was ranked sixth coming into the World Cup and played like it.\n\nThe host nation, which has been deprived of playing consistently against tier-one countries, showed the Wallabies how to play the game \u2013 fast, skilfully and with determination.\n\nDivisive Wallabies coach Michael Cheika, whose post-game rants about match referees were starting to wear thin, is likely to step down or be sacked. His 50 per cent success rate after five years is not good enough.\n\nNothing less than victory\n\nRugby Australia chief executive Raelene Castle said before the World Cup that nothing less than victory would be deemed to be a successful campaign for the Wallabies.\n\nThere is no obvious successor to Cheika. New Zealand-born coach Dave Rennie, who is coaching in Glasgow, is the only name being consistently thrown around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer Wallabies coach Bob Dwyer, who helped the national team win the 1991 tournament, said coaching was a brutal gig, but the Cheika era should not be seen as a failure after the 2015 finals appearance.\n\n\"It's a tricky business coaching. The only thing you can be sure of is you're going to lose your job. I think we can say he's been a successful Wallabies coach,\" he told The Australian Financial Review.\n\nThe early exit of the Wallabies will also add to further anxiety about the precarious state of rugby in Australia as more players chase the high salaries in Europe or Japan.\n\nRugby Australia recorded a net surplus of $2.8 million in 2018, but its financial future hinges on securing another strong broadcasting deal after the current contract runs out in 2020.\n\nCritics said there is a major disconnect between the international, Super Rugby and club level.b\n\nSad exit: David Pocock, far right, reacts to defeat with Wallabies teammates. Getty\n\nFormer Wallabies forward and now Queensland Investment Corporation chief executive Damien Frawley said rugby will never be able to compete with rugby league and AFL while it does not have a permanent home on free-to-air television, rather than just subscription service Foxtel.\n\nBut Dwyer remained up-beat, saying participation in rugby, especially women, is going well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Club rugby, which for me is the real barometer, is going from strength to strength,\" he said.\n\n\"Rugby supporters are a different bunch from other football sports. They are quite staunch members of their own fraternity. They don't make much noise or fuss, but they are loyal.\"\n\nThat loyalty will be tested over the next four years.", "description": "Rugby Australia will have a tougher task to win over fans after the Wallabies early exit from the World Cup in Japan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3865%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_297%2C$y_26/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3195c4f078c001f43ec3b5196e44de55f64eaf0d", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
