The median sale price of a Hamptons home has fallen 7.9% to $860,000, according to a 2019 Q1 report from Douglas Elliman Real Estate, which puts Hamptons home sales at their lowest levels in seven years. And there are the most luxury homes on the market since at least 2011, Oshrat Carmiel reported for Bloomberg on October 24.\n\nThis high-end real-estate slump can be traced, in part, to Donald Trump's 2016 federal tax reform, as the Financial Times' Ben Foldy reported. The new tax laws make it more expensive for homeowners to own luxury homes because they can deduct only $10,000 in state and local taxes from their federal income taxes.\n\n\"The high-end of the Hamptons housing market continued to move slower [in the first quarter of 2019] in the aftermath of the new federal tax law,\" the Douglas Elliman report reads.\n\nA beach house in the Hamptons.
