Before that, the European Central Bank (ECB) will meet on September 12 and is expected to approve a range of stimulus measures to prop up the sagging European economy.\n\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro outside of the West Wing of the White House.

Powell added that the \"most likely outlook for our economy remains a favorable one.\"\n\nNavarro's rhetoric echoed President Trump, who tweeted on Friday: \"Where did I find this guy Jerome?\" The President nominated Powell to his post in 2017.\n\nBen is the D.C. producer for Yahoo Finance.
