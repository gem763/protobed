Domingo has been accused by 20 women of sexual harassment and intimidation.\n\n\u201cI made my debut at the Metropolitan Opera at the age of 27 and have sung at this magnificent theater for 51 consecutive, glorious years,\u201d Domingo said in a statement. \u201cWhile I strongly dispute recent allegations made about me, and I am concerned about a climate in which people are condemned without due process, upon reflection I believe that my appearance in this production of Macbeth would distract from the hard work of my colleagues both onstage and behind the scenes. As a result, I have asked to withdraw and I thank the leadership of the Met for graciously granting my request.\u201d\n\nHe also said that in addition to pulling out of Macbeth, his dress rehearsal for the show would be his \u201clast performance on the Met stage.\u201d The Met in turn released a statement that seemed to indicate he was asked to leave: \u201cThe Metropolitan Opera confirms that Pl\u00e1cido Domingo has agreed to withdraw from all future performances at the Met, effective immediately,\u201d it said. \u201cThe Met and Mr. Domingo are in agreement that he needed to step down.\u201d\n\nThe news is a reversal from the Met\u2019s apparent position earlier today: On Tuesday morning, NPR reported on a bizarre meeting held by the opera\u2019s general manager over the weekend, where he told concerned employees that Domingo had not been suspended because the accounts of his 20 accusers \u2014 the subject of an extensive investigation by the Associated Press, which interviewed nearly three dozen people \u2014 have not been corroborated.\n\nDomingo has been accused of a range of misconduct over the span of three decades, including forced kissing and professionally retaliating against women who had refused his sexual advances. In the wake of the AP report, the LA Opera \u2014 where Domingo has served as a director for over ten years \u2014 announced it was launching an investigation into his behavior, as did the American Guild of Music Arts, the union that represents the performers and technical staff at the Met. Yet the Met itself took no such immediate action.\n\nOn Saturday, NPR published statements from four anonymous Met employees who objected to Domingo\u2019s continued presence there but felt afraid to speak up. The same day, general manager Peter Gelb gathered members of the opera\u2019s chorus to reportedly discuss why the embattled star will still perform.\n\nDuring the meeting, Gelb allegedly offered several explanations and seemed to cast doubt on both the AP\u2019s reporting and the experiences of Domingo\u2019s 20 accusers.\n\nAccording to NPR, Gelb claimed the women had come forward \u201conly to the AP and not to other credible news outlets as well.\u201d (Employees say Gelb \u201cspecifically cited\u201d the New York Times, where his father once served as managing editor, as one such \u201ccredible\u201d outlet.) He also said the AP\u2019s story lacked \u201ccorroboration,\u201d though the AP said it had corroborated the women\u2019s stories and spoken to nearly three dozen people who said they had witnessed \u201cinappropriate sexually tinged behavior\u201d by Domingo. Gelb allegedly cited the accusers\u2019 anonymity as a reason to doubt their accounts. An employee apparently challenged him, saying two accusers, Patricia Wulf and Angela Turner Wilson, have since come forward by name.\n\nIn a statement to NPR, the Met said that Gelb had \u201creiterated how seriously the Met takes accusations of sexual harassment and abuse of power\u201d and that the \u201cfair thing to do\u201d was to wait for the LA Opera and AGMA investigations to be complete. A few hours later, it announced Domingo\u2019s departure.\n\nEmployees at the meeting were reportedly upset that Domingo was continuing to work at the Met, especially when the decision is compared with the Met\u2019s handling of its former music director James Levine. In 2017, three men accused Levine of sexual abuse (their number eventually grew to nine); he was soon suspended and was fired after an investigation. One female chorister told NPR, \u201cPl\u00e1cido Domingo is a huge cash cow, and sometimes I feel like management cares more about money and reputation \u2026 I feel that Peter Gelb is saying, \u2018I don\u2019t have a problem exposing my artists to such situations.\u2019\u201d", "description": "In a meeting held over the weekend, Metropolitan Opera general manager Peter Gelb said the accusations of sexual harassment and intimidation by Pl\u00e1cido Domingo from 20 women lack \u201ccorroboration\u2019; a few hours later Domingo announced his departure.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/24/24-placido-domingo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
