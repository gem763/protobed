I was shocked at how many people it required,\u201d she told Variety at the film\u2019s premiere on Wednesday night at Fox Studios in Los Angeles. \u201cThe real ones weigh like 300 pounds \u2014 of course, not the movie one \u2014 but it was interesting to inform the physicality. They have to be quite strong because even though it\u2019s weightless in space, the force pressing against you is so extreme. It was really wild and exciting and kind of like a childhood dream come true.\u201d\n\nPortman\u2019s co-star Jeremiah Birkett agreed, adding that the slo-mo space walk came easy because it was impossible to move quickly while wearing the heavy costume.\n\n\u201cI needed two people to put it on me,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s really heavy and claustrophobic. You have the weighted shoes, weighted suit, you feel like, \u2018Oh crap, I\u2019m the guy. I feel this.'\u201d\n\n\u201cLucy in the Sky\u201d is one of many space movies hitting theaters this year. This one is more of an intimate character story than a sprawling spectacle, more in line with Brad Pitt\u2019s \u201cAd Astra\u201d than \u201cStar Wars: Rise of Skywalker.\u201d \u201cLucy in the Sky\u201d follows the mental unraveling of Portman\u2019s character after she returns to Earth from an extended interstellar mission and is also loosely based on real-life astronaut Lisa Nowak\u2019s public love triangle and arrest from 2007. Since the film spends more time on Earth than it does among the stars, does it qualify as a \u201cspace movie?\u201d The cast presented both sides of the argument.\n\n\u201cMost space movies focus on the going out into space. This one focuses on the coming back,\u201d Jon Hamm told Variety. \u201cI think it\u2019s an interesting choice and a very unique perspective. What happens to people when they\u2019re confronted with this incredibly vast and unique experience? How do you manage to get up and go to the grocery store and do dry cleaning when you\u2019ve been in space and have seen the Earth from a couple hundred miles up?\u201d\n\nDirector Noah Hawley contends that his film falls into more than just the sci-fi genre.\n\n\u201cI call it a magic-realism astronaut movie,\u201d he told Variety. \u201cIt means that it\u2019s not a literal story on some level. We\u2019re using aspects of magic realism to put you into her point of view. She\u2019s a character that starts in one place and experiences an existential crisis and psychological decline, and I want you to go with her and experience that with her. You\u2019re feeling it viscerally. You\u2019re not sitting and judging her, you\u2019re pulled in with her.\u201d\n\nWith all the space movies that have come before \u201cLucy in the Sky\u201d and all the ones sure to come after it, Hawley offered an explanation why people love watching them: \u201cJon says in the movie, \u2018No matter how complex the universe is, it\u2019s still simpler than life on Earth.\u2019 I think when life on Earth gets really complicated and stressful, we look to the stars.\u201d\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
