USA TODAY\n\nNot all heroes wear capes.\n\nTom Holland channeled his inner Peter Parker and stepped up to save the day, Disney CEO Bob Iger revealed Friday on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" It was Holland, 23, the current face of Spider-Man, who stepped up and asked Iger to give fans what they wanted: to keep the superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nSpidey drama began over the summer, when negotiations broke down between Disney and Sony Pictures over future Spider-Man films, sending fans into panic.\n\nSony has controlled the rights to the web-slinger since 1999, but the two studios have been happily (or so we thought) sharing Spider-Man across a plethora of films since 2015, including major roles in the latest \"Avengers\" movies. As part of the previous agreement, Marvel had also been acting as a producer on the 2017 and 2019 standalone Sony \"Spider-Man\" movies starring Holland, which were both box-office blockbusters.\n\nTom Holland knew where he wanted Spider-Man to be: at home in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

But it was clear that he cared so much. And we care a lot about him. And he's a great Spider-Man, isn't he? I felt for him and it was clear that the fans wanted all this to happen.\"\n\nHe then spoke with more Disney team members before calling the head of Sony to try and quell the Spider-Man standoff.\n\n\"I said, 'We've got to figure out a way to get this done. For Tom and for the fans,' \" Iger recalled.\n\n\"Like two divorced parents coming together and figuring it out,\" Kimmel quipped.\n\nMarvel announced last month that the superhero would stay put for another film. The third installment in \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" is scheduled for release in 2021.\n\n\"Sometimes, companies when they're negotiating, or people when they're negotiating with one another, they kind of forget that there are other folks out there that actually matter,\" Iger added. \"There's a whole Parker family out there (to think about).\"\n\nContributing: Bryan Alexander and Andrea Mandell, USA TODAY\n\nTom Holland: Spider-Man is in 'safe hands' with Sony, calls his Marvel years 'incredible'\n\nSpider-Man to stayin Marvel Cinematic Universe: Tom Holland and Zendaya react\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/06/tom-holland-helped-keep-spider-man-in-marvel-movies/3890557002/", "description": "Tom Holland channeled his inner Spider-Man to save the day and keep the superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Disney CEO Bob Iger says.", "authors": ["Hannah Yasharoff", "Published P.M.
