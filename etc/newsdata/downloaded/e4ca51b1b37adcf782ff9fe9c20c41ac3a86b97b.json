We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx \u2014 NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019\n\nOn Wednesday Trump justified his warning by pointing to a National Hurricane Center map of Dorian\u2019s possible route that had clearly been altered with some kind of marker to clumsily include Alabama.\n\n\u201cEverybody makes mistakes,\u201d Smith said. \u201cInstead ... the president blamed the media for his own inaccurate warning and then started to rewrite history on the matter\u201d \u2014 and used \u201cdoctored graphics.\u201d\n\nSmith asked: \u201cWhy would the president of the United States do this? He decries fake news that isn\u2019t, and disseminates fake news that is.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Trump tweeted another map, which appeared to show a thin sliver of Alabama potentially in the path of winds. (\u201cHe has no clue what he\u2019s talking about, or what is plotted on that map,\u201d University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy told The Associated Press about Trump\u2019s latest offering. \u201cAt the time of that cycle, Alabama was at even lower risk than before, and it was barely anything to start with.\u201d)\n\nInstead of tweeting, it would have been a good time for Trump to \u201capologize and move on,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThat map was from the day the hurricane became a hurricane .... It was four days old at the precise time he said Alabama would likely be hit harder than anticipated. By then, it was fake news defined on a very serious subject.\u201d\n\nSmith also listed Trump\u2019s other multiple lies. \u201cThink: China pays the tariffs. The wall is going up. Historic inauguration crowds. The Russia probe was a witch hunt. You need an ID to buy cereal. Noise from windmills causes cancer. It\u2019s endless!\u201d he said.\n\nCheck out Smith\u2019s take on Trump\u2019s Dorian flub in the video up top.", "description": "The anchor wonders why the president can't simply apologize for his screw-up and move on.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d719617240000ee1776978d.png?cache=fwavazhxnm&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
