Also there was big news from Juul, which will stop selling its most popular fruit flavors, and health officials say the vaping sickness has now affected nearly 1,500 people.\n\nWe'll start with drug pricing...\n\nHouse Democrats advance drug pricing bill\n\nTwo House committees on Thursday debated a sweeping bill to allow Medicare to negotiate the prices of prescription drugs.\n\nThe Education and Labor committee voted along party lines to advance the bill, and the Energy and Commerce Committee spent the entire day working through hundreds of Republican amendments.\n\nRepublicans have accused Democrats of rushing a partisan bill through committee, and the Energy and Commerce amendments reflected their frustration.\n\nThe Education and Labor Committee, which has limited jurisdiction, passed the bill after accepting a few minor amendments from Democrats.\n\nThe amendment offered by Rep. Pramila Jayapal Pramila JayapalOvernight Health Care \u2014 Presented by National Taxpayers Union \u2014 Buttigieg targets Warren, Sanders on health care ahead of debate | Judge overturns ObamaCare transgender protections | Poll sees support drop for 'Medicare for All' Democrats see whistleblower report as smoking gun House Democrats say memo of Trump call bolsters impeachment case MORE (D-Wash.) would require the Department of Labor to study applying inflation rebates to group health plans.\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee also held a hearing, and that committee markup will happen next week. The aim is to have a floor vote later this month or early next month, though there are still concerns from both progressive and centrist lawmakers.\n\nReality check: The bill will pass the House, but has basically no chance of being taken up in the GOP-controlled Senate. There is a bipartisan drug pricing bill that cleared the Senate Finance Committee, but it is also unlikely to reach the floor unless it can overcome some GOP opposition.\n\nNumber of vaping-related lung illnesses nears 1,500\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday announced it has confirmed nearly 1,500 cases of vaping-related illnesses across the U.S., including 33 deaths, since the outbreak began earlier this year.\n\nThat's an increase of 180 cases, and seven deaths, from last week.\n\nThe CDC still doesn't know what is causing the illnesses and hasn't identified a brand or substance tied to all cases.\n\nBut it acknowledges that THC vaping products, particularly those purchased from the black market, seem to be playing a large role.\n\nContext: According to the CDC, of the 849 patients for whom information is available, 78 percent had reported vaping THC products before becoming sick, with or without using nicotine-containing products.\n\nRead more here.\n\nJuul suspends sales of most e-cigarette flavors ahead of expected crackdown\n\nE-cigarette manufacturer Juul is suspending the sales of all of its popular fruity flavors ahead of a potential nationwide ban, the company announced Thursday.\n\nThe company said it is pulling mango, creme, fruit and cucumber flavors off the market, but will continue to sell tobacco, mint and menthol flavors.\n\nCEO K.C. Crosthwaite said the company is in the middle of a \"reset\" because of the public's lack of trust in the e-cigarette industry. He said Juul will submit products to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for regulatory review.\n\n\"We continue to review our policies and practices in advance of FDA's flavor guidance, and have not made any final decisions,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nLast year, Juul stopped selling its flavor pods in retail stores just ahead of an FDA guidance that would enact a similar rule. Ever since, customers have only been able to purchase flavors on the company's website, which added additional age-verification measures.\n\nTrump's crackdown: The backdrop to Juul's announcement is the threat of action from the Trump administration. Last month, President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP congressman slams Trump over report that U.S. bombed former anti-ISIS coalition headquarters US to restore 'targeted assistance' to Central American countries after migration deal Trump says lawmakers should censure Schiff MORE and health officials said all flavored e-cigarettes would be removed from the market until the FDA reviews them and determines they are safe enough to be sold. But unlike Juul's move, the administration would not exempt mint or menthol.\n\nPublic health reaction: Public health groups though, said it was not good enough, and slammed the company for leaving mint and menthol on the market.\n\nThe Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids said Juul's announcement \"shows that it hasn't changed one bit under its new leadership, and isn't serious about preventing youth use.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nAbortion rights group to host presidential forum on reproductive rights\n\nNARAL Pro-Choice America will host a presidential forum focused on reproductive rights and abortion, the group announced on Thursday.\n\nThe forum will take place in the second to last week in January in Des Moines, Iowa, a key primary state.\n\nThe abortion rights campaign group said the forum would feature Democratic presidential candidates, but did not provide a list of who is expected to attend.\n\n\"We are pleased that the Democratic field stands with us on these critical issues and look forward to bringing candidates together for a rich discussion on how they plan to counter the extreme but vocal minority who wants to roll back progress and champion abortion rights in 2020 and beyond,\" said NARAL President Ilyse Hogue.\n\nPlanned Parenthood held a similar forum this summer, where nearly every candidate spoke about their plans to protect access to abortion and other women's health care services.\n\nMore on the forum here.\n\nWarren faces tougher sell with 'Medicare for All'\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) main health care proposal is losing support in the polls, posing a challenge to the emerging front-runner as \"Medicare for All\" comes under fresh attacks from fellow presidential candidates, hospitals, doctors and insurers.\n\nOpposition to Medicare for All was on full display at Tuesday night's Democratic primary debate, where moderate candidates called the plan a \"pipe dream\" and an \"obliteration\" of the private health insurance system.\n\nThe bulk of those attacks came from moderates like South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg Peter (Pete) Paul ButtigiegButtigieg tweeted support for 'Medicare for All' in 2018 Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by National Taxpayers Union \u2014 House Dems change drug pricing bill to address progressive concerns | Top Republican rejects Dem proposal on surprise medical bills | Vaping group launches Fox News ad blitz Democrats have reason to worry after the last presidential debate MORE, Sen.

Those shifts in public opinion came amid Democratic debates that spent significant time on the issue, and a well-funded opposition campaign launched by the health care industry.\n\nThe takeaway: The declining support creates a challenge for Warren, who gambled on not devising her own health care plan, like other candidates, but instead telling voters \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie\u201d on Medicare for All.\n\nRead more on the shifting politics on Medicare for All here.\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nDoctors urge Americans to get flu shots amid fears over deadly flu strain (The Wall Street Journal)\n\nWhen medical debt collectors decide who gets arrested (Propublica)\n\nJ&J agrees to $117M settlement over pelvic mesh devices (Associated Press)\n\nWe found over 700 doctors who were paid more than a million dollars by drug and medical device companies (ProPublica)\n\nState by state\n\nGrassley questions University of Virginia Health System on findings from Kaiser Health News investigation (Kaiser Health News)\n\nPeople with disabilities ask Senate panel: don't cut Medicaid funding (Herald-Tribune)\n\nNew Mexico pot legalization plan would subsidize patients, pay police (Associated Press)\n\nFrom The Hill's opinion page:\n\nWhy isn't Mayor Pete talking about the Indiana program that's superior to single payer?", "description": "Welcome to Thursday's Overnight Health Care.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/drugprices_071119istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
