We recognise that change is hard, and that each organisation that started this journey will have to make its own assessment of risks and rewards of being committed to seeing through the change that Libra promises.\u201d\n\nDisparte went on to note that \u201c1,500 entities\u201d had indicated they would participate in Libra.\n\nIt\u2019s believed that Facebook\u2019s Libra Association members have each pledged $10 million to take part in the project, but are yet to hand over the cash.\n\nThe report comes just a few days after Marcus fired back at a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report that claimed Mastercard was thinking about possibly pulling out of the project.\n\nMarcus didn\u2019t explicitly deny the overall thread of the WSJ piece, but went on to say that he initial (and official) group of Libra\u2018s partners \u201cwill be formalized in weeks to come.\u201d\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
