I\u2019ve been here a few times when things haven\u2019t gone our way. This was always one to tick off my bucket list. It\u2019s extremely satisfying,\u201d he said.\n\nThe main early resistance from England came from Joe Denly who made 53 from 123 balls and Jos Buttler, who lasted 111 balls for his 34.\n\nEngland\u2019s hopes of an unlikely escape-act rose when Jack Leach and Craig Overton batted for over an hour giving the crowd belief over a second \u2018miracle\u2019 after the comeback win at Headingley.\n\nBut part-time leg spinner Marnus Labuschagne finally removed Leach, with a ball that turned sharply in the rough and was gloved to Matthew Wade at short leg.\n\nOverton batted with sense, stoicism and a strong technique, but he was trapped lbw by Josh Hazlewood to set off the Australian celebrations.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be this emotional,\u201d said Australia captain Tim Paine.\n\n\u201cThe amount of work that\u2019s gone in to retain the Ashes has been enormous and I\u2019m really proud of this group and how we bounced back from Headingley,\u201d he added.\n\nEngland captain Joe Root told the BBC: \u201cI\u2019m bitterly disappointed. I thought the way we fought today, the character we showed, every single one of them can be proud of that today.\n\n\u201cTo come so close to taking it to The Oval is hard to take. we\u2019ve still got to look forward and make sure we level the series.\u201d", "description": "Australia retained the Ashes after beating England by 185 runs at Old Trafford on Sunday to take a 2-1 lead in the series with just one test remaining.", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427666794&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870VQ", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
