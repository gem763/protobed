Adam Schiff read aloud his fantasy of what the Trump call with Ukraine\u2019s president might have sounded like. The only problem is that what he said wasn\u2019t true, but a lot of people watching television probably thought it was. Schiff said the bit was a \u201cparody,\u201d which is odd since he also contends the transcript speaks for itself and it\u2019s riddled with proof of high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nMeanwhile, after waiting for a few hours into the trading session, the Peloton\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) made its debut. The stock (priced at $29.00) opened at $27.00 and tumbled to $24.75 before closing at $25.76. Heck, if they could put those moves into an exercise routine, it would outsell those expensive treadmills. Believe it or not, the debut could have been worse. Management crowed that it will be profitable in 2023, which begs to question how they can stay solvent for that long.\n\n2018 Revenue: $915 million +110%\n\n2018 Losses: $195.6 million +309%\n\nAfter the close, the next hot IPO in the cue decided it would postpone its public debut. Endeavor, the mega Hollywood agency, has seen declining margins and carries $4.7 billion in debt. There just might be too much scrutiny these days to foist the deal on the very suspecting public.\n\nPee-Wee Herman Stocks\n\nTwo weeks ago, it might surprise some, but I finally watched \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure\u201d for the first time. It had its moments, including that great bar \u201cTequila\u201d dance scene. For the most part, that scene exemplifies the geeky coolness of the great momentum stocks that have carried the stock market for the past couple of years.\n\nIt had that smirk and that swagger.\n\nFast forward to recent trading, and most of the names below look as if they just flew over the handlebars of a bicycle, barreling into hedges as a gang of pre-puberty boys roll with laughter. Except Netflix (NFLX) has taken a much harder tumble and that is no laughing matter.\n\nThe streaming media company saw its share price top out at $411 on June 18, 2018, before they pulled back. The stock regained its stride earlier in the year and rallied to $385 on April 29, 2019. However, it\u2019s been downhill since then. Let\u2019s call it binge selling.\n\nBig Momentum Names 2019 YTD Last 5 Days Facebook +37.4% -5.3% Amazon +15.8% -4.5% Apple +39.4% -0.5% Netflix -1.6% -8.1% Google +19.9% +0.2% Microsoft +37.4% -1.08%\n\nWhen these momentum stocks began to slip, there wasn\u2019t a sense of panic, as money was rotating into beaten-down stocks (even those beaten-down for the right reasons).\n\nNow, I\u2019m not so sure this isn\u2019t part of that same awakening to overpriced initial offerings that has investors refusing to extend outsized valuations.\n\nIf that is the case, I think it will blow over upon the broad market breaking out. Of course, there is a real question on whether the stock market can breakout without leadership from those names.\n\nI don\u2019t think those names have to be the tip of the spear or the only part moving higher, but they must find equilibrium before the broad market can gain traction and go for a breakout.\n\nPortfolio Approach\n\nNo changes.", "description": "To coin a phrase, yesterday \u201cwas not a joke,\u201d but .09/27/2019 12:23:48PM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Katie Pavlich", "Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/ccba51c4-ea60-4f5b-9d9a-e3a266faf8bb.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
