Now there\u2019s this latest play, with two more planned at this address.\n\nThese \u2018Goes Wrong\u2019 shows have done a roaring trade. Partly because you can enjoy a self-imploding stage disaster even if you don\u2019t speak English. But they are also good value: The Comedy About A Bank Robbery has the cheapest seat of any West End play \u2013 at \u00a311.25.\n\nThat\u2019s less than a programme and a drink.\n\nWe meet the nerdy Simon (Jonathan Sayer), swottish Katie (Charlie Russell), uptight Archie (Henry Shields) and Moon (Nancy Zamit), whose rich parents are making her slum it\n\nHowever, this latest offering, set in a school, I found a pretty mirthless addition to Mischief Theatre\u2019s empire of shows. The trouble is that nothing much goes wrong.\n\nThe action instead follows five kids at a school from the ages of six, 14 and 30, with the final scene set at a school reunion. It\u2019s got a pretty laugh-less first half and never quite recovers, despite rallying a bit as the kids (played knowingly by adult actors) return for the grown-up get-together.\n\nWe meet the nerdy Simon, swottish Katie, uptight Archie, buffoonish Spencer and Moon, whose rich parents are making her slum it at this bog-standard comp.\n\nThese young kids\u2019 references to their parents\u2019 sex lives in a classroom session is excruciatingly fake-naive. Add poo jokes and a lot of shrieking and you get the picture (Russel, above)\n\nThese young kids\u2019 references to their parents\u2019 sex lives in a classroom session is excruciatingly fake-naive. Add poo jokes and a lot of shrieking and you get the picture, as the kids head for their teen years.\n\nIn the second half the script unfurls into a more trad drama about the pains of adulthood. Nerdy Simon is now an insufferable urinal cake salesman; Spencer is a fat loser who works in a pet shop; Moon is irredeemably shallow; Katie is unhappily married to Archie.\n\nIT'S A FACT Mischief Theatre has productions running across five continents in 35 countries, and a BBC One series starting this year.\n\nThe show doesn\u2019t entirely abandon slapstick. It destroys several nylon-furred classroom hamsters, mostly though accidental crushing.\n\nThe two female leads \u2013 Charlie Russell (Katie) and Nancy Zamit (Moon) \u2013 haven\u2019t had a hand in the writing, which is by the three male actors: Henry Lewis (Spencer), Jonathan Sayer (Simon) and Henry Shields (Archie).\n\nIt ends up as an unfunny Ayckbourn-like play on the formative power of our school days.\n\nThe material is a crumpled mess, which director Kirsty Patrick Ward can\u2019t iron out. It feels like a detention. Groan indeed.\n\n'Master Harold'... And The Boys\n\nLyttelton stage, National Theatre, London\n\nUntil December 17, 1hr 40mins\n\nRating:\n\nStrictly Come Dancing fans will love the moves in this play, set in a tea room in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in 1950. There are no customers, just two black waiters \u2014 in white tunics and bow ties.\n\nYou\u2019re The Cream In My Coffee is on the jukebox. Willie (Hammed Animashaun) rehearses his quickstep for the finals of the ballroom dance competition. Sam, who\u2019s older, teases him.\n\nThe pair chat fondly with the white owner\u2019s schoolboy son Hally (Anson Boon). The play feels genteel and slightly aimless. But when the teenage Hally does something unforgivably cruel to Sam, what a moment it is.\n\nWillie (Hammed Animashaun) rehearses his quickstep for the finals of the ballroom dance competition. He chats fondly with the owner\u2019s schoolboy son Hally (Anson Boon)\n\nSuddenly the brutal reality of apartheid is sucked into the spotless premises. Athol Fugard (now 87) wrote this play in 1982 and it has lost none of its power to shock.\n\nWatch out for one of the best performances of the year from Lucian Msamati as the humane, dignified Sam, who tries to save the white lad from himself.\n\nIt\u2019s at times a wordy play but it\u2019s also a great one \u2014 and Roy Alexander Weise directs it with an unfaltering step.\n\nWhat's In A Name? Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford\n\nTouring until November 23, 1hr 50mins\n\nRating:\n\nMatthieu Delaporte and Alexandre de La Patelli\u00e8re\u2019s well-made comedy has been a Europe-wide hit since premiering in France in 2010: at one point there were 30 productions in Germany alone.\n\nThis is the second outing for Jeremy Sams\u2019s British version, moving the action from petit-bourgeois Paris to gentrifying Peckham.\n\nElizabeth and Peter are a middle-class couple hosting a dinner party for her brother, Vincent, and his pregnant wife Anna, plus old friend Carl. The wealthy Vincent \u2013 arrogant, flashy, a touch vulgar \u2013 loves to needle the professorial Leftie academic Peter.\n\nElizabeth (Laura Patch) and Peter are a middle-class couple hosting a dinner party for her brother, Vincent, and his wife Anna (Summer Strallen), plus old friend Carl (Alex Gaumond)\n\nThe Inbetweeners\u2019 Joe Thomas plays pleasingly against type as a slick and smirking Vincent, while Bo Poraj is a convincingly pompous Peter. Laura Patch, as Elizabeth, nails a certain middle-class hospitality, even if she\u2019s a bit underpowered when things go awry.\n\nVincent announces that he intends to call the baby a shocking name; the irony is that the outraged Peter lumbered his own little darlings with Gooseberry and Apollinaire. Cue a toxic battle of wills \u2013 or a mere willy-waving contest, as Elizabeth puts it.\n\nBut as the evening goes on, nastier accusations and revelations fly. Not all of these feel quite earned, but there are bombshells that detonate with a satisfying boom, and the play keeps the audience nicely on their toes.\n\nHolly Williams", "description": "The Play That Goes Wrong and The Comedy About A Bank Robbery occupy two West End theatres.
