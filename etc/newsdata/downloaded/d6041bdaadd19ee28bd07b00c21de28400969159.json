Those four countries would like other member states to sign up to the scheme they drew up in Malta, and see it as first step toward a more comprehensive EU migration pact.\n\nWhile they don't mention the Malta deal in their document, Greece, Cyprus and Bulgaria say the \u201clatest figures verify that the biggest challenge Europe is faced with comes from the Eastern Mediterranean route.\u201d They call for \u201can effective mechanism for relocation of persons arriving to front-line Member States along all migratory routes, when their capacity is either exhausted or overstretched.\u201d\n\nThey quote figures from the European Commission and the European External Action Service showing that between August 19 and September 1 there were \u201c1,369 [arrivals] through the Central Mediterranean route and 4,879 from the Eastern Mediterranean route. Similarly, between 2 and 9 September there were 736 arrivals through the Western Mediterranean/Atlantic route, 480 in the Central Mediterranean route and 2,707 through the Eastern Mediterranean route.\u201d\n\nGeopolitical factors, \u201cincluding conflicts in the broader area, particularly in Syria, entail that we will most likely see a continuation of this alarming trend in the short to medium term,\u201d they write, just as Turkey was given the green light by the U.S. to launch an offensive into northern Syria, which EU officials fear could further destabilize the region.\n\nIn March 2016 the EU reached a deal with Turkey to stem the flow of Syrian asylum seekers crossing into Europe, but the \u20ac6 billion envisaged in the deal has already been allocated and a discussion among the EU has started on further financing.\n\nGreece, Cyprus and Bulgaria stress that more money is needed as the deal with Turkey \"is essential for managing effectively migratory flows towards the EU and its Member States, and in particular towards Turkey\u2019s immediate neighbours.\u201d\n\nThey add that the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean \"should be given special attention when negotiating the relevant budget lines in the context of the next Multiannual Financial Framework [the EU's long-term budget].\"\n\nAuthors:", "description": "Greece, Cyprus and Bulgaria want more attention on Eastern Mediterranean route.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "Nektaria Stamouli", "Sophie In", "T Veld"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1168673134-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
