Mitt Romney confirmed he has a secret Twitter account, which was opened in 2011, shortly after he announced he was running for president.\n\nThe senator discussed the account in an interview with The Atlantic but did not reveal what his name was at the time.\n\nAfter the interview, however, Slate was able to determine it was the locked account of Pierre Delecto, with the handle @qaws9876.\n\nThey manage that tension in different ways: While the president spent a too-online Saturday earlier this month unloading on Twitter\u2014launching #IMPEACHMITTROMNEY into the canon of viral Trump taunts\u2014Romney enjoyed a quiet afternoon picking apples with his grandkids in Utah and refusing to take the bait. When I met him in his office a couple of weeks later, I asked if the Twitter insults bothered him. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of what he does,\u201d Romney said with a shrug, and then got up to retrieve an iPad from his desk. He explained that he uses a secret Twitter account\u2014\u201cWhat do they call me, a lurker?\u201d\u2014to keep tabs on the political conversation. \u201cI won\u2019t give you the name of it,\u201d he said, but \u201cI\u2019m following 668 people.\u201d Swiping at his tablet, he recited some of the accounts he follows, including journalists, late-night comedians (\u201cWhat\u2019s his name, the big redhead from Boston?\u201d), and athletes. Trump was not among them. \u201cHe tweets so much,\u201d Romney said, comparing the president to one of his nieces who overshares on Instagram. \u201cI love her, but it\u2019s like, Ah, it\u2019s too much.\u201d (After this story was published, Slate identified a Twitter account using the name Pierre Delecto that seemed to match the senator\u2019s description of his lurker account. When I spoke to Romney on the phone Sunday night, his only response was, \u201cC'est moi.\u201d) (The Atlantic)\n\nAccording to Slate, Romney has only tweeted 10 times and in response to other tweets.\n\nWhat a total loser.\n\n\n\nThis Sure Looks Like Mitt Romney\u2019s Secret Twitter Accounthttps://t.co/S1nVCNHKlL \u2014 Arthur Schwartz (@ArthurSchwartz) October 21, 2019\n\nMitt Romney appears to have used a secret Twitter account to stick up for himself against those who were criticizing him\n\n\n\nWhat a total loser\n\n\n\nStory: https://t.co/ihKKGWAtHt pic.twitter.com/v93ovXV0TL \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 21, 2019", "description": ".10/21/2019 9:06:57AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Bronson Stocking", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/142/08ecf441-07af-44a0-966d-0ee89c0b3c9c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
