Her one-piece swimsuit broke the modesty rule, the referee announced.\n\nThe young girl, a 17-year-old state championship swimmer at Dimond High School in Anchorage, was wearing the school-issued swimsuit that every other girl on the team was wearing and yet she was the only one disqualified. A referee who was present at the swim meet told the Anchorage Daily News that the official who made the controversial call disqualified the girl because she could see \u201cbutt cheek touching butt cheek.\u201d\n\nVideo: Report Finds Dress Codes Target Black Girls More Often\n\nThe referee who made the controversial call has not been publicly named and HuffPost will not identify the high school swimmer who was disqualified, as she is a minor.\n\nThe disqualification quickly stirred controversy in the Anchorage community, with some pointing to the fact that the swimmer is nonwhite and \u201ccurvier\u201d than most others on the team. Lauren Langford, a swim coach at a neighboring high school, was the first to make this point in a Saturday essay on Medium.\n\n\u201cAll of these girls are all wearing suits that are cut the same way,\u201d Langford told The Washington Post on Tuesday. \u201cAnd the only girl who gets disqualified is a mixed-race girl with rounder, curvier features.\u201d\n\nLangford explained in her essay that the national standards for high school swimming and diving attire \u2015 also referred to by some as the \u201cmodesty rule\u201d \u2015 require male and female athletes to cover their genitals, buttocks and breasts. But, as Langford pointed out, almost all swimmers\u2019 suits move while they are competing \u2015 known as a \u201csuit wedgie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWedgies happen. It\u2019s uncomfortable. No one\u2019s going to walk around that way intentionally,\u201d she told the Post.\n\nThe Anchorage School District announced on Monday that it has opened an investigation into the referee\u2019s controversial disqualification call.\n\n\u201cASD is reviewing the disqualification of a student athlete during the September 6 Dimond High School home swim meet,\u201d the statement says. \u201cWe intend to gather all the facts surrounding the disqualification so we can accurately address the matter with officials and take appropriate action to ensure fair, equitable competition and consistent application of the rules for this athlete and her peers.\u201d\n\nThe school district confirmed to local outlet KTUU on Monday that the suit the swimmer was wearing is in compliance with the district\u2019s modesty rules. The girl has reportedly worn the same suit three other times this season and was not disqualified at any point.\n\nThe teen at the center of the controversy has two other sisters who are on the swim team. All three have reportedly experienced similar body-shaming in Anchorage\u2019s swimming community. Langford wrote that parents of other swimmers on the team have been heard saying that \u201cfor the sake of their sons\u201d the mother of the three swimmers should \u201ccover up her daughters.\u201d\n\nLangford said that last year a parent on the team took a picture of the teen\u2019s butt while she was wearing a swimsuit and emailed the photo to other parents to show that she was wearing inappropriate swimwear.\n\nThe mother of the teen told KTUU that she wants both of her daughters to be valued for their athleticism and determination in the pool \u2015 not criticized for the shape and size of their bodies. She said she wants to see Friday\u2019s disqualification overturned and that specific official kept away from her daughters.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nTeen Writes Searing Takedown Of Her School\u2019s Sexist Dress Code\n\nHS Principal Says Dress Codes Are Necessary To 'Preserve' Girls' Virginity\n\nDress Codes Blame The Victim\n\nLove HuffPost?
