Thank you for welcoming me into you inbox yet again.\n\nLast week, I talked about Juul\u2019s unraveling mission statement and the highly-valued startup\u2019s new Big Tobacco CEO. I got some great email responses and plenty of a pro-Juul DMs.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this on the TechCrunch site, you can get this in your inbox here, and follow my tweets here.\n\nThe big story\n\nThis section might slowly turn into my grievance of the week, but this week the tale isn\u2019t a screed against Juul, it\u2019s a prolonged eye roll after the merger of two adtech companies responsible for pumping the internet full of garbage.\n\nTaboola and Outbrain have merged forming a $2 billion adtech giant. Those startup names likely don\u2019t mean much to you, but they\u2019re both responsible for a lot of the publishing world\u2019s junkiest ad units.\n\nYou\u2019ve seen them. You\u2019ve tried not to see them.\n\nTaboola and Outbrain merge .. \u2018YOU\u2019LL NEVER GUESS WHAT HAPPENED NEXT\u2019 <insert picture of cleavage> https://t.co/5DaTm5E6aQ \u2014 Ross Caveille (@rcaveille) October 3, 2019\n\nThese startups grew their networks by sending traffic from one partner to another and incentivizing the flow of more traffic through them.\n\nBy adding a bit of Javascript, publications were able to bring in traffic and more importantly effortless cash. It\u2019s been an irresistible sell to plenty of publishers, but it\u2019s also been an eyesore for many of them and a race to the bottom in terms of selling the most salacious headlines. This has brought in revenues to publications that aren\u2019t afraid to sell a bit of\n\nBeing an adtech \u201cgiant\u201d is pretty relative these days. Taking on Google and Facebook\u2019s overwhelming ad duopoly is an incredibly noble goal \u2014 I would love for a true competitor to emerge \u2014 but I have very little faith that a frankensteined fusion of these two crap ad companies is going to do much to halt a war path, I hope someone else can find a path.\n\nTaboola has pulled its content widget from InfoWars. A reminder that Taboola, Outbrain, et al. are part of the growing conspiracy theory problem.
