Those other royal visits to Pakistan include two by the Queen (in 1961 and again in 1997) and one by Princess Diana, who traveled there on a solo trip in 1991.\n\nNow, let's pause for some photos of Diana's visit to Pakistan:\n\nPhoto credit: Tim Graham - Getty Images More\n\nPhoto credit: Pool/Tim Graham Picture Library - Getty Images More\n\nKate will likely look to Diana's trip for wardrobe inspiration, according to Susan Kelley, editor and founder of fashion blog WhatKateWore.com.\n\n\"I think we will probably see at least one traditional shalwar kameez\u2014the top and loose trousers look \u2014 from Kate on this trip,\" Kelley told People. \"Diana wore that look multiple times in Pakistan and I think she has on occasion looked to Diana for inspiration, while being careful not to copy her.\"\n\nAnother nod Kate will like give to Diana's Pakistan visit looks? Green.\n\n\"I think we\u2019ll see the color green incorporated [to represent the green flag of Pakistan], and I think we may see jasmine, the national flower, used somehow in her clothing choices,\" Kelley said.\n\nPhoto credit: Pool/Tim Graham Picture Library - Getty Images More", "description": "Princess Diana took a solo trip to Pakistan in 1991.", "authors": ["Kayleigh Roberts"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ewes5PXo_Dn5c9asSCmSvw--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/marie_claire_447/7e11abbf3b64293814092ad33f4e02e9", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
