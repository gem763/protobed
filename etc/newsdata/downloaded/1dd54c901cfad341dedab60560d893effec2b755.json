The company says it has provided more than 5million customers around the world with more than $20billion in loans and financing, while QuickQuid claims to have over 1.4million customers.\n\nIn June, This is Money exclusively revealed fellow payday lender and pawnbroker The Money Shop ceased trading, putting hundreds of jobs at risk as a result of 'poor financial performance' and an 'unprecedented number of customer complaints'.\n\nIn 2015, it was forced to pay out \u00a315million in compensation after the watchdog found that customers may have suffered as a result of the firm's affordability checks, debt collection practices and system errors.\n\nThe company quit the high cost credit market a year before it ceased trading.\n\nAfter Wonga went bust, QuickQuid's managing director Nick Drew insisted in September its business was 'profitable and growing, and we remain excited about the opportunities, especially in light of the diminished competition in the market'.\n\nThis is Money has contacted QuickQuid for comment, but has not received a response at time of publication.", "description": "Britain's biggest payday loan collapse since Wonga could be on the cards as QuickQuid is on the verge of going into administration, according to reports.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
