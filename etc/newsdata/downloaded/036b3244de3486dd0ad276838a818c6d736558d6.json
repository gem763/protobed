None of this is meant to make any sense. That\u2019s the whole plan.\n\nIf you\u2019re confused as to why the House of Commons said yes to Brexit then said no to it 17 minutes later; if you\u2019re confused at whether there\u2019s going to be a Brexit extension when Boris Johnson both asked for one and then didn\u2019t ask for one in the form of two letters in one envelope; indeed if you\u2019re confused about why the country voted to leave the European Union when it is self-evidently not in its interest to do so \u2013 then it all starts to make a bit more sense once you\u2019ve worked out that you being confused is the whole idea.\n\nNormality is fighting for its life with a Brexit project that has always been fully sociopathic. You\u2019re meant to be hopelessly lost. That is the Cummings game plan. It\u2019s going quite pyrotechnically badly but that is nevertheless the game plan. And despite the kind of setbacks that, were it an aeroplane, the passengers would now be seeing fish swimming past the windows, they are sticking to it.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNone of the following is likely to make any sense but we must go through the motions anyway.\n\nAt 7.16pm, for 17 full minutes, the House of Commons said yes to Brexit, specifically to Boris Johnson\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement. And then, 17 minutes later, they said no to it.\n\nWell, that\u2019s not quite true. The House of Commons didn\u2019t say yes to Brexit. What actually happened is the House of Commons said yes to the right to give itself more time to turn the Brexit it had just said yes to in to something else entirely so that it could then, true to form, say no to it.\n\nMPs said yes, in principle, to Brexit, but they said no to saying yes to it within the three days Boris Johnson gave them to do it. That is hardly unreasonable. It is nation-shaping legislation. It\u2019s 240 pages long. It was published on Monday night and MPs were meant to have waved it all through the commons in 72 hours.\n\nBy way of context, they debated the Maastricht Treaty legislation in 1991 for 40 days. And when I say \u201cthey\u201d, that\u2019s exactly right. Quite a lot of them are still about. The same people. Publicly slagging off the EU has been keeping them on the public payroll for more than three decades.\n\nWhen the House of Commons passed Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, but with the caveat that it would need more time to scrutinise it, you might think that could be chalked up as a win. That the request could be granted. What\u2019s a few more days after three and a half years.\n\nBut no. That wouldn\u2019t be happening. What happened instead is Boris Johnson rose at the despatch box to announce that, in fact, he would be pulling the bill entirely. \u201cPausing the legislation,\u201d he said, until he knew what the EU would decide to do next.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

But nobody quite knows what they will do. Because they have to take their instructions, or at least some sort of guidance, from the UK government.\n\nAnd on Saturday, what the UK government did was send them three separate letters, asking for an extension but not asking for an extension, telling them they did want one but actually they didn\u2019t, and now, the UK having \u201ctaken back control\u201d, don\u2019t forget, now just sits around and waits for the European Union, like the wearied parent of an unbearable toddler, to work out what on earth it wants us to do. (This has been its cursed role in life for three long years).\n\nIt is, of course, a complete mess. But it\u2019s always been a complete mess. It\u2019s a complete mess because, almost four years ago now, a man called Dominic Cummings (quite correctly, you might argue) worked out that the only way to convince the public to vote to leave the European Union was to bombard social media with lies about Turkey joining the EU, and how much money it would liberate to improve the NHS.\n\nBrexit, now, can only be delivered by saying you won\u2019t prorogue parliament but simultaneously threatening that you will, then doing it anyway but lying about why you\u2019ve done it, then being told you can\u2019t do it, then sacking your own MPs so you\u2019ve got no hope of winning a vote and all the while, all the while, keep saying in public, as often as possible, things that you know aren\u2019t true.\n\nEven on Tuesday night, Boris Johnson stood there claiming it is \u201cgovernment policy to leave the European Union on October 31st\u201d, 48 hours after writing to the EU to ask for more time.\n\nThis is the mad game. Just keep saying stuff, as often as possible, in the hope that it lands upon ears that might not know that it absolutely isn\u2019t true.\n\nGet everyone stuck in this mad maze, where nothing means anything, where the difference between the lies and the truth is how often they\u2019ve been said.\n\nIt is also worth pausing to note that, even if this Brexit deal, in some form or other, is passed, which it may yet be, on one side or the other of an election or a referendum that may or may not happen at a point at which no one knows, it will, we know, come with a transition phase of several years while a new free trade deal is negotiated.\n\nWe also know, because it\u2019s in Boris Johnson\u2019s new bill, that those negotiations will begin in June 2020, and by July 2020 the government will have to decide if it wants to apply for another year\u2019s extension.\n\nIt will inevitably do so. And being in the transition phase means, that\u2019s right, you keep paying the fabled \u00a3350m a week to the EU to, except you\u2019re no longer a member of it, so there\u2019s no rebate, you have no control over what it\u2019s spent on, and absolutely none of it is spent on you.\n\nThat\u2019s right. By this time next year, if all goes to plan, the UK will be paying more to not be a member of the European Union than it was to be a member of it.\n\nThat, it turns out, is what taking back control always meant.", "description": "If you\u2019re confused by all this, then take comfort from the fact you\u2019re meant to be.
