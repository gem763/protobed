For Stratasys, the aim is to develop the fashion market and enable more than 500,000 combinations of colors, textures and transparencies.\n\nFor the fashion industry, 3D printing can enable a new level of customization. For example, one dress from the collection used Stratasys hardware to print fish scale-sized cells made of photopolymers printed directly on polyester. A Greta-Oto dress included thousands of cells on 27 parts and took 17 hours to 3D print.\n\nA single 3D printer can replace manufacturing processes and machines to save cost and time while creating a real-time supply chain.\n\nStratasys is providing its PolyJet technologies to designers, engineers and scientists to develop use cases in the fashion industry.\n\nMore:", "description": "Using a Stratasys J750 PolyJet printer, threeASFOUR and Travis Fitch were able to add polymers to textiles and create fashions that replicated the light filtering of insect wings. .", "authors": ["Larry Dignan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/11/97757ba6-afb2-4b44-94db-ea9792ad9aa4/thumbnail/770x578/749c7de89a6540dfa0ed18212646900a/3as4-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
