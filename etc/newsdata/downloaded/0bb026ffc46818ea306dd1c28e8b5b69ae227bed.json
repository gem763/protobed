Nothing in this clip from deepfake maestro Ctrl-Shift-Face works perfectly, as you\u2019ll see below. Trump\u2019s visage looks too young and glowy layered on top of Bob Odenkirk\u2019s, and there\u2019s no way for a human alive in 2019 to believe in the authenticity of that face minus the president\u2019s famous coif above it. The voice trick has bugs in it too. The cadence is obviously unnatural at points. The audio doesn\u2019t always sync to the character\u2019s lips.\n\nBut.\n\nThat is, of course, unmistakably Trump\u2019s face. And it also is, unmistakably, Trump\u2019s voice. This is the first time I\u2019ve heard an audio deepfake and I\u2019m surprised at how good it is. I shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 it must be easier to fake sound than to fake visuals. Getting the inflections right in a particular stretch of dialogue to mimic natural speech will be a challenge, but the most basic technological task, breaking down the unique sound of a particular voice and using the component parts to build new audio, has already been completed.\n\nWe really are right on the doorstep of substituting one person in all their particulars for another in A/V media and having it seem perfectly real.\n\nI assume the next step, then, is replacing an entire head. As strange as it is to see Trump\u2019s face in a \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d monologue here, you\u2019re never unaware that that\u2019s still *mostly* Bob Odenkirk. Imagine how it\u2019ll feel when they can swap in the entire look \u2014 Trump\u2019s head, his build, the trademark blue suit with red power tie.
