Less than three weeks later, she packed Verizon Arena with more than 15,000 people who stood in ninety-degree heat for several hours to hear her speak. Such large crowds in Arkansas are usually reserved only for musical acts like Fleetwood Mac and Paul McCartney.\n\nEven NPR\u2019s Nina Totenberg, who conducted an hour-long interview with Ginsburg for the audience, said, \u201cJustice Ginsburg and I maybe have never been in front of a crowd this large.\u201d\n\nFrom little girls dressed in black robes and white collars to middle-aged women wearing \u201cRBG\u201d T-shirts, the crowd went bonkers for the 86-year-old Ginsburg.\n\nGinsburg was invited to speak at the Clinton Foundation and Clinton School of Public Service\u2019s Frank and Kula Kumpuris Distinguished Lecture series. When the event was announced in early July, 12,000 tickets, which were free, were reserved in less than 24 hours. The demand was so great to see the \u201cNotorious RBG\u201d that the event was moved from a modest auditorium in the city to the vast arena across the river from the William J. Clinton Presidential Center.\n\nA rock concert vibe radiated throughout the night. The letters \u201cRBG\u201d flashed on a mammoth screen and a video showed Ginsburg\u2019s swearing-in ceremony before the surprise entrance of former President Bill Clinton.\n\nClinton, who the crowd didn\u2019t know would be appearing, nominated Ginsburg for the Supreme Court in 1993, only the second woman to sit on the bench. Former Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, was the first in 1981.\n\nAlthough Clinton now lives in New York, he still has many fans in Arkansas, a staunch red state that President Donald Trump carried with 61 percent of the vote in 2016 against Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cWe love you, Bill,\u201d one woman yelled.\n\n\u201cWe miss you,\u201d another person shouted.\n\nClinton recalled nominating Ginsburg, saying that when he met her in 1993 he was struck that she was \u201crighteous and warm-hearted\u201d and \u201cbrilliant.\u201d But as that initial conversation continued on a Sunday afternoon at the White House, Clinton said at one point the meeting was no longer about nominating a Supreme Court justice.\n\n\u201cI was just a guy talking to someone I really liked,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nHe acknowledged that when he nominated Ginsburg he had no idea she would become a pop culture icon with her likeness on mugs and tote bags and skits about her on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can become resentful of such,\u201d he joked before Ginsburg approached the stage. \u201cAll of us hope she will stay on that court forever.\u201d\n\nGinsburg, who needed assistance up the stage\u2019s steps, rocked a pair of black lace gloves and put both of her hands up to persuade the crowd to sit down during a standing ovation with claps, cheers and whistles. Two mugs \u2013 one with \u201cDiss\u201d and the other with \u201cEnt\u201d \u2013 sat on a table that separated Ginsburg and Totenberg.\n\nTotenberg asked Ginsburg a series of questions that traced the justice\u2019s life story, from growing up in Brooklyn to caring for her husband during his cancer battle while she attended law school, to her path as a feminist legend and her close friendship with the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Ginsburg also talked about her legal work in the 1970s, especially against gender discrimination and women\u2019s rights.\n\nThe NPR commentator also didn\u2019t shy away from Ginsburg\u2019s health battles. In 1999, Ginsburg underwent colon cancer surgery. In 2009, she battled early pancreatic cancer. Late last year, she had surgery to remove cancerous nodules from her left lung.\n\n\u201cWhere are we here?\u201d Totenberg asked, considering Ginsburg\u2019s recent cancer treatment and hinting maybe the justice should rest.\n\n\u201cI had promised the Clinton Library I would be here,\u201d Ginsburg said. \u201cI feel really good tonight.\u201d\n\nTo that, the crowd gave Ginsburg another standing ovation.\n\n\u201cHow do you keep going?\u201d Totenberg asked.\n\n\u201cMy work,\u201d Ginsburg said, adding that \u201cif I have an opinion to write or a brief to read, I know I\u2019ve just got to get it done so I have to get over it.\u201d She reminded the crowd that O\u2019Connor had battled breast cancer while serving as a justice, and that O\u2019Connor once gave her some useful medical advice.\n\n\u201cRuth, you schedule your chemotherapy on Friday,\u201d O\u2019Connor told Ginsburg. \u201cYou have Saturday and Sunday to get over it.\u201d", "description": "\u201cRuth, you schedule your chemotherapy on Friday. You have Saturday and Sunday to get over it,\u201d she says, recalling advice from Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor.", "authors": ["Suzi Parker"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1491,w_2651,x_0,y_104/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567572721/JNC31613_1_c9imn3"}
