She gave Joe Cunningham a shout out at the beginning of her speech. His district, which includes Charleston, is historically conservative. Trump won the vote in 2016 by more than 12 percent and Cunningham is the first Democrat to hold the seat since 1981.\n\nAfter giving shoutouts to several SC Democrats, including @WhipClyburn and former Rep. John Spratt, @SpeakerPelosi praises @JoeCunninghamSC for getting his offshore drilling ban bill passed in the House.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hear it for Joe Cunningham!\u201d #scpol pic.twitter.com/5kLKiDVeOL \u2014 Jamie Lovegrove (@jslovegrove) October 5, 2019\n\nPelosi put a target on Cunningham's back and there's nothing he can do to separate himself from the Left's impeachment inquiry. And voters are likely to hold him accountable.", "description": "Awesome..10/05/2019 18:44:21PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/267/4eac3f1e-f209-4120-b351-68e1cf258b71.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
