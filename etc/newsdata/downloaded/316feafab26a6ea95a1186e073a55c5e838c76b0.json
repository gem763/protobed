Kinda. The FBI arrested one of the top administrators of FEMA and the CEO of a contractor on wire fraud and bribery charges, along with a lower-level FEMA official today for fraud and bribery involving Hurricane Maria relief. The contractor got a $1.8 billion contract for rebuilding Puerto Rico\u2019s notoriously unreliable electrical infrastructure, which the Department of Justice says came by way of bribery (via Twitchy):\n\nTwo former FEMA officials, including one of the agency\u2019s top administrators, were arrested on federal fraud and bribery charges in connection with their work in Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria hit the island in 2017. The FBI also arrested the ex-president of Cobra Acquisitions, contracted to work with federal officials on the restoration of Puerto Rico\u2019s power grid, which sustained widespread damages in the storm.\n\nCBS\u2019 reporter in Puerto Rico, David Begnaud, tweeted out the Department of Justice press release on the arrest and indictments. Begnaud also named names, as well as published their pictures. He also notes that Donald Trump has been vocal about suspected corruption in regard to Hurricane Maria relief, and that this tends to corroborate those suspicions:\n\nBREAKING: The FEMA official in Puerto Rico, in charge of power restoration after Hurricane Maria, has been arrested by the FBI, as has the fmr. CEO of Cobra Energy (which got $1.8B in contracts) & a 2nd FEMA official\u2026all accused of enriching themselves & defrauding the fed govt pic.twitter.com/bhl2a4hi2D \u2014 David Begnaud (@DavidBegnaud) September 10, 2019\n\nBy name they are: Ahsha Nateef Tribble, a FEMA Region II, Deputy Regional Administrator; Donald Keith Ellison, former President of Cobra Acquisitions, LLC; and Jovanda R. Patterson, a.k.a. \u201cJo/Jojo,\u201d former FEMA Deputy Chief of Staff pic.twitter.com/b8aHHE48ZD \u2014 David Begnaud (@DavidBegnaud) September 10, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s accusations usually are directed at officials in Puerto Rico rather than the federal government. Nonetheless, this semi-corroboration of Trump\u2019s longstanding accusations might account for the light media coverage of these arrests. It\u2019s been a busy news day thus far, but as of 1:30 pm ET, only Begnaud and an NBC affiliate in San Francisco bothered to report on these arrests. That seems a little strange for fraud involving such a controversial topic like Hurricane Maria relief.\n\nTwo of these three defendants are big deals. Donald Keith Ellison was CEO of Cobra Acquisitions until June of this year, a company big enough to bid on a $1.8 billion government contract \u2026 in one way or another. Ahsha Nateef Tribble was FEMA\u2019s Deputy Regional Administrator and assigned to run the power rebuilding effort in Puerto Rico. Jovanda Patterson was no slouch either, being assigned as FEMA\u2019s Deputy Chief of Staff in San Juan \u2014 until she went to work for Ellison in July of last year, a move that might have tipped off the FBI about the potential for shenanigans. All three could face 30-year sentences, but likely will be subject to lesser penalties if convicted, as are most first-time offenders.\n\nIf they are indeed guilty, perhaps this will serve as a lesson for others hoping to corrupt the disaster-relief system for personal profit. It certainly would help matters if such indictments got more attention from the media, however. Kudos to Begnaud and NBC\u2019s Bay Area affiliate for taking it seriously.", "description": "Disaster.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tribble.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
