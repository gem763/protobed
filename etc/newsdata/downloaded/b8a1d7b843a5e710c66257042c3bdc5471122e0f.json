Rick Scott urges Floridians to evacuate as Hurricane Dorian approaches", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "Sen. Rick Scott offered Floridians a reminder that hurricanes are unpredictable and can defy forecasts, as Dorian continued to churn on a path that could see it brush the state.\n\nScott told \"America's Newsroom\" that, despite forecasts suggesting the hurricane could miss Florida, \u201cstorms constantly change.\"\n\n\"They\u2019ve got a mind of their own and we can predict all we want to predict,\u201d Scott said, urging locals to evacuate or go to a shelter.\n\nScott also noted that the American Red Cross, Salvation Army and National Guard would be present at shelters.\n\nFLORIDA URGED TO PLAN FOR 7 DAYS WITHOUT POWER AS HURRICANE DORIAN APPROACHES\n\nThe senator recalled facing Hurricane Michael when it hit southern Florida in 2018, while he was governor. \u201cWe evacuated hospitals down in Miami where [Hurricane Michael] was supposed to come and it changed in the last minute and we had patients in the southern part of the city where one of our hospitals got decimated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe watched Michael, how fast it came up. In two days it changed. No one anticipated it would be a Category 5 storm just last year,\u201d he said.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said that as of 11 a.m. EDT Tuesday, the storm was continuing to produce wind gusts of up to 110 mph and a storm surge of 10-to-15 feet \"with higher destructive waves.\" Dorian was tracking northwest at a mere 2 mph, with \"dangerous winds and life-threatening\" storm surge continuing to impact Grand Bahama Island.\n\nDorian was about 45 miles north of Freeport on Grand Bahama Island and about 105 miles east of West Palm Beach.\n\nSTAY TUNED TO FOX NEWS FOR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF HURRICANE DORIAN\n\nScott directed his message, in particular, to Florida residents who recently moved to the state and tourists who are not accustomed to preparing for a hurricane.\n\nLast week, Gov. Ron DeSantis urged Floridians to \u201cmake preparations\" for a seven-day power outage after issuing a state of emergency for all 67 counties. This, as Dorian gained strength on its path toward Florida.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPresident Trump approved an emergency declaration for Florida and \"ordered federal assistance to supplement state, tribal and local response efforts,\" the White House said.", "description": "Sen.
