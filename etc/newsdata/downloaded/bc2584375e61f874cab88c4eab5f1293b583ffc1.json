Her death must not be in vain. It must spur change in Iran if further tragedies are to be avoided in the future.\u201d\n\nFavourite football team\n\nIn March, 29-year-old Sahar Khodayari dressed as a man and attempted to enter Iran\u2019s national football stadium in Tehran to watch a match between her favourite football team, Esteghlal of Iran, and Al-Ain of the United Arab Emirates, during the AFC Asian Cup. She was stopped from entering when security guards discovered she was a woman and then detained for two days in Shahr-e Rey prison (also known as Gharchak), a disused chicken farm holding hundreds of women convicted of violent offences in overcrowded and unhygienic conditions. She was released on bail two days later.\n\nAmnesty understands that Khodayari - who had been released on bail - was summoned to a Revolutionary Court in Tehran last week (2 September) to face charges over the stadium incident. She was charged with \u201copenly committing a sinful act by \u2026 appearing in public without a hijab\u201d and \u201cinsulting officials\u201d. The case was adjourned and, after she left the court, she poured petrol over herself and set herself on fire outside the courthouse. According to hospital officials, she received burns on 90% of her body and died yesterday.\n\nCompulsory veiling laws\n\nAmnesty has repeatedly raised concerns about Iran\u2019s compulsory veiling laws, which have violated women\u2019s rights for decades - including their rights to non-discrimination, freedom of belief and religion, freedom of expression, and protection from arbitrary arrests and detention. Almost 60,000 have supported Amnesty\u2019s current campaign on behalf of three women given long jail sentences for opposing the veiling laws.\n\n", "description": "Iran is the only country in the world that stops and punishes women seeking to enter football stadiums\n29-year-old poured petrol over herself last week after being charged with \u2018appearing in public without a hijab\u2019\n\u2018Her death must not be in vain\u2019 - Philip Luther", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.amnesty.org.uk/files/2019-09/Iran_1.jpg?U65eW6HffELvfi.TGZDx9Wj79ApzBb0i", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
