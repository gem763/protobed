Peter Braig\n\nGreensill, which according to its founder is forecasting $600 million revenue in 2019, makes money by arranging traditional invoice factoring \u2013 paying a clients' invoice early for a discount, and recovering the whole amount from the debtor later \u2013 and payables factoring, where it finances an arrangement whereby debtors can have some suppliers paid early if they agree to a discount, while those that don't agree are often subject to extended repayment terms.\n\nGreensill's strong 2018 result was recorded before a bumpy 2019 for the financier, which was set up in 2011 by Bundaberg farming family scion Mr Greensill, and was valued at $5 billion by a $1.15 billion funding injection from Japan's Softbank in May.\n\nThat support came as the first fund to be backed by Greensill-originated trade receivables, the GAM Greensill Supply Chain Finance Fund launched in 2016, lost nearly all of its assets under management during this year.", "description": "Huge growth in funds backed by trade receivables it has arranged is expected to inoculate the Australian financier from one high-profile hiccup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2214%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ca370b9bf2ded990ac762e33a88872cf099928ba", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
