We have no clear picture of what went wrong.\u201d\n\nMegan was a mother of four children who were \u201ccollectively the light of her dark life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough shadowed by opiate addiction, Megan enjoyed a big smile and an infectious laugh,\u201d he said. \u201cShe loved all kinds of music, dancing and doing her makeup. Empathetic in the extreme, she was the underdog\u2019s biggest advocate. And against all circumstances, when she could be, she was a loving, gentle and doting mother.\u201d\n\nMegan struggled with opioid addiction since falling from a cliff and landing face-first into rocks in 2005. Doctors believed Megan had experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and prescribed her \u201cliberal doses of opiates,\u201d Webbley claims.\n\nRELATED: Couple Shares Before and After Photos From Meth Addiction: \u2018It Is Possible to Recover\u2019\n\n\u201cThey suspected a TBI, but when they prescribed her liberal doses of opiates, she lost control of her life,\u201d he said of the powerful medications. \u201cShe would be in and out of rehab \u2013 and jail \u2013 for the next 14 years.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, more than 130 people die in the United States every day after overdosing on opioids, which can range from prescription pain medications, heroin to fentanyl. The organization found that 21 to 29 percent of patients who are prescribed opioids for chronic pain end up misusing them.\n\nWebbley called on Vermont\u2019s Department for Children and Families to readjust the way they approach parents who are struggling with addiction.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Four Moms Founded the Hope Dealer Project to Bring Strength & Healing to Heroin Addicts\n\n\u201cTo editorialize, I am hoping that the Department for Children and Families rethinks its mission to be the punisher of addicted mothers, the separator of families and the arbiter of children\u2019s futures, and instead embrace a mission of enhanced rehabilitation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe, as a state, are overwhelmed by addiction. We have almost nowhere to turn. I encourage enhanced funding for treatment in general and using DCF as a gateway for mothers with addiction to get help.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause, as one would guess, once a mother is separated from her children, desperation sets in, even with the brightest and most determined of mothers,\u201d Webbley continued. \u201cMegan Angelina Webbley was that bright and determined mother\u2026 with a fatal disease and a dearth of treatment options.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with addiction, please contact the SAMHSA substance abuse helpline at 1-800-662-HELP.", "description": "Dad Writes Emotional Obit After Daughter, 31, Dies of Overdose", "authors": ["Jason Duaine Hahn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/E1jfVWfEV3qxtXJftmirjA--~B/aD0yMDI1O3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/f1d8d61dbe814a9809ed18c2fb7f4898", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
