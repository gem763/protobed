Some MPs asked why a party which insisted on different laws from the mainland on issues like abortion and same-sex marriage should be so inflexible when it came to complete parity over animal hygiene regulations and customs checks.\n\nOnce Johnson took over in Downing Street, it seemed the party\u2019s grip on the process tightened further, with a mooted \u201cStormont lock\u201d being seen as effectively a DUP veto enshrined in international treaty.\n\nBut the deal agreed in Brussels suggests that Johnson has decided that he will have to shake off the chains of dependence on the DUP, which no longer holds the balance of power since he lost his working majority with the exclusion and defection of more than 20 Tory MPs.\n\nThe removal of the unionist veto, the establishment of a customs border in the Irish Sea and the acceptance of EU VAT arrangements for Northern Ireland are all elements which it is difficult to see the party ever swallowing. The DUP clearly see the agreement as a betrayal. Whether Johnson can implement his deal without their support will be revealed in the dramatic days to come.\n\nYours,\n\nAndrew Woodcock\n\nPolitical editor", "description": "After a referendum involving 33.5 million people, three and a half years of negotiations and a dramatic last-minute agreement, the fate of Brexit may now lie in the hands of 10 Northern Irish MPs elected by a total of little more than 215,000 voters between them.
