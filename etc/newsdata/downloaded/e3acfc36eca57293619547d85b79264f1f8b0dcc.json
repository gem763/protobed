A rising expect the Democratic nomination to go to Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\n\nRBC Capital Markets\n\nIn addition, while a majority of investors say that a victory next November by former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 who held a commanding lead in pre-primary polls until recently \u2014 would be neutral for markets, 89% of respondents said a win by a Democrat other than Biden would be \u201cbearish or very bearish\u201d for U.S. equities.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.61%, S&P 500 index SPX, +0.62% and Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.05% have all fared well during both the Democratic Obama and Republican Trump administrations, but investors appear to fear that a leftward lurch in policy proposals from Democratic Party candidates could be a game-changer.\n\nRBC Capital Markets\n\nWhile the survey showed a majority of smart-money investors growing slightly more optimistic about stock market performance over the coming six to 12 months since RBC\u2019s last survey in June, \u201cone exception \u2014 where views actually took a turn for the worse, from a stock market perspective \u2014 was politics,\u201d wrote Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets in a research note accompanying the survey results.\n\n\u201cMost still think Trump will win re- election in 2020, but those holding that view declined for the second survey in a row,\u201d she added. \u201cMeanwhile, those expecting Biden to win the Democratic nomination fell as those expecting Warren to win the nomination rose sharply.\u201d\n\nGrowing belief in Warren\u2019s chances to capture the Democratic Party nomination for president reflect polling trends. A Quinnipiac primary poll of Democrats and independent voters whom lean Democratic, released Wednesday, showed Warren with a slight edge over Biden. And while national poll averages still have Biden in the lead, surveys of key primary states, including Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucus show Warren with broader support.\n\nThierry Wizman, strategist at Macquarie, wrote in a Tuesday research note that there are several reasons why a Warren presidency could be bad for markets. Aside from populist tax and regulatory proposals that would require congressional approval, a Warren presidency would likely not relieve markets of the protectionist policies that Trump has instituted unilaterally.\n\n\u201cWhy is this important? Unlike Biden, Warren is not an internationalist free-trader. Her platform of \u2018economic patriotism\u201d stipulates countries that trade freely with the U.S. must uphold international labor standards, protect human rights, and [meet] environmental requirements,\u201d he wrote. \u201cClearly, this would not favor building on U.S. trade ties with China, nor removing Trump-era tariffs on China.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Warren\u2019s tough rhetoric toward big business in general and Wall Street in particular has caused consternation among investors, even if her boldest proposals would need broad support in Congress to institute, which is unlikely to materialize even in a Democratic wave election, given the dynamics of the U.S. Senate.\n\nLeon Cooperman, the billionaire founder of hedge fund Omega Advisors hyperbolized during the CNBC Delivering Alpha conference last week that, \u201cThey won\u2019t open the stock market if Elizabeth Warren is the next president.\u201d\n\nHe later elaborated that, of course, the market would open but that her election would catalyze a bear market that would send stocks 25% lower.", "description": "A declining share of money managers expect President Donald Trump to win reelection next year, and a rising share see the Democratic nomination going to Sen....", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS052_warren_ZG_20190925130246.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
