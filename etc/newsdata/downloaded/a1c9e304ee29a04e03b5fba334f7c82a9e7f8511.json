The combined value of the three licences held by her and her husband has fallen from close to $1.5 million before Uber's entry into the Australian market in 2012 to as low as $100,000, Mrs Meares said.\n\nThe case has not been supported by Taxi Council Queensland. Chief executive Blair Davies, who is also the head of the Australian Taxi Industry Association, said the state body decided not to take action based on advice about the prospects of success.\n\nImplications for other states\n\nThe Queensland government announced a $100 million assistance package for taxi licence owners in 2016 when it introduced the reforms legalising ride-sharing.\n\nBut with payments capped at $20,000 per licence before tax, limited to a total of two licences irrespective of how many are held, the industry claims that the assistance did not come close to adequate compensation.\n\n\"Our position has been that the Queensland government should buy that asset back,\" Mr Davies said.\n\n\"Having sold them those taxi licences for quite literally hundreds of thousands of dollars, they should have bought those assets back before they did damage to them.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLicences have fallen by about a fifth on average, Mr Davies said.\n\nNSW and South Australia have also provided licence holders support funded in part by a levy introduced on all taxi and ride-share groups. But they similarly did not aim to provide for actual losses incurred.\n\nIn contrast, Victoria and Western Australia introduced a buy-back scheme. The amounts available in WA offered holders amounts that came closest to the market value of licences prior to Uber's entry but the Victorian scheme fell notably short, according to Mr Davies.\n\nThe NSW Parliament has promised to take further action to support licensees in that state following further pressure from the industry.\n\nNSW Taxi Council deputy chief executive Nick Abrahim said the Queensland case could have ramifications for its industry.\n\n\"We are watching that case very closely to see what transpires,\" Mr Abrahim said. \"But having said, that our priority is to work with the NSW government.\"\n\nLicence holders from a number of states are also part of a class action against Uber launched earlier this year. They are claiming for losses incurred while the ride-hailing company operated \"illegally\".", "description": "The taxi industry says the government should have bought back drivers' extremely expensive licences before allowing Uber into the market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1241%2C$y_813/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ab046faa33d8c21b388e4cdf66e418dd91b03be5", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
