No one has done that. It isn\u2019t in one spot. To the extent that it exists, it\u2019s spread out. You need to approach Shakespeare in order to understand what it might have been like.\u201d\n\nKells is by no means the first person to have embark on a quest to find Shakespeare\u2019s library during the last 400 years. As he writes, \u201cfor every species of book person, the idea of Shakespeare\u2019s library \u2013 his personal collection of manuscripts, books, letters and other papers \u2013 is enticing, totemic, a subject of wonder\u201d. Because \u201cShakespeare certainly did have books, and he certainly read them. Why, then, have we found none of his manuscripts, and why are there no books with an authentic Shakespeare signature, bookplate, book label or inscription?\u201d\n\nThings are still being found and that\u2019s part of the fun. The people who did the initial searching were not very thorough Stuart Kells\n\nHe believes that, when Shakespeare died in 1616, \u201csome of the library was probably scattered\u201d. The will of the Renaissance actor Nicholas Tooley asked his executor to \u201chave a care to put off and sell my books to the most profit that he can\u201d, and Kells suspects this is what happened to Shakespeare\u2019s books. Those not sold on his death, or destroyed or lost, \u201care sitting quietly, in cabinets and on shelves, in public and private collections around the world\u201d, he speculates.\n\n\u201cThere are things out there still being found and that\u2019s part of the fun. The people who did the initial searching were not very thorough, so there are wonderful things still to be found,\u201d he says. \u201cI think they are around the world. People are still finding chests of early letters, and there are volumes of multiple plays all bound together. Play scripts were thought of as low literature for some time \u2013 they were slightly disreputable and weren\u2019t taken seriously. Some of 18th and 19th-century catalogues would only say, \u2018here\u2019s a bundle of play scripts.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Agostino Tornielli book, from 1615. Photograph: Folger Shakespeare Library\n\nOne of his tantalising findings is the potential former owner of a theologicial work by Agostino Tornielli. The book was published in Milan in 1610 and shipped to England, where it was bound in brown calfskin in 1615, the year before Shakespeare\u2019s death. The cover panels on the book include an image of Pyramus and Thisbe, and the edges of the text block are decorated with elaborate patterning.\n\n\u201cThe owner of the four bindings is not known, but there are a few hints. Do the fleurons signify a literary career? That would fit the depiction of Pyramus and Thisbe, which suggests a deep interest in literature (the owner chose a literary motif over a royal, ecclesiastical, political or military one) and possibly a deep interest in Shakespearean literature,\u201d writes Kells. \u201cIn tiny letters, the cover image is signed \u2018I. S.\u2019 No one knows whether the initials are those of the block-maker, the bookbinder, the bookseller, the book\u2019s owner, a patron or a dedicatee. No one has stepped forward to claim them.\u201d\n\nBut the initials match those of Iohannes Shakespeare, William\u2019s father, who dealt in leather hides \u2013 \u201cno doubt some of them for bookbinding\u201d, Kells writes.\n\nKells believes that one of the reasons for the disappearance of Shakespeare\u2019s library is that the playwright was not an \u201cavid inscriber of books\u201d, or much of a letter writer. \u201cPractically minded and commercial, he does not seem to have been driven by abstract ideas of fame and posterity,\u201d Kells writes.\n\n\u201cIn thinking about Shakespeare differently, as less of a literary person and more as a workaday person, it makes you think about the library in a different way. It doesn\u2019t have lots of florid descriptions and ownership marks because he wasn\u2019t that kind of a figure,\u201d he says. \u201cNot only was he on the fringes of what was respectable, he in some ways wasn\u2019t taken seriously by literary people \u2026 To the extent he had a library, he wasn\u2019t engaging with other people through inscriptions, and he didn\u2019t take his fame very seriously. That\u2019s one reason why potentially some of the key documents aren\u2019t available.\u201d\n\nBibliomania: the strange history of compulsive book buying Read more\n\nAs for Kells, he says: \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop looking for the library if I wanted to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quietly confident things are going to turn up,\u201d he says. \u201cWe now see the quarto editions as some of the greatest literary treasures in the world but, up until the 19th century, they were thought of in a different way. They are slight documents, little pamphlets, so it\u2019s very probable they\u2019re out there. We now have clearer eyes to search for these things and different ways of analysing them and dating things. We\u2019re in a golden era of discovery right now.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Shakespeare\u2019s Library: Unlocking the Greatest Mystery in Literature by Stuart Kells is published by Text Publishing (\u00a312.99)", "description": "Stuart Kells has spent 20 years on the trail of the Bard\u2019s books and manuscripts, which he believes have been scattered all over the world", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a46376ce89190df41be55a56e7508af10fa55570/0_70_5565_3339/master/5565.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5b6f7c49f6c2b9e6f8b0f595a36389dc", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
