REUTERS/Loriene Perera\n\nZantac, also sold generically as ranitidine, is the latest drug in which cancer-causing impurities have been found. Regulators have been recalling some blood pressure and heart failure medicines since last year.\n\nBritain's medicines watchdog said GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) was recalling four prescription-only Zantac medicines: a syrup, an injection and tablets of 150 and 300 milligram (mg) dosages. (bit.ly/2IATooO)\n\nOver-the-counter 75 mg dosage Zantac products are produced by a different company and are not affected by the recall, it added.\n\n\u201cGSK informed the MHRA of our decision to suspend the release, distribution and supply of all dose forms of Zantac products,\u201d a company spokesman confirmed to Reuters.\n\n\u201cGSK is continuing with investigations into the potential source of the NDMA,\u201d he said, adding that the investigations include continued engagement with its suppliers and with external laboratories to conduct tests on finished product batches of Zantac.\n\nThe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said healthcare professionals were told on Monday to \u201cstop supplying the products immediately, quarantine all remaining stock and return it to their supplier\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are advising that patients should not to stop taking their medication, and do not need to see their doctor until their next routine appointment but should seek their doctor\u2019s advice if they have any concerns,\u201d the MHRA said.\n\nGLOBAL STOPPAGE\n\nU.S. and European health regulators said last month they were reviewing the safety of ranitidine, after online pharmacy Valisure flagged the impurities.\n\nThe FDA said Valisure\u2019s higher-temperature testing method generated very high levels of NDMA from the ranitidine drugs.\n\nNDMA had previously been found in some blood pressure medicines from a class of drugs known as angiotensin II receptor blockers, or ARBs.\n\nAfter checking the over-the-counter drugs using a low-heat method of testing, the FDA said it found much lower levels of NDMA than was discovered with a higher temperature test employed by Valisure.\n\nThe U.S. regulator has asked ranitidine makers to conduct their own testing to assess levels of the impurity and to send samples of their products for testing by the agency.\n\nSwiss drugmaker Novartis (NOVN.S) halted global distribution of its ranitidine drugs last month.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Zantac heartburn pills are seen in this picture illustration taken October 1, 2019.

Last month, regulators in Hong Kong pulled four products, while in Ireland 13 products containing ranitidine were recalled.\n\nThe impurity was believed to have been introduced by changes in the manufacturing process.", "description": "GlaxoSmithKline on Tuesday said it is recalling the popular heartburn medicine Zantac in all markets as a \"precaution\", days after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found \"unacceptable\" levels of probable cancer-causing impurity in the drug.", "authors": ["Justin George Varghese", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438568442&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9716M", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
