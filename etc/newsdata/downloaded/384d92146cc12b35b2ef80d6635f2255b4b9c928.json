In the 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court ruled on whether a ban on handgun possession in the home violated the Second Amendment. It found that it did, holding that the Second Amendment protects guns that are \u201cin common use\u201d and prohibits \u201d \u2018dangerous and unusual weapons.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn response to questions about the constitutionality of his proposal, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign told CNN that the confiscation of AR-15-style weapons would be legal, and cited Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s opinion from Heller, that the regulation of \u201cdangerous [and] unusual weapons\u201d does not violate the Second Amendment However, Scalia\u2019s opinion states that the Second Amendment protects guns in \u201ccommon use.\u201d Given their prevalence, these assault weapons could fall under the definition of being \u201cin common use,\u201d and therefore be protected by the Second Amendment. At least one expert believes that common use interpretation would carry the day. \u201cThere\u2019s no dispute that these guns meet that definition,\u201d Dave Kopel, gun rights scholar and research director of the Independence Institute, told CNN.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely insane for Dems to get into a fight over this, but we do enjoy watching it happen.\n\n***", "description": "\"That calculation and fear is what got us here in the first place.\"", "authors": ["Greg P.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/7ce64a24-268e-4aae-b1e6-70079a6b628f-1.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
