Blair, 47, carried a cane onstage and used a three-wheeled walking bike on the red carpet.\n\nShe explained her body had not initially responded to disease-modifying treatment and she felt \u201cout of options\u201d before undergoing chemotherapy.\n\n\u201cI was really declining more rapidly than I found acceptable,\u201d she told a panel. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018I\u2019m not ruining my body \u2014 what\u2019s left of it \u2014 why would I put this horrible drug in my body? Chemotherapy?\n\nI don\u2019t have cancer, I don\u2019t need it,\u2019 but I was kind of out of options.\u201d\n\nBlair said what convinced her to go through with it was a microdose of chemotherapy she got months ahead of the full treatment. She said she immediately felt relief from her symptoms.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

And that killed some junk,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cLike what do I care if it kills my whole body because my whole body is like, one big macrophage of yuck!\u201d\n\nSelma Blair poses backstage during the TIME 100 Health Summit at Pier 17 on October 17, 2019 in New York City.

I told my son I was doing this and he would like me cremated,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m here though! We don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d\n\nSelma Blair rocked a gorgeous outfit at the 2019 Vanity Fair Oscar party. FilmMagic\n\nBlair made headlines when she announced her MS diagnosis in October of last year. Four months later, she made her first public appearance following her diagnosis and walked the red carpet at the Vanity Fair Oscars Party with a cane in a stunning ball gown.\n\n\u201cI saw people that were comforted that I wore a cane to a glamorous event, and I just, I didn\u2019t even think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to fall!\n\nAnd then I hear how much it means to them, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, well, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m useful!\u2019\u201d\n\nBlair has been outspoken about her condition on social media, regularly posting photos of herself with health updates for fans.\n\nShe said she never felt the need to hide what she was going through \u2014 especially since she was having \"glitches\" in her speech \u2014 and hoped to offer some comfort to those going through the same thing.\n\n\"I also didn't want people to think I was drunk, because I have a history of uh, that,\" she deadpanned. \"I'm sober and so proud of it ... I'd rather have someone think she's going to be in a wheelchair than she's opened the minibar.\"\n\nShe said she didn\u2019t mind losing her hair as part of the treatment.\n\n\u201cThat was a small thing, I never minded hair loss or any of the things that would be ego involved,\u201d she said. \u201cMy dream is to lie next to my son at night and be there as long as he needs me. And hopefully do something for people.\u201d\n\nMore than 2.3 million people around the world are affected by MS, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. The condition makes the body\u2019s immune system attack the brain and the spinal cord.\n\nBlair said the idea behind the chemotherapy treatments was to jump start her immune system.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t talked about it much yet because I\u2019ve been wanting to show everyone the proof is in the pudding but my pudding is still sort of scrambled,\u201d she said. \u201c I don\u2019t want to scare people away!\u201d", "description": "Selma Blair multiple sclerosis: A year after her diagnosis with MS, Selma Blairs spoke about her stem cell transplant and chemotherapy treatment.", "authors": ["Samantha Kubota", "Sam Kubota Is A Writer", "Editor For Today.Com."], "top_image": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_42/1495646/selma-blair-today-main-tease-191018_aeefc8d51f839cc83777c91730a58b2c.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
