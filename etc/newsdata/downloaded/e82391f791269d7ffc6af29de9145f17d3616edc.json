Wade", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA new study published on Wednesday by the Guttmacher Institute, a think tank that supports reproductive rights and abortion access, found that in 2017, the abortion rate in the United States was the lowest it\u2019s been since Roe v. Wade made abortion legal in 1973.\n\nAccording to the report, the number of abortions in the United States fell by 19 percent in six years, from 1,058,000 abortions in 2011 to 862,000 abortions in 2017. This drop, researchers suggest, was due in part to people\u2019s increased access to contraception, which led to a decline in births and pregnancies overall.\n\nThe study focuses mainly on abortion rates between 2014 and 2017, and does not include data from 2018 or 2019, when several states, including Missouri, Alabama, and Mississippi, passed legislation severely restricting abortion access. (Currently, these laws are all being held up in court.) Still, the authors note that 32 states passed a total of 394 new abortion restrictions from 2011 to 2017, most of which went into effect, and these restrictions did not appear to contribute to the falling abortion rates.\n\nIn other words, the draconian legislation pushed by anti-abortion activists does not reduce the number of abortions. What it does do is force women to jump through cruel, arbitrary, and often expensive hoops to access health and abortion care. As a new study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found, mandatory waiting periods for abortion \u2014 a popular restriction \u2014 can cost a woman nearly $1,000.\n\n\u201cOur new findings indicate first and foremost that abortion is a common reproductive health experience in the United States,\u201d Dr. Herminia Palacio, Guttmacher\u2019s president and CEO said in a statement. \u201cAbortion restrictions \u2014 whether or not they lead to fewer abortions \u2014 are coercive and cruel by design, and intended to impose a heavy emotional and financial toll on anyone seeking an abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cLowering the abortion rate is not the goal,\u201d she added. \u201cPolicy should focus on supporting patients\u2019 health and rights, regardless of how it affects the abortion rate.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
