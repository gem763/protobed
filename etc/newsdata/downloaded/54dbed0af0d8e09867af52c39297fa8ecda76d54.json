While the huddle was described as cordial, several freshmen, including Rep. Xochitl Torres-Small (D-N.M.), and New York Reps. Anthony Brindisi and Max Rose, told Nadler they are concerned the widespread confusion is overshadowing their policy agenda and could cost them the House.\n\n\u201cWe keep talking about how we need to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time, but if you look at someone in real life who is chewing gum and walking, you don\u2019t see them chewing gum at all,\u201d Rose said according to multiple sources in the room.\n\nFreshman Rep. Katie Hill of California who represents a swing district, said freshmen in tough districts told Nadler that they\u2019re tired of Democrats being \u201ccharacterized as the party of impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone is frustrated that impeachment discussions take up all the oxygen in the room,\u201d said Hill, who was also in the meeting. \u201cBut beyond how we each talk about it in our own communities, and paid communications, we cannot control the national media narrative.\u201d\n\nSome moderates have been spooked by new polling by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which found that the public was more aware of Democratic investigations than the bills they\u2019ve passed.\n\nThe national poll found that \"just 10% said investigating Trump should be a top priority for Congress, but 54% said that they believe it\u2019s the top priority of Democrats in Congress,\" according to the polling results, which was obtained by POLITICO.\n\n\u201cThe message was sent by multiple members to the chairman that his efforts are sucking the air out of the room and they are not being cogently presented to the American people,\u201d said one member in the room. \u201cThey are being presented with elitist legalese.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the while we\u2019re not doing nearly enough on health care and infrastructure and we\u2019re losing trust of American people,\u201d the member added.\n\nBefore Hoyer misspoke, Jeffries, a top member of the House Judiciary Committee, said he would wait until after the panel voted on a resolution Thursday formalizing the procedures for its impeachment investigation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get caught in semantics,\u201d Jeffries told reporters Wednesday. \u201cWe all agree, from Speaker Pelosi through every single member of the House Democratic Caucus, that we have a constitutional responsibility to hold an out-of-control executive branch accountable.\u201d\n\nDespite these remarks, articles of impeachment have already been referred to the House Judiciary Committee, and in recent court filings, House lawyers have noted that the panel is considering whether to recommend those articles, or a revised version, to the full House. As a member of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, Hoyer signed off on the lawsuits.\n\nAdditionally, in July, the committee began officially telling federal courts that it was considering whether to recommend articles of impeachment against the president.\n\n\u201c[The] investigation includes consideration of whether the Judiciary Committee should exercise its Article I powers to recommend articles of impeachment,\u201d House lawyers wrote in a lawsuit seeking testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn.\n\n\u201cArticles of impeachment already have been introduced and referred to the Judiciary Committee in this Congress,\u201d the lawsuit continues.\n\nHoyer on Wednesday addressed concerns from the caucus \u2014 particularly from moderates \u2014 that talk of impeachment could swamp the party\u2019s ambitious agenda going into 2020.\n\n\u201cThe fear is that you will be exclusively focused on it, to the exclusion of all the other things we need to do in the Congress of the United States,\u201d Hoyer said.\n\nPressed on what exactly he would consider a formal impeachment inquiry, Hoyer said it would need to be a specific action by the committee, or a formal floor vote on the House.\n\n\u201cImpeachment consideration is a resolution that is drafted and under consideration by the committee, and or voted to proceed by the House,\u201d Hoyer told reporters. \u201cIn either event, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what happened. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s what happened. I don\u2019t think we can explain it better than that \u2014 that they\u2019re continuing the search for truth.\u201d\n\nKyle Cheney contributed to this report.", "description": "The No. 2 Democrats later said in a statement that he misunderstood a question.", "authors": ["Sarah Ferris", "Heather Caygle", "Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez", "Andrew Desiderio"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/06/08/7bb26432415dac7d46be331ade47/19911-steny-hoyer-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
