Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the House intelligence committee.\n\nPer Catherine Herridge: IC Inspector General told lawmakers the whistleblower did not disclose contact w Schiff/Committee staff \u2013 so IG never looked into it. IG \u201chad no knowledge of it\u201d. \u2014 Shannon Bream (@ShannonBream) October 4, 2019\n\nColleague Catherine Herridge rpts ICIG Atkinson told lawmakers the whistleblower did not disclose to the ICI that he contacted Schiff's committee. Atkinson said the whistleblower volunteered he was a registered Democrat \u2014 Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) October 4, 2019\n\nThe complainant\u2019s failure to disclose his interactions with Schiff or his staff could put him in legal hot water, as the whistleblower form he submitted requires individuals to disclose \u201cother actions you are taking on your disclosure\u201d under penalty of perjury. An entire page of the whistleblower form is dedicated to collecting information about previous disclosures so the ICIG can take appropriate action in response to the complaint.\n\n\u201cI have previously disclosed (or am disclosing) the violations alleged here to (complete all that apply),\u201d the form requires the complainant to attest. The form includes checkboxes for disclosures to other inspectors general, other agencies, the Department of Justice, the Government Accountability Office, the Office of Special Counsel, other executive branch departments, Congress and its respective committees, and media. It also includes a separate question asking the complainant to detail those previous disclosures to the ICIG.\n\n\u201cBefore going to Congress, the C.I.A. officer had a colleague convey his accusations to the agency\u2019s top lawyer,\u201d The New York Times reported earlier this week. \u201cConcerned about how that avenue for airing his allegations was unfolding, the officer then approached a House Intelligence Committee aide, alerting him to the accusation against Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times noted that the anti-Trump complainant only notified the committee\u2019s Democrats of his allegations.\n\nIf the anti-Trump complainant did, in fact, refuse to disclose previous disclosures of his allegations to Congress or the news media, he could be subject to felony criminal penalties for making false statements. While a letter from the so-called whistleblower to Schiff and Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, was declassified and released last week, the underlying form submitted by the anti-Trump complainant has not been made public.\n\nThe final portion of the whistleblower form requires whistleblowers to attest under penalty of perjury that they have neither misstated nor concealed material facts in their complaints.\n\n\u201cI certify that all of the statements made in this complaint (including any continuation pages) are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief,\u201d whistleblowers are required to attest. \u201cI understand that, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001, a false statement or concealment of a material fact is a criminal offense punishable by a fine of up to $10,000, imprisonment for up to five years, or both.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: An official confirms the whistleblower failed to disclose prior contacts with House Democrats regarding the allegations of his August 12 complaint. The box in Part 3, Question 1 of the form regarding contacts with Congress or congressional committees was unchecked and left blank. The dates of those contacts were also not disclosed as required. And the specific members and committees that were contacted were likewise not disclosed in the section requiring that information.", "description": "The anti-Trump whistleblower concealed his previous contacts with House Democrats from the ICIG in his anti-Trump complaint, Fox News reported on Friday.", "authors": ["Sean Davis"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1620px-Adam_Schiff_48010682002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
