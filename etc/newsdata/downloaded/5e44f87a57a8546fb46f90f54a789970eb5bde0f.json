REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo\n\nA warning from the Czech cybersecurity watchdog that Huawei\u2019s technology could pose a security threat and Poland\u2019s arrest of a Chinese Huawei employee and a former Polish security official on spying allegations have put it under pressure.\n\n\u201cIt is pretty much business as usual with a little bit more attention to show that we are transparent, open and inclusive and we have nothing to hide,\u201d Radoslaw Kedzia, Huawei\u2019s vice president of central Europe and the Nordics, told Reuters.\n\nThere had been no \u201cno significant impact\u201d on business or major strategy shifts in the region since the concerns surfaced in December, Kedzia said, adding that Huawei is contacting governments and customers when security fears arise.\n\nHuawei\u2019s 2018 annual report showed it raised revenue in the Czech Republic to CZK 7.65 billion ($327 million) in 2018 from CZK 6.63 billion in 2017 and increased net profit to CZK 159.4 million from CZK 97.1 million in 2017.\n\nThe United States has led a global campaign to convince allies to ban the world\u2019s top telecommunications equipment supplier from next generation 5G mobile networks.\n\nHuawei denies U.S. government allegations that it is able to spy on customers, has violated U.S. sanctions on Iran and stolen American intellectual property.\n\n\u2018PRAGUE PROPOSALS\u2019\n\nLast week Poland and the United States also urged tougher checks on foreign influence over 5G networks in a joint declaration by U.S. Vice President Michael Pence and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.\n\nKedzia said Huawei did not have a problem with this and its reference to the \u201cPrague Proposals\u201d on 5G security formulated by security experts in May, saying it complied fully.\n\nThe security issue is crucial because of 5G\u2019s leading role in internet-connected products ranging from self-driving cars and smart cities to augmented reality and artificial intelligence. If underlying technology for 5G connectivity is vulnerable, it could allow hackers to spy on or disrupt them.\n\nEurope \u2014 where Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Lithuania and Portugal are all preparing to auction 5G licenses this year \u2014 has emerged as a key battleground for Huawei\u2019s technology.\n\nFollowing the Czech cybersecurity warning, the government cancelled some tenders that included Huawei, which has since won contracts from other customers including public institutions like Czech Television or the finance ministry.\n\n\u201cThere is a level of uncertainty at the moment,\u201d Kedzia said. \u201cThe level of uncertainty goes out to our customers as well. Some of them hesitate. Some of them say - you know what, I will help you guys, I will give you more orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn one hand, we are under pressure and we suffer, on the other hand we are confident (that) we are going to go through it and we will become stronger.\u201d\n\n($1 = 23.4260 Czech crowns)", "description": "Security concerns in Poland and the Czech Republic over telecoms equipment made by Huawei Technologies have not had a significant business impact despite creating uncertainty, a deputy head of central Europe and the Nordics said.", "authors": ["Michael Kahn", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427954242&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8816C", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
