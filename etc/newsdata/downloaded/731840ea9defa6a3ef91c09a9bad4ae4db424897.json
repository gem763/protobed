Roy Cooper \u2019s veto in a 55-9 vote, along party lines. There are 65 Republicans in the House and 55 Democrats.\n\nIn North Carolina, a three-fifths majority of members present is required to pass an override vote, meaning the proposal Wednesday may not have passed with a party-line vote of the House with all members present.\n\nDemocratic Party leaders said only nine Democrats were in attendance because they were told no votes would be called at the early-morning session. Republican leaders have said there was no such public announcement.\n\nDemocrats objected when Rep. Jason Saine, a Republican, made a motion to reconsider the state budget vetoed earlier this summer by the governor, according to an audio recording of the session. Within seconds, Rep. Deb Butler, a Democrat, told Republican House Speaker Tim Moore that Democrats had understood no votes would be held.\n\n\u201cThis is a travesty of the process, and you know it,\u201d Ms. Butler said.\n\nIn a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Moore said he took the opportunity to override the veto, as he said he had promised to do. \u201cThere was never any notice that went out saying there would not be recorded votes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhile some want to turn around and fuss and argue about procedure, look,\u201d he added, \u201cif they didn\u2019t want it to pass, all they had to do was show up for work.\u201d\n\nJoseph Kyzer, a spokesman for Mr. Moore, said there wasn\u2019t any coordination among Republicans to vote on the budget without the majority of Democrats present.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Darren Jackson, a Democrat, motioned for a re-call of the vote when the House convened Wednesday afternoon. The motion failed, 54-61\n\n\u201cI have never seen anything like this in my 30-plus years in state government. Never,\u201d Mr. Cooper said in a news conference Wednesday. \u201cThis is a true assault on our democracy, there is no question about it.\u201d\n\nMr. Cooper vetoed the state\u2019s budget in June, saying it placed a priority on \u201cthe wrong things,\u201d such as corporate tax cuts.\n\nThe chaos in the state legislature comes just hours after the heavily watched victory of Republican Dan Bishop in a special election in the state\u2019s Ninth Congressional District. (\n\nNorth Carolina has a history of strong partisanship in the state legislature. Earlier this month, a panel of judges struck down North Carolina\u2019s legislative districts, ruling that Republicans had improperly gerrymandered state voting lines with \u201csurgical precision\u201d to ensure the GOP\u2019s control of the state legislature. In 2016, Republican lawmakers passed legislation restricting the powers of the incoming Democratic governor.\n\nThe confusion among lawmakers continued into the afternoon Wednesday as they attempted to piece it all together and different interpretations emerged.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jackson, the House Minority Leader, said Rep. David Lewis, a Republican and chair of the rules committee, told him Tuesday afternoon that no votes would take place at the 8:30 a.m. House session Wednesday. Mr. Jackson said he notified Democrats over email twice Tuesday evening about the schedule, he said.\n\nMr. Jackson said he was told any votes would start at 1 p.m. Mr. Lewis said in a news conference Wednesday afternoon he never said or suggested votes would start after 1 p.m.\n\n\u201cI do not believe you want to legislate by ambush,\u201d Mr. Jackson said to his Republican colleagues in a session Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMr. Lewis said it appeared Mr. Jackson \u201cmisconstrued\u201d their conversation. \u201cI never said to any member there would be no recorded votes,\u201d Mr. Lewis said.\n\n\u201cI sincerely apologize to Rep. Jackson and all of the members of this House for this genuine, honest disagreement about who said what to whom,\u201d Mr. Lewis said when the House convened Wednesday afternoon.\n\nDemocratic leaders in the state Senate have said they will defend the governor\u2019s veto, but the chamber has 29 Republicans and 21 Democrats.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Calfas at Jennifer.Calfas@wsj.com", "description": "Confusion erupted in North Carolina when Republican lawmakers voted to override the Democratic governor\u2019s veto of the state budget with only about half of the members of the state\u2019s House of Representatives present.", "authors": ["Jennifer Calfas"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106324/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
