President Donald Trump praised the dog during his remarks on Sunday describing the battle that took place at Baghdadi\u2019s compound.\n\nThe dog \u201cwent into the tunnel\u201d where Baghdadi killed himself with a suicide vest, Trump said. \u201cOur canine, as they call - I call it a dog, a beautiful dog, a talented dog - was injured and brought back,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Monday, the President tweeted a picture of the hero pooch but did not release the name.\n\n\u201cWe have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nU.S. Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was tight-lipped about the identity of the dog when asked at a Pentagon news briefing on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not releasing the name of the dog right now. The dog is still in theater,\u201d Milley said, using the term for military operations. \u201cThe dog, the canine, the military working dog, performed a tremendous service, as they all do, in a variety of situations.\u201d\n\nMilley expressed confidence the dog would bounce back from its injuries.\n\nAn unidentified military working dog, wounded in the U.S. special forces raid on the Syria compound of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is seen in this declassified photograph released by the White House on October 28, 2019.
