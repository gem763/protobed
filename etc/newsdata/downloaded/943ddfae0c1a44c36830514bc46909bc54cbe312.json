This will give them a great opportunity not only to present themselves as statespeople who can handle the job of government, but if they can act with restraint and dignity this will contrast favourably with the present leaders. What a great position from which to fight the inevitable election.\n\nRJ Alliott\u200b\n\nCambridge\n\nIt\u2019s all about their image\n\nCould Geoffrey Clifton-Brown have been sent home from conference yesterday as a damage limitation exercise by the prime minister\u2019s PR machine? They have certainly managed to put a lid on detailed reporting of the incident.\n\nFrom what I can glean, it appears Clifton-Brown lost his rag with a security guard when his partner was not allowed entry to the international lounge since she had no authorisation. It is alleged that Clifton-Brown might have been heard saying to the security guard, \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d\n\nIf this happens to be true, there is more than a whiff of elitism and entitlement in the phrase. Just as Johnson\u2019s PR team snatched away his takeaway coffee cup while he was on camera so as not to damage the PM\u2019s green credentials, was Geoffrey Clifton-Brown sent home so as not to destroy the PM\u2019s new incarnation as a man of the people? Because of course we\u2019re now to believe that the elite, Eton-educated narcissist has morphed into the people\u2019s hero who wants to \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d on behalf of all those good citizens who feel betrayed.\n\nOr perhaps it was simply that, by remonstrating with a security guard, the Cotswolds MP was ruining the Conservatives\u2019 image as the party of law and order.\n\nJust how shallow has our politics become?\n\nJane Mogford\n\nGloucestershire\n\nNo good reason why Liz Truss should not resign\n\nThe fact that international trade secretary, Liz Truss, has admitted the UK had breached for a third time a court order banning the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia and not resigned highlights how discredited this Tory government has become.\n\nAn estimated 18,292 civilians have been killed or injured as a result of indiscriminate bombing by the Saudi-led coalition embroiled in the civil war in Yemen, according to research conducted by the Yemen Data Project.\n\nSaudi land forces are also based in the country, intervening in support of the Yemeni government which is fighting primarily against Houthi rebels, backed by Iran. Since the conflict began in March 2015, the UK has licensed at least \u00a35.3bn worth of arms to Riyadh.\n\nMs Truss also told MPs that government had breached additional undertakings given to parliament that weapons would not be sold to Saudi Arabia\u2019s coalition partners, by agreeing to sell fuel gauges for F-16 jets to Jordan\u2019s air force.\n\nWhile the minister\u2019s apology is of course welcome, the government is either completely incompetent or it is deliberately breaking the law with impunity. Whatever the situation, if there is any shred of morality left in this government Ms Truss must do the right thing and resign.\n\nAlex Orr\n\nEdinburgh\n\nThe Mail on Sunday\u2019s behaviour shows why we need a Leveson II\n\nThe news that Prince Harry is taking on the Mail On Sunday for its gutter journalism will lead to rejoicing across the land.\n\nOn reading his admirable public statement, what came to mind immediately was the comparably disgraceful treatment that Jeremy Corbyn has received at the hands of these apologies for newspapers for the past four years. Thus, the prince appositely refers to \u201ca long and disturbing pattern of behaviour by British tabloid media ... There is a human cost to this relentless propaganda ... The only thing to do is to stand up to this behaviour, because it destroys people and destroys lives. Put simply, [this behaviour] is bullying ... We all know this isn\u2019t acceptable, at any level. We won\u2019t and can\u2019t believe in a world where there is no accountability for this.\u201d\n\nWell, there could, of course, be accountability for it, if the self-interested Tory government (which virtually all of these newspapers uncritically support) hadn\u2019t conveniently cancelled Leveson II, and with it any possibility of any brake being placed on such despicable propaganda assaults.\n\nThe Labour 2017 election manifesto said: \u201cWe will implement the recommendations of part one of the Leveson Inquiry and commence part two\u201d. Labour will do a great service to the nation if they resuscitate the inquiry, and include a commitment to that affect in its next manifesto.\n\nDr Richard House\n\nStroud", "description": "MPs\u00a0should\u00a0be collaborators with Brussels, for that is exactly what the democratic will of the people was, as expressed in the 2017 general election, a more recent and much better informed democratic exercise than the 2016 referendum.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/30/18/dominic-grieve-tory-conference.jpg"}
