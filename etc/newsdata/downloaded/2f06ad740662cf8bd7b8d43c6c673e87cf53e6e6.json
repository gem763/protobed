REUTERS/Peter Cziborra\n\nImpressed by Sunday\u2019s 28-21 victory over Scotland at a raucous Yokohama Stadium, which propelled Japan to their highest world ranking of seventh, All Blacks coach Steve Hansen was glad not to be facing the hosts next.\n\n\u201cPeople have said, \u2018Who do you want to play?\u2019\u201d Hansen said.\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re the in-form team, I\u2019m quite happy they\u2019re on the other side of the draw.\u201d\n\nJapan advanced top of Pool A with four straight victories over Russia, Ireland, Samoa and the Scots and will face South Africa in the quarters after the Springboks finished runners-up to New Zealand in Pool B.\n\nIf Japan manage to repeat their victory over the Springboks from four years ago in Brighton they would face either Wales or France in the semi-final, meaning they would only meet the All Blacks if both sides got to the final.\n\nHansen was impressed with the speed at which Japan played, as well as their tenacious defence. They kept Ireland scoreless for 60 minutes in their 19-12 win and Scotland for the final 25 when Gregor Townsend\u2019s side were threatening a fightback.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good way to play footy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Hansen said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worked against Ireland and it\u2019s now worked against Scotland and their other pool opponents.\u201d\n\nLoose forward Sam Cane said that about three-quarters of the New Zealand squad had gathered in their team room to watch the game, while he suspected the rest were watching in their rooms.\n\n\u201cIt was probably the most players we\u2019ve had in the team room watching a match this tournament,\u201d Cane said. \u201cIt was pretty impressive.\n\n\u201cThe speed that the Japanese played at, the skill level, they\u2019re the real deal.\u201d\n\nThe Brave Blossoms\u2019 consistency had also impressed Hansen and he felt they were playing like an elite team.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re playing and performing like a tier one nation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re now in the top eight in the world on performance and they\u2019re playing quality rugby.\n\n\u201cJapan should be really, really proud of them.\n\n\u201cThey have given the game a boost, they\u2019ve given Japan rugby a boost and they\u2019ve given the Japanese people a boost.\u201d", "description": "Japan's progress to the World Cup quarter-finals has not only enthralled the host nation but it has also made the heavyweights of the rugby world, including defending champions New Zealand, sit up and take notice.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440652840&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0MU-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
