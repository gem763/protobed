Business is not going to take care of us. We\u2019ve got to take care of ourselves,\u2019\u201d said D. Taylor, president of the hospitality workers union, UNITE HERE, which has had thousands of members strike in the past two years, including at Marriott International. \u201cIt\u2019s been bubbling up for some time. Now it\u2019s come up to the surface.\u201d\n\nIn the airline industry, workers who made numerous concessions amid a wave of post-9/11 corporate restructurings complain that they continue to struggle under austerity even as the airlines post outsize profits.\n\n\u201cThey got all these employees to agree to terms within the shadow of bankruptcy court, then they created these megamergers and are making billions,\u201d said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants.\n\nWhile airline workers, unlike most private-sector workers, must receive permission from the government before they can strike, they have repeatedly demonstrated their anger. Thousands of airline catering workers, many of whom make under $12 per hour, voted to strike this year, pending the assent of a federal mediation board. Airline mechanics, including at Southwest Airlines, have won raises after effectively gumming up the operations of their employers: The mechanics significantly increased the number of low-grade maintenance problems they identified, leading to widespread flight delays and cancellations. (The mechanics denied that this was their intention.)\n\nTeachers have expressed frustration that their districts were slow to reverse the spending cuts that followed the economic crisis a decade ago, even as state and local budgets have recovered.\n\n\u201cWhen the recession hit, teachers kind of buckled down. We said: \u2018We get it. Everybody has got to pull their weight,\u2019\u201d said Noah Karvelis, who helped organize last year\u2019s teacher walkouts in Arizona that forced lawmakers to raise teacher salaries and partially restore education funding. \u201cBut 10 years later, the state\u2019s economy is back, we\u2019re doing really well, and still the cuts are there. It was a huge, huge thing for us.\u201d", "description": "A decade into the recovery, workers say they\u2019re still dogged by the concessions they made when the economy was weak.", "authors": ["Noam Scheiber"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/business/20labor-print1/20labor-print1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
