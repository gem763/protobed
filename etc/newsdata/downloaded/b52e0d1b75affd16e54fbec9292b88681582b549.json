This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Calix basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Calix imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Calix\n\nFor the fiscal year ending December 2019, this maker of telecommunications equipment is expected to earn $0.08 per share, which is a change of 700% from the year-ago reported number.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Calix. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 24.2%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of Calix to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
