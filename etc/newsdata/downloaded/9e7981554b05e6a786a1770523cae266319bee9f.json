Trade associations representing them spent an additional 128 million euros in that period.\n\nIn April the watchdog Global Witness calculated that oil and gas majors were planning to spend $5 trillion (4.5 trillion euros) on new exploration by 2030, a figure it said was \u201cpoles apart\u201d from the Paris goals.\n\nA spokeswomen from Total told AFP that the figures contained in Thursday\u2019s report \u201cin no way reflect\u201d what the group spends on lobbying.\n\n\u201cTotal is convinced that a collective approach is necessary to respond to the magnitude of the climate issue,\u201d she said.\n\nAn ExxonMobil spokesman said the giant \u201ccomplies fully with the requirements of the EU Transparency Register.\u201d\n\n\u201cExxonMobil believes that climate change risks warrant action and it\u2019s going to take all of us -\u2014 business, governments and consumers \u2014- to make meaningful progress,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nA spokeswoman for Shell said it \u201cfirmly rejected\u201d the report\u2019s premise.\n\n\u201cWe are crystal clear about our support for the Paris agreement\u2026 everything we do is to advocate for good policy outcomes to that end.\u201d\n\nBP and Chevron did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Firewall\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe green groups called for a \u201cfirewall\u201d to protect EU officials from fossil fuel representatives to avoid conflicts of interest.\n\n\u201cTackling the climate emergency means leaving the vast majority of known fossil fuel reserves under ground and that is incompatible with the future projections of these firms who are going to massively increase their production over the next 10-20 years,\u201d Sabido said.\n\nMyriam Douo, from Friends of the Earth Europe, said citizens could no long afford the \u201cdelay tactics\u201d of fossil fuel producers.\n\n\u201cWe must listen to the millions of young climate protesters on our streets and cut fossil fuels out of our politics now.\u201d", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 The five biggest publicly listed oil and gas companies and trade groups representing them spent more than 250 million euros lobbying", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/84675d_eu-is-as-one-global-leaders-it-climate-action-negotiates-as-single-bloc-annual-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
