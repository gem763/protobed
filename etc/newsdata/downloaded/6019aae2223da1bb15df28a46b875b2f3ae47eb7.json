(Photo by Gilbert Carrasquillo/Getty Images)\n\nAngela Bassett is nothing short of an icon. And on Aug. 25, she was given the highest honor at the 2019 Black Girls Rock Awards, which aired on BET Sunday.\n\nThe ceremony, created by DJ Beverly Bond, is dedicated to the contributions and excellence of Black women and girls, a group that often goes overlooked and underpraised. Bassett is no exception to that (see: her \u201cWhat\u2019s Love Got to Do With It\u201d Oscar snub). But the actress received all the glory at the ceremony when actress and longtime friend Regina King, who received the Star Power Award, presented Bassett with the Icon Award.\n\nBassett accepted the award with an empowering message about how she found her purpose and remained steadfast in fulfilling it, even through adversity. She told the audience at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark that she knew from the time she was a teen that she wanted to be an actress. But even in the toughest times, she refused to take roles or do things that would compromise her integrity.\n\nAaron J. Thornton via Getty Images Actress Angela Bassett speaks onstage during Black Girls Rock at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.\n\n\u201cMy purpose as a Black woman, as an actress, has always been to portray excellence on the screen, to be proud, unapologetic and without regret,\u201d the Golden Globe-winning actress said.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t always been easy, and there have been tough times, days when the phone didn\u2019t ring, even after \u2018What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It.\u2019 As well as moments of uncertainty and doubt,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what women like my mother, Betty Jane, and my Aunt Golden taught me was that there will be times when you seem to face insurmountable obstacles but that\u2019s when you dig deep into your soul with confidence and fortitude.\u201d\n\nShe received a rousing round of applause before continuing, reminding the crowd that \u201cdespite life\u2019s detours, you are destined for greatness.\u201d\n\nBassett thanked her family for \u201cgiving me the opportunity and the space to be a Black girl who rocks.\u201d She also thanked Bond, BET and the Black women who came before her and inspired her, including Rosa Parks, Betty Shabazz, Coretta Scott King and Tina Turner.\n\nThen the Queen Mother of Wakanda really started preaching.\n\n\u201cSo when you\u2019re told you\u2019re not good enough, you tell them, not only am I good enough, I\u2019m more than good enough,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they say send her back home, you tell them I am home. I am the foundation of what you call home. When they tell you that you\u2019re angry or nasty, you tell them that they\u2019re mistaken. This is me. This is me being resolute and standing firmly in my truth. And when they say you\u2019re not beautiful, you tell them that you are the descendant of royalty.\u201d\n\nShe ended her speech evoking the words of her hero Sojourner Truth. Bassett reminded the audience about the power of uniting as women and speaking their truths.\n\n\u201cWe have much work to do and, together, we are unstoppable,\u201d she said. \u201cAlways remember that our voices, the very power that we hold individually, and all of us collectively, it does matter. Now is not the time to be silent. Find your purpose, pursue it relentlessly, passionately and loudly. Be persistent and win.\u201d", "description": "The actress received the Icon Award at the annual event honoring Black women and girls.", "authors": ["Black Voices Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d72ad5e3b0000b140d0c0a1.jpeg?cache=4mdniu88iq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
