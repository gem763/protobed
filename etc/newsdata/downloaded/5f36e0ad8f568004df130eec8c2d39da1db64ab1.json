No explanation was given for the cancellation.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, the NBA described Mr Morey's comments as \"regrettable\" and acknowledged he had \"deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China\".\n\nIt added: \"We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force.\"\n\nHowever, on Tuesday NBA commissioner Adam Silver appeared to back the Houston coach. He told a Chinese news agency that his organisation wanted to make it clear that \"Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression\".\n\nMr Silver added: \"I accept that it is also Chinese government's and Chinese businesses' right to react to those words and, at least from my long-time experience in the NBA, it will take some time to heal some of these issues.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A number of NBA teams, including the Rockets (in red) have worn uniforms with Chinese characters to help promote the game in China\n\nIn response to criticism of the NBA's initial response to the incident, Mr Silver added in a statement: \"I recognise our initial statement left people angered, confused or unclear on who we are or what the NBA stands for.\n\n\"Over the last three decades, the NBA has developed a great affinity for the people of China. We have seen how basketball can be an important form of people-to-people exchange that deepens ties between the United States and China.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The weekend saw riots over the mask ban, a second person shot, and tear gas fired at protesters\n\n\"It is inevitable that people around the world - including from America and China - will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.\n\n\"However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\"\n\nNBA games draw huge numbers of viewers in China, with millions watching games primarily through streaming platforms. In May this year, the NBA opened its largest store outside North America in Beijing.\n\nThe new NBA season starts on 22 October.", "description": "The row over a tweet from Houston Rockets boss Daryl Morley supporting Hong Kong protesters intensifies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1F12/production/_109145970_nbastorebeijingreuters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
