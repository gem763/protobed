Those who contravene the provisions of this bylaw will be fined,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe municipality encourages members of the public to report anyone who illegally discharges or sells fireworks to its reporting hotline at 0800 555 337 or drakenstein@whistleblowing.co.za.\n\nFor more information mmwww.drakenstein.gov.za", "description": "Year after year animal activists and animal lovers in Drakenstein plead with Drakenstein Municipality to ban the use of fireworks but year after year fireworks are still fired in Drakenstein.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://graph.facebook.com/1470345243209060/picture", "published_at": "2019-08-16"}
