Michigan\u2019s manufacturing workforce grew for most of this economic expansion but seems to have stalled since it hit a post-recession peak in February. Is this a temporary blip? (Nick Hagen for The Washington Post)\n\nIn December 2018, American manufacturing was capping a two-plus year tear, cheered along the way by its most prominent patron, President Trump.\n\nAlmost 500,000 Manufacturing Jobs created since I won the Election. Remember when my opponents were saying that we couldn\u2019t create this type of job anymore. Wrong, in fact these are among our best and most important jobs! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 3, 2018\n\nBut this year, manufacturing has turned south and entered what Federal Reserve data shows is now in a technical recession, or six-month slump. It doesn\u2019t seem likely to recover in the near future: a major survey of U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers now shows a negative outlook, and the other is just a whisker away from going negative for the first time since 2009.\n\nWhat happened? How did American industry contract in an era when it enjoys the support and attention of the leader of the free world?\n\nIn this case, there may have been such a thing as too much support and attention. In part, U.S. manufacturing growth was slowed by Trump\u2019s efforts to aid it \u2014 the ongoing trade war and the dissipation of a small boost from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But it was also hit by forces that aren\u2019t entirely within Trump\u2019s control, such as oil prices and a global economic slowdown.\n\nA more meta answer would be that extracting resources from the earth and fashioning them into tools, tacos and toys is a small part of the U.S. economy. In the private sector, it accounts for about 1 in 20 businesses and 1 in 9 workers, and it\u2019s unusually vulnerable to outside economic forces.\n\nAn industrial president in a postindustrial country\n\nAs a country develops, it tends to pass through stages. A nation of farmers (and miners, loggers and hunters) evolves into a nation of manufacturers, which itself transitions into a nation of service workers and consumers.\n\nWhen the president was born in 1946, factories employed more than a third of the American workforce. In July, they tied a record low of 8.5 percent. One of the benefits of this transition? The strength of domestic consumers provides the United States with a steady economic engine that\u2019s less reliant on other economies. There is, however, a different between less reliant and independent.\n\nManufacturing last turned south in 2015 and early 2016, just as Trump was attracting thousands of Rust Belters to rallies at which he vowed to make Made in America great again. You can argue, as New York Times reporter Neil Irwin did in 2018, that this \u201cmini-recession\u201d explained \u201csome of the economic discontent evident in manufacturing-heavy areas during the 2016 elections.\u201d\n\nImmediately after the election, in December 2016, a broader measure of industrial production had its best month since early 2014. Trump hadn\u2019t taken office, but we\u2019ll still follow his lead and consider it the unofficial starting point for the Trump Boom that followed. In April of 2017, manufacturing production would have its best month since 2010. (The turnaround for both appears to have begun under President Obama and accelerated under Trump.)\n\nFor a while, it looked as though regime change had aroused what economists call animal spirits, or the hard-to-quantify psychological forces that compel consumers and corporations to spend and invest. But at the end of 2018, the boom had peaked and began a decline. Industrial production still hasn\u2019t recovered.\n\nIt\u2019s not much of a bust, as these things go. It may have escaped wider notice if Trump hadn\u2019t brought so much attention to the sector. Production fell 1.6 percent, which is unusual but not unheard of outside recessions \u2014 it happened in 2015 as well.\n\nTo put the decline in context, production climbed 7.5 percent during the much longer boom, which ran from the end of 2016 to the end of 2018. Industry hadn\u2019t grown like that since the early days of the recovery, when a faster, longer Obama-era boom was aided by a surfeit of excess capacity. Production lines idled by the Great Recession had been waiting to spring back online at the first sign of recovery.\n\nIn the recent past, this wouldn\u2019t have even qualified as a boom. For almost the entire century that the Federal Reserve has tracked industrial production, growth at this rate or faster (usually faster) has been the norm \u2014 it has literally happened the majority of the time.\n\nA low-energy economy\n\nManufacturing is sensitive to both changes in demand from its customers and changes in the cost of goods from its suppliers. Some factors influence both. The Trump boom came as oil prices recovered from about $45 a barrel (West Texas Intermediate Crude) in November 2016 to more than $70 a barrel in October 2018.\n\nRelatively small swings in oil prices can send business-investment numbers spiraling. The most recent Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City survey shows drillers can eke out a profit at current prices but that they won\u2019t substantially ratchet up drilling until oil fetches $66 per barrel. Producers have been pulling rigs offline, and Jason Brown, an economist at the Kansas City Fed, said the more profitable move right now is probably to leave the oil in the ground until prices rise.\n\nDuring the boom, most growth in U.S. industry \u2014 a broader sector which includes resource extraction \u2014 came in its largest and fastest-growing category: energy. The biggest drags during the bust have been categories such as automobiles, transportation equipment and auto parts, which are sensitive to both steel and aluminum tariffs, and to oil prices.\n\nShould the president get credit for the oil-fueled Trump boom? His supporters will point to deregulation and the opening of more land to drilling. But drillers saw more sustained growth during the Obama administration, before regulations were slashed. And while oil drilling on public lands in 2019 is up 24 percent from its 2016 average, overall drilling in the United States is up even more (36 percent) over the same time period, Energy Department data shows.\n\nEven more telling? On at least 11 occasions, Trump has tweeted to either celebrate low oil prices or pressure producers into pumping more oil and forcing prices down. Lower oil prices tend to lead to lower oil and gas investment. This lower investment helped kill the Trump boom. This alone should suggest he had little responsibility for energy\u2019s rise.\n\nOil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let\u2019s go lower! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 21, 2018\n\nBusinesses invested more. Was it the tax cuts?\n\nEnergy\u2019s wild swings obscure that every broad manufacturing sector, from defense to consumer goods, grew during the boom, and that most fell during the downturn. The rapid up-and-down investment cycles in the oil industry ripple across the economy, but they\u2019re not the only source of volatility.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say this is all because of oil and gas; it\u2019s probably not,\u201d Brown said. \u201cTrade issues and weaker global growth seem to be slowing industrial production more broadly. He added that many folks don\u2019t realize just how much the booming fossil-fuel sector can drive changes in U.S. industrial production.\u201d\n\n\u201cOil and gas has strong linkages back to manufacturing. They need steel, and they need pumps, and they need trucks,\u201d said Timothy Fitzgerald, economist at Texas Tech University\u2019s Rawls College of Business. Fitzgerald served on the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers during much of the recent boom.\n\nBusiness spending on equipment was one of the strongest non-energy contributors to the boom. Its effect was about one-fourth that of energy and roughly equal to durable goods, particularly automobiles and parts.\n\n\u201cThe administration gave firms of all different stripes a huge incentive to upgrade their business equipment through the tax reform package,\u201d Fitzgerald said.\n\nHe left in late 2018. A May report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service found that a limited boost in business investment was possible, but that \u201cit would be premature to conclude that the higher rate of growth \u2026 was due to the tax changes.\u201d\n\nTrade war turbulence\n\nBy linking his political success to the success of American manufacturing, the president has exposed himself to the gyrations of international markets at the very time that he\u2019s throwing them into turmoil with his keep-them-guessing approach to foreign trade.\n\n\u201cAlmost all industrial production, with the exception of defense-related activities, is pretty trade sensitive,\u201d Ball State University economist Michael Hicks said.\n\nNew tariffs are being announced all the time. It will be years before we can measure their full effects, but we\u2019re starting to get data on one of the first. When Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum in spring 2018, it boosted the fortunes of companies like U.S. Steel as prices rose. But the honeymoon didn\u2019t last. The nation\u2019s second-largest producer has since idled two blast furnaces. It recently announced it would lay off \u201cless than 200\u201d employees in Michigan. Its customers are squeezed by a global slowdown linked, in part, to the president\u2019s trade wars.\n\n[Tariffs could cost U.S. families up to $1,000 a year, JPMorgan forecasts]\n\nThe president has repeatedly professed his love for John Deere, and he recently blamed the Federal Reserve for making it difficult for the Illinois equipment manufacturer to compete. But on an August earnings call, the company\u2019s chief economist, Luke Chandler, listed \u201cuncertainties caused by trade disputes\u201d alongside weather and disease as drags on the agriculture sector. He did not mention interest rates. The company, meanwhile, has lowered expectations and vowed to cut costs.\n\n....John Deere, our car companies, & others, to compete on a level playing field. With substantial Fed Cuts (there is no inflation) and no quantitative tightening, the dollar will make it possible for our companies to win against any competition. We have the greatest companies... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 8, 2019\n\nThis summer, a Houston-based pipeline firm announced it would charge users an additional fee to cover a tariff-related rise in steel costs, as originally reported by Collin Eaton at Reuters.\n\nIn the September beige book, a regular report on local economic activity from regional Federal Reserve officials, businesses remained optimistic, but tariffs and trade were cause for concern almost everywhere.\n\nIn the Boston region, officials report an electrical equipment business \u201csaid that the tariffs had led them to invest more in automating factories in the U.S.\u201d In the New York region, a major retailer said sales had slowed in early August, in part because it had to raise prices due to tariffs. In the Kansas City region, trade uncertainty weighed on incomes in an already weak agriculture sector. And everyone from manufacturers in the Cleveland region to service-industry firms in the Richmond region said they had delayed investments because trade tensions.\n\nAn uncertain world\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to discern where the fallout from the trade war ends and where the global slowdown begins. Especially because one helped beget the other.\n\nAccording to Hicks, the true price of Trump-related trade disruptions will be seen in the reordering of the global supply chain. \u201cThat process of moving commerce around to avoid tariffs becomes very costly, it delays production,\u201d he said. \u201cThat sort of disruption is enough to significantly slow growth,\u201d he added later.\n\n[Trump \u2018hereby\u2019 orders U.S. business out of China. Can he do that?]\n\nHicks noted recreational-vehicle manufacturers\u2019 sales have begun to fall. RV sales have tended to drop in advance of the coming recession \u2014 they\u2019re the sort of middle-class luxury that gets cut first when budgets tighten, as recently reported by Wall Street Journal\u2019s Shayndi Raice. One Texas manufacturer has seen steel prices rise 22 percent since the tariffs bit, Raice reported.\n\nFitzgerald says the uncertainty driving the economic slowdown can\u2019t all be blamed on the president\u2019s trade war with China. There\u2019s chaos in Venezuela, escalating disputes with Iran, Brexit and even an upcoming election in Canada. According to one widely watched index, global policy uncertainty is hovering near its highest levels on record.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who want to hang all of that on trade,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cTrade\u2019s part of it, but it\u2019s not all of it. There are a lot of other things going on.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, Hicks said, when the U.S. economy tips into recession, manufacturing is hit first and hardest. Right now, it\u2019s showing signs of weakness, but it\u2019s still unclear how far a downturn might go.\n\nManufacturing employment growth is slowing, production is down and factory owners are cutting hours. In July, the most recent month for which the Labor Department has data, overall hours worked by nonmanagerial factory workers declined at its fastest rate since early 2010. Similarly, the average factory worker is getting less overtime than at any point since 2011.\n\nTrump has promised that a range of elusive trade deals, particularly with China, will revive U.S. manufacturing. But there is no sign of a breakthrough. And in the interim, many U.S. companies are waiting to see what happens.", "description": "For the first two years of Donald Trump's term, U.S. manufacturing was on a tear.
