My vision went blurry, my legs buckled, and the floor spun. Arms reached out to help me back up, and I leaned against the bar, sobbing incoherently. I wasn\u2019t wasted \u2014 I was playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.\n\nI was comfortably in first place at my weekly Mario Kart tournament at a New York City bar. Right before the finish line, someone struck me with a blue shell, sending my car spinning into second place. The bar erupted in cheers, or boos, depending who they were rooting for. Some people patted me on the back; others jeered. The bartender poured me a shot of the well whisky, but it was poor compensation for the hell I was going through.\n\nAfter the race ended, everyone assembled in front of the screen to see the standings. My heart beat faster as the numbers unscrambled on the monitor. When the final standings came into view, the bar erupted once again.\n\nI had lost. The hit by the shell had been enough to force me down the tournament standings from first to second. Someone yelled, \u201cSeung\u2019s time is over!\u201d My dream of a perfect month \u2014 four weeks in a row on the board \u2014 was gone.\n\n\u201cThe monks! The monks listened to my pleas!\u201d crowed the winner and my longtime archnemesis, referring to the Seiros Holy Monks from Fire Emblem to whom he had, jokingly, offered up a prayer a few hours before.\n\nI needed a drink. The bartender poured four shots \u2014 one for each finalist \u2014 and we toasted to the game, the winner, the loser and surprising friendships.\n\nOver time, the bar evolved into a second home for us. It was where we came when we were down, when we wanted to celebrate, or when we had an event to host and needed a place with cheap drinks. Stepping over the threshold felt calming and cosy. I even planted a Kotaku sticker on the beer taps.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always that way. Going to a new place and trying something new can be daunting. I didn\u2019t talk to anyone for my first few weeks. I stayed in the corner, sipped on my drink, and played when my turn came up.\n\nSlowly, that changed. By month two, I was exchanging gentle barbs with people I recognised. By month three, we were buying each other drinks and chatting about our favourite builds. (For the record: Morton, Biddybuggy, Cloud Glider.) Halfway through the year, we were playing with each other outside the bar, ostensibly practicing, but really just having fun, glad to be in similar company.\n\nNow, we\u2019re a family. Our group chat runs through hundreds of messages a day. We know about what\u2019s going on in each others\u2019 lives, and we give support and encouragement when we need it. And, of course, we troll the ever-loving shit out of each other.\n\nAs Cheers put it: sometimes, you wanna go where everybody knows your name. When Monday rolls around, I feel like Norm or Cliff: anxious to see my friends again, to dish about life, and maybe snipe some poor bastard with a green shell.", "description": "I fell off my barstool for the second time that night.
