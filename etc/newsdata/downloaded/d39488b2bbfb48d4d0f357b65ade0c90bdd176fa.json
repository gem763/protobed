But the developed world is awash in cash, and debt with negative yields-to-maturity now exceeds $17 trillion, according to Bloomberg. Ten-year U.S. Treasury notes yield only 1.73% TMUBMUSD10Y, +1.02% and 30-year Treasury bonds TMUBMUSD30Y, +0.90% are yielding a measly 2.18%.\n\nSo emerging markets beckon, and sufficient diversification may put you at ease. The $517 million TIAA-CREF Emerging Markets Debt Fund TEDLX, +0.20%, which carries a five-star rating (the highest) from research firm Morningstar, held 256 investments as of Aug. 31. Morningstar has the fund\u2019s performance in the ninth percentile among 252 emerging markets funds run by U.S. companies over the past three years, with the percentile ranking improving to five for one year and four for 2019 (through Sept. 24). The fund has been around for five years.\n\nThe TIAA-CREF Emerging Markets Debt Fund\u2019s benchmark is the J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI) Global Diversified. The index is tracked by the $15 billion iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF EMB, +0.20%, which makes for an ideal comparison.\n\nHere\u2019s how the TIAA-CREF Emerging Markets Debt Fund\u2019s total return compares with that of the ETF over the past three years:\n\nFactSet\n\nHere\u2019s a chart showing returns from the fund\u2019s establishment on Sept. 26, 2014, through Sept. 24 of this year:\n\nFactSet\n\nSo the fund\u2019s retail shares have outperformed the ETF significantly, especially over the past three years, despite an annual expense ratio of 0.99% of assets, compared with 0.39% for the ETF. For 12 months through Sept. 24, the fund returned 13.1%, compared with 12.1% for the ETF. Year-to-date through Sept. 24, the fund returned 14.1%, while the ETF was up 12.7%.\n\nThe fund has other share classes, with lower expense ratios, available through distribution channels. The retail shares have a $2,500 minimum and no sales charge.\n\nThe fund quotes a 30-day yield of 5.08% for the retail shares, with a 12-month distribution yield of 5.71%. These compare to a 30-day yield of 4.29% and a 12-month trailing yield of 5.41% for EMB.\n\nThe fund can be considered a high-yield fund, as 59% of the portfolio was in bonds rated below BBB as of June 30. About 56% of the bonds in the ETF are rated BBB or higher.\n\nReasons for outperformance\n\nKatherine Renfrew and Anupam Damani, the fund\u2019s managers at TIAA subsidiary Nuveen in New York, explained in an interview Sept. 24 how the fund is differentiated from its benchmark index and EMB.\n\nCorporate bonds made up nearly half of the portfolio as of Aug. 31. That\u2019s in sharp contrast to the benchmark index and EMB, which are limited to government securities issued in U.S. dollars in emerging markets. That said, EMB is still diversified, holding about 480 bonds issued by more than 50 countries.\n\nRenfrew focuses on corporate debt, while Damani handles sovereign debt.\n\nNuveen Katherine Renfrew, portfolio manager of the TIAA-CREF Emerging Markets Debt Fund.\n\nRenfrew named Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro PBR, +0.76% \u2014 better known as Petrobras \u2014 as an example of a corporate issuer she has been particularly interested in, as Brazil continues to move past the money laundering scandal that came to a head during the administration of former President Dilma Rousseff, who was removed from office in August 2016.\n\nRenfrew also named Fibria Celulose and Suzano Papel e Celulose SUZ, -0.62%, two paper manufacturers, as \u201cvery well-established\u201d Brazilian debt issuers of interest. \u201cBrazil is one of the largest countries for issuing corporate debt,\u201d she said.\n\nBrazilian sovereign and corporate debt made up 6.4% of the fund as of June 30, accounting for its highest country exposure.\n\nActive approach\n\nRenfrew stressed that active management can lead to more opportunities for gains on the sale of debt securities previously scooped up at bargain prices.\n\nWhen discussing Venezuela, where the fund hasn\u2019t been invested since last year, Damani said the fund had profited at times when it purchased the country\u2019s bonds at very low prices.\n\n\u201cOne way to think about it was the prices were so low that every coupon payment made up a very large amount of your total return,\u201d she said. \u201cSo a lot of investors were just playing the \u2018next coupon game.\u2019 \u201d (Most bonds feature interest payments twice a year.)\n\nNuveen Anupam Damani, portfolio manager of the TIAA-CREF Emerging Markets Debt Fund.\n\nDamani pointed to new opportunities in frontier countries, especially those that are part of International Monetary Fund programs, \u201cthat provide liquidity and policy-support anchors.\u201d\n\nThose include Ukraine, \u201cwhich has a new government in place with an anticorruption mind-set,\u201d she said. Investments in Ukrainian sovereign or corporate bonds made up 3.4% of the fund\u2019s portfolio as of June 30.\n\nAnother frontier country of increasing interest is Pakistan, which also has a new government and has signed on to an IMF agreement under which the country was required to \u201cmake the currency more flexible and depreciate it, which they did,\u201d Damani said. Egypt has also \u201cdone extremely well under the guidance of the IMF program.\u201d\n\nCiting the IMF\u2019s importance in establishing credibility with investors, Damani named Ecuador, which issued 10-year bonds in June yielding 9.05%.\n\nRenfrew said she and Damani work with a team of 16 analysts to identify credit opportunities and manage risk.\n\nEmphasizing the active nature of their risk-management style, Damani said the portfolio\u2019s annual turnover can be over 100%, although it tends to run between 60% and 80%.\n\n\u201cOver two decades we have seen it all,\u201d Renfrew said. \u201cIt is a tricky market. If we have strong views we can exercise them.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Index funds may hold more danger than you realize \u2014 here\u2019s a way to cut your risk\n\nCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn\u2019s Deep Dive columns here.", "description": "The managers of the TIAA-CREF Emerging Markets Debt Fund have few limitations on where they can look for yield and profits.", "authors": ["Philip Van Doorn", "Investing Columnist"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GZ705_petrob_ZG_20181205101455.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
