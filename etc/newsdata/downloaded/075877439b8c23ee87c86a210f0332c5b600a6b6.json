Manchin mulled another run for the governor\u2019s mansion. He made his final decision today: he\u2019s not going to do it. In doing so, Manchin doesn\u2019t put a seat at risk for the 2020 cycle. Manchin appears to be the only Democrat who has survived his state\u2019s massive red-leaning shift. The state used to be a bastion of blue-collar Democrats. At times, the state legislature was overwhelmingly Democratic. It wasn\u2019t until 2014 that Republicans retook both houses of the legislature. It\u2019s deep Trump country; he won with 68.5 percent of the vote. But Manchin has been able to survive comfortably. He holds a 49 percent approval rating right now. It\u2019s not the best, but more than enough to be crowned the favorite to win the governorship in 2020 if he had decided to toss his hat in the ring (via CBS News):\n\nJUST IN: Joe Manchin plans to stay in the U.S. Senate and will not run again next year for his old job as West Virginia governor, an aide tells @CBSNews \u2014 Ed O'Keefe (@edokeefe) September 3, 2019\n\nSenator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, does not plan to run again for his old job as governor and will remain in the U.S. Senate. Manchin had been toying for most of the summer with a possible campaign for his old job, which he left in 2010 after winning a special election for the Senate seat of the late Senator Robert C. Byrd, also a Democrat. The decision means Manchin, one of the few bipartisan power brokers left in the sharply divided Senate, will remain in Washington as a potential emissary between the two parties on tricky issues including gun control and other domestic issues. But Manchin hasn't shied away from criticizing his own party for its leftward lurch and is expected to continue expressing concerns with the campaigns and viewpoints of liberal presidential candidates, including his Senate colleagues Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, and Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. Manchin's decision was not an obvious one: CBS News reported that aides to Manchin were preparing drafts of two possible statements late Monday: One that signaled his intention to stay in the Senate and another announcing plans to run again for governor.\n\nManchin is one of the last red-state Democrats on the Hill. He\u2019s a Democrat who, wait for it, isn\u2019t totally insane. He will vote for whatever is best for his state. He\u2019s not a progressive left-winger. He\u2019s held positions that you could describe as pro-life, anti-EPA, and pro-gun rights. He did get behind a universal background check bill\u2014Manchin-Toomey\u2014which drew the ire of the Second Amendment crowd and the National Rifle Association, but he\u2019s not a Moms Demand anti-gunner either. He\u2019s a solid retail politician; even West Virginia Republicans like him. Manchin has more than once warned Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) that if red-state Democrats are wiped out, it will be very hard for the party to win elections. And a far-left extremist agenda that\u2019s being peddled right now for the 2020 crop just shows that the party seems to be heading in that direction. Manchin could be the loneliest Democrat in the Senate. His votes for Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh certainly didn\u2019t earn him any love from the Left, but as he said many times\u2014re-election isn\u2019t on his mind all the time. If he\u2019s voted out, he\u2019ll happily go home. In the meantime, he\u2019s the voice for the last sliver of Democrats who aren\u2019t caught up in the cancel/political correctness culture that\u2019s infested liberal politics.", "description": ".09/03/2019 19:37:57PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/232/2e36a60a-98d3-480a-b7ad-9f5e6d9a8a3c.png"}
