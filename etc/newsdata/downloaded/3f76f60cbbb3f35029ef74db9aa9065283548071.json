Her post was shared more than 17,000 times and she received a barrage of messages demanding she delete her post, which she eventually did.\n\nSammy j williams (@Sammyjwilliams3) Please feed the ducks pic.twitter.com/OIaGhzmsY2\n\nThe photo also appeared on Reddit under the title \u201cI\u2019m confused about duck diet now\u201d and has garnered more than 39,000 likes and 1,500 comments.\n\nOther signs shared on social media in the past have asked people explicitly not to feed ducks with bread, claiming it made them ill. One sign encouraged people to feed ducks with \u201chalf-cut seedless grapes, cooked rice, birdseed ( any type of mix), peas, corn, oats, chopped lettuce\u201d, which was then derided as creating a \u201cnew generation of gluten free hipster ducks\u201d.\n\nAnother sign shared to a local Facebook group for mothers, with more than 17,000 members, claimed feeding bread can cause a condition called \u201cangel wing\u201d, which makes ducks unable to fly, as well as \u201cfatal gut and heart disease\u201d in swans.\n\nEven experts seem unable to agree on the matter. A spokesperson for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) said: \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to hear that people want to help swans, ducks and geese, however it is important to make sure they are given the right food.\n\n\u201cBread in itself is not the best food to give waterfowl as it fills them up without giving them the nutrients they need. We recommend people instead give small amounts of grain such as wheat, corn or bird seed, plus fresh chopped greens like cabbage or spinach, as these will supplement the birds\u2019 natural diet and help provide the birds with the necessary nutrients to keep them healthy.\u201d\n\nThe Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) said feeding small amounts of bread to ducks and swans was fine and not harmful, and that it was important that members of the public fed birds, as society becomes increasingly disconnected with nature.\n\nA spokesperson said: \u201cJust like us, birds need a varied diet to stay healthy. Although ducks and swans can digest all types of bread, too much can leave them feeling full without giving them all of the important vitamins, minerals and nutrients they need.\n\n\u201cSo, although bread isn\u2019t harmful, our advice is to only feed small amounts to birds. As an alternative we encourage people to use things like sweetcorn, porridge oats, crumbled biscuits and defrosted frozen peas as well as bird seed.\u201d\n\nSwanSupport, a charity that rescues swans, ducks and geese, insists that feeding them bread is fine and told the BBC that many birds \u201cdie from starvation\u201d because people have been discouraged from giving them bread.", "description": "Experts and commenters disagree over whether bread makes ducks and swans ill or helps them through the winter", "authors": ["Jedidajah Otte"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c90346b7e57d28526acfdff3458af6e58aa24703/0_278_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=97c7c613ff5bd85ae81d14265b8b18f0", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
