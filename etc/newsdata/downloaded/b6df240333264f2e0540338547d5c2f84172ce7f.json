Japan host matches in the Rugby World Cup this weekend, as well as the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka and officials from both bodies are being kept appraised to the situation as it develops.\n\nThe situation is particularly concerning for the Ireland rugby team who play Samoa in Fukuoka on Saturday. Joe Schmidt's side require a bonus point victory to ensure passage to the quarter-finals but rules state that if a game is canceled then it can't be rescheduled. Instead, the fixture is recorded as a draw and the two points Ireland would take would likely be insufficient to qualify for the quarter-finals.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis explodes into a beast of a storm. pic.twitter.com/agNZ2EeYQa \u2014 Dakota Smith (@weatherdak) October 7, 2019\n\nIreland defense coach Andy Farrell confirmed that World Rugby has been in communication with the Ireland camp, saying that they are as \"keen as we are to get this game played\".\n\n\"The weather forecast changes all the time anyway, so we won't probably know until 48 hours out from the game,\" he added.\n\n\"The boys haven't even spoken about it - we just go from day to day, get on with our preparations.\"\n\nThe Scottish rugby team, who face Japan in Tokyo this weekend, offered up a more simple response when questioned about the potential of a game taking place in stormy conditions.\n\n\"We're from Scotland. Rain. Hail. It doesn't matter. We've coped with a lot more,\" said prop Gordon Reid.\n\n\"We're from Ayrshire and Glasgow and Edinburgh, well they're a bit posh in Edinburgh but rain, shine, snow, whatever, it doesn't matter.\"\n\nAlso on rt.com Dance like Diego: Maradona celebrates first win as Gimnasia boss with dressing room boogie (VIDEO)\n\nMeanwhile, the FIA is also keeping a watchful eye on the situation ahead of this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka.
