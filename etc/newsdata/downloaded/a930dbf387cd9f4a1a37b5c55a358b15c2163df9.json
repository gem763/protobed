I'd be ashamed of myself if I opted to have her childhood pictures edited to make her \"prettier\".\n\n'We should be teaching children to be happy and confident in their own skin and love themselves! Disgraceful'\n\nAnother wrote: 'And you wonder why some people will suffer from mental illness. Children need to accept that some photos are not going to be perfect. So wrong. Such a shame.\n\nFurious fans of the show took to Twitter to vent today amid a discussion on today's episode about whether it's okay to edit your child's photo, with one insisting the photographer should be 'ashamed' of themselves\n\n'Actually the parents need to accept that their little darlings may not have the perfect photograph.'\n\nA third furious parent commented: ' The photographers who offered the service should be held accountable and ashamed of themselves!\n\n'We already have filters ruining young minds, this is just exacerbating and normalising the issue of body image, even more.'\n\nSam , who is originally from the UK but now lives in the US, took to Twitter and alongside an image of the form, penned: 'The girls have their school photo today and there is the option to AIRBRUSH the picture!'\n\n'There are two levels offered!! What the....?! Have complained! What eight-year-old needs to be paranoid about an \u201cuneven skin tone.\u201d\n\nIt wasn't just Loose Women viewers who were angry over the form and the BBC Radio 5 Live presenter's followers quickly took to the comments section to express their shock at the options on offer.\n\n'That's absolutely disgusting!! Yes WTF ,' raged one, while another wrote: 'Good grief. What an awful message to send to children. And from a school.'\n\nSam Walker, who is originally from the UK, took to Twitter to share the form her daughters brought home - which gave her the option to airbrush their school photos\n\nSam took to Twitter and told how she has since complained to the school. 'What eight-year-old needs to be paranoid about an \"uneven skin tone,\"' she added\n\nA third added: 'Yet another example of, \"Just because you can, doesn't mean you should,\" while a fourth added: 'Seems like a lot of hassle for whiter teeth and a couple of zits.'\n\nAnother who was left outraged by the suggestion went on to say how the entire point of a school photo is to 'look back and laugh at how goofy' they are.\n\n'I love the horrible lighting and flaws captured at Valentine Elementary School in San Marino, CA! Just BE kids!!' she continued.\n\nMeanwhile, others slammed the wrong message it is sending out to their children - who are young enough to still be in primary school.\n\nMany agreed that the option to airbrush is giving the wrong impression to young children across the globe\n\n'What does this teach children???? It\u2019s nonsense!!' wrote one, while a second added:\n\n'We were all paranoid about those things, but we didn't have the message shoved down our throats that these things are so important they need to be covered up for us to be seen public. I worry what Instagram is doing to kids.'\n\nMeanwhile, another took the opportunity to praise the photographer her granddaughter - who has scars on her chest - had at her school.\n\n'What a dreadful idea,' she said. 'Our granddaughter (5) had her school pictures done she has scars on her face and skin grafts on her chest.\n\n'The photographer did a brilliant job taking pictures of her not showing any of the burned areas, so it can be done with out the air brush.'", "description": "British presenter Sam Walker was given the option to 'airbrush' her eight-year-old daughter's photo at her school in the US, and today Loose Women viewers said it was 'disgraceful'.", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline", "Chloe Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/14/20327890-0-image-a-10_1572358687479.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
