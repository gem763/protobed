Joshua Lott/Pool via Reuters\n\nRead more: Boeing executives reportedly rejected a safety system in the 737 Max because it was too expensive\n\n\"With adequate FAA engagement and oversight, the extent of delegation does not in itself compromise safety,\" the report said. \"However, in the B737 Max program, the FAA had inadequate awareness of the MCAS function which, coupled with limited involvement, resulted in an inability of the FAA to provide an independent assessment of the adequacy of the Boeing-proposed certification activities associated with MCAS.\"\n\nThe report also questioned the FAA's limited staffing to oversee certification tasks it designated to Boeing and said there were an \"inadequate number of FAA specialists\" involved in the 737 Max certification.\n\nIt added there were signs that Boeing employees conducting FAA work faced \"undue pressure ... which may be attributed to conflicting priorities and an environment that does not support FAA requirements.\"\n\nFAA Administrator Steve Dickson said in a statement he would look at the panel's recommendations and take appropriate action following the \"unvarnished and independent review of the certification of the Boeing 737 Max.\"\n\nBoeing said it had no immediate comment ahead of the report's public release.\n\nThe MCAS software has been blamed for 2 deadly crashes\n\nThe Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, on March 27. REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson/File Photo\n\nThe US planemaker has stopped short of admitting any faults in how it developed the 737 Max, or MCAS, which repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down in the Ethiopia and Indonesia crashes while the pilots struggled to intervene.\n\nHowever, it has said the feeding of erroneous so-called angle-of-attack data to MCAS \u2014 the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System \u2014 was a common link in two wider chains of events leading to the crashes.\n\nThe JATR report recommended that the FAA review the stalling characteristics of the 737 Max without MCAS and associated systems to determine whether unsafe characteristics existed and, if so, whether a broader review of the system design was needed.\n\nJATR said MCAS and those systems could be considered a stall identification or stall protection system, depending on how the aircraft handled without them.\n\nBoeing has said MCAS was not meant to prevent stalls and was instead designed so the 737 Max would have similar handling characteristics to its predecessor, the 737 NG.\n\nThe European Union Aviation Safety Agency last month said it planned to undertake flight tests of the 737 Max including a test without MCAS to check its performance during high-speed turns and stall.\n\nRead more: Airlines have been flying empty Boeing 737 Max planes around the world as they scramble to get ready for its return to service\n\nBoeing is revising the 737 Max software to require the MCAS software to receive input from both AOA sensors and has added additional safeguards. FAA Deputy Administrator Dan Elwell said last month that if the AOA sensors differed by 5.5 degrees or more, then MCAS could not operate. If MCAS does operate, it can operate only once unless the problem had been \"completely resolved,\" he added.\n\nThe JATR is headed by Christopher Hart, the former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, and includes air-safety regulators from the United States, Canada, China, Indonesia, the European Union, Brazil, Australia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and Japan.\n\nLast month, Hart said it was important to note \"the US aviation system each day transports millions of people safely, so it's not like we have to completely overhaul the entire system, it's not broken.\" He continued: \"But these incidents have shown us that there are ways to improve the existing system.\"", "description": "The Federal Aviation Administration commissioned the review in April to look into its oversight and approval of the system linked to two crashes.", "authors": ["David Shepherdson", "Jamie Freed"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d279c62a17d6c4d723bd453?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
