I also took tons of medication to help the pain.'\n\nEmma joined the army as a gunner with the Royal Artillery when she was 18 and saw active service in Iraq in 2003.\n\nEmma (pictured walking on her big day) put in hours of leg strength straining so she could make the 20ft journey to the alter without her wheelchair\n\nEmma pictured on her special day as she sits on the dance floor surrounded by her guests\n\nAs one of a very small number of female gunners, she wanted to prove herself and 'keep up with the lads' - not realising the 100lb shells - AS90 bullets for tanks - she was carrying on her back were slowly damaging her spine.\n\nShe left the army aged 21, when the pain in her back became too much for her.\n\nIt became progressively worse throughout her twenties and doctors at Leeds General Infirmary told her they had no choice but to operate to try to repair the damage.\n\nEmma said: 'I wasn't prepared for what would happen. I was told there was only a four per cent chance I wouldn't be able to walk. I woke up and couldn't feel my left leg.'\n\nShe left hospital in a wheelchair and has been using one ever since.\n\nEmma (pictured right) during her days in the Army.

'Some of them have lost limbs and it just put my life into perspective.'\n\nThe games gave her back her confidence and gave her the strength to leave an unhappy relationship.\n\nShe met Chris while training for the 2017 Invictus Games - an international multi-sport event, created by Prince Harry, for wounded, injured or sick armed services personnel - and he made her feel like 'life was worth living again'.\n\nThe couple now live in Halifax with their daughter Charlotte and Emma's children from a previous relationship, Kiera, 14, and Archie, 10.\n\nEmma (pictured on her big day) said: 'Right now I am really happy that I ended my single life walking, and started my married life walking'\n\nDespite her injuries Emma has never sought compensation from the Ministry of Defence or the hospital who performed her surgery.\n\nShe said: 'There is too much of a compensation culture and I didn't want to bog myself down in destructive fights against organisations struggling for money.\n\n'I know soldiers who have been in this situation and I've seen it's not worth the battle. I have been offered another operation but I don't want to do it, I feel I am managing as I am. At least I have feeling in my legs.\n\n'Instead I get on with living a happy life, I work hard and set a good example for my children. I am now more active than I have ever been, and my children are also achieving their own sporting goals.\n\n'Yes, I am in constant pain and on so many pain killers that I would rattle if you shook me, but I get on with my life and I enjoy it.\n\n'Right now I am really happy that I ended my single life walking, and started my married life walking. I do not see myself as an inspiration. I make my own inspiration. Everybody can be their own inspiration, you can achieve your dreams.'", "description": "Emma Kitson, 35, from West Yorkshire,\u00a0joined the Royal Artillery when she was 18  - but the heavy shells she carried on her back slowly crushed her spine and she was left in a wheelchair.", "authors": ["Jessica Green For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/15/20333140-0-image-a-7_1572363659149.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
