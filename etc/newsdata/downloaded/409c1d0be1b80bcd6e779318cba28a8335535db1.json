We have replaced many miles of old Barrier with powerful new Walls!\" Trump tweeted in July.\n\n\"The Wall is going up very fast despite total Obstruction by Democrats in Congress, and elsewhere!\" he wrote last week.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday that Trump's was pursuing the wall \"to boost his own ego\" and called it \"a slap in the face to the members of the Armed Forces\".\n\nWhile Pentagon chief Esper's go-ahead signaled a likely surge in new wall building work immediately, the project could face more legal challenges.\n\nJack Reed, the senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called for Congress to oppose \"misusing defense dollars in this manner\".\n\n\"Clearly, this administration is trying to circumvent Congressional authority and this ill-advised attempt should be legally challenged and struck down by the courts,\" Reed said in a statement.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union meanwhile said it would sue on the grounds of abuse of power by Trump.\n\n\"The fact that the government sat on these so-called 'emergency funds' for seven months further confirms that this is nothing but an unlawful power grab,\" said ACLU staff attorney Dror Ladin.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
