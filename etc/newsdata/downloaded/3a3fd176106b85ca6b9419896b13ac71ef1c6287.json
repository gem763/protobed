That leaves the Liberals short of the 170 seats needed for a majority \u2014 and dependent on the support of the NDP and the resurgent Bloc Quebecois to pass legislation. The Bloc tripled its seat count to 32 while Jagmeet Singh\u2019s NDP took 24 seats, down from 39.\n\n\u201cThere still will be some uncertainty, typically minority governments don\u2019t last that long,\u201d said Doug Porter, chief economist for BMO Financial Group. \u201cBut if there\u2019s any surprise it\u2019s the strength of the Liberal minority. So while they\u2019ll have to listen to the NDP, the Liberals are much more in the drivers\u2019 seat than they were going into this.\u201d\n\nWhile the Liberals are free to court the support of any party, they are most likely to form an alliance with the NDP given broad similarities in policy priorities that include the carbon tax, restrictions on non-resident ownership in real estate, a desire to expand pharmacare and reduce cell phone bills.\n\nHowever, Porter expects the NDP to demand even more in exchange for its support. The party has made aggressive proposals for a wealth tax, national dental care program, elimination of subsidies to the oil sector and waiving interest on student loans.\n\nThat raises the prospect of even higher deficits from a Liberal government that has been in the red every year since taking power, Porter said. The Liberals\u2019 campaign promises alone are expected to push the existing deficit to $27 billion from $20 billion. The cost of a national pharmacare plan like the one the NDP has proposed could add another $10 billion to that tab, according to some estimates.\n\n\u201cThat is the net result of this election outcome, that we probably are looking at a somewhat looser fiscal policy and somewhat larger budget deficits than would otherwise be the case,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSpeaking as an economist, this is not the time to add stimulus to the economy when you have the lowest unemployment rate in 40 years. It actually makes more sense to let the economy do the work and bring the deficit down a bit, saving your resources for a time when the economy needs it. That said, Canada is in stronger fiscal shape than most other G7 economies.\u201d\n\nFor international investors and domestic companies, the strong Liberal showing means a less fragile political landscape in which to do business than was anticipated.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that uncertainty is the enemy of business we have a medium level over the next few years,\u201d said Dan Kelly, president and CEO of the Canadian Federation for Independent Business. \u201cThat\u2019s enough to allow business people plan without worrying about a massive amount of policy change in the days ahead.\u201d\n\nBut Kelly and others remain concerned about the lack of a plan to balance the budget and the absence of substantive discussion on long-term competitiveness and economic issues on the campaign trail.\n\nMeantime, the election exposed wide divisions in the country that will present a host of new challenges, said Perrin Beatty, president and chief executive of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe Conservatives dominated the vote in Saskatchewan and Alberta, taking all but one seat in the latter province amid simmering anger over the slow progress on the Trans Mountain Pipeline.\n\n\u201cThe first thing that members of parliament have to do is look at ways of bridging some of those gaps, the gaps between regions, between ideologies and sectors as well,\u201d Beatty said.\n\nThe oilpatch\u2019s mood turned sombre as the results rolled in from East to West Monday evening.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening and frustrating. It\u2019s hard for us to understand,\u201d said Whitecap Resources Inc. president and CEO Grant Fagerheim. \u201cHave we miscommunicated how important the energy sector is to the Canadian economy?\u201d Fagerheim said, shortly after the major networks projected a Liberal minority government, which he said was a negative outcome for the energy industry.\n\nHave we miscommunicated how important the energy sector is to the Canadian economy? Grant Fagerheim, president and CEO, Whitecap Resources\n\nFagerheim, whose company is headquartered in Alberta and operates in Saskatchewan, is concerned that a minority government would lead to more uncertainty for investors and for major energy infrastructure projects like the Trans Mountain pipeline.\n\nPotential Liberal coalition partners such as the NDP, the Bloc Quebecois and the Green Party have been vocally opposed to new pipelines and have demanded more stringent regulations on oil and gas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to understand why and how the rest of Canada doesn\u2019t understand the contribution of Alberta and Saskatchewan to the rest of the country\u2019s economy,\u201d said Fagerheim.\n\nWhile the Trans Mountain pipeline doesn\u2019t need another vote in the House of Commons to proceed \u201cany other pipeline faces a very high hurdle at this point,\u201d Porter of BMO said. \u201cJudging by the vote in Alberta and Saskatchewan, they won\u2019t be pleased by this to put it mildly.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: npowell@nationalpost.com | Twitter: Naomi_Powell\n\n\u2022 Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorgan", "description": "Country faces even higher deficits as Liberals forced to broker alliances with rival parties with expensive demands to retain power", "authors": ["Naomi Powell", "Geoffrey Morgan"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/liberal-minority.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
