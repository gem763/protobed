They deserve nurses. They deserve social workers. They deserve bilingual educators,\u201d special education teacher Linda Perales told CNN.\n\nSchool social worker Emily Penn said teachers face a continuing struggle to work in neighborhoods with socio-economic difficulties.\n\n\u201cOur students suffer from trauma. They suffer from so many things they need help coping with,\u201d Penn commented, adding that some students even face the threat of death \u201cby suicide and by guns. This is a fact in Chicago.\u201d\n\n75 percent of Chicago students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, and many depend on schools to provide meals. Chicago Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Janice Jackson said schools will remain open during the strike to provide \u201cbreakfast, lunch, and supper,\u201d but that school buses will not be running.\n\nWhile students are not required to attend school, administrators are encouraging families to send their children anyway. Administrative and non-union staff will be working.\n\nThe Chicago Board of Education had put forward a series of proposals on Friday to avoid a strike, without success.\n\n\u201cWe have tried to provide the best deal that\u2019s fiscally responsible \u2014 that\u2019s fair to teacher and fair to taxpayers,\u201d said Mayor Lori Lightfoot, calling the offer \u201cthe best in the Chicago Teachers Union\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nThe deal includes a $1 million investment toward reduced class sizes and a 16 percent pay raise for all school employees.", "description": "\"Our students deserve smaller class sizes.
