I enjoyed her giggly, larger-than-life personality and admired her shameless self-promotion.\n\n'Jennifer and I were friends for a few years, as she schmoozed her way around the London tech scene.'\n\nMr Yiannopoulos added: 'Throughout this period, Jennifer was bragging to me and others that she was having sex with Boris Johnson in her Shoreditch flat.\n\n'I warned her many times about getting physically involved with Boris, but it was already too late. Their affair was well underway.\n\n'Jennifer's sexual relationship with Boris won't be a surprise to anyone around during the heady days of the Tech City boom. It was an open secret - mostly because Jennifer loved to advertise it, especially after a few glasses of wine.\n\n'Jennifer's name-dropping of the then-Mayor of London could be exhausting. But it was also very entertaining.\n\n'One afternoon, Jennifer showed up to a Farringdon steak restaurant in a jaw-droppingly short skirt, with plum-coloured marks on her thighs and breasts that she proudly - and loudly - described as 'Boris bruises'.\n\n'She said they were the result of sex with Boris. There was no suggestion that anything abusive had occurred.\n\n'Rather, Jennifer flaunted the evidence of her affair, wearing them like trophies. They were the product of enthusiastic, consensual lovemaking, she said.'\n\nYesterday Jennifer Arcuri (pictured) repeatedly refused to deny a romance with Mr Johnson, who is facing a City Hall probe over alleged conflict of interest\n\nPrevious reports have claimed that Miss Arcuri confided in friends that she had a romance with Mr Johnson while she was his 'technology adviser'.\n\nPart of the row surrounds Miss Arcuri's application to become chief executive of the government quango Tech City in 2012.\n\nLeaked emails suggested that Mr Johnson had endorsed Miss Arcuri for the \u00a3100,000-a-year role.\n\nIn her interview yesterday Miss Arcuri said Mr Yiannopoulos, a friend of hers at the time, had backed her to apply for the job.\n\nHowever, Mr Yiannopoulos has now claimed that he only suggested she apply in order to 'mock' her.\n\n'Jennifer didn't realize at the time, but I was mocking her by recommending her for the Tech City post,' Mr Yiannopoulos said.\n\n'I didn't believe that Jennifer was being considered seriously, because I knew what a gossip and name-dropper she was and how indiscreet she had been about her affair with Boris.\n\n'But she showed me emails in which staff at the mayor's promotional agency London & Partners offered help with her application, even as she admitted to them she didn't have enough experience.\n\n'Jennifer frequently alluded to the professional advantage she might realise from her liaison.\n\nControversial activist Milo Yiannopoulos (left) claimed that Miss Arcuri (centre) had 'loudly and proudly' displayed evidence of a romance and said he had tried to warn her off it\n\nMilo Yiannopoulos said he knew American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri (pictured together) from the London tech scene\n\n'She even confided in me that Boris had written her a letter of recommendation for the Tech City position.\n\n'While the mayor was still married, Jennifer listed him on her CV as her primary professional reference. I know because she sent me the four-page document, asking me for help brushing it up.'\n\nHowever, Mr Yiannopoulos said he had 'no idea' whether Mr Johnson had 'lobbied for her behind the scenes'.\n\n'Over the years, I drifted from Jennifer as my work took me to America. I began to focus on politics and wrote less about tech,' he said.\n\n'She didn't make any effort to sustain the friendship. I guess she didn't perceive me as useful to her career when I acquired a reputation as a controversial and outspoken defender of Donald Trump.'\n\n'The Jennifer Arcuri I remember wanted, more than anything, simply to be famous. She was prepared to do anything to get there. Unfortunately for her, she succeeded. In 2014, Jennifer wrote to thank me for 'standing behind' her during her Tech City job application. 'You have my love forever because of this,' she added. I didn't have the heart to tell her it was all a cruel joke.'\n\nMiss Arcuri and her firms have been awarded more than \u00a3126,000 of taxpayers' money and the PM is facing claims of a conflict of interest.\n\nHer firm Innotech received a series of grants from Mr Johnson's promotional agency London and Partners.\n\nIn her Good Morning Britain interview yesterday, Miss Arcuri said she had never discussed any sponsorship or grants with Mr Johnson, and when asked if she had asked him to help with any 'sponsorship money', she said: 'Categorically no.'\n\nDuring the same interview, Miss Arcuri, speaking from California, repeatedly refused to answer whether she had had a romance with Mr Johnson.\n\nMiss Arcuri said she and Mr Johnson, who she saved on her phone as 'Alex the Great', bonded over their 'mutual love of classic literature'. Mr Johnson's first name is Alexander.\n\nMr Yiannopoulos (right) has claimed that he only suggested Jennifer Arcuri (left) apply for a tech executive role in order to 'mock' her\n\nMiss Arcuri repeatedly refused to answer questions about whether she had an affair with Mr Johnson, telling Piers: 'Would I ask you about your sex life?'\n\nThe businesswoman, who said she met Mr Johnson for the first time in October 2011, was asked if their friendship had developed into an intimate relationship.\n\nIt was 'really categorically no-one's business what private life we had, or didn't have,' she said in reply to presenter Piers Morgan.\n\nShe said 'it wasn't like he singled me out', adding: 'He is there to, you know, talk to anybody who gets in his face enough. And he was always a really good friend.\n\n'And I think it's quite unfortunate that it becomes that a good friend, who has now been, you know, now I'm dragged into the middle of this horrific scandal, you know, and the answer that I'm going to give is now going to be weaponised against this man.\n\n'It's really categorically no-one's business what private life we had, or didn't have. But - and categorically more important - Boris never, ever gave me favouritism. Never once did I ask him for a favour. Never once did he write a letter of recommendation for me. He didn't know about my asking to go to trips.'\n\nMiss Arcuri said Mr Johnson had visited her flat in Shoreditch - also where her office was based - a 'handful' of times.\n\n'We tried having drinks out in public or having lunch; it just became too much of a mob show, so I said 'You just have to come to my office',' she said.\n\nShe said the Prime Minister had been at her flat - which she confirmed had a pole-dancing pole - 'five, ten, a handful of times'.\n\nMiss Arcuri said she had been portrayed as an 'objectified ex-model pole dancer', referring to the pole in her flat.\n\nShe moved to California last year with British partner Matthew Hickey and their young daughter.\n\nMr Johnson insisted last week that everything he did when promoting London overseas as mayor was done in 'complete conformity with the code and the rules'.\n\nThe PM said yesterday that he had 'said all I want to say' about the matter. Number 10 declined to comment further. Messages to Miss Arcuri and her company were not answered last night.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Jennifer Arcuri's alleged fling with Mr Johnson when he was Mayor of London was an 'open secret', according to Milo Yiannopoulos.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/01/19420502-0-image-a-27_1570494807218.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
