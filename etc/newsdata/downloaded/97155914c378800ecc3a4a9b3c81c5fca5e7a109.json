He\u2019s just turned 21. So I think everyone, if anyone is getting too excited about this they should calm down because he\u2019s started five games for us.\n\n\u2018What he needs to do is work, work daily, work to show within the group that he deserves to play. As they all do, as all the players do. That\u2019s what the focus on everyone is.\u2019\n\nPulisic is understood to have cut short his summer holiday to make Chelsea\u2019s pre-season trip to Japan and be in shape for the campaign while club captain Cesar Azpilicueta last week backed the winger to succeed and said he was working hard in training.\n\n\u2018I have good players and everyone has a story,\u2019 added Lampard. \u2018Pulisic has a price tag, Ross Barkley is an international player, Mason Mount is an international player, Callum Hudson-Odoi just signed a new contract, Bayern Munich wanted to buy him last summer.\n\n'He\u2019s an international player. Ruben Loftus-cheek will come back and be an international player. I can\u2019t pick them all and be in the game unfortunately.\n\n'All I have to demand of them is that they show me in training and show me that they are worthy of the place.\u2019", "description": "The 21-year-old has been an unused substitute for the last three Premier League games before being omitted from the squad entirely for the Champions League win at Lille.", "authors": ["James Sharpe For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/20/19341160-0-image-a-51_1570304714193.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
