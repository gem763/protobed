Officials cautioned talks haven\u2019t finished yet and there\u2019s work still to do.\n\nThe pound surged after Bloomberg\u2019s initial reports, climbing as much as 1.5% to $1.28, the highest level in nearly five months.\n\nWhile there\u2019s some finalizing to do, there are clear indications that negotiators will present a legal text on Wednesday morning for EU governments to scrutinize, an official said. That would only be possible if there\u2019s a green light from Johnson, a separate official said.\n\nNegotiators have approached -- and even managed to strike -- a Brexit deal before, only to see it shot down by the British government or the House of Commons, and EU negotiators are aware of Johnson\u2019s need to get the DUP on board. This could complicate clinching a deal by Tuesday\u2019s midnight deadline and shift focus to a summit of EU leaders that starts in Brussels on Thursday.\n\nSaturday Vote\n\nIf a deal is reached, Johnson would be able to put it to the U.K. Parliament on Saturday and avoid being forced to seek another delay beyond Oct. 31. But he lacks a majority in Westminster and any concessions could prompt the DUP, which props up his administration, to try and thwart the agreement.\n\nThe U.K\u2019s proposals are shrouded in secrecy but the focus is on Northern Ireland\u2019s relationship to the EU\u2019s customs union and the degree to which checks can be eliminated on goods crossing the Irish border, a scene of violence for decades until the late 1990s.\n\nTwo EU officials suggested that the U.K. had accepted that customs checks would have to take place on goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland -- in other words between two parts of the U.K. -- rather than between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.\n\nThat customs border in the Irish Sea is something the DUP has previously said it won\u2019t support.\n\n(Updates with Parliament details starting in the sixth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Ian Wishart in Brussels at iwishart@bloomberg.net;Nikos Chrysoloras in Brussels at nchrysoloras@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net, Richard Bravo, Thomas Penny\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- U.K. and European Union negotiators in Brussels are closing in on a draft Brexit deal with optimism there will be a breakthrough before the end of the day Tuesday, two EU officials said.Any draft legal text will hinge on whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson believes he has the support", "authors": ["Ian Wishart", "Nikos Chrysoloras"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
