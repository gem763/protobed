The meetings will conclude on Friday. The prime minister is tasked with looking for an alternative parliamentary majority after Matteo Salvini's League decided to pull the plug on the previous government earlier this month.\n\nThe populist 5Star Movement, the League's former coalition partner, and the center-left Democratic Party told Mattarella on Wednesday that they would like to form an alliance. However, they don't have a majority in the Senate so they will need the backing of other parties.\n\nFree and Equal (Liberi e Uguali), a far-left group, and some non-affiliated lawmakers are expected to join forces with the new alliance.\n\nDuring his acceptance speech on Thursday, Conte said this is a \"very delicate moment because of the global economic slowdown and the looming budget deadline.\" He said he is determined to create a team to \"tackle environmental issues and social inequalities [and] to focus on infrastructure, networks and international relations.\"\n\n\"This won't be a government against someone but for something,\" he said.\n\nWhether Conte can succeed remains still to be seen. The PD and the 5Stars are still arguing over top government posts and 5Stars leader Luigi Di Maio's future role. The 5Stars also confirmed that its activists will have the final say on the new alliance and they are preparing to call a binding vote using its private online platform. One senior 5Stars official said \"if activists vote against the alliance it's a huge problem,\" suggesting 5Star lawmakers might be forced to vote against Conte's new government in parliament.\n\nMeanwhile, outgoing Interior Minister Salvini announced a rally against the planned new government in Rome on October 19. \"We have to take to the streets to protest against this theft of democracy,\" he said in a Facebook live chat on Thursday afternoon.", "description": "Matteo Salvini\u2019s League will end up in opposition if the 5Stars/Democratic Party alliance succeeds.", "authors": ["Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1036083118-1200x628.jpg"}
