The second one would include a second specific date when Britain could leave.\n\nJohnson won the leadership of the ruling Conservative Party to become prime minister in a minority government by staking his career on getting Brexit done by Oct. 31, but after parliament rejected his proposed legislative timetable on Tuesday he will fail to do that.\n\nBrexit was initially supposed to have taken place on March 29 but Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, was forced to delay twice as parliament defeated her Brexit deal by margins of between 58 and 230 votes earlier this year. Her failure cost May her job.\n\nBREXIT PARALYSIS\n\nJohnson said in a letter to opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Thursday he would give parliament more time to approve his Brexit deal by Nov. 6 but lawmakers must on Monday back a December election, Johnson's third attempt to try to force a snap vote.\n\n\"Prolonging this paralysis into 2020 would have dangerous consequences,\" he said. \"If I win a majority in this election, we will then ratify the great new deal that I have negotiated, get Brexit done in January and the country will move on.\"\n\nCorbyn said he would wait to see what the EU decides on a Brexit delay before deciding which way to vote on Monday, repeating that he could only back an election when the risk of Johnson taking Britain out of the EU without a deal to smooth the transition was off the table.\n\nIt is not clear how Corbyn would respond if the EU makes no decision on a date on Friday.", "description": "EU likely to shelve Brexit delay as Britain squabbles over election", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9O0D8_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
