At all levels of sport, they\u2019re stepping onto the podium and into the headlines. New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard won two gold medals at the Pacific Games, and college senior CeC\u00e9 Telfer became the NCAA Division II national champion in the 400-meter run. Another senior, June Eastwood, has been instrumental to her cross-country team\u2019s success. At the high school level, Terry Miller won the girls\u2019 200-meter dash at Connecticut\u2019s state open championship track meet.\n\nThese recent performances are inherently praiseworthy\u2014shining examples of what humans can accomplish with training and effort. But as more transgender athletes rise to the top of their fields, some vocal opponents are also expressing outrage at what they see as transgender athletes ruining sports for cisgendered girls and women.\n\nThese issues have come to a head in Connecticut, where a conservative Christian group called Alliance Defending Freedom has filed a legal complaint on behalf of three high school athletes who are seeking to bar transgender girls from competing in the girls category. In Connecticut, as in more than a dozen other states, high school athletes are allowed to compete in the category that matches their gender identity. According to ADF legal counsel Christiana Holcomb, two transgender athletes\u2014Miller and another runner, Andraya Yearwood\u2014\u201chave amassed 15 different state championship titles that were once held by nine different girls across the state.\u201d The US Department of Education\u2019s office for civil rights is now investigating the group\u2019s complaint.\n\nNowhere are the debates around transgender rights as stark as they are in sports, where the temptation to draw a hard biological line has run up against the limits of what science can offer. The outcome, at least so far, is an inconsistent mix of rules that leaves almost nothing resolved.\n\nIn the NCAA, for example, transgender women can compete on women\u2019s teams after they\u2019ve completed one year of testosterone suppression treatment. But the organization doesn\u2019t place limits on what a transgender athlete\u2019s testosterone levels can be. The International Olympic Committee has more granular rules: Transgender women can compete in the women\u2019s category as long as their blood testosterone levels have been maintained below 10 nano moles per liter for a minimum of 12 months. Cisgender men typically have testosterone levels of 7.7 to 29.4 nano moles per liter, while premenopausal cis women are generally 1.7 nmol/L or less. Meanwhile, the governing body of track and field just adopted a 5nmol/L limit.\n\nSo which approach is most fair? \u201cFair is a very subjective word,\u201d says Joanna Harper, a transgender woman, distance runner, and researcher who served on the IOC committee that developed that organization\u2019s current rules. It boils down to whom you\u2019re trying to be fair to, Harper says. \u201cTo billions of typical women who cannot compete with men at high levels of sport?\u201d Or \u201ca very repressed minority in transgender people who only want to enjoy the same things that everybody else does, including participation in sports?\u201d\n\nTransgender women\u2019s performances generally decline as their testosterone does. But not every male advantage dissipates when testosterone drops. Some advantages, such as their bigger bone structure, greater lung capacity, and larger heart size remain, says Alison Heather, a physiologist at the University of Otago in New Zealand. Testosterone also promotes muscle memory\u2014an ability to regain muscle mass after a period of detraining\u2014by increasing the number of nuclei in muscles, and these added nuclei don\u2019t go away. So transgender women have a heightened ability to build strength even after they transition, Heather says.", "description": "Transgender athletes at all levels of sport are winning medals, spurring a contentious debate over the future of gendered competition.", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Christie Aschwande", "Lauren Goode", "Gregory Barber", "Matt Simon", "Andy Greenberg", "Jennifer Ouellette", "Ars Technica", "Alex Baker-Whitcomb", "Adam Rogers"], "top_image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/5daf5f4741c1680009813b2c/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Science_Laurel-Hubbard-943605096.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
