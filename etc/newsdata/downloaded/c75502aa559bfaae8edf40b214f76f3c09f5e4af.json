The poofy '80s prom sleeve is back in a big way (as if these sleeves could do anything subtly), and I don\u2019t know how to feel about it.\n\nWell, actually I do know, but I\u2019d hate to offend anyone\u2019s artistry or taste. But, here goes nothing: I\u2019m not on board with the sleeves. But I\u2019ve never been an early adopter of anything. Perhaps they\u2019ll grow on me, but as of now, looking at the big sleeves gives me a pit in my stomach.\n\nUnlike stars on the Emmys red carpet, I\u2019m not ready to embrace the trend with open arms. (\u201cCould she even lift her arms in those sleeves?\u201d any spin instructor who has led me through the arms portion of class contemplates.)\n\nWorst dressed at the Emmys: Kendall Jenner, Gwyneth Paltrow, Karamo Brown top the list\n\nActresses Susan Kelechi Watson, Zoe Kazan and Emerald Fennell at the Emmy Awards on Sept. 22, 2019.

Meanwhile, I\u2019m just happy there were no reports of anyone bumping into each other like untethered Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade balloons, as it would\u2019ve taken Gwyneth Paltrow, a victim of her restrictive vintage Valentino gown, forever to get out of harm\u2019s way.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the red carpet. Puffed sleeves popped up at Tory Burch\u2019s presentation for New York Fashion Week on Sept. 8, for which the '80s served as inspiration, in part. During Paris Fashion Week, which kicked off Sept. 23, Isabel Marant and Christian Siriano also showed designs in line with the big sleeve trend.\n\nParis Fashion Week, Spring/Summer 2020: The most over-the-top and outrageous looks\n\nSo, if we can\u2019t escape them \u2013 literally, because the giant sleeves are closing in on us \u2013 and saying \u201cpoof be gone\u201d hasn\u2019t seemed to work, how can we keep sleeve anxiety at CBD-treated levels? Celebrity stylists Nicole Chavez and Erin Walsh have some advice.\n\nWhat's good about the puff sleeve trend\n\nBoth stylists say the emphasis on the shoulder helps create the illusion of a smaller center, which is a win, right?\n\nChavez, who dressesKristen Bell, Jessica Simpson and Rachel Bilson, says \"that broad shoulder, that puff sleeve, it really does give a very feminine form. So it\u2019s gonna make anybody\u2019s waist look much smaller.\"\n\nWalsh, a stylist to celebs such as Sarah Jessica Parker, Alison Brie and Beanie Feldstein, says she feels pulled by the puffed and large shoulders. \"It\u2019s just kind of flattering on most women. It makes you look more proportional and thinner.\"\n\nShe adds, \"volume in the arms kind of helps the rest of the story out, I think it\u2019s a good hack in fact.\"\n\nCelebrity stylists Nicole Chavez, left, and Erin Walsh (Photo: Courtesy of Nicole Chavez and courtesy of Erin Walsh)\n\nHow to modernize puffy sleeves\n\nBut how do you make sure you don't appear to have escaped an 80s prom photo? The stylists say the way you complement your look should be a nod to the present.\n\nChavez says she'd be sure the makeup and hair was \"really contemporary or very pared down,\" and did not have a hint of an \"'80s vibe,\" meaning \"no colored eye shadows.\"\n\nShe adds that people should think this way when assessing their look head to toe, opting for footwear that \"doesn\u2019t feel like an '80s shoe.\"\n\nAnd put those crimpers down! \"If you\u2019re wearing an '80s dress \u2013 '80s to me was big hair, perms, big bangs \u2013 I would do something very sleek,\" Chavez says, \"So either a slicked back bun or sleek, pin-straight, parted-down-the middle hair.\"\n\nSimilarly, Walsh advises to \"shake it up with more modern accents that don\u2019t feel quite so literal to that reference,\" recommending \"clean crisp accents in terms of accessories and less is more probably works to balance it out.\"\n\nModels present creations during Paris Fashion Week at shows for (from left to right) Isabel Marant, Christian Siriano and L'Oreal.

You want to look like your best self in this world, so you should adjust your clothing accordingly.\"\n\nJennifer Lopez stuns on Milan Fashion Week runway in new version of iconic Versace dress\n\nC\u00e9line Dion hits back at body-shamers who say she's too thin: \u2018You can\u2019t please everybody\u2019\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/fashion/2019/10/02/celebrity-stylists-explain-puff-sleeve-fashion-trend-how-to-wear/2432061001/", "description": "We\u2019re really doing this?
