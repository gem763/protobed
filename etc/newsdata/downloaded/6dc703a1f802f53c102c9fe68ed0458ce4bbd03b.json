U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for even more rate cuts, pointing to falling interest rates at other central banks around the world.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve is derelict in its duties if it doesn\u2019t lower the Rate and even, ideally, stimulate. Take a look around the World at our competitors. Germany and others are actually GETTING PAID to borrow money. Fed was way too fast to raise, and way too slow to cut!\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nThe pair was unchanged at 1.1102 after the European Central Bank (ECB) left monetary policy unchanged on Thursday.\n\nOutgoing ECB President Mario Draghi rejected criticism of his negative interest rate policy and his insistence on resuming outright purchases of government bonds from next month.\n\n\u201cThe improvements in the economy have more than offset the negative side effects\u201d on the financial system, Draghi said at his regular press conference.\n\nHe added that he wasn\u2019t unduly concerned about the dissent regarding September\u2019s multi-faceted package of easing measures, saying that all the key economic data from the euro zone in the course of the last month had justified the actions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken this as part and parcel of the ongoing debate and discussions,\u201d Draghi said.\n\nThe pair traded 0.04% higher at 108.64.", "description": "Forex - Pound Slips as Johnson Calls for Election; Dollar Moves Higher on PMI Data", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED4S0CO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
