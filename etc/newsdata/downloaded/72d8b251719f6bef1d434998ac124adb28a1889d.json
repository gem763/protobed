Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbyn called for party members to abstain from the vote to show opposition to Johnson\u2019s leadership.\n\nThe prime minister said he will take a different strategy on the fourth attempt \u2014 and present a short bill to Parliament that needs only a simple majority to pass.\n\nJohnson\u2019s effort, however, might finally succeed this time. Corbyn said Tuesday he supports an election next month and called on party lawmakers to vote for it. He pledged \u201cthe biggest campaign this party has ever mounted.\u201d\n\nLiberal Democrats Party leader Jo Swinson said Johnson\u2019s call failed because he\u2019s lost lawmakers\u2019 trust. Part of the opposition has to do with the date of the vote.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson claims he wants a general election, but he also claimed he wouldn\u2019t [suspend] Parliament or put a border down the Irish sea,\u201d Swinson said. \u201cIf Boris Johnson wants a General Election, then he could have supported our bill for a General Election on Dec. 9. Instead, he has chosen to stick to his original plan for Dec. 12, which we have already rejected.\u201d\n\nSince taking office in July, Johnson has promised to complete the EU withdrawal one way or another. He was forced by lawmakers last month to seek another extension when his proposed agreement failed to find sufficient support in Parliament.\n\n\u201cI will not allow this paralysis to continue and, one way or another, we must proceed straight to an election,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cThis House cannot any longer keep this country hostage.\n\n\u201cMillions of families and businesses cannot plan for the future and I don\u2019t believe this paralysis and this stagnation should be allowed to continue.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 29 (UPI) \u2014 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Tuesday despite three failed attempts to schedule early elections in December, he will try", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
