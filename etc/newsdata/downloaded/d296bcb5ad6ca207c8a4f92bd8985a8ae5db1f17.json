Although it is not yet clear how the group will respond to al-Baghdadi\u2019s death, experts said they expected the group to continue on with new leadership, a sentiment shared by those who experienced life under the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that Daesh ends by killing this person who destroyed our revolution, killed my brother and displaced us,\u201c said Yasmin Mashaan, a refugee in Germany from Deir el-Zour, an Islamic State stronghold on the Euphrates, using another name for the group.\n\n\u201cI am happy when every tyrant receives such a fate, whether it is Baghdadi who killed my brother, or Bashar al-Assad, who killed my other four brothers,\u201d she said, referring to the Syrian leader.\n\nThe violence and upheaval in Syria has many authors. But the Islamic State group brought a unique form of daily terror to the territory that it sought to transform into its brutal, medieval vision of God\u2019s rule on earth.\n\nAlthough the militants brought a level of administrative order to the areas it ruled at first, its violent subjugation of the civilians living there, coupled with the battles that consumed its territory as the U.S.-led coalition tried to destroy the group, made it all but impossible for civilians to survive the Islamic State\u2019s rule intact.\n\nReligious morality police patrolled the streets, beating women for not covering their faces fully, detaining and flogging men for not growing their beards long enough and beheading people for offenses as small as smoking. Mass graves discovered since the fall of the so-called caliphate bluntly testify to the mass executions that took place there.\n\nCivilians lived under constant threat of airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition. Escape routes were seeded with Islamic State snipers and land mines.\n\nFor Hussam Hammoud, 27, an activist from Raqqa, the onetime capital of the Islamic State, al-Baghdadi\u2019s death was a reminder of the suffering experienced by those who were forced to live under his uncompromising and extremist movement.\n\n\u201cThe victims of this organization are all over the place,\u201d said Hammoud, who said that he fled to Turkey because the Syrian army, which was his original enemy, was now advancing toward him. \u201cWe are happy that he was killed, but we do not think our misery will end because of that.\u201d\n\nWith Russia, Turkey, the Syrian government, U.S. troops and Kurdish fighters all jostling for position in northeastern Syria, the onetime heart of the so-called caliphate, in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from the area, many Syrians are still suffering from the violence there.", "description": "BAGHDAD -- In the Islamic State strongholds in Syria and Iraq where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his allies lived, there was bitterness at the news that the head of the Islamic State group had died -- not that it had happened, but that it had not happened sooner.Al-Baghdadi, who was killed in a nighttime", "authors": ["Alissa J.
