The latest activity triggered a months-long stand-off between the two countries.\n\nThe departure of the Haiyang Dizhi 8 came amid reports that the Japanese oil rig, Hakuryu 5, owned by Tokyo-based Japan Drilling Company and employed by Rosneft, had earlier this week completed a drilling mission it started in May near Vanguard Bank.\n\nChina\u2019s Defence Minister Wei Fenghe told a regional security conference that the South China Sea was an inalienable part of China\u2019s territory.

China uses the U-shaped line to claim sovereignty over more than 80 per cent of the resource-rich waterway, parts of which are also claimed by Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.\n\nIan Storey, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said that the withdrawal of the Haiyang Dizhi might only be \u201ctemporary\u201d.\n\n\u201cChina has made its point about drilling activities within the nine-dash line and expects Vietnam to suspend further exploration and production activities,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] of course Vietnam won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nZhang Mingliang, a specialist in Southeast Asian affairs at Jinan University in the south China city of Guangzhou, said that the Chinese ship\u2019s withdrawal was unlikely to have had anything to do with the comments made by Vietnam.\n\n\u201cI think the main reason is that it had finished its work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the withdrawal could also be seen as an attempt to ease the [China\u2019s] tensions with the US.\u201d", "description": "The Chinese survey ship that has been at the centre of a stand-off with Vietnam in the South China Sea was back in waters close to home on Friday afternoon, according to an online platform that provides information about maritime activity.As of 4pm, the Haiyang Dizhi 8 (Marine Geology 8), which had been", "authors": ["Laura Zhou"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eX2UwrIMTmKKKPNR6PHCTw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_621/13548b7e99a9583f118d87362162a69b", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
