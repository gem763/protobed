Don't use Juul.\n\n\"Don't start using nicotine if you don't have a pre-existing relationship with nicotine,\" the chief added. \"Don't use the product. You're not our target consumer.\"\n\nDespite the increased prevalence of e-cigarettes in recent years, little is known about the long-term effects of regular vaping.\n\nBurns acknowledged this fact when it was raised by Dokoupil during their interview, stating: \"That's true, that's a true statement.\"\n\nNonetheless, the CEO remained adamant in his belief that the Juul e-cigarette \"does not present a risk\" to consumers.\n\nE-cigarette and vapour companies in the US, including Juul, are required to submit pre-market tobacco applications to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by 12 May 2020 for approval.\n\nIf Juul's application is not approved by the FDA, the company will no longer be allowed to sell its product.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
