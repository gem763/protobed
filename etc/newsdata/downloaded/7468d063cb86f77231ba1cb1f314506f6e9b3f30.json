It\u2019s operatives, he was forced to admit, brutally murdered and dismembered the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nHas she ever pointed out to him the down home Mean Girls wisdom?\u2014\u201cThere are two kinds of evil people in this world. Those who do evil stuff and those who see evil stuff being done and don\u2019t try to stop it.\"\n\nWell, now, we have the answer, sort of.\n\nAccording to Lindsay\u2019s father, World\u2019s Greatest Dad finalist Michael Lohan, who has made a decent living out of exploiting his daughter\u2019s fame when not in jail, Lindsay and MBS, share a \u201cplatonic and respectful\u201d friendship.\n\nSpeaking to Page Six at Denise Rich\u2019s Angel Ball on Monday, Lohan said: \u201cThey are just friends, Lindsay has a lot of powerful friends in the Middle East, because she is huge out there. Lindsay met MBS because of the work she has been doing in the Middle East. She is working to help people in the region, particularly refugees.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cNobody writes about the good work Lindsay does in Syria, they just want to hear the bad stuff. She has a platonic and respectful relationship with MBS, nothing more.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by Page Six\u2019s astute reporter if he was perhaps concerned that Lindsay is spending time with someone accused of imprisoning members of his own family and ordering the murder of Khashoggi, Lohan said, \u201cNone of that has proven to be true,\u201d even though, you know, it has.\n\nLohan has spent much of her time in Dubai in recent years where she still has a huge following. In 2017 she met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan as part of a campaign to highlight the plight of Syrian refugees and was photographed visiting a refugee camp.", "description": "The actress\u2019 father says his daughter has a \u201cplatonic and respectful\u201d friendship with the unpredictable Saudi royal.", "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_383,w_682,x_0,y_71/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572427577/GettyImages-631361656_oyk7yj", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
