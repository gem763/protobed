After all, their deployment is unprecedented, and their consequences are largely unknown.\n\nSo far, negative rates have mostly been sequestered to Europe and Japan \u2014 and the consensus view on Wall Street and at the Federal Reserve is that they won't be creeping onto US soil anytime soon.\n\nBut not all are quick to dismiss negative-yielding-debt presence in the US. And one former hedge-fund manager thinks negative rates' implementation is nothing short of inevitable.\n\nThat man is Raoul Pal, the founder of Real Vision.\n\nTo bring you up to speed, Pal retired at age 36 after quitting jobs at both Goldman Sachs and GLG Partners. He lives comfortably on a 140-person island in the Cayman Islands and spends his days writing market research, which comes with a hefty price tag of $40,000 per year.\n\nPal thinks the US economy is on a one-way track to negative interest rates \u2014 an idea that was perceived unfathomable just a few years ago.\n\n\"US yields are too high,\" he said on \"The Sherman Show,\" a podcast hosted by Jeffrey Sherman, DoubleLine Capital's deputy chief investment officer. \"They need to go to zero at least \u2014 and I think negative \u2014 for the world to start to basically be able to readjust to this ridiculous dollar.\"\n\nRead more: BlackRock's bond chief oversees $1.7 trillion and sleeps only 4 hours a night. He outlines his 2 favorite opportunities in a market being reshaped by tech and shifting demographics.\n\nPal's thesis behind the call is straightforward.\n\nUS Treasurys are one of the only places investors can capture a real risk-free return. And as a result, demand for them has been insatiable. Those Treasurys are priced in dollars, so high demand for Treasurys translates to high demand for the dollar.\n\nIt has created a cycle that's feeding on itself. And, according to Pal, it's creating formidable problems for the rest of the world.\n\nPal has the US President in his corner as well. President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his distaste for a strong dollar, tweeting recently: \"As your President, one would think that I would be thrilled with our very strong dollar. I am not!\"\n\nBut that's not all. He's quick to warn of the unintended consequences that come hand in hand with negative rates. Specifically, the immense amount of pressure below-zero yields have on banks and pension funds.\n\n\"You can see that in Japan, and you can see it in Europe \u2014 the banking system cannot deal with negative rates,\" he said.\n\nFor context, over the past five years, the iShares MSCI Europe Financials ETF (EUFN) \u2014 a proxy for bank health in the eurozone \u2014 has lost over 17% of its value. Proof that confidence is waning and the sector is deteriorating.\n\nRead more: The man responsible for the finances of NYC's richest millennials details the road to mastering and growing your wealth in 3 simple steps\n\nStill, this isn't the biggest of his concerns.\n\n\"The really big problem \u2014 the dirty secret \u2014 is no pension is going to meet its liabilities,\" he said. \"It is impossible to meet your liabilities with negative yields.\"\n\nHe continued: \"The fixed income that needs to be paid out to retirees is basically impossible.\"\n\nPension funds rely on fixed-income investments to deliver steady streams of capital to their recipients. However, in a negative-interest-rate environment, this is no longer an option. A reliable flow of capital falls by the wayside. As a result, pensions are forced to take increased risk to meet their bare-minimum requirements.\n\nThat's a problem \u2014 and Pal thinks its effects could be disastrous.\n\n\"If we're not careful, most of these pension systems will go into the next recession with far too much risk in corporate credit and equity, and not enough government-bond risk,\" he said. \"Therefore, they're going to end up with big black holes from the losses that usually come in a recession, but just as people retire.\"\n\nHe concluded: \"My guess is that the government are going to have to underwrite the pension system at some point.\"", "description": "Pal, the former hedge-fund manager who founded Real Vision, thinks negative rates in the US are inevitable \u2014 and that they need to happen soon.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da738becc4a0a5f263fd244?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
