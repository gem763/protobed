So when they [members of the legislature] get back to work, they're going to have this demand up front, in front of them.\n\n\"Most of the members that are inside here [Parliament], they come from a hectic political background where they started their careers on the streets like this, and now young people are shouting for a different kind of change. They're saying, 'save the world'. Our call back in the day was 'save South Africa', now they're saying, 'no, it's now time to save the world'.\"\n\nA 13-year-old named Grace said \"the older generation will die of old age and we're going to die of climate change if we don't do something. They're leaving us to fix their mistakes. We need to leave coal in the ground\".\n\nSchoolchildren protest to draw attention to climate change.

I'm trying to stop that.\"\n\nHe suggested government \"switch from coal power to wind, hydro and solar power and more natural resources\", before adding that parents and adults in general needed to listen to their kids \"and not just listen, like actually hear. The planet is really dying\".\n\nDee Janisch, a teacher who accompanied the pupils, said: \"A bunch of the students are part of a module called 'future now', where we look at sustainability using the 17 United Nations goals as a lens to frame our education course.\"\n\n\"Parents and school[s] are aware, all have given permission, all support it and back it.\"\n\nThe climate strike, or Fridays for Future, global movement was started in 2018 by sixteen-year-old Swedish pupil Greta Thunberg, in which students around the world walk out of their classrooms to demand climate action.\n\nThunberg and others have argued that they will still be young in 2030, the year in which a report by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns the climate crisis will be irreversible unless world leaders take immediate action to stop carbon emissions which are rapidly warming the planet.", "description": "It may be exam season, but dozens of school pupils have taken to the streets outside of Parliament in Cape Town to join in a global protest to demand action on climate change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8913/1f5f990fbf7c45d4be66ea07d1711500.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-05-24"}
