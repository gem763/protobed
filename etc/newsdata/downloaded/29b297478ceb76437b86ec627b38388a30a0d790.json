We\u2019ve written the book on how to lose sportingly, but there\u2019s not been a chapter yet on losing by default to a typhoon.\u201d\n\nMoore, who is hoping still to get to the match with his son, questioned the fairness of drawing certain fixtures that can\u2019t be played and what effect that will have on the overall integrity of the competition, saying: \u201cIt is a long tournament, and you would have thought there would be enough flexibility to delay until the weather improved.\u201d\n\nScottish Rugby has said that it fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarter-finals on the pitch, but online fans have vented their frustration at what they see as a lack of planning.\n\nThose watching from Scotland are also debating the different outcomes of cancellation versus playing. Craig Shearer, a Murrayfield season ticket holder from Dundee, explained: \u201cWe\u2019re all being pragmatic here. I think the organisers have good procedures in place. Decisions are being taken in good time so fans are in no doubt as to what\u2019s happening. When it comes down to it, this is about public safety and these guys are the experts.\u201d\n\nBut Shearer went on to raise a point that is being made by many: \u201cThe decision of World Rugby to give the World Cup to Japan in typhoon season is one to consider. The development of the Japanese (and tier two in general) is a big thing and this decision was taken as a very positive move. The risks of this happening must have been assessed.\u201d Other fans also queried why World Rugby agreed to the rule that cancellation would be marked as a draw when it was likely to cause controversy.\n\nScotland happy to play behind closed doors if necessary, says Townsend Read more\n\nMeanwhile, the Scottish Rugby Union is advising supporters who are already in Japan to heed the advice of the Foreign Office, which is \u201cto follow all official advice, stay indoors and do not attempt to travel on Saturday\u201d. There is an official warning for a continuous risk of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis across the country, which may well also affect the qualifying for the F1 Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, which is also due to take place on Saturday.\n\nCammy Black, the deputy editor of the Scottish Rugby Blog, said that the fans he is in touch with are keeping the drama in perspective. \u201cMost fans have huge sympathy for Japan, it\u2019s a massive tournament for them and they have really embraced the Scottish team. If it is cancelled it will be hugely disappointing for the players having worked up to this for four years, and the fans who have paid money to go out there. But we need to be level-headed when there\u2019s a huge storm coming that\u2019s going to affect lots of people\u2019s lives and this is a game of rugby.\u201d", "description": "Scotland fans hope game against Japan can go ahead but anger and frustration at prospect of exit is giving way to pragmatism", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/346590d7a4de066751ff2ac9418b4a30f47a6961/0_292_5328_3197/master/5328.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a0ecb2a426fcdca9fa4febae1e59312f", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
