Their plight shows how farmers in Europe, one of the world\u2019s leading producers and exporters, are on the front line of global warming.\n\nRising temperatures in Italy have created a plague of crop-eating bugs, causing hundreds of millions of euros in losses.\n\nThe Swiss government has recently said that last year\u2019s record temperatures, followed up by more heat waves this year, bring \u201cgrave consequences\u201d for agriculture.\n\nAnd in Finland, a major producer of spring barley and oats, soil fertility is declining as more frequent wet and dry spells strip the earth of nutrients, according to a recent European Environment Agency report.\n\n\u201cNew records are being set around the world due to climate change, and the adverse effects are already affecting agricultural production in Europe, especially in the south,\u201d said Hans Bruyninckx, the agency\u2019s executive director.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Ms Merkel\u2019s administration has set aside more than \u20ac500m (\u00a3443m) in aid, while in France, agriculture minister Didier Guillaume presented a package for farmers worth \u20ac1bn (\u00a3860m) in July.\n\nThe European Union does have plentiful grain supplies \u2013 at least for the time being. This season\u2019s soft-wheat harvest in France, the bloc\u2019s top producer, was among the largest on record, alongside bumper barley supplies. That is helping to boost global wheat reserves to an all-time high this season, the USDA forecasts.\n\nWarmer temperatures have aided crops in some regions, with the winter-wheat area in Russia - the top shipper - expanding due to improved seed quality and mild weather. Climate change may benefit wheat and corn yields in eastern Europe, according to a European Commission paper.\n\nRising temperatures are impacting agriculture around the world, not just in Europe. The best growing conditions for many crops are shifting away from the tropics, and from lower lying land, to cooler climes. Fish and other underwater catches, too, are migrating to colder seas as their habitats warm.\n\nEurope is particularly exposed because its weather is dominated by the jet stream. Disturbances to the narrow bands of air that blow west to east across the Atlantic have allowed hot blasts to drift in from the Sahara desert, further damaging crops that evolved to cope with milder conditions.\n\nIn Italy, the rising temperatures have unleashed a swarm of Brown marmorated stink bugs, a pest that feeds on grain crops and orchard fruits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency,\u201d said Nicola Dalmonte, owner of a 50-hectare fruit farm on the outskirts of Ravenna, who this year lost around 30 per cent of his crops to the bugs. He has covered his peach and apricot plants in nets, but said that has sometimes made things worse when the insects get trapped inside. \u201cThey breed explosively.\u201d\n\nCeline Imart, a farmer near Toulouse, France, said in recent years there have been many unusual weather events affecting the land her family has cultivated for six generations, producing crops like sunflowers, peas, sorghum, soybeans and corn.\n\nHailstorms are becoming more intense and damaged as much as 50 per cent of this season\u2019s crops.\n\nBack in Germany, Mr Schwienhorst hopes his case will help raise awareness of climate change. He wants the court to force the government to come up with a plan to hit its lapsed 2020 climate goals as soon as possible. He argues failure to honour the pledges has infringed property, occupational and health rights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I blame Ms Merkel,\u201d Mr Schwienhorst said. \u201cThis is a problem caused by our whole society.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "After three straight years of crop losses due to soaring temperatures and crippling droughts, Heiner Luetke Schwienhorst has had enough and is taking Europe\u2019s most powerful government to court.", "authors": ["William Wilkes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/28/14/istock-1037693392.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
