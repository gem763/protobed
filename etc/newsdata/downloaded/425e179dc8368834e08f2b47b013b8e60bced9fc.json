How about it? Do your clients know that?\u201d\n\nThe speech, which has been fully translated into English by U.S. blog The American Conservative, is a lengthy polemic on mass migration and Islamisation. In it, Zemmour calls the present migratory flows to Europe a reverse colonisation and said the process was a \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d, because in his opinion the difficulties of mass migration are compounded by a resurgent Islam.\n\nInvestigation Launched into French Philosopher over Islam Speech https://t.co/I12UHn61wz \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 3, 2019\n\nThe SOS Racisme group, who are a collection of various NGOs, have put pressure on those critical of Islamisation and demographic changes in the past.\n\nIn 2017, they were behind a court case against B\u00e9ziers Mayor Robert M\u00e9nard after he wrote on Twitter, \u201cIn a class in the city centre of my town, 91 per cent of the children are Muslims. Obviously, this is a problem. There are limits to tolerance.\u201d\n\nSOS Racisme has also been the recipient of cash from billionaire pluotocrat George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation, which has funded other far-left groups such as Hope not Hate in Britain and the Expo Foundation in Sweden.\n\nEarlier last week, the Paris Prosecutor\u2019s Office announced they would be launching an investigation into Mr Zemmour following his speech made at the \u201cConvention of the Right\u201d last weekend.\n\nMarion Marechal Calls for French to Resist \u2018Great Replacement\u2019 https://t.co/e5lwcWlJup \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 1, 2019", "description": "Far-left French activist group SOS Racisme has begun targetting advertisers of French newspaper Le Figaro after it's employee, philosopher Eric Zemmour's controversial Islam and immigration speech.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-461490604-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
