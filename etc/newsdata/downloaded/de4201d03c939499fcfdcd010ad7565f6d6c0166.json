One official said: \u201cAll we care about is: does it work? Does it allow for all the checks and controls necessary to protect the single market and customs union.\u201d\n\nHow can Northern Ireland be part of the UK customs area without creating a border in Ireland?\n\nOfficials close to the negotiations say that while Mr Johnson is reviving Mrs May\u2019s proposed customs partnership from last year he is scaling it back so it applies only to Northern Ireland. British officials are still working on the details.\n\nUnder the plan, Northern Ireland would remain legally part of the UK customs area but in practice would be part of the EU\u2019s customs territory.\n\nGoods entering Northern Ireland would pass a customs border in the Irish Sea, where EU tariffs would be levied and passed to Brussels.\n\nIn the event that the UK had lower tariffs than the EU, as a result of trade deals struck by Britain with third countries, importers would have to apply for a rebate if they sold their goods in Northern Ireland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem with this plan?\n\nMrs May originally proposed this model \u2014 where the UK collects tariffs on the EU\u2019s behalf \u2014 for goods entering any British port, including on the mainland as part of a long-term trading arrangement with Europe.\n\nMichel Barnier said that the UK prime minister made the key concession that there cannot be \u201cborder across the island of Ireland\u201d. AP\n\nMr Johnson said at the time it was \u201ccrazy\u201d and Jacob Rees-Mogg, now Leader of the House of Commons, said: \u201cIt\u2019s completely cretinous.\u201d Mr Johnson\u2019s plan applies the same principle, but is simpler as it would only apply to Northern Ireland.\n\nBut it is more difficult for the Democratic Unionist party to swallow because it creates a new customs border in the Irish Sea with UK officials collecting tariffs for Brussels. It would mean paperwork for businesses in the region.\n\nJon Thompson, head of HMRC, said the scheme \u2014 had it applied to goods entering all UK ports \u2014 would have taken about five years to set up.\n\nAre there any legal problems?\n\nThe plan would face legal problems in the UK, thanks to the efforts of hardline Tory Eurosceptics, including some now serving in the cabinet, to stop Northern Ireland being carved off into a separate customs territory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne amendment to the 2018 Customs act would make it unlawful for Northern Ireland to be part of a separate customs territory to Great Britain. Mr Johnson might argue that under his plan, the region remains legally part of the UK territory.\n\nAnother amendment moved by Priti Patel, now home secretary, would stop the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU unless the EU agrees to collect them for the UK. That will not happen. Mr Johnson will have to change the law to make his plan work.\n\nDoes Northern Ireland have a say over this new plan?\n\nMr Johnson originally proposed last week that the Northern Ireland assembly \u2014 currently suspended \u2014 should vote on whether the region should stay part of the single market rule book and renew its consent every four years.\n\nMr Barnier told diplomats in Brussels that the prime minister had agreed to drop that proposal, which would have given the DUP an effective veto over any post-Brexit arrangement.\n\nDifferent \u201cconsent\u201d mechanisms are now being discussed to ensure the people of Northern Ireland approve. That could require the backing of both unionist or nationalist communities or perhaps just a simple majority, expressed through a referendum.\n\nHow does this proposal compare with Theresa May\u2019s Irish backstop plan?\n\nAlthough the DUP rejected Mrs May\u2019s deal three times, Mr Johnson\u2019s plan is arguably more problematic for the unionist party.\n\nMrs May\u2019s plan had a \u201cbackstop\u201d arrangement which would have seen the whole of the UK remain in a customs union with the EU \u2014 to avoid a border in Ireland \u2014 with only a thin regulatory border in the Irish Sea. The backstop was a temporary arrangement to designed to fall away once a longer-term trade deal with the EU was agreed.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s idea would see a much thicker regulatory border and a new customs border in the Irish Sea, primarily to ensure that Mr Johnson and the DUP can honour their promise to keep Northern Ireland \u2014 legally at least \u2014 in the UK customs area.\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "Under the plan, Northern Ireland would remain legally part of the UK customs area but in practice would be part of the EU\u2019s customs territory.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2206%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f7a6c8b609bb816568e906057a26ccd09fe9ae2a", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
