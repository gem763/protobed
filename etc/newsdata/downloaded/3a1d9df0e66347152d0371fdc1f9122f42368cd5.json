Two charges were dismissed because of the low likelihood of a conviction.\n\nBoyle, 36, has pleaded not guilty on all counts.\n\nOne of the 17 charges he faces relates to administering a noxious substance, trazodone.\n\nBoyle told the court he took trazodone because of the recurring nightmares he was having after his family's ordeal in Afghanistan.\n\nBoyle said on Nov. 5, 2017, his wife was having a panic attack. He said in response he looked online and saw his prescription could be used to deal with anxiety, and offered Coleman some of the medication while she was taking a shower.\n\nBoyle told the Crown he was unsure what dosage he gave Coleman or if she took the pills he left in the bathroom.\n\n\"I remember her hands were wet. I remember putting them on the back of the toilet,\" Boyle told the court. \"I indicated to her the trazodone was there.\"\n\n\"Whether or not she took it was up to her.\"\n\nColeman said Boyle forced her to take trazodone\n\nIn previous testimony, Coleman said her husband forced her to take three trazodone tablets\u2013 double the dose he takes. She told court in March that she refused and Boyle hit her in the face, forcing her to take the prescription. She told the court she then felt dizzy, as though she was drunk.\n\nOn Tuesday, Crown lawyer Jason Neubauer accused Boyle of forcing her to take the drug to sedate her and to make her do what he wanted.\n\n\"You're just making this all up Mr. Boyle,\" Neubauer said. \"Mr. Boyle you can clearly see Ms. Coleman was suffering the effects of the medication. Her demeanour wasn't normal.\"\n\nBoyle denied the Crown's accusation.\n\nThroughout the trial, Boyle denies assaulting his wife or holding her against her will.\n\nBoyle said he was the victim of physical and emotional abuse from his wife and she repeatedly demanded sex from him; saying that her appetite had grown since leaving captivity.\n\nBoyle is expected to return to the witness stand Wednesday.", "description": "Former hostage Joshua Boyle \u2014\u00a0accused of assaulting his now-estranged wife, Caitlan Coleman\u00a0\u2014 denies drugging her to make her more compliant, and said in court on Tuesday he only offered her his medication to calm her.", "authors": ["David Thurton Is A National Reporter In Cbc'S Parliamentary Bureau.
