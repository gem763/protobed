She's in here for life anyway.\"\n\nThankfully another prisoner was able to wrestle her to the ground before she could land what would have been a fatal blow.\n\n(Image: michaella_mccollum/Instagram)\n\nIn her book You'll Never See Daylight Again, which is published at the end of the month, McCollum recounts how she got involved in smuggling as a 20-year-old.\n\nShe claimed that drugs were so freely available in Ibiza that customers would order cocaine or ecstasy with their meals while she was waitressing.\n\nDrug dealer Davey promised to pay her well for doing 'runs' to mainland Spain and bringing back illegal substances.\n\nBefore she could do her first trip to Barcelona, she was introduced to Mateo and the plan changed dramatically.\n\nShe was told she would be heading for Peru, which she thought was a city in Spain.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nIt was before they set off that she was introduced to Reid, and the duo waited at the home of a gang member.\n\nThey were stunned to discover drawers full of guns and passports, McCollum wrote.\n\nReid left before she did, and it was only while on the flight to Peru that a man next to her revealed she was heading for South America.\n\nThey were instructed to visit tourist sites and take pictures as part of their cover, before picking up the drugs.\n\n(Image: X03722)\n\nIt was at this point that she realised how serious their predicament was.\n\nShe wrote: \"Davey's Colombian friend might have paid a few guards to turn a blind eye, but you'd need to bribe the whole airport to get this amount through.\"\n\nAfter their arrest at the Jorge Chavez International Airport, both women were sentenced to six years in prison in December 2013.\n\nMcCollum was released on March 31 2016, and returned to Ireland in August that year.\n\nShe is set to profit from sales of her tell-all book, and has reportedly held talks about turning it into a TV series.", "description": "Michaella McCollum has opened up about the case which earned her worldwide notoriety in a tell-all book", "authors": ["Dave Burke", "Image", "Supplied Wenn", "Afp Getty Images", "Internet Unknown", "Reuters", "Icelebtv Jon", "Michaella_Mccollum Instagram", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14249885.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Channel-4-News.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
