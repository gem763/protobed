Stephen Miller, told ABC News.\n\nPolice made the arrest after the military issued a warrant for desertion out of Fort Hood, Miller said.\n\nOakley was directly booked into the Belly County Jail but has since been transferred and taken into custody by Fort Hood authorities.\n\nMiller said he could not offer more details on the arrest because his department was just assisting another agency.\n\nAndres Leighton/AP, FILE\n\nHe is being held on a third-degree felony charge, according to ABC El Paso affiliate KVIA.\n\nOfficials with Fort Hood could not immediately be reached by ABC News.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Aug. 3 shooting in El Paso, Oakley told KVIA that when shots rang out, he grabbed as many children as possible to get them away from the gunfire.\n\n\"What I did was exactly what I was supposed to do. I understand it was heroic and I'm looked at as a hero for it, but that wasn't the reason for me,\u201d he said at the time. \"I'm just focused on the kids that I could not [save] and the families. It hurts me. I feel like they were a part of me. I don't even know the people that died or the kids that I took with me.\"\n\nHe credited his military training as the reason he immediately sprung into action during the shooting, which left 22 people dead.\n\nOakley was listed as an automated logistical specialist stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas.", "description": "Glendon Oakley Jr. was hailed a hero after the El Paso shooting.
