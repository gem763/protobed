She pleaded guilty in June to wire fraud.\n\nThe club started in 1995 with five members and grew to 12, mostly women Yanow knew from the neighborhood and her synagogue.\n\nYanow has paid back about $81,000 in restitution. If the money had been invested as the club had directed, it would have grown to more than $400,000.\n\nClub member Bobby Miller told a judge during Friday's sentencing that it was \"betrayal beyond imagination.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, http://www.jsonline.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
