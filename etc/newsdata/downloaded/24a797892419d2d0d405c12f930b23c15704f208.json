This is because suspended sentences can only be given to prison terms of four years or less.\n\nSee also: Samsung's Q2 profit halved from low memory demand\n\nFollowing Park's impeachment in 2017, Lee and senior Samsung executives were arrested for bribery charges. Samsung's office was raided twice by local investigators over allegations that it bribed Choi to gain support for a controversial merger between two of its affiliates. This allegedly resulted in the formation of a de facto holding company that provided the founding Lee family with more control over the conglomerate.\n\nLee was eventually found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison that August, becoming the first Samsung boss to serve actual prison time. But in the appeal trial last year, his sentence was halved and the court gave him a suspended sentence which ultimately set him free.\n\n\"Samsung Electronics deeply regrets that this case has created concerns across the society. We will renew our commitment to carrying out the role of a responsible corporate citizen and will avoid a recurrence of past mistakes,\" Samsung said in a statement following the retrial order.\n\n\"During the past few years, Samsung has faced significant challenges from external and internal uncertainties and we have been constrained in our efforts to focus on leading new businesses for the future. In this increasingly uncertain and difficult economic environment, we ask for support and encouragement so we can rise above the challenges and continue to contribute to the broader economy,\" it added.\n\nLee has been actively taking part in management since his release, visiting Tokyo to meet Japanese business leaders amid the trade scuffle between South Korea and Japan while also promoting software talent in a visit to the company's academy.\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "It is the worst possible scenario for Samsung as its boss may face a heavier sentence than previously.", "authors": ["Cho Mu-Hyun"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/07/06/9f67e014-24d6-46cc-9610-47991fc17efb/thumbnail/770x578/bbbc86d405d4df9c7a3c9e1b11c8ca24/legal.jpg"}
