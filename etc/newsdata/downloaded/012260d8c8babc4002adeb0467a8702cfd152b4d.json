Under $200: These noise-canceling headphones with extra bass at their lowest price\n\nSave on these incredible headphones. (Photo: Sony)\n\nEarlier this year, Sony disrupted the noise-canceling headphone market with the release of the WH-1000XM3 noise cancelling headphones. They\u2019re our favorite noise-canceling headphones\u2014even better than Bose's insanely popular QuietComfort series\u2014and right now, there is a similar pair on sale for a great low price on Amazon. The WH-XB900N headphones are usually $248, but right now you can get them for $50 off, the best price we've ever seen. These headphones are $100 cheaper than the XM3s because they don't feature the same active noise canceling technology. But they still have noise cancelation and also offer extra bass so you can really sink into your beats, as well as 30 hours of battery life, touch controls, and Alexa and Google Assistant connectivity.\n\nGet the Sony WH-XB900N Wireless Extra Bass Headphones on Amazon for $198 (Save $52)\n\n5.
