He added a potential deal could be worth more than $40 million over five years. He made the revelation during an appearance on \u201cGet Up.\u201d\n\nHALL OF FAMER TROY AIKMAN SAYS PATRICK MAHOMES COMPARISON 'DOESN'T MAKE SENSE'\n\nSchefter was asked when Mahomes would get a \u201cmonster contract.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis offseason,\u201d Schefter said. \u201cAfter this year ends he\u2019s eligible to sign his first long-term deal or his first second contract and he is expected at some point during the offseason to get a new deal done with the Chiefs that I would think, just guessing, is gonna be a deal in excess of $200 million over the course of that contract. \u201cSo let\u2019s just say five years, $40-plus million.\u201d\n\nTENNESSEE TITANS' DELANIE WALKER HAS ISSUE WITH PLAYERS NOT BEING ABLE TO TAKE CRITICISM\n\nCurrently, the richest contract in the sport belongs to Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson. He signed a four-year, $140 million deal in the offseason which included a $65 million signing bonus. He makes $35 million annually.\n\nIf Schefter's\u2019 guess is correct, Mahomes would certainly surpass Wilson\u2019s deal.\n\nIn his first full season as the Chiefs\u2019 starting quarterback, Mahomes passed for 5,097 yards and a league-leading 50 touchdowns. Through three games this season, he leads the league with 1,195 passing yards and 10 touchdowns. He has yet to throw an interception.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMahomes led the Chiefs to the AFC Championship game, where they lost in overtime to the eventual Super Bowl-champion New England Patriots. The Chiefs might have won if not for an offsides penalty on the defense at a pivotal moment during the title game.", "description": "Patrick Mahomes has quickly become one of the best quarterbacks in football and the next question that will surround him is how much that is worth to the Kansas City Chiefs.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
