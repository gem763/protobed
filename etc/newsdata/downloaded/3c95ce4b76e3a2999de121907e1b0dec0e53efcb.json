Pictured, an illustration of Mars' evaporite lakes as they may have appeared around 3.3\u20133.7 billion years ago\n\nFrom this, the researchers have determined that these salts are traces of an period of high salinity for the crater's lake which likely occurred as the lake's water evaporates.\n\nThus, the researchers infer that the measurements are evidence of an interval of high salinity of the crater's lake that may have occurred as water evaporated.\n\n'Our findings support step-wise changes in Martian climate during the Hesperian, leading to more arid and sulfate-dominated environments as previously inferred from orbital observations,' the researchers wrote in their paper.\n\nLooking forward, Curiosity will be continuing to explore Gale crater and will examine even younger-aged rocks to shine further light on the drying of the Martian surface.\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal Nature Geoscience.", "description": "Planetary scientist William Rapin of the California Institute of Technology and colleagues studied data collected from Mars' Gale crater by NASA's Curiosity rover.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/15/19400054-0-image-a-24_1570458793053.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
