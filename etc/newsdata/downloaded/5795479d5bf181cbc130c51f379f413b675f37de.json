NASA said at the time that the new goal, known as Artemis, was part of a \"two-phased approach: the first is focused on speed\u2014landing astronauts on the moon in five years\u2014while the second will establish a sustained human presence on and around the moon by 2028.\"\n\nBut in a recent hearing, Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano (D-N.Y.), chairman of the U.S. House Appropriations Committee\u2019s commerce, justice, and science subcommittee, expressed doubt about the two-phase plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to justify any extra spending on this effort in the current fiscal year when we don\u2019t know the costs down the road,\u201d Serrano said in his opening statement, per SpaceNews. The original goal of solely focusing on 2028 would allow NASA to \"have a successful, safe, and cost-effective mission for the benefit of the American people and the world.\u201d\n\nSerrano also suggested that the 2024 date might have political motivations. \"To a lot of members, the motivation appears to be just a political one\u2014giving President Trump a moon landing in a possible second term, should he be reelected,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in favor of the 2024 date, Bridenstine said that \"the challenge that we have as a nation is that the longer programs go, the more political risk that we have.\"\n\n\"When we look back to history,\" he continued, \"the Space Exploration Initiative, it took decades in time and it eventually got canceled.\"\n\nThe Space Exploration Initiative, launched in 1989 by President George H.W Bush, was meant to establish a long-term human presence on the Moon before being canceled by President Bill Clinton in 1996.\n\n\"There are two types of risk,\" Bridenstine said. \"Technical risk and political risk. It's not partisan, but when programs start going too long, people lose confidence.\"\n\nBut Serrano, noting that NASA hasn't yet offered a full price tag for the 2024 launch, said that \"unless we know what this is going to cost at the end, it would be irresponsible for us to take the first step.\"\n\nRep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.) took issue with Bridenstine's \"down payment\" comment, comparing NASA's request to buying a car with only a down payment and not knowing the total price. \u201cThat\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to know the total cost.\u201d\n\nRepublicans were also concerned about the new date, saying it might weaken efforts to expand the growing private industry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that NASA could undercut its flexibility and incur unnecessary costs by foregoing opportunities to leverage existing assets in an attempt to simultaneously foster a commercial space economy,\u201d said Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.), the subcommittee\u2019s ranking member.\n\nAderholt focused his questions on NASA's still under-construction Space Launch System (SLS), meant to be the agency's next generation of interplanetary rockets. Earlier this year, Bridenstine admitted the SLS might not be able to launch NASA missions in the 2020s.\n\n\u201cGiven our current rate of production, we will have three SLS\u2019s available\u201d by 2024, Bridenstine said in response, \u201cand the third one would be for Artemis 3, that takes us to the moon in 2024. I think that is fully within the realm of possibility, but a lot of things have to go right to make that happen.\u201d\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Congress is skeptical we can make it back in four years, when we don't even know how much it will cost.", "authors": ["David Grossman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wNAcDJUAliDiiVirlTfc.w--~B/aD03MjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_mechanics_642/7fab6d0e577e916a8ca59f526d150220", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
