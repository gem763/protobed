Securing the funds would unlock a further $2.5bn (\u00a32bn) in financing from US investment bank JP Morgan.\n\nSirius has embarked on a strategic review, and unless the company finds another way to raise the money in next few months, its future looks bleak.\n\n\"We can't do anything at present,\" said Mr Howard, who initially bought shares at 24p each. \"We can't pull out because [the share price] is basically next to nothing.\"\n\nImage copyright Sirius Minerals Image caption Sirius Minerals has begun construction on the \u00a34bn fertiliser mine project\n\nMr Howard said that before the Sirius investment \"I was just content for a life of retirement and just enjoy my pensions. But I'm now down to the normal old age [state] pension\".\n\nRegeneration\n\nThe company has 85,000 individual shareholders. About 10,000 of these are located in areas surrounding the Teesside project, where many people no doubt invested because of the regenerative benefits for the North East.\n\nAt 5%, the region has the highest unemployment rate in England and Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics. Sirius said the project would generate about 4,000 jobs.\n\nThe plan is to develop the Woodsmith mine, near Whitby, to give the company access to a vast deposit of polyhalite, which can be used as a fertiliser.\n\nImage copyright Sirius Minerals Image caption Polyhalite can be used as a fertiliser for crops\n\nThe polyhalite will be transported along a 23-mile tunnel and conveyor belt to Teesside near the former Redcar steelworks, which closed in 2015 and cost 2,200 people their jobs.\n\nWhen Andrew Davies, 59, and his friend were weighing up whether to invest in Sirius six years ago, the boost to the local economy was a factor in their decision.\n\n\"Lots of the locals were really, really happy because obviously it is regeneration of their area which is fantastic,\" he said.\n\n\"Because the share price at the time was quite low, we thought it had great growth, it would supplement our pensions and support a British company as well.\"\n\nFortunately, Mr Davies bought some Sirius shares when they were less than a penny and the highest he paid was 7p.\n\nStill, he has put \u00a360,000 of his money into the company. \"I'm obviously very upset as to what has gone on,\" he said.\n\nConserving cash\n\nIt also emerged this week that the government would not provide a $1bn loan guarantee to Sirius. \"The government in reality should be backing this,\" he said. \"It is a massive boost for the country.\"\n\nFinancially, Mr Davies said it hasn't created difficulties for him. \"Right from day one, I've made sure that my investments don't impair any of my pensions as such, because at the end of the day this was something that was to enhance my pension not to take a risk with my pension.\"\n\nBut he can't really do much with his Sirius shares.\n\nImage copyright Sirius Minerals Image caption The Woodsmith mine site near Whitby\n\nIn an effort to conserve cash, Sirius has slowed work at the site where 1,200 people have been working, the vast majority of which are employed by third party construction firms.\n\nSirius had hoped to start producing polyhalite next year. It has struck deals to supply 11.7 million tonnes of it a year to businesses.\n\nHowever, it is yet to sink two shafts to a depth of 1,500 metres at the Woodsmith mine to allow for production.\n\nThe race is now on to find an investor to fund the next stages of development - or maybe even a buyer for the business.\n\nImage copyright Brian Pieters\n\nMr Davies is going to hang onto his shares. \"There is no point in selling them now at such a loss. You may as well keep hold of them now and believe the Sirius line that one day it will come to fruition.\"\n\nMr Howard said the situation is \"very distressing especially for myself and my wife at our age\".\n\nHe said \"We know that buying stocks and shares is a gamble but this looked so, so good and they've already got massive orders in the pipeline from other countries.\n\n\"Personally, I don't think it will fail, I hope not anyway. I think we're just in for a rough, rocky ride for a few years.\"", "description": "Sirius Minerals has 85,000 small investors, but the company's troubles mean many are stuck in a hole.", "authors": ["Dearbail Jordan", "Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/185AE/production/_108885799_crop2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
