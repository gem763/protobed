Jefferson \u2014 who was black \u2014 was killed by the white officer, identified by police on Monday as Aaron Dean, when he fired a shot through her bedroom window.\n\n\u201cHad the officer not resigned, I would have fired him,\u201d Kraus said at a press conference on Monday, adding the officer broke protocols on use of force and de-escalation\n\nJefferson\u2019s family demanded in a separate news conference on Monday that the officer immediately be fired and that city recuse itself from the investigation.\n\n\u201cFort Worth needs to recuse themselves from this investigation,\u201d said S. Lee Merritt, the lawyer for Jefferson\u2019s family. \u201cThey need to bring in an outside agency.\u201d\n\nAsked why he and the family did not trust local authorities to investigate, Merritt replied: \u201cExperience.\u201d\n\nKraus said he reached out to the Texas Rangers, but they declined to take on the investigation at the time. He also said they sent information for the FBI to look into potential civil rights violations. Kraus said Dean, who joined the Fort Worth police in 2018, has not been cooperative with investigators.\n\nThe family demanded swift repercussions in a press conference on Monday, adding the officer \u2014 who at that point had not been identified \u2014 should be charged with a crime. Kraus said he would have an update on any criminal charges against Dean on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fort Worth and Dallas community is once again left reeling by a police-involved death that is difficult to understand \u2014 Jefferson\u2019s death comes just a few weeks after the former cop who killed unarmed black man Botham Jean was sentenced to a decade in prison.\n\nDozens of people gathered near Jefferson\u2019s home Sunday night for a candlelight vigil that doubled as a protest, with chants of \u201cno justice, no peace.\u201d\n\n\"It's like from the moment we got the call, it's been more and more inconceivable and more confusing. And there has nothing been done in order to take away that confusion,\" Venitta Body, Jefferson's aunt, told CBS.\n\nREAD: Ex-Dallas cop Amber Guyger sentenced to 10 years in prison for murdering unarmed black man\n\nJust before being killed, Jefferson had been playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew. Jefferson had recently moved into the home to help take care of her ailing mother, family said.\n\nFort Worth, Texas police were called to the house via the non-emergency phone line after a concerned neighbor saw her door was open in the wee hours of Saturday morning.\n\nBodycam footage from the incident shows the officer \u2014 now identified as Dean \u2014 approaching the front of the home, where only the screen door was closed. Lights were on in the house and a car was parked out front.\n\nThe officer then went around the side of the house, approached the bedroom window, yelled \u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d and immediately fired a shot through the glass.\n\nMerritt said on Monday that the family appreciated the fact that the bodycam footage was released quickly, but questioned why the police also released images of a gun in Jefferson\u2019s home, which they did not state was a factor in the shooting.\n\n\u201cThey threw in an unrelated photograph of a firearm, in order to, I guess, impugn some bad act or blame [on Jefferson]\u2026 That\u2019s more like the Fort Worth we know,\u201d Merritt said at the press conference.\n\nKraus said on Monday that, \u201cin hindsight\u201d releasing images of the gun \u201cwas a bad thing to do.\u201d\n\nREAD: Witness in Amber Guyger trial was killed in a drug deal gone wrong, cops say\n\nBodycam footage showed Dean never identified himself as police before shooting Jefferson. Emergency medical services were administered but were not able to save her life.\n\n\u201cWhat the officer observed and why he did not announce \u2018police\u2019 will be addressed as the investigation continues,\u201d Kraus told reporters on Sunday.\n\nThere are obvious and disturbing parallels between Jefferson\u2019s killing and the death of Jean, who was killed last year in his own home in Dallas by an off-duty cop. His killer, Amber Guyger, was just sentenced to 10 years in prison earlier this month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still struggling with the fact that a neighbor called, concerned about a neighbor, and this is the result that came from that care and concern,\u201d Kelly Allen Gray, a city councilwoman who represents the neighborhood where Jefferson was killed, told the New York Times. \u201cThat cannot be the end of stories of people who care about each other. This cannot be the ending.\u201d\n\nA GoFundMe for the family has raised more than $145,000 as of Monday morning. Amber Carr, Jefferson\u2019s sister and the mother of the small boy who witnessed the shooting, said her son has comforted her as she struggles to deal with the trauma of her sister\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cHe holds me, he hugs me, these are the things I should be doing for him \u2026 he\u2019s helping me to be strong and I believe my sister had a big part in that,\u201d she said.\n\nCover: In this Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019, image made from a body camera video released by the Fort Worth Police Department an officer shines a flashlight into a window in Fort Worth, Texas.
