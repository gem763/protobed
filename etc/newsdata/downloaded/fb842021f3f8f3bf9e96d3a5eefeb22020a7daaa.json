Adding to their pain: Last week the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted ethanol waivers to 31 refineries, a decision that could dampen demand for corn. U.S. corn and ethanol prices have dropped sharply this month.\n\nFor companies like Deere & Co., which reported results on Friday, the condition of some of its biggest customers is a concern. The company said profit in its third quarter ended July 28 declined to $899 million, from $910 million last year. Earnings per share lagged behind analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nAlthough strong agriculture markets in Brazil and Argentina helped buoy Deere\u2019s performance and the shares rose in morning trading, Chief Executive Officer Samuel Allen said the results reflected \u201cthe high degree of uncertainty\u201d overshadowing the U.S. agricultural sector. \u201cConcerns about export-market access, near-term demand for commodities such as soybeans, and overall crop conditions, have caused many farmers to postpone major equipment purchases,\u201d Mr. Allen said.\n\nHeard on the Street's Summertime Stock Picks Leaderboard\n\nThe U.S. manufacturing sector overall is suffering as a result of trade frictions: Output has fallen more than 1.5% since December, according to the Federal Reserve. But making farm equipment is an especially tough business at the moment. Over the first six months of this year, China\u2019s agricultural imports from the U.S. were down 20% from the same period last year.\n\nDeere, which operates globally, can pivot somewhat, and its South American customers are indirect beneficiaries of trade tensions. But its business is still vulnerable, and U.S. farmers, among its largest customers, aren\u2019t as lucky. As President Trump threatened fresh tariffs, China said earlier this month that it would suspend all imports of U.S. agricultural products in retaliation. The Iowa Corn Growers Association estimates that the recent ethanol exemptions could zap another billion bushels of corn demand.\n\nFor Deere, U.S. purchases of its equipment may suffer until the uncertainty settles. The company brought down its forecast for its U.S. and Canadian agriculture business and now expects a 4% increase in equipment sales this year overall, down from previous estimates of a 5% rise.
