She feared she was going to die.\n\nMackenzie in hospital following her first nerve surgery (Picture: MDWfeatures / Mackenzie Lea)\n\nMackenzie said: \u2018I remember my first facial pain was when I was 10, then it stopped for a while and resumed when I was 12.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I attributed the pain to migraines, but the pain became debilitating when I was 15 and I knew it wasn\u2019t just migraines anymore. I thought I had a brain tumour and that I was dying because I didn\u2019t think that such a level of pain was possible without knocking on death\u2019s door.\n\n\u2018I was putting makeup on so touching my face when the pain was triggered. I was terrified and I had no idea what was happening.\u2019\n\nDoctors began a process to trying to rule out what she could be suffering from and put her on a course of drugs, antibiotics and allergy medication.\n\nDuring another flare, in October 2013, Mackenzie was kept in hospital for a week for brain scans and fluid taken from her spine.\n\nMackenzie has been living in pain since she was 10 (Picture: MDWfeatures / Mackenzie Lea)\n\nAll tests came back negative so Mackenzie was referred to the complex pain clinic.\n\nIn April 2014, she discussed previous scans and the medication already tried with her physician.\n\n\u2018I talked with the doctor for a couple of minutes about my scans and he medication I had tried,\u2019 she said. \u2018He decided to do a physical exam and he asked if the pain affects one side, so I said it was mostly on my right side.\n\n\u2018He asked if it would hurt when he touched my face and I said that I\u2019d rather him not touch it because it would hurt. Then he said he knew what I had and asked if I could give him a couple of minutes to do some research.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When he came back, his face had gone from bright to pale and he said he\u2019d never seen a case in children, but it was trigeminal neuralgia.\n\nThe debilitating illness has left Mackenzie out of school, no longer dancing and fearing she might hold her boyfriend back (Picture: MDWfeatures / Mackenzie Lea)\n\n\u2018I felt a number of emotions but the main one was relief because all I had wanted was a diagnosis. I told myself that once I had a diagnosis then they could treat me and I\u2019d be fine. I never imagined that modern medicine wouldn\u2019t be able to treat something.\n\n\u2018The look on his face was a bit unsettling and I knew he was going to tell me something bad. I was told that it was a form of nerve damage that was very rare, and there wasn\u2019t an easy fix.\u2019\n\nPassengers wrap drunk man in cling film after he tried to kick open plane door\n\nShe had to be taken off strong medication after breaking out in sores, leaving doctors with no choice but to try complex surgery aimed at easing pressure on the nerves in her head.\n\nShe underwent surgery but within three months was back at the Intensive Pain Rehabilitation Program, which involved physical, mental and occupational therapy to cope with her condition.\n\nHer life stopped, forcing her to give up her dreams of studying medicine, as any slight movement or stimulation to her face left her suffering for days.\n\nDespite this, Mackenzie said she is thankful her boyfriend Jon knew her before the illness took hold, and before she was housebound, although the condition makes it painful to kiss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMackenzie turned 18 in February 2016 and was transferred to an adult neurologist who took a different approach including Botox, blocks and infusions.\n\nShe underwent second nerve surgery in July this year which has left her with far less intensive or frequent pain than before.\n\n\u2018I do have flare-ups now and then but it\u2019s not progressing,\u2019 she added. \u2018Before, I was planning on going to med school and I was a dancer too but all of that stopped.\n\n\u2018The side effects from medication and the pain itself make it too hard to focus and learn.\n\n\u2018I can barely move without being overwhelmed by pain, so working isn\u2019t an option. There are things I wanted in the future, like having children, which may not be possible anymore.\n\n\u2018I feel lucky that my boyfriend knew me before my illness and he got to see my at my full capacity. He\u2019s seen what I\u2019m capable of, in both an able and disabled body.\n\n\u2018One of the hardest things is feeling like a burden as he\u2019s young and able and I worry about holding him back. It also sometimes hurts to kiss him, which can be really frustrating for us.\n\n\u2018Even if someone isn\u2019t dealing with this disease specifically, everyone has their own burdens to carry. I\u2019d love to show people that being dealt a bad hand doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have a fulfilling life.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
