She cut her holiday short when her foot blistered and started to become infected (left before treatment, and right, after)\n\nMedics told Ms Wilkes the bite was likely from a spider bite and if left any longer she may have been forced to undergo an amputation\n\nAfter being pumped with seven different antibiotics and spending over four months in intensive care, the infection cleared up on its own.\n\nBut Ms Wilkes is still traumatised by the ordeal and is recovering from her holiday nightmare at home.\n\nShe said: 'We recently lost our dad, Raymond to lung cancer and to cheer ourselves up, unwind and relax my sister, Carrie, and I booked a holiday.\n\n'We hoped to spend a week soaking up the sun and sipping cocktails, but it turned into a holiday from hell after I was bitten by an insect.\n\n'From the moment my leg began hurting, I knew something was wrong, but I didn't want to waste anybody's time.\n\n'After it started scabbing and I had difficulty walking, I knew I needed to get help, but the Spanish doctors just fobbed me off as another \"British drunk\" - I was horrified.\n\n'I trusted my gut instinct and flew home straight away and I'm glad I did, as doctors in the UK said I would have died - or would have at least needed my limb amputated - if I didn't get treatment within 24 hours.\n\n'Although I'm thankful I've been able to keep my leg, I'm still battling with the after affects that this mystery bug has left me, but I'm getting there - slowly but surely.'\n\nMs Wilkes was told by doctors in the UK that her infection had triggered sepsis - the body\u2019s often deadly response to infection or injury.\n\nSepsis kills and disables millions and requires early treatment for the best chance of survival.\n\nThe condition, an overreaction by the immune system which sees it attack healthy cells, made her dizzy and violently sick and caused her temperature to soar.\n\nMs Wilkes said she initially dismissed her sore foot and presumed it would go away later that night.\n\nShe added: 'I felt like I had been stabbed in my left leg. It instantly began burning up and I thought it was probably just a silly mosquito bite, so I went into the pool to cool it off.\n\n'But as I went in, my leg started to burn up more and my toes began bleeding, which I thought was odd, but dismissed it until the next morning, as I didn't want to waste anybody's time.'\n\nAfter spending her evening walking about she had excruciating pain in her foot so she decided to go home early and wait until the next day to seek help.\n\nShe claims she was turned away from a hospital in Spain as medics thought she was a 'typical drunk Brit'. Here she's pictured with her sister Carrie in Benidorm before the ordeal\n\nThe mother had been lounging around the pool when she was bitten by a bug. A red mark instantly appeared, but she thought nothing of it and spritzed herself with insect repellent to prevent further bites\n\nIt was only when she began struggling to put weight on her foot, and the blisters turned green, four days into her trip that she started to worry\n\nShe added: 'I woke up in the middle of the night was shooting pain up and down my leg and when I tried to stand up to get to the bathroom, I collapsed on the floor.'\n\nAfter suffering through the night, she called a taxi and went straight to hospital for an X-ray the following morning.\n\nShe said: 'I was in so much pain and when the doctor came back to tell me the x-ray looked like I just had a sprained ankle, I was furious.\n\n'I think they thought I was just another British drunk who had fallen over, but even though I told them I hadn't sprained it, they sent me back to the hotel with a pair of crutches.'\n\nMs Wilkes trusted her gut instinct and left her sister in Benidorm and flew home three days early, but had to be wheeled on to her flight.\n\n'I was too weak to walk on my own and I began being sick every five minutes as I boarded the flight,' she said.\n\nMs Wilkes was admitted to intensive care in Royal Surrey Hospital and diagnosed with cellulitis.\n\nHer foot was covered in blisters, and doctors warned they may have to open up her leg and flush out the infection, or if that didn't work - amputate her leg.\n\nShe said: 'I was absolutely horrified, as I didn't think a measly bite from a bug in Benidorm would result... in the loss of my leg.\n\nShe had booked the holiday with her sister Carrie to cheer themselves up after the death of their father Raymond, 66, to lung cancer (pictured together)\n\n'Luckily, they were able to flush out the infection without having to do any invasive surgery, but I still feel incredibly weak.\n\n'They couldn't find the bug in my system, so were unable to work out which one caused me to have sepsis, but I'm glad that I went to the hospital when I did, as I was close to death.'\n\nDoctors told Ms Wilkes that if hadn't got to the hospital she could have been dead within 24 hours.\n\nShe said: 'Although they got rid of the infection, my foot and leg is still scarred and my circulation is awful, so I have to keep it propped up near enough 24/7.\n\n'I think it was either a dirty spider or mosquito that brought this pain and distress upon me - but I will never know.'\n\n'The main thing is that I'm alive and I still have my left leg and foot - but I know I still have a long way to go until I'm out of the woods. I had to learn to walk again and build up my strength.'", "description": "Faye Wilkes, 41, from Kent, was sunbathing by the pool when she felt a sharp nip on her left foot.
