But Trump has repeatedly denied that he is using the presidency to promote his resorts. \u201cI have a lot of hotels all over the place, and people, they use them because they\u2019re the best,\u201d he told reporters recently.\n\nTrump ignored calls to fully separate from his eponymous company, which comprises more than 500 businesses, after he was sworn into office. He still owns his business but placed his holdings in a trust designed to hold assets for his benefit and can receive money from the trust without the public\u2019s knowledge.\n\nForeign leaders know that. And as they have gotten to know Trump, they have learned to regularly mention his properties in what appear to be attempts to flatter him.\n\nIn June 2018, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave Trump a photo of his family\u2019s first property in that country as a gift. In July, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky told Trump he had stayed in Trump Tower in New York in their infamous call .\n\nAnd this year, in another meeting with the Irish leader, it was the prime minister who first mentioned a Trump property when he asked during an Oval Office meeting about whether the upcoming St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade in New York passes Trump Tower.\n\nTrump laughed and replied that it did. \u201cI used to watch it all the time,\u201d Trump told him. \u201cI would watch it all the time. So you\u2019ll be there on Saturday?\u201d\n\nA former senior administration official said Trump likes talking about his properties with foreign leaders \u2014 \u201cnot necessarily\u201d to boost his businesses but to display dominance. \u201cIt\u2019s literally to show how big and powerful I am,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt\u2019s bragging rights.\u201d\n\nTrump has invited the leaders of seven countries \u2014 Japan, China, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic \u2014 to meet with him at Mar-a-Lago, the resort he has dubbed the Winter White House. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been twice to Mar-a-Lago, which he described to Trump as \u201cgorgeous\u201d in 2017 and 2018, staying overnight at least once as a personal gift from Trump, though the Japanese government didn\u2019t answer questions about the second visit. He also has been to Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter and Trump Tower, according to 1100 Pennsylvania, which tracks visits to Trump properties.\n\nThe White House, State Department and other governments didn\u2019t respond to questions about whether other leaders stayed overnight.\n\nAn official who worked for Trump after he was elected during the transition acknowledged that Trump mentioned his properties regularly in conversations with leaders but not to get them to stay there. \u201cHe\u2019s just trying to relate,\u201d the person said. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for issues of commonality, just trying to personally connect with someone.\u201d\n\nTrump reportedly asked the president of Argentina to help with permitting problem in Buenos Aires in their first call after the election and spoke to the prime minister of Georgia about his failed development at a White House meeting, according to media reports, but the three former officials say it goes beyond that.\n\nFilipino ambassador to the U.S. Jose Manuel Romualdez, who held an independence day celebration at Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington, said the location made a statement, according to Filipino media . \u201cHaving it in a hotel that happens to have his name is not necessarily the end-all be-all, it\u2019s a statement. It\u2019s a statement that we have a good relationship with this president,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump frequently visits his properties \u2014 primarily in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia \u2014 and has traveled to them more than 300 times since he was sworn into office, according to a compilation of information released by the White House. He\u2019s visited his resorts both in Scotland and Ireland, and even considered canceling his trip to Ireland when the prime minister scoffed at meeting at his golf course, the Irish Times reported.\n\nWhen he was running for president, Trump acknowledged the influence his customers have with him. \u201cSaudi Arabia, I get along with all of them,\u201d he said in 2016. \u201cThey buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them?\u201d\n\nHis company donated nearly $200,000 to the U.S. Treasury in February that it said came from profits from foreign governments, but watchdog groups say the amount should higher.\n\nRevenue increased at many of the resorts Trump visited in 2018, including the Trump International Hotel in Washington, which has become a top destination for Republicans, according to Trump\u2019s most recent personal financial disclosure forms. That comes even as Trump\u2019s overall income dipped slightly from $450 million in 2017 to $434 million in 2018.\n\nIn January, Trump ran into Kurdish Leader Ilham Ahmed at his Washington hotel, where the president was attending a fundraiser and proclaimed the U.S. would not abandon the Kurds. \u201dI love the Kurds,\u201d Trump said.\n\nBut two weeks ago, Trump reversed course in Syria, moving U.S. troops from northern Syria, leaving the Kurds to take on Turkey alone and some questioning whether his business was a factor.\n\nTrump made the decision after a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who attended the opening of Trump's towers in Istanbul in 2012. Since Trump was sworn into office, at least five events affiliated with the Turkish government have been held at Trump properties.\n\nIn 2015, Trump acknowledged his properties posed a conflict of interest in Turkey \u2014 though he denies they do now.\n\n\u201cI have a little conflict of interest \u2019cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul,\u201d he said on a Breitbart radio show. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendously successful job. It\u2019s called Trump Towers.\u201d\n\nDaniel Lippman contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": ["Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a6/e2/7092fec74b37a0ef0944cbbb0b26/191019-trump-varadkar-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
