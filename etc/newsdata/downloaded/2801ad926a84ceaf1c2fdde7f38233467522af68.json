Did you know that place is haunted?\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: Matt Frost/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nA shocked Holly said: \"Why are you telling me this? Has anyone ever seen anything?\"\n\nPhillip told her: \"It's haunted by the airmen who have died. Their bodies have been brought back from war. Some of the crew have seen ghosts.\"\n\nJudge Ashley Banjo has also been effected by the spirits in the past.\n\nThe Diversity star once said he spends as little time in the studio as he possibly can after seeing a spooky mist that others say they've seen too.\n\nHe said: \"I've seen a few mists. I'm not going to lie. I go from the changing room to the stage. No wondering around.\"\n\n(Image: Matt Frost/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nOthers have reported seeing it too.\n\nA source told The Daily Star : \"The mist has been seen by several people. They say it suddenly appears and is so thick you can\u2019t see through it.\n\n\"One person is rumoured to have seen it late at night on the runway.\n\n\"Some friends of his were waiting in a car six metres away and they said it followed him. It was engulfing him.\"\n\nBest magazine reported that last year a paranormal investigator had come all the way from Minnesota in America to investigate the Airfield.\n\n(Image: Matt Frost/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nAdrian Lee, founder of the International Paranormal Society, told the mag: \"There's a lot of electromagnetic field activity.\n\n\"I had an American pilot come through called Charlie. He said his engine was on fire, he didn't think he'd make it and to tell his wife that he loves her.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
