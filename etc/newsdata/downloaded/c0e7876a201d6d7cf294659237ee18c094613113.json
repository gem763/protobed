Neither man had set a lap time and they will both start from the the very back, albeit a chassis change for Kubica means he will start from the pit lane.\n\nIn Q2 Mercedes were first and second but Ferrari again found pace when they needed it. Alexander Albon, who has yet to secure a seat at Red Bull for 2020, encouragingly posted exactly the same time as team-mate Max Verstappen.\n\nAlbon will start in sixth, behind the Dutchman, due to Verstappen setting his time first, but it was an important and impressive lap, especially given he has never driven around this track before and Suzuka is seen as one of the great \"drivers' tracks\".\n\nAfter qualifying Vettel said: \"It was not easy. Obviously the conditions are very different to what we had on Friday but the main thing is that the sun is out, people are happy.\n\n\"I think we\u2019re quite surprised. We didn\u2019t expect to have the front row lockout. I really enjoyed it.\"\n\nLeclerc, who had out-qualified Vettel nine races in a row before this, said that Vettel was difficult to beat.\n\n\"Seb did an amazing lap and he deserves to be on pole today. He was just too quick, so congratulations to him. We're surprised but happy to be 1-2 on the grid but it's the race that counts the most,\" he said.\n\nFinal Positions after Qualifying", "description": "Sebastian Vettel put his Ferrari on pole position for the Japanese Grand Prix.", "authors": ["Luke Slater"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/formula-1/2019/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000212866208-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
