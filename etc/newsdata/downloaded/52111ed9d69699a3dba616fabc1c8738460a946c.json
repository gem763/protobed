REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo\n\nThe exhibition at the Louvre Museum brought together in one place works by the Renaissance master, many of them loaned from institutions in different parts of the world.\n\nBut \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d, which sold for $450.3 million in November 2017, was a notable absence. The New York auction house that sold it said it was acquired by an Abu Dhabi branch of the Louvre, but it has not gone on display there or been seen publicly since the sale.\n\nThe exhibition in Paris featured a version of the same painting made by one of da Vinci\u2019s disciples.\n\n\u201cThe Louvre Museum has no announcements to make about that,\u201d a Louvre spokeswoman said on Thursday when asked if the real \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d might make an appearance in the exhibition, which runs until Feb. 24 next year.\n\nThe Louvre is already home to the artist\u2019s most famous artwork, the Mona Lisa. That work is not part of the exhibition and has remained on display in a different part of the museum.\n\nDa Vinci left his native Italy when his patron died and spent his last years in France as the guest of the French monarch. He died in May 1519 at the Loire Valley chateau that had become his home.\n\nOne of the loaned artworks, \u201cVitruvian Man\u201d, was the subject of a political tussle, with some groups in Italy, where the work is kept, saying it should not go to France.\n\nBut the piece took its place among the artworks in the exhibition on Thursday, after a judge in Venice authorised the loan. It will stay at the Louvre for just eight weeks before going home. The Louvre cited its fragility as the reason for the curtailed stay.\n\nThe exhibition has been an instant hit. According to the museum, 260,000 tickets have already been sold.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be the biggest, best exhibition on Leonardo that\u2019s taken place in an awfully long time,\u201d said Alan Kanzer, from New York, who was in the Louvre\u2019s courtyard on Thursday.", "description": "A major exhibition marking 500 years since the death of Leonardo da Vinci opened in Paris on Thursday but there was intrigue over whether the \"Salvator Mundi\" painting of Christ, one of the best-known works attributed to the master, would make a late appearance.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444518944&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N19S-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
