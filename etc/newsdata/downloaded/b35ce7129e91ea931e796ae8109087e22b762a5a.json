It falls way short, way short,\u201d he added.\n\nHis remarks come after House Democrats unveiled their resolution on Tuesday night.\n\nThe resolution, which could be voted on as soon as this week, sets up procedures for open hearings by the Intelligence Committee and releasing witness testimony.\n\nIt also allows Republicans to request witness testimony and documents, similar to previous impeachment inquiries. But Democrats on the Intelligence panel still have the ability to block the requests.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee also released a set of procedures for its impeachment hearings pursuant to the resolution. The procedures allow the president and his counsel to attend hearings, question witnesses and provide evidence.\n\nBut the resolution is unlikely to satisfy Senate Republicans, who have made criticism of the process around the House impeachment inquiry a key part of their strategy.\n\n\u201cIt does not confer on President Trump the most basic rights of due process or seemingly alter Chairman Schiff's unfair process in the House Intelligence Committee in any way whatsoever,\u201d McConnell said on Wednesday, referring to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSondland emerges as key target after Vindman testimony White House: Democrats' resolution shows impeachment is 'illegitimate sham' House votes to recognize Armenian genocide MORE (D-Calif.).\n\nMcConnell argued that Democrats are giving \u201cno due process now, maybe some later.
