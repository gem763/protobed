You will be taken care of.\n\n(Image: SESAME STREET)\n\n\"Addiction is a sickness and, as with any sickness, people need help to get better. And most importantly: It\u2019s not your fault.\"\n\nSalia's parents Sam and Jaana Woodbury, from Orange County, California, said they welcome the awareness the show has brought to the issue.\n\nJanna, who has been in recovery for about eight years, told the site: \"When I was going through addiction, I felt extremely alone and isolated. I didn't have any connection to the outside world.\n\n\"I think it's amazing that Sesame Street is using their platform to share resources to help other women and fathers.\"", "description": "The character, named Karli, has been created to teach children that grown-up problems aren't their fault", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Sesame Street"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20557755.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_care-because-her-mother-is-battling-an-opioid-addiction_5844JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
