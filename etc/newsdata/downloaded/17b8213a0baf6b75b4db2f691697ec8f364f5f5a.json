A late dinner for a lone consultant at a San Francisco Starbucks is $50, please, and a month\u2019s worth of copying and printing adds $6,944.80. Actual litigation? That\u2019ll be $554,811, just for June at one firm. And preparing a bill for the court adds another $35,015.\n\nAll told, fees and related expenses for lawyers, bankers and restructuring experts advising PG&E and its creditors burned up about $140 million since the company went bust in January, court filings show. That\u2019s more than $1 million for every weekday since the case began -- an expense that potentially cuts into funds that would go to victims of wildfires started by PG&E\u2019s equipment.\n\nThose liabilities are what forced PG&E into the biggest utility bankruptcy in U.S. history. If the company exits court protection as planned by June 2020, and bills keep piling up at the current pace, the total could surpass $400 million.\n\nEye-Popping\n\n\u201cThe numbers are eye-popping, but that\u2019s just how much bankruptcy costs,\u201d said Jared Ellias, a professor of bankruptcy law at the University of California Hastings. And that\u2019s not counting the court fight over PG&E\u2019s soon-to-be released reorganization plan, or the millions in adviser fees to get it through the California Public Utilities Commission. \u201cThen these costs are going to multiply,\u201d he said.\n\nNone of this is illegal or underhanded. Court hearings, legal briefs, cross-country airfares, first-class hotels and incidental expenses are customary parts of unraveling a big U.S. business failure, and San Francisco-based PG&E\u2019s case is unusually complex because it potentially involves fire victims, ratepayers, taxpayers, politicians and new legislation.\n\nPG&E said in an emailed statement that it hired advisers \u201cto help guide us through the complex Chapter 11 process \u2013 and help shape the business for the future \u2013 so that the company can remain focused on serving customers, enhancing our wildfire safety efforts, and working together with our stakeholders to create a more sustainable foundation for the delivery of safe, reliable and affordable service.\u201d\n\nThe largest sum so far came from New York law firm Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP, which submitted bills topping $30 million. The total included about $1 million in expenses such as hotel rooms at $600 per night, airfare to and from San Francisco, and rides with Uber and Lyft. That\u2019s on top of more than $75 million Cravath billed for the 12 months before the giant California energy utility sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, according to Bloomberg Law.\n\nAP Services, an affiliate of advisory firm AlixPartners LLC that is helping restructure PG&E, followed with about $16 million. Law firm Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP, which represents PG&E, rang up $14 million, with its June expenses meticulously documented in a filing almost 300 pages long.\n\nA representative for AlixPartners declined to comment; Weil Gotshal and Cravath didn\u2019t respond to messages.\n\nHourly Rates\n\nIn bankruptcy, all professionals working for the company, as well as those representing official creditor committees, must submit their bills to the judge overseeing the case.\n\nOf the more than 420 professionals listed in bills reviewed by Bloomberg, about 75 charged more than $1,000 an hour. The highest rates were charged by nearly three dozen attorneys who billed between $1,300 and $1,600 an hour.\n\nLawyers for wildfire victims say that the bankruptcy fees could have been money for compensating those claimants.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that we can save money anywhere, it ends up going to the victims,\u201d said Steven Campora, an attorney for wildfire victims who have sued PG&E. \u201cIt goes into their pockets.\u201d\n\nA separate law firm appointed to represent wildfire victims, BakerHostetler, has billed the estate $9 million for its work on the case. BakerHostetler represents the committee of tort claimants, while the committee of unsecured creditors hired Milbank LLP, which also billed $9 million.\n\nA representative for BakerHostetler declined to comment. Milbank didn\u2019t respond to a message.\n\nCosts and Benefits\n\n\u201cIn theory the large hourly rates come out of the pocket of creditors, but those creditors also have to think about where they would be without those expensive professionals,\u201d said Stephen Lubben, of the Seton Hall University School of Law. \u201cThe only people who benefit from a big fight among claimants are the ones who charge by the hour.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Little things add up fast in the bankruptcy of PG&E Corp.A six-minute phone call by a senior attorney costs the power company $102, filings show.
