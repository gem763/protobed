And according to Scorsese, it\u2019s \u2018not cinema,\u2019 I gotta take a look at that.\u201d\n\nStern interjected: \u201cBut it is cinema isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it plays in theaters,\u201d Downey Jr. said.\n\nStern asked: \u201cBut what did he mean by that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI appreciate his opinion because we can come to center and move on,\u201d Downey Jr. said.\n\nStern pressed: \u201cBut were you insulted when he said it\u2019s not cinema?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, look, it\u2019s like saying \u2018Howard Stern isn\u2019t radio,\u2019 it makes no sense to say it.\u201d\n\nStern: \u201cWas he jealous of the success?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not. He\u2019s Martin Scorsese.\u201d\n\nStern: \u201cThen what did he mean by that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn his view \u2014 and by the way, there\u2019s a lot to be said for how these genre movies, and I was happy to be part of the problem if there is one \u2014 denigrated the art form of cinema,\u201d Downey Jr. said. \u201cWhen you come in like a stomping beast and you eliminate the competition in such a demonstrative way, it\u2019s phenomenal.\u201d\n\nThe chat follows Avengers franchise star Samuel L. Jackson also commenting on the matter. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of like saying Bugs Bunny ain\u2019t funny,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cFilms are films. You know, everybody doesn\u2019t like his stuff either. I mean, we happen to, but everybody doesn\u2019t. There are a lot of Italian-Americans that don\u2019t think he should be making films about them like that. Everybody\u2019s got an opinion, so it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not going to stop anyone from making movies.\u201d\n\nMarvel directors James Gunn and Joss Whedon have also defended Marvel movies in the wake of the famed director\u2019s comments.\n\nRelated:\n\n\u2014 Which Marvel movie does Martin Scorsese probably hate the least?
