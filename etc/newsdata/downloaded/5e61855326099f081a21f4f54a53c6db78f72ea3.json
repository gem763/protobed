The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT!\" the president continued.\n\nThe White House announced late Sunday that Turkey will soon move forward with a planned military operation in northeast Syria, as U.S. troops who have been deployed and operating with Kurdish-led forces in the area began pulling back from their positions.\n\nThe decision sent shockwaves through the region and Washington, with U.S. officials telling Fox News that top Pentagon officials were \u201ccompletely blindsided\u201d and \u201cshocked\u201d by the order to pull back hundreds of U.S. troops, a move that effectively greenlights the Turkey operation. Trump spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by telephone.\n\nSome officials see the move as a betrayal of the Kurds, whom the U.S. supported against ISIS for years.\n\nSpeaking on \"Fox & Friends\" Monday morning, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham called it an \"impulsive decision\" by Trump that would undo U.S. gains in the region and give ISIS fighters a \"second lease on life.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nFOX News' Edmund DeMarche, Lucas Tomlinson and Jennifer Griffin contributed to this report.", "description": "The\u00a0White House announced late Sunday that Turkey will soon move forward with a planned military operation in\u00a0northeast Syria, as U.S. troops began\u00a0pulling back from their positions.", "authors": ["Evie Fordham"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Erdogan-Trump-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
