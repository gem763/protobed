The \u201cshock therapy\u201d delivered to Russia midwifed Putinism instead of a prosperous American ally. The war in Iraq ushered in a regional conflict that\u2019s still burning to this day. Chimerica worked out better for the Chinese than for many working-class Americans, and far better for the Chinese Politburo than for the cause of liberty. And the self-justifying doctrine of the present elite \u2014 that you can serve the common good while in office and do well for yourself afterward \u2014 became far more implausible when the elite\u2019s projects kept failing even as the officeholders kept on cashing in\u2026\n\nIn this sense the strongest defense of Trump\u2019s possibly impeachable conduct vis-\u00e0-vis Hunter Biden and his father isn\u2019t some sort of careful \u201cno quid pro quo!\u201d parsing of the president\u2019s words. It\u2019s the more straightforward argument that, as Dan McCarthy wrote for The National Interest over the weekend, this was what Trump was elected to do \u2014 to \u201cuse all legal means at his disposal to strike at business-as-usual among the political elite,\u201d even if that requires trampling over norms that would normally prevent a U.S. president from encouraging a foreign investigation into his rival and his rival\u2019s family.\n\nBut this defense requires believing that a kind of \u201cthe worse, the better\u201d response to elite malfeasance will somehow bring us back to a less corrupt equilibrium. Trump was indeed, as McCarthy wrote, \u201celected on his own kind of anti-corruption manifesto.\u201d But there is nothing of republican austerity or Catonian civic virtue in how he has actually governed. Instead, the tone was set, well, by his entire pre-presidential career, but let\u2019s say especially by his campaign-season hiring of Manafort, a statement that in place of elite self-enrichment through New World Order synergies, Trump was offering corruption without varnish, self-dealing without ideological self-justification.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ross Douthat", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Corruption-Democracy-Trump.Html"], "top_image": ""}
