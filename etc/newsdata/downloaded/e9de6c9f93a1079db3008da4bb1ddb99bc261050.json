But the gap narrowed, leaving his Socialist party (PS) stronger than in the 2015 election but still needing allies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear from this election that the PS is reinforced and the allied parties consolidated their positions,\u201d Costa, smiling broadly, told supporters chanting: \u201cVictory! Victory\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince we don\u2019t have a majority alone, we have to find solutions that guarantee stability for the next four years,\u201d he said.\n\nCosta said voters liked the 2015 deal that saw the Left Bloc and the Communists unexpectedly back his Socialists to sideline the right, and that he wanted it to continue, adding that he also meant to negotiate with the upstart People-Animals-Nature\n\n(PAN) party.\n\nWith most of the votes counted, the Socialists led with 106 seats. That put them in first place, but with only four seats still not accounted for, they cannot reach the full majority of 116 seats in the 230-seat assembly.\n\nThe Socialists substantially increased their score from their 86 lawmakers in 2015.\n\nCosta\u2019s minority government has received praise from Brussels and at home for combining fiscal discipline with measures to promote growth after recession and the austerity of Portugal\u2019s 2010-14 debt crisis.\n\nHe told supporters he would continue to cut the budget deficit and the debt. But that could be complicated by his potential allies\u2019 demands.\n\n\u201cThese negotiations could be more complex than four years ago when the pact on the left was cemented by their common goal to unseat the right,\u201d said political scientist Antonio Costa Pinto.\n\n\u201cNow the left as a whole has been reinforced. ... Obviously they will test the budgetary limits and the economic projections for the next few years,\u201d Costa Pinto said, expecting the negotiations to take a few weeks, now with more participants.\n\nPresident Marcelo Rebelo de Souza is likely to demand assurances from the parties that the solution would be a lasting one.\n\nNegotiations are in any case not expected to be as messy or as long as in neighbouring Spain, which still has no government more than five months after elections and is heading for a repeat vote in November.\n\nIn 2015, it took less than two months for Costa to reach a deal with leftist allies and be sworn in as prime minister.\n\nPortugal's Prime Minister and Socialist Party (PS) candidate Antonio Costa reacts after preliminary results in the general election in Lisbon, Portugal, October 7, 2019.

But those seats are not enough for the Socialists to govern with them alone.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very good result. I still wish it was more, because the country needs to move quickly to tackle the climate emergency,\u201d PAN supporter Paulo Santos, 43, said at the party\u2019s evening rally.\n\nThe far-right Chega elected one lawmaker - the first time a far-right party got a seat in Portugal\u2019s parliament since the end of the dictatorship in 1974.
