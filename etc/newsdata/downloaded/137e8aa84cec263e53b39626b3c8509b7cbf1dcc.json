The image on the left shows the one that Pedro Goss came across in the South African wild\n\nFor Pedro, who was visiting family in Lesotho, it's an encounter he won't soon forget.\n\n'Being from London it was a great opportunity for me to see other forms of wildlife than the common English pigeon, a seagull nibbling a chip or a rat on the underground,' he said.", "description": "Pedro Goss, 18, was visiting Royal Natal National Park in South Africa when he spotted the mysterious creature moving at high speed across the ground at a strange angle.", "authors": ["Michael Havis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/12/19579070-0-image-a-13_1570792861557.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
