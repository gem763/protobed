This doesn\u2019t happen so much these days, but I can remember chefs in vertiginous hats arriving at my table as if they were recreating a papal visit.\n\nMy solution is to make myself a cup of tea at the coffee machine: this allows me to have a casual look around the restaurant without making a fuss.\n\nQuite recently, I was doing this when I overheard a large table nearby who were having a look at the pudding menu and discussing their options. When seeing a dish featured salted caramel, an older lady rejected it because she didn\u2019t like salt in her puddings.\n\nI realise that I should get angry that one of my creations was being rejected for such a trivial reason, but actually I had a lot of sympathy for her. In fact, I had the same feeling for a long time \u2013 why add salt to a sweet dish when you have been eating savoury food for the past hour?\n\nIt was working on this recipe a number of years ago that changed my mind. I had been trying to devise a cold chocolate dish that had a lovely slippery texture, rather like a just-set chocolate milk, and an intense taste.\n\nWhen they are dreaming up recipes, chefs are always looking for ways of intensifying or exaggerating the taste of things so that they make more of an impact on the person tasting the dish. There are many different ways of achieving this. For example, when making a sauce, it is normal to reduce the liquid by rapid boiling. The water evaporates faster than the fats and other flavour-packed elements in the sauce, and so the taste becomes concentrated.\n\nAnother way to exaggerate a dish\u2019s taste is to add highlights of the flavour profile of the main ingredient. For example, I add sugar, rose, lime and sesame oil to strawberry ice cream because I detect these elements in my perfect strawberry, and these help the strawberry taste to fight through the cream and the cold.", "description": "While I like to go out into the restaurant from time to time during service, I really dislike it when a chef parades around his or her tables in an effort to extort praise.", "authors": ["Stephen Harris", "Chef", "Owner Of The Sportsman"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/food-and-drink/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000145121012-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqjEMr0nreRlcBJEY5vrKtb7yksnlSg0O-koynGbonfic.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
