But due to efforts to curb air pollution, the pyrotechnics epicentre is fizzling out.\n\nIn addition to gifts, elaborate feasts and family get-togethers, the Hindu mega-festival of lights, which falls this weekend, has in recent years also meant setting off firecrackers \u2014 millions of them.\n\nTheir smoke combines with other emissions to turn the air of India\u2019s cities \u2014 among the world\u2019s most polluted \u2014 into a deadly, sickly yellow cocktail that one study says kills a million Indians prematurely every year.\n\nJust before Diwali last year, India\u2019s top court ruled only \u201cgreen crackers\u201d that emit fewer pollutants could be used.\n\nBut although the police tried to enforce the new rules, most people set off the old type regardless.\n\nConfusion still surrounds the regulations, but signs in Sivakasi district, which in past years supplied 90-95 percent of India\u2019s firecrackers with revenues of around $800 million, suggest the 2019 blowout will be quieter.\n\n\u201cUsually after Diwali the people come to us and place orders for the next Diwali and even give some advance payment,\u201d said D Mathan, director of Lima Fireworks \u2014 one of around 1,000 manufacturers in Sivakasi.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen this time around,\u201d he told AFP. Production at his company has plunged almost 60 percent.\n\nThe industry is the biggest local job creator, directly or indirectly employing hundreds of thousands of people, many of them uneducated women, churning out boxes of crackers with names like \u201cNapoleon Total War\u201d.\n\nNow many don\u2019t know what they will do.\n\n\u201cSome people migrated to other jobs like daily wage labourers, farm labourers and construction workers,\u201d Arvind Kumar, a factory employee in the district in Tamil Nadu state, told AFP.\n\nMany producers switched to manufacturing the \u201cgreen crackers\u201d after receiving training and assistance from the government. But being more expensive, sales have been slow.\n\nG Karuppasamy, 65, a Sivakasi firecracker shopkeeper and wholesaler, told AFP that sales have slumped almost 50 percent as orders from around India have dried up.\n\n\u201cAuthorities talk about pollution but we don\u2019t pollute much compared to others. And one day doesn\u2019t make a difference for the rest of the year,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe government shouldn\u2019t clamp down on us. Everyone in a 30-kilometre (20-mile) radius is dependent on this sector. Sivakasi\u2019s existence isn\u2019t possible without this sector,\u201d he added.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "With thousands of workers painstakingly handmaking vast volumes of firecrackers, Sivakasi in southern India is usually at full tilt before Diwali", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/firecracker.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
