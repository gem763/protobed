We are not going to let him whip out with his sell-out deal.\n\n\u2018We will say no to him again and again. Whatever deal he brings must go back to the people.\u2019\n\nMP Antoinette Sandbach, who had the Conservative whip removed, credited the crowd with \u2018changing her mind\u2019 on a second vote.\n\nShe said: \u2018My local party voted no confidence in me for resisting no deal.\n\nIt has been a bad day for Boris Johnson, but a good day for these people (Picture: REX)\n\nProtesters are demanding a second EU referendum (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s undemocratic and not what people voted for, but it\u2019s honourable that I put my job on the line to protect tens of thousands of jobs that will be lost in the north west from no-deal Brexit.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, pro-Brexit activists also gathered in Westminster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Hurt, 48, from Sheffield, was sporting a \u2018I voted Leave\u2019 T-shirt, and said he feels people who voted for Brexit are being ignored.\n\nHe added: \u2018I voted Leave, I want my voice heard.\n\n\u2018It is always about the Remainers, never about the Leavers. There are 17.4 million of us, we never get our voices heard.\u2019\n\nWhen they learned Johnson had lost a key commons vote on his Withdrawal Agreement, thousands of people cheered in the streets as if a goal had been scored.\n\nThe commons voted to postpone Johnson\u2019s deal, binding him by law to ask for an EU extension (Picture: AP)\n\nShadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry speaks on stage at Parliament Square (Picture: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe approved amendment by expelled Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin means the deal has to be withheld until all appropriate legislation has been put in place.\n\nUnder the Benn Act, passed by Parliament last month, which makes an no-deal Brexit illegal, Johnson will now be bound by law to the EU for an extension until January 31.\n\nThis is because he failed to get his deal passed by Parliament by today, but the Prime Minister says he will not negotiate a new deadline, telling MPs \u2018the law does not compel me to\u2019.\n\nDetermined to get the UK out of the European Union by Halloween, he vowed to introduce the legislation needed to implement his deal next week.\n\nEarlier reports said this would be on Tuesday but Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg told MPs it would be on Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
