Meanwhile, the U.S. agreed to delay an increase on tariffs previously scheduled to take effect Oct. 15, but stopped short of calling off a tariff hike previously set for December.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Wednesday\u2019s retail sales report will be a focal point that provides a pulse on the health of one of the biggest pieces of the U.S. economy \u2013 the consumer. It comes after recent data on manufacturing and services-sector activity from the Institute of Supply Management deteriorated to multi-year lows, with each survey pointing to trade-related concerns as an underlying cause of their woes.\n\n\u201cAt a time when most economic discussions have been dominated by recession risks, the U.S. consumer is one facet that has continued to perform. Consumer confidence remains elevated but have moderated recently, while concern over the impact of tariffs has been spontaneously mentioned by consumers in recent surveys,\u201d Wells Fargo economists wrote in a note last week.\n\n\u201cWhile households certainly have the means to spend, our concern of late lies more in their continued willingness to do so,\u201d the bank added.\n\nBut an upside surprise in September\u2019s retail data may quell fears that weakness in the U.S. manufacturing sector has spilled over into consumer spending, the economists added. Consumer spending drives about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.\n\nHeadline sales are expected to have advanced 0.3% in September, marking a slight deceleration from August\u2019s 0.4% increase, according to a Bloomberg consensus forecast. Excluding the more volatile categories of auto and gas sales, retail sales are also anticipated to have risen 0.3% for the month, or greater than the 0.1% rise logged in August.\n\nItems for sale are displayed inside of a Primark store in the Brooklyn borough of New York, U.S. September 20, 2019.

Wall Street expects to see a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 1.320 million housing starts in September, down 3.2% from August\u2019s SAAR of 1.364 million.\n\n\u201cLong-term mortgage rates remained low in early October and were likely supportive for consumer housing demand,\u201d Nomura Instinet economist Lewis Alexander wrote in a note last week.\n\nQ3 earnings season ramps up\n\nMajor banks\u2019 and financial institutions\u2019 quarterly reports this week will serve as the de facto start to third-quarter earnings season. Some of those include J.P.Morgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) \u2013 the four largest U.S. banks by assets \u2013 along with other \u201cbulge bracket\u201d investment banks including Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS).\n\nBank profitability has come under pressure this year in a lower interest rate environment, with two Fed rate cuts already executed this year, and at least one more expected by market participants by the end of the year. A flattening, and at times inverted, Treasury yield curve has also crimped banks\u2019 ability to profit on long-term loans.", "description": "The coming week\u2019s docket of economic reports and earnings releases comes just following the Trump administration\u2019s announcement of a partial trade deal with China late last week.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e4JYJa6KZH3NDoxNuB9cmw--~B/aD00MzQyO3c9NjUxNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/0119ed70-ed4a-11e9-9d7e-474f28b6bc98", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
