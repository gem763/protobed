Some are quoted in state-run newspapers.\n\n\u201cMany beg the pedestrians not to erase their announcements from the wall since they are desperate and need the money urgently,\u201d says the council report, entitled \u201cSelling Body Parts: A Tragedy in Iran.\u201d \u201cThe sellers usually prefer to contact the prospective candidate directly to avoid giving a commission to the middlemen.\u201d\n\nThe price list: kidney, up to $10,000; liver, up to $50,000; and a cornea $20,000.\n\nShahin Gobadi, a national council spokesman, provided The Times with state-run news agency reports of Iranians willing to give up a cornea to survive financially.\n\nThe Albania-based council, which relies on a network of spies as well as Internet searches, says about 3,800 kidney transplants are performed each year in Iran. Of those, about 3,000 are products of a vibrant organ market.\n\n\u201cThe kidney and liver markets are hot for brokers. Instagram and Telegram apps are among their preferred platforms,\u201d the council report says. \u201cThe middlemen have also set up websites where they ask sellers to sign up and leave their details for buyers to find. Both sides pay the broker\u2019s commission.\u201d\n\nThe council provided no comparative organ sales numbers from previous years, but said that its research shows an increase in social media postings as the economy worsens.\n\nThe council\u2019s report provided recent notices on a kidney sales web site:\n\n\u201cOmid: Selling healthy kidney, resident of Sannandaj [west Iran], blood type: O- Phone:\u201d\n\n\u201cRouzbeh: Male, 26 years old, willing to sell a kidney due to financial problems. Blood type: O+. Price: 600 million rials [$5300]. Phone:\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition to functioning through the Internet, brokers often wander around major hospitals and approach relatives of patients who need a transplant in order to assess their financial status and make an offer an offer,\u201d the national council said. \u201cBrokers often take a 50 percent commission on resulting sales.\u2019\n\nThe council quoted a health commission member: \u201cBased on Sharia, organ transplant is not a problem and is permissible, and his holiness Imam [Khomeini] gave the authorization for and the grand clerics are not opposed to it.\u201d\n\nThe report\u2019s figures come from 2018, three years after the 2015 U.S.-Europe-Iran nuclear deal which freed up billions of dollars in trapped Iranian funds.\n\nThe infusion was supposed to supply capital to expand a state-dominated economy. But by 2018, nationwide protests erupted against what citizens said was a corrupt Islamic regime\u2019s hoarding huge amounts of cash and squandering resources on wars in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen.\n\nMr. Gobadi told The Washington Times: \u201cThe point is that through embezzlement, theft and astronomical pillaging of these resources, the Iranian regime\u2019s leaders have devoted most of these resources to suppression at home and export of terrorism as well as financing terrorist groups, fomenting proxy wars in the Middle East and working to obtain weapons of mass destruction.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump broke with the Barack Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions in August 2018. The president imposed more sanctions this week as punishment for the missile strike on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil complexes.\n\nA World Bank report in April said it expects Iran\u2019s economy to contract this year and next, while suffering through \u201cstagflation\u201d\u2013\u2013no growth and high inflation\u2013\u2013with the government running up record deficits.\n\nAyatollah Khomeini founded the Islamic Republican of Iran in 1979.\n\nThe report also quoted a local news story:\n\n\u201cAmir, who is about 18 years old, has auctioned his kidneys due to poverty. He doesn\u2019t want more than 500 million Rials. [5,000 dollars]. He says he can no longer cope with the landlord\u2019s complaints. He and his brother have each decided to sell one of their kidneys and buy a small house with the help of a loan to relieve their mother of the suffering of not having a home.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
