Bush Event", "language": "en", "text": "Student reporters at Chapman University refused to cover a campus event featuring former President George W. Bush after they were told by the university and Bush\u2019s team that their reporting would have to be reviewed prior to publication.\n\nAccording to a report by the Orange County Register, student reporters at Chapman University turned down an opportunity to sit in on a campus event featuring former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe students were told that they would only be permitted to publish a report on the event if it had been first approved by the former president\u2019s team. Additionally, the students would not be permitted to take photos or videos at the event. As a form of protest over the restrictions, the student journalists refused to attend the event.\n\nIn an editorial column, the student newspaper board argued that the policy was \u201cunethical\u201d and contradictory to America\u2019s \u201cfree press\u201d values.\n\nWords cannot begin to describe how unethical this is. It goes against everything we swear to uphold. Free press means it comes directly from the hands of journalists to the eyes of the readers. It doesn\u2019t go through a third-party PR source that modifies it to comply with their demands. It goes straight to the people. That\u2019s what free press is all about. That\u2019s why cases such as New York Times Co. v. United States exist. To ensure that newspapers aren\u2019t restricted by prior restraint. Because, in a way, that\u2019s censorship.\n\nChapman spokeswoman Jamie Ceman defended the restrictions, arguing that the students were invited to attend the event as guests rather than as reporters.\n\n\u201cThe Bush organization agreed to let The Panther students attend the event as guests, not as press, so they could experience the evening,\u201d Ceman said. \u201cBeing that they would not have been there as members of the press, it was a Chapman University decision to hold them to the same standard we held ourselves, and we asked that they comply with our agreement to share any content prior to publishing.\u201d", "description": "Student reporters at Chapman University refused to cover a campus event featuring former President George W.
