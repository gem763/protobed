Customers often prefer extra hot when selecting their heat preference.\n\nOrders spike around exam times, or celebratory occasions like Valentine's Day, sport events and graduations, amongst others, the survey found.\n\nSouth Africans are also generous, according to the report. Customers often request that parts of their orders like chips, coffee and rolls be given to the delivery-partners on pick up, so drivers can enjoy while it\u2019s still warm.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "They are also generous and don't mind sharing with the delivery men.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8921/abef36d2b7884a1c838bfc9d53397c9f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
