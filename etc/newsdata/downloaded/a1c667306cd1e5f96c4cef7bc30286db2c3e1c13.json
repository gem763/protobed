I\u2019ve done esteemable things and things that have been in my life that I regret. Every single one of those things has brought me exactly to where I am right now, which is probably the best place I\u2019ve ever been in my life. I\u2019ve gone through my own struggles.\n\nROBACH: : \u2014In and out of rehab seven, eight times\u2014\n\nBIDEN: \u2014Say it nicer to me. Sought treatment for an issue, like most people. So insensitive.\n\nROBACH: I\u2019m so sorry. But I think this is a human question. Do you worry that all of this noise, even though it\u2019s just noise, that it could affect your sobriety?\n\nBIDEN: Of course. Look, you don\u2019t want to live in the worry of it because then you\u2019re feeding the beast. I have no answer, other than this: You\u2019ve got to live in the connections that you have to healthy things and I have so many of them. I have to live there, instead of living in fear like \u201cOh my god, the stress is going to make me drink or the stress is going to make me use.\u201d", "description": "Hunter Biden accused an ABC News interviewer of being \"so insentisive\" of his previous stints in rehab for substance abuse.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/hunter-biden-abc-interview-glass-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
