Study results showed that patients working with the program were more than twice as likely to abstain from alcohol, cocaine, marijuana and stimulants, compared with those who didn\u2019t. A year later, the company\u2019s reSET-O program was approved specifically for patients being treated for opioid addiction.\n\nPear CEO Corey McCann spoke with The Associated Press about the company\u2019s technology. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nQ: Pear sells the first software programs that require a doctor\u2019s prescription. What happens after a patient downloads a product like reSET?\n\nA: The prescription unlocks the product for 12 weeks of continuous access. And during that 12 weeks, I interact with the products to report my cravings and triggers. All of that goes to my physician and really helps to reinforce the physician-patient interaction. I also complete a set of modules of what\u2019s called community reinforcement approach, which is a very specific type of neuro-behavioral intervention for addiction. I complete four of those modules per week so that\u2019s about 30 minutes of engagement. As I\u2019m completing those modules I receive rewards that incentivize me to continue participating with the software.\n\nQ: Many of us have experienced the addictive nature of apps like Facebook or Twitter. Is this technology similar to that?\n\nA: It\u2019s well known that addicted patients respond very favorably to what are called variable reward schedules. So our program is a highly engaging mechanism for patients with substance use and opioid use disorder. What we\u2019re finding is that all of these different patient populations interact with technology and are engaged in entirely specific ways. What technology has done prior to Pear is to look at the way that healthy, normal people like you and I presumably interact with technology.\n\nQ: So how are these patients different?\n\nA: I guess in layman\u2019s terms, if you\u2019ve ever been to a casino and seen someone playing a slot machine, smoking a cigarette and drinking a martini - there\u2019s an old adage that \u201cit\u2019s all dopamine.\u201d What happens when you look at these patients\u2019 brains is they\u2019re really just swimming in dopamine.\n\nQ: What are the actual rewards or perks that patients get from these apps?\n\nA: Patients receive everything from badges and digital \u201cat-a-boys\u201d to things like gift cards for Starbucks and things of nominal financial value which can\u2019t be exchanged for substances of abuse. And each of the patients interacts with these different reward schedules in different ways. A good deal of the novelty is in pairing up the right patient with the right reward corresponding to the right amount.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Smartphone apps have transformed the way we read the news, hail rides and connect with friends and family.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matthew Perrone"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/insider_qa-pear_therapeutics_44313_c0-210-5011-3131_s1770x1032.jpg?c60e74d0c1e61e3642a28152ad7dbb04d3e6ca38", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
