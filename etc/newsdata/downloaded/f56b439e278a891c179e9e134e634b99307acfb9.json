USA TODAY\n\nDetroit Lions defensive end Trey Flowers committed two costly and controversial penalties in the fourth quarter of the Detroit Lions' 23-22 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Monday Night Football.\n\nBefore he gets an apology from the NFL or the referees for the two hands-to-the-face calls, though, he has a much better chance of receiving a \"thanks\" from the Packers instead.\n\nGreen Bay outside linebacker Preston Smith told reporters after the game that all that matters in his mind is Green Bay walking out of Lambeau with the win. But he may find time this week to thank Flowers for the seemingly phantom penalties.\n\n\u201cMan, I don\u2019t care what\u2019s going on with these (other) teams, we\u2019re 5-1,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s the penalties they got. We didn\u2019t lose, we\u2019re 5-1. I might just say thank you.\n\n\u201cI know Trey personally. I might text him, \u2018Thank you, appreciate you for the hands to the face.\u2019 I might hit him up. But man, I don\u2019t care about that call. It wasn\u2019t against our team and it helped our team. I\u2019m all for winning.
