REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n\nThe government, closely allied to centrist President Emmanuel Macron, is walking a political tightrope because it is under pressure too from its own supporters who opposed any measures they view as pandering to the far-right.\n\nSetting out the government\u2019s position in a parliamentary hearing on immigration, Philippe said it was important to act with humanity towards migrants.\n\nBut he said: \u201cThe question of being steered by targets for admissions for residency is not a taboo. I\u2019m not afraid of thinking about the idea of quotas.\u201d\n\nPhilippe also said there would be a review of the system for providing free medical care to immigrants who do not have official status in France - a system that critics say is open to exploitation by illegal migrants.\n\n\u201cFrance should take care of all those who live on its territory. But it should be neither more, nor less, attractive than its neighbours,\u201d he said.\n\nFrance last year recorded 123,000 asylum requests, an increase of 22% on the previous year.\n\nMacron\u2019s government, while trying to navigate a middle course on immigration, has come under fire from both right and left.\n\nSpeaking last week, Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally, said the government was undermining national security by letting people with violent Islamist tendencies into the country.\n\n\u201cThe government worsens a deadly danger every day, with its senseless immigration policy. The state is absent, dramatically absent, criminally absent.\u201d\n\nIn the debate on Monday, Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the leftist France Unbowed party, said in remarks directed at the government: \u201cYou want to make the immigrant, once again, into a scapegoat, rather than the financier who pillages our wealth through fraud and tax evasion.\u201d", "description": "French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Monday he was not opposed to introducing quotas for migrants, part of an effort by his government to heed voters' concerns about immigration that are being seized upon by far-right political rivals.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438147125&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961CY", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
