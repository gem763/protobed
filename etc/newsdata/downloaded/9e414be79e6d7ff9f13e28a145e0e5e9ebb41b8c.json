Photo: courtesy of the retailers\n\nYou may have noticed some posts from our friends at the Strategist on the Cut. They\u2019ll be dropping in every now and again, sharing their expertise on the basics you don\u2019t have time to research and the weird and wonderful things you don\u2019t yet know you need.\n\nThis week\u2019s dive into the best of the best of the internet\u2019s sales features a ton of autumnal goodies, like some houndstooth loafers for under $50, a potentially-not-supposed-to-be-on-sale sweater, and a puffer that feels like wearing a sleeping bag.\n\nLululemon Wanderer Jogger $89 (was $118, now 25% off) We love a Lululemon pant that\u2019s some cross between a pair of pajamas, gym gear, and work slacks. These sweat-wicking Wanderer Joggers, available in green and navy as well as black, are supposedly also ideal for \u201cflights, drives, or relaxed afternoons.\u201d $89 at Lululemon Buy\n\nLululemon Cross It Off Tote 20L $39 (was $58, now 33% off) Also from Lululemon: a super lightweight slouchy triangle-shaped tote bag that has a snap closure and interior zip pocket. $39 at Lululemon Buy\n\nMoDRN Scandinavian Finna Ladder Bookcase $237 (was $279, now 15% off) It almost looks like it could be from Hay. $237 at Walmart Buy\n\nIsabel Marant Etoile Arsy High-Rise Velvet Jeans $90 (was $280, now 68% off) Things in the Matches Fashion sale bin are an extra 20 percent off, which means that it might be time for some velvet pink high-waisted pants from Isabel Marant. $90 at Matches Fashion Buy with code: EXTRA20\n\nRaey Vintage Floral-Print Silk Slip Dress $109 (was $272, now 60% off) Wear this with a white T-shirt underneath when the weather gets a little cooler. $109 at Matches Fashion Buy with code: EXTRA20\n\nGanni Fenn Wool-Blend Boucl\u00e9 Jacket $124 (was $311, now 60% off) This Ganni jacket will actually get you excited about jacket season. $124 at Matches Fashion Buy with code: EXTRA20\n\nCult Gaia Cora Wooden-Beaded Bag $75 (was $158, now 53% off) A Cult Gaia bag that\u2019s actually kind of fall-appropriate. $75 at Matches Fashion Buy with code: EXTRA20\n\nHaight Heart V-Neck Wrap Crepe Midi Dress $98 (was $305, now 68% off) This millennial mustard midi dress is meant to wear over a bikini \u2026 but we don\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t wear it to work. $98 at Matches Fashion Buy with code: EXTRA20\n\nSir Marceau Tiered Polka-Dot Silk Dress $223 (was $558, now 60% off) If you have any fancy fall functions on the horizon. $223 at Matches Fashion Buy with code: EXTRA20\n\nSnow Peak Point-Collar Performance Jacket $150 (was $469, now 68% off) This men\u2019s Snow Peak jacket that we wrote about in last week\u2019s sales post is now an extra 20 percent off now. $150 at Matches Fashion Buy with code: EXTRA20\n\nChampion UO Exclusive Mixed Print Hoodie Sweatshirt $50 (was $75, now 33% off) There\u2019s a lot going on with this here sweatshirt, but it somehow works. $50 at Urban Outfitters Buy\n\nEverlane Modern Flannel Shirt $34 (was $68, now 50% off) This flannel shirt from Everlane was apparently made for \u201csupreme comfort.\u201d $34 at Everlane Buy\n\nMadewell Lorimer Backpack $159 (was $198, now 20% off) This 1990s-feeling backpack from Madewell also comes in brown. $159 at Madewell Buy\n\nEloquii V-Neck Contrast Stitching Dress $77 (was $110, now 30% off) It should be noted that this contrast-stitch dress from Eloquii runs a little big (so size down). $77 at Eloquii Buy\n\nKenneth Cole Reaction Men's Indy Sneaker $27 (was $80, now 66% off) Apparently there is an Amazon shoe outlet, and we found some treasures in there, including this men\u2019s boot-sneaker hybrid from Kenneth Cole. (Note: While the description says these are women\u2019s shoes, they are not!) $27 at Amazon Buy\n\nDream Pairs Women's Elatica Elastic Ankle Strap Flat Sandals Also in the outlet are sandals from Dream Pairs (makes of these sandals that often get confused for Margiela).
