But he said it's not a decision for the federal government alone; it requires partnerships and negotiations across provinces and territories.\n\nHe took sharp aim at Ontario Premier Doug Ford and his cuts to health care programs, billing himself as the best leader to stand tough against Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's provincial cousin through those negotiations.\n\n\"So the question becomes for Canadians, 'Who do you want negotiating with Doug Ford when it comes to your health?'\" he said.\n\nFord's office said this year's provincial budget increased health spending by $1.3 billion.\n\n\"He wants to change the channel from his situation he's facing and he's busy campaigning and that's fine. I'm busy governing and we're doing a great job turning this province around and putting money back into people's pockets and creating 230,000 jobs in the last year and four months,\" Ford told CBC News in Toronto.\n\n\"So he can continue doing that. I'm going to continue focusing on the province.\"\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford says he has increased funding for health care. (Cole Burston/The Canadian Press)\n\nA statement from Ford's press secretary Ivana Yelich said it's \"categorically untrue\" to say Ford's government is cutting health care and insisted that his government has made landmark investments in health care and mental health services.\n\n\"Premier Ford, along with his provincial and territorial counterparts, has asked the federal government to do its fair share to put patients first and strengthen our provincial health care systems across Canada by increasing the growth rate of the Canada Health Transfer to 5.2 per cent annually,\" she said.\n\n\"We look forward to working with the federal government to ensure Ontario gets a fair and adequate share of the funding to support our province's health care needs.\"\n\nScheer shot back that Trudeau would continue to run the country's finances as unpopular former Liberal premier of Ontario Kathleen Wynne did, and suggested that Trudeau is trying to deflect from his own record of big deficits and scandal.\n\n\"He's desperate to run against anyone other than me,\" he said during a campaign event in Vaughan, Ont.\n\nScheer said a Conservative government would increase transfers for health and education by three per cent and accused Trudeau of lying to Canadians about his party's positions.\n\nCouncil recommended universal pharmacare\n\nIn June, an advisory council appointed by the Liberal government recommended the establishment of a universal, single-payer public pharmacare system.\n\nThe council's 171-page report called for the creation of a new drug agency that would draft a national list of prescription medicines that would be covered by the taxpayer, beginning with an initial list of common and essential drugs, by Jan. 1, 2022.\n\nThe council recommended that the initial list be expanded to a comprehensive plan by Jan. 2, 2027. When fully implemented, the total cost would be about $15 billion a year, the council said.\n\nDr. Eric Hoskins, a former Ontario health minister and chair of the advisory council, acknowledged at the time there are \"significant incremental costs\" to building a pharmacare program, but he noted that those costs are already being picked up by Canadians.\n\nThe Liberal backgrounder released Monday with Trudeau's announcement says a re-elected Liberal government would also commit to establishing the Canada Drug Agency to make drug purchasing \"more effective and efficient,\" implement a national formulary with provinces, territories and other stakeholders to lower drug prices, and introduce a rare disease drug strategy to help Canadian families save money on high-cost drugs.\n\nDrug pricing changes on the way\n\nThe federal government is also making changes to the way it will evaluate new drug prices in a move to try to save Canadians billions of dollars over the next 10 years.\n\nIn August, the government released changes to the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, first set up in 1987 as a shield against high drug prices, which are set to kick in next July.\n\nUnder the new regulations, the board will no longer compare prices with the United States and Switzerland (which have some of the world's highest drug prices) when figuring out what companies are allowed to charge. It will still compare drug prices to France, Germany and Italy, and has added Japan, Spain, Norway, Australia, Belgium and the Netherlands to the list.\n\nThe Liberal health care platform also pledges to set clear standards for access to mental health services, and improve access to homecare and palliative care.\n\n\"Every Canadian, no matter where they live, who they are or what they do, should receive the care they need to stay healthy,\" Trudeau said.\n\nThe Liberal Party says these measures would represent a $6 billion federal investment \u2014 what it calls an \"additional down payment\" \u2014 with details related to costing to be released \"over the course of the campaign.\"\n\nThe Liberal Party has been criticized for not having every platform promise costed and publicly released by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, as the Conservative Party and NDP have done.\n\nIf elected, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says he would bring in a universal pharmacare system within one year. (Isaac Olson/CBC)\n\nToday, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the current system, which can diagnose a patient without offering subsidized medication, is \"illogical\" and \"irrational.\" He said an NDP government would bring in a universal pharmacare program within just one year.\n\n\"We've got the courage to take on big pharma. We've got the courage to take on the big insurance companies that don't want this program. But we know it's doable and it's so important,\" he said.\n\nWhile Trudeau appeared to hedge on the exact model of pharmacare that would ultimately be adopted, Linda Silas, president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions, took from the announcement that Liberals would bring in a universal program, rather than a limited one. She said access to prescription medication should be guaranteed, just like access to hospitals and doctors.\n\n\"As nurses, we've been advocating for universal pharmacare for decades, because we see first-hand how our patients are suffering and how our system is squandering precious resources that could be reinvested in home care, long-term care, primary care, mental health and acute care,\" said Silas in a statement.\n\n\"Study after study has confirmed universal drug coverage is the most efficient, economical and equitable option for Canada.\"", "description": "The Liberals are promising to ensure all Canadians have access to a family doctor, mental health services and prescription drugs, but have released few details about how a re-elected Liberal government\u00a0would implement a national pharmacare program or how much it would cost.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5294060.1569257505!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-liberal-20190923.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
