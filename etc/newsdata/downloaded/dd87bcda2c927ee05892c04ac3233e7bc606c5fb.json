But the flare-up in unrest indicates Abiy might be losing support among his own powerbase.\n\nProtesters outside Jawar\u2019s house on Thursday morning chanted: \u201cWe don\u2019t want Abiy, we don\u2019t want Abiy\u201d.\n\nThe demonstrations began on Tuesday after police surrounded Jawar\u2019s house. Protests quickly spread to other parts of the capital and to the cities of Adama, Ambo, Harar and Jimma, residents said.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of violence on Wednesday, Jawar supporters erected tents outside his house on Thursday and brought matresses, signaling they intended to stay there.\n\n\u201cOne week, one month, we don\u2019t care, we will stay here until the government tells us why they did this to Jawar,\u201d said a young protester, who asked for anonymity for fear of repercussion from the security forces.\n\nHalf a dozen policemen stood outside Jawar\u2019s house at a distance from the protesters.\n\nPROTESTS TURN VIOLENT\n\nThree people were killed during the clashes between police and protesters on Wednesday, a regional official in eastern Harar city told Reuters. Two were shot by the police, the official said, and a third person was killed by protesters because they suspected him of leaking information to security officials.\n\n\u201cToday the city is calm this morning but the road to Addis Ababa is closed by the young men,\u201d the official said.\n\nA businessman in Addis Ababa told Reuters two dead protesters were brought to Alert Hospital after clashes between protesters and security forces in the capital.\n\nSeveral roads heading out of Addis Ababa remained closed.\n\nJawar, an Ethiopian-born U.S. citizen, mobilized many thousands of young men all over the Oromiya region to protest against the government from 2016 to 2018, building pressure that led to the resignation of Abiy\u2019s predecessor Hailemariam Desalegn and Abiy\u2019s appointment.\n\nThough Jawar and Abiy were photographed together frequently last year, remarks by the prime minister on Tuesday suggested frustration with media entrepreneurs like Jawar who are seen to be promoting ethnic agendas ahead of Ethiopian unity.\n\nOn Tuesday, Abiy said in a speech to parliament, without naming anyone: \u201cThose media owners who don\u2019t have Ethiopian passports are playing both ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe tried to be patient. But if this is going to undermine the peace and existence of Ethiopia...we will take measures. You can\u2019t play both ways,\u201d he said.\n\nAbiy must walk a delicate line between increasing political freedoms and reining in strongmen building ethnic powerbases by demanding more access to land, power and resources for their groups.\n\nSome Ethiopians have criticized Jawar for using ethnically tinged language, but many young Oromo men consider him a hero.", "description": "Hundreds of supporters of prominent Ethiopian activist Jawar Mohammed set up camp around his house in Addis Ababa on Thursday one day after police fired gunshots and teargas to break up demonstrations against his treatment by the government.", "authors": ["Tiksa Negeri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
