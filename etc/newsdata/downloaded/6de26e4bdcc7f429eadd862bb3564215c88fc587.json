That's in part because the company sold 455 LEAP engines during the quarter, 50% more than a year earlier.\n\n\"As we think about 2020, I think we're going to try to follow Boeing's lead here,\" CEO Larry Culp said. \"When we talk about the full-year cash headwinds this year due to Max that obviously assumes that we don't see a return to service this year.\"\n\nGE's current forecast is \"a conservative financial planning assumption,\" Culp added.", "description": "GE makes the LEAP engines used for the 737 Max, which has been grounded worldwide following two deadly crashes in the past year.", "authors": ["Michael Sheetz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104471157-RTS16DYD.jpg?v=1529452289", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
