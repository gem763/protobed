I\u2019m not so sure | Emma Brockes", "language": "en", "text": "At the theatre on Saturday night, I watched Diana Nyad, the long-distance swimmer, ignite an audience for over an hour. She recounted her record-breaking 111-mile swim from Cuba to Florida at the age of 64 after several failed attempts, and in the face of killer sharks, deadly jellyfish and huge waves. It was like listening to a one-woman version of the Iliad, an almost too perfect literalisation of inspirational metaphor. The subtitle of the show was \u201cnever, ever give up\u201d, a well-worn sentiment that in Nyad\u2019s hands was made thrillingly new.\n\nWhat did Hillary Clinton mean it was 'gutsy' to stay with Bill? It's complicated | Jean Hannah Edelstein Read more\n\nAs it happens, the Clintons were in the audience at New York\u2019s Minetta Lane Theatre that night. Afterwards on the pavement with one eye on the SUV convoy, theatregoers joked that Nyad\u2019s words risked inspiring Hillary \u2013 God forbid \u2013 to have another crack at the White House. A few days later, Hillary and Chelsea appeared on the TV show Good Morning America to promote their book, The Book of Gutsy Women. To the question, \u201cWhat\u2019s the gutsiest thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d Hillary replied, \u201cAh, boy, I think the gutsiest thing I\u2019ve ever done \u2013 well, personally, make the decision to stay in my marriage.\u201d The bravest thing she\u2019d done in public was run for president, she said, and in both scenarios the trick was to \u201cjust get up every day and keep going\u201d.\n\nStaying in one\u2019s marriage is different to running for president, which is different to swimming 111 miles across the Gulf Stream \u2013 and I\u2019m not convinced that \u201ckeep going\u201d is the mantra for all of them. The mapping of motivational sports psychology on to every tricky situation in life \u2013 Get Brexit Done springs to mind \u2013 is a standard approach that in complex times seems increasingly unhelpful. It\u2019s good to puff oneself up and feel infused with power and purpose, but when being motivated is the aim, rather than the byproduct of an undertaking, it seems like a misguided application of that energy.\n\nIf it\u2019s a reflex branding issue, the oddest context to which it\u2019s applied is the personal. Perhaps for Hillary, staying in her marriage was the right thing to do. But spinning it as courageous relative to the cowardice of leaving seems like a pinched and self-punishing way to audit one\u2019s emotions. Cowardice and bravery are terms that, surely, have no place in this arena, if for no other reason than the need to preserve a single space in life safe from the win-or-lose framing device of Nike-ad type language.\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m just being defeatist: there\u2019s an extension of motivational psychology for that too. A whole body of literature exists giving us permission to launder our own shortcomings by reselling them back to us as strengths. It\u2019s OK to fail; it takes greater courage to admit to being wrong than to plough on down an erroneous path. I agree with all of these things, and yet framing them this way \u2013 as stealth virtues \u2013 triggers tired thoughts about the integrity of just giving up.\n\nIn the show on Saturday night, Nyad spoke of being molested as a teenager by her swimming coach. It was moving, and infuriating, the absolute predictability that this should have happened; that on top of everything else, there was that. The swimmer didn\u2019t spin it as anything other than fact. Not grist for a survival story, nor something she\u2019d overcome to become a better person. It was simply a traumatic event, plainly stated, in which the telling itself was the endurance. Truly, it was inspiring.\n\n\u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist", "description": "We can\u2019t solve all life\u2019s problems with a motivational mantra.
