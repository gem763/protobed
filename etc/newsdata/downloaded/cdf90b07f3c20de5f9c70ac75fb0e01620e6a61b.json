I want to talk to him. In fact, more than anyone else, this person should be here because maybe he could learn something,\u201d he continued, pausing for cheers in the audience. \u201cAnd that's the superintendent of Chicago police Eddie Johnson. He said the values of the people of Chicago are more important than anything President Trump would have to say.\u201d\n\nTrump denounced the snub as a \u201cvery insulting statement after all I've done for the police,\u201d beginning to rattle off statistics about gun violence in the city.\n\nHe also ripped Chicago's status as a sanctuary city, claiming that Johnson had denied more than 1,000 requests from immigration officials to detain immigrants in Cook County, which includes Chicago.\n\n\u201cEddie Johnson wants to talk about values?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo, people like Johnson put criminals and illegal aliens before the citizens of Chicago and those are his values and frankly, those values to me are a disgrace.\u201d\n\nHe went on to call Johnson and other Chicago officials\u2019 support of its sanctuary status as a \u201cbetrayal of their oath to the shield and a violation of his duty to serve and to protect the courageous police officers of Chicago,\u201d asserting, to continuing applause from the audience, that Chicago police deserve a leader who \u201chas their backs and knows what he is doing\u201d and \u201cwho sides with you, with the people of Chicago.\u201d\n\nBut even as he sought to highlight Chicago\u2019s high rates of crime, an unusually localized attack to be delivered to an audience of international law enforcement officials, he applauded a nationwide decline in violent crime, including murders, since he took office, which reversed two consecutive years of an uptick in violent crime, according to FBI data. According to the Chicago Tribune, shootings and violent crime have also decreased in Chicago. But Trump attacked Chicago\u2019s gun laws, often inaccurately held up as the strictest in the nation, casting doubt on their effectiveness.\n\n\u201cThat doesn't seem to be working too well, does it? A lot of you people know exactly what I mean,\u201d Trump contended of the city's gun restrictions. \u201cBut under Johnson's leadership, they certainly don't protect people.\u201d\n\nJohnson held a news conference Monday afternoon to refute Trump\u2019s attacks, beginning his comments by telling reporters: \u201cFacts matter.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged Trump\u2019s accuracy in hailing a nationwide decrease in violent crime over the last two years. But he contended, contrary to what the president indicated, that Chicago\u2019s crime reductions were a major driver of those figures. \u201cWe could\u2019ve easily continued to rise,\u201d Johnson said, asserting that \u201cthe national narrative that Chicago is a city on fire is just simply not true.\u201d\n\nJohnson defended his officers, telling reporters that he is \u201cexceptionally proud\u201d of the work his police force has been doing. He also professed his dedication to the city, saying that he'd \"poured my heart out\" for his hometown. Johnson also shamed the president for Trump's purported lack of faith in his cops, who he vowed would always be willing to stand up for the city of Chicago.\n\n\u201cToday, the same police officers the president criticized for their inability to protect this city spent all day protecting him,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he expressed an openness to working with Trump, an offer the president made at one point during his speech. \u201cIf he\u2019s truly ready to roll up his sleeves to partner with us, so are we, as long as that partnership reflects who we are as Chicagoans,\u201d he added, pointing out that his department already has received some federal resources.\n\nOther Illinois officials lambasted the president in response to the broadsides. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot blasted Trump\u2019s comments as \u201cinsulting, ignorant buffoonery\u201d writing on Twitter that she was not surprised to see him bring up personal gripes.\n\n\u201cLuckily, in this city, we know the truth and we will not let anyone \u2014 no matter how high the office \u2014 denigrate who we are as a people or our status as a welcoming city,\u201d she continued, mocking the impeachment inquiry awaiting Trump back home and urging him to \u201cgo back to D.C. and face his fate.\u201d\n\nLightfoot also defended Johnson and her city\u2019s police force, writing in a separate string of tweets in which she invoked his so-called zero tolerance immigration policy and challenged Trump\u2019s moral authority to advise the city on issues of law and order.\n\n\u201cIt is ironic that you have chosen to speak at a law enforcement conference after you have demonstrated zero respect for the rule of law and actively work to destabilize communities,\u201d she said.\n\nIllinois governor J.B. Pritzker implored more civility, telling reporters that Illinois \u201cis the Land of Lincoln and when you come to the state of Illinois you should respect all the people that live here in the state of Illinois.\"\n\nAfter airing his grievances with Chicago's police chief, Trump moved to recite the steps his administration had taken to bolster law enforcement, including, he said, stymieing violent attacks on police officers. Recounting the story of a Chicago officer in the audience who was ambushed while serving a warrant, Trump denounced \"an attack on law enforcement\" as an \"attack on all Americans.\"\n\nHe also used the occasion to take a victory lap after approving a raid over the weekend said to have killed the founder and leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Trump ripped former President Barack Obama for not having caught the Islamic militant sooner, despite previously downplaying Obama\u2019s role in the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden.\n\nObama deserves much less credit for the killing of Bin Laden. The praise goes to our brave military and intelligence officers. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2012\n\n\u201cHe should have been killed years ago \u2014 another president should have gotten him,\u201d Trump said Monday, claiming an unrivaled focus on the leader. \"But to me it was very important. I would say all the time, they would walk into my office, \u2018Sir, we killed this leader at a low level.\u2019 I said I never heard of him. I want al-Baghdadi. That's the only one I know now, I want al-Baghdadi, get him. And they got him.\u201d\n\nTrump, too, continued to brag about the decimation of ISIS\u2019 physical caliphate in Syria and Iraq, though military experts have warned that the recent withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria could allow the terrorist group to regain its strength.\n\n\u201cIt was once the physical size of the state of Ohio and had seven million people and growing big, big, big,\u201d Trump said of ISIS\u2019 grip in the region. \u201cAnd they had a problem \u2014 it started about two-and-a-half years ago,\u201d he said, apparently alluding to his inauguration and drawing laughs and cheers from the crowd.\n\n\u201cDuring my administration, I \u2014 we \u2014 all together destroyed the caliphate 100 percent. Remember, I got it down to 97 percent and I said let's go home and then those people started saying 100 percent,\u201d he told the audience, claiming, without providing evidence, that \u201cbefore me they didn't care.\u201d\n\nNow, Trump argued, \u201cthey said what about 100 percent? And we met some great generals. I learned a lot about generals. I met some good ones and I saw some bad ones. Some that didn't have what it takes and others that had more than anyone would have thought. It was supposed to take a year, maybe two years. I said to one of them, \u2018How long will it take?\u2019 \u2018I think we can do it in one week, sir.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump also used the official event to complain about the ongoing impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives, comparing the investigation into whether he abused his power to pressure a foreign government into investigating a political rival to the alleged staging of a hate crime against himself by actor Jussie Smollett earlier this year.\n\n\"It's a scam,\" Trump asserted. \"It is a real big scam just like the impeachment of your president is a scam.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3a/21/f4c64aa843a3922eb9b11a707508/191028-trump-chicago-newman.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
