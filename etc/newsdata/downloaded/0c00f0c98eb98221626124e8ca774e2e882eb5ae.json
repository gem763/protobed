He was in tears after the final whistle, yet the German remains hopeful there may be a happy ending for him at Anfield.\n\nNow in his second season on loan at Besiktas, Karius insists he has put the crushing disappointment of that night behind him - and pointed out that he was suffering from concussion when he made his mistakes.\n\nBesiktas' Loris Karius has not given up hope of returning to parent-club Liverpool next season\n\n'Will I play for Liverpool again? Of course it's an option and a good option to still be there,' he said. 'Maybe I'll play for them again, you never know. It's still far ahead. If it's not Liverpool, it will be another decent team, so I'm not worried about any scenario.\n\n'The Premier League is the best league so it is interesting of course. If you play in England you're always a bit more in the spotlight, but I'm at a good club now so we will see what happens at the end of the season.\n\n'I don't think about Kiev anymore, it's so long ago, nearly two seasons now.. There were so many circumstances. I had a bad injury and nobody was talking about it. People can say what they want, it doesn't really concern me anymore.\n\nThe German goalkeeper was distraught after Liverpool's 2018 Champions League final defeat\n\n'After I was assessed, we realised [about the concussion] but while the game is going on, you have too much adrenaline to realise.\n\n'I am happy Liverpool won the Champions League the following year, and they have a good chance again this year, so let's see where it takes them. I still speak to the goalkeeping coach and some of the players.'\n\nNine days after the Kiev Final, brain injury expert Dr Ross D Zafonte of Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, said it was likely Karius had suffered a concussion after he carried out a 'comprehensive examination' of the 26-year-old.\n\nThe 26-year-old watches the ball slip through his grasp as Real Madrid score a third in Kiev\n\nDespite Karius' optimism, it would take an improbable combination of events to put him in goal for Liverpool again. He is under contract until the end of next season, but Alisson is now the undisputed No 1, with Adrian arriving as his No 2 this summer.\n\nThe Spaniard has made 10 appearances this term as Alisson recovers from the calf injury he sustained in the win over Norwich in the opening game of the Premier League season.\n\n'Every goalkeeper would feel comfortable behind that defence but Adrian is doing a good job,' Karius said. 'He seems like a nice guy; I am happy he is getting game time.\n\nBanners of Karius modelling Besiktas kits embellish the face of the club shop in Istanbul\n\n'The defence has improved brilliantly over the last season and a bit and they rarely concede goals anymore. It was solid even back then but now it's on another level because the whole has team improved.\n\n'The longer people are together the better it works. They have been playing together quite a bit and with the potential they have it looks really promising.\n\n'I hope they can win the league. The season is so long but it's always good to have a good start and get some points ahead so it looks good. I can't see them losing a game.'", "description": "Karius was speaking to the British media for the first time since Real Madrid 's 3-1 win in Kiev, when he was responsible for the first and third goals on his last competitive appearance for Liverpool.", "authors": ["Tom Collomosse For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/00/19316474-0-image-a-7_1570231998346.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
