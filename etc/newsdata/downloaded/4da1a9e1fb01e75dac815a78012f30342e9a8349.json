Ocasio-Cortez to endorse Sanders for president MORE (D-N.Y.), soccer player Megan Rapinoe and teen climate activist Greta Thunberg have each made BBC\u2019s list of this year\u2019s 100 most inspiring and influential women.\n\nThe list, released on Wednesday, pays tribute to women across the world who have driven change. The question this year\u2019s list is centered around asks, \u201cWhat would the future look like if it were driven by women?\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOcasio-Cortez is listed under the \u201cLeadership\u201d category, which consists of 19 women out of the 100 chosen. Under the post designated to the congresswoman, the BBC notes the 29-year-old's feat earlier this year of becoming the youngest women in history to serve in Congress as well as her campaign against a 10-term incumbent Democrat that marked one of the biggest defeats in last year\u2019s primary season.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting for a future where no person is left behind,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told the BBC. \u201cWhen people want to stop talking about the issues that black women face, trans women face, immigrant women face, we've got to ask them, \u2018Why does that make you so uncomfortable?'\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it's not just about identity, this is about justice. Everyone deserves justice,\u201d she added.\n\nGreta Thunberg, the 16-year-old climate activist from Sweden who sparked demonstrations across the globe in the past year, is one of 14 women listed under the \u201cEarth\u201d category.\n\nThunberg, who captured international headlines last month after she railed against world leaders at the U.N. summit over their inaction on climate change, told the BBC that people \u201care facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people.\"\n\n\u201cAnd now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say.

Under her posting on the list, BBC notes the player\u2019s athletic accomplishments as well as her activism for gender pay equality in soccer and other social issues surrounding race and LGBTQ rights.\n\n\u201cIf everybody was as outraged about racism as those who suffer it, if everybody was as outraged about homophobia as LGBTQ players, if everybody was as outraged about the lack of equal pay as women, that would be the most inspiring thing for the future to me,\u201d she told the BBC.\n\nThe BBC said the list was was compile by its \"100 Women team,\" which \"drew up a shortlist based on names gathered by them and suggested by the BBC's network of World Service languages teams.\"\n\n\"We were looking for candidates who had made the headlines or influenced important stories over the past 12 months, as well as those who have inspiring stories to tell, achieved something significant or influenced their societies in ways that wouldn't necessarily make the news,\" the agency added.\n\nThe BBC said the pool of \"names was then assessed against this year's theme - the Female Future - and measured for regional representation and due impartiality, before the final 100 were chosen.\"", "description": "Rep.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thunberg_rapinoe_ocasio_cortez_getty.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
