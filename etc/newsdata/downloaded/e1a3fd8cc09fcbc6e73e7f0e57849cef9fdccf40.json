To another, a deal means buying the absolute perfect property at exactly the right price. To a third, a deal might mean getting a property at a fair price without having to endure a bidding war or deal with a drawn-out negotiation.\n\n\n\nIn each of these cases, these sorts of \u201cdeals\u201d can be found when buyers work with an agent to purchase what\u2019s known as a whisper listing, meaning a property that never hits the open market via the MLS, or Multiple Listing Service.\n\nMore: Rising Rents, Wary Buyers Means Now Might Be the Time to Buy an Investment Property\n\nThese off-market listings\u2014also known as pocket listings\u2014have always been around, but they\u2019re becoming more common, said James Harris, a director at the Los Angeles-based realty firm, The Agency, noting that up to 30% of his clients buy or sell inventory in this way.\n\n\n\n\u201cTimes are changing and the world economy is changing,\u201d he said, \u201cand today, people are trying to be more protective of their privacy than in years past.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut privacy isn\u2019t the only appeal of a whisper listing.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople have also realized that having something exclusive holds more value than having something public,\u201d Mr. Harris continued. Plus, there are benefits to sellers, like the ability to pinpoint an ideal price point without accruing days on market, or just testing the market\u2019s waters before going all in.\n\nMore: For a Safer Bet in a Tough Luxury Market, Consider the Penthouse\n\nThe same benefits of an off-market listing apply to other areas around the world with luxury real estate, specifically when buyers and sellers are in the public eye, and have an increased need for privacy, or when the market is incredibly tight, and a certain type of in-demand inventory is scarce. \u201cThe success of a whisper listing is often dependent on how scarce the product you\u2019re selling is,\u201d said Leonard Steinberg, the New York-based chief evangelist at Compass.\n\n\n\nHere is what both buyers and sellers need to know about how a whisper listing can work in their favor.\n\n\n\nFor Buyers: Every Home is a Potential Whisper Listing\n\n\n\nIn the past, whisper listings were really just in-the-know real estate agents sharing intel with each other about who might want to sell\u2014or be willing to sell\u2014even if they haven\u2019t yet listed their property.\n\n\n\nThat still happens, said Mr. Steinberg, noting that, \u201ca good agent knows all of the inventory in a market really well\u2014not just what\u2019s for sale, but everything that\u2019s out there\u2014for this reason.\u201d\n\nMore: Discounted Villa Enclaves Offer Smart Property Investment in Dubai\n\nWith 22 years in the business to his name, he understands all of the inventory that\u2019s out there, not just the 5% to 10% of inventory that listed \u201cfor sale\u201d at any given time, he said.\n\n\u201cI like to think that every property in the world is a potential whisper listing,\u201d he said, meaning that almost every owner is likely to sell if they\u2019re offered the right price. \u201cIf you come in, unsolicited, and offer someone with a $1 million home, $2 million, it\u2019s going to take a lot of energy for them to not entertain that.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is why it\u2019s so important for a buyer to work with a knowledgeable agent, he said.\n\n\n\nThis deep understanding of the market is how he recently connected a buyer with an off-market (and not for sale) property at 39 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan that ended up being their perfect fit, and something the previous owner was willing to part with for the right price.\n\nMore: Amid Political Changes, Buyers Would Be Wise to Consider Prime Central London\n\nBut then there are also newer ways for buyers to look for off-market listings.\n\n\n\nAt Compass, one of those ways is via the public \u201cComing Soon\u201d link on its website, which launched at this time last year. This pre-market service, which includes a price point, lists properties that are set to hit the open market in one week to several weeks, depending on the property\u2019s location, and gives buyers a \u201csneak peek\u201d at new inventory before it hits the MLS and all the aggregator websites, such as Redfin and Zillow, Mr. Steinberg said. In some cases, he said, this has resulted in pre-market phase sale.\n\n\n\nThere are other websites that only registered agents can use to see off-market listings, including the Top Agent Network website, the Chicago-based offMLS website, and The PLS, for Pocket Listing Service, which Mr. Harris co-founded with other members of The Agency\u2019s team in 2017.\n\n\n\nTwo years in, \u201cwe are thriving,\u201d Mr. Harris said of the broker-only service, noting that they have more than 17,500 licensed real estate agent members, and close to 2,500 active off-market listings, representing $10 billion worth of active inventory, priced from about $500,000 up to $85 million.\n\n\n\nWithin a few weeks, a revamped site with additional functionality will launch, Mr. Harris said, noting that the plan is to eventually require a for-profit membership structure, with incentives for agents that bring other colleagues in.\n\nFrom Penta: Christie\u2019s Offers Marilyn Monroe Photos and Camera Used in Photoshoot\n\nMr. Harris said the best way for a buyer to score an off-market deal of the \u201cbargain price\u201d variety is to have their agent look for listings with a lower-than-expected price, meaning a highly motivated seller behind it.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are sellers who don\u2019t want to underprice their listing on the MLS, where friends and neighbors might see it and think that they\u2019re desperate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they will put a super aggressive price off-market on The PLS to see if they can get rid of their property without everyone knowing their business.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor Sellers: A Testing Ground to Pinpoint the Perfect Price\n\n\n\nThe real benefit of the \u201cComing Soon\u201d feature on Compass\u2019s website and a listing on The PLS or other off-listing websites is for sellers to test the market specifically related to price point.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf I meet a seller today and they think their home is worth $5 million and I think it\u2019s worth $4 million,\u201d Mr. Harris said, \u201cthey can test their $5 million price on The PLS and see if they get any action.\u201d\n\nMore: Forget Perfectly Timing the Market and Focus on What You Can Do Instead\n\nIf they don\u2019t get much interest or schedule any showings, they can consider that feedback, and re-consider price before hitting the MLS.\n\n\n\nThe same can be true of any word-of-mouth listing, even if it isn\u2019t posted on one of these websites. If a broker shares a new listing with their colleagues, and they get feedback that the price point is ridiculous and way too high\u2014or alternatively, that the price seems too good to be true\u2014they can adjust.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing about the MLS is that it can be a seller\u2019s best friend or their worst nightmare,\u201d Mr. Harris said, noting that the \u201cbest friend\u201d aspect speaks to its massive reach, while the \u201cworst nightmare\u201d bit happens if someone incorrectly prices a property and starts accumulating days on market. \u201cThat can be extremely detrimental to the sales process,\u201d he said, \u201cas the longer you\u2019re on the market, the harder it becomes to sell a property.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Steinberg agreed. \u201cIn this market, properties listed above $5 million are selling far, far more slowly than they used to, and no one likes to accrue days on market,\u201d he said. \u201cKeeping a listing \u2018hush hush,\u2019 or semi \u2018hush hush\u2019\u2014or even getting it out there as the loudest secret on the planet, as long as you don\u2019t officially list it\u2014can have value.\u201d\n\nMore: Investors Can Still Capitalize as Demand Soars for \u2018Undervalued\u2019 Luxury Singapore Homes\n\nIn Most Cases, the Open Market is Still Best\n\n\n\nEven as whisper listings may be getting more common\u2014at least at first to test price points\u2014Mr. Steinberg said he still thinks the open market, where there is greater reach for a seller and an ability to connect with a global marketplace, is the best way to go.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe open market is traditionally the smarter way of exposing a property to the best audience,\u201d he said, and in turn, getting more offers and a higher price.\n\n\n\nFor buyers, too, purchasing from the open market means you\u2019re less likely to overpay, because you can see what the market dictates is fair and right.\n\n\n\n\u201cUsually when something is a whisper listing, you can expect to pay more for it,\u201d Mr. Steinberg said. \u201cWhen there\u2019s no competition, you just can never be certain you\u2019re paying the right price.\u201d\n\nClick for More In-Depth Analysis of Luxury Lifestyle News\ufeff\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Anne Machalinski"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-108881?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
