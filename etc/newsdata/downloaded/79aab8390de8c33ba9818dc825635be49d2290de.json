Where are the leaders of the EFF, the leaders of the DA, the leaders of the ANC and where is the president?\n\n\"All they can do is come out and condemn and condemn, sitting in their offices that are air-conditioned while we are here in the sun trying to make sure that the i\u2019s are dotted and the t\u2019s are crossed with regards to this case.\"\n\nMasango said the country's elected leaders should be on the ground, providing clear leadership and experiencing the aftermath of these crimes against children.\n\n\"It's really sickening to come here with one or two members from different organisations and having to come to court to hear that the cases are being postponed every single time while our children are dying on a daily basis.\"\n\n\"We are calling on them, to go down and be with us on the ground and see first-hand, instead of coming out and announcing big things and programmes that do nothing and announcing issues and having summits in nice cosy places,\" Masango said.\n\nAccused's family evicted from rented flat\n\nWhile the matter against the accused has been postponed to November 28 for further investigation, a number of residents went to the flat that the accused was said to be renting with his mother, girlfriend and their three-month-old child.\n\nThe irate group sang struggles songs outside of the house, and demanded that the family of the accused leave the area immediately.\n\nAfter a prolonged argument with the landlord, the group made their way to the flat and removed the belongings of the family, effectively evicting them.", "description": "Lobby group Not in My Name has called out political leaders for not being \"on the ground\" at a court case where a 26-year-old man has been accused of raping his neighbour's six-year-old daughter in Mamelodi.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9461/4ddf0574926748dab268a3359100dce1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
