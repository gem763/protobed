I didn't expect the women to look too, but to be fair everyone loves boobs. I would look too.\n\n\"I'm happy I did it because of the positive feedback.\n\n\"It was kind of funny, I don't notice it at any other time.\n\n(Image: Chris Zelig)\n\n\"I mean, I thought it was hilarious. Humour is one of my favourite things and if we can use humour to raise awareness I'm all for it.\n\n\"If one woman is inspired to check herself or get a mammogram from this video I will be happy.\n\n\"I'm doing it for a bigger cause. This is bigger than the video or me, this is about our mums, grandmothers, children, sisters and friends.\"\n\nWhitney, who works in PR, created the video with her brother Chris and their best friend CJ Koegel.\n\n(Image: Chris Zelig)\n\nThe two men did a similar video in 2014 to raise awareness of prostate cancer and it ended up going viral, so wanted to repeat it with breast cancer.\n\nWhitney and Chris's mum has had breast cancer, overcoming it twice and she's just had the all clear from her 10 year check up.\n\nWhitney said: \"She's a wonderful woman. It's a cause very dear to our hearts.\n\n\"She was so inspired afterwards that she decided to further her studies and became an oncology nurse.\"\n\n(Image: Chris Zelig)\n\nThe original woman who was due to be the actress dropped out so Whitney offered to step in as she was so keen to raise awareness.\n\n\"I volunteered not really knowing what I was getting into. I'm happy I did because of all the positive feedback.\n\n\"It's not about me it's about raising awareness and early detection.\n\n\"If my mum didn't check herself she wouldn't be here.\"\n\nThe video has already been viewed more than 180,000 times and attracted a lot of attention on social media.\n\nWhitney said: \"The reaction has been positive. A lot of people reached out with similar stories about cancer.\"", "description": "Whitney Zelig was completely shocked by how many people stared at her chest as she walked around New York, but she's glad she did it", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Chris Zelig"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20717569.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Woman-secretly-films-people-looking-at-her-chest-for-breast-cancer-awareness.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
