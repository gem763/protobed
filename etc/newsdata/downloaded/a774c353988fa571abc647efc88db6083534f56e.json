Sports bar it is. Hipster cousin in town from Oregon? Take her to that funky brewery down the road. Just swiped by your ex on Tinder? That dark and devilishly dive-y back-alley haunt has a $4 glass of Chardonnay might help.\n\nThen there are times when you need a space with a bit of history. Maybe your boss has invited you for drinks and asked you to choose the spot, or you just want a solid bar to rest your novel on while you finish the last few chapters.\n\nWhatever your reason to visit, some of the most wistfully historic drinking establishments in the country exist within the doors of our oldest hotels. From the stately Fairmont Royal York in downtown Toronto to the 107-year-old Sylvia Hotel on the banks of English Bay in Vancouver, here are five Canadian hotel and inn bars that will make you feel like you\u2019ve travelled through time.\n\nBar at Sylvia, Sylvia Hotel , Vancouver, BC\n\nThe Sylvia Hotel in Vancouver\u2019s West End is one of those places that draws guests back for decades. There\u2019s a good chance your grandmother has a story or two about staying there in the 70s. And depending on how cool a granny she is, she might also have a story about the cocktail lounge, which the hotel claims was the first in the city. Now simply called \u2018Bar at Sylvia\u2019, the bar inside this heritage building has been tastefully updated over the years, but, much like the hotel itself, still retains its old-school vibes and beach views. Visit on a Sunday, Wednesday or Thursday to catch the live music, and order a martini, just like Granny would have\n\nGrapes Wine Bar , Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel\n\nBanff may be one of the hottest tourist spots in the country\u2014the national park nearby welcomed over four million visitors in the 2018/19 season\u2014but back in 1887 when construction of the Fairmont Banff Springs began, it was but a blip (albeit a gorgeous blip) on the tourism radar.\n\nTucked away within the expansive property, Grapes Charcuterie and Wine Bar does an outstanding job of channelling the tranquil yet exciting atmosphere of that era of Canadian history. The offerings are simple yet delicious and the setting intimate. Charcuterie stacked with house-cured meats, homemade pickles, artisanal cheeses and more is served alongside a curated selection of national and international wines.\n\nLibrary Bar , Fairmont Royal York, Toronto\n\nWhen it opened in 1929, the Fairmont Royal York across from Union Station in Toronto was the tallest building in the city. The Library Bar was opened on the ground floor of the building in 1972, modelled after the hotel\u2019s grand library.\n\nWith its contemporary by way of traditional decor, Library Bar has always been a popular spot to impress a client from out of town over a beer or steal a cheeky cocktail with a lover, but today it\u2019s most known for its afternoon tea service and classic cocktail menu.\n\nStop by on your way in or out of the city\u2014the Fairmont Royal York is located directly in front of Union Station smack dab in the heart of Toronto.\n\nThe Olde Angel Inn , Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario\n\nThe Olde Angel Inn in Niagara-on-the-Lake in wine country, Ontario, is the oldest establishment on this list by quite a margin. The inn was opened in 1789 (yes, those numbers are in the correct order) and then rebuilt after it was burned in the War of 1812, making it Ontario\u2019s oldest operating inn. And as the oldest, it\u2019s also among the most haunted. Rumours documented by the venue itself tell of a young colonel in the War of 1812 who hid in a barrel in the cellar only to be bayoneted to death by American soldiers.\n\nSit in the low-ceilinged bar and grab a pint of the Angel Inn IPA (beware, it\u2019s actually Amsterdam Brewing Co\u2019s high-test, 7.1% ABV Boneshaker). Then just try not to think about ghost soldiers as you visit the washrooms conveniently located in the creepy basement.\n\nThe Arms Public House , Lord Nelson Hotel and Suites, Halifax, Nova Scotia\n\nThere\u2019s no mistaking the pub known colloquially as \u2018The Arms\u2019 for anything other than traditionally English. The decor of ample wood and gold ceiling tiles; the menu of hearty salads, soups and fish dishes; the lively vibe\u2026 it\u2019s all bloody British in the best way!\n\nExpect a lively experience most evenings, as The Arms is a popular spot to meet up and celebrate for locals and travellers alike. The kitchen and terrace overlooking the public garden, on the other hand, is open for breakfast, brunch and lunch if you\u2019re looking for a more relaxing experience.", "description": "Raise a glass in these storied bars, and then get a room upstairs.\u00a0There is a moment for every type of bar.\u00a0Team made the finals?
