A European, world, and Olympic gold medal-winning amateur, it was not long before Usyk transferred his success in the unpaid ranks into the professional circuit, winning a world cruiserweight title in only his 10th bout in 2016.\n\nWithin two years Usyk had beaten many of the top cruiserweights, winning all the major titles in the division, as well as the World Boxing Super Series final and the Muhammad Ali trophy.\n\nHe has now left cruiserweight behind and is expected to make his heavyweight debut later in the year. But he is not the only Ukrainian to dominate at the highest echelon of the sport.\n\nVasyl Lomachenko has been called \"the greatest fighter since Floyd Mayweather,\" and defends his world lightweight titles against Luke Campbell at the 02 Arena in London on Saturday.\n\nRead more: 'Vasyl Lomachenko is the greatest fighter since Floyd Mayweather,' but those close to his opponent Luke Campbell expect the Englishman to pull off an upset for the ages on Saturday\n\nBusiness Insider asked many of the people involved in the Lomachenko vs. Campbell fight why Ukraine has emerged as a fighting powerhouse in the last decade.\n\nThrough a translator, and talking with a grin on his face, Usyk told us, \"that's a secret \u2026 a national secret of Ukraine.\"\n\nThe translator then started laughing, before saying Usyk had said: \"We eat a lot of pork fat. Other countries with good amateur programs like Cuba have no fat, no pork fat. But even if they did, they'd never get strong because they are not Ukrainians.\"\n\nUsyk put his hand on our shoulder, looked us in the eye, and said: \"Pork fat \u2026 remember that.\"\n\nGovernment funding helped Ukrainian boxing flourish\n\nOleksandr Usyk.

A lot of them are southpaws. They're extremely light on their feet. And they control the ring really well. Those are the keys to success as an amateur but also the transformation into being a pro.\"\n\nBrad Jacobs, the chief operating officer at Las Vegas fight firm Top Rank, which promotes Lomachenko, told us there is another obvious answer \u2014 someone athletes affectionately call \"Papachenko.\"\n\nThat is the nickname given to Anatoliy Lomachenko, who trains the unbeaten light heavyweight Oleksandr Gvozdyk, Usyk, the Ukraine amateur boxing team, and, of course, his son Vasyl.\n\nRead more: The 18-year-old Israeli MMA fighter who secured an 11-second submission win told us he was targeting the Bellator record before the bout had even begun\n\nAnatoliy Lomachenko's methods are unconventional, and he often avoids the limelight. When his son was a child, he withdrew him from boxing training and instead put him in dance classes for more than a year to improve his footwork, before putting him back into boxing as an improved fighter.\n\n\"Lomachenko's father is an incredible coach, trainer, mentor,\" Jacobs told Business Insider. \"He's really ultimately responsible for the success of these fighters.\"\n\nLomachenko, Eddie Hearn, and Luke Campbell. Photo by James Chance/Getty Images\n\nEddie Hearn, the group managing director of Matchroom Sport, which promotes Lomachenko's opponent Campbell, says there's also been an influx of government funding into the sport, which helped amateur boxing in Ukraine flourish.\n\nRead more: Tyson Fury warned Anthony Joshua that his Saudi Arabia rematch against Andy Ruiz is heading for 'disaster'\n\n\"The background and pedigree is very tough,\" Hearn told Business Insider. \"You've got a great trainer in Papachenko, as he's called there.\n\n\"Everywhere just goes through cycles. It's not this new phase coming out the Eastern bloc, they've always been there, but the investment from the government into amateur boxing has meant that those fighters become a lot more apparent and those fighters have better funding and can go into all these tournaments and win them.\n\n\"You've got two guys in Usyk and Lomachenko who are probably top three pound-for-pound in the world, both of them. Then you've got Gvozdyk, the light heavyweight, another great fighter who is going to be unifying against Artur Beterbiev later in the year. And other fighters coming through from that territory as well.\n\n\"They train hard, they're tough people.\"", "description": "Vasyl Lomachenko fights Luke Campbell at the 02 Arena Saturday and Business Insider asked people involved in the bout why Ukraine boxers are so good.", "authors": ["Alan Dawson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6a5e1d2e22af59107a2f33-1334-667.jpg"}
