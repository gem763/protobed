Public Schools will plug budget hole with boost from mayor\u2019s office", "language": "en", "text": "Under District law, government agencies cannot carry debt from fiscal year to fiscal year. That means the school system \u2014 with a budget of more than $900 million \u2014 has until Sept. 30 to plug a hole.\n\nAD\n\nThe $10 million deficit represents about 1 percent of the budget.\n\nJeffrey S. Dewitt, the city\u2019s chief financial officer, wrote in a Sept. 13 letter to D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) that the mayor\u2019s budget office will \u201cexecute a reprogramming\u201d for the remaining funds.\n\nAD\n\nThat means Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) will shift funds to the school system from agencies that have unused money in their coffers at the end of the fiscal year.\n\n\u201cThe District has ended each of the last 24 fiscal years with balanced budgets,\u201d read DeWitt\u2019s letter, which was shared with The Washington Post. \u201cBe assured that this year will be no different.\u201d\n\nThe school system has said that it instituted a hiring freeze at its headquarters office and has curtailed employee travel and training to cut costs.\n\nAD\n\nKihn said in a July interview that the school system employed more effective and experienced teachers than it had anticipated, which contributed to the deficit.\n\nThe school system awards bonuses based on the outcomes of teachers\u2019 annual assessments, with teachers ranked \u201ceffective\u201d and \u201chighly effective\u201d receiving more money. Experienced teachers typically earn higher salaries.\n\nAD\n\nCosts for overtime \u2014 which staff members earn if they perform tasks outside the terms of their contracts, including teaching additional courses \u2014 also contributed to the deficit.\n\nThe deficit drew criticism from city leaders who said it represented irresponsible spending.\n\nMendelson said it showed a \u201clack of discipline.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy understanding is the deficit came about from hiring individuals at salaries that were higher than what the overall budget for the school system would permit,\u201d Mendelson said at a Sept. 16 news conference. \u201cThat suggests a lack of discipline from the HR office at DCPS or a lack of discipline elsewhere among managers at DCPS.\u201d\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news\n\nAD", "description": "The school system closed about $15\u00a0million of its $25\u00a0million budget shortfall.", "authors": ["Perry Stein", "Reporter Covering D.C.
