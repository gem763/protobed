This is the subtext of a Politico piece giving Republicans focused on 2020 state legislative battlegrounds the opportunity to whine and rattle their cups as they explain how outgunned they feel compared to their Democratic foes. They do have the very valid point to make that this isn\u2019t just any old state legislative election cycle: it\u2019s the one immediately preceding the next decennial round of congressional and state legislative redistricting. So the outcomes are a pretty big deal, at least in those states where legislatures retain control over redistricting (as opposed to those where independent commissions are in charge of the map-drawing \u2014 four for congressional districts and six for state legislative districts).\n\nSenior Republicans concede they\u2019re at risk of losing dozens of state-level elections that will determine who wields power over the post-2020 congressional map \u2014 and potentially which party controls the chamber for the following 10 years. While Republicans are establishing a massive national infrastructure devoted to reelecting President Donald Trump and winning congressional majorities, party officials say the state legislative races are being overlooked.\n\nThe trepidation comes as an array of well-funded Democratic groups \u2014 including one with the backing of former President Barack Obama and ex-Attorney General Eric Holder \u2014 are flooding cash into Virginia, a key redistricting battleground that\u2019s holding state legislative elections this fall.\n\nDemocrats are expected to plow tens of millions into races next year.\n\n\u201cThis is as serious as a heart attack and we\u2019ve got to do everything we can to win it because this isn\u2019t about one cycle. It\u2019s about the next decade. And our success nationally as a party is going to depend on our success in these states this cycle,\u201d said Republican State Leadership Committee President Austin Chambers. He acknowledged that his party is less focused on statehouse contests than Democrats are.\n\nIt\u2019s true the off-year Virginia elections, in which Republicans are defending slender margins in both chambers, are the kind of events where concentrated resources can make a difference \u2014 and occur at a time when there are fewer competing demands on party coffers. But 2020 is another thing altogether. One of the corollaries of a steady trend toward straight-ticket voting is that down-ballot races in presidential election years are heavily affected by presidential results. In 2015, data hound David Byler (then with RealClearPolitics, now with the Washington Post) took a long look at this phenomenon, and concluded there was only so much the parties could do to decouple state legislative from presidential outcomes:\n\nDemocratic Party leaders will almost certainly put increased money and manpower into these elections in 2016, but funding, advertising and campaigning on the local level can only do so much. The national political atmosphere will play an outsized role in determining the outcome of state legislative contests. Specifically, the outcome of the presidential race will likely shape the composition of state legislatures across the country.\n\nThat indeed seemed to be the case in 2016, an election where (famously, and for the first time ever) straight-ticket voting meant that no state went one way in the presidential election and another in a Senate selection. Flips in control of state legislative chambers followed presidential trends, per this summary from Ballotpedia:\n\nGiven the apocalyptic environment surrounding the 2020 presidential race, with both parties focused on base mobilization driven by love or hatred of Donald Trump dominating every conversation, the odds of the straight-ticket trend abating are very low. Like the fights over control of Congress, the future of the Supreme Court, and a host of policy issues, state legislative results will be controlled less by the \u201cinvestments\u201d Republicans are hoping for than by arguably the highest-stakes presidential contest in at least a generation or two. The people quoted by Politico are constantly contrasting the partisan focus on state legislatures heading toward 2020 with that ten years ago, when Republicans spent a lot of money and made massive gains:\n\nThe GOP\u2019s redistricting troubles represent a complete turnabout for the party. In the run-up to the 2010 election, Chambers\u2019 group outspent its Democratic counterpart nearly 3-to-1, helping Republicans net nearly 700 seats and flip control of 20 legislative bodies.\n\nThat election, of course, was a midterm, which has very different dynamics than a presidential election. Even then, though, national trends \u2014 a very visible and universal backlash to Democratic landslides in 2006 and 2008, and to the newly elected president \u2014 almost certainly had more to do with Republican state legislative gains than \u201ctargeting\u201d or \u201cresources\u201d devoted to that task. Sure, at the margins, such efforts mattered and always will. But let\u2019s not get carried away with the illusion that down-ballot races are going to follow an independent trajectory from the obsessive cage match of Trump versus Somebody.\n\nIf you look at the 2020 target states for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee \u2014 the Obama\u2013Holder group that Republicans have been pointing to as potentially eating their lunch \u2014 it\u2019s clear the real players in this game understand what\u2019s likely to happen. All nine of them (Florida, Georgia, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) are definite or potential presidential battleground states. If the Democratic presidential nominee does very well next year, so will the NDRC. And if that means Republicans will go into the 2021 redistricting process with diminished hopes, it\u2019s just another price they\u2019ve paid for slavish loyalty to Donald J. Trump.", "description": "Republicans fear Democrats are outgunning them in preparations for the 2020 state legislative races that will shape redistricting.
