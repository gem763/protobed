Canadians are encouraged to wear their pyjamas to school or work, make a small donation and share their photos on social media using the hashtag #SleepDay. All proceeds go directly to the purchase of bedkits for children living in challenging conditions in developing countries. Sleep Day is generously supported by signature sponsor, Choice Hotels Canada, and with sponsorship from Sleep Country Canada.\n\nSleep Day is a national call to action in support of the charity started by Murray and Margaret Dryden, founded 49 years ago. In the past three years, Sleep Day participants have collectively donated hundreds of bedkits that have provided a better night sleep to children living in poverty. A global community of partners and volunteers, Sleeping Children has transformed the lives of more than 1.6 million children in developing countries through bedkit distributions.\n\nThis year, Sleep Day falls on Giving Tuesday, a global movement for giving and volunteering which takes place on the Tuesday after Black Friday. Sleeping Children is encouraging all to join in this international day of charitable giving and support Sleep Day in its mission to provide children with a good night\u2019s sleep.\n\n\u201cOur goal at Sleeping Children Around the World is to keep children happy, healthy and hopeful,\u201d said Debbie Will-Dryden, Chair of Sleeping Children Around the World and granddaughter of the charity\u2019s founders, Murray and Margaret Dryden. \u201cGood quality sleep is vital to a child\u2019s development and health, the lack of which is a global problem that we are committed to solving, one bedkit at a time. Our annual Sleep Day event is a fantastic opportunity to raise awareness and get even more people involved.\u201d\n\nSleeping Children encourages workplaces and schools to participate on December 3rd with employees, faculty and students donning their pyjamas all day with a small donation. Employees can donate a minimum of $5 each and $2 for every participating student. Engaging employees, school faculty and students by creating a fun Sleep Day event such as a potluck, best PJ contest or pancake breakfast is highly encouraged. For more information on how to engage your workplace or school, and educational resources, visit, www.sleepday.ca.\n\nSleeping Children is pleased to announce Choice Hotels Canada as the signature sponsor for Sleep Day. \u201cThis is our fourth year supporting Sleep Day. After years of providing our guests with a good night\u2019s sleep we are grateful for the opportunity to help provide quality sleep for children around the world,\u201d said Brian Leon, President, Choice Hotels Canada. \u201cIt is important for us to appreciate the things that are commonly taken for granted and supporting those less fortunate \u2013 that\u2019s what Sleep Day is all about for us.\u201d\n\nSleep Country Canada is also supporting the initiative. \u201cFor 25 years, we've been committed to helping Canadians get a better night's sleep,\" said Christine Magee, Co-Founder & Chair of Sleep Country Canada. \"In Sleeping Children Around the World, we found a great partner that shares in our commitment to sleep. We are proud to support Sleep Day for a fourth year, helping children around the world improve their sleep and work towards a healthier future.\"\n\nEvery Sleep Day donation helps support Sleeping Children Around the World create much needed bedkits for children living in challenging conditions in developing countries. Just $35 is needed to make a bedkit which consists of a mat or mattress, a mosquito net to combat the threat of malaria and other vector-borne diseases, schoolbag and school supplies, clothing and footwear. Whether you're a big company, a small community organization, or a local school, every pair of pajamas worn on Sleep Day helps a child in need receive a better night's sleep. With sleep, the promise of a better tomorrow is realized.\n\nAbout Sleeping Children Around the World\n\nSince its inception by Murray and Margaret Dryden in 1970, the charity has raised over $45 million to provide bedkits for more than 1.6 million children in 34 countries. For every $35 bedkit donation, 100% reaches a child in extreme poverty.
