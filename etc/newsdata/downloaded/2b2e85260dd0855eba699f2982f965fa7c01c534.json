Not so much anymore.\n\nNo Eden Hazard, a transfer embargo and a young manager with an even younger squad hardly seemed like ideal circumstances for a top four challenge.\n\nBut, heading into the second international break of the season, Chelsea look as well-placed as anyone to make a push for one of those coveted Champions League positions behind Liverpool and Manchester City after brushing aside Southampton to go fifth.\n\nMichy Batshuayi finished off the victory with a neat finish following a slick interchange, as Chelsea produced a 4-1 victory\n\nThe Belgian forward kept his cool to pull off a close-range finish and slot the ball under Angus Gunn at the near post\n\nBatshuayi roared at the travelling Chelsea supportersafter wrapping up all three points after a good afternoon\n\nN'Golo Kante's powerfully hit effort from the edge of the area bamboozled the keeper and gave Chelsea a healthy 3-1 margin\n\nThe Frenchman's shot deflected off defender Maya Yoshida in the process and altered its flight trajectory in mid-air\n\nMATCH FACTS AND PLAYER RATINGS SOUTHAMPTON (4-2-2-2): Gunn 5; Valery 7, Yoshida 6.5, Bednarek 5, Bertrand 6; Romeu 6, Hojbjerg 6; Ward-Prowse 6, Redmond 6 (Boufal 81); Ings 6 (Adams 80), Long 5 (Obafemi 73) Not used: McCarthy, Stephens, Adams, Armstrong, Danso Goals: Ings 30 Booked: NONE Manager: Ralph Hasenhuttl 6 CHELSEA (4-3-3): Kepa 6; Azpilicueta 7, Zouma 5.5, Tomori 6, Alonso 7; Kante 7.5, Jorginho 8, Mount 7.5 (Kovacic 79); Willian 7.5, Abraham 7.5 (Batshuyi 84), Hudson-Odoi 7.5 (Pulisic 79) Not used: Caballero, Christensen, Barkley, James Goals: Abraham 17, Mount 24, Kante 30, Batshuayi 89 Booked: Jorginho Manager: Frank Lampard 8 Referee: Paul Tierney 6 Attendance: 31,473\n\nOnly goal difference separates them and fourth-placed Leicester while they are just two points off second.\n\nThe youngsters Lampard has introduced have injected a vibrancy and energy into this Chelsea side and dovetailed seamlessly with the more seasoned campaigners.\n\nTogether they have thrived with the shackles taken off them and formed a team their supporters can love again. It is all a far cry from last season under Maurizio Sarri.\n\nThere was more evidence of how things are clicking into place nicely for Chelsea at St Mary's which has become more of a happier home for Chelsea than Southampton recently.\n\nTammy Abraham and Mason Mount scored Chelsea's first two goals and Callum Hudson-Odoi also impressed on his return to Chelsea's Premier League starting side, all good news for England boss Gareth Southgate who has the first two in his current squad and Hudson-Odoi in the under-21s.\n\nThen N'Golo Kante scored Chelsea's third before the old guard, led by vice-captain Jorginho and Willian, helped the Blues expertly manage the rest of the game, before Michy Batshuayi applied the late gloss.\n\nA few shaky defensive moments, not least for Southampton's consolation, showed there is still work to be done defensively which Lampard, never one to get carried away, highlighted himself at full-time.\n\nOn this occasion though, they were up against a side who made many more errors and Chelsea took full advantage of their generous hosts.\n\nThe goalkeeper was left topping backwards into his own net after the ball veered off and added to Chelsea's healthy lead\n\nLess than ten minutes before Kante's strike, Danny Ings (left) popped up in the Blues box to pull off a poacher's finish\n\nGoalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga (right) could not react in time to prevent the glancing effort from sliding beneath him\n\nThis was Chelsea's fifth win a row here, an outcome that prompted boos from the home fans at full time. No wonder.\n\nThey have not seen a home win since April, only two anywhere in the league since and remain just a point outside the drop zone. These are increasingly worrying times for boss Ralph Hasenhuttl.\n\nHasenhuttl handed Shane Long a first start of the season and Southampton's high-pressing start pointed to why he had been selected.\n\nAfter one turnover deep in Chelsea territory, Nathan Redmond had Kepa briefly panicking as his drive flashed inches over just 45 seconds in.\n\nChelsea were causing their own problems too with their use of the ball at the back and hearts were briefly in mouths when Kepa took his time on the ball as Danny Ings closed in.\n\nAs it turned out, he got rid of the ball just in time and started the counter which led to Chelsea's first attempt.\n\nCesar Azpilicueta, recipient of Kepa's pass, released Hudson-Odoi and he set up Abraham whose 20-yard shot forced Gunn into his first save.\n\nYoungster Mason Mount weaved through the Saints defence after Chelsea capitalised upon a poor Angus Gunn clearance\n\nThe Chelsea playmaker kept his cool despite having defenders on his tail, and slotted the ball past the goalkeeper for 2-0\n\nMount gestured to the disappointed home supporters who had been giving him stick prior to his Chelsea goal on Sunday\n\nThat linkup was a sign of things to come six minutes later when Hudson-Odoi picked out Abraham with a ball over the top.\n\nAbraham miscontrolled at first but still had the presence of mind to get his attempt in, sticking out a leg to lift the ball over the onrushing Gunn.\n\nMaya Yoshida sprinted back and looked to have kept the ball out with a brilliant goal-line clearance.\n\nBut his efforts were in vain when referee Paul Tierney's watch buzzed to signal the ball crossed the line and Abraham had his ninth goal of the season to celebrate his England recall on Thursday.\n\nWith a first Champions League goal on Wednesday which was also his birthday it has been a few days to remember for the 22-year-old.\n\nWhile that was a little unlucky for Southampton, they deserved to ship their second seven minutes later.\n\nGunn's poor kick was intercepted by Mount, Bednarek's header was by Willian and Chelsea worked the ball through to Mount who thumped in his fourth of the season.\n\nThe Portsmouth-born attacking midfielder loved it too, cupping his ears in celebration in front of a section of the home fans.\n\nTammy Abraham broke the deadlock after lobbing the ball over the onrushing Gunn, with Yoshida trying to track back\n\nThe ball looked to have been cleared off the line by Yoshida but Abraham immediately appealed that it had indeed crossed\n\nGunn looked crestfallen as goal-line technology confirmed Abraham's effort had gone over and would stand as a goal\n\nThe Chelsea academy starlet punched the air in joy after scoring yet another goal for Frank Lampard's youthful side\n\nHe was not far off rubbing it in twice more but side-footed over and then wide in quick succession. Hasenhuttl was visibly fuming at his side's defending but then much happier on the half hour.\n\nRecalled right back Yan Valery burst through a group of four Chelsea players and then beat another two before crossing for Danny Ings to turn in his fourth goal in three matches. Game on. For 10 minutes anyway. Then Southampton were opened up with ease again.\n\nMarcos Alonso found Kante in way too much space just outside the box and his drive deflected in off Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. Southampton were jeered off, for the first time, at the break and Gunn prevented the damage getting worse with second-half saves from Hudson-Odoi and Abraham.\n\nThere were a couple more moments of indecision from England newboy Fikayo Tomori and Kurt Zouma that threatened to give Southampton opportunities but Kepa's goal was never under threat. The jubilant away fans mocked the home ones by chanting 'oh when the Saints go marching out' when the late exodus begun.\n\nAnd it became a mass one in the 89th minute when Chelsea subs Christian Pulisic and Michy Batshuayi combined and the Belgian slid in number four.", "description": "ADRIAN KAJUMBA  AT ST MARY'S STADIUM: Initially\u00a0it appeared it a tall order as Frank Lampard returned to Chelsea and outlined determination to retain their top four place.
