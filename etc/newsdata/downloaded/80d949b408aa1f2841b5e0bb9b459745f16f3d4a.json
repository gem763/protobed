It has become my home. It is everything to me.\n\n'Wearing the green and gold of the Springboks is a huge honour for me. That jersey is part of me. The green and gold flows in my blood.'\n\nFinally, he was accepted as a citizen and went on to become a great. Only 2007 World Cup winners Victor Matfield and Bryan Habana have played more the Boks than him now - and now on the verge of joining them as a world champion, the first black African Springbok to reach 100 caps realises the significance of Saturday.\n\nNot just for him, but for a nation.\n\n'I was just a primary school kid in Zimbabwe back in 1995,' said Mtawarira of the first time South Africa topped the world.\n\n'I didn't watch rugby then. I was playing soccer.\n\n'In 2007 I did watch and it was amazing, inspirational stuff and to be part of a World Cup final is a dream come true for me.\n\n'I have worked hard throughout my career to get here and I want to make it count.'\n\nOver recent years, the South Africa have become a far more multi-cultural, representative side\n\nThe Beast has not just been an iconic Bok because of his destructive style, but by what he represents - a black man picked by the team that has been desperate to rid itself of its Apartheid past not just because of the colour of his skin, but because he was the best.\n\nLook across the South African team now and you see a far more multi-cultural, representative picture. The likes of Bongi Mbonambi, Makazole Mapimpi, Lukanyo Am, Sbu Nkosi play alongside Afrikaners Lood de Jager, Pieter Steph du Toit and Faf de Klerk.\n\nAnd then there is the captain, the shining great symbol of progress, Siya Kolisi. The boy from the township who could lift the Webb Ellis Trophy.\n\n'It would be extra special,' added Mtawarira on the prospect of the Boks winning the World Cup with their first black captain.\n\n'Siya is an inspirational leader. In the way South Africa has got behind him, it means a lot to unite the country.\n\n'He has been exemplary. It would be amazing to win this World Cup with him as captain.'\n\nThe prop praised Siya Kolisi, who made history as the Springboks' first ever black captain\n\nBut while the Beast hopes for a fairytale ending, there will be nothing PG about the Boks' approach to England on Saturday.\n\n'Every time we play against each other it's always a physical onslaught and I don't think it will be any different,' he said of the final.\n\n'There's definitely a mutual respect between the two countries. The best way we can assure that is by going hard against each other.\n\n'We're the underdogs. We are going to have to play out of our skins to win it.' Whatever happens the Beast has already won the hearts of a nation.", "description": "INTERVIEW: The Beast is hoping for some beauty at the end of his Springbok story.
