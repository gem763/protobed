He did not disappoint. The ex-VP explained what he'd want in a running mate and acknowledged his continued support among African Americans isn't guaranteed.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s campaign convened a dozen or so black reporters from major media outlets Tuesday for what was offered as a private, off-the-record sit-down with the Democratic front-runner.\n\nBut Biden opened the discussion allowing himself to be quoted. And then he started talking, he talked some more, and before everyone knew it, the former vice president had held forth for 90 minutes. That's an extraordinary amount of time for a major presidential candidate to meet the media in a single sitting.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDonning a blue suit and white shirt with no tie, Biden greeted each reporter and took a question \u2014 in some cases, multiple questions \u2014 from each one. He then darted off to catch a flight to Richmond, Va., where he was scheduled to hold a fundraiser before heading to South Carolina for a campaign swing on Wednesday.\n\nBiden didn't make big news, but he offered his insights on an array of interesting topics and kept the group's attention during the marathon session. Here are some of the highlights.\n\nWhat he wants in a running mate\n\nBiden said it\u2019s important to choose a No. 2 who reflects the nation\u2019s growing diversity, indicating he would choose a running mate who is either a woman or person of color, if not both.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not making that commitment until I know the person I\u2019m dealing with, I can completely, thoroughly trust, is authentic and is on the same page,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden said that the presidency \u201cis too big for any one person,\u201d insisting a president needs a vice president he or she can trust to offload big tasks. He recalled the trust former President Barack Obama had in selecting him as his running mate in 2008. Obama knew then, he said, they had the same \u201cvalue set\u201d and \u201cpolitical disposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I most want in whomever I pick,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to be simpatico with what I stand for and what I want to get done.\u201d\n\nEnough with the megadebates\n\nBiden expressed a preference for a smaller debate stage, arguing that it\u2019s difficult for candidates to have an actual debate with so many people crowded onto a single stage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken me, and I assume others, some time to figure out how to engage in a nondebate debate, because there\u2019s no debate,\u201d Biden said. He acknowledged his \u201cmistake\u201d in saying \u201cmy time is up\u201d during a previous debate instead of talking over his allotted speaking time. \u201cTurns out that\u2019s a big mistake.\u201d\n\nBiden said he likes debating on a national stage. He isn't crazy about candidates piling on to him \u2014 as the debate format has almost encouraged \u2014 but he gets why it's happening. As the front-runner, Biden stands center stage and is often the target of lower-polling candidates seeking a breakout moment.\n\n\u201cI understand why there\u2019s a target on my back. I get it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes sense. I\u2019m ahead \u2014 in most polls, way ahead. So what do you do? You want to get the chance to, you know, raise your profile and take down Biden.\u201d\n\nBut all that does, he warned, is help Trump. Plus, \u201cthose who\u2019ve made the most direct attacks on one another haven\u2019t really benefited much by it at the end of the day. So maybe there\u2019s going to be a recognition \u2026 that maybe we should be talking about the future, what are we for, what are we going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really hard. It\u2019s hard for everybody.\u201d\n\nWhat about Kamala and Cory?\n\nIn poll after poll, black voters prefer Biden over anyone else. But why him over, say, Kamala Harris or Cory Booker, both of whom are African American?\n\nBiden said he doesn\u2019t know.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/2048/1155968404_6053294016001_6053279540001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nBut he framed his lengthy record as both good news and bad news. \u201cPeople know me, or at least they think they know me,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI think after all this time, they think they have a sense of what my character is and who I am \u2014 warts and all.\u201d\n\nHe said it\u2019s tough to explain why black voters prefer him in such high numbers over his opponents but noted he\u2019s never felt uncomfortable being in a black community.\n\n\u201cBy the way, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll stay that way,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can go back and look: When Barack clobbered me in the campaign, you know, I had more black support in South Carolina than anybody, including him. I got blown out in Iowa and all of a sudden everything changed. Same thing could happen.\u201d\n\nMocking Trump\n\nBiden broadly referenced some of the \u201creally talented people seeking the nomination\u201d but suggested that candidates who believe they can\u2019t work with Republicans to get things done \u201ccash it in, man.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow you gonna get anything done without abusing power?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201c\u2019When I get elected, I\u2019m going to issue an executive order,\u2019\" he said in a booming voice, eerily similar to the voice Trump deploys to mock people. \u201cYou have no constitutional authority to issue that executive order, the ones they\u2019re talking about. \u2018I\u2019m going to eliminate assault weapons\u2019 \u2014 can\u2019t do it by executive order any more than Trump can do the things he\u2019s saying he can do by executive order.\u201d\n\nHe praised the late Arizona Sen. John McCain for his willingness to buck the president and his party when his beliefs called for it, lamenting that there aren\u2019t enough Republicans like him nowadays.\n\nWorking across the aisle will be tough, Biden said. But he assured reporters he could pass health care legislation through Congress and a bill fundamentally changing how drug research is funded.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m wrong, we\u2019re in real trouble,\u201d he warned of his bipartisan approach to politics. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how we do it if we don\u2019t try.\u201d\n\n'Most of you don\u2019t know much about the '70s and the '80s'\n\nWith the exception of Bernie Sanders, Biden is the oldest Democrat in the primary. Oftentimes, so are his tales on the trail.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I do think I have to be more aware of is most of you don\u2019t know much about the \u201870s and the \u201880s,\u201d Biden told the room of reporters. \u201cUnderstandably. Some of you weren\u2019t even born.\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/50/db/581f0d1d4224ac5c5c0f7e7c76f0/age-explainer-thumbnail.png\"\n\nHe cited the 1994 crime bill as an example. Biden said the black community overwhelmingly supported the legislation at the time, but critics of the legislation now say it contributed to mass incarceration of people of color.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d Biden said of consistently adding decades-old context. \u201cI\u2019m not being critical. I\u2019m just saying I\u2019ve got to be aware that when things are said by me or about something I did or said in 1970 or 1980, people don\u2019t understand the context, and it really is a frightening thing.\u201d\n\nBiden conceded he was wrong earlier this summer when he recalled fondly working with segregationists in the Senate to pass legislation despite their ideological differences. In retrospect, he said, he never should have invoked the lawmakers without adding the proper context.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not using those examples anymore,\u201d he said.\n\n", "description": "The ex-VP explained what he'd want in a running mate and acknowledged his continued support among African Americans isn't guaranteed.", "authors": ["Nolan D.
