China agreed to purchases of $40 billion-$50 billion in U.S. agriculture goods.\n\nBut farmers are not letting their guard down just yet. Blake Hurst, president of the Missouri Farm Bureau and a soybean farmer, and Tim Bardole, president of the Iowa Soybean Association, each stressed to Yahoo Finance that they remain \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe promise of $50 billion would be twice our highest year ever, so if that comes to fruition, then it\u2019s a wonderful day for U.S. agriculture,\u201d Hurst said. \u201cThe challenge we have is that we\u2019ve been promised a lot of things throughout these negotiations and not all of them have come to fruition.\u201d\n\nFarmers are still skeptical of the latest trade news.

In December 2018, the two countries were seemingly on good terms following the G20 Summit, and China resumed buying U.S. soybeans. However, tensions resumed after the U.S. increased its tariffs to 15% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re talking $40-$50 billion, that would be a huge boost to the ag economy,\u201d Bardole said. \u201cI\u2019m a little skeptical whether it will ever reach that high, but if it comes to pass, it would definitely do a lot to heal some of the wounds that have financially happened here in the last 18 months.\u201d\n\n\u2018We haven\u2019t heard any numbers out of China\u2019\n\nThe issue at hand, Hurst explained, is that the promise of China buying U.S. agriculture goods has only been mentioned by the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t heard any numbers out of China,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to hear. The market will anticipate the sales. Even if they\u2019re several months in the future, we\u2019ll start seeing better prices as soon as they think those sales are going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe other problem is that China has not always been true to its word, often reneging on its promises.\n\n\u201cWe get this new story that we\u2019re going to have this great deal as we had back in the spring, and then the Chinese went home, and a week later, it went away,\u201d Hurst said. \u201cThen we didn\u2019t have negotiations for several months, so once bitten, twice shy. We obviously have to wait and see.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cChina has a history of canceling purchases once they\u2019ve been made. In other words, they\u2019re already going to be loaded on a boat and headed east. And then the sale will be canceled for one reason or another. So we really have learned not to believe it until we see that, as the saying goes, \u2018til the check hits the mailbox.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump announced he reached phase 1 of a trade deal with China on Friday.

Missouri\u2019s exports to China are down 19%, while Iowa\u2019s exports are down a whopping 43% over the last year, according to the U.S.-China Business Council.", "description": "Despite a breakthrough in the trade war with China, American farmers are remaining cautiously optimistic.", "authors": ["Adriana Belmonte", "Associate Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QfTc73T6jdmI7sgx.2Zjsg--~B/aD0zMjYxO3c9NDY1MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/119d06f0-ef70-11e9-9fbd-3f7502bf3bc5", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
