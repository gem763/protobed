All the victims were adults, Rovella said.\n\n\n\n\n\nESCAPE HATCH\n\nSome people on the plane opened an escape hatch and helped others get out, he said.\n\n\"During the course of the next coming days, you're going to hear about some heroic efforts from some of the individuals that were in or around that plane,\" he said.\n\nThe airport, located in the town of Windsor Locks, was closed for about 3-1/2 hours after the crash.\n\nThe plane was operated by the Massachusetts-based Collings Foundation, which is dedicated to the preservation and public display of automotive and aviation-related history.\n\n\"The Collings Foundation flight team is fully cooperating with officials to determine the cause of the crash of the B-17 Flying Fortress and will comment further when details become known,\" the foundation said in a statement.\n\nThe vintage plane was one of only 18 B-17 aircraft still operating in the United States.\n\n\"There's a real need for scrutiny and oversight if these planes are going to continue flying,\" U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, told an earlier news conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Peter Szekely and Maria Caspani in New York, Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Peter Cooney)", "description": "The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress took off from Bradley International Airport on Wednesday morning and the crew contacted the air traffic control tower five minutes later to report a problem, National Transportation Safety Board member Jennifer Homendy said at a news conference.
