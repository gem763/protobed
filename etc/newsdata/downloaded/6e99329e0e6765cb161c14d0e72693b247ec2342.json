(Viens Commission)\n\nThe report is the result of more than nine months of testimony about the decades of abuse, mistreatment and neglect endured by Indigenous people.\n\nThe inquiry was launched in December 2016 by the former Liberal government, under pressure to act in the wake of a Radio-Canada investigation into allegations of police misconduct against Indigenous women in Val-d'Or, a city 500 kilometres northwest of Montreal.\n\nViens was given a broad mandate: To look into the treatment of First Nations and Inuit people in Quebec by the public service. The commission wrapped up its hearings last December.\n\nA total of 1,188 stories and expert opinions were shared over 38 weeks of hearings.\n\nAlthough the hearings were held mainly in Val-d'Or, the commission also travelled to Mani-Utenam, Mistissini and Montreal, as well as Kuujjuaq and Kuujjuarrapik in northern Quebec.\n\nIn all, 277 citizens came forward with personal stories of having dealt with police, hospital staff and other public services, including representatives of the province's youth protection agencies and the justice system.\n\nQuebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault said Monday he would look closely at the report and its recommendations. He said it's clear previous provincial governments must bear responsibility for the poor treatment of First Nations people and Inuit.\n\n\"There are many worrisome things in the report and we need to change the way we provide services to Indigenous people in Quebec,\" Legault said on Radio-Canada's Tout un matin.\n\nLegault is set to meet with Indigenous leaders and address the National Assembly on Wednesday about the report.\n\nPublic Security Minister Genevi\u00e8ve Guilbault, who was in Val-d'Or for the report's release, added the government had called a meeting for Oct. 17 with Indigenous leaders to discuss next steps.\n\nShe, too, said the findings were \"very troubling.\"\n\nPublic Security Minister Genevi\u00e8ve Guilbault, left, Sylvie D'Amours, minister responsible for Indigenous affairs and Lionel Carmant, the minister responsible for youth protection services, were in Val-d'Or to react to the report. (Thomas Deshaies/Radio-Canada)\n\n'Commissions come and go'\n\nIn a statement, the advocacy group Quebec Native Women expressed concern the inquiry's broad mandate had shifted the focus away from those who came forward with allegations against Quebec police.\n\n\"We welcome this work and hope that finally these findings of failure will find appropriate remedies,\" the statement said.\n\n\"On the other hand, it would be wrong to believe that the commission has duly fulfilled its mandate with Indigenous women.\"\n\nViviane Michel is the president of Quebec Native Women. The organization raised concern the broad scope of the report means the problems faced by Indigenous women aren't front and centre. (Catou MacKinnon/CBC)\n\nEdith Cloutier has been at the helm of the Val-d'Or Native Friendship Centre for 28 years and was a key figure in helping Indigenous women in that city come forward with allegations of abuse at the hands of provincial police officers in 2015.\n\nThe report becomes an important tool for the work activists do to fight racism and build bridges with non-Indigenous communities across the country, Cloutier said.\n\n\"There's a lot of research that was done \u2014 and we have elements that would help us work at bridging that gap,\" she said.\n\nThe commission's recommendation that the government apologize to First Nations and Inuit communities will set the stage for what will unfold in terms of the following recommendations, she also noted.\n\n\"We have to \u2026 commend the fact that [Viens'] work wouldn't have any sense if it wasn't for the women that spoke out, and then the different people that told their stories \u2014 Indigenous people that have lived experiences within the public services.\"\n\nEdith Cloutier is executive director of Val-d'Or's Native friendship centre. (CBC)\n\nGhislain Picard, regional chief of the Assembly of First Nations for Quebec and Labrador, commended the report.\n\nBut he said what he really wants is accountability from police about their treatment of Indigenous women .\n\n\"What's missing is obviously the situation that triggered this commission,\" he said. \"This is the issue that we least talk about in the report.\"", "description": "The Quebec government should apologize to First Nations and Inuit for the harm they have endured as a result of provincial laws, policies and practices, says the author of a damning report into the treatment of Indigenous people.", "authors": ["Benjamin Shingler Covers Politics", "Immigration", "Social Issues For Cbc Montreal.
