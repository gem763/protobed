Caesarea Maritima was an ancient city on the Mediterranean coast. The city \u2014 in Roman-ruled Judea \u2014 was built by King Herod the Great between 22\u20136 BC. Among its features were markets, baths, temples, a deep-sea harbour, Herod's palace and a theatre. The theatre hosted regular sports competitions, gladiatorial games and theatrical productions. During the Byzantine period, Caesarea became the capital of the province of Palaestina Prima. The ruins of Caesarea Maritima\n\nThe writing on the tablet was translated by historian Attilio Mastrocinque, of the University of Verona in northern Italy, using Reflectance Transformation Imaging.\n\nThis is a technique in which numerous photographs of an individual object \u2014 each taken under different lighting conditions \u2014 are combined to create an enhanced image which can better reveal surface phenomena like inscriptions.\n\nThis allowed the ancient writing to be read for the first time since it was unearthed by Italian archaeologists in the early fifties \u2014 revealing that the text was an extensive curse, totalling 110 lines in length.\n\n'Tie the feet together, hinder the dance of Manna,' it read in Greek.\n\n'Bind down the eyes, the hands, the feet, which should be slack for Manna when he will dance in the theatre.'\n\nThe architect of the curse beseeches the aid of a number of deities, including the Ibis-headed Egyptian god of writing, wisdom and judgement, Thoth.\n\nAlso invoked are the 'demons of the sky, demons of the air, demons of the earth, underworld demons, demons of the sea, of the rivers [and] demons of the springs.'\n\n'Twist, darken, bind down, bind down together the eyes [of Manna]', the inscription continues \u2014 imploring that 'he should move slowly and lose his equilibrium' and 'should be bent and unseemly.'\n\nAccording to Professor Mastrocinque, the tablet's discovery in the ruins of such a prestigious theatre indicates that Manna 'must have been a famous artist.'\n\nTherefore in the dance competition, he continued, 'the prize would have been considerable, not to mention the fame and reputation that were at stake.'\n\nThe curse's writer called for various gods and demons \u2014 including Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom, writing and judgement \u2014 to 'bind down' and 'bend' their opponent, an athlete named Manna, who likely belonged to a rival faction\n\nAt the time the tablet was inscribed, the city of Caesarea Maritima was controlled by the Byzantine Empire.\n\nGiven this, Professor Mastrocinque believes that the curse writer and his intended victim, Manna, belonged to warring factions.\n\nThese groups \u2014 dominated by the 'blues' and the 'greens' \u2014 fostered intense rivalries, he explained, which could on occasion lead to public riots.\n\nAccording to Professor Mastrocinque, the tablet's discovery in the ruins of such a prestigious theatre indicates that Manna 'must have been a famous artist.' Pictured, the ruins of Caesarea Maritima's theatre\n\nThe 1,500-year-old lead tablet was unearthed in the fifties in the ruins of Caesarea Maritima, Israel, a city built by King Herod the Great around the year 22 BC\n\n'This [curse tablet], along with many others issued in the late imperial period and in the early Middle Ages, confirms that the Christianisation of the Roman Empire did not stop the maleficent magical arts,' wrote Professor Mastrocinque.\n\n'On the contrary, these increasingly spread and became more sophisticated.'\n\nThe tablet, which was gifted to the team that discovered it by the Israeli government, presently resides in the collections of the Archaeological Museum of Milan.\n\nProfessor Mastrocinque presents his work in the book 'Studies in Honour of Roger S.O. Tomlin', which is published by Libros P\u00f3rtico.", "description": "The writing on the tablet was translated by historian Attilio Mastrocinque, of the University of Verona in northern Italy, using an imaging technique that can highlight surface features.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/16/19444420-0-image-a-89_1570546925391.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
