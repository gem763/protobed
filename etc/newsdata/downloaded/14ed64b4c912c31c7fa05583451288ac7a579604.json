In Thursday\u2019s quarterfinal fight, he takes on Rashid Yusupov at Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas. If he wins, he\u2019ll fight later on the same night in the semifinals.\n\nIt\u2019s deja vu for Magalhaes, who won two fights in one night en route to the 2018 final. The UFC veteran says he prefers this format, in which he has a certain period of time to intensify his training as opposed to having to train all year \u2019round.\n\nAnd because of that, he\u2019s been able to have a career resurgence with the PFL.\n\n\u201cPFL pretty much saved my career,\u201d Magalhaes told MMA Junkie. \u201cNot just in a way of, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s better money.\u2019 Yes, it is better money. You stay more consistent, yes, but in general, it turned me into a better athlete. I\u2019ve been a lot more consistent in the gym throughout the year. I\u2019m not doing camps anymore. It\u2019s a seasonal thing. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m training 12 months nonstop, 365 days a year. I\u2019m not doing that.\u201d\n\nFor more from Magalhaes, check out the video above.", "description": "Heading into the PFL's 2019 light heavyweight playoffs, Vinny Magalhaes says the promotion saved his career.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "George Garcia", "Simon Samano", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/off-guard-vinny-magalhaes.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
