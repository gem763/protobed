After Amazon leaked every detail about the upcoming Shield TV Pro, Newegg has now spoiled the reveal of a seemingly more mainstream Shield TV that also supports 4K playback with Dolby Vision. 9to5Google managed to save everything before Newegg wised up and removed the listing. Both streaming devices run Google\u2019s Android TV software.\n\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice about this one is definitely the form factor. Whereas the new flagship Shield TV Pro resembles Nvidia\u2019s old model, this device has a completely fresh cylindrical design. It measures 6.5 inches wide and 1.57 inches tall, according to Newegg. Nvidia has found room for HDMI, microSD, a figure-8 power jack, and even Ethernet in there.\n\nThe 2019 Shield TV is powered by the same X1+ processor as the Pro model, but it comes with half the amount of built-in storage (8GB versus 16GB). Both devices also share the same remote with backlit buttons that illuminate when you pick it up, voice commands, a user-customizable button, IR for TV controls, and a lost remote feature.\n\nThe standard Shield TV will support HDR10, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos, so it checks off all of the format support you\u2019d want. I\u2019m guessing Nvidia will try to differentiate the Pro as the choice for home theater enthusiasts who want to plug in their large media collections over USB.\n\nNewegg had the price for the tube-like Shield TV listed as $199 CA, or around $150 US. The Pro is expected to sell for $200, according to Amazon\u2019s earlier listing, which has also since been pulled.", "description": "Nvidia will soon release a new version of the Shield TV with a much smaller design that should easily disappear behind your TV. The tube-shaped device will also feature Dolby Vision support.", "authors": ["Chris Welch", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dLEGTkzV2UmkTxMOgHRWrSDsI8k=/0x68:918x549/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19296714/nvidia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
