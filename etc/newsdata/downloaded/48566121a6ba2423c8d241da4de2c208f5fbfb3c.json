He had just finished up a small rally in central Iowa, held in a gazebo-like party space overlooking a pond. He seemed a bit riled up, and not in a good way.\n\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d the candidate glared down at a young staffer in front of his podium a few minutes after finishing his remarks. \u201cWhere are we going,\u201d he said again, more pointedly. He became annoyed at a Fox News reporter who asked him about the relative smallness of his crowds compared to those some of the other candidates were attracting \u2014 in this case, Ms. Warren, who had drawn a reported 12,000 at a rally in St. Paul, Minn., the night before. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n\nAffection for Mr. Biden runs deep, especially among older voters and with traditional Democratic constituencies such as organized labor and African-Americans. \u201cI\u2019d be comfortable having him come over and have potato soup with us,\u201d said Virginia Petersten, of Johnston, Iowa, who had just watched Mr. Biden speak for over an hour in Urbandale, Iowa.\n\nBeyond this potato soup primary, Mr. Biden\u2019s crowds have been undeniably smaller and less raucous than other top-tier candidates, namely Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders.\n\nIn a tour of about a dozen of these campaign events across the early-voting states during the second half of August, Mr. Biden\u2019s audiences were moderately enthusiastic, always polite and certainly appreciative of his visits. Given their revulsion for the incumbent, many attendees expressed gratitude that Mr. Biden was running for president. But they struggled to identify why he was running, or what the former vice president represented beyond a known and decent entity who was not Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cIf I were in his shoes, I don\u2019t know if I felt I had a whole lot more to achieve in life,\u201d Ryan Comstock , of Urbandale, said of Mr. Biden\u2019s motivation after a campaign event. Mr. Comstock, who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, said he would likely participate in the Democratic caucuses next year. On Mr. Biden, he added, \u201cpart of me wants to think that he cares that much about America.\u201d", "description": "On certain days, Biden 2020 can feel more like a dutiful slog than the last march of a happy warrior.", "authors": ["Mark Leibovich"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/03/us/00biden-why-1/00biden-why-1-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg"}
