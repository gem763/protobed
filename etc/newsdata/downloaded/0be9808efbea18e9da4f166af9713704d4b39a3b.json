The officers immediately arrested him and he was charged for bribery.\"\n\nThe Pretoria Regional Court found him guilty this week and handed him a four-year imprisonment term, wholly suspended for five years on condition that he is not convicted of the same offence.\n\n\"This is a demonstration that some of our traffic officers are no longer interested in having their good name tarnished by motorists who are not prepared to obey the rules of the road,\" RTMC chief executive Makhosini Msibi said.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
