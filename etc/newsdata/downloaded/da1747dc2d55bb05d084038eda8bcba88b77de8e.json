I hoped that they would cease of their own accord.\u201d\n\nThe titles that irritated him included \u201cBunn Wackett Buzzard Stubble and Boot\u201d, apparently a spoof legal firm, which came to be shortened to Bunwackett. The show, meanwhile, had the working title The Circus. Now, though, Mills had had enough: \u201cThe time has come when we must stop having peculiar titles and settle on one overall title \u2026 Please would you have words with them and try to produce something palatable?\u201d\n\nFollowing this intervention, a title was finally agreed upon: Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus. And on 19 September 1969, BBC North sent an invitation to journalists to go on location for the filming of the show at the Cow and Calf pub on Ilkley Moor. They were promised \u201ccrazy antics\u201d and \u201cthe first opportunity to see this new-style brand of late-night nutty comedy in action, and all its writer-stars: John Cleese, Terry Jones, Eric Idle, Graham Chapman and Michael Palin.\u201d (As would often be the case, the animator Terry Gilliam was omitted, though he played many on-screen roles, and his brutal cartoons were the show\u2019s signature innovation.)\n\nThis memo and press release are among the documentation relating to the premiere, exactly 50 years ago, of Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus. Until exhumed by a researcher, the creative entrails of old BBC shows are buried in pink folders, hole-punched and tied with green bootlaces. Now, a rare peek inside the binders has uncovered all the secrets of the Pythons\u2019 earliest days.\n\nThe archive is especially important for this show. The Pythons included a prolific diarist \u2013 Palin has published three hefty volumes already \u2013 but, dismayingly, the months around the start of the first Python show are one of the longest gaps. Palin attributes this to the busy-ness of filming, and having a young child and ailing elderly father.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The minister for silly walks \u2026 Cleese in Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus. Photograph: Allstar/BBC\n\nPresumably following calculations on some abacus of celebrity value, accounts initially paid Cleese \u00a367 per show more than the others, Palin \u00a31 less than Jones and Chapman, and Idle \u00a32 less. Gilliam, an artist rather than \u201cartiste\u201d, was contracted separately.\n\nAlthough comic weirdness had been introduced to the BBC by The Goon Show, Monty Python went even further. BBC production teams may have sensed something odd was coming from the paperwork: a requisition form to the props department asks for a \u201cselection of bras (6), panties (6), and tights (5)\u201d and \u201c1 swastika flag, approx 4\u2019 x 2.6\u201d. A list of extras for a filming day includes, after one name, the specification \u201cno pigeon on shoulder\u201d (parrots, on shoulders and flat on their perch, would become a Python speciality). A handwritten note asks: \u201cWhat about topless on fountain?\u201d\n\nMost surreally, on 9 September, the show\u2019s producer John Howard Davies sent a memo to Bernard Wilkie in visual effects requesting \u201c1 copy of Turner\u2019s \u2018Fighting Temeraire\u2019 \u2026 in a detachable frame, which can be broken off and eaten \u2013 with two eatable refill frames\u201d.\n\nLater the same day, Wilkie\u2019s assistant returned the request with the note: \u201cUnfortunately \u2026 all edible props must be obtained through the Catering Manager.\u201d\n\nWhile the head of comedy had persuaded the team to pick a title, he could not persuade them to take editorial procedures seriously. The Pythons wanted to caption the first episode \u201cprogramme two\u201d, a joke the corporation chose to ignore. They also described their show as \u201cdesigned to subdue the violence in us all with gentle sick laughter\u201d. This was not passed on to the press, though the misleading subtitle \u201cWither Canada?\u201d was \u2013 which some newspaper previews reproduced unquestioningly.\n\nHaving survived the threat of a strike by BBC staff over the controversy that the new comedy show was replacing a late-night religious programme \u2013 the corporation cleverly argued that the devotional show was shifted to spare clergymen a late night on their busiest day \u2013 Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus was first transmitted at 22:50 on 5 October 1969.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trail-blazers \u2026 Monty Python. Photograph: Alamy\n\nA memo sent between senior executives reveals that the first episode achieved 1.5 million viewers with an audience appreciation (based on a small number of viewers paid to value what they watched) of 45 (out of 100). In comparison, the Rolf Harris Show (though in a primetime slot, and with a presenter then seen as a lovable family entertainer, rather than the convicted sex offender he later became) attracted 11 million viewers and a 64 enjoyment score.\n\nThe public response, at least from the correspondence archived by the BBC, seems to have been positive. The fan letters are a rarity, in that they immediately mimic and celebrate the tone of the Pythons. What seems to be a furious letter from a wing commander (retired), complaining about the \u201clong-haired louts\u201d making fun of the flying machines that won the Battle of Britain, is revealed to be written by a 16-year-old called Philip.\n\nAnother viewer called Rufus writes in the guise of an expert in the art or sport of \u201cblack pudding bending\u201d. A gentleman from Tunbridge Wells is not outraged, in line with the local stereotype, but engaged, repeatedly sending handwritten sketches that are politely declined on the grounds that the Pythons write all their own material.\n\nWhile Cleese has latterly attracted a reputation for irascibility, he is caught out in the files in a gesture of striking kindness. A Kent schoolboy called Doug Holman writes, asking for tickets to a recording. Cleese arranges for a pair to be sent. Doug, boldly, writes back, saying he is part of a large group of friends who want to go. Cleese contacts the BBC to request a further 14 tickets, suggesting that the young will be \u201cgood laughers\u201d.\n\nGiven the passage of five decades, many of the early Python audience have joined the choir invisible with the programme\u2019s late parrot. But I tracked down a Doug Holman who grew up in Kent and is now 69, running a business in Hampshire. My email rapidly received the reply: \u201cIt\u2019s a fair cop! Hearty congratulations on your detective work.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Continually going over the edge of what is acceptable\u2019 \u2026 the Pythons. Photograph: Allstar/BBC\n\nIn 1969, he was an electronics student at Portsmouth University, and an obsessive fan of the radio show I\u2019m Sorry I\u2019ll Read That Again, starring Cleese. Noticing a poster in the student union advertising the comedian as guest speaker, Holman went and saw Cleese deliver a \u201cverbal assault on British Rail [he had arrived late] and BBC bureaucracy\u201d, before inviting the students to write to him if they wanted tickets for a recording of I\u2019m Sorry I\u2019ll Read That Again.\n\nThen, \u201calmost as an afterthought,\u201d Holman remembers, \u201che handed round a few copies of scripts for \u2018a new, as yet untitled, TV show\u2019 he was hoping would be commissioned. The copy I saw included strange references to things like exploding knees, but I confess the general reaction was one of polite perplexity.\u201d\n\nHolman wrote off for tickets to the radio show but, some days later, \u201cmy sister rushed into the kitchen blurting out: \u2018It\u2019s \u2026 John Cleese ... from the BBC ... for Doug!\u2019 Cleese explained that sadly, there would be no new series of ISIRTA that year, before asking whether I\u2019d be interested in tickets for the new TV show? In the heat of the moment, I suggested: \u2018How about four; that\u2019s four car-loads?\u2019 That\u2019s why the number of tickets increased from two to 16.\u201d\n\nThe BBC response, the archives make clear, was far less positive. At the weekly meeting where senior managers discussed the output, the head of factual had found Python \u201cdisgusting\u201d, arts had thought it \u201cnihilistic and cruel\u201d, while religion objected to a Gilliam animation in which \u201cJesus \u2026 had swung his arm\u201d. The BBC One controller sensed the makers \u201ccontinually going over the edge of what is acceptable\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Early days \u2026 Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus. Photograph: Allstar/BBC/Sportsphoto Ltd.\n\nIn yet another sign of internal disapproval, the Pythons were commissioned to provide material for the 1969 Christmas Night with the Stars, the BBC end-of-year jamboree, but a brisk memo rejects their sketch.\n\nThe archives also reveal an undertow of tension with the TV presenter and producer, David Frost. On 20 April 1969, while the first series is in pre-production, the writer-performer Barry Took, then a consultant for the BBC, warns Mills, the head of comedy: \u201cJohn Cleese phoned today to say that he is still under contract to Paradine Productions, who want to be involved in The Circus project as a co-production.\u201d\n\nFrost, only 30 but already a formidable TV impresario, owned Paradine (which was called after his middle name). Took reports that, if the BBC will not co-operate with Frost, Cleese will withdraw from The Circus. He recommends that the BBC produce a series with \u201cPalin, Jones, Idle and cartoon inserts from Terry Gilliam\u201d, then revive the idea of The Circus in 1971, when Cleese becomes free.\n\nThere is always a moment when what is now a classic comes perilously close to not happening; this was Python\u2019s. The files do not reveal how the BBC saw off Frost, but the corporation seems to have played hard-ball.\n\nI am very unhappy that all the regions are opting out of the new series\n\nIn another intrusion of real-life surreality into the Python story, the postmaster general at the time was John Stonehouse, who would soon afterwards fake his death by leaving his clothes on a beach in Miami, and was subsequently arrested by police officers who thought he was Lord Lucan, another prominent disappeared Briton of the era. Stonehouse was jailed for fraud, and revealed as a Czechoslovakian secret agent. Having censured Python over the Frost incident, he later inspired another major BBC comedy series: The Rise and Fall of Reginald Perrin, in which David Nobbs\u2019 hero pretends to have drowned in a swimming accident.\n\nOn 11 August 1970, having commissioned a second run of Python, Mills laments in a memo to the BBC hierarchy: \u201cI am very unhappy that all the regions are opting out of the new series.\u201d The team had become victim to another BBC continuity announcement trope they liked to satirise: \u201cExcept for viewers in Scotland/Northern Ireland/Wales.\u201d\n\nBut these rejections \u2013 and many memos reporting Cleese\u2019s reluctance to make another series \u2013 could not prevent the Pythons going on to conquer TV, cinema (Holy Grail, Life of Brian) and stage.\n\nFive decades after a 19-year-old student struck the audacious free-ticket deal immortalised in the BBC archives, Holman still energises his memories of the recording: \u201cThere was a restaurant scene but I think the producer abandoned it when Cleese \u2013 seemingly unhappy about having no lines \u2013 disrupted each take by performing random Tourette-like impressions of a mouse being strangled by a psychotic cat. I remember it being total anarchy yet excruciatingly funny, in the literal sense. We all experienced genuine pain from extended bouts of uncontrollable laughter.\u201d\n\n", "description": "In this rare glimpse inside the BBC archives, we reveal the exasperated internal memos, the furious letters from wing commanders \u2013 and David Frost\u2019s bid to bring them down", "authors": ["Mark Lawson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b738be1eeee2da943eb68e302e489c3d54948c23/11_0_1395_837/master/1395.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=10b80b26e131cbe80b0cf3758aee6cfa", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
