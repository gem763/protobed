Instead of welcoming worshipers or offering information on church service times, the church\u2019s double-sided sign delivers a punch. One side diagnoses black Trump voters as mentally ill \u2013 and the other side declares that white Trump voters are racist.\n\nNew Era Baptist Church Pastor Michael Jordan talks about his controversial message https://t.co/Gu0HONIphP \u2014 WVTM 13 (@WVTM13) August 27, 2019\n\nThe church is located in Birmingham, Alabama and Pastor Jordan is African-American. His message is, \u201cPlease do not vote for Donald Trump.\u201d He told a local reporter that if a black voter \u201cbelieves in equality, who believe in the redistribution of wealth, who believe in earned income equality\u201d and votes for Trump, the voter is suffering from mental illness. Jordan calls President Trump a racist and a bigot and bashes his administration, too.\n\nJordan says he has been the church\u2019s pastor for 27 years. If you click on the tweet and listen to all of the video clip you will hear that the pastor gets some facts wrong but his message is clear, especially as he calls the president a Klu Klux Klansman, for example. He is interrupted by a young white man who asks if he knows he is violating federal law with his political message. He goes on to read the tax code for tax-exempt churches. The young man also takes credit for the reporter being there interviewing Pastor Jordan. Apparently, he reported the sign to the local news outlet. Pastor Jordan calls the young man a bigot and a \u201cKlu Klux Klan descendant\u201d. Yikes.\n\n\u201cGod motivates me to take a stand. We have normalized racism\u201d, Jordan tells the reporter when asked why he is creating such a controversy. The video devolves into the pastor, two black men, and the white man yelling at each other over racism. One black man says he isn\u2019t a Trump voter but the church sign\u2019s message is racist and wrong. It all gets pretty tedious. Clearly no minds are changing during the dialogue.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough the liberties that politicians have taken as they campaign in churches and are given opportunities to speak during church services. It is equally bad for a pastor to promote his own political agenda to the public. Surely this is a violation of the tax code and the tax-exempt status of this church should be reviewed.\n\nGuess who really likes this ugly divisive speech? Hollywood\u2019s Debra Messing. She is one of the stars of Will and Grace. Not only did she weigh in with her agreement that Trump supporters must be outed by The Hollywood Reporter after fellow cast member Eric McCormack tweeted his demand for a return of McCarthyism in Hollywood, but she jumped right on this controversy, too. After the Chairman of the Democratic Coalition (We help run #TheResistance) and former Obama campaign chairman tweeted about the church\u2019s sign, Messing chimed in.\n\nThe left is so sensitive that any difference of opinion is simply not tolerated. The election of President Trump broke many people and Trump Derangement Syndrome is alive and well as we approach the 2020 presidential election. I don\u2019t recall these kinds of stories when the previous administration enforced border security laws or deported millions of people during their time in office.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s administration has created an atmosphere for economic success across the board, across all demographics. African-American unemployment is at an all-time low. The same goes for Hispanic employment and youth employment. Criminal justice reform directly affects incarcerated African-Americans. Trump has reached out to minority voters more than past Republican candidates did. Remember when he asked \u201cWhat the hell do you have to lose?\u201d of black voters?\n\nNo one thinks the majority of African-American voters will change party loyalty. Democrats have kept their support for decades with divisive rhetoric because it benefits the party. Without African-American voters, Democrats cannot win elections. Pastor Jordan is using a very old Democratic playbook in a political cycle. He deflects his racist views onto someone else, in this case the President of the United States. This isn\u2019t the first time the pastor has shown his own racism.\n\n\u201cGod motivates me to take a stand for what\u2019s right,\u201d New Era Baptist Church\u2019s pastor, Michael Jordan, told WTVM 13. \u201cRead the Bible. And look in the White House. If they\u2019re calling me a racist, look in the White House. This isn\u2019t the first time that Jordan has used the church\u2019s signage to speak out. In 2018, after a suburban megachurch planned to open a satellite in Birmingham to combat crime, Jordan erected a sign that read \u201cBlack folks need to stay out of white churches.\u201d The sign sparked a social media outrage and earned a rebuke from Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin (D).\n\nIf Pastor Jordan doesn\u2019t think black folks should worship in white churches, I wonder what kind of litmus test he uses for the political affiliation of his church flock. It sure sounds like he is consumed with political ideology at the expense of religious doctrine.", "description": "\"A white vote for Trump is pure racism.\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Trump715FreedomFaithRallyDC7-1-17.jpg"}
