U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday the U.S. and Turkey struck a cease-fire in Syria that would last 120 hours, and allow Kurdish fighters to withdraw from a safe zone area.\n\nThe move for prices following the news \u201cdoes seem counterintuitive,\u201d Marshall Steeves, energy markets analyst at IHS Markit, told MarketWatch. \u201cThe Turkish incursion hadn\u2019t taken oil production off the market, so the peace agreement isn\u2019t directly impactful.\u201d\n\nStill, \u201cthere was some disappointment when the market failed to follow-through to the downside\u201d following data showing large crude stock builds, in addition to U.S. crude production remaining at a record, he said.\n\nEarlier news that U.K. and European Union leaders announced a tentative Brexit deal was supportive for oil prices, though the pact must be approved by the British parliament and other EU member states. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces a tough task in winning approval.\n\nThe unexpected announcement provided a lift for assets perceived as risky, including European equities and U.S. benchmark stock indexes.\n\nOil prices had traded mostly lower shortly after the Energy Information Administration on Thursday reported that U.S. crude supplies climbed for a fifth week in a row, by 9.3 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 11. Data were released a day late because of Monday\u2019s U.S. Columbus Day holiday.\n\nCrude supplies were forecast to increase by 4 million barrels, according to analysts polled by S&P Global Platts. The American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday reported a climb of 10.5 million barrels, according to sources.\n\n\u201cInventories have built by a whopping 9.3 million barrels, led by the refinery utilization rate dropping to its lowest since hurricane Harvey in September 2017,\u201d said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData.\n\n\u201cA release of 1.3 million barrels from the [Strategic Petroleum Reserve] has only rubbed salt into the wounds of the bulls, adding to today\u2019s crude build,\u201d he said. \u201cOne saving grace for the bulls is that the drop to such a lowly level of refining activity has helped to encourage solid draws to both gasoline and distillate inventories.\u201d\n\nThe EIA data showed supply declines of 2.6 million barrels for gasoline and 3.8 million barrels for distillates. The S&P Global Platts survey showed expectations for supply decreases of nearly 1.8 million barrels for gasoline and 2.6 million barrels for distillates.\n\nOn Nymex, November gasoline RBX19, -0.24% fell 0.1% to $1.6225 a gallon, while November heating oil HOX19, -0.10% rose 0.3% at $1.9481 a gallon.\n\n\u201cThe buildup in U.S. stockpiles comes amid broader concerns of slowing global demand, as U.S.-China trade tensions continue to take a toll on the world-wide economy,\u201d Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM, told MarketWatch. \u201cWith U.S. crude production holding at record highs, the onus appears to be on OPEC+ members to trigger deeper supply cuts, with any hopes of giving oil prices a sustained lift,\u201d he said, referring to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its oil-producer allies.\n\nMeanwhile, natural-gas futures settled with a gain after the EIA on Thursday reported that domestic supplies of natural gas rose by 104 billion cubic feet for the week ended Oct. 11. That was a bit lower than the average build of 108 billion cubic feet expected by analysts polled by S&P Global Platts.\n\nNovember natural gas NGX19, +0.00% rose 1.5 cents, or 0.7%, to $2.318 per million British thermal units.", "description": "Oil futures finish higher on Thursday, as U.S. and Turkey reached an agreement for a cease-fire in Syria easing tensions in the Middle East, and a tentative...", "authors": ["Myra P.
