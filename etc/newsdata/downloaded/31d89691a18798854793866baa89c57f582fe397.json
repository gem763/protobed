We do it for ourselves and our children,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, his North Macedonian counterpart, Zoran Zaev, urged EU leaders on Thursday to \"not put out the bright star we are striving for.\"\n\n\"We have worked hard and we are ready to work even harder and to face all the challenges that come with the process,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\n'Endless soap opera'\n\nBut EU membership negotiations can only be launched following a unanimous decision from the bloc's leaders.\n\nFrance has been the most vocal opponent with European Affairs Minister Amelie de Montchalin telling reporters on Monday following a meeting in Brussels that the bloc should not enter \"the endless soap opera\" of accession talks until it has reformed its vetting procedure.\n\nAn EU diplomat confirmed to Euronews that Denmark and Netherlands were both in favour of opening talks with North Macedonia only.\n\nAs such, they are in opposition to the majority of EU countries.\n\n\"There are many countries that want to join the EU, and this is great, but we need to have strong rules for this process,\" said Denmark's prime minister, Mette Frederiksen.\n\n\"I also think there is a difference in the preparedness of North Macedonia and Albania to join the EU. Our discussion last night suggested that they should move forward together in the accession talks.\"\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel told her parliamentarians on Thursday that the bloc should \"keep its promises\" and open talks.\n\n\"A European prospect is the best way to ensure rule-of-law developments in the two Western Balkan states and thus the best way to ensure prosperity and security within Europe,\" she said.\n\nPoland's representation in the EU stated on Friday that it \"would be a mistake\" to not launch membership talks as \"North Macedonia and Albania have done what was expected of them at this stage\".\n\n\"Much is said about the European values and thus it is important for the EU to keep its credibility here,\" it added.\n\nEU Council President Donald Tusk, Parliament chief David Sassoli, current and incoming Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Ursula von der Leyen, also all came out in favour.\n\nIn a joint letter released earlier this month, they wrote that \"if the EU is to uphold its international role and protect its interests, taking a step towards integrating those European countries that have expressed an interest and have fulfilled the requirements for starting the accession process will help achieve this\".\n\nThey also highlighted that \"North Macedonia and Albania did what we asked them to do. Achieving that required a significant effort from their citizens, for whom the European perspective has been a great source of motivation and determination.\"", "description": "Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama told Euronews on Friday that his country is \"collateral damage\" in an intra-EU power struggle.", "authors": ["Alice Tidey"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/20/30/1000x563_cmsv2_467846bd-789b-52a4-ab14-61f4e0dfb293-4242030.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
