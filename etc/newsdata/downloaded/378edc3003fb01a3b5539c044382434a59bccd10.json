Is this one better for cooking or finishing? Should I stick to Italian oils, or try Californian, Greek, or Spanish? Is there such a thing as a good and cheap olive?\n\nExperts will tell you that buying olive oil (that is, extra-virgin olive oil) really comes down to personal preference, and finding your favorite is all about experimenting. Try enough oils and you\u2019ll start to notice different flavor profiles \u2014 like piquant, peppery, mild, grassy, fiery \u2014 and which one you like best. But there are still a few easy ground rules to follow: Look for dark or opaque bottles, because olive oil doesn\u2019t like light. Read the label to learn the country \u2014 or countries \u2014 of origin, the harvest date, and to make sure it\u2019s truly \u201cextra virgin\u201d (\u201cpure,\u201d \u201clight,\u201d or just \u201colive oil\u201d are not substitutes for EVOO). Richard Rea, the executive chef at the Butcher\u2019s Daughter, also suggests looking for the certifications from either the NAOOA (North American Olive Oil Association) or its European counterpart, IOC (International Olive Council.)\n\nPeople like to compare olive oil to wine, but there\u2019s one massive difference: \u201cOlive oil does not benefit from age at all,\u201d says Nancy Harmon Jenkins, author of Virgin Territory: Exploring the World of Olive Oil. Olive oil only lasts for about 18 months. If you\u2019re worried that your oil has gone bad, food writer Kimberly Stewart has an easy test: \u201cRancid oil smells like children\u2019s Play-Doh,\u201d she says, \u201cor mouse urine.\u201d And on that note, we spoke to Jenkins, Stewart, and eleven other chefs, importers, and food writers about the best extra-virgin olive oils to use for any occasion.\n\nBest overall olive oil\n\nCalifornia Olive Ranch Extra Virgin Olive Oil Five of our EVOO experts mentioned this California Ranch olive oil as a pantry go-to. Jenkins calls it a good beginner olive oil that\u2019s affordable, versatile, and available in three different flavors for everyday use. All the flavors have also been certified by the California Olive Oil Council. Stewart, the author of Eating Between the Lines, also uses California Olive Ranch often and noted that the producers manage to maintain the quality of the oil while keeping the price fairly low. Anna Hezel, senior editor at Taste and the author of Lasagna: A Baked Pasta Cookbook, calls it a \u201cdependable, mild olive oil to add richness to a tomato sauce or to fry some eggs in.\u201d Danielle Oron, author of Food You Love But Different, likes California Olive Ranch EVOO for roasting or grilling vegetables, broiling salmon, and making a quick vinaigrette. Oron says it\u2019s a great option when she doesn\u2019t \u201cwant the oil to overpower the flavor of the dressing.\u201d And Mailea Weger, the chef and owner of caf\u00e9 and natural wine bar Lou in Nashville, who told us she grew up in California and started her career in the state, is also a fan. $14 at Amazon Buy $10 at Walmart Buy\n\nBest olive oil for finishing\n\nTenuta Di Capezzana Extra Virgin Olive Oil (2 Bottles) But if you\u2019re looking for an oil to drizzle over your food for added flavor, this one from Tuscany is your best bet. It came recommended by two of the experts we consulted \u2014 Jenkins and Erin Shambura, the owner and chef at Fausto in Brooklyn. Jenkins told us that Tuscan EVOO \u201cis the best oil in the world,\u201d and that Tenuta di Capezzana, which is produced outside Florence, is her go-to. Shambura describes it as having \u201ca buttery, mild flavor and a peppery finish. It has a nice balance of fruit and bitter with an earthy aroma,\u201d she says. Shambura recommends using this oil for roasted or grilled meat, and on hearty vegetables and mushroom dishes. $47 at Amazon Buy $47 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) olive oil for finishing\n\nOlio Verde Oil Olive Extra Virgin $32 (was $34, now 6% off) If you\u2019re looking for an affordable oil for an easy drizzle, Shambura says Olio Verde is a great choice with a mild flavor and less bitter notes. It\u2019s a single-origin Sicilian oil made with Nocellara del Belice olives. (\u201cNoce\u201d in Italian means walnut, so look out for a nutty flavor.) $32 at Amazon Buy $32 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest non-California USA-made olive oil\n\nGeorgia Olive Farms, Extra Virgin Olive Oil After California, Georgia is one of the largest U.S. producers of olive oil. This EVOO from the Southern state comes recommended by both Joey Ward, the executive chef and owner of Atlanta\u2019s Southern Belle and Georgia Boy restaurants, and David Bancroft, the executive chef and partner of Acre restaurant in Auburn, Alabama. Ward recently visited the family-run farm where it\u2019s made and pressed some himself. He says it has a \u201cvery bright and peppery, robust flavor,\u201d and claims that \u201cit goes toe to toe with the Italian, Greek, and California oil producers.\u201d Bancroft, the 2017 winner of Food Network\u2019s Iron Chef Showdown, told us it\u2019s his go-to at home and at work, saying he loves \u201cthe bright aromatics from Georgia-grown arbequina olives. The flavor has a subtle hint of green banana.\u201d $37 at Amazon Buy $37 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest multi-use olive oil\n\nMonini Extra Virgin Olive Oil For daily use, Shambura recommends the medium-bodied Italian Monini Extra Virgin Olive Oil. It has a fruity, grassy flavor, and can be used for both drizzling and for cooking meats, vegetables, and sauces, making it super versatile. $21 at Amazon Buy $21 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest olive oil for snacking\n\nZoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil Oron loves this EVOO, which is cold pressed from Spanish Cornicabra olives, giving it what she calls its \u201crich and fruity flavor and the most beautiful color.\u201d Oron likes it so much she mostly uses it as a condiment for various snacks. She drizzles it on crudit\u00e9s, bowls of homemade hummus, and for dipping torn pieces of baguette to enjoy while she cooks. Oron also told us she uses Partanna EVOO for the same purpose when she can find it. $25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest flavored olive oil\n\nAgrumato Lemon Extra Virgin Olive Oil (200 ml) Produced in the Abruzzo region in southern Italy, the Agrumato Lemon Olive Oil is another favorite of Shambura\u2019s. As the name suggests, the oil has a lemony aroma. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique product because the olives and lemons are crushed simultaneously,\u201d she says. Drizzle this oil on cooked fish, white meat, crudos, and vegetables. $27 at Amazon Buy $27 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest olive oil for salads\n\nMarchesi de Frescobaldi Laudemio Extra Virgin Olive Oil Underscoring what our experts already said about how the quality of Tuscan olive oils is hard to beat, James Beard Award\u2013winning chef Jonathan Waxman recommends this oil from the region\u2019s famous Frescobaldi estate, which he says is great for salads with seafood and vegetables. Though the color of the olive oil is not an indication of taste or quality, the bright-green liquid of Frescobaldi Laudemio is definitely eye-catching. $44 at Amazon Buy $44 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest status-y olive oil\n\nBrightland 100% Extra Virgin Heirloom Olive Oil According to Hezel, \u201ceveryone in food media seems to be totally nuts for Brightland olive oil.\u201d The California company was started by Aishwarya Iyer, who left her venture capital job to create better olive oil made in small batches sustainably using nothing but olives \u2014 cold-pressed single origin heirloom olives to be exact. Each glass bottle (the design of which was inspired by Matisse cutouts) is UV-powder coated to protect the precious contents inside and marked with a harvest date so you know it\u2019s fresh (not all brands do that). Plus it\u2019s sold at a handful of status-y retailers including Food52, Nordstrom, Goop, and Terrain. $38 for 2 at Food52 Buy $37 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nBest olive oil when you need it in two hours\n\nJust FreshDirect Organic 100% Italian Extra-Virgin Olive Oil Supermarket EVOO brands tend to get a bad reputation, but the next time you need a quick fix, food writer Hannah Howard suggests FreshDirect\u2019s brand. The online shopping site has an Italian organic olive oil for everyday purposes, as well as an early harvest EVOO from Sicily that\u2019s available only for limited periods. $18 at FreshDirect Buy\n\nBest olive oil to buy in bulk\n\nKirkland Signature Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil \u201cDon\u2019t laugh,\u201d Oron told us when she mentioned Kirkland Signature Organic EVOO as one of her favorites. \u201cI go through a lot of EVOO.\u201d The company we like for its great basic white T-shirts is also a surprisingly solid purveyor of USDA organic olive oil, which is bottled in Italy with oils from Italy, Portugal, and Spain. $41 for 2 at Amazon Buy $41 for 2 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Italian olive oil (that isn\u2019t from Tuscany)\n\nPianogrillo Extra Virgin Olive Oil Italian olive oils are widely used around the world, and there are a lot of them, so we asked Beatrice Ughi, founder and president of high-quality Italian food importer Gustiamo, for her recommendations. She picked Pianogrillo, which comes from the Ragusa province in Sicily, known for its excellent quality of oils. Compared to Tuscan olive oil, Sicilian EVOO tends to deliver a more forward flavor with bite, and less of the grassy voluptuousness notes found in the former. $38 at Amazon Buy $38 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Spanish olive oil\n\nO-Med Arbequina Extra Virgin Olive Oil Alex Raij, the chef and owner of New York City Spanish restaurants El Quinto Pino, Txikito, and La Vara, specializes in cuisine from the Basque region of Spain. She prefers olive oils that are \u201cgrassy and neutral, but not usually spicy,\u201d and recommends O-Med\u2019s 100 percent Arbequina olive oil with a low acidity. When trying out different olive oils, many experts suggest tasting the raw oil, but Raij has a different approach. \u201cThe true test of olive oil is on food. Floating in a soup or on bread, with a little bit of sea salt,\u201d she says. $23 at Amazon Buy $23 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Spanish olive oil for roasting meat\n\nNu\u00f1ez De Prado Extra Virgin Olive Oil Tin Nu\u00f1ez de Prado, which comes from the Andalusia region, is Waxman\u2019s recommendation for a Spanish oil. He uses this oil for roasting meat as well as for marinades. Zabar\u2019s, which sells the olive oil in New York, describes it as \u201cbright and fruity with just a hint of pepper and a smooth, sweet finish.\u201d $21 at Amazon Buy $21 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Greek olive oil\n\nGaea Fresh Olive Oil, Extra Virgin Greek oils don\u2019t get as much attention as Italian or Spanish ones, but Howard says this one is actually one of her favorite oils to use while cooking. At $23, it\u2019s cheap enough to cook with, but also good enough to drizzle on as a finishing oil, she says. It\u2019s pressed within three hours of harvest, and importantly, features the harvest date on the label. $26 at Amazon Buy $26 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Greek olive oil to buy in bulk\n\n\n\n\n\nTheros Extra Virgin Olive Oil Jacob Sessoms, the executive chef at Cultura in Asheville, North Carolina, prepurchases 50 gallons of this olive oil for his restaurant. He likes that the oil is a family affair: It\u2019s produced by Spiro Theros, a friend of his, and Spiro\u2019s son, Nikos. The father-son duo live in Asheville but make regular trips to Greece to press, package, and ship the oil from their family\u2019s plot. $99 for 6 at Theros Buy\n\nBest olive oil for gifting\n\nMiraval Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil It\u2019s not uncommon for wineries to get into the olive-oil business, and Miraval in Provence (which you might know as the winery bought by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who still own it, even after their separation) makes a beautiful bottle. Howard, who recently gifted a bottle to friends, says it\u2019s delicious enough that you can make a whole meal with just a bowl of this oil and some good bread. $60 at Amazon Buy $60 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest olive oil for special occasions\n\nIl Tratturello Extra Virgin Olive Oil Ughi recommends breaking out this 750ml bottle \u2014 a bit bigger than the standard half-liter \u2014 for special occasions (and as another giftable oil). The gorgeous bottle is emblazoned with a red wax seal and is individually numbered. \u201cIt gives you a sense of uniqueness,\u201d she says. Produced in Piani di Larino, in the Molise region of Italy, Ughi says it\u2019s one of her importing company\u2019s best sellers. $45 at Gustiamo Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
