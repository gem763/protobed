Erdogan wants to create a buffer zone there to keep Kurdish militants at bay and have a place to resettle Syrian refugees currently in Turkey.\n\nThe Turkish leader has been trying for months to get Trump to accede to his operation against the Kurds, who were U.S. allies in the fight against Islamic State. Top Trump advisers (some since departed) and the president himself had warned of the risks of abandoning the Kurds.\n\nErdogan\u2019s ability to win over Trump is remarkable, given growing frustration in Congress and the Pentagon with the Turkish leader\u2019s actions. So far, he\u2019s been able to evade threatened penalties over Ankara\u2019s purchase of a Russian missile-defense system and a multi-billion-dollar scheme to skirt sanctions on Iran.\n\nBut Trump also gets what he wants: Turkey\u2019s pledge to take responsibility for all Islamic State prisoners captured in the area.\n\nSo as he gears up for the 2020 election, he can tell his voter base that Islamic State doesn\u2019t pose a threat to the U.S. and America has now washed its hands of the whole Syrian mess.\n\nGlobal Headlines\n\nEnsemble piece | Trump faces new peril \u2014 and not just from the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. There are now at least two whistle-blowers coming forward to talk about his actions. It\u2019s unclear if the administration will let several witnesses speak to House panels this week as planned, and there are signs some Republican lawmakers are growing restive about what else might surface regarding Trump\u2019s requests of foreign leaders.\n\nRead how Trump's latest explanation for his July conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u2014 that he made the call at the behest of Energy Secretary Rick Perry \u2014 is undercutting a stalwart loyalist.\n\nNarrowed scope | Chinese officials are signaling increasing reluctance to agree to a broad trade deal with the U.S., ahead of talks this week that have raised hopes of a potential truce. Vice Premier Liu He said he\u2019d bring an offer to Washington that won\u2019t include commitments on reforming Chinese industrial policy or the government subsidies that have been the target of longstanding U.S. complaints, Shawn Donnan and Jenny Leonard report.\n\nSubscribe to Bloomberg\u2019s Terms of Trade newsletter to get the big developments each weekday.\n\nTaking notes | Democratic Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren made a mark with her \u201cI have a plan for that!\u201d slogan. But, on the crucial 2020 issue of health care, she\u2019s borrowing from rival and fellow progressive Bernie Sanders. Warren is the only one of the five top-polling Democrats without a sweeping proposal of her own.\n\nClick here for more on how Joe Biden is seeking to reassure his donors after a lackluster fund-raising quarter.\n\nEmpty-handed | North Korea left its first direct nuclear talks with the U.S. in eight months over the weekend discouraged by what it saw as an \u201cempty-handed\u201d offer, showing how far apart the two sides remain. More than a year of historic contact between leader Kim Jong Un and Trump that failed to lead to a deal to end Pyongyang\u2019s atomic weapons program.\n\nAMLO\u2019s party troubles | Since its formation five years ago, Mexico\u2019s ruling party, Morena, has revolved around one politician: Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who it helped propel to the presidency in a landslide victory last year. But now, as Eric Martin explains, ahead of Morena\u2019s first scheduled leadership contest, it\u2019s gripped by fierce infighting that will have a major impact on the 2021 mid-term election and the course of AMLO\u2019s government.\n\nWhat to Watch This Week\n\nWith just over three weeks until the Oct. 31 deadline, prospects for a Brexit deal have faded. European leaders signal they want progress by Friday. Violence in Iraq between security forces and protesters demonstrating against unemployment and corruption has killed about 100 people and left Adil Abdul-Mahdi with the biggest test of his short premiership. China\u2019s Xi Jinping and India\u2019s Narendra Modi will meet Friday and Saturday in India, with an agenda expected to include defense and trade issues, along with New Delhi\u2019s move to revoke Kashmir\u2019s autonomy, a decision Beijing has criticized. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa clinched a second term even as he faces stiffer economic headwinds. Tunisia is counting votes from yesterday\u2019s parliamentary elections, as an exit poll suggests the moderate Islamist Ennahda party will get the most ballots while falling short of a majority.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want to receive this post in your inbox every day?\u00a0Sign up\u00a0for the\u00a0Balance of Power\u00a0newsletter, and follow Bloomberg Politics on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for more.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan seems to be mastering the art of dealing\u00a0with Donald Trump.In a stunning policy reversal", "authors": ["Benjamin Harvey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eo9Da6y9EfqiWU0YDTSquA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/10fda8c3b09914c44d28c6371c6bd7b8", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
