In the previous 5Stars-League government, Di Maio served as deputy prime minister, economic development and labor minister as well as party leader.\n\n\"He had three different [sets of] staff and offices, he tried to do everything and he did everything very poorly,\" said one 5Stars lawmaker, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nLast week, Di Maio said he wasn't the subject of his colleagues' criticism and that internal discussions were natural.\n\nHowever, the group \u2014 whose names have not been made public but which, according to three 5Stars officials, includes senior party officials and former ministers \u2014 said that the party's structure should be overhauled and there should no longer be a single political leader.\n\nUnder the proposed structural changes outlined in their manifesto, Di Maio would have to step down and give way to territorial leadership groups elected by party activists.\n\nThe manifesto also calls for the ownership of the movement's online platform Rousseau \u2014 a direct democracy tool where party activists vote on policy and decide legislative action \u2014 to be transferred entirely to the party. Rousseau is currently fully owned and controlled by digital marketing consultant Davide Casaleggio.\n\n\"This is to ensure a maximum degree of transparency specifically on the oversight of online votes,\" said the manifesto.\n\nUnder the party's rules, 5Stars lawmakers are required to donate \u20ac300 a month for the platform's operation, but they are unable to manage it or access data relating to consultation votes.\n\nThis summer, Rousseau attracted criticism from analysts and the media because the 5Stars made a governing deal with the Democratic Party dependent on the platform's members voting in favor of the coalition.\n\nSpokespeople for Di Maio did not respond to requests for comment.", "description": "A group of lawmakers have called for a complete overhaul of the party\u2019s structure.", "authors": ["Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli", "Hannah Roberts"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1166989224-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
