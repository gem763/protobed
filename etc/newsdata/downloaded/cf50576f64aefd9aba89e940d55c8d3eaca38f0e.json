Our publications have been derided as violations of the Goldwater Rule, \u201carmchair psychiatry\u201d and political bias dressed up as professional opinions.\n\nBut, as mental health professionals, we have felt a duty to address a public health crisis: a mentally unfit person in charge of the world\u2019s most powerful military and its nuclear weapons. We have found ample evidence of his instability and grandiosity in the president\u2019s own words and public statements, most recently confirmed in his referring to \u201cmy great and unmatched wisdom,\u201d coupled with yet another threat to \u201c totally destroy and obliterate \u201d a foreign country.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s now familiar affinity for violence is manifest in his verbal threats and his incitement to violence at his rallies. He reacts viscerally and without reflection or consultation, now claiming \u201ctreason\u201d and an attempted \u201ccoup.\u201d As he confronts the humiliating prospect of impeachment, his psychological deterioration represents a clear and imminent risk.\n\nOur observations are not \u201cdiagnosing\u201d and do not refer to mental illness; rather, they speak to a lack of fitness that can be determined based on sufficient sources outside of a personal examination.", "description": "Three mental health professionals who contributed to \u201cThe Dangerous Case of Donald Trump\u201d cite recent actions that confirm their worries.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/opinion/09collinsWeb/09collinsWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
