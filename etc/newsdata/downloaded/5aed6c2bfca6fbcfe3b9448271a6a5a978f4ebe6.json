Package holidays that include a flight have Atol protection, those without may be covered by Abta, and credit cards offer alternative protection.\n\nBut Mr Young said the collapse of two large firms \u2013 Monarch two years ago and Thomas Cook last month \u2013 will make travellers ask: \u201cIs the holiday that I\u2019m purchasing protected, has it got Atol?\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m not going to buy a protected holiday then I should be booking flights with my credit card.\n\n\u201cIf they didn\u2019t know before, they certainly do now.\u201d\n\nDerek Moore, chairman of Aito, the specialist travel association, said that the latest failure showed that scale is not a guarantee of success: \u201cThink of Thomas Cook as a large fuel tanker. It can\u2019t adjust quickly. Smaller operators can adapt more quickly to adverse economic conditions.\u201d\n\nMany specialist travel firms used Thomas Cook Airlines to fly their clients, and are now looking for alternative carriers.\n\nMr Moore said that the aviation market will soon fill the gap: \u201cWe may see carriers we\u2019ve never heard of before, but as long as they have the right licences I don\u2019t have a problem with that.\u201d\n\nMark Tanzer, chief executive of Abta, said: \u201cThomas Cook\u2019s financial challenges were no secret, but the full extent of their indebtedness has only come to light recently.\u201d\n\nHis association is is calling on the government to bring in protection for flight-only purchases to match the cover provided by Atol.", "description": "The collapse of Thomas Cook will make holidaymakers think more carefully about consumer protection, travel industry leaders say.
