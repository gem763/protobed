The family has been closely linked to Epstein since Dubin dated Epstein in the 1980s, though they've attempted to distance themselves in recent months.\n\nIn an email obtained by The Times that Gates sent to colleagues after he met Epstein face-to-face for the first time, he noted that \"a very attractive Swedish woman and her daughter dropped by and I ended up staying there quite late.\"\n\nEpstein also reportedly met with teams from Gates' charity, pitching an idea that would involve seed money from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the bank JPMorgan Chase.\n\nFor more stories about Jeffrey Epstein, click here.\n\nNew details and documents obtained by The New York Times reveal a much closer connection between Bill Gates and the late Jeffrey Epstein than what the Microsoft founder had previously admitted.\n\nThe Times reported that the billionaire met with the disgraced financier at least three times. Epstein also hatched a plan with JPMorgan, which never came to fruition, to use Gates' foundation money for a charitable fund.\n\nGates spokeswoman Bridgitt Arnold told Business Insider in a statement that the men met \"multiple times\" to discuss philanthropy, but they did not socialize or attend parties together. She also said it appears that \"Epstein misrepresented the nature of his meetings with Gates while also working to insert himself behind-the-scenes without Gates's knowledge.\"\n\nShe did not say say how many times Gates and Epstein met.\n\n\"Bill Gates regrets ever meeting with Epstein and recognizes it was an error in judgment to do so,\" Arnold said. \"Gates recognizes that entertaining Epstein's ideas related to philanthropy gave Epstein an undeserved platform that was at odds with Gates' personal values and the values of his foundation.\"\n\nShe told Business Insider in August that, while Epstein aggressively pursued a relationship with Gates, \"any account of a business partnership or personal relationship between the two is categorically false.\"\n\nThe disgraced financier went to jail for 13 months starting in 2008 after he pled guilty to two counts of soliciting prostitution from underage girls in Palm Beach, Florida. The Times reports that the two first met face-to-face in January 2011 at Epstein's Manhattan residence, and that Gates visited the townhouse at least two more times, meeting him as late as 2013.\n\nFILE- In this July 30, 2008 file photo, Jeffrey Epstein appears in court in West Palm Beach, Fla.

Dubin, who once dated Epstein, and her billionaire hedge fund manager husband Glenn Dubin maintained close social, financial and philanthropic ties with Epstein, including after he went to jail. Six sources told Business Insider that Epstein was a godfather to their oldest daughter, which the family denies.\n\nSpokespeople for the Dubins have previously said the family spent less time with Epstein after he left jail in 2009, and if they had known about this year's allegations, they would have cut ties with him. Representatives for the Dubins declined to comment on Saturday about The Times' story.\n\nAfter the meeting, Epstein emailed friends and associates to boast, writing \"Bill's great\" in one email reviewed by The Times. In an email Gates sent to his own colleagues the next day, he wrote, \"A very attractive Swedish woman and her daughter dropped by and I ended up staying there quite late.\"\n\nEpstein hatched a plan to work with the Gates Foundation and JPMorgan, but it fizzled out years before his 2019 arrest\n\nA source close to Epstein told Business Insider that Epstein and Gates liked to talk about science and philanthropy together, and said their relationship preceded 2013. The source said Epstein liked to work with senior businessmen at the end of their careers, and that Epstein's dynamic personality often reminded those men of the son they wished they had, or even of themselves at a younger age.", "description": "The disgraced financier sought to work with JPMorgan and Gates' foundation on multiple funds, per the New York Times.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xdkiVey61ZPyeanVIpHt1A--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/c596f06194ae8c49bf85f3e9779044fa", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
