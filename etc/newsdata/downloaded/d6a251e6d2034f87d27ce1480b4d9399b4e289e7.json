Wentz\u2019s top two receivers, DeSean Jackson and Alshon Jeffrey, went down with respective calf and groin injuries early on.\n\n\u201cIt was tough,\u201d Wentz said. \u201cWe\u2019re by no means going to make excuses and we\u2019ve always talked next man up, but some of the stuff tonight you can\u2019t make up. I\u2019ve never seen guy after guy like that early in the ballgame, but guys stepped up. Guys were resilient. We came up a little short today, but I\u2019m proud of the way the guys fought.\u201d\n\nWentz didn\u2019t escape unscathed, taking a shot the ribs from linebacker Deion Jones on the first of his two interceptions and missing six snaps because he was in the sideline medical tent assuring officials he wasn\u2019t suffering from a concussion. He was sacked three times and hit 10 others.\n\nEnough frustration had piled up that Wentz spiked the football as hard as he could after running for a 1-yard touchdown that gave the Eagles their first and only lead of the game with 3:13 remaining.\n\n\u201cYou game plan all week and have all these personnel packages and then they kind of all go out the window on game day,\u201d Wentz said. \u201cBut the coaches do a great job, and guys were ready to step up.\u201d\n\nNelson Agholor took on a bigger role at wideout and caught eight of 11 targets for 107 yards and one TD. He also let the ball slip through his hands after he\u2019d beaten coverage near the left sideline on the final drive. It likely would\u2019ve been a 40-yard winning score. Agholor made some amends with a 43-yard catch a few snaps later, but time was about to run out\n\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ve still got to make that play,\u201d Agholor said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we prepared for in pregame. We were trying to track it in the light. I\u2019ve got to find a way to catch it all. Remember where it\u2019s going to be and look it all the way in.\u201d\n\nThe Eagles suffered other injuries, too. It\u2019s a pattern the team has gotten accustomed to in recent years.\n\nStarting defensive tackle Tim Jernigan had a foot injury in the third quarter, left the game and departed the locker room afterward in a boot. Cornerback Sidney Jones had a head injury but was cleared to return. Special teams player Corey Clement hurt his shoulder.\n\nAnd Philadelphia lost defensive tackle Malik Jackson to a likely season-ending foot injury early last week.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d right tackle Lane Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just bad luck. It sucks, especially when you have some really good talent out there that would make the game a whole lot better for you.\u201d\n\nWentz completed just eight of his first 20 attempts as the pocket collapsed often in the early going. He finally found his footing, though, and was able to mostly dodge the pass rush in the second half. He completed 25 of 43 passes for 231 yards and 4-yard score in the third.\n\nThe Eagles got no help from their running game with Miles Sanders, Jordan Howard and Wentz combining for a 2.3 average on 21 carries.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re down a lot of guys,\u201d center Jason Kelce said. \u201cObviously we didn\u2019t run as well as we wanted to, so kind of got one-dimensional for a little bit of it. I thought Carson did well. I think the whole offense could\u2019ve done better.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Carson Wentz kept losing receivers, but still did everything in his power to will the injury-depleted Philadelphia Eagles to one more score.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "George Henry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/eagles_falcons_football_04554_c0-189-4521-2824_s1770x1032.jpg?a1ad3eb6ad25005ac123018f52e18ecd08dac76a", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
