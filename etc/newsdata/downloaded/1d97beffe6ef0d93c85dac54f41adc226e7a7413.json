Saying that they\u2019re \u2018purely cosmetic\u2019 and have \u2018zero impact on gameplay\u2019 is entirely missing the point and is nothing but excusing what may be the games industry\u2019s dirtiest, most scummy business practice by far.\n\nMore often than not, stories about how kids spend thousands of pounds on games like Fortnite is a result of social pressure. Kids are actually getting bullied in playgrounds now because they can\u2019t afford the premium skins (unbelievably \u2018Default\u2019 has become an actual insult). I\u2019m not even a think of the children type, as loot boxes of any kind prey on anyone who\u2019s psychologically vulnerable and/or has an addictive personality.\n\nI know from experience that I\u2019d probably be one of those who spends all their money on loot boxes in a futile attempt to get a rare skin/card/whatever, which is why attitude\u2019s like Mark\u2019s (and GameCentral\u2019s cheering him on, I might add) are so downright offensive to me as it came across more to me like he just wanted to defend his favourite game, even if that isn\u2019t actually the case.\n\nIt sickens me that gamers can be so dismissive of how much of a scourge loot boxes really are whenever they\u2019re just cosmetic. When you consider there are people paid to state that getting people to spend money on microtransactions and loot boxes must become the socially-acceptable way to play, it\u2019s clear that loot boxes are pure poison regardless of their form and the industry is utterly spineless and unwilling to do anything about the problem.\n\nMore and more games these days behave both ethically and psychologically like gambling, actively destroying games they appear in by making them less fun to deliberately encourage microtransaction spending, and no reasonable person should stand for it. It\u2019s important that more stories like that in The Guardian turn up, keeping the pressure up to get rid of them or else the industry with sleaze their way out of what is currently a PR disaster for them.\n\nAndrew Middlemas\n\nGC: While that\u2019s all true we think the point he was making is that Fortnite, despite its position of influence, is one of the least manipulative of the major games, whereas equally popular titles such as FIFA are much worse. All of which implied the Guardian writer didn\u2019t really know what they were talking about.", "description": "The Thursday Inbox is glad that Nintendo has never gone third party, as one reader insists that all loot boxes are bad, even cosmetic ones.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gow_screen_deerkill_ps4_001_1465878040_1571875351.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
