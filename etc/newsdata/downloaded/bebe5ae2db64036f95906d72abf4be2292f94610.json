It's okay when you're alone, but as soon as there's chopping in the kitchen or an influx of cars driving by, you need to turn the volume all the way up so it's audible. I mean, how else are you going to guess who the Flamingo is on The Masked Singer?\n\nYou could get a new TV\u2014or you could just upgrade your current one with a soundbar. Even better, you can snag a great one for under $200 right now.\n\nThe Yamaha YAS-207BL Sound Bar typically sells for $230, but you can get it for just $170 on Amazon for today only. That's $60 in savings and an incredible price to seriously upgrade on the sound on your TV.\n\nThe YAS-207BL is an improved version of our runner-up in our roundup of the best soundbars under $200. We liked that it delivered a ton of features (treble and bass control, Bluetooth, Clear Voice, bass boost) in a slim, stylish bar that delivers great sound. It's also perfect for the technologically challenged. It has a seamless Bluetooth connection, and you simply control it from the bar or a remote to quickly swap between stereo and surround modes.\n\nThe YAS-207BL also includes an additional external subwoofer that will heighten the bass on your playlist or make the suspenseful music in the horror movie you're watching even more terrifying. For this low price (more so with this deal!), you're getting great basic features and sound that will enhance the viewing experience for every casual TV watcher or music listener.\n\nReminder: This deal is only good until today, so there's a very limited time to snag one for yourself\u2014or you'll be left paying full price tomorrow.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
