How dare you suggest something so corrupt? That\u2019s CNN for you, always imagining the worst about the president.\u201d\n\nInstead Navarro doggedly refuses to give a straight answer. How come? His excuse, that it\u2019s bad form to discuss what happens behind closed doors inside the White House, is nonsense on stilts. If Jim Sciutto had asked him instead whether, say, Trump is taking orders from Vladimir Putin, I\u2019m sure Navarro would have replied with some variation of \u201cNo, you Russia-obsessed media crank.\u201d\n\nNo comment in this case, though.\n\nHere's video of @jimsciutto asking Peter Navarro if political investigations about the Bidens have come up during China trade talks, and Navarro declining to answer. pic.twitter.com/uaev1O960s \u2014 Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) October 24, 2019\n\nThe best-case explanation for his reticence is that the Bidens haven\u2019t been mentioned during talks in which Navarro has been directly involved but he doesn\u2019t want to inch out on a limb by assuming that they\u2019ve never been mentioned by other negotiators. Who could blame him? Trump\u2019s relations with Ukraine involved not one but possibly two unofficial back channels. The president himself stood on the White House lawn a few weeks ago and remarked that China should take a look at Hunter Biden\u2019s business interests. Trump has also allegedly told Xi Jinping that he wouldn\u2019t criticize China over Hong Kong in order to make trade negotiations between the two sides run more smoothly. How hard is it to believe that he\u2019d request a concession unrelated to trade from China in return?\n\nSo that\u2019s the best-case scenario, that Navarro has no reason to believe the Bidens have come up but isn\u2019t confident enough in Trump\u2019s integrity to stake his own credibility on it. Whereas the worst-case scenario is that \u2026 they have come up and Navarro has first-hand knowledge. That another illicit quid pro quo aimed at generating dirt on the Democratic frontrunner is in the works even as Trump faces impeachment for the one with Ukraine. Which would fit a sort of pattern: Remember that his phone call to Zelensky on July 25th happened the day after Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony before Congress. The president isn\u2019t one to change his behavior just because watchdogs are sniffing around.\n\nIn fact, according to CNN, there\u2019s reason to believe that Trump has already spoken to Xi Jinping about the Bidens. From a report on October 3:\n\nDuring a phone call with Xi on June 18, Trump raised Biden\u2019s political prospects as well as those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who by then had started rising in the polls, according to two people familiar with the discussion. In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed. The White House record of that call was later stored in the highly secured electronic system used to house a now-infamous phone call with Ukraine\u2019s President and which helped spark a whistleblower complaint that\u2019s led Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2026 On Thursday, Trump told reporters at the White House he\u2019d consider asking his counterpart in Beijing to investigate the Bidens, adding to a growing list of foreign leaders he\u2019s tried to enlist in his attempts to bring down a potential Democratic challenger. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly something we can start thinking about,\u201d Trump said when questioned whether he would seek the help of Xi in investigating Biden. \u201cBecause I\u2019m sure that President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny.\u201d\n\nNote that it was Biden\u2019s \u201cpolitical prospects\u201d that allegedly came up between Trump and Xi, not \u201cfighting corruption\u201d or whatever. How hard is it to believe at this point that someone, whether Trump or a deputy, has communicated to the Chinese that if they want this trade war and the attendant pain to their economy to end, an investigation of Hunter Biden would be \u201chelpful\u201d?\n\nA Twitter pal makes an excellent related point. If it\u2019s true that the Bidens were raised by the U.S. side during trade talks, the Chinese now have tremendous leverage over Trump on the trade deal thanks to the uproar over Ukraine. They would obviously realize how explosive that information would be if it came out right now, possibly even putting Trump at risk of removal in the Senate once House Democrats added it to the articles of impeachment. It would prove that Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine weren\u2019t a one-off; if he\u2019s talking to China about the Bidens too, there\u2019s every reason to believe he\u2019ll continue to use his leverage over U.S. policy to squeeze foreign powers for dirt he can use against Democratic candidates during the election.\n\nNavarro must understand the implications. So why not just say, \u201cNo, of course we didn\u2019t discuss the Bidens,\u201d and move on?\n\nRight now Pelosi\u2019s watching this clip, wondering, \u201cAm I going to have to impeach this guy again six months from now when we find out there was a quid pro quo with China too?\u201d Better go nice and slow with that impeachment inquiry in the House.", "description": "No comment.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/c-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
