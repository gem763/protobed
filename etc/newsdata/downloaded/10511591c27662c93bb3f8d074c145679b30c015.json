REUTERS/Muhammad Hamed\n\nTUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisians began casting votes in an unpredictable presidential election on Sunday where there is no overwhelming front-runner, with the young democracy\u2019s economic ills dominating the agenda.\n\nPolling stations opened at 8am (0700 GMT) from the capital Tunis on the Mediterranean coastline to the cork forests of the northwest, the mining towns of the interior and sand-swept Saharan villages in the south.\n\nTunisia threw off autocratic rule eight years ago in a revolution that inspired \u201cArab Spring\u201d revolts in Egypt, Yemen, Bahrain, Libya and Syria, but it alone has enjoyed a smooth, peaceful transition to democracy.\n\nWhile foreign attention, especially in Arab countries, is focussed on the moderate Islamist Ennahda party, many Tunisians are watching the fate of media mogul Nabil Karoui, running from behind bars on suspicion of money laundering and tax evasion, which he denies.\n\nA court on Friday ruled he must stay behind bars after his arrest last month, leading his supporters to claim he has been silenced.\n\nPrime Minister Youssef Chahed, as well as two former prime ministers, a former president and the defence minister are also among the 26 candidates hoping to win outright or, if none of them win more than 50%, to advance to a second round run-off.\n\nTunisia\u2019s president has direct control over foreign and defence policy while most other portfolios are handled by a prime minister chosen by parliament.\n\nElections for the parliament will be held on October 6.", "description": "Tunisians began casting votes in an unpredictable presidential election on Sunday where there is no overwhelming front-runner, with the young democracy's economic ills dominating the agenda.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430025391&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E03D", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
