Vatican Media/Handout via REUTERS\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Director Fernando Meirelles is a fan of Pope Francis but says his new film, which tries to get into the head of the Argentine pontiff, also shows some of his weaknesses.\n\n\u201cThe Two Popes\u201d is based on the story of Pope Benedict\u2019s 2013 dramatic retirement from the papacy and the ascendancy of Pope Francis and imagines some of the conversations the two men might have had.\n\n\u201cI did the film because I\u2019m a big fan of Pope Francis. I think he\u2019s a very important voice in the world today,\u201d Meirelles said at the London film festival on Monday.\n\n\u201cHe sees the planet as one thing and he\u2019s trying to build bridges while everybody wants to build walls. So I decided to make the film to know him better and even to support what he says,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very honest. We show the mistakes that he\u2019s done some 30 years ago in Argentina. But in the end, he comes across like somebody we should support,\u201d the Brazilian filmmaker said.\n\nThe film, starring Anthony Hopkins as the traditional Pope Benedict and Jonathan Pryce as his more liberal successor, is set mostly in a movie set replica of the ornately decorated Sistine Chapel in the Vatican.\n\n\u201cIt was just such a great character to play, showing his flaws and his weaknesses as well as his very positive strengths and what he can do as a kind of leader which we desperately need in political life these days; someone who can show us the way and show us how to live and go back to the old Christian values,\u201d Pryce said.\n\nThe Netflix movie launches in U.S. movie theaters in late November and on the streaming service in December. It is not known whether it will be screened at the Vatican.\n\n\u201cIf he (Francis) sees it, I hope he is amused. I hope he isn\u2019t angry. And I hope he understands that what we\u2019ve tried to portray is the essence of the man and what he is trying to do,\u201d said Pryce.", "description": "Director Fernando Meirelles is a fan of Pope Francis but says his new film, which tries to get into the head of the Argentine pontiff, also shows some of his weaknesses.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438190215&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961KD", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
