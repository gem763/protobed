It was tongue-in-cheek and only meant for me, to make me feel better.\n\n\"So when I left my tablet on the kitchen table and caught Earl reading the poem in my memo app, I got a horrible sinking feeling.\u201d\n\n\"He went mad. We had a huge row and though I tried to explain it was only meant to be a laugh, I knew my words had hit him hard.\"\n\nBut now the 49-year-old has got his own back in the best possible way.\n\nConstruction worker Earl has shed a massive three stone in just three months while his daily workouts have left him with a rippling six-pack - and Bernie couldn't be happier.\n\n(Image: Julia Sidwell)\n\nBernie, who writes poetry to help her deal with stress, says she was provoked into writing the poem because of Earl's constant comments about her fluctuating weights throughout her two pregnancies.\n\nAnd it's had a hugely positive impact on Bernie too, who once tipped the scales at 16 stone.\n\nShe is now following her own healthy eating place and has lost a stone and a half\n\nEarl said: \"I can\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t a tad p***** off when I read Bern\u2019s poem, but everything happens for a reason.\n\n\"I suppose I have been a bit harsh in the past about her weight, but it was mostly for laughs.\n\n(Image: Julia Sidwell)\n\n\"Now we are motivating each other to be healthy and are definitely much happier.\"\n\nThe couple, who left Gloucestershire in 2016 to travel around Spain, had always had an intense and spontaneous marriage.\n\nBernie said: \"Two weeks after I met my husband Earl, we got each other\u2019s names tattooed on our wrists.\n\n\"We were married within 10 weeks, and I was expecting our first child just two weeks after that.\n\n\"Though our relationship was strong, my husband had always been vain and kept in shape, which meant he couldn\u2019t help picking on me and my weight.\n\n(Image: Julia Sidwell)\n\n\"It really bugged me - I had always battled with my body shape and was overweight before we met.\n\n\"I felt in pretty good shape throughout most of our relationship, but he still made mean comments, like \u2018I can see your belly through your top\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019re really bottom heavy\u2019.\n\n\"Thankfully I learnt not to take his cruel words to heart.\"\n\nWhen the pair travelled to Spain with their two kids, Caden, nine, and Frankie, six, Earl started eating and drinking to much.\n\nBernie said: \"He became podgy without even realising it, yet still had the cheek to call me fat.\n\n(Image: Julia Sidwell)\n\n\"So one day, while Earl was sprawled out on the sofa with his gut hanging out, I started tapping away on my iPad with a new diary entry.\"\n\nAfter Earl read her poem, Bernie admits she spent the next two days grovelling.\n\nShe said: \"I felt so guilty. But later that week he looked in the mirror and realised he\u2019d let himself go.\n\n\"He agreed he shouldn\u2019t have been criticising me when he was the one who\u2019d gained weight.\"\n\nFor the next three months, Earl became dedicated to eating healthily and exercising everyday, pushing himself to the limit and even entering a bodybuilding competition.\n\n(Image: Julia Sidwell)\n\n(Image: Julia Sidwell)\n\nBernie who had been yo-yo dieting for years joined her husband by changing what she ate and soon they were both dropping pounds.\n\nShe said: \u201cEarl always knew about my weight issues. Before we\u2019d met, a weakness for anything smothered in cheese resulted in me reaching 16 stone.\n\n\u201cI have never been that big since but I gained weight with both pregnancies and Earl made sure I knew about it.\n\n\"Every time I looked in the mirror I saw a fat person staring back at me.\n\n\"Earl on the other hand has always been a fitness freak and was as slim as they came. He\u2019d be the first to admit he\u2019s vain.\"\n\n(Image: Julia Sidwell)\n\n(Image: Julia Sidwell)\n\nIt was months after travelling to Spain that Bernie noticed the svelte, muscly man she had fallen in love with had let himself go.\n\nShe said: \u201cEarl\u2019s love of beer and greasy tapas dishes had turned his abs to flab, without him even realising it.\n\n\"I was secretly pleased. It had always been Earl picking on me, but now he was the one with the spare tyre.\"\n\nAfter Earl decided to get in shape, Bernie took \u2018before\u2019 photos of him.\n\nThen he started working out by hiking up mountains and running miles to the next town, carrying weights in his backpack.\n\nBernie said: \"Now Earl is ripped and I find it hilarious to watch women\u2019s heads turn for him in the street.\n\n\"My poem also made Earl realise he shouldn\u2019t have picked on me for so long and he\u2019s apologised for criticising me.\"\n\nBernie's fat shaming poem These s*** soppy love songs, they do make me laugh, They don\u2019t speak of nose hair or rims round the bath. Or p*** on the toilet seat, hair in the brush, Or pimples or stretch marks or syphilis or thrush. No songs on endless rows about pointless sh*t, That often your partner will act like a t**. And f*** you off so much that you want him gone, They just speak of bullplop, how he is \u2018The One\u2019. Yeah, he is \u2018The One\u2019 who stinks out the loo, When he\u2019s in there for hours, taking a poo. Who leaves off the toothpaste and shampoo lid, Who\u2019s grumpy and moany and acts like a kid. He is the useless, overweight loafer, \u2018The one\u2019 who farts loudly whilst sat on the sofa. Hogging the remote whilst he clips his toenails, Watching football, or cop shows or world\u2019s toughest jails. \u2018The One\u2019 who is constantly adjusting his b****. \u2018Oh he is \u2018The One\u2019, Christ yes, he\u2019s my \u2018all\u2019! My world and my everything, he is my life, I wish I\u2019d said \u2018no\u2019 when he said, \u201cBe my wife\u201d! So when they all sing about meeting \u2018The One\u2019, Wait \u2018till they see what comes out of his bum!\n\nEarl added: \u201cI never meant for my words to hurt Bernie but now realise I shouldn\u2019t have said them. She looks great and I will always love her just the way she is.\"\n\nBernie said: \"The words in my diary were harsh but I don\u2019t regret them, because they gave Earl a kick up the bum and our marriage the boost it needed.\n\n\"Now we\u2019re loved up and whenever I need cheering up, I just read through my poem again \u2013 in secret of course.\"", "description": "Earl Stewart, from Gloucestershire, was horrified when he found what his wife, Bernie had written about him", "authors": ["Julia Sidwell", "Jane Lavender", "Image"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20539998.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-0_THP_CHPP_290919Slug_2258JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
