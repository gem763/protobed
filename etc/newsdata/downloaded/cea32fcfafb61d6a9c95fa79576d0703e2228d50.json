Travelers will need the updated card or other compliant ID such as a passport or military ID.\n\nNon-compliant licenses and IDs can still be used for driving and voting.\n\nCongress approved the new cards in 2005 following the Sept. 11 attacks as a way of preventing identity theft and fraud.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ohio Gov.
