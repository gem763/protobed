If you\u2019re having trouble picking out a new pair of wireless earbuds, the answer might be not to get headphones at all.\n\nBose\u2019s audio sunglasses \u2014 which are billed as \u201csunglasses with a soundtrack\u201d \u2014 combine two basic commuter accessories, with tiny speakers that connect to your smartphone via Bluetooth and play music into your ears. But if you already have a solid pair of Beats or other wireless headphones, do you really need these audio sunglasses?\n\nThat\u2019s what I was asking myself when I got a pair from a press event I attended this summer. I couldn\u2019t imagine a world where I chose Bluetooth sunglasses over my high-quality earbuds.\n\nI set out to see if they\u2019re actually worth the hype.\n\nBose Bose's audio sunglasses have built-in speakers.\n\nMy initial assumption \u2014 that they wouldn\u2019t hold a candle to my standard earbuds \u2014 was immediately proven wrong. The ear pieces were a bit bulkier than those on regular sunglasses because of the built-in speakers, but they produced sound that rivaled those of my beloved Beats.\n\nI quickly learned the best feature is that they turn off automatically when you take them off and place them upside down on any surface, which is something many people do naturally when they take off their sunglasses. In other words, I didn\u2019t accidentally drain the battery in them because I forgot my sunglasses were also my wireless headphones.\n\nI\u2019ve barely taken off these sunglasses since I got them. I particularly like that I\u2019m able to listen to music without having my ears covered by a giant foam pad \u2014 it makes me feel a lot more aware and alert.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m able to listen to music without having my ears covered by a giant foam pad \u2014 it makes me feel a lot more aware and alert.\u201d\n\nThe sunglasses are also sweat-proof, which was a game-changer in the summer when running or on the beach. And in the winter I won\u2019t have to worry about layering a bulky hat, headphones and sunglasses on bright snowy days.\n\nThe price isn\u2019t bad, either: At $199, they cost about the same as either a pair of high-quality designer sunglasses or a pair of high-quality headphones. You can also customize the lenses for an extra $30 (I opted for the add-on reflective rose-gold lenses).", "description": "A review of Bose's audio sunglasses.", "authors": ["On Assignment For Huffpost"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da788ae2100007d1034a2b3.jpeg?cache=pxNKinKHxX&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
