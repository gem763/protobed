Many residents of this sprawling tent city are drug-addicted or disabled, but mental health is the biggest single issue. The Los Angeles Times branded the district a \u2018national disgrace\u2019 and \u2018an ugly epicentre\u2019, but the crisis penetrates far deeper than these squalid, makeshift encampments.\n\nPeople with a mental illness often end up homeless in Los Angeles\u2019 Skid Row after hospitals discharge them.\n\nMany of America\u2019s wealthiest executives and celebrities live in Los Angeles, but when it comes to the homeless, the city is second only to New York in the US. Amid rising housing costs and slow wage growth, the number of homeless people in LA has surged to over 57,000 in recent years. Contrary to popular belief, they found themselves on the streets because of financial problems, rather than substance abuse or mental illness.\n\nLocated in the heart of Los Angeles, the sprawling tent city of Skid Row lies next to the prestigious Fashion District.\n\nOnce on Skid Row, the homeless often fall prey to thieves, criminal gangs, and sexual predators. Instead of helping, police are accused of turning a blind eye and arresting people for sleeping on the sidewalk. Meanwhile, typhus and hepatitis outbreaks are frequent amid the squalor, while health care is out of reach and public lavatories are scarce.\n\nRT correspondent Helena Villar visits LA\u2019s Skid Row to interview homeless people, who explain how they ended up on the street and the difficulties they face. She also looks into what city authorities are doing to address the endemic problem and asks if their actions live up to their promises.", "description": "Thousands of people live on the Skid Row's sidewalks in Los Angeles, also known as America\u2019s homeless capital.
