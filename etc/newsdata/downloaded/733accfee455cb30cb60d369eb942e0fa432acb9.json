Just caught up with celebrity x factor\"\n\nAnother praised: \"@jenlion Just watching X Factor Celebrity - You rock lady!\"\n\nA fourth fan had a bit of a thing for Essex girl Megan: \"Anybody else watching X Factor just waiting for Megan to clearly be the best? She's one of the best country singers on earth.\"", "description": "The new series of X Factor on ITV drew in just half the viewers of the BBC's Strictly, which remains Saturday night's champion", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Digital Eroteme.Co.Uk", "Bbc Guy Levy", "Pa Wire", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20568701.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_EROTEME_191012UT10_SCD_300JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
