Their web site is OK, not as good however as Fidelity's. They do have a \"compare funds\" feature, but like all such engines, it can return very flawed results when you input anything other than a plain vanilla fund.\n\nI don't think they have a feature like Fidelity's \"Select Funds\". That would be a good place to start, even if you end up buying on TDA's platform.\n\nThe answer to your question \"How to pick best Mutual funds\", therefore, really doesn't depend on TDA. You need to use various tools and aids, such as Fido's \"Select Funds\", M* rankings under \"Markets -> Fund Categories\", other analysis, posting questions here, etc.\n\nI believe TDA has most Pimco I-class funds with a remarkable $0 minimum purchase amount. To confirm this, enter the ticker in the Search box, click \"Buy\", then click \"Continue\", and you will see a screen that shows you (among other things):\n\nInformation About This Fund\n\nInitial Minimum Amount: 0.00 Subsequent Amounts: 0.00 Open for Investment: Yes Transaction Fee: Yes Cut Off Time: 4:00 PM EST Settlement Date: T+1\n\nHowever, these are TF funds, so you will pay the TF. The TF that applies to you depends (I think) upon your asset level. I pay $17.99 for buys and sells.", "description": "My company just moved our HSA account to HSA Bank where TD Ameritrade accout was set up for investing.
