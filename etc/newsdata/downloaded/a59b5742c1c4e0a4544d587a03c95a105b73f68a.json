(Image: DC Universe)\n\nTo say that Titans\u2019 second season premiere was a disappointment would be... fair, honestly. It wasn\u2019t an unforgivably-bad hour of superhero television, but it also made the show seem as if it had somehow lost that imaginative X factor that\u2019s made other DC Universe series like Doom Patrol and Harley Quinn shine. Thankfully, the series\u2019 latest episode \u201cRose\u201d is a solid return to form.\n\nWhile \u201cTrigon\u201d ultimately ended up being hamstrung by its narrative connection to Titans\u2019 last season, \u201cRose\u201d feels like the proper beginning to a new chapter in the Titans lives in part because the episode introduces the slightest of time jumps that gives the entire cast a chance to become new versions of themselves. Now operating out of San Francisco, Dick\u2019s turned the Titans into what essentially amounts to a Boys and Girls Club for Metas, Mystics and Angry Orphans.\n\nThough it\u2019s only been a few months since they were all literally possessed by a demon who planned to usher in the apocalypse, everyone\u2019s settled into a comfortable family kind of dynamic that Titans has always needed to succeed in the longterm even though it wasn\u2019t clear at first how the show was going to get everyone into that space.\n\nTo be fair, \u201cRose\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly do much in the way of illustrating how Donna and Kory became a friendly crimefighting duo or when the younger Titans began to accept Dick as their new pseudo-mentor and the episode really requires you to believe that all that character development occurred rather quickly. But after a slow season of everyone gradually coming together, falling out and coming together again, it\u2019s just refreshing to see everyone stepping into more dynamic, vibrant roles that promise interesting things to come.\n\nFollowing her confrontation with Trigon, Rachel\u2019s become a much more reflective and mature person who has a keen sense of what it is that everyone on the team is feeling, though she\u2019s not quick to share what she knows. The Titans are in a good space. Different as they are, Gar and Jason get along well enough and have a rough-and-tumblr kind of friendship that seems genuine.\n\nThough Rachel\u2019s energy\u2019s vastly different than theirs, she enjoys their company all the same and knows that Dick only wants what\u2019s best for them, but she can sense that there\u2019s a powerful tension between Dick and Gar that\u2019s left over from Dick\u2019s attempt to kill the shapeshifter. Rachel understands Gar\u2019s inability to address his complicated feelings about Dick because she\u2019s in something of a similar situation herself.\n\nAs the first of this newest group of Titans-in-training who sought him out and put on the path towards mentorship, Rachel understandably feels a degree of responsibility for being a part of what really helped pull Dick out of the anger-fuelled depression that first drove him out of Gotham. As the two teens are confiding in one another about their feelings, the two Robins take some time to hash their own issues out and acknowledge some of the elephants in the room like the father figure they both share.\n\nDick offhandedly mentioning that Jason\u2019s been watching something inappropriate on the Batcave\u2019s computer is the kind of small character detail that makes you appreciate that they\u2019re not just different Robins, they\u2019re people at different stages in life.\n\nDick understands where Jason\u2019s penchant for being an arsehole comes from \u2014 he\u2019s been there himself \u2014 but he knows that that can\u2019t be the end of a young hero\u2019s development, which is what he fundamentally wants the Titans as an organisation to be focused on.\n\nDick and Raven discussing what to do about Rose. (Image: DC Universe)\n\nDick has more than a few moments in \u201cRose\u201d that echo writer Tom King\u2019s version of a Nightwing whose primary concern is helping people. Not just \u201chelping\u201d in the traditional heroic sense, but literally leading with \u201chow can I help\u201d as a core part of his identity.\n\nDick wants to help Jason become the best Robin he can be, to keep Rachel on the right path, and to make things right with Gar. But at the same time, Dick\u2019s still not exactly taking care of himself and just before he gets a chance to sit with that reality, yet another young person in need to assistance comes crashing onto the scene, drawing his attention.\n\nWhile Rose Wilson (Chelsea Zhang) is more than capable of dispatching a handful of armed police officers with nothing but her hands, she\u2019s far from invincible and what she really needs is a place to lay low. When Dick finds her passed out in an alleyway with the cops still searching for her, he does exactly what you\u2019d expect from the former Boy Wonder and brings her back to Titans Tower just so that she has somewhere to rest and recover.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about Rose\u2019s presence in the town (aside from the obvious Deathstroke foreshadowing) is the way she forces the trio of younger Titans to recognise that they have, in fact, become something of a weird family, and the prospect of someone new joining makes them all feel differently.\n\nFor her part, Rose simply wants to leave the Tower because she knows that she stays there long enough, the person that\u2019s hunting her (who identity she won\u2019t divulge to Dick) will eventually find her and kill whoever dares to stand between then.\n\nThere\u2019s a seriousness and urgency to Rose\u2019s demands to leave because Dick can see the danger written all over her and in the way she\u2019s clearly been trained to kill. Whenever she\u2019s a part of, it\u2019s out of the ordinary and likely to end up with someone dead. But from Dick\u2019s perspective, Rose is in a rather similar predicament to Rachel\u2019s when he first met her and his immediate instinct is to swoop in and try to help.\n\nKory contemplating what she\u2019s going to do next. (Image: DC Universe)\n\nWhile \u201cRose\u201d is definitely a step up from \u201cTrigon\u201d it does still show some of the growing pains Titans is going through in its second season that are connected to the fact that its cast has gotten so big.\n\nWhile all of this is going down in and around the Titans Tower, Donna and Kory are off doing their best Cagney and Lacey apprehending street-level baddies and bonding over their both being non-humans. While Donna\u2019s more or less the same since we last saw her, Kory\u2019s gone through something of a drastic change on a script-level because she now seems to know a hell of a lot more about Tamaran, who she was there, and why she may never want to go back.\n\nKory\u2019s amnesiac, fish-out-of-water phase was fun for a while, but it\u2019s much more interesting to see her interacting with Earth from a more informed perspective, and it makes her encounter with a fellow Tamaranian sent to capture her that much more interesting when he shows up.\n\nHawk and Dove are similarly getting into interesting things in their neck of the woods involving an ordeal with an impossibly cool interpretation of Doctor Light, but all the nifty special effects in the world can\u2019t help \u201cRose\u201d from feeling a bit too overstuffed. But overstuffed is an infinitely better state of being for a show than substantively lacking, meaning that \u201cRose\u201d is nothing if not a step in the right direction for Titans.", "description": "To say that Titans\u2019 second season premiere was a disappointment would be... fair, honestly.
