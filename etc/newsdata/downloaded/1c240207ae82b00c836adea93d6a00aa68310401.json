Meanwhile, financial markets are betting Fed policymakers will agree to split the difference and follow their quarter-point rate cut in July with another one later this month.\n\nPowell said policymakers will be closely watching geopolitical risks, financial conditions, and other incoming economic data as they weigh what to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nMIXED DATA\n\nFed officials are particularly focused on whether a drop in business spending and a manufacturing slump brought on by rising trade uncertainty is spreading to other parts of the economy. Factory activity declined in August as U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up tariffs on imports from China, and China retaliated in kind.\n\nFed research published earlier this week estimated that trade uncertainty could shave about $200 billion from U.S. GDP by early 2020, as companies hold off on investments.\n\nBut so far there are few signs the uncertainty is translating into job loss. U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in August, a government report showed Friday, but strong wage gains and a rebound in hours worked suggested resilience.\n\nPowell, who spoke a few hours after the jobs report, said it was his expectation the U.S. and world economies would continue to grow moderately and would avoid any recession.\n\nBut there are also troubling signs in financial markets, most notably an inversion of the Treasury yield curve, which historically has pointed to a recession 18 months to two years ahead. The Fed's target range for its benchmark policy rate, now 2% to 2.25%, exceeds yields on nearly all Treasuries.\n\nTrump on Friday kept up his call for the Fed to lower interest rates, saying policymakers were wrong to raise them last year.\n\nPowell for his part said he wasn't listening to Trump, or to a call from former New York Fed President Bill Dudley for factoring the 2020 presidential election into his rate-setting decisions.\n\n\"Political factors play absolutely no role in our process, and my colleagues and I would not tolerate any attempt to include them in our decision-making or our discussions,\" he said. \"We are going to act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.\"\n\nPowell's remarks are the last publicly scheduled comments from a U.S. central banker before the Fed's September meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Writing by Ann Saphir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrea Ricci)", "description": "The U.S. Federal Reserve will continue to act \"as appropriate\" to sustain the economic expansion in the world's biggest economy, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday in Zurich, sticking to a phrase that financial markets have read as signalling further interest-rate reductions ahead.  \"", "authors": ["John Revill", "Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EjEd2MjxPt_AnPZ42eSoVg--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/a2053dbaee4647b902d4764a2302590d", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
