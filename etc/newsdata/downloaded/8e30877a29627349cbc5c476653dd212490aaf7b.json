The Communist Party has also used violence to repress Tibetan Buddhists, who do not consider themselves a rightful part of Beijing\u2019s empire, and allow the legal practice of only five religions, all controlled by the state.\n\n\u201cThere is no religious freedom in China or any of its occupied territories because the Chinese Communist Party sees all and any religions as a threat,\u201d one protester told Breitbart News. \u201cThey see that any other being higher than the Communist Party is a threat to the existence of the Communist Party. They have been doing anything they can to crush the existence of religion.\u201d\n\nThe forefront of the movement against Chinese communism has centered itself in Hong Kong, however, since protests erupted there in June. The Hong Kong protest movement is demanding China respect the \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d policy it adopted upon asserting sovereignty over the city in 1997, which bans Beijing from imposing communist law.\n\nOn Tuesday \u2013 as Beijing organized a spectacle in Xi Jinping\u2019s honor featuring 100,000 marchers in an extravagant parade \u2013 Hong Kong pro-democracy activists took the streets in a \u201cday of mourning\u201d in honor of the victims of Chinese communism. In an unprecedented move, a police officer shot a teenage protester in the lungs, missing his heart by three centimeters. The adolescent is currently in stable condition after surgery.\n\n\u201cThere is no turning back, in these times of prevailing injustice it is our utmost responsibility to stand up and fight back against violence,\u201d another protester told Breitbart News in New York. \u201cOne who does not fear death, cares naught for threats.\u201d", "description": "A coalition of minorities facing persecution by the Chinese Communist Party organized a protest outside of the United Nations headquarters.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178364618-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
