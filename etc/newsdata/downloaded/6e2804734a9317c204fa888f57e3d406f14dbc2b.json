We remain prepared to leave without a deal on 31 October.\u2019\n\nMr Johnson is expected to urge key EU players including Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Jean-Claude Juncker, to strike a bargain that he can sell to MPs in Westminster.\n\nThe prime minister hopes that tomorrow the Queen\u2019s Speech will \u2018get this country moving again\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u2018The people of this country don\u2019t just want us to sort out Brexit.\n\nThe Queen\u2019s Speech will take place on Monday, following a three day closure of Parliament (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018They want their NHS to be stronger, their streets safer, their Wifi faster, the air they breathe cleaner, their kids\u2019 schools better-funded \u2013 and this optimistic and ambitious Queen\u2019s Speech sets us on a course to make all that happen, and more besides.\n\n\u2018After one of the least-active parliaments in living memory, the proposals we are bringing forward will get this country moving again.\n\n\u2018This is a Queen\u2019s Speech that will deliver for every corner of the UK and make this, once again, the greatest place on earth.\u2019\n\nWhat new laws will be revealed in Boris Johnson's first Queen's Speech? The measures include a new Environment Bill setting legally binding targets to reduce plastics, restore biodiversity, improve water quality and cut air pollution. There will also be Brexit-related legislation intended to establish a \u2018fair\u2019 immigration system, ensure faster access to new medicines and to open up markets. Specific measures include: Immigration and Social Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill to end freedom of movement and introduce a points-based immigration system from 2021.\n\nRailway reform with a white paper setting out proposals to overhaul the current system of franchising and creating a new commercial model.\n\nBuilding safety standards with the establishment of a new regulator with powers to impose criminal sanctions for breaches of building regulations.\n\nNHS Health Investigations Bill will create a new independent body with legal powers to ensure patient safety.\n\nMental health reform to reduce the number of detentions under the Mental Health Act by ensuring more people get the treatment they need. There was anger after it emerged that an expected Bill to protect military veterans of the Northern Ireland Troubles from repeated investigations into alleged historical offences appeared to have been dropped.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg has warned Brexiteers the Government will have to make compromises to get a deal but insists they can trust Mr Johnson not to concede too much to Brussels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Leader of the Commons said the PM had dedicated his political career to the cause of EU withdrawal.\n\nIt is feared hardline Tory Brexiteers could scupper any agreement Mr Johnson is able to reach, just as they thwarted Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement three times.\n\nWriting in The Sunday Telegraph, Mr Rees-Mogg said: \u2018In the final stages of the Brexit negotiation, compromise will inevitably be needed, something even the staunchest Leavers recognise albeit unwillingly \u2013 but as a Leaver Boris can be trusted.\n\n\u2018He wants to take back control and has dedicated his political career to this noble cause.\n\n\u2018If he thinks the ship of state is worth an extra ha\u2019porth of tar he deserves support.\u2019\n\nThe DUP, whose votes are likely to be crucial to getting a deal through Parliament, fired a warning shot to the prime minister over a reported compromise to end the deadlock over the Northern Ireland backstop.\n\nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar met Boris this week and said they both could see \u2018a pathway to a possible deal\u2019 (Picture: AFP)\n\nDeputy leader Nigel Dodds yesterday warned the mooted plan \u2013 reportedly being discussed by EU and UK officials in Brussels in the wake of Mr Johnson\u2019s meeting last week with Irish premier Leo Varadkar \u2013 \u2018cannot work\u2019.\n\nMr Dodds told the Italian La Repubblica newspaper that Northern Ireland \u2018must stay in a full UK customs union, full stop\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018There is a lot of stuff coming from Brussels, pushed by the Europeans in the last hours, but one thing is sure: Northern Ireland must remain fully part of the UK customs union. And Boris Johnson knows it very well.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier is due to brief EU ambassadors and MEPs on Monday on progress in the talks.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
