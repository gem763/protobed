Nitrogen dioxide is a pollutant which in London is predominately emitted from vehicles. However, it is also produced from wood-burning stoves, and other domestic, commercial and industrial sources. Prolonged exposure to high levels of NO2 can damage the lungs and in children is linked to conditions such as asthma, reduced lung growth and even reduced brain function. Previous studies estimated the effects of high levels of background NO2 in the environment as being as bad for children's lungs as maternal smoking. The authors highlight in their study that the concentrations of NO2 steeply declines with distance from source, so levels in the centre of a large park are likely to be far lower than at the edge, close to a road.\n\n'We know already that hundreds of primary schools and nurseries are located within, or very close to, areas that exceed legal safety limits for NO2, potentially putting children's long-term health at risk, but we may think our green spaces are clean.\n\n'Our research shows this is often not the case, with a large number of public and private parks in the capital exceeding legal limits for harmful air pollutants.'\n\nThe scientists also found that poorer areas of the city had disproportionately polluted parks and playgrounds.\n\nAverage NO2 levels for open spaces in the most deprived areas were 6 \u00b5g/m3 higher than the average for the most affluent places.\n\nThis study, published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, used 2016 pollution data from King's College London's Atmospheric Emissions Inventory.\n\nThe researchers coupled this information with data from the 2011 census to ascertain the number of children under the age of 16 in close proximity to green spaces.\n\nGreen spaces included public parks, private parks - such as Kew Gardens and Buckingham Palace Gardens - allotments, cemeteries, playing fields, golf courses, tennis courts and other sports areas, and other play spaces \u2013 including playgrounds.\n\nA jaw-dropping 67 per cent of private parks strayed outside the international air quality levels.\n\nBustling tourist hubs such as Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens and Regent's Park are among the most polluted places and all exceed the limits imposed by both the European Union and World Health Organisation\n\nDr Laure de Preux, from Imperial College Business School's Centre for Health Economics and Policy Innovation and co-author on the report, said: 'We call London's green spaces the \"lungs of the city\"\n\n'But increasingly we are seeing that these lungs are being poisoned by air pollution and not enough is being done about it.\n\n'These latest findings help us to quantify the risk from average nitrogen dioxide exposure, by mapping exactly which areas are exceeding safety and legal limits.\n\n'We hope this work will help to highlight those areas that can benefit most from mitigation by local authorities and the Mayor of London to reduce air pollution, protecting the health of residents and children.'\n\nLucy Facer, a co-founder of Islington Clean Air Parents, said: 'I'm absolutely horrified by the results of the study. As a mother of two, I spend hours every week in the park with my children.\n\n'It's so important for them to be outside and exercising. Politicians must act urgently so that children don't have to breathe toxic air while playing outside.'\n\nThe findings came as Extinction Rebellion eco-protesters crippled London's transport system with rallies calling for action to tackle the so-called climate emergency.", "description": "Bustling tourist hubs such as Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens are among the most polluted places and exceed the limits imposed by both the European Union and World Health Organisation.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/12/19535402-0-image-a-19_1570708538551.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
