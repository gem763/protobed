It makes no sense that the officer fired his weapon without identifying himself, having almost simultaneously shouted, \u201cShow me your hands!\u201d It makes no sense that in the hours after the shooting, Fort Worth police released a photo of a handgun in Ms. Jefferson\u2019s house \u2014 one she was legally entitled to possess \u2014 but without saying exactly where it was found or whether she had held it in her hand or pointed it at the officer.\n\nNothing computes about Ms. Jefferson\u2019s killing except for one thing: She was black, and the officer who killed her, Aaron Dean, was white. And that is an all-too familiar equation. He resigned Monday shortly before the police department planned to fire him, authorities said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInnocent African American civilians are gunned down by white police so frequently that it would be willful blindness to deny a pattern. The circumstances vary, but the fact remains.\n\nThis time, the victim was a young woman hoping to attend medical school. Her ailing mother\u2019s house, where she was staying while she helped her mother recover from an injury, is in a working-class neighborhood populated mainly by blacks and Hispanics, in a city with a modest crime rate.\n\nAccording to the police department, the officer, moving around the house\u2019s perimeter, saw Ms. Jefferson through her window and perceived \u201ca threat.\u201d That is an assertion, not an explanation. The question in this case, as in so many other unwarranted police shootings, is what could make him feel under threat in such a situation.\n\nAD\n\nIt was just two weeks ago, in Dallas, that a white former police officer named Amber Guyger was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison for shooting her neighbor, an unarmed black man, Botham Jean, as he sat in his own apartment eating ice cream. She said she mistook his apartment for her own. Mr. Jean\u2019s relatives, along with their lawyer and friends, said they hoped that trial\u2019s outcome, the exceedingly rare guilty verdict in an officer-involved killing, would send a message \u2014 that police are not entitled to shoot first and ask questions later; that officers must be trained to de-escalate; that the police departments\u2019 cultures and training regimens must be scrubbed for bias and accountability.\n\nAD\n\nThat message, if sent at all, does not seem to have been received a few miles away in Fort Worth. Again a family is calling for a transparent and impartial investigation \u2014 by an independent agency, not Fort Worth police, which have started a criminal investigation of the officer. They are entitled to that at the very least; so is every other American.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "What prompted an officer to kill Atatiana Jefferson?", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ASc_L3Bi0o3R9ngUQN1VTno2tzU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P4PTQEHOYEI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
