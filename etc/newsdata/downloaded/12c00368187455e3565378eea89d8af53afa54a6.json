I feel offended as a professional and I'm disappointed,\" Ancelotti said. \"The defender doesn't even look at the ball and goes straight for Llorente to try and stop him from jumping. It was a clear penalty. They made a dreadful mistake.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned, you didn't even need VAR but it's ridiculous that the referee didn't go to see the replay ... I don't want to say anything else because I wasn't shown respect and nor was my club.\"\n\nMilik also twice hit the woodwork for Napoli before finally getting his goal.\n\nNapoli remained three points behind Atalanta but fell to sixth.\n\nLAST-GASP WIN\n\nRonaldo had a goal disallowed in stoppage time but then won and converted a penalty to seal the victory against Genoa, which played nearly all of the second half with 10 men.\n\n\"We believed in it and tried right until the end,\" Ronaldo said. \"We created many opportunities, we wanted to win and with each passing minute the tension increased. We knew that Inter had won yesterday and we were second and this was one an added stimulus.\"\n\nMaurizio Sarri's men were looking to bounce back from a disappointing 1-1 draw at Lecce at the weekend and Leonardo Bonucci headed them in front in the 36th.\n\nBut Christian Kouam\u00e9 leveled five minutes later with a bit of luck as he miskicked the ball off his other leg and it wrongfooted Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon.\n\nFrancesco Cassata was sent off for a second yellow card five minutes after the interval but Genoa's chances to hold on were boosted when Juventus substitute Adrien Rabiot was also dismissed for two bookings three minutes from time.\n\nRonaldo, who had earlier missed a sitter, thought he had won the match in the fourth minute of stoppage time but the goal was disallowed for offside.\n\nThe Portugal international was given a second chance minutes later when he was tripped by Antonio Sanabria and he drove the penalty into the bottom left corner.\n\nOTHER MATCHES\n\nRoma defender Federico Fazio was sent off after just 32 minutes but the capital side managed to win 4-0 at Udinese to move fourth.\n\nLazio is a point further back after beating Torino by the same scoreline.\n\nAlso: Calgiari beat Bologna 3-2, Fiorentina won 2-1 at Sassuolo and Sampdoria drew 1-1 with Lecce.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "Atalanta rallied to draw 2-2 at Napoli while a last-gasp Cristiano Ronaldo penalty gave Juventus a 2-1 win over Genoa", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33e639025f2b601377c1cde7f184aa1f371eccec/c=30-0-2567-1427/local/-/media/2019/10/30/USATODAY/usatsports/a526c5ceb2da403f9026e65cea8456dd.jpg?width=2537&height=1427&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
