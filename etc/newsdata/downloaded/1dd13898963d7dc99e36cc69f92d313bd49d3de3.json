His latest album, Wave, certainly reflects that.\n\n\"It's like in sci-fi films, there's so much CG that the story's been lost a little bit, and I feel like in music it's a bit similar in a sense where there's like really amazing fascinating production \u2026 at some point you just want to hear someone talk to you and tell a really thoughtful story,\" Watson explained during his First Play Live session.\n\nSome of Watson's story during the last four years has included losing his mother, separating from his partner, and his longtime drummer leaving the group.\n\n\"I had a very crazy four years of just things changing all the time \u2026 and every time I was like, 'Oh, yeah, I got it!' and it would totally be taken away and I'd have to start over again,\" he said.\n\nDespite all the tumultuous times, Wave is quintessential Patrick Watson. It fits perfectly within the continuum of his catalogue and contains many future classics.\n\nWatch below as Patrick Watson, his band and a trio of backup singers (Carleigh Aikins, Kyla Charter and Meghann Contini) perform songs from Wave \u2014 and re-interpret a titular Patrick Watson classic.\n\nYou can also listen to the entire live session on CBC Listen.\n\nPatrick Watson performs \"Dream for Dreaming\" for CBC Music's First Play Live. 3:49\n\nPatrick Watson performs \"The Wave\" for CBC Music's First Play Live. 4:43\n\nPatrick Watson performs \"Strange Rain\" for CBC Music's First Play Live. 3:47\n\nPatrick Watson performs \"Melody Noir\" for CBC music's First Play Live. 3:44\n\nPatrick Watson performs \"Broken\" for CBC Music's First Play Live. 5:45\n\nPatrick Watson performs \"Turn Out the Lights\" for CBC Music's First Play Live. 5:22\n\nPatrick Watson performs \"Look at You\" for CBC Music's First Play Live. 4:40\n\nPatrick Watson performs \"Drive\" for CBC Music's First Play Live. 3:55\n\nPatrick Watson performs \"Here Comes the River\" for CBC Music's First Play Live. 4:29\n\nPatrick Watson performs \"Adventures in Your Own Backyard\" for CBC Music's First Play Live. 7:17\n\nPatrick Watson performs \"The Great Escape\" for CBC Music's First Play Live. 3:15", "description": "Watch and Listen to Patrick Watson perform songs in our CBC Music Studio", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5330677.1571762938!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/patrick-watson-perform-from-wave.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
