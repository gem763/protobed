Let us not forget that we\u2019re really modern slaves, though we live in more or less comforts; and have the freedom to get paid, without quality in work and even without fulfilling our duties! The only question on which we need to reflect is, are we good or bad slaves; and, we\u2019ve to be convinced that our duty is to strive to be good slaves. Society will be well-managed only when \u201cgood-slaves\u201d are allowed to become our leaders!\n\nA society, organization, or unit of family, lives in harmony when everyone does his specified task, as is required of good slaves. For this, we need elders, leaders and teachers who are the srestha and acharyas, who assume responsibility, love all equally and nurture us to grow by assigning duties and tasks appropriate to our characteristics.\n\nToday, we\u2019ve to ask ourselves, am I in a vocation which I enjoy and where I can excel and serve society? Is my vocation within my character and competence? An organization or society is well-ordered, and has good vyavastha, when people are happy and contented with their lot and take responsibility to do their tasks lovingly and for good of society, not just for selfish ends.\n\nWe\u2019re all different but have a common goal: It is our universal experience that every person is unique and has its own characteristics; in other words, we\u2019re all unequal and are not equal! However, though we\u2019re all different and have different abilities and skill-sets, we all have equal desire to be happy and fulfilled, i.e. we all have a common \u2018North\u2019, a common goal for all our thoughts, words, actions. Fulfilment, happiness, peace are inner and personal experiences, independent of money, status, vocation. As elders we\u2019ve to reflect; are our education and governance giving people an opportunity to be in the right Vocation thru which they can attain fulfilment?\n\nThe family is an integral unit of the society or organization, and is a good model to be replicated in organization and society. What lessons can we learn from the family-unit and apply it our workplace and society at large?\n\nThough all are supposedly equal, they\u2019re not really equal! Who leads the family? It is the responsibility of parents as enlightened householders, to be the guides and mentors to the family and nurture them into mature, value-based and ethical adults. It is their duty to give a lofty vision to the family and others around them in society, so that they\u2019re established in good habits, values, disciplines during childhood before becoming mature householders.\n\nWhere are we going wrong? Is our education transforming the young into enlightened householders so that we can fulfil our duties as enlightened parents-teachers-elders? Why is it that the systems of education, recruitment, training and development, fail to identify the \u2018srestha\u2019 as teachers and leaders? Where are we going wrong? Is our concept of democracy that \u2018all are equal and fit to lead us\u2019 not based on reality? Is our idea that IQ, marks, degrees make the srestha, incorrect? Should education focus on Character-building first? How do we ensure that only people with good character are allowed as leaders? What happens if we develop intellect, but not character?\n\nHow do we harmonize our ancient wisdom with modern ideas to see that our teachers and leaders be men of character?\n\n4. Bharatiya idea of the Srestha: Vivekananda has also commented upon our vyavastha, social system and says: differentiation is a social custom, and all our great preachers have tried to break down the caste differences; and yet every time it has failed and only riveted the chain! Caste is a very good thing. Caste is the plan we want to follow. Not one in million understands what caste is. There is no country without it. The plan in India is from caste to reach to the point of no caste; to raise everybody to the Vedantic ideal of humanity. Throughout history attempts have always been made to raise the lower classes, many have been and many more will follow till all will become \u2018Brahmin\u2019. Our ideal is the Brahmin of spiritual culture and renunciation; implying he, who is striving for the highest perfection and fulfilment, free from hankerings of artha (money) and kaama (desires); and therefore, best suited to be guides and mentors of society.\n\nWhat is this Brahmin ideal? Absence of worldliness, abundance of wisdom, free from selfishness, lives and works to acquire and propagate wisdom and power of love, good and noble, spiritual and moral. The whole society is to be raised to this Brahmin ideal. The Brahmin caste and qualities are two separate things. Everyone is a mix of three qualities Sattva (highest ideal), Rajas (average), and Tamas (lower) and so these three qualities which make a Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaish, or Shudra are inherent in every one, but one or other qualities predominate in varying degrees and at different times. When working for others we display shudrahood, when doing some transaction for profit we\u2019re a vaisha, when striving to right the wrongs we\u2019re kshatriya; and when we meditate and pray, we manifest brahminhood. Naturally it is possible to change from one caste to another.\n\nThis system of division into four varnas is the stepping stone to civilization, making one rise higher and higher in proportion to one\u2019s qualities, learning and culture. Our ideal of caste is meant to raise all humanity slowly and gently towards the realization of that great ideal of the spiritual man who is non-resisting, calm, steady, worshipful, pure and meditative. In that ideal there is God. Thru\u2019 our vocation to serve man as God, is the highest worship, the ideal for us.\n\nWe believe in this vyavastha as one of the greatest social institutions that the Lord gave to man, but the monumental ignorance and pride of many Brahmins, as well as the defects and foreign persecutions, have thwarted the legitimate fructification of this most glorious Indian Institution. It is sheer nonsense to desire its abolition, but should be adjusted occasionally.\n\nDifferentiation is a natural order. I can perform one duty and you another. I can mend a pair of shoes, you can govern, but that is no reason why you are greater, why you should trample on my head.\n\nMahabharat gives an incident where a housewife and a butcher have become wiser even more than a monk, who meditates in the forest, simply by fulfill their duties with love and sincerity; their teaching to the monk is called Vyadh-Gita.", "description": "Unless we learn to obey, we cannot learn to command:\u00a0Discipline, punctuality, time keeping, obedience to norms of work output and good human behavior are the essential requirements of a slave; which, all of us who...", "authors": ["Sunil Kumar"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/themes/blogstheme/images/blog-facebook.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
