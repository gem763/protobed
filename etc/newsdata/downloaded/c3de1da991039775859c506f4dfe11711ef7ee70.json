But the world was aware of a potential security bug in the new iOS 13 update well before its formal release this week \u2014 and despite that awareness, the bug appeared in the version that was released to iPhone users.\n\nThe bug is a security flaw that makes it possible to access a device's contact list without unlocking the phone first. It was first uncovered in the public beta version of iOS 13 that was released to developers by Jose Rodriguez, a tech researcher who demonstrates the bugs in this video.\n\nIn the description of the YouTube video, Rodriguez claims he notified Apple of the flaw on July 17. He posted a video of his method in August, and just about a week ago, circulated a new video that garnered widespread news coverage.\n\nTo exploit the flaw, it seems, all one has to do is receive a FaceTime call on their iPhone and then use Siri's voiceover feature \u2014 which lets users control their phone with their voice \u2014 to send a text message. Once in the screen for sending a text message, users can easily search the phone's entire contact list just by clicking the field to choosing a recipient.\n\nThis process takes a few minutes, so the bypass could only be carried out by someone who has physical possession of a stolen device \u2014 the type of attacker that security measures like passcodes, TouchID, and FaceID are meant to keep out.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, and has not made any public statement on the bug. However, Apple has already moved up the release of iOS 13.1, which will roll out next week on September 24th and include a number of bug fixes \u2014 and a spokesperson told Ars Technica that the 13.1 update will fix the problem.\n\nThe presence of bugs in iOS 13 has already been widely documented. Earlier this week, the US Department of Defense instructed its employees and contractors not to download iOS 13 and to instead wait until the release of iOS 13.1, Inc. reported. Outside the public sector, users have reported running into their share of bugs themselves.", "description": "Apple's latest iPhone software update seems to have a bug that makes it possible to access a device's contact list without unlocking the phone.", "authors": ["Aaron Holmes"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d852cd32e22af1a724bda3c-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
