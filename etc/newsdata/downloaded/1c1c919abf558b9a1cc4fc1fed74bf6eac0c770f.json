The Spartans sputtered to a 7-6 season and were held under 20 points in each of their losses. This year there are signs of improvement, but No. 18 Michigan State will be put to the test Saturday at Spartan Stadium in a rematch with Arizona State.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a confidence level,\u201d Spartans coach Mark Dantonio said. \u201cI think that we\u2019ve been a confident football team, especially on the defensive side of the ball. You know, went a little bit back and forth, obviously had a lot of injuries last year, but big step this past week.\u201d\n\nAfter an underwhelming opener against Tulsa, Michigan State (2-0) broke out offensively last weekend in a 51-17 win over Western Michigan. By contrast, Arizona State (2-0) struggled to put away Sacramento State in a 19-7 victory.\n\nThe Spartans are favored by about two touchdowns this weekend.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna play a team that\u2019s, this is a legitimate football team. They\u2019re big time,\u201d Arizona State coach Herm Edwards said. \u201cThey\u2019re good, and they\u2019re gonna stop you. Sometimes, you\u2019re going to do everything right, and they\u2019re just going to beat you. And you can\u2019t worry about that because that\u2019s going to happen. That\u2019s what I call ball.\u201d\n\nDantonio can take over Michigan State\u2019s career lead in victories with a win this week. He and Duffy Daugherty are tied for first place at 109.\n\nThings to watch when the Spartans host the Sun Devils:\n\nRUNNING GAME\n\nArizona State\u2019s Eno Benjamin needs 45 yards rushing to reach 2,000 for his career, but he\u2019ll be up against a defense that excels against the run. Michigan State was No. 1 in the nation against the run last season and has allowed minus-6 yards on the ground so far this year.\n\nHOME STATE\n\nMichigan State quarterback Brian Lewerke is from Phoenix, so this is a special matchup for him. He threw for 314 yards and a touchdown in the loss at Arizona State last year.\n\nSTREAK\n\nArizona State has scored more than seven points in 136 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the FBS. The Sun Devils had only three points entering the fourth quarter last year before rallying to beat Michigan State.\n\nPASS RUSH\n\nJayden Daniels was the first true freshman quarterback to start the season opener for Arizona State. Through two games, he has thrown for 588 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions - but the Sun Devils have allowed six sacks in two games.\n\n\u201cOffensive linemen, it takes them longer to develop than any other position,\u201d offensive coordinator Rob Likens said. \u201cYou can get away with young receivers, a young running back, you can even get away at times with a young quarterback, but offensive linemen, it just takes time. We\u2019re going to have to develop those guys. We\u2019re going to have to protect them in what we do and it\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d\n\nRECORD\n\nDantonio was reflective this week when asked about Daugherty\u2019s record. Daugherty coached the Spartans from 1954-72, going 109-69-5.\n\n\u201cDuffy was ahead of his time. He recruited all across America - brought players in from the South,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cWhen I came here and I walked into what was the Duffy Daugherty Center at that time, sort of a little hall of history there, and I was amazed.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "This was the moment early last season when Michigan State's offense hit its first major snag.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Trister"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/w_michigan_michigan_st_football_61232_c0-163-4182-2601_s1770x1032.jpg?1a94ffd897cc416e3a5e7aa54b6c9db9c28c12dc", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
