Jennifer Wexton, D-Va., and said her thirst for political correctness was immature and would contribute to the destruction of the country.\n\nWexton grilled Carson during a House Financial Services Committee hearing about his reported comment about \"big, hairy men\" using women's homeless shelters. Carson made the remark at a HUD meeting in San Francisco last month and some in attendance interpreted it as dismissive of transgender people.\n\nCarson claimed he was repeating a story he heard from a women's group that hailed from Alaska but couldn't recall their name. Wexton gave him the opportunity to apologize, but Carson refused.\n\nInstead, he chastised her for being overly sensitive and claimed that thinking like hers would destroy the foundation of America.\n\n\"Well, first of all, I didn't describe transgender women that way,\" he shot back on Tuesday. \"I was relating a story that a women's group told me about big hairy men \u2013 who are not transgender women by the way \u2013 coming into your facility and having to be accepted because of the rules that were in place.\"\n\nHUD SECRETARY CARSON CLASHES WITH DEM REP OVER WITHHELD PUERTO RICO FUNDS: 'NOTHING TO HIDE'\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t feel the need to apologize for those comments?\u201d Wexton asked.\n\n\"No,\" Carson replied. \"I think this whole concept of political correctness: 'You can say this. You can\u2019t say that. You can\u2019t repeat what someone said,' is total foolishness and is going to destroy our nation and we need to be more mature than that.\"\n\nWexton tweeted about the exchange and described Carson's words as hateful while regretting his defiant response.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Today I gave Secretary Carson the opportunity to apologize for his remarks slurring transgender women as, 'big, hairy men,'\" she tweeted. \"Regrettably, he declined that opportunity.
