Not only is it SPF 50 and PA++++ (the highest grade protection against UVAs available), it\u2019s actively soothing on the skin (I find it actually helps prevent breakouts), ultra hydrating (I used it in lieu of a moisturizer all summer long), and leaves no white cast. It\u2019s very nearly perfect (you all seem to agree: the stuff shows up constantly in our What Strategist Readers Are Buying column). Except one, tiny little thing: the lavender scent. While I myself am not particularly bothered by it, I know some of you scent-sensitive beauty lovers (and essential oil-allergic beauty lovers) are. If this describes you, I come bearing good news: Purito just launched a scentless version of their Centella SPF. It has all of the same nourishing, skin-protecting ingredients, without notes of lavender. I\u2019d recommend stocking up.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
