She was held in captivity for months and forced into a marriage with al-Baghdadi before being killed by a Jordanian airstrike in Raqqa, Syria.\n\nMueller\u2019s parents said their daughter might not have been killed in 2015 if Mr. Obama had been \u201cas decisive as\u201d Mr. Trump, the Arizona Republic reported.\n\n\u201cI still say Kayla should be here, and if Obama had been as decisive as President Trump, maybe she would have been,\u201d her mother, Marsha Mueller, said. \u201cFor me what matters most, I\u2019m hoping now we will finally get the answers we have been asking for all along. I think this administration truly might help us. I don\u2019t think they are as closed about what happened.\u201d\n\nDuring his announcement of al-Baghdadi\u2019s death, Mr. Trump mentioned Kayla Mueller in his address. Her father, Carl Mueller, thanked the president for mentioning their daughter and said it was \u201cimportant\u201d to know Mr. Trump knew her story.\n\n\u201cHe knows her story. He\u2019s been briefed on it, and he knows, and that\u2019s important to me,\u201d he said, according to the Arizona Republic. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything would have stopped him from getting this guy.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
