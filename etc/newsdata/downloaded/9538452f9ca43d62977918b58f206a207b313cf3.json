She didn\u2019t quite deliver.\n\nThere are a couple of stand-out moments: one was when she spoke of her position on Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment, saying that she now cautiously backs an inquiry but only if it\u2019s delivered in a way which \u201cisn\u2019t partisan\u201d and doesn\u2019t \u201cdeepen divides in the country\u201d. Depending on where you stand on the issue, that\u2019s either a smart and brave move or a weird and disappointing one. Another was when she put forward an isolationist stance on Syria and Russia, while simultaneously suggesting that her time in the military made her qualified to do so. The last was when she oddly pivoted to criticizing the New York Times, calling a story which referred to her as an \u201casset of Russia\u201d \u201ccompletely despicable\u201d. She may strongly disagree with that characterization of her politics, but a Democratic debate stage sponsored by the Times and CNN in a week when a doctored video emerged of Trump seemingly shooting those media rivals to death felt like the wrong place and the wrong time.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn the end, even fellow outsider Tom Steyer \u2014 the California-based billionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist who\u2019s been accused of buying his way onto the debate stage \u2014 came out looking more coherent than Gabbard. He repeated that there \u201cis something terribly wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue\u201d twice, sure, but then this was an overcrowded debate where everyone had a soundbite they had to keep hammering home \u2014 and he didn\u2019t shy away from talking about strategies to combat income inequality when addressed by moderators as \u201cthe only billionaire on this stage\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cones to watch\u201d \u2014 Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2014 had obviously changed tactics. Post-heart attack and after a September debate where he was accused of \u201cputting his head down and shouting\u201d too much, Bernie took a concertedly more measured tone (though his characteristic pointing and gesticulating stayed, and who would he be without them, really?) He seemed quicker on his feet, made a knowing reference about how he \u201cwrote the damn bill\u201d on Medicare-for-All \u2014 something he\u2019s managed to reclaim as a self-effacing joke after being mocked for passionately repeating a number of times in earlier debates \u2014 and made sure to push environmental policies, the Green New Deal, and the concerns of \u201cworking class people working pay-check to pay-check\u201d rather than leaning on anti-Trumpisms and \u201chealthcare as a human right\u201d. He thanked his Democratic colleagues for their love and support in a genuine-seeming speech that drew applause from across the hall. Despite slightly gleeful \u201cconcerns for his health\u201d from Dems hoping he might drop out the race in the past fortnight, he came out looking stronger than he has for a while.\n\nBiden took the opposite tack: he stayed on message, having been caught out stumbling while ad-libbing answers in previous debates, he injected a little more energy to his routine (\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, get up \u2014 this is the United States of America!\u201d he belted out in his closing statement) and he looked stronger for it. His few moments of unguardedness were harmless, like when he jokingly hugged Bernie Sanders or told Elizabeth Warren that she \u201cdid a good job\u201d in the Obama administration (some saw that as a deliberately patronizing moment akin to when he referred to Kamala Harris as \u201ckid\u201d a few weeks ago, but I\u2019m feeling charitable tonight.) He was well-prepared for challenges about his son Hunter and the Ukraine controversy, and said the only thing he could have said \u2014 \u201cI did nothing wrong\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m proud of my son\u201d, \u201cWe were rooting out corruption in Ukraine\u201d, \u201cHunter\u2019s statement speaks for itself\u201d, \u201cLet\u2019s focus on Trump\u201d, and so on, and so on \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t exactly inspiring. He wheeled out a phrase he\u2019s said a few times during TV appearances of late, about Trump being scared of his candidacy because he knows \u201cI\u2019ll beat him like a drum\u201d, but it didn\u2019t have the power it used to before his family\u2019s nepotistic tendencies started making headline news.\n\nElizabeth Warren was the one everyone wanted to tear chunks out of tonight, and it\u2019s clear why: she\u2019s the new Joe Biden, the frontrunner to beat. At one point, Pete Buttigieg accused her of being a part of \u201ceverything that\u2019s wrong with Washington right now\u201d because she didn\u2019t offer a breakdown of which taxes would deliver Medicare-for-All. Warren offered a calm riposte, but Buttigieg continued by suggesting that Warren\u2019s healthcare plans would deepen divides in the country made by Donald Trump (a line which felt a little off-piste and contrived, as though he\u2019d been briefed in the spin room to go for Warren as much as he could for publicity\u2019s sake.) It was Bernie Sanders who leapt to her defense, repeating Warren\u2019s line that Medicare-for-All means \u201craised taxes, but only for the very wealthy\u201d. It wasn\u2019t the first time Sanders and Warren, previous rivals, backed each other up onstage during the three hours of sparring.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Amy Klobuchar \u2014 who got cheers for saying that pharmaceutical companies should have to pay for the damage done by the opioid crisis \u2014 tried a couple of times, but her claim that \u201cjust because [people] disagree with Elizabeth doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not bold\u201d sounded petulant rather than powerful. Warren responded to the criticism by refusing to go hard on her opponents, relying instead on well-rehearsed numbers and policies which she often marked off on her fingers as she went. She looked like the adult in the room.\n\nOthers put in solid but forgettable performances. Julian Castro repeated policy proposals but spoke little. Kamala Harris started off strong but repeated her claim about attending autopsies and police officers\u2019 funerals word-for-word from an earlier debate and sank into the background. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s only memorable moment was when he was on the receiving end of a particularly pointed barb from Mayor Pete: \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you about courage, political or personal.\u201d He offered nothing in return.\n\nCory Booker used almost all of his airtime to call for Democrats to come together, and to make a plea for civility (\u201cI\u2019ve seen this script in 2016\u201d), which came across as clear-eyed and passionate but ultimately offered little in terms of specifics. He looked like a capable and optimistic VP, rather than a serious contender for president. At the relatively young age of 50, he could still fit in a career which features both positions. After all, his colleague Elizabeth Warren is 71 and when she promises \u2014 as she did tonight \u2014 to outwork everyone, including \u201cTrump or Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with\u201d, it\u2019s hard not to believe her.", "description": "This debate\u2019s \u201cone to watch\u201d was supposed to be Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who returned to the (side of the) stage after being left out in September altogether.
