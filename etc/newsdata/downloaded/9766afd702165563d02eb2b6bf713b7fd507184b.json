But some investors and analysts are starting to question the financial strategy behind Alexa and whether there's a profitable business model emerging for the devices and underlying technology.\n\n\"Amazon has successfully shipped millions of devices to millions of customers \u2014 but to what end?\" said Andrew Murphy, managing partner at Loup Ventures, which invests in start-ups and publishes research on consumer technology. Murphy said he owns Amazon shares personally, though the firm does not.\n\nAfter the last Christmas holiday season, Amazon said it had sold over 100 million Alexa-powered gadgets, and a report soon after from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners showed Amazon with 70% control of the U.S. smart speaker market. Unlike Apple, which commanded only 6% of the market at the time, Amazon isn't aiming to make money off device sales but sees them as a means for getting customers into the Amazon universe, where presumably they'll spend in other ways.", "description": "Amazon has the luxury of low margins as it rolls out an assortment of Alexa devices with no clear path to profit.", "authors": ["Eugene Kim"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106153586-1569619767024gettyimages-1036678514.jpeg?v=1569619785", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
