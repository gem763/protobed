After months of speculation about whether the progressive congresswoman would endorse Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren for president, she is set to throw her weight behind Sanders at a campaign rally on Saturday.\n\nAOC isn\u2019t the only member of the Squad who is Team Bernie. Ilhan Omar endorsed the Vermont senator for president on Wednesday morning, with a video explaining that she is \u201cone of the people that was inspired by the movement that the senator has built\u201d. Rashida Tlaib is also expected to endorse Sanders.\n\nThe Squad are unashamedly progressive. Sanders is the most progressive candidate. The fact that Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Tlaib are backing him should come as little surprise. And yet the idea that female politicians would endorse an old white guy instead of Warren, an old white woman, seemed to throw a number of people for a loop.\n\nJane Eisner, for example, director of academic affairs at Columbia Journalism School tweeted: \u201cI find it fascinating that women of color overlook female and minority candidates to endorse a white guy. Is \u2018identity politics\u2019 over? Is ideology more important than race and gender? Genuinely curious.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll tell you what I find fascinating: the fact that the concept of \u201cidentity politics\u201d has become so thoroughly distorted that people seem to think it means voting for the candidate that looks most like you, or shares your sexual preferences, their policies be damned. The idea that \u201cwomen of colour\u201d would align themselves with a candidate simply because of their sex or skin colour is incredibly condescending. You also can\u2019t ask whether ideology is more important than race and gender, because the three are not separate, stand-alone entities. But as a \u201cwoman of colour\u201d I can tell you right now that ideology is far more important than skin-deep representation.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: if Sanders and Warren were completely interchangeable in their politics then it would make sense to get behind Warren because she is a woman. America is way overdue a female president. But while Warren and Sanders may be far more to the left than the rest of the Democrats, their politics are not identical. Warren has made it clear that she is a capitalist while Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist. That difference isn\u2019t a small question of semantics \u2013 it\u2019s reflective of a fundamentally different world view.\n\nI like Warren, don\u2019t get me wrong. But, for me, one of the most important differences between the two is that Sanders is more progressive when it comes to foreign policy. (And I\u2019d like to remind all the people who seem to think that Warren is far more of a feminist than Sanders that women outside America matter as well.) Warren isn\u2019t a war-mongerer but she seems to be more concerned with ensuring the military is environmentally friendly rather than putting an end to American imperialism. Sanders, on the other hand, has spent his entire life speaking out about the horrors of American foreign policy. Which, of course, has done him zero favours politically: nothing makes you more unpopular with the establishment in this country than suggesting that America isn\u2019t always a force for good in the world.\n\nThat AOC, Omar, and Tliab are endorsing Sanders rather than Warren makes perfect sense from an ideological point of view. Their worldviews are far more aligned to Sanders than they are Warren\u2019s. The more important question, perhaps, is just how significant this endorsement actually is. There are currently three schools of thought on this: 1 It doesn\u2019t make any difference; 2 It helps Sanders because it makes him seem more relevant; 3 It helps Warren because it makes her seem less radical.\n\nMy own view is that, in terms of the primary, it makes very little difference. Sanders isn\u2019t going to get the nomination because the Squad endorsed him, nor will it take a significant number of votes from Warren. But this isn\u2019t to say that the endorsement isn\u2019t significant. Having three prominent women of colour vocalize their support for Sanders makes it harder for the media to keep pushing the ridiculous idea that he doesn\u2019t connect with women or people of colour. It makes it harder to erase his female following and pretend that his only fans are irritating Bernie Bros.\n\nThe Squad\u2019s endorsement is also a reminder that Sanders has done more than any other politician to push America leftwards and make topics like Medicare for All and free education mainstream talking points. As Omar herself said, he has built a movement and inspired a new generation of democratic socialists. There are plenty of people itching for Sanders to drop out of the race and go away, but it\u2019s not going to be that easy to get rid of him, I\u2019m afraid. Bernie may never become president, but he has already started a revolution in America.", "description": "That AOC, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tliab are endorsing Sanders rather than Warren makes perfect sense", "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f567351ffa24fd62588a33c00d23d8f8b0ca2155/0_112_3349_2009/master/3349.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7712bc67f93f8885c4bec1c302d49fe6", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
