In 2015, eBay spun out payment platform PayPal Holdings Inc.\n\nThe company on Wednesday reported about 183 million active buyers across its marketplace and StubHub platforms, compared with 182 million in the June quarter and 177 million a year earlier, while gross merchandise volume fell 4% from the comparable period a year earlier to $21.72 billion.\n\nAnalysts expected about 183 million in active buyers and $22 billion in gross merchandise volume.\n\nOverall, eBay's quarterly profit fell 57% to $310 million, or 37 cents a share. On an adjusted basis, profit rose to 67 cents a share from 56 cents a share a year earlier.\n\nNet revenue was flat at $2.65 billion.\n\nEBay had projected 40 cents to 44 cents a share, or 62 cents to 65 cents a share on an adjusted basis, and $2.61 billion to $2.66 billion in revenue.\n\nWrite to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 23, 2019 17:26 ET (21:26 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
