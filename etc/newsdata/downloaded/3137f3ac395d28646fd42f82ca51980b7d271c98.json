Morey subsequently deleted the tweet but China has threatened to cut ties with the NBA, and some Chinese companies have backed out of broadcasts and sponsorship deals.\n\nAre NBA stars and coaches hypocrites for not speaking out on China? Read more\n\nJames was asked about the situation before his team, the Los Angeles Lakers, played the Golden State Warriors in a pre-season game on Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into a ... feud with Daryl but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated about the situation at hand and he spoke,\u201d James said. \u201cJust be careful what we tweet ... even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech. But there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.\u201d James later said he meant Morey wasn\u2019t educated on the repercussions of the tweet rather than the situation in Hong Kong. Law enforcement have used live ammunition on civilians after months of demonstrations in Hong Kong.\n\nLeBron James (@KingJames) Let me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk About that.\n\n\u201cLet me clear up the confusion,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cI do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019s comments will be jarring to many, as he has been an eloquent voice on social issues and human rights \u2013 including police brutality within the US.\n\nThe NBA, which has won plaudits for encouraging its players to speak out on politics and social justice, has also struggled to handle the situation. The league\u2019s commissioner, Adam Silver, has scrambled to repair the NBA\u2019s relationship with China, which is worth tens of millions of dollars to the league and its players, while defending Morey\u2019s right to free speech. According to ESPN, Silver held a meeting with Lakers and Brooklyn Nets players when the teams played a pre-season game in China last week. Many of the players are said to have been angry that they had to field questions from Chinese reporters on the fallout before Silver had done so. There may well be another source of anger among players: Yahoo Sports estimates that the dispute with China could depress the salary cap \u2013 and therefore NBA wages \u2013 by up to 15% next season.\n\n\u201cI feel like with this particular situation, not only was I not informed enough about,\u201d James said on Monday. \u201cI just felt like it was something not only myself or my teammates or our organization had enough information to even talk about it at that point in time. And we still feel the same way.\u201d", "description": "The NBA\u2019s most famous current player, LeBron James, has waded in to the ongoing fallout between the league and China with comments that are sure to spark controversy", "authors": ["Tom Lutz"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6c908a3e1cdd326cf0284f6dcc1aebf5b734c26/0_105_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=524b87de997fa62e23167bbe3d87e623", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
