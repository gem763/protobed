How the spike will feed through to fuel prices for consumers is less clear.\n\nAnalysts are split on the question. The problem may be that is it too early to tell.\n\nThe key issues are how long output will be disrupted and whether there will be further attacks and another hit to production, says Marc Ostwald, chief economist at ADM Investor Services International.\n\nJennifer McKeown at Capital Economics thinks the most likely scenario is that oil supply from Saudi Arabia will return to normal \u201cfairy quickly\u201d, bringing the oil price down to its previous level by the end of the year.\n\nAlthough consumer prices will still rise in the meantime, it won\u2019t be by much, at least in developed countries, she adds, noting that the previous three big spikes in the oil price were not fully passed on to consumers.\n\nOthers are equally sanguine. Economists Bernd Weidensteiner and Marco Wagner at Commerzbank say a healthy global supply of oil means the effects of the weekend\u2019s \u201cshock\u201d to output will probably be limited.\n\nThere are already signs the initial surge in oil prices was an overreaction. Brent crude soared nearly 20 per cent in the first few moments of trading before retreating to trade 10-12 per cent higher on the day.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, does not expect a further rise.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that even after today\u2019s spike, oil is still almost a fifth lower than where it was a year ago,\u201d Mould says.\n\n\u201cSo economists, analysts, investors and car drivers can probably breathe easy for now.\u201d\n\nBut there are other, UK-specific reasons fuel prices may not rise anytime soon.\n\nSimon Williams at the RAC, a motoring organisation, predicts that wholesale prices of both petrol and diesel will increase by 3p a litre, but says this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean higher prices at the pumps because retailers only just began to pass on wholesale price savings at the end of last week.\n\n\u201cAt that point the 128p forecourt price of petrol was 7p too high, which means retailers should have a cushion to absorb the spike,\u201d he adds.\n\nBut he warns: \u201cIf the barrel price remains high for a sustained period however, it could easily lead to several pence a litre being added to the average price of both fuels.\u201d\n\nSome economists think UK drivers will be affected even sooner by Monday\u2019s rise in oil prices.\n\nBrian Hilliard at Societe Generale says it usually takes no more than a month for the global price to drive up local petrol prices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty stable relationship,\u201d he says, adding that goods and services that rely on transport will also become more expensive as a result. \u201cWe\u2019re are an internet economy now, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nArno Hantzsche at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research also believes the jump in oil prices will inevitably translate into higher fuel and overall consumer prices in the UK.", "description": "Saturday\u2019s attacks on Saudi Arabia that cut 5 per cent off daily global crude production were predictably followed by a jump in oil prices when markets opened.
