The ECB\u2019s decision-makers need to understand the context, make sound choices from among the alternatives and communicate appropriately,\" he added in the interview conducted on Oct. 11.\n\nThe ECB has been trying - and largely failing - to get euro zone governments that run budget surpluses, such as those of Germany and the Netherlands, to loosen their purse strings and support economic growth.\n\nDe Guindos defended the ECB's aggressive stimulus measures, which saw it push its deposit rate further below zero last month and resume a bond-buying program that already totaled 2.6 trillion euro despite opposition from several policymakers.\n\nBut he reaffirmed the side effects of those policies were becoming increasingly apparent and inflation was being kept below the ECB's target of just under 2% by forces outside of its control.\n\n\"Inflation has indeed been below the objective for some time, but behind this there are structural changes for which we don\u2019t yet have a full explanation,\" he said.\n\nThe euro's exchange rate and some market-based interest rates have risen since the ECB unveiled its latest package as a public revolt among policymakers against more money-printing was seen capping the scope for further easing.\n\nDe Guindos said the public divisions \"were not contributing to the effectiveness of the policies\" and called for all rate-setters to back decisions once they are taken.", "description": "Lagarde will take ECB out of ivory tower: De Guindos in El Pais", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9P05L_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
