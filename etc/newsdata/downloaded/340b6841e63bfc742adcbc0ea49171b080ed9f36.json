Even so, South American growers said a deal would bring needed stability to global markets.\n\n\"If they reach an agreement, it will be a lot easier for Brazilian soybean farmers to make projections and calculations,\" said Cayron Giacomelli, soy producer in Mato Grosso state.\n\nChina has already ramped up purchases of US pork ahead of the trade talks in Washington, with the US government reporting record-large weekly export sales on Thursday. Millions of Chinese pigs have died from a deadly disease in recent months, sending China on a global pork buying spree.\n\nBIG-DOLLAR FIGURES\n\nEconomist Bill Lapp, president of Omaha, Nebraska-based Advanced Economic Solutions, was skeptical of the up to US$50 billion figure.\n\n\"We've seen these big-dollar figures before, and they don't always come to fruition,\" he said.\n\nUS soybean prices climbed to the highest point since the start of the trade war ahead of the announcement on Friday. Trump said it will take up to five weeks to get a written agreement.\n\n\"We are encouraged that both sides are at the negotiating table because it is important to reopen this market for American farmers,\" global commodity trader Cargill Inc said in an emailed statement.\n\nChina imported more than 13 million tonnes of US soy in the 2018/19 marketing year that ended Aug 31 and has bought nearly 5 million tonnes more in the current season, according to government data. The sales were far short of the 30 million tonnes or more that China imported annually from the United States before the trade war.\n\nWhile Mr Mnuchin told reporters Mr Trump had agreed not to increase tariffs on US$250 billion of Chinese goods to 30 per cent from 25 per cent, there was no mention of removing the tariffs that have been in place for over a year.\n\nAdvocacy group Farmers for Free Trade said it was too soon to celebrate a deal.\n\n\"The promise of additional ag purchases is welcome news but details on timeline, price, commodities and many other questions will have to be answered,\" Brian Kuehl, co-executive director of the group said in a statement.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [CHICAGO] US farmers cheered the Trump administration's announcement of a potentially dramatic increase in US agricultural sales to China on Friday but warned they needed to see a follow-through of actual purchases. .
