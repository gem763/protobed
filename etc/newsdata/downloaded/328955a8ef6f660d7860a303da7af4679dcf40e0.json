That was two hours longer than my flight from Istanbul to Nigeria.\n\nWelcome to traffic and travel Lagos-style, where the roads are clogged and millions of commuters are choked with frustration about the daily hassle in Nigeria's commercial capital and Africa's fifth largest economy.\n\nDisgruntled commuter Yinka Ogunnubi is a typical example, recently tweet ing: \"Left my house by 5:30 a.m., got to work at 9:10 a.m. This is no longer work, it is suffer-head. Dear Boss, Can I work from home?\"\n\nAlthough many in Nigeria find the city alluring, especially for economic reasons, living in Lagos, the third most stressful city in the world , can take a mental toll.\n\nl e v a r t\n\nThe city is unhealthily crowded. Despite being the smallest state in the country, it has the highest urban population with an estimated population of 22 million people and counting, more than double New York or London's tally.\n\nLagos is projected to become the world's biggest city by 2100, with a population of 88.3 million. It urgently needs better road facilities and a high-capacity transit system.\n\nMental health and productivity disasters\n\nTraffic congestion, with its noise and environmental pollution, takes a huge toll on workers' mental and physical health.\n\nHealth professionals have even linked its overall damage to the increasing rate of suicide in the city.\n\nAccording to consultant psychiatrist Olufemi Oluwatayo, it's not a surprise that Lagos commuters are negatively impacted by the traffic conditions.\n\nA general view of congested traffic in Lagos, Nigeria.

It is no surprise that, in general, many more people seems to be suffering from anxiety and depression.\"\n\nThe situation is also killing workforce productivity.\n\n\"How productive can you be when you stay in traffic for over six hours on a daily basis, conjoined with the things you go through to have a normal life in this city?\" media exec Agnes Marquis said in a report by local media publication Pulse, titled \" Here's why you should think twice before taking a job in Lagos .\"\n\n'Beyond the cubicle'\n\nWhile working conditions across the globe are fast evolving, some Nigerian companies are reluctant to enable their employees to work from home.\n\nHowever workers with the option to decide when, where and how they work perform better, according to a report in the Harvard Business Review.\n\nCompanies in Lagos who have enabled their teams to work from home say they rely on Internet tools such as Slack and ClickMeeting to foster communications remotely.\n\nRelated content Four cities in Africa you shouldn't miss\n\n\"We heavily leverage Slack for internal communication -- this makes it very easy for people to be in the loop of whatever is going on in the company regardless of where in the world they're working from,\" says Abdulrahman Jogbojogbo, who works for financial company Paystack.\n\nThe state's new governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has promised to tackle the traffic issues and also decongest the Apapa port area, but some say his changes need to go deeper as the city creaks under the weight of its vast population.", "description": "Lagos, Nigeria, is an African boom city, no doubt.
