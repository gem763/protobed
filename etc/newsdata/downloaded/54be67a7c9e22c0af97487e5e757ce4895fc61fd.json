And luckily, they can all be learned.\n\nYou need to be disciplined and curious, and have an appetite for growth and confidence.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nAs a performance strategist, I work with high-level executives who have a strong desire to up their game at work. Most come to me with specific goals, like spending more time on the work they enjoy, ramping up their productivity, and becoming a stronger leader. And everyone starts with enthusiasm and a deep desire for change.\n\nBut being a leader today is challenging. The nonstop nature of work, the unpredictability of an ever-changing economy, and the number of meetings that fill our calendar mean most of us are incredibly overwhelmed and that getting off the hamster wheel of our day-to-day lives is difficult. I can't change our work culture, of course, so my job is instead to help people get connected with who they are, become clear about what they do best, and learn how to prioritize effectively.\n\nMost people soar, but there are always those who don't. What's the difference? Over time, I've identified four traits that demonstrate to me that someone can make the change they desire. The good news? With a little effort, you, too, can cultivate these traits and move toward the success that you desire.", "description": "Laura Garnett helps CEOs and executives identify their purposes and create actionable plans to execute them.", "authors": ["Laura Garnett"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d97a046528879167444e82a?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
