U.S. administration officials, notably Sondland, have insisted that shouldn\u2019t be the case.\n\nHoping for a fresh start, Sondland arranged meetings in Brussels earlier this month between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen, as well as with Michel, who is still Belgian prime minister; Borrell, the current foreign minister of Spain; and David Sassoli, the new president of the European Parliament.\n\nThis week, Michel and Borrell are at the United Nations General Assembly, so Sondland seized the moment for another get-together: a private dinner on Sunday evening with Kushner and Ivanka Trump, who are both senior advisers to the president.\n\nOfficials said the dinner stretched on for hours. Michel, who is 43, is just six years older than Ivanka and Jared. (Borrell, at age 72, is from a different generation of politicians.)\n\nNearly three years in, the Trumps remain a mysterious, peculiar, even frightening species to many Europeans.\n\nWhether the new EU leaders truly believe a reset is a realistic prospect remains to be seen. Current EU officials say ties could be better but have made clear that would also require a change in attitude on the U.S. side. Trump has so far shown little willingness to take that route, repeatedly complaining that the EU does not trade fairly with the U.S. and threatening to impose high tariffs on goods like German cars and French wine.\n\nIn any event, Michel, who is close to Emmanuel Macron, could well be following the French president's strategy, well-deployed at the recent G7 summit in Biarritz, of keeping your friends close, and your Trumps closer.", "description": "Envoy arranges powwow with Trump administration\u2019s power couple, Charles Michel and Josep Borrell.", "authors": ["David M.
