Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a degenerative brain disease that is caused by repeated hits to the head. Over time, these hard impacts result in confusion, depression, dementia, explosiveness, aggression, and suicidal thoughts. HOW DOES IT AFFECT BEHAVIOR? Researchers are still unclear on how CTE affects behavior, but a growing swell of studies is offering some answers. CTE sufferers have clumps of tau protein built up in the frontal lobe, which controls emotional expression and judgment (similar to dementia)\n\nThis interrupts normal functioning and blood flow in the brain, disrupting and killing nerve cells\n\nBy stage 3 - i.e. Hernandez's stage - the tau deposits expand from the frontal lobe (at the top) to the temporal lobe (on the sides). This affects the amygdala and the hippocampus, which controls emotion and memory\n\nFamily members also gave information about the athletic background of the brain donors. For former professional players, an online database was also used.\n\nThose who played for fewer than four-and-a-half years were 10 times less likely to develop CTE than those with longer careers.\n\nBut the researchers, led by Dr Jesse Mez, noted several men who played four years or fewer were diagnosed with CTE.\n\nAnd those who played more than 14-and-a-half years were 10 times more likely to develop CTE than those who played fewer.\n\nBut, again, several players with careers 15 years or longer did not have evidence of CTE, according to the results of the study.\n\nThe researchers found no link between position played and CTE. That's despite previous studies suggesting those who play high-impact positions - typically linebackers and running backs - faced the greatest risk.\n\nNo link was also found between CTE and the number of concussions, age of first playing football and participation in other contact sports.\n\nDr Mez, director of the Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Center Clinical Core, said: 'While we don't yet know the absolute risk of developing CTE among American football players, we now can quantify that each year of play increases the odds of developing CTE by 30 per cent.\n\n'We hope that these findings will guide players, family members and physicians in making informed decisions regarding play.'\n\nCo-author Ann McKee, chief of neuropathology at VA Boston Healthcare System and director of the Boston University CTE Center, praised the hundreds of families who donated their loved one's brains.\n\nShe added: 'It is only because of this support that we can confidently estimate the strength of the relationship between duration of play and risk of CTE.'\n\nWhile CTE has been heavily linked to American football, evidence shows it is rife in other sports.\n\nEvidence shows soccer players heading a football, which has been described as being punched in the skull, can lead to CTE.\n\nFormer West Bromwich Albion footballer Jeff Astle had the degenerative brain disease before he died in 2002.\n\nHe died at the age of 59 but doctors said he had the brain of a 90-year-old after suffering multiple concussions from heading the ball.\n\nEx-England captain Alan Shearer has undergone tests to see if he had CTE after heading the ball 100 times a day during his glittering career.\n\nAaron Hernandez had the most severe CTE case ever seen: Scientists found 27-year-old's brain tissue showed extreme damage to memory and impulse control by Mia De Graaf, Health Editor The neuroscientist who analyzed Aaron Hernandez's brain confirmed that he suffered the worst case ever seen in someone so young, with severe damage to regions that affect memory, impulse control and behavior. The 27-year-old former New England Patriots player killed himself in April 2017 while serving life in prison for murder. In September, Dr Ann McKee of the CTE Center at Boston University posthumously diagnosed Hernandez with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a football-linked disease that causes dementia and aggression. Aaron Hernandez was a star tight end for the New England Patriots on a $41 million contract when he was arrested for double murder. in June 2013. Four years later, while serving life in prison, he took his own life. He was posthumously diagnosed with the worst case of CTE ever seen in a football player She formally presented her findings a month later, and confirmed that she had never encountered such extreme degradation in a young brain, pointing out areas of severe tissue damage and microbleeds likely caused by blows to the head. They also found a variant of the APOE gene, which has been linked to increased risk of Alzheimer's, but the scientists emphasized that no gene could inflict the same damage as years of heavy impact from tackling. Dr McKee says she could not say for certain that Hernandez's criminal and suicidal acts were a result of his severe case of CTE, nor whether other 27-year-old players could plausibly have the same pathology. But she says Hernandez suffered substantial damage to several important regions, including the frontal lobe. 'In this age group, he's clearly at the severe end of the spectrum,' McKee said. 'There is a concern that we're seeing accelerated disease in young athletes. Whether or not that's because they're playing more aggressively or if they're starting at younger ages, we don't know. But we are seeing ravages of this disease, in this specific example, of a young person.' Hernandez was diagnosed with stage three out of four, with four being the most severe. This picture shows a scan of Hernandez's brain compared to that of a normal 27-year-old. It shows severe decay in the center of his brain from CTE His brain scans reveal huge clumps of tau protein in Hernandez's frontal lobes, and in the nerve cells around small blood vessels, a unique feature of CTE. These proteins, also seen in dementia, disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, triggering aggressiveness, explosiveness, impulsivity, depression, memory loss and other cognitive changes. Dr McKee cautioned that she has not received many brains of players so young who played to such a high level as Aaron Hernandez, who started playing before the age of eight and was regarded as one of the NFL's top tight ends. The tests showed Hernandez had early brain atrophy and large perforations in the septum pellucidum, a central membrane which is essential to control behavior. Hernandez's brain scans revealed he had a variant of the APOE gene, which has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, a similar disease to CTE. However, CTE uniquely affects certain nerve cells which Alzheimer's appears not to. Hernandez was indicted in August 2013 (pictured). He was convicted of first-degree murder, and sentenced to life in prison in April 2015 The disgraced star had a $41 million NFL contract when he was arrested at his home in June 2013 and charged with the murder of a semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd. Lloyd was the boyfriend of Hernandez's fiancee's sister. He was found dead in an industrial park on June 17, 2013, riddled with bullets. Surveillance footage showed Hernandez at the scene an hour before, then arriving at home minutes after gunshots were fired. In April 2015, Hernandez was convicted of first-degree murder, and sentenced to life in prison. While in prison, Hernandez was charged with another killing - a double murder committed by a drive-by shooting. But in April 2017, he was acquitted of both charges. The next day, he took his own life. His family has since filed a lawsuit against the NFL and the Patriots on behalf of Hernandez's four-year-old daughter Avielle, claiming the club and the league knew about the connections between football and CTE long before Hernandez was drafted.", "description": "Boston University researchers analysed the brains of 266 dead players.
