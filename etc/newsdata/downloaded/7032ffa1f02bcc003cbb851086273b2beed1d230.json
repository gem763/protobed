She also had to get certified by the state to get the $62 per day.\n\n\u201cThe amount of money I get is based on the amount of need,\u201d she told The Times-News . But \u201cthe financial cost is not the only cost of being a caregiver.\u201d\n\nAs Americans continue to live longer, not only does the number of people needing care increase, but much of that burden falls to children who are aging themselves.\n\nThe physical and mental toll on caregivers is phenomenal, said Shawna Wasko of the College of Southern Idaho\u2019s Office on Aging.\n\nWasko knows this first hand since she is a caregiver for her parents while also working full-time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Office on Aging holds support meetings on campus where the caregivers can come and air their concerns or just talk with others sharing the same experiences.\n\nAs many as 40 people can show up for the meetings, Wasko said, and the office serves hundreds of caregivers.\n\nThe Office on Aging helps with resources for caregivers, including access to homemaker services, Wasko explained. Having someone come to the house to vacuum the carpets, do laundry or perform cleaning tasks can lift some of the burden from the caregiver.\n\nThe caregivers assisted by the Office on Aging are often themselves senior citizens, caring for a spouse or older parents, Wasko said.\n\nVan Zante is very appreciative of the Office on Aging and the opportunity to spend an hour and a half a month with others listening to a speaker or a teacher, or just interacting with others.\n\n\u201cWithout Shawna and her department, I don\u2019t know how many of us in the valley would manage,\u201d Van Zante said.\n\nShe has noticed how some of those in attendance at the meetings are so exhausted it\u2019s visible in their eyes.\n\nWhat the organization can\u2019t provide is the strength and energy necessary for the caregivers to keep devoting 24 hours a day and huge sums of money to caring for loved ones with terminal illnesses.\n\n\u201cSociety needs to know about this,\u201d Wasko said.\n\nThe first concern for many caregivers is keeping their loved ones at home, Wasko said. The idea of placing a spouse or parent in a nursing home or other facility raises many other concerns, primary being the high cost and level of care.\n\nThat cost can range from $6,000 a month to $10,000 a month, Wasko said.\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t have that kind of cash,\u201d she noted.\n\nEven when someone qualifies for Medicaid in addition to Medicare, living in a care facility has drawbacks. Assets such as a home or car would eventually need to be sold to reimburse Medicaid, Wasko said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad situation,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have long-term care insurance and you don\u2019t have a lot of money, Medicaid will get it all.\u201d\n\nWasko makes a point to tell those who contact the Office on Aging about a program through the Social Security Administration called Compassionate Allowance. Those under age 65 with certain illnesses can be immediately enrolled in Social Security to ease some of the financial burden on their families.\n\nSince Merchant lives in her daughter\u2019s home instead of her own, she qualifies for Medicaid.\n\n\u201cBasically, she has nothing as far as the state is concerned,\u201d Van Zante said.\n\nWhile Medicare and Medicaid take care of doctor and hospital bills, other items aren\u2019t covered.\n\nMerchant needs a scooter to get around, for instance. \u201cThey don\u2019t pay for the scooter, and I did,\u201d Van Zante said.\n\nThat cost $1,500, plus having a lift for the scooter installed on Van Zante\u2019s van, so she could take Merchant places. That cost another $1,400.\n\nRequirements for home safety, including an alarm system and fire extinguishers, must be paid from Van Zante\u2019s pocket, too.\n\nMerchant has a small income from Social Security, but that is supposed to go to Van Zante for her care.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not allowed to keep more than about $100 per month,\u201d Van Zante said.\n\nThat means, when it comes to buying Christmas presents for more than 30 grandchildren, Merchant doesn\u2019t have the money.\n\nThe cost of being a caregiver for Van Zante extends to her husband, as well. Because she is no longer working, her husband continues to work, at age 68, to provide her with health insurance until she reaches 65 and qualifies for Medicare herself.\n\nAnother cost is the lack of socialization.\n\nBesides watching the loved one get older and sicker, Van Zante has observed, the caregiver starts getting more and more lonely.\n\nTaking Merchant on outings to friends isn\u2019t always an option, so friends stop inviting Van Zante to gatherings.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t always go places,\u201d she said.\n\nBeing able to afford to go on vacation is a challenge, she noted, even if someone could be found to care for Merchant while Van Zante was absent. \u201cThere\u2019s no respite care.\u201d\n\nAnother burden Van Zante faces as a certified family home is having to record everything she does on reports to the state. Whatever medication Merchant takes needs to be logged, even an aspirin. Daily activities also must be recorded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very tedious,\u201d Van Zante said. \u201cI spend a lot of time at my desk.\u201d\n\nWasko is aware of how much the services available through her office are needed and foresees that need increasing.\n\n\u201cHalf of us, by the time we reach 85, will have Alzheimer\u2019s if we don\u2019t find a cure,\u201d she said.\n\nThat means the number of caregivers will increase, along with the need for support on all levels: physical, mental and financial.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Times-News, http://www.magicvalley.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Terri Van Zante left a full-time job making $12 per hour so she could take care of her mom.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Julie A.
