REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/Pool\n\nJohnson is due to meet Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, European Council President Donald Tusk, French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel on Monday and Tuesday, a senior UK official said.\n\n\u201cWhat this gives the Prime Minister an opportunity to do is talk to them at leader level about what some of our proposals are,\u201d the official said.\n\n\u201cWe are under no illusions that there is an awful lot of work still to do and you should view the discussions at UNGA as part of an ongoing process.\u201d\n\nJohnson has promised to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31, with or without a deal, and is seeking changes to the agreement his predecessor Theresa May reached with Brussels.\n\nEarlier this week, Britain shared technical documents with Brussels setting out its ideas for dealing with the contentious issue of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. These were not the formal written legal proposals Brussels has asked for however.\n\nThe British official said the New York talks would be a chance to discuss the ideas set out in the papers, which covered agri-food, customs and manufactured goods.\n\n\u201cThey do provide a significant amount of detail on what we are proposing as a potential way forward,\u201d the official said.\n\n\u201cWhat is obviously encouraging is it is clear that all sides do want to try and achieve a deal, so the onus now is on everybody to work hard to try to find a way through.\u201d\n\nIn New York, Johnson will address a breakfast meeting of British and American business leaders on Tuesday, during which he will set out his pitch for why they should invest in post-Brexit Britain.\n\nHe is also due to hold bilaterals with leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and New Zealand\u2019s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will hold talks with European leaders on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York next week as part of his push to secure a Brexit deal by the end of October.", "authors": ["Kylie Maclellan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432135653&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J269", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
