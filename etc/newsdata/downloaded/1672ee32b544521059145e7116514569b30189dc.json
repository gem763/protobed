Investigators are now trying to secure cooperation from higher-ranking advisers who can offer more direct accounts of Trump\u2019s actions but are also more easily shielded from Congress.\n\nDemocrats are likely to face the first such roadblock Monday, when one of Trump\u2019s closest advisers is expected to defy a subpoena as he awaits a federal court to determine whether he can speak with impeachment investigators. But others could soon follow, legal experts and lawmakers say, forcing Democratic leaders toward a consequential choice: Try to force cooperation through the courts or move on to begin making an argument for impeachment in public.\n\nAt stake is not just how quickly the investigation concludes, but how much evidence ultimately undergirds the case against Trump.\n\nMany Democrats involved in the inquiry already believe they have collected enough to impeach him for abusing his power by enlisting a foreign government to smear his political rivals. But to persuade the public \u2014 and the necessary number of Republican senators \u2014 that the president should be convicted and removed from office, they may need additional proof tying him directly to certain elements of the alleged wrongdoing. They could potentially unearth stronger evidence by turning to the courts, but that could also stall the case for months and risk losing public support, much as some Democrats believe happened in the Russia inquiry.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) speaks with reporters near the secure room where impeachment investigation interviews are taking place on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2019. (Erin Schaff/The New York Times) More\n\n\u201cAs in many investigations, you get to a point where you have to decide how much is enough and whether the incremental value of the additional juice is worth the squeeze,\u201d said Ross H. Garber, a lawyer who is one of the nation\u2019s leading experts on impeachment. \u201cIf anything, they may be surprised by how much cooperation they have gotten from witnesses already, notwithstanding the position of the executive branch.\u201d\n\nFor now, Democrats have not yet exhausted testimony from officials who appear willing to cooperate and have at least peripheral knowledge of the case. At least two more White House officials are expected to testify this week, confirming key events, and other officials from the State and Defense departments involved in Ukraine policy are scheduled to appear, as well.\n\nDemocrats believe a reconstructed transcript released by the White House of a July phone call between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine also significantly bolsters their case. In the call, Trump pressed Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and unproven theories about Democratic collusion with Ukraine during the 2016 election\n\n\u201cWe have a tremendous table of evidence before us that fills in all of the principal, material questions that were raised by the whistleblower,\u201d said Rep.
