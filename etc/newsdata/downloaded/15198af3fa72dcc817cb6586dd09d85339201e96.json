If you preorder it now from Best Buy or Amazon, you'll receive a $25 gift card for the store.\n\nThere are a number of things to like about the Fitbit Versa 2: It's got an attractive, lightweight design that will suit many different wrist sizes and fashion styles. It's also fairly lightweight and comfortable to wear, according to reviews. It's done well on battery tests, easily lasting five days to a week on one charge. And the OLED screen is quite bright, includes an always-on display feature, and sports an easy interface to navigate.\n\nAs with other Fitbits, the Versa 2 includes a number of fitness and health features. It tracks your sleep in the Fitbit app and includes a library of (pared down) third-party apps, from companies including Uber, New York Times, and Starbucks.\n\nThe biggest new feature is Alexa integration. The Versa 2 includes a built-in microphone. Long-press the side button to activate Amazon's voice assistant, and you can use Alexa to set timers and alarms, order an Uber, control your smart home devices, and more.\n\nIf this sounds like something you're interested in, why wait? Preorder the Versa 2, and get a free $25 gift card for your trouble.", "description": "The Fitbit Versa 2, Fitbit's newest Versa smartwatch, has an upgraded design and some neat new features.", "authors": ["Monica Chin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d77bb3c2e22af02f76d053c-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
