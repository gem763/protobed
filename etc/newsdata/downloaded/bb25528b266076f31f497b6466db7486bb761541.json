The status has since been renewed on an 18-month basis, The Washington Post reported.\n\nBut the Trump administration announced last year that it was terminating El Salvador\u2019s TPS. The administration has also sought to end TPS for Haiti, Nicaragua, Sudan, Honduras and Nepal as part of its hard-line immigration agenda. Lawsuits have halted the elimination of the programs.\n\nA year ago, a federal judge ordered the Department of Homeland Security to extend the protected status for Salvadorans and other immigrants under TPS until January 2020.\n\nAs Vox noted, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to soon issue a ruling in a case related to the Trump administration\u2019s decision to terminate TPS. The legal showdown is likely to reach the Supreme Court.\n\nI\u2019d like to thank Acting Secretary of Homeland Security @DHSMcAleenan & @POTUS Trump for recognizing the progress made by the @NayibBukele administration in El Salvador by granting an additional transition period to Salvadorans living in \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 under Temporary Protective Status #TPS pic.twitter.com/g2f7jTIXP4 \u2014 Embajador Ronald Johnson (@USAmbSV) October 29, 2019\n\nOn Monday, DHS said it had agreed to extend the validity of work permits for Salvadorans with TPS through Jan. 4, 2021. TPS beneficiaries would also be provided \u201can additional 365 days after the conclusion of the TPS-related lawsuits to repatriate back to their home country,\u201d the agency said.\n\nEl Salvador Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill said the agreement grants Salvadorans \u201cbreathing room\u201d to find a more permanent solution, like residency or citizenship in the United States, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nTrump officials, however, painted the decision in a different light.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s goal is to create an orderly and responsible process to repatriate Salvadorans and help them return home,\u201d DHS said in a statement. \u201cHowever, a sudden inflow of 250,000 individuals to El Salvador could spark another mass migration to the U.S. and reinvigorate the crisis at the southern border.\n\n\u201cTaking into account these concerns, we have decided to provide additional time to work out that plan. We cannot allow the progress [President Trump] has made the past several months to be negated,\u201d the agency continued.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s about-face on the matter has prompted legal and ethical questions.\n\nRonald Johnson, the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, said in a Monday video announcement that the Trump administration had agreed to an \u201cextension\u201d of TPS. However, as Vox pointed out, a formal extension of the program would require the U.S. to deem El Salvador too unsafe for people to return there.\n\nIn September, the U.S. and El Salvador brokered a controversial agreement that would require asylum seekers who pass through El Salvador en route to the U.S. to first apply for asylum there.\n\nKerri Talbot, director of federal advocacy for The Immigration Hub, told the AP that it was \u201cabsurd\u201d for the Trump administration to \u201csay people can claim asylum in El Salvador, but on the other hand people can stay in the United States because it is too dangerous to go back.\u201d\n\nContradicting the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, insisted the latest agreement was not an extension of TPS \u2015 even though, as the AP pointed out, the effect appears \u201cto be essentially the same.\u201d\n\n(2/2) A clarification: some reporting has spoken of \"extending TPS.\" That has important legal meaning, and that's not what happened w/ the agreements. Rather, work permits for Salvadorans will be extended for 1 year past resolution of litigation for an orderly wind down period. \u2014 USCIS Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli (@USCISCuccinelli) October 28, 2019\n\nThe agreement also raises questions as to whether the Trump administration only extended the work permits for Salvadoran TPS beneficiaries because El Salvador agreed to cooperate with U.S. efforts to reduce Central American migration.\n\nIn March, Trump cut economic aid to El Salvador, as well as Guatemala and Honduras, to pressure on the countries to do more to curb migrant flows to the U.S; he recently unfroze the aid packages.\n\nHill, however, rejected suggestions that El Salvador was being rewarded for scratching America\u2019s back.\n\n\u201cThis is not a quid pro quo,\u201d Hill said, according to the LA Times, using a phrase that Trump and his defenders have used frequently in the impeachment inquiry involving the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the DHS, the U.S. and El Salvador also signed agreements this week that would allow the U.S. to \u201cdeploy officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to advise and mentor their El Salvadoran national police, border security, immigration, and customs counterparts.\u201d\n\nThe two countries also agreed to increase the collection and sharing of biometric data.", "description": "Thousands of Salvadorans with Temporary Protected Status will be able to work in the U.S. for at least another year.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db80f37210000423534b565.jpeg?cache=djrc4z7czh&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
