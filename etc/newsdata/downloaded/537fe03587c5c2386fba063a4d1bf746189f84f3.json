Photo: Torsten Blackwood/AFP/GettyImages\n\nThe Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI) revealed the 10 highest paid CEOs in the ASX200 listed companies, with Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce coming out on top.\n\nThe 10 CEOs on the list earned more than $10 million dollars, with Joyce earning more than $23 million.\n\nThe report also looked at the annual bonuses of ASX200 CEOs and found that only one CEO did not receive a bonus.\n\nAustralia\u2019s top CE0s are making a mint.\n\nA new report from the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI) has revealed the 10 highest paid CEOs in the ASX200 companies, with Qantas boss Alan Joyce taking the crown.\n\nACSI investigated the \u2018realised pay\u2019 \u2013 the value of cash and equity received \u2013 of ASX200 CEOs during the 2018 financial year and found that 10 of them earned over $10 million dollars.\n\nTopping the list was Joyce, who made $23,876,351, followed by Macquarie Group\u2019s Nicholas Moore at $23,855,580 and Treasury Wine Estates\u2019 Michael Clarke ($19,024,334).\n\nTake a look at the rest of the top ten list here:\n\n10 Highest Paid CEOs, source Australian Council of Superannuation Investors.\n\nThe report also looked into the bonuses the CEOs received and found that more than half of ASX100 CEOs received at least 70% of their maximum entitlement. Five ASX100 CEOs received 100% of their maximum bonus.\n\nOnly one CEO didn\u2019t receive an annual bonus at all \u2013 Domino\u2019s CEO Don Meij. This was a record low, as six CEOs eligible for a bonus in the ASX100 didn\u2019t receive one in the 2017 financial year.\n\nIn the foreword of the report, CEO Louise Davidson said investors have been concerned about the emerging \u201cculture of entitlement\u201d around annual bonuses and short term incentives in Australia\u2019s top companies, with this report confirming those fears.\n\nShe further highlighted that the financial services Royal Commission did little to dampen the entitlements CEOs received.\n\n\u201cThese payments occurred in a year when the Royal Commission was in full swing, revealing evidence that executives were not being held accountable for poor conduct,\u201d Davidson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cClearly, corporate Australia is not getting the message that bonus payments should be variable and awarded for stretch performance, rather than being fixed pay under another name. This is a failure of both discipline and leadership.\u201d\n\nBut in more promising trends, Davidson said there have been several companies lowering remuneration for incoming CEOs and reducing cash pay by deferring incentives into equity.\n\nAccording to PwC, new Aussie CEOs are being paid around 33% less than those before them.\n\n\u201cInvestors want to see a greater focus from boards on assessing whether their existing incentive schemes are truly rewarding executives for exceptional performance, or just a top-up for meeting budget,\u201d Davidson said.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
