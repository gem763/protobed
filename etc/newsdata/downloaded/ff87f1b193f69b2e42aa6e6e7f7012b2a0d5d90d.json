A ritual at all games, home and away.\n\nWhile the anthem refers to the thrills of Magnet beer, greasy chip butties and, of course, watching newly promoted Sheffield United, the football club has decided to make it a little more difficult for fans to buy their customary pint (or two), pie and chips before the game.\n\nBeer money: Most kiosks at Sheffield United's ground now only accept cards, not cash\n\nLike many leading clubs, it has turned its stadium into a near cashless area on match days. It means cash is no longer accepted at a majority of food and refreshment kiosks. By the end of the season, the club hopes to have moved towards a totally cashless stadium.\n\nThe club, commonly known as the Blades, says fans can now use contactless debit and credit cards to buy their pre-match (and half-time) alcohol and food as well as mobile payments, including Apple Pay and Google. It argues the cashless move cuts queues and improves hygiene standards as staff no longer need to handle cash.\n\nSheffield United is not the first football club to announce the end of cash on match days.\n\nTottenham Hotspur has made its new stadium \u2013 and surrounding 'campus' \u2013 fully cashless, with the aim of providing 'the best possible fan experience'. Like the Blades, it argues the move is aimed at increasing both the speed of service and hygiene levels.\n\nWould you be annoyed if your football club went cashless? Email jeff.prestridge@mailonsunday.co.uk\n\nOther Premiership clubs, including Crystal Palace, Leicester and Wolves, have gone cashless this season while Brighton has stated its intention to turn its impressive American Express Community stadium into a cashless venue by the start of next season at the latest.\n\nIn the Championship, Sheffield Wednesday has turned Hillsborough fully cashless since the start of the season last month. Joe Braithwait, media officer, says: 'It has been a gradual process over the last 18 months. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive from our supporters.'\n\nSome of the football clubs that have turned their grounds into cashless stadiums \u2013 or plan to\n\nBoth Millwall and Fulham have told the MoS they will go cashless next season. Millwall's Veronica Quinn says cashless payments now make up 54 per cent of its match day takings \u2013 a percentage growing game by game.\n\nShe adds: 'We may have one till in each stand taking cash until the message reaches all our fans, especially the older ones who don't seem to trust card payments.'\n\nBrentford has also said its new ground \u2013 Brentford Community stadium \u2013 currently rising phoenix-like alongside the M4 in West London will be cashless when it opens next year.\n\nAs Sheffield Wednesday's Braithwait says, most supporters seem to have accepted cashless grounds although occasional glitches do occur.\n\nFor instance, Blackburn Rovers experienced a systems malfunction at its recent home game against Millwall that meant it could not accept contactless payments. Thankfully, it has yet to go 100 per cent cashless.\n\nMichael Brunskill, of the Football Supporters' Federation, says the move to cashless grounds has so far attracted little criticism from fans. But he says: 'We want football to be fully inclusive, irrespective of gender, disability and diversity. We want it accessible to all, including those fans who do not use plastic or contactless payment.'", "description": "Like many leading clubs, Sheffield United has turned its stadium into a near cashless area on match days.", "authors": ["Jeff Prestridge For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
