The former Rangers and Netherlands defender died aged 43 on Wednesday after a long battle with motor neurone disease.\n\nIt is an ideal start for Rangers in a tough group and their next match will be away in Switzerland against Young Boys, who lost 2-1 at Porto on Thursday with Tiquinho netting twice for the hosts.\n\nCeltic battled to a 1-1 draw with Rennes in France in a fiery Group E encounter, with Ryan Christie's second-half penalty cancelling out M'Baye Niang's 38th-minute spot-kick for the hosts before the visitors had Vakoun Issouf Bayo sent off at the death.\n\n\"I asked for a reaction from the players at half-time and we certainly got that and we thoroughly merited the point if not the three points,\" said Celtic manager Neil Lennon of his team's fightback.\n\n- Gladbach stunned -\n\nThey now host CFR Cluj, the same side who eliminated them in Champions League qualifying. The Romanians shocked Lazio 2-1 on Thursday.\n\nElsewhere, Sevilla, who won the Europa League three years running from 2014 to 2016, beat Qarabag 3-0 in Azerbaijan in Group A with Javier Hernandez getting their opening goal.\n\nPSV Eindhoven opened up Group D with a 3-2 victory against Sporting Lisbon while Roma crushed Istanbul Basaksehir 4-0 in Group J.\n\nIn the same group Borussia Moenchengladbach were stunned by Wolfsberg, losing 4-0 at home to the unheralded Austrian side who were making their group-stage debut.\n\nIt was a heaviest ever home defeat in Europe for Gladbach, the two-time former UEFA Cup winners.\n\nThe biggest winners on the night were Basel, as the Swiss side hammered FC Krasnodar 5-0.", "description": "Last season's runners-up Arsenal romped to an impressive 3-0 victory at Eintracht Frankfurt in their Europa League opener on Thursday as Mason Greenwood spared Manchester United's blushes and Rangers got the better of Feyenoord.
