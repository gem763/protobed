She didn't want to steal, but the store had been leveled, and looters were already ransacking it, so she figured she would see what she could find.\n\nWhat she found first, it turned out, was a bloated body by the store\u2019s entrance. He appeared to have drowned, Smith said.\n\nLater, Smith and a friend went to a trailer park to check on a coworker who lived there.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t in his trailer but we found his body swollen up in the water,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the punishing sun outside Treasure Cay Airport on Thursday, Smith and hundreds of other stranded Bahamians waited for relief flights on Thursday that weren\u2019t guaranteed to come.\n\nFrom afternoon until night, stories of epic survival struggles permeated the crowd. Several told Reuters of running to neighbors\u2019 homes after theirs were destroyed, only for those homes to crumble as well.\n\nEven those whose houses survived say they must leave Abaco to find work, childcare and medical services. \u201cThere is simply nothing left there,\u201d said Anita Pinder, a 38-year-old mother of two. \u201cIt has vanished. It\u2019s just rubble.\u201d\n\nWhile they waited, the survivors relayed the traumas of the preceding days, scenes of drowned bodies, destroyed homes and the constant, nauseating smell of rotting flesh.\n\n\u201cYou smell the decomposing bodies as you walk through Marsh Harbor,\u201d said Sandra Sweeting, 37. \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere. There are a lot of people who aren\u2019t going to make it off this island.\u201d\n\nSome of the waiting masses were promised a departure on Bahamasair, others on relief flights from volunteer groups or charters. Some were simply at the airport without a plan, hoping to land a ride to Nassau or the United States, and still others were there seeking supplies.\n\nThe small airport in Treasure Cay, a sliver of land connected to Abaco known for its resort, is now in ruins, its buildings toppled, the forest behind it stripped naked so the trees look like used matchsticks.\n\nBottles, trash and dirty puddles span the lot by the runway. Splintered chunks of roof, sprawled across the lot like beached whales, became bleachers for tired survivors, heads covered in shirts, towels and hats to soothe the hours of merciless Caribbean sun.\n\nAs would-be evacuees clamored for answers from anyone who looked to be in charge, tensions mounted. Police, as well as officers from the Royal Bahamas Defence Force, in camouflage and carrying weapons, kept the peace as locals argued over access to supplies coming in on relief flights.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an urgent need to get people off this island,\u201d said Marine Seaman Elmore Steele, 24.\n\nSteele, speaking to Reuters through dark glasses, gun pointed at the ground, said he has not seen any violence, and would neither confirm nor deny reports of violence breaking out in Abaco.\n\nNIGHT AT TREASURE CAY\n\nDorian, the most powerful hurricane on record to hit the Bahamas, swept through the islands earlier this week, leveling neighborhoods and knocking out key infrastructure. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people are still missing. The death toll, which currently stands at 30, is likely to shoot up.\n\nThe Treasure Cay airport has no lights, so planes cannot take off after sunset. As the sun sunk low in the sky, tensions crescendoed. Crowds mobbed a Bahamasair organizer taking names for its final flight.\n\nAs the company furiously rushed families aboard, others raced between idling charter jets, asking if each had any space.\n\nWhen the dust settled, some 20 to 30 evacuees were forced to sleep in cars or make camp at the airport. Others left, though the sheer destruction of Abaco warded many off traveling away from the airport.\n\n\u201cThere is no community there,\u201d said stranded evacuee Wendy Hawkes. \u201cIt\u2019s just gone.\u201d\n\nTwo police officers stayed to serve as security guards, handing out water, cookies, cakes, tents and sleeping bags from a shed where incoming supplies were being stored.", "description": "After Hurricane Dorian destroyed her home in Central Pines, she needed food for her two-year-old daughter.  \u00a0 \u00a0 What she found first, it turned out, was a bloated body by the store\u2019s entrance.  \u00a0 \u00a0 Later, Smith and a friend went to a trailer park to check on a coworker who lived there.", "authors": ["Nick Brown"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2IDe4OjV5vtwT7uFpk5rqQ--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/805914e7f8c4b58064ab4c081b61d1ce", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
