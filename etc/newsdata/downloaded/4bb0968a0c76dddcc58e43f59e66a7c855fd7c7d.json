They also had me at waterproof membrane . I mean, they had me in general. I\u2019m an avid cyclist who braves the elements almost every day. I\u2019ve been waiting for this product launch since I heard about what The North Face was doing way back in January during a tech conference in Las Vegas.\n\nThat\u2019s right, the new line of The North Face Futurelight products is finally here and it almost feels like the holidays arrived a few months early. There\u2019s the Flight Futurelight Jacket, a trail running shell that protects you from the rain and lets your body breathe at the same time. Oh, and the Flight Trail Vest which has pockets for two water bottles. Also: Comfy shorts for long-distance running. And nighttime leggings, just because.\n\nThey\u2019re all designed to be light and comfortable. The jacket I mentioned weighs only 9 ounces and folds into a tiny knapsack the size of your knee. Protection and breathability are usually mutually exclusive but it is now possible to do these things without sacrificing flexibility -- I plan to wear the shirts to work and on a run. Along with cycling, I\u2019m an avid outdoorsman who is known for taking hikes in thunderstorms (you should try it!), so the jacket will also come in handy. Will I actually try the leggings? That\u2019s still TBD.\n\nStay tuned because I will be thoroughly testing most of these products over the next few weeks.
