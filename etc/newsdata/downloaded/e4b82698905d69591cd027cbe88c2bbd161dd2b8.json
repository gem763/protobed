Whether it slips out or they deliberately put it down in a statement, it\u2019s a quick little glimpse into what\u2019s going on in the void behind their vacant eyes. This week saw a few of these glimpses.\n\nIt was a bit of irony that the same people who spent years insisting pouring water up the nose of the man who masterminded the September 11th attacks was torture, would inflict 7 hours of Democrats babbling about climate change on the American people. Luckily, and sensibly, very few Americans bothered to tune in. (Sympathy to those stuck in airports. Even on mute, the crazy crept through.)\n\nWhile all called for things like banning coal, oil drilling, fracking, and nuclear power, they also want to mandate the use of electric cars. None addressed, nor were asked by any of the crowd or the so-called journalist cheerleaders moderating the clown show exactly where they planned to get all the electricity to charge those cars. Once you ban the means of generating 82.9 percent of our electricity (you can add another seven percent since there\u2019s no way any Democrat would support the building of another damn), you\u2019re left with wind (6.6 percent) and solar (1.6 percent). They might as well have called for putting sails on cars.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t what stuck out to me after watching that inadvertent in-kind donation to Republicans (every candidate said at least three things that should end up in campaign ads next year). What hit me was what Julian Castro said about education.\n\nAsked whether climate change should be taught in schools, he obviously said yes \u2013 Democrats support the education system indoctrinating kids with everything except the ability to read, write, and think independently. What bothered me was what he said next.\n\n\u201cI think if we're going to get there though, and this doesn't just apply to curriculum about the environment, it applies to a whole bunch of other stuff,\u201d Castro said, \u201cWe need to do things like end the system of people that get elected, whether it's in Texas or other states, they get elected and then they sit on a state-wide board that determines what is in curriculum. Too oftentimes right-wing conservatives have taken over these boards in places like Texas and they affect who gets into the history books, its slanted view on social studies\u2026\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\nHe\u2019s saying he wants to end the people having a voice in education.\n\nTo every Democrats running for president, anyone not in complete agreement with them is a \u201cright-wing conservative.\u201d At this point you have to assume liberals chant \u201cThis is what democracy looks like\u201d because they like the irony of it.\n\nMeanwhile, on the local level, \u201csanctuary\u201d Montgomery County, Maryland, has seen a rash of reported sex crimes against children in the last few weeks. There have been seven illegal aliens arrested since the end of July for sexual crimes against children.\n\nRather than care about protecting the innocent, the sanctuary county is rallying to the defense of itself.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the group of wealthy, mostly white county government officials issued a statement condemning the Trump administration and \u201clocal and national conservative news outlets\u201d for reporting on this epidemic. For good measure, they added \u201cneo-Nazi sympathizers,\u201d because being disgusted by illegal sexually violating children makes you a neo-Nazi to the left now, even when the victims are, in many cases, family members and minorities themselves.\n\nThe elected accessories after the fact continued, saying, \u201cThese individuals and organizations should be ashamed for spreading false information seeking to establish a baseless, illogical and xenophobic connection between a person\u2019s failure to obtain legal status and their propensity to commit a sex crime.\u201d\n\nUnaddressed in the statement is what remains unaddressed by all these rich racist leftists seeking cheap labor so they and their children don\u2019t mess their manicures \u2013 how many innocent people being victims of crime will it take for them to care? How many children have to have their lives destroyed for these Democrats to support deporting anyone, especially criminals? It\u2019s clearly more than the seven we know of in five weeks. And lord knows how many more they\u2019ve managed to sweep under the rug.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know how they sleep at night, how they can look at their children and not be disgusted with themselves. But when you ascribe to a political philosophy responsible for more than 100 million deaths you have to believe individuals are expendable. Even children.\n\nSo Democrats want to ban everything that made us energy independent (and lowered our CO2 output, by the way), while opposing the public having a voice in education, and condemn reporting on illegal alien crime. Agenda \u00fcber allies (with German used deliberately).\n\nThis is just a sample of what they\u2019re pushing, an accidental peek into their plans because they let the curtains open a little bit to expose their priorities. If this is what they\u2019re willing to admit to in the pursuit of power, what do you suspect they\u2019ll do if they obtain it?\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses", "description": "Everyone once in a while, even if by accident, liberals .09/08/2019 7:35:09AM EST.", "authors": ["Derek Hunter", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/248/556c5a09-22ff-47ad-a406-ea1c43e0aae4.png", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
