He touted his Israel policy and pointed to the huge slate of conservative judges he\u2019s put on the bench, likely reshaping the courts for decades to come.\n\nMr. Trump is courting Christian conservatives who were critical to his 2016 victory and will be pivotal in 2020, as he faces some of the toughest challenges of his presidency.\n\nDemocrats say a phone call in which Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a political rival, merits impeachment.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see or hear that way with regard to me,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s an ugly word.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means horrible horrible crimes and things,\u201d he added. \u201cI can\u2019t even believe it.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump delivered applause lines and humorous gibes amid reports of worsening conditions on the ground in northern Syria, where U.S.-allied Kurds are battling an attack from Turkey.\n\nThe White House last Sunday announced that about 50 American special forces would exit a key buffer zone along the Turkey-Syria border. Days later, Turkey launched a military assault against the Kurds.\n\nOnline commentators on Saturday shared videos of crying Kurdish families and atrocities being committed in the region. They also criticized the president for spending the earlier part of the day on the golf course.\n\nThe president\u2019s handling of the situation has alarmed his evangelical allies, yet Mr. Trump did not back down from his position Saturday, saying he pledged to bring troops home and that the media will criticize him no matter what he does.\n\n\u201cThese wars, they never end, and we have to bring our great soldiers back from the never-ending wars,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay there forever.\u201d\n\nThe White House late Saturday said Mr. Trump released $50 million in stabilization assistance to protect persecuted ethnic and religious minorities in Syria and \u201cadvance human rights.\u201d It called on international partners to contribute as well.\n\nMr. Trump said he understands the Kurdish situation \u201cbetter than most,\u201d and that going into the Middle East in the first place was a big mistake. He pledged to protect Christians and religious minorities in the region and reiterated his threat to sanction Turkey amid the violence.\n\nMuch of Mr. Trump\u2019s speech focused on his battles at home. He said his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was perfectly fine, so House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her troops are injuring the nation with their impeachment ambitions.\n\n\u201cI think she hates our country,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t hate our country, she wouldn\u2019t be doing this to our country.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans have said Mr. Trump\u2019s actions do not merit impeachment, though they\u2019ve struggled to say whether his comments were appropriate.\n\nMr. Trump was defiant in his speech from the hotel ballroom.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming after me because I\u2019m fighting for you,\u201d he said.\n\nCreated in 2006, the Values Voter Summit bills itself as a forum \u201cto help inform and mobilize citizens across America to preserve the bedrock values of traditional marriage, religious liberty, sanctity of life and limited government that make our nation strong.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump in 2017 became the first sitting president to address the summit, which is chiefly sponsored by FRC Action \u2014 the legislative arm of the conservative Family Research Council.\n\nThis year\u2019s summit honored Andrew Brunson, an American pastor who was detained in Turkey in the wake of a failed coup d\u2019etat attempt against Mr. Erdogan in 2016.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed sanctions on Turkey and then secured his release.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
