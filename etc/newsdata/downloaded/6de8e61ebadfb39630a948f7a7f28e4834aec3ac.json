The results are worth a chuckle.\n\nThe amusing incident took place either in preparation for or during the Indonesian Military, or TNI, 74th anniversary military parade and air show at the Halim Perdanakusuma Air Force Base in East Jakarta on Saturday.\n\nWhile the rest of Indonesia's military anniversary display was indeed impressive, this incident looks likely to steal the show. Possibly, the crew of an Indonesian Mi-35P Gunship was inspired by the tower fly-by scene in \"Top Gun\" or maybe they never saw it and failed to anticipate what would happen if they decided to \"buzz the bandstand\" like a rotary wing version of Maverick and Goose. The result was a little more than spilled coffee.\n\nWith several formations of marching units passing in review in front of a large banner and a covered bandstand, the helicopter crew makes a low and slow hovering pass overhead in review.\n\nApparently, the signs and the tent hadn't been tested for the rotor wash from the big gunship. The signs come down, the dust goes up, the bandstand collapses, and we can't stop hitting the \"replay\" button to see the whole thing happen over again.\n\nThe entire episode didn't appear to cause any injuries from the looks of it, except perhaps a bruise to the Indonesian attack helicopter community's ego. Hopefully the entire affair was cleaned up quickly, the Mi-35P crew gained some altitude and flew away, and the parade went on.\n\nMaybe the best takeaway in this video is, if you're going to buzz the tents and a military parade, don't do it in a big helicopter.\n\nWatch the full video here.", "description": "An Indonesian Mi-35P helicopter gunship blew down banners and a band tent in a zany military parade gaff.", "authors": ["Tom Demerly", "The Aviationist"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0aa07cc4a0a503c241965?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
