The CEO says he works hard to recruit people who attended a state school, are rooted to their local communities and come from traditional backgrounds.\n\n\u201cWe certainly do,\u201d Zuckerberg said of his 40,000 mostly US-based employees in an interview with The Post.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a woman who runs our commerce product and is deeply religious,\u201d he said. \u201cThe person who runs policies of the company is quite a prominent Republican. So we have people from quite different views, which I think might be a little bit different from most of the other tech companies. That\u2019s something that I really focused on.\u201d\n\nBig tech companies, sports entities, Hollywood and the media have all faced criticism in recent years for the lack of cultural diversity in their leadership roles. It\u2019s even a problem in the public sector. A whopping 40 percent of the 250 top American public-sector decision-makers are Ivy League graduates, according to a National Journal survey. Only a quarter hold a graduate degree from a public university.\n\nAnd boardroom members typically come from the elite ZIP codes of New York City, Washington, DC, Silicon Valley and their surrounding areas. Zuckerberg himself is an example of the problem: He grew up in the wealthy Westchester town of Dobbs Ferry and went to Harvard before dropping out to focus on Facebook.\n\nThat lack of representation from people who grew up in rural areas or Rust Belt cities \u2014 whose experiences include sitting in a pew on Sunday, getting a little dirt under their nails and owning a gun \u2014 has widened the cultural divide and led to our current polarized political discourse.\n\nWhy? Because almost everyone who decides what ad you see, or how your news is delivered or what behavior is acceptable on and off a sports field is typically made by someone unfamiliar with life in the part of America derisively nicknamed \u201cflyover\u201d country.\n\nZuckerberg says he views Facebook as a series of small communities, where the average Joe can speak out just as powerfully as a prominent politician.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that we\u2019re giving more power to the equal,\u201d he said, \u201cnot just reinforcing existing institutions that exist in society.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s really important for where we are today, to not fall into a monoculture. Real progress has always been made by individuals having a voice and changing many individual steps forward to improve their lives and communities.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg was in Washington for a speech at Georgetown University that was also live-streamed from his personal Facebook page. He will also testify next week before the House Financial Services Committee about his cryptocurrency project Libra.\n\nHe said his speech \u2014 in which he defined his peer group of high-tech companies as the \u201cfifth estate,\u201d taking their place alongside traditional news media \u2014 was one he had been thinking about for a very long time.\n\n\u201cI thought it was important to give a full articulation of my views on free expression. Giving people a voice is so important and it has been throughout history,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring our interview, the seemingly aloof Zuckerberg, 35, was candid when talking about how important his own Jewish faith is to him and relaxed and funny when reflecting on how things have changed since he launched \u201cThe Facebook\u201d in his dorm room in 2004.\n\nZuckerberg has certainly taken his lumps. For years, he has been blasted from all sides for Facebook\u2019s business practices \u2014 from making money on false ads to breaching the privacy of its users. Often times, the Facebook CEO and his team have seemed locked in an ivory tower as they arrogantly battled these crises from on high.\n\n\u201cGiving people a voice is so important and it has been throughout history.\u201d\n\nWith his speech and this interview, Zuckerberg is clearly trying to show his more human side, especially as he fights accusations from both sides of the political aisle. While Republicans insist that users and news with a more conservative bent have been censored on his platform, Democrats claim Facebook spreads political misinformation.\n\nRecently presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren took this to the next level, paying for a deliberately deceptive Facebook ad that read, in part, \u201cBreaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election.\u201d Her ad was a response to Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign ads, which blasted Joe Biden and his son for corruption, charges they both deny. Zuckerberg has so far not removed any of the ads, and has defended this policy.\n\n\u201cPeople worry, and I worry deeply, too, about an erosion of truth,\u201d Zuckerberg told The Washington Post. \u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t think people want to live in a world where you can only say things that tech companies decide are 100 percent true.\u201d\n\nEven in the face of a cancel culture and tribal political war, Zuckerberg believes that free speech is absolute, and he does not think private companies should censor politicians.\n\n\u201cThe hardest threat to free expression comes from our culture itself,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cBecause democracy depends on people holding each other\u2019s right to express ourselves above our own desire to get our way in every debate that we have.\n\n\u201cAnd increasingly, it seems like a larger number of people are willing to put whatever political outcome they want above respecting other people\u2019s ability to express themselves and have a voice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think that that\u2019s really dangerous.\u201d\n\nSalena Zito is the author of \u201cThe Great Revolt: Inside the Populist Coalition Reshaping American Politics,\u201d out now.", "description": "Mark Zuckerberg wants you to know that Facebook strives for diversity in its workforce \u2014 and not just on the basis of race or gender.
