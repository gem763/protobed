The police must respect the law. This is a democracy.\u201d\n\nLaurence Taylor, deputy assistant commissioner of the Met Police, said: \u201cThese conditions have been imposed due to the continued breaches of the section 14 condition previously implemented, and ongoing serious disruption to the community.\n\n\u201cWe have made significant progress in managing Extinction Rebellion\u2019s activity at sites across central London over this past week.\n\n\u201cOfficers have begun the process of clearing Trafalgar Square and getting things back to normal.\u201d\n\nThe Network for Police Monitoring (Netpol) said the order was \u201cdraconian\u201d and potentially open to legal challenge.\n\n\u201cA total ban on a protest in London would normally require the approval of the Home Secretary under section 13 of the Public Order Act,\u201d Netpol added. \u201cThe use of section 14 (imposing conditions on public assemblies) is not intended as a convenient alternative.\u201d\n\nEllie Chowns, a Green Party MEP, said she was arrested after \u201cstanding in solidarity\u201d with protesters in Trafalgar Square. She added: \u201cThe rules have been changed. No longer is any space in London allowable for peaceful democratic protest.\n\n\u201cThis is intolerable. There has been no justification given. The protesters have been peaceful. There is no justification for this curtailment of the democratic right to protest for the future of our children.\u201d\n\nDianne Abbott, Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary, said London-wide ban was \u201cwrong and completely contrary to Britain\u2019s long-held traditions of policing by consent, freedom of speech, and the right to protest\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Extinction Rebellion protests have been largely peaceful and brought vital attention to the climate emergency \u2013 the most important issue facing the world,\u201d she added.\n\nPam Williams, 71, glued herself to Trafalgar Square as police moved into clear the protest. She said: \u201cEveryone on the site, despite being the only area of London that was free of the Section 14, was told at about 8.30pm that they had to leave by 9pm or they would be arrested. I just feel like that\u2019s very short notice.\n\n\u201cI feel possibly that they\u2019ve been approached by people we\u2019ve upset today, maybe the finance sector or the banking sector.\u201d\n\nScotland Yard issued the revised order at the end of a day in which hundreds of activists targeted the UK\u2019s financial hub in the City of London. Protesters blocked traffic outside the Bank of England and glued themselves to the offices of companies they said were \u201cbankrolling the environmental crisis\u201d.\n\nPolice said more than 90 people were arrested after \u201ccausing further disruption to people and businesses in London\u2019s financial district\u201d.\n\nAmong those detained was 77-year-old rabbi Jeffrey Newman, of Finchley Reform Synagogue, who had been praying in the road. He said: \u201cWe have to work alongside those who are absolutely dedicated to trying to save life.\u201d\n\nMore than 1,440 people have been arrested since XR began the latest round of protests began in London last week. The group said its \u201cinternational rebellion continues\u201d despite the new police order.\n\nActivists had already defied the London ban by Tuesday morning, launching a new protest at the Department for Transport in Westminster.\n\nXR\u2019s co-founder, Gail Bradbrook, was filmed climbing the entrance to the building while other demonstrators glued themselves to external walls.\n\nProtesters were also planning to block roads outside the headquarters of MI5 on Tuesday.", "description": "Police have banned Extinction Rebellion protests from continuing anywhere in London, with officers moving in to clear demonstrators from Trafalgar Square and the capital\u2019s financial district.
