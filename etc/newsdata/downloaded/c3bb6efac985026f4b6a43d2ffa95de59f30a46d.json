I\u2019m a single mum. I live my best life for three days a week [while filming]. Am I too old to be TV at the age of 37? I am 37, not 67.\"\n\n(Image: SplashNews.com)\n\nSharing that she could not resist hitting back, the busty star explained: \"I replied to her and she tried to backtrack and imply she meant I was too good for the show but she didn\u2019t mean that.\n\n\"I feel like I have been defending my age since I joined when I was 29,\"\n\n\"People haven\u2019t got anything to attack me by so they go for my age. I would like to see what some of the rest of the cast look like at 37.\"\n\n(Image: Hewitt / SplashNews.com)\n\nAway from TOWIE Chloe is mother to her 14-year-old daughter Maddie - whose fathers identity she kept a secret until earlier this year.\n\nIn April, the TV favourite gave fans a cheeky glimpse of her daughter's father as they celebrated Maddie's 14th birthday at Bloc40 in Essex.\n\nSharing a video of the teenager's father, Chloe joked that her fans were \"nosy f***kers\" for asking what he looked like.\n\n(Image: SplashNews.com)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nShe said: \"So lots of people have always been interested in who is Maddie's dad, well, here he is...\n\n\"I was 18, he was 24... all you nosy f**kers who wanted to know, here he is!\"\n\nChloe, who is sensationally private about her love life, has spoken about Maddie's dad in the past, but never revealed who he is.\n\nThe pair were together for seven years, but she confessed in an interview with New! magazine that they \"ended up like brother and sister\".\n\nThey are said to remain on good terms, and Chloe is still close with his family.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
