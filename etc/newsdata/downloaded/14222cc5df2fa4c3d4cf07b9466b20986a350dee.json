Now, it\u2019s a reality.\n\nSame old Arsenal, always scoring\n\nKim Little, Jordan Nobbs, Lisa Evans, Vivianne Miedema, Danielle van de Donk \u2013 when you see those names on Arsenal\u2019s team sheet, you know there\u2019s going to be goals aplenty.\n\nIt was the first time we\u2019ve seen Miedema and Nobbs together in Arsenal\u2019s starting eleven since last November and it will come as no surprise that we saw both their names on the scoresheet too.\n\nIt was reminiscent of the early stages of last season when Nobbs played in Miedema for the second goal of Arsenal\u2019s 4-0 victory over Brighton, the Dutch striker also setting up Little and Van De Donk for the first and third of the game.\n\nAnd it was only fitting that Nobbs, on her first league start since tearing her ACL last November, capped off a dominant Arsenal performance with a sweetly-struck volley to make it 4-0.\n\nThe four-goal victory was a repeat of Arsenal\u2019s last win over Brighton back at the Amex in April and it was certainly a statement of intent for the Gunners, who still have the likes of Beth Mead, who hit the crossbar after coming on from the bench, to provide additional firepower throughout this year\u2019s campaign.\n\nSuper Steph saves City\n\nThere was a hint of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu about Steph Houghton\u2019s winning strike in today\u2019s 1-0 win over Everton, the Manchester City and England captain effortlessly rolling her free-kick from the edge of the box into the bottom corner.\n\nIt was a trademark Houghton strike, almost identical to the one she scored to give England the lead against Cameroon at this summer\u2019s FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.\n\nThe conditions were tricky at Everton\u2019s Haig Avenue, preventing many clear-cut chances from either side, but Houghton\u2019s sixth-minute strike ensured City maintained their 100 per cent start to the season.\n\nReiten makes her mark for Chelsea\n\nIt\u2019s three goals in two games for Chelsea\u2019s new signing Guro Reiten in the Barclays FA WSL \u2013 a statistic that is sure to put a smile on Emma Hayes\u2019 face as the Blues mount the challenge to retain their league title.\n\nNorway international Reiten struck twice early on in Chelsea\u2019s 4-0 victory away at Bristol City on Sunday, Ji So-Yun adding a third in the second-half before Sophie Ingle capped off the win with her first-ever goal for the Blues.\n\nWith the likes of Bethany England and Fran Kirby at Hayes\u2019 disposal, it never looked like Chelsea would be short of goals this season but add Reiten into the mix and their title hopes certainly appear to be getting brighter and brighter.\n\nDurham tame the Lionesses\n\nAfter coming so close to promotion last season, Durham certainly haven\u2019t hesitated in making their statement of intent this season after storming to a 6-0 victory away at London City Lionesses.\n\nThe Wildcats were just 1-0 up at the break thanks to captain Beth Hepple\u2019s first-half strike from the spot, but new signing Iris Achterhof struck twice early in the second-half to make it 3-0 by the hour mark with her first goals of the campaign.\n\nMolly Sharpe added a fourth and Hepple then doubled her tally before Lisa Robertson put away a stunning free-kick into the top corner to secure a resounding win for the North-East side, sending them straight to the top of the FA Women\u2019s Championship table", "description": "It was another momentous weekend in the FA Women\u2019s Super League with West Ham stealing the headlines by pulling in the second-largest crowd of the league\u2019s history.
