(NASDAQ:POWI) Because Of Its P/E Ratio?", "language": "en", "text": "This article is for investors who would like to improve their understanding of price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). To keep it practical, we'll show how Power Integrations, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:POWI) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. Power Integrations has a price to earnings ratio of 47.84, based on the last twelve months. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 2.1%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Power Integrations\n\nHow Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?\n\nThe formula for price to earnings is:\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share \u00f7 Earnings per Share (EPS)\n\nOr for Power Integrations:\n\nP/E of 47.84 = $94.90 \u00f7 $1.98 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)\n\nIs A High P/E Ratio Good?\n\nThe higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.\n\nHow Does Power Integrations's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?\n\nThe P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. The image below shows that Power Integrations has a higher P/E than the average (29.6) P/E for companies in the semiconductor industry.\n\nNasdaqGS:POWI Price Estimation Relative to Market, October 29th 2019 More\n\nPower Integrations's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.\n\nHow Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios\n\nProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.\n\nIn the last year, Power Integrations grew EPS like Taylor Swift grew her fan base back in 2010; the 94% gain was both fast and well deserved. Having said that, the average EPS growth over the last three years wasn't so good, coming in at 6.4%.\n\nRemember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance Sheet\n\nDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.\n\nSpending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).\n\nHow Does Power Integrations's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?\n\nSince Power Integrations holds net cash of US$245m, it can spend on growth, justifying a higher P/E ratio than otherwise.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Power Integrations's P/E Ratio\n\nPower Integrations's P/E is 47.8 which is above average (17.8) in its market. Its net cash position is the cherry on top of its superb EPS growth. So based on this analysis we'd expect Power Integrations to have a high P/E ratio.\n\nInvestors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. If the reality for a company is better than it expects, you can make money by buying and holding for the long term. So this free visual report on analyst forecasts could hold the key to an excellent investment decision.\n\nStory continues", "description": "This article is for investors who would like to improve their understanding of price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kJmCR89DwBzgMNXwt1vLFg--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/90b25f7794429365d1811357e123308a", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
