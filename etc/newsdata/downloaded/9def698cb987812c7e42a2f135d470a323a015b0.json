Yep, Apple has just unveiled the latest iteration of its hallmark smartphone: the iPhone 11, and even after 12 years, the tech giant has managed to eek out a new round of features. Whether they will be worth the upgrade\u2014or the $700 to $1100 price tag\u2014may well depend on the number of cameras you think a phone should rightly have.\n\nOn Tuesday, during its annual launch event, the company announced three new \u201c11\u201d editions: the iPhone 11 ($699), the iPhone 11 Pro ($999) and iPhone Pro Max ($1,099) as well as a seventh-generation iPad and new Apple Watch.\n\nMore from Robb Report\n\nFrom the front, the new iPhones seem to resemble last year\u2019s X models\u2014larger displays, less bezel and sans home button\u2014but flip them over and their most prominent new feature appears: a second camera, or third depending on the model. In addition to the 12-megapixel wide-angle camera fitted in its predecessor, the new iPhone 11 boasts an second 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera which supports 2x optical zoom. As for the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max, they now have three rear cameras with 4x optical zoom, because why not.\n\nDesigned to appeal to the point-and-shoot (mostly at yourself) generation, the additional cameras are enhanced by an immersive interface and boast an epic 120-degree field of view. Night mode has been added\u2014to compete with rival Pixel and Note 10 devices\u2014and there\u2019s even an improved portrait mode that\u2019s now compatible with pets.\n\nIn addition, Apple claims the new models have the \u201cfastest CPU in a smartphone\u201d thanks to a new A13 Bionic chip (that\u2019s actually what it\u2019s called), as well as \u201cthe best machine learning platform in a smartphone.\u201d There\u2019s \u201cenhanced Face ID\u201d to speed up the creepy Big Brother factor, a new OLED panel for a brighter display, improved battery life\u2014the iPhone 11 has an hour more than the XR while the Pro has 4 hours more\u2014and greater water resistance (up to 2 meters in the 11 or 4 meters in the Pro and Pro Max).\n\nBut maybe the feature Apple loyalists will enjoy the most is the new color palette: The iPhone 11 is available in six shades\u2014purple, white, green, yellow, black, and red\u2014while the Pro and Pro Max will be available in midnight green, space grey, silver and gold.\n\nIndeed, the iPhone may need that added touch of color. Shipments of the phone have decreased by a whopping 25 percent this year, according to the Associated Press. Whether this iteration\u2019s new features and a slight drop in price\u2014the iPhone 11 is $50 cheaper than its predecessor\u2014are enough to counter the slump in sales remains to be seen.\n\nThe iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max are available for pre-order from 5am on September 13 and arrive in-store on September 20.\n\nSign up for Robb Report's Newsletter.
