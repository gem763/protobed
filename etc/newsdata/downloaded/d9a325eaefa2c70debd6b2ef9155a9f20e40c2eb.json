Fuchsberger\n\nMunich is a great city for swimmers \u2013 it has the Olympic pool where Mark Spitz cleaned up in 1972 \u2013 but perhaps the best spot for water babies is M\u00fcllersche Volksbad. A gorgeous Art Nouveau building dating back to 1901, it\u2019s mostly used by locals and has an old-fashioned charm. There are two pools to choose from \u2013 a smaller, warmer one (previously women-only) and a cooler, 31m option for getting some lengths in. There\u2019s also a sauna and steam room available if you\u2019re happy to go nude and native. Entry from \u20ac3.70.\n\nBe inspired\n\nThe Pinakothek der Moderne is packed with significant modern artworks from around the world, including pieces by artists like Bacon, Picasso, Warhol, Klee and Magritte. What sets it apart \u2013 as well as its impressive collection of German artists \u2013 is the way many works are given the space to breathe, including Joseph Bueys\u2019 The End of the Twentieth Century, an assembly of enormous basalt stones which has its own room for full impact.\n\nBe sure to visit the free installation by Walter de Maria \u2013 Large Red Sphere \u2013 which is housed in its own building. A huge polished granite work, it is strangely absorbing thanks to the reflections of the windows around it. Look upon it and imagine the swirling cosmos. (This space is only open April to November, 11-5pm, and November to March, 12-3pm). Entry \u20ac10, under 18s go free.\n\nCatch some waves\n\nAs unlikely as it sounds, landlocked Munich is developing a name for itself in the world of surfing. There are gnarly waves to be caught at Eisbachwelle, by the entrance to the Englischer Garten, and folk have been trying to tame them for 40 years. It\u2019s only suitable for surfers with experience as it\u2019s very choppy, but it\u2019s fun to watch the pros try their luck.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling flush the celebrity-favoured Hotel Bayerischer Hof has got to be top choice \u2013 everyone from Brigitte Bardot to Ben Whishaw has stayed, and there\u2019s a shrine outside for Michael Jackson who wanted to move in.\n\nCommissioned by King Ludwig I, it\u2019s been in the same family for four generations, and has recently had a luxurious update to several interiors by Axel Vervoordt. It has a spa, theatre, nightclub, cinema and five restaurants ranging from traditional Bavarian to three Michelin-starred, so in bad weather you don\u2019t even need to venture out. Doubles from \u20ac310, room only.\n\nFor a break with bags of quirk, try the NYX Hotel, which is decorated by local artists. There\u2019s an open-plan restaurant, bar and dining area as well as its own burger grill. There\u2019s an in-house nightclub too with resident DJs. Doubles from \u20ac82, room only.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nPreysinggarten \u2013 despite being one of the city\u2019s oldest inns \u2013 has a modern feel (including plenty for veggies to enjoy) and looks to the Mediterranean for inspiration, with hearty staples including pasta and pizza. It\u2019s renowned for its friendly service and there\u2019s also a play area outside for families. Mains \u20ac15-20.\n\nAs for local delicacies, pop into any decent bakery for a slice of the decadent apricot-chocolate, seven-layered Prinzregententorte (one layer for each state of Bavaria). It was created by Prince Regent Luitpold who took the throne in 1866 but was suspected of involvement with his nephew, King Ludwig II\u2019s, death. He decided to create a cake to boost his popularity; and while people liked the dessert just fine, it turns out a bad reputation is harder to fix...\n\nWhere to drink\n\nFor cocktails or a pre-dinner tipple, Falk\u2019s Bar (within the Hotel Bayerischer Hof) is beautiful and, despite its delicate mirrored walls, was the only space in the hotel to remain unscathed by the war.\n\nCocktail aficionados will no doubt be familiar with Charles Schumann \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most famous bartenders \u2013 so you\u2019ll want to visit his eponymous bar. Schumann\u2019s Bar may not be suited to the Cinderellas amongst us (it transforms from a restaurant to an evening spot at midnight) but its enormous menu and slick service is worth the late night.\n\nIn Munich, as in the rest of Germany, each bar only serves one variety of beer, so you\u2019ll need to plan in a crawl (or come for Oktoberfest!) if you want to try all seven of the local brews. The unanimous favourite seems to be Augustiner, so look for signs advertising it outside.\n\nWhere to shop\n\nWhile the shops in the F\u00fcnf H\u00f6fe centre tend to be pricey, it\u2019s worth popping in to see any resident artworks in the central space, or enjoy a coffee outside in view of its imposing metal sphere sculpture.\n\nFor bargain books and vintage clothing, do as the local students do and explore the Englischer Garten area.\n\nArchitectural highlight\n\nFor a city that suffered so much wartime destruction there\u2019s a surprising amount to choose from, but one of the most eye-catching is the yellow Theatine Church of St Cajetan on the main square. Rococo and ornate, it\u2019s the final resting place for numerous Bavarian royals.\n\nNuts and bolts\n\nWhat currency do I need?\n\nEuros.\n\nWhat language do they speak?\n\nGerman.\n\nShould I tip?\n\n10 per cent in restaurants and for taxis. In bars, round up to the nearest euro.\n\nWhat\u2019s the time difference?\n\nOne hour ahead.\n\nWhat\u2019s the average flight time from the UK?\n\nTwo hours.\n\nPublic transport\n\nIt\u2019s small enough to get around on foot but there\u2019s also a handy tram service.\n\nBest view\n\nFor a quirky experience, climb up inside the Bavaria Statue \u2013 the Germanic equivalent of the Statue of Liberty! The Amazonian woman was built in 1844 and climbing the 66 steps into her crown will earn you views across the Theresienwiese, the open space where Oktoberfest is held, as well as downtown Munich.\n\nInsider tip\n\nTake tea at the Glockenspiel Caf\u00e9 at 11am, 12pm or 5pm for a prime view of the famous Neues Rathaus cuckoo clock sparking into life outside.", "description": "Munich might be best known for Oktoberfest, but this accessible destination holds its own on a contemporary city break throughout the year.
