The document also says that the new law would \u201cby no means limit the principle of openness of the journalistic craft\u201d and that its introduction would be preceded by a series of consultations.\n\nAccording to the manifesto, the party also aims to create a \"new media order\u201d based on the public media \u2014 television, radio and news agency.\n\nRados\u0142aw Fogiel, the party's deputy spokesperson, said that the idea was driven by the fact that journalism is \"a profession of public trust, which has a big impact in shaping attitudes and social decisions.\u201d He told reporters that the proposed self-government would be run by journalists and modeled on similar bodies for lawyers.\n\nBut the opposition says the idea of regulating journalists is a PiS attempt to limit checks and balances on the government's actions.\n\n\u201cThe journalism profession has been indeed regulated in Poland. It was regulated during communism. Journalists are regulated in many countries, for example in Belarus,\u201d Cezary Tomczyk, an MP from the opposition Civic Platfrom party, said at a press conference.\n\nKrzysztof Skowro\u0144ski, the head of the pro-government Polish Journalists\u2019 Association, told POLITICO that it\u2019s hard to make any comments about the new idea, as very few details are known.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that independence and free speech would have to be a basis of new rules,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m skeptical about [creating] a new law and any definition.\u201d\n\nHe said his association will take active part in public consultations to ensure that \u201cjournalistic independence won't be compromised, on purpose or by mistake.\u201d\n\nSince PiS came to power in 2015 the party has tightened its grip on the public media, and slashed advertising from state companies to media outlets critical of the government.\n\nIn the 2019 edition of the World Press Freedom index, Poland slumped to 59th place among 180 countries, down from 18th place in 2015.\n\n\"The public media have been renamed 'national media' and have been transformed into government propaganda mouthpieces,\u201d said the World Press Freedom report.\n\nAnother ranking by Freedom House, a U.S.-based NGO, downgraded Poland in 2017 from free to partly free \"due to government intolerance toward independent or critical reporting.\"\n\nHungary, which ranks even lower than Poland in the World Press Freedom report, has an extensive system of regulation for its journalists.", "description": "The government aims to create a \u2018new media order.\u2019", "authors": ["Zosia Wanat", "Jan Cienski", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-512606340-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
