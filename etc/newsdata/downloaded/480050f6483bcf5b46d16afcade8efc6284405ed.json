Mitt Romney said Monday his Utah constituents are split on whether he is too tough of President Trump \u2014 or not tough enough.\n\nThe Utah Republican told USA Today that during a series of town halls he asked: \u201cHow many of you in the room think I\u2019m being too tough on the president?\u201d\n\nMr. Romney said about half the room raised their hands, and that the other half raised their hands when he asked if he needed to be more critical of the president.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to associate with people of like mind, and they assume everyone thinks the way they do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so, our town hall meetings have been quite civil.\u201d\n\nMr. Romney also criticized Mr. Trump for pulling troops out of northern Syria, saying the U.S. abandonment of Kurdish forces is a \u201cbloodstain in the annals of American history.\u201d\n\nMr. Romney was one of the few GOP senators to raise concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to seek an investigation into 2020 political rival Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nMr. Romney said it was \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d when the White House released notes from the call.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
