Cannabis Stocks Are Imploding", "language": "en", "text": "\u00a9 Reuters.\n\nIf you were among those who invested in cannabis stocks, you may now be worried about another dot-com bubble. Major pot stocks have seen share prices drop in the past several months, contrary to expectations.\n\nYou may have expected exponential growth following the legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada, so this may make you worried about the entire industry.\n\nThe good news is that this is still no reason to panic and shun pot stocks altogether. First off, growth estimates for legal marijuana are still on track. There is an excellent explanation for this inexplicable trend, but you need to look at some specific companies to see it.\n\nTwo great examples to illustrate the state of the cannabis industry are Aphria Inc. (TSX:APHA) (NYSE:APHA) and Cronos Group (TSX:CRON)(NASDAQ:CRON).\n\nWhy are pot stocks on the decline? On April 15, 2019, Aphria announced earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 ended February 28, 2019. In the earnings report, APHA had recorded a net income loss of $108.2 million or $0.43 per share.\n\nThe damage was contrary to market expectations of $0.03 gains per share, sending stocks 15% lower from the previous trading day\u2019s closing price of about $13.50 on the TSX.\n\nPositive results then followed these depressing results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 ended May 31, 2019. In this quarter, profit was $15.76 million following a 74% growth in revenue from the third quarter. Although stocks grew significantly by 40% after the news, share prices would still not break above $10.\n\nThe story is not much different from that of Cronos, which has experienced a decrease of over 50% in stock price since the beginning of the year. However, unlike Aphria, which enjoyed profits in the fourth quarter, Cronos Group still made operating losses in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 ended June 30, 2019.\n\nWhat does this mean for pot stocks in general? The aforementioned Aphria and Cronos are but two examples of the general trend in the marijuana industry. Critics of the industry claim that pot stocks and market growth expectations were too optimistic.\n\nThe marijuana industry is expected to reach a valuation of $66.3 billion by 2025 in North America and up to $100 billion worldwide.\n\nCritics couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, however, as over $10 billion was invested in 2018 in North America, with funding through 2019 expected to reach $16 billion.\n\nPublic marijuana companies raised $394.1 million in January 2019 alone. This amount is in line with the estimated CAGR of 24.1%, demonstrating that the industry\u2019s growth was not overly optimistic.\n\nTo get the real picture of pot stock performance, you would need to look at the past couple of years. Looking at the stock prices from last summer, both APHA and CRON stocks have increased in value.\n\nThe recent decrease in stock price can therefore be attributed to volatility in the markets and lack of investor confidence. As for the losses recorded by cannabis companies, these were because of acquisitions by these companies that put a dent in cash flow.\n\nShould you invest? Looking at price charts of cannabis stocks on the TSX, most of these companies experienced a spike around the start of the calendar year in response to the legalization of marijuana in Canada and the subsequent hype.\n\nCurrent declines in stock price are thus due to market correction, as these stocks achieve actual valuation. Now is therefore the time to buy pot stocks because of obtaining real valuation, in short, they can only go higher.\n\nFool contributor Adam Othman has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.\n\nThe Motley Fool\u2019s purpose is to help the world invest, better.
