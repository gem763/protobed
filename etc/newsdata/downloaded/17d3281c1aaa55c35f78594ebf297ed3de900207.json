The Cubs also remained 2\u00bd games ahead of Philadelphia for the second NL wild card.\n\nDaniel Vogelbach\u2019s pinch-hit RBI single in the eighth accounted for Seattle\u2019s only run in its fourth loss in five games.\n\nF\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez (1-5) lasted just three innings in his third start since coming off the injured list after being sidelined for more than three months with right shoulder stiffness.\n\nThe Cubs played without All-Stars Kris Bryant and Javier B\u00e1ez due to injuries. Bryant was scratched due to right knee soreness, and B\u00e1ez missed his second straight game with a jammed left thumb.\n\nBut they had more than enough against the lowly Mariners, especially with Contreras and Zobrist back in the lineup.\n\nContreras had been out since he strained his right hamstring during a 4-1 victory over Milwaukee on Aug. 3. The fiery catcher spiked his bat in celebration after he led off the second with a soaring drive into the bleachers in left-center for his 20th homer.\n\nZobrist reached twice and scored two runs from the leadoff spot in his first major league action since he left the team in May to be with his family while going through a divorce.\n\nZobrist, who received a standing ovation from the crowd of 33,958 before his first at-bat, led off the fifth with a bunt single. Kyle Schwarber then singled before Castellanos drove Wade LeBlanc\u2019s pitch deep to right, giving the Cubs a 5-0 lead.\n\nCastellanos has 12 homers and 24 RBIs in 31 games since he was acquired in a trade with Detroit on July 31. It was his 23rd homer overall this year.\n\nSchwarber led off the seventh with his team-high 33rd homer, a drive to the back of the bleachers in right. He went 3 for 3 and scored twice.\n\nMAKING MOVES\n\nThe Mariners recalled infielder Shed Long and right-hander Zac Grotz from Triple-A Tacoma. Grotz worked the eighth.\n\nThe 24-year-old Long, who made his major league debut in May, is considered one of Seattle\u2019s top infield prospects.\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t play every day, but I do want to get him in there,\u201d manager Scott Servais said.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMariners: C Omar Narv\u00e1ez (back spasms) was out of the starting lineup for the second straight day. \u2026 SS J.P. Crawford met with doctors before missing his fourth consecutive game with right hamstring tightness. \u201cIt tested out pretty good strength-wise with that hamstring,\u201d Servais said. \u2026 OF Mitch Haniger wants to play again this season, but Servais said his lower back is still bothering him. Haniger hurt his back while rehabbing from a ruptured testicle. \u201cIt may be a situation where he gets a second opinion and see if there\u2019s something we\u2019re missing,\u201d Servais said.\n\nCubs: LHP Derek Holland was activated from the 10-day IL. The reliever was sidelined by a bruised left wrist.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMariners: LHP Marco Gonzales (14-11, 4.30 ERA) starts Thursday night in the opener of a four-game set at AL West-leading Houston. LHP Wade Miley (13-4, 3.06 ERA) gets the ball for the Astros.\n\nCubs: Following an off day, LHP Jos\u00e9 Quintana (12-8, 3.90 ERA) and Brewers RHP Chase Anderson (6-4, 4.58 ERA) meet again Thursday night in the opener of a four-game series in Milwaukee. Quintana tossed 5 2/3 scoreless innings in the Cubs\u2018 7-1 victory over Anderson and the Brewers on Friday.\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nicholas Castellanos homered and drove in four runs, and the Chicago Cubs celebrated the return of Willson Contreras and Ben Zobrist by topping the Seattle Mariners 6-1 on Tuesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jay Cohen"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/mariners_cubs_baseball_99901_c0-152-3630-2268_s1770x1032.jpg?7287a486d6e7adddb18434e3145b46d61aa2c116"}
