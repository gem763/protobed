This will be tough but manageable, Oppenheimer said. But if carbon pollution continues rising through the middle of the century, then sea-level rise by 2100 could exceed 2 feet 9 inches. Then \u201cthe job will be too big,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be an unmanageable problem.\u201d\n\nThis release concludes a trilogy of special reports from the IPCC. The first came last October, when it warned that even \u201cmoderate\u201d warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius would generate irreparable damage; and the second was published last month, with a summary of how climate change will reshape the planet\u2019s land surface. After this new report, the IPCC will fall silent until 2021, when it will publish its sixth major assessment of climate science.\n\nIn other words, the IPCC\u2014whose recent reports have overthrown the climate conversation both in the United States and around the world\u2014will publish nothing new until after the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe headline finding of this report is that sea-level rise could be worse than we thought. The report\u2019s projection of worst-case sea-level rise by 2100 is about 10 percent higher than the IPCC predicted five years ago. The IPCC has been steadily ratcheting up its sea-level-rise projections since its 2001 report, and it is likely to increase the numbers further in the 2021 report, when the IPCC runs a new round of global climate models.\n\nRead: Are we living through climate change\u2019s worst-case scenario?\n\nBut sea-level rise is only one of the bewildering consequences of climate change listed in the report, whose view stretched \u201cfrom the highest mountains to the bottom of the ocean,\u201d according to Ko Barrett, a vice chair of the IPCC and a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. What\u2019s clear is that climate change is going to reshape every system made of water on Earth.\n\nThat means that as the ocean warms, seafood safety will decline: Mercury will accumulate in fish, and the toxic bacteria Vibrio will become more common. And climate change will sicken people. In the Arctic, where indigenous people rely on seafood diets, food- and waterborne illnesses are already increasing.\n\nClimate change will also prompt extreme coastal-flooding events\u2014think of Hurricane Harvey or Katrina\u2014to surge in frequency. Floods that used to happen every century will now happen, in some places, every year. It will push the worst rainstorms, including tropical cyclones and hurricanes, to dump even more water. And it will increase the frequency of extreme El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events like the \u201cmonster El Ni\u00f1o\u201d that struck in 2016. This threatens to induce intense \u201cwhiplash between wet and dry periods,\u201d Andrea Dutton, a climate scientist at the University of Wisconsin, told me.", "description": "Sea-level rise will become unmanageable, and life will flee the world\u2019s tropical oceans, if carbon pollution keeps rising, a new report from the UN climate panel says.", "authors": ["Robinson Meyer"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTR3EY19/facebook.jpg?1569428600", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
