(Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nDALLAS \u2060\u2014 Who doesn\u2019t like a little pregame ruckus?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe rivalry game between No. 11 Texas and No. 6 Oklahoma got off to a frisky start on Saturday morning. With the teams barking at each other around the 30-yard line at the end of pregame warmups, referee Mike Defee took matters into his own hands.\n\nDefee flagged both programs for unsportsmanlike conduct fouls, barking into the microphone at a volume fitting for the carnival outside at the Texas state fair. It\u2019s unclear what started the jawing, but it didn\u2019t appear to be much different than the normal trash talk before a heated rivalry game.\n\nThings got heated during pregame ahead of the Red River Showdown \ud83d\ude33 pic.twitter.com/HXLZPfTxB8 \u2014 FOX Sports (@FOXSports) October 12, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the moment appeared genuinely benign, it could have impacted the game in a big way. The double unsportsmanlike foul call on both teams meant, according to Defee\u2019s loud declaration, that any player flagged for an unsportsmanlike conduct foul would be thrown out of the game. Defee then had this to add before the pregame coin toss.\n\nReferee Mike Defee is being roundly mocked here in Dallas. Someone tell him we're not here to see him: \"This is the greatest rivalry....I expect this game to be hard fought and well played. We\u2019re going to play this game with sportsmanship. Is that clear?\" \u2014 Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) October 12, 2019\n\nIt loomed over the game because it meant that any Oklahoma player flashing the \u201cHorns Down\u201d symbol would be thrown out of the game. The specter of \u201cHorns Down\u201d loomed large prior to the game.\n\nStory continues\n\nOklahoma\u2019s 34-27 victory didn\u2019t feature any actions that required Defee to call another unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. We learned during the game that Defee enjoyed hearing the sound of his own voice booming through the Cotton Bowl. He kept speaking to a pool reporter after, including calling the pre-game jawing \u201can embarrassment\u201d and an \u201cunfortunate mess.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened out there is an embarrassment to everyone,\u201d Defee said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t happen. At the end of the day, that\u2019s why we did what we did and issued a warning.\u201d\n\nDefee added that he has jurisdiction from an hour before the game to administer penalties. He said it was the first time he\u2019d ever executed double penalties like that before the game.\n\nHe reported the actions this way: \u201cThey both came together and started jawing and started pushing. I\u2019m not sure there weren\u2019t punches thrown. I got hit a couple times. My head linesman got hit. It was just clear cut because I warned both coaches prior to the start of the game about how we were going to manage pregame and we wanted to get this game started without incident.\u201d\n\nHe went on to add that in games like this, stadiums \u201cought to have ropes that create clear separation\u201d between the teams pre-game. He said the Cotton Bowl only having one tunnel to exit complicates the pregame exit. \u201cIt just turned into an unfortunate mess in a very good rivalry game,\u201d Defee said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unnecessary.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Officials flagged both teams after a pregame exchange of words.", "authors": ["Pete Thamel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Eg_dJgkQQSyjCkw0FJ.JuQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04ODA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ULlO1QI8wBeW9MbIApUkmg--~B/aD0yNDI0O3c9MzUyNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/efdc58a0-ed07-11e9-abbf-00260b2bf6ee", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
