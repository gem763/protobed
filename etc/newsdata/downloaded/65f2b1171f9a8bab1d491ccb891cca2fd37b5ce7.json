Four out of the five parties in Northern Ireland want it up and running?\"\n\nResponding, Mr Barclay said: \"This is about a reserved matter that applies to our international agreements as a United Kingdom and not the powers that sit with the Assembly within the Good Friday agreement.\n\n\"And that is why there wasn't a willingness to give one community a power of veto over the other.\"", "description": "There were cries of \"shame\" from the Labour benches at a joke about the late MP's autobiography", "authors": ["Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Pa", "Birmingham Post", "Mail", "Uk Parliamentary Recording Unit Handout Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20653345.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_TRMRMMGLPICT000020013859.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
