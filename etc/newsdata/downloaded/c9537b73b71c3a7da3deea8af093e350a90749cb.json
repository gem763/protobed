The catch? A year before, the growth rate stood at 93%.\n\nForrester projected online retailers in India to generate about $4.8 billion in sales between September 25 and October 29. Satish Meena, an analyst at the research firm, said about 80% of these projected sales \u2014 $3.84 billion \u2014 were expected to occur between September 29 and October 4.\n\nFor Amazon India, which has invested more than $5.5 billion in the nation, RedSeer\u2019s findings are more troublesome. According to the research firm\u2019s estimate, Flipkart \u2014 together with e-commerce businesses Jabong and Myntra that it owns \u2014 commanded 63% of the market share during the festive season. Amazon India settled with just 22%.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson in India declined to comment on the finding, but expressed concerns with the way RedSeer conducts its surveys. The spokesperson said these \u201cspeculative reports \u2026 lack robust and credible methodology.\u201d\n\nAmazon India did not share its internal findings, but volunteered to cite a Nielsen\u2019s survey of 190,000 users in 50 cities. Per Nielsen, Amazon commanded 51% of all transactions during the festive sales, 42% of all orders, and 45% of all \u201cvalue.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson added that \u201cthis event has been our biggest celebration ever.\u201d The company received orders from 99.4% zip codes in India, and saw participation of over 65,000 sellers from 500 cities. \u201cOver 88% new customers came from small towns,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nFlipkart did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMany in India have been watching the e-commerce sales as a test to see if it could kickstart the slowing consumer spending in the nation. The sales, leading up to the Hindu festival of Diwali, has traditionally been the season of lavish and reckless consumption in India.\n\nAnd for Amazon and Walmart, a lot was riding on this festive season. The first half of this year has been slow for Amazon and Flipkart in India, said Meena. The e-commerce giants were subjected to disruptive changes in local e-commerce policy earlier this year, which forced both to delist hundreds of thousands of goods overnight from their marketplaces.\n\nAt a conference last week, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross expressed concerns over some of India\u2019s recent regulatory changes, saying that India has become one of the most protectionist nations in the world. Indian newspaper The Economic Times reported last week that Amazon had cut investment in its India business by a third this year. Citing the report, Ross said disruptive policy changes influence the way global giants see the Indian market.\n\nBut disruptive policies is only one of the causes of concerns for international giants. India\u2019s economy has slowed to a six-year low. Forrester\u2019s Meena said the sales last week was the time when both Amazon and Flipkart could have bounced back. According to industry reports, e-commerce businesses generate nearly a third of their annual sales in India during this festive season.\n\nBut even as the growth rate has slowed down, Meena said the fact that both these companies along with other online retailers were able to generate so much sale is good news for them.\n\n\u201cOverall 2019 has been a slow year for e-commerce,\u201d he told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cTwo things are clear, though. One is that there remains a big opportunity for e-commerce in India. Second, consumers from smaller cities and towns are increasing their online spending.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, both Amazon and Flipkart have steered clear of sharing any meaningful internal data. Flipkart said that its marketplace had registered \u201c2X sales growth.\u201d The company said it had seen \u201c3X transaction growth\u201d and electronics grew over \u201c70% from tier 2+ cities.\u201d Amazon said \u201cfashion grew 5X\u201d and beauty items saw \u201c7X\u201d jump in sales.\n\nThe companies have never disclosed exact figures, so it is impossible to fathom how one should assess this growth.", "description": "Even India\u2019s biggest festive season, featuring blinding marketing blitzkrieg and heavy discounts from Amazon India and Walmart\u2019s Flipkart, has failed to escape the pains of slowing economy.
