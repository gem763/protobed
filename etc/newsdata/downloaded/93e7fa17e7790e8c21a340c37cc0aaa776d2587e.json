Last year, Beerbongs & Bentleys\u2019 \u201cOver Now\u201d recruited M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce\u2019s Tommy Lee for a trip into the atmospheric sorta-rock typified of late by Imagine Dragons and Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man, as Post lashed out at people who doubt him, both in relationships and in the public eye. \u201cBroken Whiskey Glass\u201d and \u201cOver Now\u201d punch through party-rap tropes to peek at the motivations behind the drinking and drug use on the surface; it\u2019s hard to reconcile the cynicism prevalent in Post Malone\u2019s music with the general impression of him as a lighthearted stoner. He\u2019s saying something about fame, but we\u2019re not all listening.\n\nThis month, his third album, Hollywood\u2019s Bleeding, repeats the trick: Across a single rapid-fire verse and a melodramatic chorus, \u201cInternet\u201d melts down about leakers, aspiring Instagram models, bad press, and social-media slander, all in the build to a climax where Post sweetly proclaims, \u201cI don\u2019t get on the internet no more.\u201d It\u2019s a page from the Kanye West playbook of public paranoia, the same mix of snark, stress, and holiday-jingle strings that were batteries for \u201cRunaway\u201d and \u201cRoboCop.\u201d (\u201cInternet\u201d lists West as a producer, and fans will recognize it as \u201cInstaLove\u201d from the Yandhi leaks, with the placeholder Kanye verse scrubbed.) Post had a close call last summer when two tires blew out of a private Gulfstream jet meant to carry him from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey to Luton in London, forcing the flight to plot an emergency landing in Hudson Valley\u2019s Stewart International. Logging onto Twitter to assure fans that he landed, he discovered people wishing he\u2019d crashed. Three weeks later, a Kia T-boned a Rolls-Royce carrying the singer through West Hollywood, after which he got out and tweeted, \u201cGod hates me lol.\u201d At 24, Post Malone is fortifying a house in northern Utah as an \u201coasis\u201d from the bloodsucking social scene that soured him on Los Angeles.\n\nHollywood\u2019s Bleeding revisits the fearful mood of Beerbongs tracks like \u201cParanoid,\u201d a song written after Post was informed of a break-in at his old Hollywood home. He Ping-Pongs between stressing over the machinery of fame and having fun in spite of himself. The first half-dozen songs are a gauntlet of parties, worries, and venting sessions about toxic relationships. One minute, it\u2019s celebrating the spoils of hard work in \u201cSaint-Tropez,\u201d and the next, it\u2019s linking with North Carolina sensation DaBaby for \u201cEnemies,\u201d a passive-aggressive jab at backstabbing friends that\u2019s sort of like a Bro Code version of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSorry.\u201d (DaBaby steals the show as usual: \u201cFriends are like the autumn / Every year they leaving / And I\u2019ma rake \u2019em in a pile, throw \u2019em in a bag / Tie them bitches up and leave \u2019em.\u201d) There\u2019s wistful notes in even the upbeat songs; divorced from the vivid, psychedelic colors of Into the Spider-Verse, soundtrack staple \u201cSunflower\u201d\u2019s words about overcoming trust and compatibility issues stand out as much as the melodies.\n\n\u201cSunflower\u201d exemplifies Hollywood\u2019s Bleeding\u2019s approach to genre. The album rearranges shards of rap, rock, punk, and dance music into its own images. There\u2019s peppy pop-rock confections and standard trap collaborations, nods to hip-hop\u2013soul and to house music. Post Malone is a sturdy bridge between Future and Halsey on \u201cDie for Me,\u201d and the SZA jam \u201cStaring at the Sun\u201d is a rewarding trip back to the well of jaunting R&B-pop powering \u201cSunflower.\u201d \u201cTake What You Want,\u201d a trap-rock tune featuring guest vocals from Ozzy Osbourne and Travis Scott, is a gem and a song only Post Malone would think to make. (When I met him during press for Stoney\u2019s \u201cToo Young,\u201d he told me he grew up on Metallica, Pantera, Biggie, 2pac, and OutKast, and he dreamed of matching Future with Texas country legend George Strait on the same song. Having Travis and Ozzy feature on \u201cTake What You Want\u201d is the apotheosis of this kind of thinking.) He\u2019s restructuring his sound a little with each album, and it\u2019s here that the artist\u2019s occasionally jibing sphere of interests produce something that feels perfectly natural in its contradictions.\n\nHollywood\u2019s Bleeding doesn\u2019t always stick the landing. There\u2019s around a dozen slight, pleasant sad-boy autumn jams in this batch of 17. \u201cOn the Road\u201d houses a killer Meek Mill verse but also rehashes bits of \u201cRockstar\u201d in the melody. The pop-rock jams \u201cAllergic,\u201d \u201cA Thousand Bad Times,\u201d and \u201cCircles\u201d sound like different drafts of the same song, scheduled in a row up top. Hollywood\u2019s Bleeding is Post Malone in a fitting room, trying new vibes on for size. Some work, and some don\u2019t, but the willingness to take risks is admirable, even though Post Malone\u2019s reluctance to be pigeonholed as a rapper seems to come from a place of feeling limited by the genre. There were never limits. Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys made room for punk and hard-rock sounds in hip-hop in the \u201980s. In the \u201990s, Rage Against the Machine cut rap with metal and Tribe brought jazz. In the aughts, OutKast and Kanye jammed soul, funk, prog, and ragtime in a blender. In this decade, Alchemist is making great beats out of yacht rock. Hip-hop is collage art. Any material suffices. There\u2019s no need to escape it when you can shape it to fit your needs. Hollywood\u2019s Bleeding is a step toward this realization and a solid plate of downcast sounds for the passage into fall.", "description": "Hollywood\u2019s Bleeding is Post Malone in a fitting room, trying new vibes on for size.
