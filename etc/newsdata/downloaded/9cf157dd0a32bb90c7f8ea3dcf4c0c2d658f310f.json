But last week, I won an auction for the Psion Series 5 \u2014 a 1997 personal digital assistant that looks more like a little laptop. Through the 1980s and 1990s, Psion was one of the trailblazers in PDAs and \u201cpalmtop\u201d computers. The Series 5\u2019s EPOC operating system turned into Symbian, a major mobile platform that was at one point virtually synonymous with Nokia\u2019s phones. People still praise Psion PDAs today, but I\u2019d never owned or used one. After opening a box in remarkably near-mint condition, I decided to write a draft review of the Psion, using the Psion. I almost succeeded.\n\nNo matter how dry and symbolic text might be, the way you write it matters. I\u2019ve spent a large part of my life messing around with different kinds of typewriters, paper, and (as an annoying ancient language-obsessed kid) clay tablets. If my photographer friends can experiment with film and DSLRs and light field cameras, why shouldn\u2019t I try to find an incredibly specific tool that gives me the writing experience I want? The MacBook Air fills that niche for tech reporting; I\u2019ve got a finely tuned ecosystem for turning words and photos into finished posts. But in my spare time, I want something that\u2019s solid, hyper-portable, and single-purpose.\n\nThe Psion Series 5 is bulky by 2015 mobile standards; it\u2019s more like a large Nintendo DS than a PalmPilot. But if you think of it as a laptop substitute, it's the most convenient thing I've ever carried. The screen doesn\u2019t just lift open like a clamshell laptop, it slides up and rotates into the body, so it never feels wobbly or fragile. The base holds a tiny stylus that pops out with a satisfying click, letting you use a resistive touch interface as well as a keyboard. There\u2019s also, oddly, a little slot with physical recording and playback buttons, so you can hold a black rubber brick to your face and take voice notes. It runs primarily on two AA batteries, which is a godsend for such an old device \u2014 I don\u2019t have to deal with a shot, 18-year-old proprietary battery. As a simple device with a monochrome screen, it\u2019s supposed to give you 25-35 hours of use for each set of batteries. Do you see words on this? That monochrome screen, however, is the Psion Series 5\u2019s big weakness \u2014 it\u2019s really, really bad. Bad compared to a computer. Bad compared to a graphing calculator. Bad compared to the light-up alarm clock I had when I was 10. It's both low-contrast and glossy, nearly unreadable under anything but artificial ambient light, unless you turn on a green backlight that I'm guessing eats battery fairly quickly. I\u2019d seen this in old reviews of the Series 5, but it's still impressively awful. Fortunately, just about all the other hardware feels wonderful. It\u2019s a plain but satisfying design, and if the screen looks terrible, it\u2019s at least very responsive to touch. The keys are larger and travel farther than some modern counterparts, although they\u2019re also very stiff \u2014 here\u2019s one of my earlier sections in its original form: \"The most immeditely notable thing abou the Pson Series 5 is tht its screeen is really, really bad. Bad compared to a computer, Bad compared to a graphing calculator, Bad cmpared to the light-up alarm clock I had when I was 10.\" Part of the issue is that it takes time to get used to any small keyboard. I have tiny enough fingers that I can type fairly well on the condensed design, but it relegates some important punctuation (like my beloved en-dashes) to awkward corners or secondary functions. Whatever its shortcomings, it's a fun little writing machine, smaller and more convenient than any laptop or tablet on the market.\n\nGetting what you write off the Psion is another story. The Psion series used infrared to sync with early mobile phones and a serial cable to connect to Windows 95/98/XP\u2019s PsiWin software. I had to do something its creators never planned for: pull files from a PDA running the proto-Symbian EPOC to a PC running Windows 8.1. Fortunately, the Psion is remembered fondly enough that I'm not the only person who wants to do that. You haven't really experienced what the internet has to offer until you've pieced together several different tutorials for getting 18-year-old software up and running. Syncing a Psion is like solving the Hellraiser puzzle box Even with the guides, it took me about an hour and a half (plus a serial-to-USB adapter that cost half as much as what I paid for the Psion itself) to transfer a file. Something that merited a scant two pages in the Psion's giant manual required extracting the virtual hard drive from Windows 7's defunct \"XP Mode,\" loading it into the VirtualBox emulator, loading drivers for the cables, finding a copy of PsiWin on the internet, synchronizing the baud and port settings across PC and Psion, realizing I'd accidentally unplugged the serial cable, restarting both VirtualBox and the Psion a couple of times, and finally setting up a shared folder to transfer obsolete Word-compatible documents containing my writing. Along the way, I remembered why I rarely consulted the gigantic instruction manuals that came with my old software: because they're completely useless. The Psion came with a spiral-bound book substantially larger than the actual computer, and it\u2019s great if you need help understanding that you can snooze an alarm by pressing the Snooze button. It\u2019s somewhat less helpful if anything at all goes wrong. Psion was so confident in its PC sync software that it didn't bother to explain half the settings. Interfaces haven't changed that much in the ensuing years \u2014 everything on the Psion was almost immediately recognizable \u2014 so maybe today's products don't explain menus and alarms because we\u2019re more familiar with basic design language. Or because a business-focused device needed obsessive documentation. Or because today\u2019s developers are just more willing to make us hunt for things. To a modern, casual user, there\u2019s not much to do besides write on the Psion. It\u2019s apparently possible to create and run custom programs on it, but in general, all its uses are marked right on the front: agenda, spreadsheet, sketchpad, world clock. There is also a version of Minesweeper called Bombs. I played it on the subway. It\u2019s okay.", "description": "No matter how dry and symbolic text might be, the way you write it matters.
