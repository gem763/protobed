Surveillance video entered into evidence during former officer Amber Guyger's criminal trial shows Sergeant Mike Mata leaning into a patrol car where Guyger was sitting after she killed Botham Jean.\n\nMata told another officer to turn off the car's dashboard camera. Prosecutors suggested Mata acted improperly.\n\nDuring the trial, Assistant District Attorney Jason Hermus said Mata didn't have the authority to turn the camera off. In an interview with CBS News correspondent Omar Villafranca, Mata defended his actions.\n\n\"The only reason I asked for that camera to be off is because the attorney was calling the officer, and that is attorney-client privilege, and that's a right every citizen has, regardless if you're a police officer or not,\" Mata told Villafranca. Dallas Police Chief Renee Hall has said she would launch an internal investigation into Mata's actions.\n\nMata said he welcomed the investigation because he said he didn't do anything wrong. Civil rights groups have called for Mata's firing, CBS station KTVT reports.\n\nGuyger was convicted of murdering Jean and sentenced to 10 years in prison this week. Her attorneys are expected to file an appeal.", "description": "Dallas Police Association president defends actions in immediate aftermath of white police officer Amber Guyger fatally shooting black neighbor Botham Jean", "authors": ["Alex Sundby", "Alex Sundis A Senior Editor For Cbsnews.Com", "Alex Sund"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/04/93f89ba9-4aad-48f9-8716-228df97b7601/thumbnail/1200x630g2/cca851c0e7ab096008b6a0d0a1d909f3/amber-guyger-surveillance-video.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
