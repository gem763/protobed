(AP) \u2014 North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum on Friday activated the state\u2019s emergency plan due to what he called a crippling snowstorm that closed major highways and had farmers and ranchers bracing for huge crop and livestock losses.\n\n\u201cThe extraordinary intensity of this early winter storm threatens to test the limits of local response capabilities across a large portion of our state,\u201d Burgum said of the plan that places on standby all agency resources, including the National Guard, to respond to weather-related emergencies.\n\nBurgum said the state would \u201censure our citizens have the resources necessary to respond and recover from this crippling event.\u201d\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning for northern North Dakota and winter storm warnings and watches elsewhere in the state and into parts of South Dakota and Minnesota through Saturday afternoon. One to 2 feet of snow was expected to accumulate Friday in parts of North Dakota with winds gusting up to 65 mph.\n\nDozens of schools in the Dakotas were closed Friday because of deteriorating travel conditions. That follows school closures and travel headaches Thursday in the Great Plains.\n\nHundreds of miles of miles of Interstates 29 and 94 and U.S. Highway 2 in North Dakota were closed on Friday due to severe winter conditions and poor visibility.\n\nHighway Patrol Sgt. Wade Kadrmas said no traffic fatalities had been reported as of Friday morning.\n\nCarl Jones, a weather-service meteorologist in Grand Forks, said the storm likely is historic. He said up to a foot of snow already had fallen through much of the state by Friday to be topped by up to 3 feet more later in the day.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m expecting massive crop losses \u2014 as devastating as we\u2019ve even seen.\u2019 Jon Nelson, Republican member of North Dakota House of Representatives\n\n\u201cThese are unheard of amounts for any time of year,\u201d he said.\n\nThe north-central and northeastern part of the state was taking the brunt of the storm but Bismarck, in the central North Dakota, had nearly a foot of snow by Friday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting massive crop losses \u2014 as devastating as we\u2019ve even seen,\u201d said Jon Nelson, a state lawmaker who farms several hundred acres near Rugby in north-central North Dakota.\n\nUnharvested wheat in the region probably will be a total loss, he said.\n\n\u201cA lot of the standing stuff is flattened to the ground,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s shot and some guys are putting their combines away and won\u2019t bring them out again.\u201d\n\nErika Kenner, who ranches with her parents in Leeds, North Dakota, said she felt helpless Friday as she was unable to check on the family\u2019s herd of several hundred cows due to deep, drifting snow.\n\n\u201cI just hear the wind howling and think of those poor cows out there,\u201d she said. \u201cCattle are tough, but this kind of weather just wears on them.\u201d", "description": "North Dakota governor activates emergency measures.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT186_south__ZG_20191011181144.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
