Time for Trump to leave Syrian oil to the Syrians", "language": "en", "text": "For all President Trump\u2019s talk of withdrawal, and ending the US\u2019 \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East, America will remain in Syria to keep its oil in the hands of Washington\u2019s favorite militias. Isn\u2019t it time to just let go?\n\nThe killing of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi by American special forces on Saturday was undoubtedly a foreign policy triumph for Trump, deflecting the criticism that followed his withdrawal of troops from northern Syria and compounding his claim to have \u201cobliterated his caliphate, 100 percent.\u201d\n\nBut no sooner had Trump taken his victory lap than he told reporters he would be \u201cleaving soldiers to secure the oil.\u201d So much for bringing the boys home.\n\nAlso on rt.com Syrian oil: US troops being deployed will strike at ANY force challenging occupation \u2013 SecDef\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper confirmed the US\u2019 new priority on Monday, telling reporters that US troops and armored vehicles are already en route to the oilfields of Deir ez-Zor, where they have been asked to \u201crespond with overwhelming military force against any group\u201d threatening them \u2013 including Russia and the Syrian government.\n\nPresident Trump is a blunt speaker, and often practices publicly what other leaders would prefer remain hidden. On one hand, the decision to remain behind for the oil\u2019s sake fits right in with Trump\u2019s transactional view of international relations. After all, this is the same president who complained that his predecessor didn\u2019t seize Iraqi oil fields as \u201creimbursement\u201d for the 2003 invasion (\u2018we\u2019ll invade them and they\u2019ll pay us to do it\u2019).\n\nAlso on rt.com Trump channels \u2018America invades for oil\u2019 meme as he says some troops will stay in Syria to \u2018protect\u2019 it\n\nOn the other, it bogs American troops down in a country he once referred to as \u201csand and death,\u201d contradicting his oft-repeated promise to extricate the US from Syria and quit playing the world\u2019s \u201cpoliceman.\u201d\n\nBut, if the oilfield mission is taken at face value, Washington isn\u2019t even going to profit from the oil. Though Trump teased the prospect of getting American oil companies involved in its extraction, Esper on Monday claimed that the US will only ensure that the black gold remains in the hands of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), and out of the hands of IS.\n\nFew would argue with keeping the oil in the hands of the Kurds, especially as the SDF have long assisted Washington in the fight against IS, and contributed intelligence to the raid on Baghdadi\u2019s compound on Saturday. The oil guarantee could also be seen as compensation to the Kurds, following the US\u2019 withdrawal that left them at the mercy of a Turkish military operation earlier this month.\n\nAlso on rt.com Russian MoD says US protects oil smugglers in Syria, offers aerial images as proof\n\nExcept Deir ez-Zor is Syrian land. The oil under the ground there is Syrian oil. And Syria, officially, remains under the rule of President Bashar Assad. The United States is not technically at war with Assad, its presence in Syria is not sanctioned by international law, and even if the US were leading an internationally recognized military campaign against Assad, seizing oil is not legal under the American definition of the \u2018spoils of war.\u2019\n\nAnd to top it off, there\u2019s no inkling that Islamic State, or what remains of the group, will even threaten the sites. Asked on Monday if the oilfields and their American protectors were under any threat, Esper replied \u201cnot at this time.\u201d\n\nThough Syria is not a major producer, oil sales accounted for a quarter of the state\u2019s revenue and were projected to net the government $3.2 billion in 2010, before the outbreak of war. Now, with much of the country in ruins, oil sales could be a vital lifeline for the nation\u2019s rebuilding. With the US denying everyone bar the Kurds access to at least some of this oil, that recovery is hampered.\n\nAlso on rt.com Trump\u2019s Syria \u2018oil gambit\u2019 is a crime, and what may be worse \u2013 a mistake\n\nThe military defeat of IS and the violent death of its depraved leader have presented Trump with the perfect opportunity to make good on his campaign pledge to get out of the \u201cbloodstained sand\u201d of the Middle East. Endless war and occupation are the legacies of the Bush administration, and the preserve of war hawks like John Bolton and Lindsey Graham.\n\nTime to declare mission accomplished and leave Syria to the Syrians.\n\nBy Graham Dockery, RT\n\nLike this story?
