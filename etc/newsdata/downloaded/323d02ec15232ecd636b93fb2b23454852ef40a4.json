They\u2019re all available through traditional audio platforms, like Apple Podcasts and Spotify, but many also offer video versions that live on dedicated YouTube channels where they\u2019ve become incredibly popular.\n\nThese creators have figured out how to make podcasts work on a platform that wasn\u2019t designed for them, leveraging YouTube\u2019s search algorithm to meet new audiences, make more money, and expand into a medium that\u2019s expected to grow rapidly in the coming years.\n\nDespite being a video-focused platform, people are increasingly coming to YouTube to look for podcasts. A recent survey of Canadian adults found that 43 percent of people \u201cwent to YouTube for podcasts in the past year.\u201d That put YouTube ahead of Apple Podcasts (34 percent) and Spotify (23 percent).\n\nQuestions about whether YouTube videos listed as podcasts are, in fact, podcasts have arisen\n\nSome of the top podcasts on YouTube are pulling in millions of views every few days or weeks. Top shows, like Ethan and Hila Klein\u2019s H3 Podcast or Joe Rogan\u2019s Joe Rogan Experience, have dedicated audiences who use YouTube notifications as an RSS feed, letting them know when a new episode is available to watch. While the podcasts are also distributed via Spotify and Apple Podcasts, YouTube acts as a first stop.\n\nTo reach even bigger audiences, YouTubers have figured out that they can break their show into pieces and spread it across multiple channels. H3 Podcast, Cody Ko and Noel Miller\u2019s Tiny Meat Gang, and The Joe Rogan Experience run as full-length episodes on their main podcast channel, but those episodes are then broken down into tiny individual cuts. These cuts, often referred to as clips or highlights, exist on a completely separate channel. They\u2019re also arguably more important when it comes to using YouTube as a way to grow the podcast.\n\nThe H3 Podcast uses one of the most popular takes on the \u201cYouTube podcast\u201d format. Ethan and Hila Klein have three channels: H3H3 Productions (6 million subscribers), H3 Podcast (2 million subscribers), and H3 Podcast Highlights (1.3 million subscribers). The main channel is used for longer commentary pieces, special collaborations, and comedic sketches, but the latter two are solely dedicated to the podcast. The main H3 Podcast channel has more than 208 million total views, but the secondary channel that\u2019s dedicated to clips from each episode has more than 388 million total views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing opportunity to build a new audience and maybe reach more than one million subscribers.\u201d\n\nCreating a separate channel for clips lets podcasters take advantage of YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithm, which surfaces content on specific subjects a viewer is already interested in. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing opportunity to build a new audience,\u201d Samir Chaudry, a filmmaker and part of YouTube duo Colin and Samir, told The Verge, discussing the ability to bring in new subscribers with podcasts.\n\nTake a recent episode of the H3 Podcast as an example. The main title, \u201cH3 Podcast: Andrew Yang\u201d will surface for anyone who types in Yang\u2019s name. That might appeal to people looking for a wide-ranging discussion with Yang, but the length (close to 90 minutes) and lack of specific topics of conversation in the title could push people away. So on the H3 Podcast Highlights page, the interview has been broken apart into nine separate clips. The clips range from five to 20 minutes, and they\u2019ve amassed anywhere from 70,000 to 555,000 views. Because they\u2019re shorter, they\u2019re easier to watch and share, letting the podcast spread beyond H3\u2019s existing audience.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been this question about how to market the podcast,\u201d Owen Grover, CEO of Pocket Casts, told The Verge. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to me that some of these young YouTube-centric producers and creators ... are looking at different ways to get their content to travel, like separate channels.\u201d\n\nEach clip taps into a specific part of the podcast that can then spread beyond both the \u2018H3 podcast\u2019 audience\n\nThat same strategy is part of what\u2019s made Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast such a success on YouTube. Rogan\u2019s show is one of the longest on the platform, often going beyond three hours, and like H3, he operates a secondary channel that breaks out clips from each episode. The clips collectively have more views than the videos on his main account, despite the clips channel having several million fewer subscribers.\n\n\u201cJoe Rogan is a perfect example,\u201d Grover said. \u201cHe does the two- to three-hour \u2018wake me when it\u2019s over\u2019 version, and then there are short little clips that he puts up.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also been easy for popular creators with built-in audiences to move their existing fans over to new channels. David Dobrik and Jason Nash, a pair of popular vloggers with 14 million collective subscribers, host a podcast called Views that gets more than a million downloads an episode from audio listeners alone, according to Dobrik. A YouTube channel for their podcast has more than 550,000 subscribers.\n\nPodcasting has also been a rare case where YouTube\u2019s quirks all seem to align for individual creators. They can expand their audience without turning off their existing one, and it makes money from ad revenue at a time when uncertainty over what content is monetizable on YouTube is a growing concern.\n\n\u201cI think podcasting, in particular, is an obvious next step for creators.\u201d\n\nKeeping a podcast on a separate channel allows creators to work on two different types of content. People who subscribe to someone for vlogs, pranks, or comedy, may be turned off by a lengthy talk or interview show being injected into their feed.\n\nIt also lets them try to speak to new audiences. Logan Paul, the vlogger best known for his controversial videos, has a podcast channel with more than 1.7 million subscribers. The content is a little more mature, the videos are longer, and the subject matter is different than anything on his main channel. With guests like mathematician Eric Weinstein, the podcast has a chance to attract a more mature group of listeners than those who watch Paul\u2019s hyper-energetic vlogging channel.\n\nCreators know that YouTube is a valuable tool for developing and growing podcasts, but YouTube hasn\u2019t implemented any product changes to embrace the development. Instead, the communal growth that personalities are seeing comes from their initiatives, collaborations, and understanding of how to use YouTube to their advantage.\n\n\u201cPodcasting is already growing at such a steady and substantial rate, but it feels like YouTube continues to push people right into the arms of new media,\u201d Grover said. \u201cI think podcasting, in particular, is an obvious next step for creators.\u201d", "description": "More YouTube creators are getting into the podcast game, including Ethan Klein, David Dobrik, Joe Rogan, and Marques Brownlee.
