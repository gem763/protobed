Here are 5 reasons the firm's top US stock strategist is betting on a rally.", "language": "en", "text": "Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, JPMorgan's chief US equity strategist, says the energy sector is due for a rally after being neglected for much of the year.\n\nHe said the sector has largely been abandoned, even though oil prices have surged since late 2018. But with global economic growth likely to improve in the months ahead, he sees a lot of room for improvement.\n\nOil prices this month briefly soared after Saudi Arabia's oil refineries were attacked, but even that failed to set off a sustained rally in the sector.\n\nClick here for more BI Prime stories.\n\nThe rest of the stock market has left energy companies in the dust this year, and JPMorgan's chief US equity strategist says that sentiment has stretched to an unreasonable extent.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, it's a fact of life that if oil prices are rising, energy companies are on the rise as well. That has not only not happened, but they've also moved in opposite directions all year, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas said.\n\n\"While Oil has recovered ~32% from last December low, Large-cap E&Ps are hovering near December lows and Small-cap E&Ps have declined by another -20%,\" he said in a recent client note.\n\nBut Lakos-Bujas isn't simply arguing that the sector is undervalued. He said there was a series of attributes to like about energy companies that, when combined, create a real opportunity.\n\n\"We believe favorable technicals, improving fundamentals with stabilizing business cycle, and ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could help redirect flows into this universally hated and cheap sector,\" he wrote.\n\nHe broke down five reasons energy stocks are positioned for a recovery. Investors who want exposure to the sector can achieve it through the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF.\n\n1. Positioning is very low\n\nHere's what Lakos-Bujas meant when he said the sector was hated: Systematic funds are shorting oil, institutional investors have \"abandoned\" the energy sector, and factor-investing trends aren't bullish on energy companies either. Add that up, and some companies are abnormally inexpensive.\n\n\"Absolute and relative valuations are at lows with small-cap E&Ps trading below book value and at price levels seen almost 25 years ago,\" he said.\n\n2. Returns are improving\n\nEnergy-sector returns are improving, as companies throughout the industry have increased their dividends this year and low stock prices have encouraged more buybacks. That combination of falling prices and growing returns means yields for energy companies have jumped to 3.9%.\n\nEnergy executives and leaders seem optimistic about how the stocks will perform.\n\n\"We find it encouraging that corporate managers are finding value in this sector with insider buying activity hitting an all-time high,\" Lakos-Bujas said.\n\nRead more: 'Invest in what's scarce': Famed economist David Rosenberg explains how the average trader can supercharge returns in a tumultuous market\n\n3. Middle East tensions are up\n\nUsually, turmoil in the Middle East drives up oil prices and energy stocks. The drone attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities caused a big spike in oil prices that quickly faded, and there hasn't been much movement in energy companies. Lakos-Bujas said this didn't make much sense.\n\n\"Two-thirds of Energy companies are trading below pre-attack levels,\" he said. \"The market should assign a structural premium to the equity-oil complex with the Middle East currently a geopolitical tinderbox.\"\n\nHe added that it was not clear if there would be a military response to the attack, and it would take months before all of Saudi Arabia's refining capacity is functional again.\n\n4. Improving growth\n\nOil prices have been hurt by investors' worries about the ongoing US-China trade war and related concerns about the weakening global economy. But Lakos-Bujas said economic growth was likely to pick up in the next few months as the result of monetary easing and economic stimulus from central banks around the world.\n\nHe expects trade tensions to ease as the 2020 presidential election approaches. That would help the global economy by encouraging businesses and consumers to spend.\n\n\"Energy-equities would be a direct beneficiary of improving global growth, tighter oil supply/demand, and weaker USD,\" he wrote.\n\nRead more: The cofounder of $300 billion private-equity behemoth Apollo outlines 4 mistakes the average investor makes \u2014 and explains how he takes advantage\n\n5. Unappreciated upside\n\nLakos-Bujas reasons that the market collectively expects oil prices to rise about $5 a barrel next year \u2014 but because of high leverage in the sector, shares of energy companies will see outsize gains if oil prices rise further than that.\n\nOverall, that means companies will continue to increase their buyback and dividend returns, and that suggests the multiples on energy stocks should be higher than they are.\n\n\"Since S&P 500 Energy has higher quality integrated and refiners, pure-play E&P and Service should see even stronger growth under higher oil scenarios,\" he said.\n\nOne way investors can get exposure to oil and gas companies is through the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration Production ETF, while a way to invest in refinery operators is the VanEck Vectors Oil Refiners ETF.
