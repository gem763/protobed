He has a young coaching staff and the club needs to hold their nerve.\n\n\"They need to give him the money in the transfer window that previous managers at this club have had.\n\n\"Solskjaer needs to make sure he is the manager to exploit from this clean up he is doing.\n\n\"I don't know what the mandate is. I am hoping they have told him they will back him for three or four transfer windows.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"There has been a step back to go forward. I can see a logic to things.\n\n\"I don't believe the man at the top (Ed Woodward) should be there to do it anymore. He has had his chance.\"\n\nDespite Neville's backing for Solskjaer, colleague Jamie Redknapp claimed they must be considering how much time they are willing to give him to turn things around.\n\n\"When he replaced Mourinho, you thought it was a new dawn. United looked a good side under him,\" Redknapp said.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"But they have gone back to type. The three signings have been good.\n\n\"This is their worst start in 30 years. He is a very lucky man to get the job - he has managed Molde and Cardiff .\"\n\nDo you give him time? There comes a time where, if this carries on, you can't. It is impossible.\n\n\"The problem is, who is out there?\n\n\"This is a very difficult job. That transition, trying to win the league and dominate again.\"", "description": "Gary Neville believes Man Utd need to commit to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in the transfer window despite their struggles", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20006816.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Aston-Villa-v-Everton-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
