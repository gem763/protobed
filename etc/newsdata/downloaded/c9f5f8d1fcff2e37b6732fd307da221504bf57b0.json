She's 6 years old now,\" said Mazie.\n\nSt. Barnabas said in a statement it would not comment: \"This matter involves a private group in litigation. RWJBH does not comment on matters in litigation.\"\n\nThe hospital has 30 days to respond to the filing.\n\nABC News' Leo Mayorga and Matt Foster contributed to this report.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
