He later defended it as a \u201cwhimsical device.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry on Tuesday slammed Navarro\u2019s \u201clies,\u201d and said he has \u201cthreaten[ed] and undermine[d] normal international relations and order.\u201d\n\nNavarro mocked China in responses, telling CNN: \u201cA source close to Ron Vara indicates China has revoked his visa and lowered his social credit score.\u201d\n\nHe also joked that China \u201chas banned all anagrams and humor in social media and non-fiction books.\u201d\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s top trade adviser mocked the Chinese government after it criticized him for inventing a fake expert to bash China in his books.\n\nPeter Navarro was found earlier this month to have cited a supposed Harvard-educated investor and China hawk named \u201cRon Vara\u201d in his publications. Ron Vara turned out to be a nonexistent person, an anagram of Navarro\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cVara\u201d is cited in many of Navarro\u2019s books on economics, and has been quoted giving an extreme picture of the threat that China poses to the world economy.\n\nAustralian National University academic Tessa Morris-Suzuki first discovered that Vara didn\u2019t exist when she tried to verify whether he attended Harvard or existed anywhere outside Navarro\u2019s books.\n\nRead more: Trump\u2019s top trade advisor Peter Navarro\u2019s books frequently cite a made-up scholar named \u2018Ron Vara\u2019 who appears to be his alter ego\n\ncaption A selection of White House trade adviser Peter Navarro\u2019s books on economics. References to \u201cRon Vara\u201d have been found in \u201cDeath by China\u201d and \u201cIf it\u2019s Raining in Brazil, Buy Starbucks.\u201d source Google\n\nNavarro has since admitted to inventing Vara, but claimed that the name is a \u201cwhimsical device and pen name\u201d that didn\u2019t serve as a factual source for his work.\n\nThe Washington Post pointed out on Tuesday that Navarro uses multiple fictional characters in his books, but never explicitly said that Vara was not real.\n\nChina on Tuesday slammed Navarro\u2019s \u201clies\u201d about the fake expert, saying that they \u201cwill threaten and undermine normal international relations and order.\u201d\n\nNavarro has been leading US efforts to negotiate a trade deal with China, which has still not come after months of deadlock and tariffs imposed on billions of dollars\u2019 worth of US and Chinese goods. He has consistently supported raising tariffs on China.\n\nThe US and China struck a partial trade pact last week \u2013 but China has said that the US needs to lift tariffs before they can strike a fuller trade deal.\n\nRead all of Business Insider\u2019s coverage of the US-China trade war here.\n\ncaption President Donald Trump with (2nd L-R) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro source Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nHua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, told reporters: \u201cFrankly, this case triggered strong responses and astonishment worldwide. On some level, it shows that out of personal or political hidden intentions, certain people in the US can do whatever they can think of to contain and smear China without scruple.\u201d\n\nIn his 2011 book \u201cDeath by China,\u201d Navarro had cited Vara as saying \u201conly the Chinese can turn a leather sofa into an acid bath, a baby crib into a lethal weapon, and a cellphone battery into heart-piercing shrapnel.\u201d\n\nHua said: \u201cIt is absurd and extremely dangerous to make lies, spread lies and even formulate policies based on lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch moves will threaten and undermine normal international relations and order. Apart from that, the US will hurt its own interests in the end,\u201d she said.\n\nNavarro appeared unfazed by China\u2019s comments, and issued a statement mocking the China.\n\nHe told CNN: \u201cA source close to Ron Vara indicates China has revoked his visa and lowered his social credit score. In a related event, the Ministry of State Security has banned all anagrams and humor in social media and non-fiction books.\u201d\n\nHis comments refer to China\u2019s controversial social credit system, which attempts to reward or punish citizens according to their behavior, and the country\u2019s strict censorship of what it deems offensive content.\n\nThe White House and the US embassies in Washington and London have not yet responded to Business Insider\u2019s request for comment on Navarro\u2019s remarks.\n\nsource Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe spokeswoman went on to accuse the US of lying \u201cto fuel the wars in Iraq and Syria\u201d and to criticize China over its actions in the oppressed region of Xinjiang, its response to the Hong Kong protests, the dangers of China-made 5G technology, and the country\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nBeijing has long told foreign countries to stay out of national issues.\n\n\u201cWe hope the international community including you, my journalist friends, will learn something from this case and carefully examine the ideas and views that certain people in the US are so desperately disseminating in their propaganda,\u201d Hua said.", "description": "Business Insider - Peter Navarro invented a fake expert named \"Ron Vara\" and cited him sharing exaggerated threats about China's economy in his books..
