He's having a scan as a precaution,\" England scrum coach Neal Hatley told a news conference on Monday.\n\n\"He's walking around with a smile on his face -- but it's nearly lunchtime so he's happy.\"\n\nShould Vunipola be unavailable, he could be replaced by Mark Wilson at number eight in Yokohama as Eddie Jones' side look to head into the quarter-finals with their 100% record intact.\n\nFrance\n\nTeam news to follow.\n\nWhat is the head to head record of both sides?\n\nThere have been 105 meetings between the two sides - England winning 58, France claiming 40 victories.\n\nThey have met in the Rugby World Cup five times - England winning three and France twice.\n\nTheir most recent meeting was in the 2019 Six Nations, where England were 44-8 winners.\n\nWhat are they saying?\n\nJamie George\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Eddie made us aware of it when Billy came off at half-time. He said there will potentially be a little more responsibility for the other guys to step up and want the ball,\" George said.\n\n\"You work towards the ball all the time anyway. Whenever he sees me and Billy as an option, the scrum-half just passes it to Billy anyway which is probably fair enough!\n\n\"If he does or doesn't play then we're all aware that we need to get our hands on the ball and impose ourselves physically.\"\n\nFrance coach Jacques Brunel\n\n\"What matters tonight is the qualification,\" he said.\n\n\"That was our first goal: it was not easy. There were stages to pass. We passed them: sometimes with difficulty - but we passed them.\n\n\"The first thing to secure, is the qualification, which fully satisfied us.\"\n\nOn the game he added: \"They attacked the game well, had some good chances to score in the first half.\n\n\"We wanted to make a better copy. There is still work (to do).\"\n\nWhat are the betting odds?\n\nEngland - 1/6\n\nFrance - 5/1\n\nDraw - 28/1\n\nWhat is our prediction?\n\nFrance have improved since suffering a thrashing at Twickenham in February but England should be good enough for a comfortable win even if they rest front-liners.\n\nPrediction: England 32 France 20", "description": "England vs France, the final Rugby World Cup 2019 Pool C clash which will determine who finishes top.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fpftVQh5irb35HGBZ0pBnA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMjg7aD03Njg-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/matzbFK.0tIBgd8Y5Q2feA--~B/aD0zODQ7dz02MTQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/eab16e712621065766bb76b5b85a6e0d", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
