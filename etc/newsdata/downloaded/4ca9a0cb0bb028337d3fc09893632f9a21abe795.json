So it is important to create jobs and activities that generate income, while protecting the environment and helping people to emerge from poverty,\u201d he declared.\n\nThe pontiff tied together social and ecological problems, insisting that the two are intimately intertwined.\n\n\u201cWe are faced not with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, but rather with one complex crisis which is both social and environmental,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn a word, there can be no true ecological approach or effective efforts to safeguard the environment without the attainment of a social justice capable of respecting the right to the common destination of earth\u2019s goods, not only of present generations, but also of those yet to come,\u201d he said.\n\nPope Francis has made the care of the environment a central theme of his six-year pontificate, returning again and again to issues of ecological responsibility, the dangers of carbon emissions, and the scourge of climate change.\n\nIn 2015, he became the first pope in history to devote an entire encyclical letter to the topic of the environment with the publication of Laudato Si (\u201cPraised Be\u201d), urging Christians to become more ecologically aware.\n\nIn that text, the pontiff said that the earth \u201cis beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth\u201d as \u201conce beautiful landscapes are now covered with rubbish.\u201d\n\nHe also denounced a failure to recycle paper and other resources, while calling climate change \u201ca global problem with grave implications\u201d and \u201cone of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day.\u201d\n\nCiting \u201cscientific studies,\u201d the pontiff said that \u201cmost global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly as a result of human activity.\u201d\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome.", "description": "Pope Francis continued his ecological campaign in Madagascar this weekend while warning of a loss of biodiversity.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
