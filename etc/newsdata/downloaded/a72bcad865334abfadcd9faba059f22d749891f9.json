There, the advocate and author \u201creally lets fly,\u201d she tells InStyle. It\u2019s where she introduces herself as an \u201cex-beret model\u201d and \u201crap song muse\u201d (as well as TED-talk giver and Vanity Fair contributor). It\u2019s where, after so many years of a narrative told wrong, we finally get to know who she really is.\n\n\u201cOver the past several years, social media has really provided me a chance for people to see my true self,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very funny to think back to when I first started on Twitter, I wouldn\u2019t post anything without showing it to at least two people \u2014 I was so petrified to post.\u201d That\u2019s not just because of the residual trauma from being made tabloid fodder in the formative years of her adulthood, but because now, in present day, social media can be a pretty terrible place to spend your time.\n\nTo that end, together with New York-based ad agency BBDO, Lewinsky has released a dark, cinematic PSA with a surprising interactive twist. She\u2019s released three anti-bullying campaigns over the last three years \u2014 one, which brought digital bullying behavior into the real world, was even nominated for an Emmy. This time, it\u2019s better to just watch it, and experience the story unfolding for yourself.\n\nLewinsky\u2019s role in the creative vision of \u201cThe Epidemic\u201d was that of emotional shepherd. \u201cThere are experiences I\u2019ve had where the emotional imprint has sort of been threaded into the tapestry of the PSA,\u201d she says. \u201cI dipped into very personal and old places to help bring some emotional context to this.\u201d In the video, a teen girl is watching the news and hearing of an \u201cepidemic\u201d that\u2019s spreading. We see her become ill, running out of class to the bathroom at school one day; telling her mom she needs to stay home another. All the while, she\u2019s clutching her phone. Viewers have to follow the prompt at the end of the ad and go to this link to see what, exactly, is going on there.\n\n[Content warning: This video includes a depiction of self-harm that may be difficult for some to watch.]\n\nIt\u2019s that moment on the couch in which Monica Lewinsky saw herself, and felt most strongly about getting a message across.\n\n\u201cThe intensity of the texts that she\u2019s receiving and the pace at which she starts to receive them, somebody who\u2019s been crumbling emotionally because of the weight of the experience she\u2019s going through, that is where I pushed really hard that it was important to me that people feel and understand the weight of that experience,\u201d Lewinsky says. To get the feeling of bombardment across, she adds, \u201cI took the team through the day the Starr report came out and what my experience was of that.\u201d\n\nBelow, more of Lewinsky\u2019s insight into the epidemic her latest ad seeks to cure, and the brass tacks of how she stays so active \u2014 and still has a good time \u2014 on social media.\n\nDrafts, block, mute: How she keeps social media safe (and fun):\n\nI joke about this but this is also true: I utilize my drafts folder. I don\u2019t ever want to give a false impression that I don\u2019t have a wrong thought or a catty thought, because I do, and that\u2019s a realistic thing to being human and realizing that we\u2019re going to have some of these tendencies \u2014 but how do we curb them?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to practice what I preach sometimes. I\u2019m a huge fan of blocking and muting people. I probably block more than I mute; that feels more empowering to me. I know a lot of other people feel muting is more empowering, they the love idea of someone screaming into a void.\n\nRELATED: How to Make Social Media Less Depressing\n\nOn what gets people blocked or muted:\n\nI don\u2019t mind people criticizing me for things that are true. I have a really hard time with people who propagate false narratives about me that usually have to do with my past, things that make me start to feel bad about myself. I do a really good job of that all on my own, I don\u2019t need other people to. But I chip away at the shame every day.\n\nWe\u2019re having to work at this issue, to chip away coming at it from different places, and while we\u2019re trying to help shift social behavior from other people who are choosing to engage in bullying behavior and online harassment, we can also shift the way think about how much empowerment we have. I wish none of that happened and nobody had to experience those things, but we are empowered. We do have ways to change that.
