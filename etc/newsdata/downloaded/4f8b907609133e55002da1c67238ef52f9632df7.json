The numbers were growing, underlining the damage from Hagibis, which means \"speed\" in the Philippine language of Tagalog.\n\nNews footage showed a rescue helicopter hovering in a flooded area in Nagano Prefecture, after an embankment of the Chikuma River broke, plucking people from the second floor of a home submerged in muddy waters.\n\nSeveral other rivers had also overflowed, including Tama River near Tokyo, according to NHK.\n\nAuthorities warned that the risk of mudslides remained.\n\nSome train service in the Tokyo area, much of which had halted, resumed from early morning, although others were undergoing safety checks and were expected to start later in the day.\n\nThe World Rugby Cup match between Namibia and Canada, scheduled for Sunday in Kamaishi, northern Japan, was canceled as a precautionary measure for safety reasons.\n\nThe matches for Saturday had been canceled. Stores and amusement parks had been closed.\n\nThe usually crowded train stations and streets of Tokyo were abandoned as people were advised to stay indoors. But life was quickly returning to normal under clear sunny skies.\n\nAbout 17,000 police and military troops had been standing ready for rescue operations, under government orders.\n\nEvacuation centers had been set up in coastal towns, and tens of thousands of people had evacuated, praying their homes were still there after the storm passed.\n\nThe typhoon disrupted a three-day weekend in Japan that includes Sports Day on Monday. Qualifying for a Formula One auto race in Suzuka was pushed from Saturday to Sunday.\n\nThe authorities had repeatedly warned Hagibis was on par with a typhoon that hit the Tokyo region in 1958. But the safety benefits that Japan's modernization had brought were apparent. The typhoon six decades ago had left more than 1,200 people dead and half a million houses flooded.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
