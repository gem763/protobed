People are stuck between war and peace, between what came before \u2013 the optimism and freedom of defeating the Islamic State caliphate \u2013 and the unknowns of what comes next as Russian, Syrian and Turkish troops move in and U.S. troops move out.\n\nFor the moment, everything is being held together by a fragile cease-fire, which few Syrians here think will hold.\n\nRussian forces are mobilizing across northern Syria not far from where we are, by air and by land \u2013 filling the U.S. vacuum and deploying along parts of the Turkish border, part of their agreement to carve up the region with Turkey. Now, they\u2019re insisting all U.S. troops must leave Syria.\n\nBut in a surprise announcement, and one which could drastically change the fast-changing dynamic yet again, U.S. officials now tell Fox News the Pentagon has been looking to send armored units, including tanks, back in \u2013 supposedly to guard oil fields.\n\nPresident Trump later tweeted, \u201cPerhaps it is time for the Kurds to start heading to the Oil Region!\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, Defense Secretary Mark Esper lashed out at Turkey: \"Look, I've been very candid about this. Turkey put us all in a very terrible situation. I think the incursion was unwarranted.\u201d\n\nHe added that Turkey was \u201cheading in the wrong direction,\u201d drawing closer to Russia.\n\nBut Kurdish leaders, out of necessity, have been looking to Russia for protection. Gen. Mazloun Abdi, the commander-in-chief of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), spoke to Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu via Skype on Thursday, saying, \u201cI would like to appreciate specifically President Putin\u2019s efforts in protecting our people and stopping the military operations.\u201d\n\nPENTAGON 'LIKELY' DEPLOYING TANKS TO SYRIA, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nThat came a day after he thanked Trump, saying through a spokesman he was grateful for the president's \"tireless efforts that stopped the brutal Turkish attack and jihadist groups on our people.\u201d\n\nStill, Turkish jihadist proxies were carrying out some attacks on Thursday, clearly violating that cease-fire with mortars, drone strikes and gunfire. It remains to be seen if these escalate or not, but many people here have acknowledged this has been a delicate time.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement Thursday, \u201cThe situation is still fragile, but at least we have seen some progress by the fact that we have seen reduction in violence over the last days.\u201d\n\nAcross northern Syria, streets and shops have remained empty with over 100,000 displaced. The Kurds simply have not trusted Turkey to maintain the cease-fire and have continued to look for protection wherever they they can find it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd so the Kurds are waiting to see what happens next. When ISIS fell, thanks in large part to them, they looked forward with optimism to setting up a free, democratic and liberal homeland. That hope has gone \u2013 and it\u2019s not clear yet who or what will replace it.\n\nFox News will be on the ground as the story unfolds.", "description": "There\u2019s a strange feeling across Northern Syria.
