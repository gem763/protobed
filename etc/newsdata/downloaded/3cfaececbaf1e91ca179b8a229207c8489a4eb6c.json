(Reuters) - A large digital screen alongside a major highway running into Charleston, South Carolina, issued a stark warning to residents on Wednesday: \u2018HURRICANE DORIAN, LEAVE NOW.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: People walk along the waterfront ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Dorian in Charleston, South Carolina, U.S., September 4, 2019. REUTERS/Randall Hill/File Photo\n\nA large number of people had already heeded that warning, as could be seen at busy gasoline stations on the city\u2019s outskirts.\n\nAt one, drivers lined up calmly for snacks and fuel ahead of a journey inland.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen many worse storms than Dorian over the years, but we figured we wouldn\u2019t take any chances, so we\u2019re going to stay with family away from the coast,\u201d said George Wilson, 42, as he waited to buy candy and chocolate for his children.\n\nBut while tens of thousands of residents had decided to evacuate, many others in Charleston were choosing to ride out the storm.\n\nDorian has devastated parts of the Bahamas and killed at least seven people, where the scope of the destruction was still coming into focus on Wednesday.\n\nThe storm\u2019s wind speeds dropped on Tuesday to make it a Category 2 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson intensity scale. It maintained that level on Wednesday, but forecasters warned it was still dangerous.\n\nSouth Carolina officials said they were expecting storm surges of 4 to 8 feet (1.2 to 2.4 metres) and wind gusts of 90 miles per hour (145 kph) on Thursday, and told people to evacuate the coast as Dorian drew closer.\n\nBusiness owners and residents were busy boarding up shops on Wednesday in Charleston\u2019s historic district, but said they were used to doing so as hurricanes have become such a regular occurrence here.\n\n\u201cThis has pretty much become an annual ritual for us,\u201d said Micah Elliott, co-founder of Charleston Built, who has boarded up about 15 homes and businesses for clients.\n\nElliot was helping Kevin Leprince, 48, a local artist, board up his art gallery in the historic district. Leprince said his gallery should be safe from the storm surge, but he was worried that flooding from the expected heavy rain could damage his artwork.\n\nCloser to the waterfront, Mark Huske was placing sandbags along the windows of an architect\u2019s office. Huske said that if the storm surge hit as expected, it would flood the office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to get very messy down here,\u201d he said. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know why anyone would buy a house down here. It\u2019s pretty much guaranteed to flood.\u201d\n\n\u2018SEEN MUCH BIGGER THAN THIS\u2019\n\nA crowd of tourists and local residents strolled along the Charleston waterfront, unfazed by the intermittent rain, taking photographs and cheering dolphins that surfaced in the Ashley River.\n\nDanny Davis and his wife, Octavia, stood under a large umbrella enjoying the view on the waterfront and said that other than buying extra water and supplies, they had made few major preparations for Dorian.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen much bigger than this. Dorian is going to be nothing special,\u201d Danny Davis said.\n\nCharleston has suffered damage from a number of storms over the years, including flooding from Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricane Matthew in 2016, and a major battering from Hurricane Hugo in 1989.\n\nThe owners of Ink & Ivy, a bar in the historic district, decided to stay open throughout Dorian. The bar was busy on Wednesday afternoon and bartender Gregory Wilder, 41, said he expected a good crowd for the evening.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Coreyanna Moore of Charleston adds the latest named storm to hurricane boards ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Dorian in Charleston, South Carolina, U.S., September 4, 2019.
