We were knocking him on his back, telling him, 'It's okay. You got hit by lightning'.\"\n\nSecurity cameras at the clinic captured the whole episode, including the arrival of paramedics, who put Mr Coreas onto a stretcher and placed him on an air ambulance.\n\n(Image: Stuebner Airline Veterinary Hosp)\n\n(Image: ABC13)\n\nThe dog walker is currently in an intensive care unit and suffering from burns and serious pain.\n\nHis family said: \"He sustained very serious injuries but by the grace of God he is alive. It is a miracle and a blessing that he is alive.\n\n\"Bill Wilson, a vet technician from Stuebner Airline Veterinary Hospital found him without a heartbeat.\n\n(Image: Stuebner Airline Veterinary Hosp)\n\n(Image: Go Fnd Me)\n\n\"At this time he was found dead and immediately Mr Wilson started CPR. Corey Hart also helped. Mr Hart and Mr Wilson took turns during chest compressions. Christy Mittler also helped.\"\n\nHis sister wrote on a GoFundMe page: \"It is with great sadness that he has lost hearing on his left ear. He has burn marks from the lightning strike following his chest down to his thigh and on his left foot.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Coreas is now able to stand and hoping to start physical therapy in the near future.", "description": "Alexander Coreas was brought back to life after he was struck down by lightning while walking his dogs in Spring, Texas", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Go Fnd Me", "Stuebner Airline Veterinary Hosp"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20527789.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Alexander-Coreas-was-struck-by-lightning-while-walking-his-German-Shepherds.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
