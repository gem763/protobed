REUTERS/Stringer\n\nNearly 300 men and boys had been at the facility in the Daura area of Katsina, the home town of President Muhammadu Buhari, where police said they discovered \u201cinhuman and degrading treatments\u201d following a raid to free the remaining students.\n\nIt was the second such school in less than a month to be raided by police, after hundreds were freed from similarly degrading conditions in neighbouring Kaduna state.\n\nThe 67 inmates who were freed by Katsina police were shackled in chains, and many were taken to hospital for treatment, police superintendent Isah Gambo told Reuters.\n\n\u201cI tell you they were in very bad condition when we met them,\u201d Gambo said.\n\nA freed captive told Reuters on Monday that the instructors beat, raped and even killed the men and boys held at the facility, who ranged from 7 to 40 years of age.\n\nWhile the institution told parents it was an Islamic teaching centre that would help straighten out unruly and wayward family members, the instructors instead brutally abused them and took away any food or money sent by relatives.\n\nPolice said they had arrested the owner of the facility and two teachers, and were tracking other suspects.\n\nThe more than 200 captives who escaped were still missing, Gambo said. Police were working to reunite the others with family members.\n\n\u201cThe inmates are actually from different parts of the country - Kano, Taraba, Adamawa and Plateau States,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them are not even Nigerians. They come from Niger, Chad and even Burkina Faso and other countries.\u201d\n\nIslamic schools, called Almajiris, are common in the mostly Muslim north of Nigeria. Muslim Rights Concern, a local organisation, estimates about 10 million children attend them.\n\nWhile Buhari said the government planned to ban the schools eventually, he has not yet commented on the Katsina school.\n\nAfter the Kaduna raid, the president called on traditional authorities to work with government to expose \u201cunwanted cultural practices that amount to the abuse of children\u201d.", "description": "Hundreds of captives who were beaten, abused and held in squalid conditions at a purported Islamic school in northern Nigeria escaped prior to a raid this week, police said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Desmond", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441095112&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0Z7-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
