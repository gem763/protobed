The broader question of the evening was whether Democrats were setting themselves up for success in 2020. The answer to the first was no. The answer to the second was\u2014well, let\u2019s talk.\n\nWarren had a good outing overall, and laying off of Biden didn\u2019t hurt her. She left the sparring with Biden to Bernie Sanders, and her brand as Bernie Lite allows her to avoid a lot of specifics. In the Medicare for All debate, Warren never had to account for any differences she might have with Sanders on the issue, whereas Kamala Harris and others were made to do so. Warren remains strong on the stage and seems much less canned than she used to. She also dodges questions with more aplomb than some of her fellow candidates onstage, and dodge she did, such as when she was asked whether middle-class taxes would have to rise to pay for her health care plan.\n\nThe surprise of the evening was that Biden had a decent night. His performance in the last debate was, in the opinion of this viewer, a disaster. Not this time. In Houston, Biden managed to be combative without being nasty, and he was one of the few candidates onstage who stayed in the realm of genuine argument rather than sloganeering. (Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Andrew Yang, and Amy Klobuchar were the others.) Those hitting at Biden often looked small, such as when Juli\u00e1n Castro claimed Biden was contradicting himself on health care policy. \u201cAre you forgetting already what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro asked, in an ostensible effort to plant the idea that Biden is getting senile. The audience didn\u2019t like it. Later, when Biden argued that a certain kind of executive order on gun control would be unconstitutional, Harris said to him, \u201cHey, Joe, instead of saying, \u2018No, we can\u2019t,\u2019 let\u2019s say, \u2018Yes, we can,\u2019\u201d and let out a laugh so long and forced that it made Yellow 5 look natural.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that Biden is without serious vulnerabilities. Confronted with inconvenient, un-woke blemishes on his record of nearly five decades in politics, Biden seems to think he\u2019s best off changing the subject. Why did Biden say something in the 1970s about not owing anyone for the sins of his fathers? An expedient answer would be to say that he has learned so much in the decades since and become wiser, or something like that, but Biden ignored it and went off on a babble fest. Why did he stand by when Barack Obama was deporting so many people? In this case, too, Biden launched a babble fest\u2014an inexcusable failure of preparation, since he was asked the same exact thing in his last outing. But overall he seemed alert and presidential, and, when he was asked about resilience, his story of moving forward after losing a child (in his case, two) remained moving.\n\nBernie Sanders was hoarse, and it hurt his performance, but he continued to distinguish himself as the only economic radical onstage, despite Warren\u2019s efforts to tap into his movement. He made plain that taxes would be required to pay for his ideas. He disavowed the past two decades of trade agreements. He called the United States an oligarchy. His case is clear, and, although most of the press seems to dislike him, his brand is good. It\u2019s telling that no one on the stage save Biden was willing to challenge Sanders head-on. However, his stagnancy in the polls suggests his appeal is strong but limited.", "description": "His performance in the last debate was a disaster.
