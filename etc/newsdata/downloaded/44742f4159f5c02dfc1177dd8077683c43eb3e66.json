But at the same time, we were like, \"Finally\". It was such a long wait,' Juliane Pokini said told Maui News on Wednesday.\n\nThe certification process for the family's avocado took months, requiring them to work with a certified horticulturalist, have two witnesses fill out a bunch of paperwork, weigh the pear-shaped fruit with a certified scale, and submit pictures and video of it along with other documentation.\n\nHusband and wife Mark (right) and Juliane Pokini (not pictured) and their son, Loihi (center), applied for Guiness World Record in December after going through a lengthy certification process\n\nJuliane Pokini (right) and her husband, Mark (not pictured) applied for the Guaccolade in December\n\nIt's been more than 10 years since the family planted an avocado tree on its Wasiohuli, Hawaii homestead to commemorate the birth of their son, a labor of love that has yielded more than one enormous fruit for them.\n\nThe Pokinis first attempt to set the world record took place in the beginning of 2018 after their tree produced a 5.7 pound avocado.\n\nBut they didn't obtain the proper verification for that fruit, a learning experience that paid off during their most recent world record bid.\n\n'We just keep going. ... Imua!' Mark Pokini said with a laugh, using a Polynesian phrase that means, 'straight ahead'.\n\nThe Pokinis eventually cut up their huge avocado and turned it into guacamole, which they shared with family and friends\n\nHawaii is known for growing the world's biggest avocados. Pamela Wang of Kealakekua, Kona, Hawaii set a previous world in January 2018 with a five pound. 3.6 ounce fruit.\n\nShe was bested by Felicidad Pasalo of Hilo, Hawaii and his 5.8 pound avocado later the same year.\n\nThe Pokinis didn't let sentiment stop them from eating their record-setting produce.\n\n'We cut it open and made a whole bunch of guacamole, sharing with family and friends. It fed a lot of people. We even gave some away,' Juliane told Maui News.", "description": "The Pokini family - Mark, Juliane, and Loihi - of Kula, Hawaii received their Guinness World Record certificate for world's heaviest avocado this week after applying for the accolade in December.", "authors": ["Chauncey Alcorn For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/04/19616494-0-image-a-4_1570852650992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
