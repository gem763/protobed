These costs are so high that in many cases, companies prefer not to use the deal and just pay the higher tariffs.\n\nNew data released by the Commission on Monday shows just how bad the problem can be. EU companies trading with Switzerland, an economy highly integrated with the EU\u2019s, and which enjoys tariff-free trade under a deal but is not in a customs union with the bloc, only used that trade deal for 77 percent of their exports.\n\nThat means exporters accounting for a quarter of EU shipments in value to Switzerland preferred to pay WTO tariffs than filling out the additional paperwork to use the deal.\n\nIn contrast, 90 percent of EU exports to Turkey, which is in an (incomplete) customs union with the EU, made use of that deal to trade tariff-free.\n\nIt gets worse: Only 37 percent of EU exports to Canada, the professed model for Brexiteers, were exported under the CETA trade deal. That means that more than 60 percent of EU exports to Canada are paying higher WTO tariffs even though the companies could ship their goods at lower rates or even tariff-free.\n\nEU business lobbies such as the German Chamber of Commerce have cited excessive paperwork and \u201cbureaucracy\u201d as a reason why companies shy away from using trade deals. Firms need to prove that each of their products comply with \u201crules of origin\u201d \u2014requirements on how much Canadian or EU content has to be in each type of good to qualify for for tariff reductions \u2014 while in a customs union, tariffs are slashed by default.\n\nSmall and medium-sized companies stand to suffer the most, as they often do not have the money to pay for expensive customs brokers to help them with the paperwork, and their export volumes may not be high enough to cover the costs of the additional administrative work that comes with trading under such a deal.\n\nUnder a Canada-style deal, \u201cfirms need to get access to forms, learn or be taught about how to fill them out, and track their inputs to comply with rules of origin,\u201d said Marta Bengoa, professor of economics at Colin Powell School, City University of New York. \u201cIt is not an easy process, it requires time and is intensive in tech and human power.\u201d\n\nThis insight is from POLITICO's Brexit Files newsletter, a daily afternoon digest of the best coverage and analysis of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU available to Brexit Pro subscribers.
