No chicken sandwich. Was told to come back this day- still no sandwich. Was hustled out of money by an employee.\"\n\nHe also claimed he was attacked and sustained damage to his vehicle, but \"never came out with [a] chicken sandwich.\"\n\nY\u2019all.

In fact, Popeyes aggressively forecasted demand through the end of September and has already sold through that inventory. As a result, Popeyes restaurants across the country are expected to sell out of the Chicken Sandwich by the end of this week.\"\n\nWe hear y\u2019all.
