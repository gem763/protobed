That includes the new $3.99 (pre-tax) Popeyes fried chicken sandwich, which has blown up on Twitter as hardcore eaters voice their views on who has the best fried chicken sandwich in the fast-food game (Chick-Fil-A or Wendy\u2019s). Restaurant Brands CEO Jos\u00e9 Cil told Yahoo Finance \u2014 in not so many words \u2014 the strong consumer response on social media has translated into impressive sales of the sandwich since its August 12 release.\n\nBurger King\u2019s new plant-based Impossible Foods Whopper \u2014 priced around $6 \u2014 has been so hot the chain is having a hard time keeping it in stock, Cil suggested.\n\n\u201cIf we deliver great food, great experiences and great looking restaurants I think what happens at a macro [economic] level is less impactful at our restaurants. I have seen great businesses do poorly in up economies and smaller businesses do really well in bad economies,\u201d Cil says.\n\nAll in all, if consumers were fearful of losing their gigs \u2014 these higher priced menu items at Restaurant Brands probably wouldn\u2019t be selling that well. Instead, folks would be opting to eat at home to save money \u2014 similar to behavior seen during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Cil says he hasn\u2019t seen any cooling in sales at the company\u2019s thousands of U.S. stores.\n\nA chicken sandwich is seen at a Popeyes as guests wait in line, Thursday, Aug. 22, 2019, in Kyle, Texas.

Popeyes and Burger King saw 2.9% and 0.5%, respective increases, in U.S. same-store sales during the second quarter. Considering how competitive the fast-food industry is \u2014 and Restaurant Brands not being a major player in the key breakfast hours like rival McDonald\u2019s \u2014the sales were better than average.\n\nInvestors appreciate Cil\u2019s push into more premium products, even though Cil acknowledged on the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call this month Burger King could use a few more entry level foods (such as the new $1 taco). Restaurant Brands stock is up a cool 46% this year, about three times more than the S&P 500 (^GSPC). McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s shares have gained 21% and 35%, respectively, year-to-date.\n\n\u201cWe are confident in long-term growth with international network of master franchisees. Menu innovation at Burger King U.S. and innovation/digital enhancements at Tim Horton\u2019s Canada should support same-store sales acceleration,\u201d wrote Credit Suisse analyst Lauren Silberman in a recent note to clients.\n\nSee you at the drive-thru.\n\nYahoo Finance\u2019s Myles Udland contributed to this story.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
