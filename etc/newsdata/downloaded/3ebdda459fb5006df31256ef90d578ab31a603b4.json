But I think my attention span was a bit short for academic life, so I started writing science stories for newspapers. My first staff job was at BBC Tomorrow\u2019s World magazine, then BBC News Online. I went to New Scientist next and then the Financial Times. In 2008, I was delighted to be hired by the Guardian, which was \u2013 and is! \u2013 my favourite paper.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Damian Carrington on the Snorkel Safari in Kimmeridge, Dorset \u2013 a marine conservation zone.

What do you think the big milestones have been?\n\n\n\nWhen I joined the Guardian, concern about the climate crisis was running high, following a landmark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Al Gore\u2019s film, An Inconvenient Truth \u2013 the IPCC and Gore went on to win the Nobel peace prize. But it was seen as a future problem. The transformative moment was meant to come at the 2009 UN climate change conference in Copenhagen. But it didn\u2019t happen and after that the impacts of the global financial crisis grabbed all the attention. It wasn\u2019t until 2015, by which time the role of human activities in driving climate change was undeniable, that a big step forward was taken with the Paris deal.\n\n\n\nHow has your role in covering the environment changed in that time?\n\n\n\nThe Guardian has always taken the environment very seriously. In the decade I have been here, the team has expanded. But the basic approach has largely stayed the same \u2013 environmental issues affect everything, so should feature across all our coverage: reporting, exposing and holding to account. Today, the climate crisis is here, evident in more frequent and more severe extreme weather and climate change deniers have been relegated to the far fringes. With the global youth climate strikes inspired by Greta Thunberg and the Extinction Rebellion protests, 2019 feels like a new chapter. Those who have campaigned for decades are feeling hopeful.\n\n\n\nWhat would you say are the most important environmental issues?\n\nThe climate emergency is the best known, and it will take systemic change to beat it. But the annihilation of wildlife and the destruction of nature is just as crucial in my view \u2013 we depend on the natural world for almost everything. The huge scale of the losses \u2013 from forests to insects to marine life \u2013 has only really become widely reported in the last few years. Pollution is the third issue, particularly the toxic air that causes millions of early deaths every year. Air is actually getting cleaner in some rich nations, but the understanding of how damaging it is \u2013 on everything from intelligence to miscarriages \u2013 is only really emerging now. Chemical pollution is also a serious global problem, from fertiliser to pesticides to PCBs\n\nThe Guardian's climate pledge 2019 Read more\n\nWhat frustrates you about how these issues are sometimes be covered?\n\n\n\nOne thing is the charge of hypocrisy that is often levelled at environment campaigners because they have a TV or something. Just because you have to live in the world as it is today doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t campaign to make it a better place tomorrow. But I think hypocrisy is the attack made by people who know they\u2019ve lost the real argument.\n\nHas your work influenced/informed the way you live your life?\n\nYes. It\u2019s impossible to write about it every day and not act. I am vegan at home and whenever I can elsewhere. My home is fully insulated and my energy supplier is renewable. I rarely fly for holidays \u2013 one short haul flight in the last couple of years \u2013 and usually go to Ireland by ferry to surf. I\u2019ve also cycled to work for about 13 years now \u2013 it\u2019s cheap, fast and healthy. Being green is often worthwhile for many reasons.\n\nWhat would you say to readers who want to tackle the environmental crisis?\n\n\n\nThe big shifts will be driven by the governments we elect (in democracies) and the companies to which we give our custom. Demanding urgent action from those leaders is vital. But personal action is also important, in itself and as an encouragement to others. The biggest action, according to scientists, is having fewer children, but that of course is a deeply personal and complex choice. Flying less and eating less meat and dairy also make big cuts in your impact, as does driving fewer petrol-powered miles and insulating your home.\n\nHow can we build on the urgency we\u2019ve seen from many campaigners in 2019 and keep the spotlight fixed firmly on the big changes we need?\n\n\n\nWe are in a race against time and it\u2019s not at all certain that we are going to win. We understand the problems and what we have to do, more or less, but the pace of action is far too slow. Putting pressure on politicians and business leaders is key \u2013 giving them a strong reason to move faster. The good news is that many solutions gain their own momentum once started. In many places, solar and wind power is now the cheapest electricity, and electric cars are the cheapest to own. But there are still big problems to solve, including agriculture and aviation. The young people involved in the climate strikes will be running the world in the not-too-distant future. But we have to make sure we are still in the race by then.\n\nWhat have been the highlights of your reporting at the Guardian so far? What has made you most proud?\n\nI have written nearly 2,000 stories for the Guardian, and I\u2019d hope most of them have played a part in building awareness of environmental issues. It\u2019s usually hard to know how much impact stories have behind the scenes, but the restoration of slashed flood defence funding in England followed a lot of reporting by me, as did the EU ban on neonicotinoid pesticides, which harm bees. The recent resignation of the executive director of the UN environment programme also followed a string of my stories, which was a good example of the Guardian holding power to account. The environment team get a lot of positive feedback from readers, scientists and policymakers, which is very heartening. One prominent scientist recently told me: \u201cThank God for the Guardian!\u201d\n\nWhat is the area within your work and reporting expertise that you feel most passionately about?\n\n\n\nUsually the story I\u2019m working on right now. But in recent years I\u2019ve done a lot on pesticides, insects, the impact of livestock, microplastics and harmful subsidies. And badgers. I\u2019ve written a lot about the cull in England. One of my editors here said I had \u201cmade the Guardian the paper of choice for small mammals\u201d, which may or may not have been a compliment.\n\nWhat about the highs and lows of doing the job?\n\n\n\nOften, this is the best job in the world. I\u2019ve been fortunate to see a lot of the Earth\u2019s natural beauty. I\u2019ve tracked forest elephants in Gabon, been swimming with giant mantas in the Maldives and walked through extraordinary landscapes high in the Andes. On the other hand, almost every day I have to report more destruction and degradation of the environment. The most heartbreaking story I have covered is the poisoning of children with lead in a former mining town in Zambia. But I was glad to be able to expose it at least.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for you and the team?\n\n\n\nThe next 12 months are going to be absolutely pivotal for the world. There\u2019s a major UN biodiversity conference in China next year \u2013 the targets set a decade ago have been woefully missed. The UN climate summit in Glasgow, UK, in 2020 will also be vital \u2013 nations are going to have to make big increases in the carbon cuts they pledge if we are to get anywhere near the 1.5C temperature rise seen as a safety limit. And we\u2019ll be reporting day in, day out, across the world holding nations and companies to account for the environment and for social justice.\n\nWhat makes the Guardian unique?\n\n\n\nJohn Vidal, my brilliant predecessor as environment editor, says: \u201cEnvironment is the world and everything in it\u201d, and I think the issue now permeates all the newspaper\u2019s coverage. That is because the Guardian has always taken the issue seriously, with full support from the top and the resources to match. Our readers really care too, and they tell us. I\u2019d guess there aren\u2019t many places where all that is the case.", "description": "One of our leading environment journalists reflects on how awareness of the climate crisis has shifted in the last decade and offers advice for those who want to do more", "authors": ["Damian Carrington", "Sophie Zeldin-O'Neill"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a03050098d6c4377239f446f238df0b980cbddd9/0_32_4044_2426/master/4044.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0870705e80b883d15fce0707df3ccd0c", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
