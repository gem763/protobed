Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\nThey say that diamonds are forever, but on Sunday\u2019s \u201cShark Tank,\u201d two entrepreneurs certainly felt the pressure.\n\nAs seen recently in The New York Times, Eterneva specializes in immortalizing deceased loved ones (including pets) and letting you carry them everywhere you go. Using either a cup of their ashes or hair, along with high-pressured heat, the Austin, Texas, company turns your loved one into a forever diamond in 10 months.\n\nEterneva is the brainchild of Adelle Archer and Garrett Ozar, who pitched the sharks on Sunday's show, asking for $600,000 for a 5% stake, which values the business at $12 million.\n\n\u201cThis is about a remarkable person; someone full of hope and joy,\u201d Archer said as footage of a woman killed in a car wreck and her mother played on a screen. \u201cWe\u2019re eternalizing remarkable people, and this is how you will take them with you on the rest of life\u2019s adventures.\u201d\n\nThe new bestsellers: 'Shark Tank' exclusive: The new list of the 20 best-selling products from the show\n\nAdelle Archer and Garrett Ozar, from Austin, Texas, bring a unique solution to remembering passed loved ones by turning their ashes into diamonds. (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\nThe concept, which generated $913,000 in sales in their first year, initially wowed and shocked the sharks, and left Kevin O\u2019Leary asking the real question: \u201cIt has to be cremation, obviously, or can you take a piece of somebody out of a coffin?\u201d (The other sharks winced.)\n\nWhat didn\u2019t wow them was the discovery that Eterneva had already raised $1.2 million through a round of investors at a $10 million valuation.\n\nShaking his head, Mark Cuban said: \u201cYou come on here knowing you\u2019re going to have to negotiate, and that puts a cap on what you\u2019re able to negotiate.\u201d\n\nFellow shark Daymond John was concerned whether Eterneva really needed a shark\u2019s investment: \u201cTens of thousands of people apply to stand on this rug, and every person that takes this carpet that has the money, then they took a chance away from someone who desperately needed help.\u201d\n\nMark Cuban, Daymond John, Kevin O'Leary, Lori Greiner and Robert Herjavec field a pitch from Eterneva founders Adelle Archer and Garrett Ozar on ABC's 'Shark Tank.' (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\nArcher and Ozar stood in silence, unsure how to respond. Cuban clarified: \u201cWhat he\u2019s asking you is, are you happy with the commercial we are making for you right now?\u201d\n\nArcher disagreed, insisting they coveted a shark\u2019s investment: \u201cSeriously guys, our investors are wonderful. (But) they\u2019re tech investors. They aren\u2019t the people who can help. This is a household brand and experience, and we need partners who can help us get in front of consumers.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to negotiating, Cuban and Robert Herjavec wanted to see how serious Archer and Ozar were about an investment. \u201cI hate the fact that you have the other investors, yet you\u2019re here,\" Herjavec told them. \"If you value us, you have to pay a premium for that.\u201d\n\nYet the two entrepreneurs fielded three offers: Cuban's, for $600,000 for a 15% stake; Herjavec, who wanted 10%; and O\u2019Leary, asking for 12%. But they refused to budge from a $10 million valuation. Cuban turned down their initial counteroffer of $600,000 for 6% and said: \u201cYou\u2019re proving my point about why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nOzar tried to negotiate a combined deal between Cuban and Herjavec for $1 million for a 10% stake, but the two sharks refused, even after he offered an additional 2% in advisory shares.\n\nBoth Herjavec and O\u2019Leary retracted their deals. O\u2019Leary decided he could start his own ashes-to-diamonds business. \u201cFrankly, I could do this myself,\" he'd said earlier. \"I could buy four machines and bang out cat diamonds.\u201d\n\nWith only Cuban left to negotiate, Archer and Ozar\u2019s final offer was $600,000 for 7.5%, an $8 million valuation.\n\n\u201cIf you give me the $600,000 for 9%, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cThat might mean each of you giving up one point. One percent from each of you, the 1% advisory shares, the 6% for the $600,000, that gets you there.\u201d\n\nArcher and Ozar agreed to the deal and walked out of the tank relieved.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/14/shark-tank-recap-sharks-bite-human-ashes-diamonds-business/3946238002/", "description": "It sounds creepy, but 'Shark Tank' stars bit on Eterneva, which turns human or pet ashes into wearable diamonds", "authors": ["Matthew Wilson", "Special To Usa Today", "Published P.M.
