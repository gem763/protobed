At my healthiest I've been 15 stone, and I want to be back there.'\n\nThe TV personality, who plans to lose six stone in six months, has now focused on keeping himself active with the help of some celebrity friends.\n\n'The best thing I can do is eat healthily, and get down to the gym four times a week,' he said.

They became concerned and called the police and ambulance. They turned up and checked on me. They came up to my room to make sure I was fine.\u2019\n\nThe ambulance crew reportedly arrived to his home in South Woodford shortly before 1pm with the police arriving soon after.\n\nWhen the cops got inside, they assessed Arg but then got a second call at 4:20pm before a third ambulance arrived.\n\nEmbarrassed: James later said he was 'embarrassed' by the buss.

I\u2019m probably acting out on food.'\n\nIn August last year, Arg returned to rehab following a split from Gemma in a brave bid to tackle his demons.\n\nThe TV star spent three months in a facility in Thailand over the festive season in 2016 in a bid to curb his wild ways and revealed that he checked himself in to a programme in order to get the 'ongoing support' he needed.\n\nHe also spent time in The Priory for alleged drink and drug issues in 2014.", "description": "In an interview with OK!, he said: 'When I'm in a bad place I binge eat, and when I put on weight it triggers more issues.
