REUTERS/Ali Hashisho\n\nWith banks closed for a ninth working day, Riad Salameh also told Reuters there would be no capital controls or \u201chaircut\u201d when they do reopen, and the value of the pegged Lebanese pound would be maintained.\n\n\u201cI am not saying that we are going to have a collapse in a matter of days, I am saying we need to have a solution in a matter of days to regain confidence and avoid collapse in the future\u201d, Salameh added.\n\nSalameh spoke after giving an interview with CNN which cited him as saying Lebanon was days away from economic collapse. Salameh said the headline did not reflect what he had said.\n\nLebanon\u2019s eurobonds suffered a sell-off on the comments.\n\nThe crisis has paralysed Lebanon, closing banks, schools and some businesses. There is no sign of the government giving ground to protesters, whose demands include its resignation.\n\nProtesters set up new roadblocks early on Monday to keep pressure up, defying security forces who deployed in larger numbers and tried again to re-open roads, but under orders not to use force.\n\nThe protests, now in their 12th day, were smaller on Monday than in recent days.\n\nThe protesters accuse ruling politicians of rampant corruption and steering Lebanon towards an economic collapse not seen since the 1975-90 civil war. Lebanon is one of the most heavily indebted states in the world.\n\n\u201cSATISFY THE PEOPLE\u201d\n\nSalameh called for \u201cquick solutions that satisfy the people\u201d and create hope.\n\nLebanese banks said on Monday they would ensure public sector workers were paid their salaries.\n\n\u201cThe banks are closed by their own decision due to the situation in the country and they will reopen as soon as the situation calms down. We didn\u2019t ask them to close,\u201d Salameh said.\n\n\u201cThe opening will be coordinated with them,\u201d he told Reuters by telephone. \u201cOur objective is to protect the depositors money and the banking system and we will do the necessary for that.\u201d\n\nAsked if there would be capital controls when banks reopen, he said: \u201cNo. There is no capital control and no haircut\u201d.\n\nLebanon\u2019s banking association said banks would remain shut on Tuesday for a 10th working day, but said the central bank had provided the liquidity necessary to pay out salaries for public sector workers, including security forces.\n\nBanks have previously said they will ensure people receive their end-of-month salaries through ATMs. The banks have said they are staying closed out of concern for the safety of customers and employees.\n\nBankers and analysts have also cited wide fears depositors will try to take out their savings when banks reopen.\n\nGabriel Sterne, head of global macro research at Oxford Economics, said Lebanon is facing a \u201cbank jog\u201d, rather than a full-blown bank run. He added that capital controls were needed in the short-term, but can also scare away investors.\n\nCapital inflows needed to finance the state deficit and pay for imports have been slowing, generating financial pressures not seen in decades, including the emergence of a parallel market for dollars in recent months.\n\nWhile Lebanon\u2019s pound currency is officially pegged at 1507.5 to the dollar, parallel market rates have risen in recent months.\n\nOne market source quoted a price of 1,700 pounds to the dollar, while a second quoted 1,740, a roughly 15% premium on the official rate.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it was evaluating an emergency reform package the Lebanese government announced last week, but which has failed to defuse the popular anger or reassure foreign donors.\n\nAsked if Lebanon would have to go to the IMF or other international institutions, Salameh said: \u201cThe government has to decide what it wants to do, but I don\u2019t want to speculate.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Saad al-Hariri\u2019s coalition government last week announced a package of measures aimed at appeasing protesters and implementing long-delayed reforms to plug gaping holes in the state budget.\n\nThe measures include a $3.4 billion contribution from the central bank and commercial banks towards reducing next year\u2019s budget deficit.\n\nSlideshow (16 Images)\n\nSalameh said the sum includes the central bank reimbursing the government with interest paid on Lebanese pound debt held by the central bank, in addition to a tax on bank profits.\n\n\u201cThis is for one year because during this year they will execute the remaining items that are on the item they approved,\u201d he said.", "description": "Lebanon's central bank governor said on Monday a solution must be found in days to a crisis unleashed by huge protests against the ruling elite, saying this would restore confidence and avoid any future economic collapse.", "authors": ["Lisa Barrington", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445856089&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0QO", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
