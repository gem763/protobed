When asked how she manages to balance the copious commitments she has on her plate, the Broadway actress credits taking care of thy self.\n\nASHLEY TISDALE'S NSFW ROLE AS A SEX WORKER IN 'AMATEUR NIGHT'\n\n\u201cI mean, I love to read anything from just stuff that helps with anxiety and stuff that you would get to learn about yourself and grow,\" she said. \"I think we need to challenge ourselves as people.\u201d\n\nTisdale said she is also a \"big fan\" of meditation.\n\n\u201cThere are great meditation apps that are super easy even when I'm at work. If I have an emotional scene like I just did in the Netflix show \u2014 you know, it's like doing meditation helps you become super present in the moment and then you're able to be so connected in the scene.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cAnd I think it's such a great tool just in life.
