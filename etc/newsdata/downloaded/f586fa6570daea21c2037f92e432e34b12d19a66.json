Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he was \"not prepared at this time\" to release the videos of the raid but added some of the materials were going through a declassification process.\n\nIt was unclear if the Pentagon was considering releasing the footage from Baghdadi's final moments. The Defense Department occasionally releases videos and photographs for evidence used to justify US military action against a target.\n\nISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi being interviewed by his group's Al-Furqan media outlet in early 2019.

Soldiers from the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment, or Delta Force, reportedly conducted the raid, which resulted in Baghdadi fleeing into a tunnel and detonating his suicide vest.\n\nNo US troops were killed in the mission, according to military officials.\n\nThe ISIS leader, who is believed to have been 48 years old, took over the terrorist organization in 2010 after two of his predecessors were killed.\n\nPresident Donald Trump congratulated the US Special Forces and hailed the mission as a victory.\n\n\"Last night, the United States brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice,\" Trump said Sunday. \"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead. He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization anywhere in the world.\"\n\n\"Last night was a great night for the United States and for the world,\" Trump added. \"A brutal killer, one who has caused so much hardship and death, has violently been eliminated. He will never again harm another innocent man, woman, or child. He died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place.\"", "description": "It was unclear if the military was considering releasing video footage of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's final moments.", "authors": ["David Choi"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db7359bdee01929d675c46d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
