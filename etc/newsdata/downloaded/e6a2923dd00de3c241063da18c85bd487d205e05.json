He won't be missed.\n\nIt's a victory comparable to the military rubout of al-Qaida founder, Osama bin Laden. According to NBC News:\n\nThe world\u2019s most wanted terrorist, Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was the target of a deadly U.S.-led raid in northwestern Syria, sources told NBC News early Sunday. Forensic testing is underway, but officials believe al-Baghdadi is among the dead, the sources said. A U.S. Special Ops mission targeted the ISIS leader near Barisha, Syria, overnight. The mission included helicopters, jets and U.S. drones, the sources said. The U.S. fired from the air and then landed and gathered intelligence, the sources said. Several others were also killed in a convoy. There were no reports of U.S. casualties.\n\nSo much for all that \"expert\" opinion in the last few weeks in the mainstream media that President Trump's pullout of U.S. troops from Syria would inevitably bring the recrudescence of ISIS. Even Saturday Night Live mocked that one, and on the night of the rubout, that didn't age well from even the first minute.\n\nTrump has just shown that it's not always necessary to stage troops on foreign land to be effective.\n\nIn reality, the ISIS leadership just got decapitated, something that's going to have an impact on global terrorist operations. They just lost their big fish.\n\nIt almost makes one wonder if the terrorists themselves were fooled by the media/expert naysaying.\n\nThe terrorists, who are known to be voracious watchers of CNN and other mainstream news, decided that Trump was a wimp, a pacifist, a non-fighter for pulling U.S. troops out; Trump wouldn't fight them, they thought, leaving them with a field day. The coast was clear and it didn't take long before they popped out of their holes.\n\nBoom. That was a mistake.\n\nSuch was the suggested thinking of one military expert featured on Fox News, (hat tip: Roger Luchs, who also helpfully sent us the link), clear enough for even a baby to understand.\n\nSeems Trump had them covered all along and chose the just-right moment to lure them out of their rats nests, blowing them to hell.\n\nAnd leaving egg all over the faces of the so-called experts.\n\nWith pacifists like this, who needs warmongers?\n\nHere's a pretty good tweet to sum it all up:\n\nIsn't it weird that things always turn out so well for a president who has \"no idea what he is doing\" but the self-proclaimed \"smart people\" get everything wrong constantly? \u2014 Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii) October 27, 2019\n\nImage credit: Thierry Ehrmann, via Flickr // CC BY-SA 2.0", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2019-10/216864.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
