You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nLondon Heathrow recommends arriving three hours prior to departure for long-haul and El Al flights, and two hours prior to departure for UK and European flights.\n\nLondon Gatwick\n\nLondon Gatwick advises long-haul passengers and those on European flights to arrive around three hours prior to departure. Those flying within the UK or Ireland are advised to arrive two hours prior to departure.\n\nLondon Stansted\n\nLondon Stansted suggests checking in a minimum of two hours before the scheduled departure time of your flight.\n\nManchester Airport\n\nDue to road works around the airport and the on-going Manchester Airport Transformation Project, Manchester Airport is currently advising passengers to leave additional time for their journey to the airport, in order to have checked in and be ready to go through security at least two hours prior to departure.\n\nLondon Luton\n\nLuton Airport states that check-in desks and bag drop facilities will open two hours prior to flight time and that the airline will close the boarding gate approximately 40 minutes before the scheduled departure time.\n\nEdinburgh Airport\n\nEdinburgh Airport recommends that passengers check-in a minimum of one hour prior to scheduled departure time for UK and Ireland (including Channel Islands) flights and two hours before scheduled departure time for international flights. Those travelling on EI AI flights are required to check-in three and a half hours prior to departure.\n\nSmaller airports with fewer flyers and quicker check-in and security processes may require less time, however.\n\nLondon City Airport, for example, has just one terminal and is frequently used for business trips where passengers want to be in and out of the airport as quickly as possible. Its website boasts that passengers can be from front door to gate in 30 minutes and encourages travellers to save time by checking in online prior to their arrival or to use one of the self-service machines to check-in.\n\nChecking in online is something offered by almost all airlines; if you know you\u2019re going to be tight on time, it\u2019s also worth paying a little extra for priority boarding.\n\nAll airports advise passengers to check their airline tickets or documents for instructions regarding check-in times and to contact their airline directly if they are unsure.\n\nArrange your travel to the airport ahead of time and check closer to departure for any strikes or road works that may affect your journey.\n\nWhile waiting around in an airport terminal can be tiresome, it\u2019s worth sticking it out rather than running the risk of missing your flight. If you\u2019re late, your flight can \u2013 and will \u2013 take to the air whether you\u2019re on board or not.", "description": "The time you need to arrive at an airport depends on where you\u2019re flying from and to and who you\u2019re flying with.", "authors": ["Joanna Whitehead"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/11/16/woman-checking-in.jpg"}
