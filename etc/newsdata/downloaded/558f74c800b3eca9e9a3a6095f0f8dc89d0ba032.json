The company also reported revenue of $2.024 billion, topping estimates.\n\nBig Lots \u2013 The discount retailer beat estimates by 13 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 53 cents per share, with revenue also above estimates. Comparable store sales rose 1.2%, shy of the 1.9% consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Big Lots also said it was confident it would be able to successfully navigate tariff-related headwinds.\n\nDell Technologies \u2013 Dell reported adjusted quarterly profit of $2.15 per share, well above the consensus estimate of $1.47. The computer maker also saw revenue beat estimates on strong sales across its computer product line. Dell also said it is successfully mitigating the impact of tariffs imposed by the U.S. and China.\n\nUlta Beauty \u2013 Ulta missed estimates by 4 cents with quarterly earnings of $2.76 per share, with the cosmetics retailer's revenue essentially in line. However, comparable store sales rose less than expected, and Ulta lowered its profit forecast as sales of color cosmetics slow.\n\nMarvell Technology \u2013 Marvell beat estimates by 1 cent with adjusted quarterly earnings of 16 cents per share, with the chip maker's revenue also beating forecasts. However, Marvell gave weaker-than-expected current-quarter guidance for both revenue and profit, due to the impact of a ban on sales to China's Huawei, as well as what the company calls a difficult macroeconomic environment.\n\nWalt Disney \u2013 Disney sold its 80% stake in the YES Network to an investor group that includes the New York Yankees, Amazon.com and Sinclair Broadcast Group.", "description": "These are the stocks posting the largest moves before the bell.", "authors": ["Peter Schacknow", "Fred Imbert"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105967658-1560454840474gettyimages-1153919034r.jpg?v=1560454859"}
