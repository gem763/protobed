The party\u2019s next election manifesto is expected to contain proposals to take Royal Mail, train operators and water and energy firms back into public ownership.\n\nThe upfront cost would be the equivalent of taking every penny of income tax paid by British citizens for a whole year.\n\n\u2018The price tag for Labour\u2019s renationalisation plans is beyond eye-watering \u2013 close to \u00a3200billion,\u2019 said Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist.\n\n\u2018And that\u2019s only the starting point. It doesn\u2019t take into account the maintenance and development of the infrastructure, the trickle-down hit to pension pots and savings accounts, or the impact on the country\u2019s public finances.\n\n\u2018There are so many other genuine priorities for public spending right now, from investing in our young people to the transition to a low-carbon economy and connecting our cities and communities.\n\n\u2018These issues are what keep businesses up at night and what they want to see the Government get on with addressing.\u2019\n\nThe upfront cost would be the equivalent of taking every penny of income tax paid by British citizens for a whole year. Royal Mail vans are pictured above\n\nJeremy Corbyn confirmed in a speech last week that Labour wants to bring \u2018rail, mail, water and the energy grid into public ownership, run by and for the public, not for profit\u2019.\n\nThe party leader said vital services had been \u2018carved up and fleeced by their private owners\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018The privatisation of our utilities, which are natural monopolies, has been a failure.\n\n\u2018People are sick of paying through the nose for a poor service while billions are handed over to shareholders.\u2019\n\nBut the CBI said renationalisation could push state debt levels to 94 per cent of GDP, the highest point since the 1960s.\n\nAnd it claimed savers and pensioners could suffer a \u00a39billion hit on their holdings.\n\nThe analysis noted that the Government\u2019s assets would increase and there would be the potential for revenue from utility firms. However the study did not try to identify any benefits.\n\nLabour disputed the figures, saying it did not agree with the value the CBI had put on the companies, including a 30 per cent mark-up.\n\nA spokesman said: \u2018This is incoherent scaremongering from the CBI, which is bizarrely attacking Labour for compensating shareholders both too much and too little.\n\nThe CBI said renationalisation could push state debt levels to 94 per cent of GDP, the highest point since the 1960s. And it claimed savers and pensioners could suffer a \u00a39billion hit on their holdings\n\n\u2018It is disappointing that the CBI seems incapable of having a grown-up conversation about public ownership, which is hugely popular, and common across Europe.\u2019\n\nMr Corbyn yesterday appeared to row back on Labour\u2019s conference pledge to abolish private schools.\n\nThe Labour leader said his party\u2019s policy was simply to strip them of their charitable status, a more minor step.\n\nHe told Sophy Ridge on Sky News: \u2018Labour policy is to make sure that private education is not a charity but pays tax just like anybody else and the local education authority has far more influence over the way in which education operates.\n\n\u2018Obviously we will be deciding exactly what goes into the manifesto but the key point will be a national education service. Private schools are often seen as an elitist thing, children only go there because their parents can afford it or are prepared to make the sacrifices to try to get them there.\n\n\u2018What I\u2019d much rather is investment in the public sector schools where all children get an advantage.\u2019\n\nn Families affected by IRA attacks have demanded that Mr Corbyn apologise for \u2018giving succour\u2019 to terrorists.\n\nIn an open letter to mark the 35th anniversary of the 1984 Brighton bombing, they call on him to condemn the campaign waged by Irish republicans.\n\nMr Corbyn has so far failed to do so, saying only that he condemns \u2018all bombing\u2019. The letter was signed by 38 people who lost family members or were injured themselves.", "description": "Labour's renationalisation plans will cost at least \u00a3196billion, business leaders warn today.
