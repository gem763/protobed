Photo: Joseph Okpako/Getty Images\n\nEvery year in August, there\u2019s a week when the heat breaks and cicada calls supplant the sounds of parties and outdoor barbecues, signaling the imminent departure of the sweaty, sultry dog days. Each year, when that week arrives, I slip on the Doors\u2019 \u201cSummer\u2019s Almost Gone\u201d to try and finish the job; to send the hot season packing once again. The song is a strange outlier in the Doors catalogue, a stuffy, starched-leg blues track that floats almost entirely thanks to an army of piano and organ overdubs from keyboard player Ray Manzarek. The temptation to read too deeply into the lyric \u201cWhen summer\u2019s gone, where will we be?\u201d allures. Was Jim Morrison celebrating the coming of autumn, or lamenting the death of the Summer of Love, or predicting the end of his own life? Did he know more than he let on? Did he know nothing? The Passion of the Woodstock era, the grisly milieu of murder and war that snuffed the hope out of the \u201960s, looms large as we now end another optimistic decade in cold sweats. Maybe everything we build is meant to break. Maybe stability is a carrot dangling on a stick, driving us forward while dancing enticingly out of reach.\n\nLana Del Rey is a fascinating character, a composite sketch of ill-fated Hollywood starlets and freaked-out rock stars. She weaponizes the imagery of Americana against itself. She embodies both glamour and danger, sometimes in the same frame. Del Rey might \u201cfuck you the fuck up,\u201d or she might implore you to be kind to your fellow humans. She makes lush music about love and sadness that has, incrementally with each album, come startlingly close to matching the effortlessness of her image, graduating from the languid pop of 2012\u2019s Born to Die to the slowcore textures of Ultraviolence and the glacial trap pop of Lust for Life. With Norman Fucking Rockwell!, an hour of contemplative folk-rock tunes and lovelorn piano ballads coated in the flavors and the lore of the \u201960s, Del Rey completes the tapestry she\u2019s been sketching out since breaking through in 2011 with the ethereal, dour \u201cVideo Games.\u201d It\u2019s an achievement worthy of the constellation of classic rock gems it counts among its influences.\n\nRockwell contains a few withering rejoinders to the bad-idea crushes of \u201cVideo Games.\u201d The title track is a headshot: \u201cGoddamn manchild / You act like a kid even though you stand 6\u20192\u201d / Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all / You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you.\u201d Lana lyrics used to wince about falling for hot idiots, but \u201cNorman Fucking Rockwell\u201d absolutely destroys an unnamed partner too in love with his own smarmy, intellectual shtick to gather that it drives people away. In these new songs, Lana switches from the passenger seat she occupied in \u201cVideo Games\u201d to the role of the driver, using what she learned in years of rocky rides to steer toward a better, longer, stranger trip. This time, as \u201cLove Song\u201d coolly states it, she\u2019s the star burning through you. Rockwell is a succession of gratifying pop-album inversions that work almost purely on the depth of imagination of Del Rey and producer Jack Antonoff, the latter of whom is finally starting to make good on the pop-industry clout his work on Lorde\u2019s Melodrama brought about.\n\nWith Antonoff, Lana has created a song cycle that blends elegant melodies with instrumentation that swirls dizzyingly underneath her voice. Muted pianos and gorgeous strings evoke wind and water. The electric guitar in \u201cFuck It I Love You\u201d lumbers about dramatically, like a drunk on a dance floor. \u201cVenice Bitch\u201d is a nearly ten-minute psychedelic rock workout that\u2019s implausibly captivating all the way through, in the same way the old side-long jams like the Doors\u2019 \u201cWhen the Music\u2019s Over\u201d posit a simple idea, and then pile on juicy solos. \u201cDoin\u2019 Time\u201d is a faithful cover of the Sublime hit and the closest thing to a single the album dares. Woozy pacing makes for more than just a bummer in the summer. Lana has arrived to plunge a knife into the heaving throat of August, mourning strained relationships and failing connections just in time for hot-weather fling season to fizzle out. \u201cMariners Apartment Complex\u201d tells the story of a beau who isn\u2019t trusting enough to open up. (The inversion of the \u201cNorman Fucking Rockwell\u201d chorus of \u201cYou\u2019re just a man / It\u2019s just what you do\u201d in the \u201cMariners\u201d refrain of \u201cI\u2019m your man\u201d is absolutely delicious, and she also keeps the pronouns in \u201cDoin\u2019 Time.\u201d) Later, tumult transforms into longing on \u201cCalifornia\u201d and \u201cThe Greatest,\u201d songs that pine for a person fading into the singer\u2019s rearview.\n\nBeneath the surface messaging, Rockwell is an encyclopedia of rock-and-roll legends, and often tragic ones. Comb the lyric sheet and you catch references to Mama Cass Elliot, whose famous cover of the jazz classic \u201cDream a Little Dream of Me\u201d is flipped in \u201cFuck It I Love You\u201d; Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys in \u201cThe Greatest\u201d; and John Lennon in the \u201cWar is over if you really choose\u201d line in \u201cCalifornia.\u201d (Elsewhere, there are nods to Joni Mitchell\u2019s Ladies of the Canyon, David Bowie\u2019s \u201cLife on Mars?,\u201d Led Zeppelin\u2019s Houses of the Holy, Tommy James and the Shondells\u2019 \u201cCrimson and Clover,\u201d and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\u2019s \u201cOur House.\u201d) It\u2019s not just fan service. These are artists who went looking for America and found the dream lacking. Dennis Wilson was a great songwriter also remembered as the Beach Boy who brought Charlie Manson around; John Lennon came to the U.S. believing he could help end the Vietnam War using star power and became an unwitting enemy of the ruthless, vindictive President Nixon. The memories of their stories threaded into the knitwork of Rockwell adds historicity to the ambient feeling of doom clouding the record. They were fucked then, as we are now.\n\nBecause Lana is a merciful hostess, Norman Fucking Rockwell sends us away with a glint of hope. \u201cThe Greatest\u201d might advise that \u201cNobody warns you before the fall,\u201d but \u201cCalifornia\u201d shows you how to avoid the cliff: \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to be stronger than you really are / \u2026 You don\u2019t ever have to act cooler than you think you should / You\u2019re brighter than the brightest stars.\u201d \u201cHow to Disappear\u201d imagines a future for the singer as a writer hiding out in the quiet of the rural West Coast, like Joni\u2019s free-spirited canyon ladies from 50 years ago. Our modern monsters may change, but our dreams don\u2019t. Everybody wants to secure a place to find rest, and people to be at rest with. Norman Fucking Rockwell doesn\u2019t ever locate the storybook American life it pines for, but the quest is a thrill ride of its own.", "description": "Norman Fucking Rockwell is a succession of gratifying pop-album inversions that work almost purely on the depth of imagination of Lana Del Rey and producer Jack Antonoff.", "authors": ["Craig Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/30/30-lana-del-ray-new-album-review.w1200.h630.jpg"}
