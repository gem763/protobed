And more than a third of American workers said they believe their workplace fosters sexual misconduct, per a 2019 survey from Society for Human Resource Management.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "20% of workers in the U.S. live in a state that requires sexual harassment training.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/_P769leqalZaXrIwWoMhdBVLPIY=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/10/1570724120781.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
