Allegations of a quid pro quo were central to the complaint, later filed by the whistleblower in mid-August which also \u201cconnected the dots\u201d through media reports and other unnamed officials.\n\nThe CIA officer subsequently filed a so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint alleging President Trump committed wrongdoing by asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into accusations of corruption against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. However, both world leaders have emphatically denied any pressured was applied and the White House released a transcript of their call to show no wrongdoing occurred.\n\nThough House Democrats latched on to the complaint to launch an impeachment inquiry, several red flags have emerged regarding its author and some of his claims. According to the Department of Justice, the intelligence community inspector general who received the complaint found that it was not only based on second-hand information but that the author harbored a \u201cpolitical bias\u201d in favor of a \u201cpolitical rival\u201d of President Trump. Last week, CNN reported that the officer is a registered Democrat. Additionally, Fox News reported the officer concealed his contacts with a House Intelligence Committee staffer from the intelligence community inspector general.", "description": "The so-called \"whistleblower\" wrote that a White House official described President Trump's call with Ukraine as \"crazy\" and \"frightening.\"", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178781439-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
