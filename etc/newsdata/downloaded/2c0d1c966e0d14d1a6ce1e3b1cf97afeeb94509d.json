The crop tops. The palpable sense of sexually transmitted diseases running amok. Love Island is looking trashier than ever thanks to Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s pediatric nurse from Essex, who, wowza, just took a look at her Instagram followers. She never has to work again! More Juvederm for her! \u201cMy dad\u2019s a boxer and my mom\u2019s a pub,\u201d she helpfully tells us before her elimination. \u201cJust got my lips done. I asked the doctor for an allergic reaction.\u201d If you still want to date her, just keep in mind what she\u2019s looking for in a perfect man: He\u2019s got tattoos, really great banter, proper fit, but at the same time she\u2019ll \u2026 go with anyone.
