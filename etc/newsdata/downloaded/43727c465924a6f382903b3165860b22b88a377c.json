REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo\n\nThe Stockholm-based bank has been seeking to curb costs while still investing in digital services and improving compliance and controls to combat financial crime and money laundering.\n\nHandelsbanken said it planned to cut annual spending by about 1.5 billion crowns ($155 million) and booked restructuring charges of 900 million crowns in the third quarter, in part to cover an unspecified number of job cuts at the bank.\n\nDented by the charge, net profit fell to 3.57 billion crowns ($369 million) from 4.11 billion crowns last year.\n\nAnalysts had expected earnings of 4.11 billion crowns, according to Refinitiv data. But the estimates did not include restructuring charges.\n\nShares Handelsbanken, down marginally this year, rose 2.3% by 0709 GMT.\n\nHandelsbanken\u2019s strategy of expanding west rather than east, primarily in Britain, mean it has not become embroiled in Baltic money laundering scandals that have engulfed Nordic rivals Danske Bank (DANSKE.CO) and Swedbank (SWEDa.ST).\n\nBut the Swedish lender, which has retained a large network of independent branch offices, has faced criticism over mounting costs for modernising IT systems and its overseas expansion.\n\nChief Executive Carina Akerstrom, who took the helm this year, had said in July that an ongoing review of the bank\u2019s operations was likely to result in job cuts.\n\nThe bank said on Wednesday it would gradually wind down its relatively small business in Asia and pull out of Germany, focusing on the Nordic markets, Britain and the Netherlands.\n\nHandelsbanken will increasingly focus on areas where it already has a strong presence, such as mortgage lending and services for small- and medium-size companies.\n\nIt said it expected two thirds of cost cuts to be carried out by the end of 2020 with the final third implemented in 2022. It said the moves would shave about 500 million crowns off revenues.\n\nThe bank said it expected development spending in 2020 to remain at the 2.1 billion to 2.2 billion crown level anticipated for this year while costs to combat money laundering would remain elevated.\n\nJP Morgan said in a research note that Handelsbanken\u2019s restructuring plans were \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d but predicted cuts to average earnings estimates.\n\nThe bank\u2019s total costs, a closely watched metric, were also affected by restructuring charges. Total costs rose to 6.28 billion crowns from 5.16 billion crowns in the same period a year ago, higher than analyst forecast for 5.46 billion crowns.\n\nAll Sweden\u2019s top three banks published results on Wednesday.\n\nSEB (SEBa.ST) reported higher-than-expected third-quarter net profit amid continued robust corporate demand for its advisory services and lending business, helping its shares edge 0.8% higher.\n\n\u201cDespite a softening macroeconomic environment and a seasonal slowdown, clients remained active in the third quarter,\u201d said SEB Chief Executive Johan Torgeby said.\n\nRival Swedbank\u2019s dipped 3.6% after the bank said net earnings would fall more than expected due to costs to address money-laundering issues this year.\n\nNordea, which moved its headquarters to Finland from Sweden last year, is due to publish its earnings report on Thursday.", "description": "Handelsbanken said on Wednesday it would pull out of Asia and Germany as part of efforts to cut costs as restructuring charges weighed on the Swedish bank's third-quarter earnings.", "authors": ["Niklas Pollard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1443990621&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M09U", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
