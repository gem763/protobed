Japan and the United States rounded out the top five.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates was the most attractive Middle Eastern country, while Mauritius, in 54th place, was the highest-ranking country in Africa.\n\nA total of 140 countries were included in the ranking, which the WEF publishes every other year.\n\nThe index was compiled by measuring 90 individual indicators in each country, which fell into categories such as environmental sustainability, health and hygiene, natural and cultural resources, and international openness.\n\nHowever, in its report, published Wednesday, the WEF also warned that many countries were at a tourism \"tipping point\" \u2014 meaning surges in visitors threatened to overwhelm or damage the resources that attracted tourists in the first place.\n\nThis was particularly true for developing nations, the report said, calling for more work to be done by the tourism industry to help preserve cultural and natural assets.\n\nOne example of this was Thailand, the WEF said, where authorities were forced to close the famous Maya Bay cove after a rise in tourism caused extensive ecological damage to the area.", "description": "The World Economic Forum ranked 140 countries based on their appeal to tourists, but warned that many countries were nearing a tourism \"tipping point\" that threatened to overwhelm or damage their resources.", "authors": ["Chloe Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106111357-1567607224556gettyimages-484388792.jpeg?v=1567607284"}
