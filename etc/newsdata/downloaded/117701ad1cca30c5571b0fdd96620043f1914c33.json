The death toll is expected to rise as the clean-up operation continues.\n\nPrime minister Hubert Minnis said in a televised address on Wednesday that the government was being transparent and would \"provide timely information on the loss of life as it is available.\"\n\nDorian was packing sustained winds of 185mph (295km/h) when it made landfall at Elbow Cay on the Abacos on 1 September.\n\nIt equalled the highest winds ever recorded for a hurricane at landfall when it struck the Abaco Islands.\n\nPolice commissioner Anthony Ferguson said that the search for the victims was a slow process.\n\n\"We have to go through all of that rubble, take our time and search. It's going to take a long time before you can really say,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Rescue workers are still searching for the dead in areas such as the Abaco Islands\n\nOn Thursday the US announced $4 million (\u00a33.2 million) in new humanitarian assistance for the Bahamas.
