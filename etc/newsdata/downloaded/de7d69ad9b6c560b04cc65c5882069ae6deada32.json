Wall Street is bullish on the first phase of President Trump\u2019s trade deal with China. The stock market is near highs after rising for a decade. At a time like this, it\u2019s important to pay attention to the other side of the story.\n\nHere\u2019s the key question for technology investors: \u201cShould you buy, add, sell, trim or even short-sell specific technology stocks now?\u201d\n\nThe best tool to answer the question is to look at segmented money flows. Let\u2019s explore with the help of a chart.\n\nThe chart\n\nPlease click here for a chart showing segmented money flows in 11 popular tech stocks.\n\nNote the following:\n\n\u2022 Momentum crowd money flows are extremely positive in Apple\u2019s AAPL, -0.23% shares. This is a big turn. Momentum crowd money flows have not been consistently extremely positive in Apple for a long time. (The momentum crowd consists of individual investors chasing growth stocks.)\n\n\u2022 There is also a big turn in momentum crowd money flows in shares of Amazon AMZN, +1.78%, Netflix NFLX, -0.45% and Nvidia NVDA, +5.28% to very positive.\n\n\u2022 Of special interest is Netflix. The momentum crowd was buying Netflix near its highs. When Netflix initially fell, that crowd kept on buying it, perhaps on hopes of a rebound. Such hopes were justified to some extent because in the past Netflix had typically rebounded. When Netflix kept falling and a rebound did not occur, the momentum crowd started selling Netflix near its low. Now the momentum crowd is again buying Netflix.\n\n\u2022 Among semiconductor stocks, momentum crowd money flows are extremely positive in Advanced Micro Devices AMD, +0.62% but negative in Intel INTC, +1.96%.\n\n\u2022 Smart money flows are mildly positive in Intel and Facebook FB, +3.06%. (The smart money represents professional investors.)\n\n\u2022 Smart money flows are positive in Alphabet GOOG, +2.13% GOOGL, +2.01%.\n\n\u2022 Alibaba BABA, +2.41% has been a battleground stock. Momentum crowd money flows are positive but smart money flows are neutral.\n\n\u2022 Microsoft MSFT, +1.45% is now considered a \u201csafe\u201d stock in many portfolios. A review of analysts\u2019 reports shows the prevailing wisdom about Microsoft stock is \u201cheads you win, tails you win.\u201d Momentum crowd money flows are very positive in Microsoft. Prudent investors ought to note that smart money flows are neutral.\n\n\u2022 The momentum crowd has not lost faith in Tesla\u2019s TSLA, +0.36% stock. Momentum crowd money flows are mildly positive in Tesla.\n\nShort squeezes\n\nThe chart shows the potential for short squeezes in 11 popular tech stocks.\n\nA short squeeze occurs when short sellers either panic or are compelled to buy to cover shares that were previously short sold. This leads to a lot of artificial buying that is not based on fundamentals.\n\nOften the trigger for a short squeeze is good news.\n\nCompany rankings\n\nThe chart also shows the relative rankings of the 11 popular tech stocks. These are based on the six screens of the ZYX Change Method. Please click here to learn about the six screens.\n\nRisk-adjusted rankings are more useful for medium- and long-term positions. Non-risk-adjusted rankings are more useful for short-term or trade-around positions.\n\nHow money flows can be used\n\nPrudent investors who are serious about gaining an edge in the market from any of the following perspectives may consider using segmented money flows shown on the chart:\n\n\u2022 Risk assessment\n\n\u2022 Risk reduction\n\n\u2022 Initiating short-term positions\n\n\u2022 Exiting short-term positions\n\n\u2022 Using smart money flows for the assessment of long-term positions.\n\nDisclosure: Subscribers to The Arora Report may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time.
