New Zealand boss Steve Hansen has already made his move by naming his team earlier today (more on that shortly) with Jones set to follow suit at 9am BST. The England head coach will then speak to the media at 9:30am BST, and we'll bring you everything that the Australian has to say ahead of what is the biggest game of his reign. The team will be out in roughly half an hour, but we're expecting a few changes to the side that defeated the Wallabies last weekend in flying colours. The biggest change is set to be the return of George Ford to the starting line-up, with the fly-half restored and Owen Farrell switching to centre at the expense of Henry Slade. But there should be at least one other change in the pack in the shape of George Kruis coming in for Courtney Lawes - although the All Blacks team could trigger a late move from Jones into putting Lawes in the back row to bolster their lineout options. Eddie Jones shuffles his pack for All Blacks as George Ford starts Hansen delivered a masterclass press conference earlier today, in which he sprung a surprise by naming lock Scott Barrett at flanker while dropping Sam Cane to the bench, while responding to Eddie Jones's earlier comments in t week over spygate and pressure in style. Here's what the All Blacks coach had to say. All Blacks spring a surprise as Steve Hansen responds to 'spygate' One major player to watch this weekend will be Manu Tuilagi. The last time that the centre faced the All Blacks, he found himself out on the wing during the 2014 tour, but it is the 2012 victory at Twickenham - the last time England defeated New Zealand - that he is most famous for throughout his entire international history. Manu Tuilagi: From idolising Lomu to beating the All Blacks Advertisement The team's landed, here we go... BREAKING: England team to face New Zealand Elliot Daly; Anthony Watson, Manu Tuilagi, Owen Farrell, Jonny May; George Ford, Ben Youngs; Mako Vunipola, Jamie George, Kyle Sinckler; Maro Itoje, Courtney Lawes; Tom Curry, Sam Underhill, Billy Vunipola.

Eddie Jones makes one change to England squad to face All Blacks George Ford will start Saturday\u2019s Rugby World Cup semi-final against New Zealand alongside Owen Farrell after the pair were reunited by Eddie Jones in the England midfield. Jones makes one change to the starting line-up that defeated Australia last weekend 40-16 to reach the last four at a World Cup for the first time in 12 years, with Ford returning at fly-half and Farrell moving back to inside centre. With Manu Tuilagi shifting to outside centre, Henry Slade drops out of the starting XV. The England head coach has decided against changing his pack though, despite the threat of the All Blacks\u2019 reinforced lineout after Steve Hansen named an additional lock in the back row in the form of Scott Barrett. It means that Courtney Lawes continues in the second row with Maro Itoje, with George Kruis on the bench. There is one more change to the matchday squad as Mark Wilson makes his first appearance since the pool-stage victory over the United States, beating Lewis Ludlam to a place among the replacements.

Advertisement Here's what Eddie Jones had to say within the team announcement, although there is actually nothing to say on his selections decisions to be honest. But fear not, he'll be along in 15 minutes to give us the low-down: \u201cPreparation has been good this week after a solid win against Australia. When you get to this stage of the World Cup it is all about focusing on being in the moment and getting yourself physically right.\n\n\u201cThe squad has approached the game well with real maturity. It has helped having players here who have been on the Lions tour and played against New Zealand. They have been involved in some of the biggest games in world rugby so this semi-final won\u2019t faze them.\n\n\u201cNew Zealand are a great team, they have an impressive winning record since the last Rugby World Cup. Like any good team, you have to take away time and space from them and you have to find areas you can pressure them. We believe we have identified a number of areas where we can do that.\u201d Jones should be along any minute now, and it's a packed house for today's press conference - the busiest he'll have faced since arriving in Japan and probably of his entire England reign, come to think of it. It's was also a busy affair for Steve Hansen earlier today, but he seemed to have the room in the palm of his hands. Will Jones manage to achieve the same, or will he be in one of those moods to chuck a few more grenades at the All Blacks? Eddie Jones and Owen Farrell have arrived, and off we go. On Ford: \"Every game we have a look at the conditions, the opposition, what we think we need to do, what we have to take away from the opposition and this is the best team for us. It's horses for courses.\" \"These press conferences aren't for the details of tactics, but it's the right team this week.\" Advertisement On work-rate: \"We'll need to have exceptional work-rate this weekend, and George's work-rate is among the best in the squad.\" On Lawes ahead of Kruis: \"We've got four exceptional locks in our squad, and we thin Kruis will be better at the end of the match and Lawes can throw himself around the pitch at the start.\" On the week so far: \"I think it's been a great week, it's the greatest week of the year in rugby and we haven't done anything bad...yet.\" On playing New Zealand: \"When you play against New Zealand, the pace an intensity gets you. When we've prepared before, most of our squad have been involved against New Zealand before so they know what they need to do.\" Advertisement On Steve Hansen describing England as a caged animal: \"I think we've been eating plenty. We had some nice Miyazaki beef in Miyazaki, we've had lots of sushi here. But the boys have been waiting for this game for two and a half years, two heavyweight teams, one dressed in black, one dressed in white and it's going to be a great game.\" On how they prepare for what they don't know about the All Blacks: \"I think New Zealand have always shown a propensity for changing up their game. They always have some sort of surprise first-phase attack, you look at 2011 and they scored in the middle of the lineout. \"The one thing about playing New Zealand is you've got to be alive all the time. They're always looking for opportunities and they're always dangerous.\" On Steve Thompson claiming on TalkSport that England can't win the World Cup with George Ford at 10: \"Obviously you work for TalkSport 2, so speak to your employees at Talksport 2. I've got no opinion, but everyone's entitled to their opinion.\" On one day coming back to coach the Wallabies: \"I don't really think that's a question for now. I think we've got a game to focus on this weekend and that's all.\" Advertisement 1 2 Next\n\nWhen is the match?\n\nEngland vs New Zealand takes place in Saturday 26 October at the International Stadium Yokohama.\n\nWhen does it start?\n\nThe semi-final kicks off at 5pm Japan Standard Time, which is 8am BST.\n\nWhere can I watch it?\n\nThe match will be shown live on ITV and the ITV Hub online from 7am BST.\n\nTeams\n\nEngland (predicted): Elliot Daly; Anthony Watson, Manu Tuilagi, Owen Farrell, Jonny May; George Ford, Ben Youngs; Mako Vunipola, Jamie George, Kyle Sinckler; Maro Itoje, George Kruis; Tom Curry, Sam Underhill, Billy Vunipola.\n\nReplacements: Luke Cowan-Dickie, Joe Marler, Dan Cole, Courtney Lawes, Lewis Ludlam, Willi Heinz, Henry Slade, Jack Nowell.\n\nNew Zealand: Beauden Barrett; Sevu Reece, Jack Goodhue, Anton Lienert-Brown, George Bridge; Richie Mo'unga, Aaron Smith; Joe Moody, Codie Taylor, Nepo Laulala; Brodie Retallick, Sam Whitelock; Scott Barrett, Ardie Savea, Kieran Read.\n\nReplacements: Dane Coles, Ofa Tuungafasi, Angus Ta'avao, Patrick Tuipulotu, Sam Cane, TJ Perenara, Sonny Bill Williams, Jordie Barrett.", "description": "Follow the latest updates live from England\u2019s team announcement as Eddie Jones names his side to face New Zealand\u00a0in Saturday\u2019s Rugby World Cup quarter-final.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/24/08/eddie-jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
