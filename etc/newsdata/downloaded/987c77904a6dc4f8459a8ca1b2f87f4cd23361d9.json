Americans have been killed for their race in Charleston, for their religion in Pittsburgh, for their sexual orientation in Orlando and for their ethnicity in El Paso. They were shot by the hundreds for no apparent reason in Las Vegas.\n\nRefocusing on the new face of terrorism \u2014 the American face \u2014 is the idea behind the new counterterrorism strategy that the department released last week . \u201cIn an age of online radicalization to violent extremism and disparate threats, we must not only counter foreign enemies trying to strike us from abroad, but also those enemies, foreign and domestic, that seek to spur to violence our youth and our disaffected \u2014 encouraging them to strike in the heart of our nation,\u201d the strategy paper reads. That acknowledgment of domestic radicalization as, in part, a global phenomenon is going to be critical to applying any lessons learned from the past two decades of focusing on transnational Islamic terrorism.\n\nThe new strategy also focuses unapologetically on right-wing terrorism, particularly white supremacist extremism, a shift that is both urgently needed and long overdue. A department report written a decade ago on the rising threat of right-wing extremism was met with outrage by conservatives. After a slew of murders by right-wing extremists, however, the response to this broader strategy has been more muted.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say that the strategy itself is muted. \u201cWhite supremacist violent extremism, one type of racially and ethnically motivated violent extremism, is one of the most potent forces driving domestic terrorism,\u201d it says, noting that white supremacy has an \u201cincreasingly transnational outlook.\u201d\n\nThe strategy paper traces the white supremacist roots of \u201cconspiracy theor ies about the \u2018ethnic replacement\u2019 of whites as the majority ethnicity in various Western countries .\u201d Those conspiracy theories have recently had a wide airing, from Fox News to the president\u2019s re-election advertisements.\n\nThe strategy calls for better data collection and dissemination of intelligence to local communities and greater unity of effort in dealing with disinformation and radical content. Social media companies, for instance, made great strides in keeping radical Islamic content hard to find and share online \u2014 if only they did as much for white supremacist material.", "description": "The Department of Homeland Security is broadening its focus to include battling white supremacist attacks.", "authors": ["Alex Kingsbury"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/23/opinion/23dhs1/23dhs1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
