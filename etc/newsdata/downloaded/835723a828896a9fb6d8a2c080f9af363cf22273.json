So far, Senate Democrats have not indicated explicit support for Ozerden. But Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) suggested Wednesday that he was considering voting yes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to wait till tomorrow,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t very obvious but it\u2019s been working in both directions, some judges that were important to me got through the committee with Republican support. We try to help one another where we can in the zone of reasonableness.\u201d\n\nConfirming Trump\u2019s judicial nominees is a top priority for Senate Republicans, and the GOP has used the reshaping of the federal judiciary as a key talking point ahead of the 2020 elections.\n\nUnlike other Trump judicial nominees, Ozerden doesn\u2019t have the backing of conservative groups like the Judicial Crisis Network. Republicans and conservatives have questioned Ozerden\u2019s judicial philosophies as well as a 2012 opinion he authored while serving as a federal judge in Mississippi that deemed a lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate premature.\n\nHawley, who announced in September that he would vote against Ozerden, said in an interview that that Ozerden\u2019s Obamacare decision highlighted the Mississippi judge\u2019s \u201ctroubling\u201d views on religious liberty.\n\n\u201cI just think his religious liberty record is one that is difficult, that is troubling, there\u2019s no issue that\u2019s more complicated frankly,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cThose are very complex issues, they\u2019re also really on the front line, which you\u2019re going to have to deal with this for the next two, three decades.\u201d\n\nBut Ozerden has the backing of his home state Mississippi senators Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith, and strong support from Mulvaney, who was a groomsman at his wedding. Other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, including Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Joni Ernst of Iowa, said that they were undecided. Ernst met with Ozerden Wednesday.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said the White House is still pushing for Ozerden\u2019s confirmation and appeared optimistic Wednesday that the committee would approve him.\n\n\u201cI feel good about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have the president talk to some folks, I think he\u2019s a good nominee, in my view exactly what I\u2019d be looking for from a Trump pick.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if Democrats would support Ozerden\u2019s nomination, Graham responded that Ozerden deserved bipartisan support. But he added, \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens tomorrow.\u201d\n\nOzerden was slated for a committee vote in September, before the Senate left for a two-week recess. But the Judiciary Committee shelved the vote, shortly before it was scheduled after Hawley said that he would vote against Ozerden.\n\nThe Mississippi judge was controversial even before he was formally nominated. Mulvaney reportedly pushed for his nomination over objections from the White House Counsel\u2019s office last year and the Judicial Crisis Network\u2019s Chief Counsel Carrie Severino said the administration \"could do better.\"\n\nAnd in an unusual move prior to his confirmation hearing, Republican senators were given individual briefings from judiciary staff about his FBI background investigation. Some Republican staffers have questioned why the Senate Judiciary Committee was even holding a vote on the nominee, given the controversy and uncertainty around his nomination.\n\nDemocrats are not rushing to support the Mississippi judge. Senate Judiciary Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she planned to vote against him, as did Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii.). Sen. Chris Coons (D-Dela.) is undecided.\n\nIn explaining her opposition to Ozerden, Hirono cited that he \u201ctried to show that he is conservative enough for the likes of Ted Cruz.\u201d When asked about Democrats potentially helping Ozerden advance out of committee, Hirono responded: \u201cI won\u2019t be among them so I have nothing to say about that.\u201d\n\nOzerden has the backing of some Senate Republicans on the committee. Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) plan to support his nomination, as does Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas.). But Cornyn questioned whether the Judiciary Committee would even have a vote Thursday morning and said \u201cthere\u2019s a possibility\u201d the White House will pull the nomination.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be close,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cIf it comes up for a vote.\u201d\n\nBurgess Everett contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d3/a7/ee5312f34a57a79f9bd3d227ed00/20191016-donald-trump-pick-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
