You can try to play it cool and downbeat and repeat the usual mantras \u2014 it\u2019s just another game, it\u2019s not even the final \u2014 but we all know it\u2019s more than that.\n\nThe whole nation will come to a halt on Saturday to watch this one and rightly so. This is probably the biggest match and biggest rugby occasion in the modern history of the English game \u2014 and that includes our World Cup triumph in 2003.\n\nEven now, five days out, I can feel the excitement and anticipation.\n\nEngland's semi final on Saturday is arguably the biggest rugby occasion in our modern history\n\nEngland against the All Blacks is the classic confrontation. Every rugby fan around the world wants to see it \u2014 indeed, every sports fan is up for this. What\u2019s more, both sides are bang in form.\n\nAnd on top of that is the novelty value of this fixture. We haven\u2019t seen it at the World Cup in 20 years and indeed the sides have only met once in the last five years in any sort of game. That was at Twickenham last November when England started brilliantly but blew a 15-0 lead to lose 16-15.\n\nI love the scarcity value surrounding this confrontation, it reminds a me a little of when I was a young player and you got to see England play New Zealand about once every five years \u2014 basically when they toured over here. It was always so special.\n\nThe massive difference now, of course, is that although they have met only once during Eddie Jones\u2019 tenure, both side know almost everything there is to know about each other. The level of analysis is such that there will be very few surprises from either side on Saturday.\n\nEngland are the side New Zealand would have least wanted to meet in the semi-finals\n\nOne thing England will know for sure is that New Zealand and Steve Hansen will not make life as easy for them as Australia did on Saturday. And that is not to detract from a cracking England performance. I listened to Michael Cheika\u2019s post-match interview and in one way I sympathised with him. I have sat in that chair after losing a World Cup quarter-final and it\u2019s a horrible place, it feels like your entire life has just caved in. And, indeed, Sunday came the news that he is to stand down as Australia coach.\n\nBut I still couldn\u2019t believe his defence of his team\u2019s side\u2019s woeful exit strategy, lack of a kicking game and the number of interceptions and turnovers they seemed to cough up in every game. \u2018We are here to play footie,\u2019 was his reply. No, Australia were there to win a World Cup quarter-final by clever, precise, passionate rugby. Whatever it takes to win a particular game.\n\nThere will be no gifts from New Zealand. England will have to earn and manufacture every single point they score on Saturday. That\u2019s going to be extremely tough but the good news is that this England team is getting better with every match and has enormous strike power.\n\nThe whole nation will come to a halt on Saturday to watch this clash and rightly so\n\nNew Zealand are always confident, it\u2019s part of their rugby DNA, but let\u2019s be clear here: England are the side they would have least wanted to meet in the semi-finals. They know England have the power to hurt them. They won\u2019t be steamrollered up front as a disappointing Ireland were and England can hurt any side with ball in hand.\n\nThey also have the world\u2019s most reliable big-match goal kicker in Owen Farrell who, after a rare blip against Argentina, was eight from eight on Saturday. Normal service resumed.\n\nI\u2019m not expecting many changes in the England starting line-up. I would consider just the one and that is George Kruis to start, with Courtney Lawes reverting to the bench.\n\nThe New Zealand lineout is superb and Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock are a fantastic combination at lock \u2014 the best in the world.\n\nSo England need to counter those two and the best lineout combination they have is Maro Itoje and Kruis.\n\nGeorge Kruis could start for England with Courtney Lawes reverting to the bench instead\n\nBoth are secure on their own ball and arch-poachers of opposition ball. If they could nick three or four New Zealand throws, or even badly disrupt them, that could be the difference in a very tight match.\n\nLawes is the more destructive tackler in the open but Kruis is very physical in the close quarters and again this is where England might cause some damage. I\u2019m not saying New Zealand aren\u2019t incredibly physical as well but this game will be a different level.\n\nThere are going to be huge confrontations all over the field \u2014 those mighty locks, the front rows, Ben Youngs and the excellent Aaron Smith at nine, Owen Farrell and Richie Mo\u2019unga at 10, the flying wings, Beauden Barrett and Elliot Daly at full back.\n\nThere is so much to savour here and we have got all week to enjoy it!", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: There is no avoiding the superlatives and hype over Saturday's World Cup semi-final against New Zealand.", "authors": ["Sir Clive Woodward For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/21/19965366-0-image-a-71_1571604152213.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
