O\u2019Rourke made his comments during a town hall Q&A held at the College of Charleston in South Carolina.\n\nThe first question that evening came from a 29-year-old man who was curious about the former Texas representative\u2019s abortion stance.\n\n\u201cSomeone asked you specifically about third-trimester abortions, and you said that\u2019s a decision left up to the mother,\u201d he said, remembering O\u2019Rourke\u2019s past comments during a Cleveland event in March. He wanted to know if O\u2019Rourke still agreed with that.\n\n\u201cI was born September 8, 1989, and I want to know if you think on September 7, 1989, my life had no value,\u201d he told O\u2019Rourke.\n\nThe Democrat politician responded, \u201cOf course I don\u2019t think that. And of course I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re here.\u201d But, he added, his answer on abortion \u201cremains the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a decision that neither you, nor I, nor the United States government should be making. That\u2019s a decision for the woman to make,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said to the crowd\u2019s delight. \u201cWe want her to have the best possible access to care and to a medical provider.\u201d\n\nAfter warning his audience about threats to abortion and Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that legalized abortion in the U.S., O\u2019Rourke concluded that \u201cI don\u2019t question the decisions that a woman makes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly she knows what she knows, and I want to trust her with that,\u201d he added.\n\nBut the pro-life movement doesn\u2019t challenge abortion because it distrusts women. It challenges abortion to protect women \u2013 and all human life \u2013 from the moment of conception.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments mirror many in the media who attack any restrictions or limits on abortion. But abortion, and how it works, is difficult to defend when looked at in detail.\n\nIn 2016, Dr. Anthony Levatino, an obstetrician-gynecologist who has performed more than 1,200 abortions, examined the different procedures with pro-life group Live Action.\n\nDuring a third trimester induced abortion, which is \u201cperformed 25 weeks to term,\u201d the unborn baby is \u201calmost fully developed and viable\u201d or \u201ccould survive outside the womb if the mother were to go into labor prematurely,\u201d he said. He\u2019s right \u2013 as The New York Times reported in 2015, studies show that babies can survive at 22 weeks.\n\nAn abortionist \u201cuses a large needle to inject a drug called digoxin\u201d that \u201cwill cause fatal cardiac arrest,\u201d Levatino said. The needle travels \u201cthrough the woman\u2019s abdomen or through her vagina and into the baby, targeting either the head, torso, or heart.\u201d The baby\u2019s life ends.\n\nNext, the abortionist \u201cinserts multiple sticks of seaweed called laminaria into the woman\u2019s cervix\u201d which will \u201cslowly open up the cervix for delivery of a stillborn baby.\u201d A couple days later, the abortionist \u201creplaces the laminaria and may perform a second ultrasound to ensure the baby is dead.\u201d\n\nThe mother \u201cmay be advised to deliver her baby into a bathroom toilet,\u201d he said. But \u201cif she can make it to the clinic, she will do so during her severest contractions.\u201d He concluded, \u201cif the baby does not come out whole,\u201d then the abortionist \u201cuses clamps and forceps to dismember the baby piece by piece.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because unborn babies \u2013 especially the day before birth \u2013 have pieces.\n\nBy the time a woman finds out she\u2019s pregnant, her unborn baby likely already has a heartbeat, which media admit begins around six weeks of pregnancy. In the second trimester, according to MayoClinic.org, unborn babies boast fingerprints and can suck their thumbs. In the third trimester, they can detect light and even practice breathing.\n\nAbortions performed past 21 weeks are rare, but they still happen, according to the Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI), the research arm of the Susan B. Anthony List. On top of that, CLI has found that the United States is one of only seven countries with elective abortions past 20 weeks.\n\nIronically, the abortion procedure itself, particularly later in pregnancy, reveals the humanity of the unborn. The abortionist has to make sure that each part comes out \u2013 that a heart stops beating. That\u2019s because, the unborn, in the end, are so much more than just a \u201cchoice.\u201d", "description": "Beto O\u2019Rourke recently argued that, while unborn life has value, .09/02/2019 3:14:29AM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Yoder", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/44/77c5f8f1-e992-40fd-894a-968f8ea4efac.png"}
