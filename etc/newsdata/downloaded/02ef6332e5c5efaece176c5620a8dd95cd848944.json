DC is owned by Warner Bros., which was recently swallowed up by AT&T. Movie adaptations have been an important part of how DC does business at least since Christopher Reeve\u2019s first flight as Superman in 1978. However, over the last decade and change, Marvel (bought by Disney in 2009) has shown up DC with its Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. One movie built on the next for a string of about 20 box office wallet busters.\n\nThe MCU was so successful that DC attempted to do something similar, a DC Extended Universe. Then the live action Justice League movie opened. It was a commercial and critical flop that was made worse by its late-in-the-game development hell. Director Zack Snyder left the movie, citing the suicide of his daughter Autumn, and Avengers director Joss Whedon was brought in to do an expensive salvage job. Yet Whedon was hamstrung by all kinds of things, including a mustachioed Superman who wasn\u2019t allowed to shave.\n\nAfter the Justice League debacle, word went out from Warner Bros. that the DCEU wasn\u2019t a concern anymore. They would just go back to making regular old movies. That decision made director Todd Phillips\u2019 Joker possible, and it\u2019s making AT&T a lot of money. The $96 million opening weekend at the domestic box office was \u201cthe largest October domestic opening weekend of all-time and the fourth largest opening ever for an R-rated feature,\u201d reports BoxOfficeMojo.com. Joker beat Justice League\u2019s opening weekend haul and set a new bar for Tuesday box office in October, the night I saw it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoker is a period film (set in the 1970s or early \u201880s) starring the character actor Joaquin Phoenix. \u201cPhoenix is a fucking beast,\u201d effused Spanish comic book artist Ibai Canales about the actor\u2019s turn in Joker, and he\u2019s not wrong. There are long stretches without dialogue, where we see Phoenix walking, riding public transportation, or just sitting at home alone. It sounds boring, but the actor\u2019s ridiculously large presence had viewers (including this one) glued to the screen.\n\nThe story: Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a man pushing middle age who lives with his aged mother in Gotham City\u2019s projects. He scratches up money as a clown-for-hire, dancing and waving a sign to get folks into your business or dancing for the kids at the children\u2019s hospital. In his spare time, he writes out jokes in a notebook and tries them out in stand-up sets at a comedy club. And he\u2019s usually the only person laughing.\n\nIn fact, Arthur bombs at all the normal things he tries. Part of his failure is dumb luck, part stems from a truly horrific childhood, and part comes from his volatile constitution. Arthur is on seven different medications. He laughs uncontrollably in response to stresses, which Phoenix turns into moments that elicit deep pity from the audience. We all understand what it\u2019s like when our bodies decide to take us for a ride.\n\nArthur discovers his true self in violence. Three well-to-do thugs viciously beat him on a Gotham subway train, but this time a colleague has given him Chekhov\u2019s gun. In a scene that has echoes of the Bernie Goetz case, Arthur shoots them all down, first for self-defense and then for sport. Because he is in full clown regalia, he accidentally prompts a painted protest movement against Gotham\u2019s rich and powerful. Think Juggalos meet Antifa.\n\nExcept that Antifa is out of place here. This is very much a throwback movie, recycling themes that were popular in 1970s cinema: alienation, near total skepticism of authorities, public neglect, and, of course, nihilism. Just in case we missed that last part, Arthur helpfully reminds a live studio audience, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in anything,\u201d before putting a bullet into his former hero\u2019s head.\n\nMost criticisms of Joker misfire badly, and show just how dumb current day, intersectional obsessions with victimology have made us. The movie is \u201cproblematic,\u201d claimed many brain-dead critics, principally because Arthur is a white male who metes out violence. Except: most of his victims are white males, and privileged ones to boot. He is said to be racist, even though his interactions with African Americans simply do not bear that out. And even if they did, so what? This is the story of the rise of a great villain. Arthur becomes Joker, the \u201cclown prince of crime.\u201d He can\u2019t be guilty of thoughtcrimes too?\n\nThe movie is said to be a rallying cry for Trumpian \u201cincels,\u201d which seems a huge stretch. The audience I saw it with skewed young but was quite mixed, at least set against the local population of Bellingham, Washington. Many women watched and didn\u2019t seem put off. There were no obvious huffy walkouts. It seems the film\u2019s real sin is that director Phillips doesn\u2019t care for most modern political obsessions, right or left, and is vocal about it. He didn\u2019t want our temporary concerns to drag this timeless story down. This may make the Oscar gods angry, but future cinephiles should be glad that he resisted.\n\nFinally, for the diehard comic book fan, Joker offers, withdraws, and offers again the best possible explanation for why Batman doesn\u2019t ever kill his nemesis. Arthur briefly comes to believe that he is the bastard son of Thomas Wayne, father of a young Bruce Wayne. Thomas denies this and punches Arthur in the nose for the suggestion (and for meeting his legitimate son). What records exist are seemingly on the elder Wayne\u2019s side. But again, this is a very \u201870s movie and authorities are not to be trusted. We see a note on a photo of his mother that reopens the question.\n\nOne serious ethical dilemma many critics have faulted Batman for not facing head on is: why do you keep returning the Joker to Arkham Asylum if you know from experience that he is going to escape again to terrorize and kill more people? The inference isn\u2019t necessarily that Batman must kill Joker, yet he has saved Joker from death many times. Why do that, if saving him will doom innocent people? The comics don\u2019t offer a good answer, but this movie suggests one. What if Batman tolerates Joker because he suspects he really is his older half-brother who was badly done by their father? After all, familial guilt makes people do all kinds of crazy things\u2014in real life and in the funny books.\n\nJeremy Lott is creator of the comic book Movie Men.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-23-at-11.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
