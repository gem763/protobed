The offering makes Peloton the latest startup valued over $1 billion to tap the public markets.\n\nPeloton, an indoor exercise equipment company offering digital workout subscriptions, is set to have class A shares begin trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker \u201cPTON\u201d during market hours Thursday. The company also has class B common shares, which offer 20 votes apiece, held by executives and early investors.\n\nThe reported pricing lies at the high end of the expected $26 to $29 per share range the company had been targeting. Peloton did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance\u2019s request for comment.\n\nPeloton has raised $994 million in venture capital funding, and was last valued in private markets at $4.15 billion in August 2018, according to Pitchbook. That makes it a \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 putting it in the same company as Uber and Lyft when they first went public. Just like those companies, Peloton has yet to turn a profit.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) and J.P.Morgan Securities (JPM) are serving as lead underwriters for the IPO.\n\nPublic prospects\n\nFounded in 2012, the New York-based company has since amassed more than 511,000 \u201cconnected fitness subscribers\u201d tuning in for Peloton\u2019s streamed workout classes.\n\nPeloton\u2019s exercise equipment sells for around $2,000 for its flagship stationary bicycle, and $4,000 for its newer treadmill \u2014 with subscribers then shelling out an additional $39 per month for classes. During fiscal year 2019, the company cited a customer acquisition cost of just $5 per connected fitness subscriber.\n\nBut while the equipment comes at a premium price tag for consumers, those sales haven\u2019t yet translated into profits for Peloton.\n\nPeloton priced its IPO Wednesday evening. Shares are set to begin trading Thursday on the Nasdaq under the ticker \"PTON.\" More\n\nThe company has run at a loss since inception, and posted a net loss of $195.6 million for the year ending in June, more than quadrupling that of the year prior.\n\nBut top-line growth has also been robust, with revenue more than doubling to $915 million during the period.\n\nPeloton\u2019s margins have also been pressured, with some analysts suggesting there\u2019s more of that in store as the company launches more live-studio content, and ramps up its apparel business.\n\nThe red ink puts Peloton in the company of other highly valued tech companies that hit the public markets this year, including Uber (UBER), Lyft (LYFT) and Slack (WORK).\n\nThese companies have so far seen their stock prices punished by investors demanding clearer near-term paths to profitability: Uber and Lyft shares each trade below their IPO pricing. And at around $22 apiece, Slack\u2019s shares trade well below their opening trade price of $38.50 from the company\u2019s April direct listing.\n\nThe timing of Peloton\u2019s IPO also comes just following a debacle for WeWork\u2019s parent company as it sought its own public listing, with the office-leasing company\u2019s high-flying private market valuation coming under scrutiny ahead of its listing. The company has since at least temporarily shelved the offering and replaced its CEO Adam Neumann with two newly elevated executives.\n\nBut external factors aside, other questions have also arisen around Peloton\u2019s public prospects. The company said in its S-1 it believes its total addressable market is 67 million households, including 45 million in the U.S. \u2014 a figure that some analysts have called overly ambitious given the high price point for the products and services.\n\nThe company is also grappling with ongoing legal battles over music licensing in its workout videos.\n\nMark your calendars!
