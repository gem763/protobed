The refinery is the fourth largest in Texas, and is currently undergoing a major expansion that will make it one of the two largest refineries in the country. \u201cExxon Mobil\u2019s Beaumont refinery and chemical complex is conducting a preliminary assessment to determine the impact of the storm,\u201d an company spokesman told the Chronicle. \u201cThe Beaumont chemical plant has completed a safe and systematic shutdown of its units.\u201d\n\nOfficials are telling residents to shelter in place and get to high ground if possible. All service roads in the city have become impassable, leaving two local hospitals inaccessible, according to authorities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad. Homes that did not flood in Harvey are flooding now,\u201d said Jefferson County Judge Jeff Branick.\n\nBeaumont police spokesperson Carol Riley said authorities are in \u201cstrict life-saving mode right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet the public know more than anything stay off the roads. Shelter in place,\u201d Riley told the Beaumont Enterprise. \u201cPeople are panicking because they have ankle deep water in some places or their cars are stalling.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, Imelda is moving slowly across the region and an additional six to 12 inches of rain\u2014on top of the 30 inches so far reported in parts of Texas\u2014could fall through Thursday night.\n\nThe Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office has issued a warning that a levy holding back 4,600 to 5,600 acres of water from flooding 219 area homes, Interstate Highway 10, and thousands of agricultural acres has deteriorated to the point that it \u201ccould break any moment.\u201d\n\nResidents of Gilbert Lake Estates near the Green Pond Gulley Levy have been ordered to evacuate immediately.\n\n\u201cRescue Boats are sparce (sic) at the moment however, we do have several en route to that area,\u201d reads a warning posted to the sheriff\u2019s office\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cIf you live in the area and have a boat, please pick up your neighbors and go to Hwy 365 overpass at I-10.\u201d\n\nThe levy was also breached during Hurricane Harvey. A multi-million dollar Hurricane Harvey restoration project approved in 2018 has worked to stabilize the basin. The USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service of Texas reported in August 2018 that a \u201c26-foot deep washout in the bottom of the levee\u201d was repaired and that the remaining work of stabilizing the embankments eroded away by flooding would be completed by the drainage district.\n\n\u201cThe levee was built for a 500-year flood, but some estimate this was a 1,000 plus year flood,\u201d said Richard LeBlanc, Jr., general manager of the Jefferson County Drainage District, after Harvey\u2019s flooding. \u201c... We have spent a lot of time and money to protect our area. We repair the damage and hope we never have this type of historic rain again.\u201d", "description": "Another foot of rain\u2014on top of the 30 inches already reported in parts of Texas\u2014could fall through Friday. \u201cHomes that did not flood in Harvey are flooding now,\u201d an official said.", "authors": ["Audrey Mcnamara"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_130/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568927193/GettyImages-1169596919_pd0wbo", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
