Though the video itself is fairly nondescript, the statement sheds further light on the purpose of the flight: the 30-minute exercise was intended to \u201cbroaden the [Su-57] fighter\u2019s radar coverage and to provide target acquisition for employing air-launched weapons.\u201d\n\nA defense industry source has told TASS state news that this is the first of several, increasingly complex exercises meant to test and refine Okhotnik\u2019s ability to execute tasks in a \u201cpartially autonomous mode.\u201d Sukhoi engineers are also reportedly evaluating the feasibility of fully autonomous flight routines from takeoff to landing.\n\nFormally unveiled at the ARMY-2019 exhibition held outside Moscow earlier this summer, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov told Russian state news that the first, serially-produced S-70 units will enter service in 2025. The Okhotnik drone is being designed with a substantial stealth component, featuring composite surfaces coated with radar-absorbent materials. At the same time, it boasts a jet fighter-grade AL-31F or AL-41F engine that supports a maximum speed of up to 1,000 km/h.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "This can't be a good thing.", "authors": ["Mark Episkopos"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/paxiXuPHR608xP8piQP6mw--~B/aD04MTA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/1f0d6c7dcb0cc2fd02342ba4c3270411", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
