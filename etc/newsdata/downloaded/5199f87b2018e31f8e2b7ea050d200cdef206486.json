By many measures, the Tunisian economy is now in an even worse state, contributing to regular protests and a widespread sense of alienation from politics, according to public surveys.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People attend a commemoration ceremony for the late Tunisian president, Beji Caid Essebsi, in Tunis.

Many are now seeking to return. Tunis, the capital, was rocked by two suicide bombings in June that were claimed by the Islamic State group.\n\nYet Tunisia\u2019s transition to democracy has proved more resilient than some expected. The largely peaceful run-up to the polls has raised hopes the country will achieve its first handover of the presidency from one elected leader to another, considered a key hurdle in the development of young democracies.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Candidates at a TV debate for Tunisian presidential candidates on 7 September.

He has denied all the charges.\n\nHe is still running as part of a crowded field of 26 candidates including Abdelfattah Mourou, a lawyer and the first Ennahda member to run for president since the revolution, and Abir Moussi, a supporter of Ben Ali trading on nostalgia for the former president\u2019s harsh rule, which is growing in some quarters.\n\n\u201cThe political class are happy there is democracy, elections and freedom of expression,\u201d Amri said. \u201cBut for other people, they don\u2019t care about these things if they have difficulties in their lives.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Abdelfattah Mourou, the Islamist-inspired Ennahda party candidate.

After a close legislative election in 2014, Essebsi and his political rival, the Ennahda president Rached Ghannouchi, struck an improbable agreement to share power, widening the tent to include smaller parties in 2016.\n\n\u201cThese men were older, more experienced, and were both extremely committed to democracy, they saw the importance of it for Tunisia and decided it was best for the country to work together.\u201d\n\nOpinion is divided on the wisdom of the power-sharing truce, which has calmed the country\u2019s politics but stalled progress on difficult but urgent reforms that might split the unity government.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tunisia\u2019s prime minister, Youssef Chahed, campaigns as a presidential candidate.

We\u2019re close to nine years since the revolution and people\u2019s patience is running out.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s polls, and legislative elections scheduled for October, will indicate whether the country\u2019s next generation of political elites will be as willing to accommodate each other, and if so, whether they can effectively govern a population frustrated by the lack of progress towards \u201cwork, freedom and national dignity\u201d \u2013 demands Tunisians chanted on the streets nearly nine years ago.", "description": "Arab spring\u2019s sole democratic state has proved resilient despite anger over price rises", "authors": ["Michael Safi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df66110c4d50f46fb1deea49246865ba435fb8bf/0_144_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5a3e8c68002f7eeb4d1634ef148b3dd1", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
