Five days a week, the DeKalb County native transports seeds and other agricultural products, his workdays sometimes nearing 12 hours on the road.\n\nDespite receiving his first payment from the United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Market Facilitation Program (MFP), Tuttle told ABC News that many farmers within his community depend on side businesses to earn additional income.\n\nMFP was announced on May 23 by Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue as a response to the ongoing trade war between China and the United States. President Donald Trump authorized $16 billion of aid to assist American farmers who might have faced any losses and damages caused by imposing tariffs.\n\nIn May, Trump said the aid package would enable farmers to do well and \u201cmake the same kind of money.\u201d\n\n\"Farmers have been great. We are helping them with assistance as much as we can,\" Larry Kudlow, Director of the United States National Economic Council, said in August. \"We'll help them more if need be.\"\n\nYet full assistance from MFP and other government programs remains to be seen, and for farmers like Tuttle, maintaining previous income levels has been a major challenge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m driving trucks to Nebraska because farming isn\u2019t paying me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a struggle to make ends meet, and MFP is just a small band-aid on an open wound.\u201d\n\nTuttle considers himself lucky, after seeing another farmer 30 miles away, sell his machinery and shut down his farm.\n\nJulie Pace/AP, FILE\n\nSoybean and corn farmers have taken a particularly forceful hit as a result of the trade war. Both the 2018 and 2019 tariffs impacted corn, soybean, wheat and dairy producers because of limited markets, and subsequently, a drop in the selling price of soybeans.\n\nChinese officials are scheduled to hold trade talks in Washington with the U.S. this coming week.\n\n\"China's coming in next week,\" Trump told reporters at the White House Thursday. \"We're going to have a meeting with them. We'll see. But we're doing very well.\"\n\nTom Corcoran of the New York Corn & Soybean Growers Association said tariffs caused the market to drop significantly. Whereas in 2018 he sold his soybeans at $9.50 to $10 a bushel, Corcoran now struggles to sell them at above $8.50.\n\nAs a result, he says trucking constitutes one-third of his income and is necessary to help replace the money being lost from the tariffs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always a bit overwhelmed because there\u2019s too much on my plate,\u201d Corcoran told ABC News. \u201cI\u2019m at risk of lawsuits from potential road accidents, and it gets tiring.\u201d\n\nLike Tuttle, the New York farmer signed up for MFP, which he says does not pay very much, roughly less than $40 an acre depending on the county.\n\n\u201cOne of the first thoughts in my head, when I wake up in the morning, is how am I going to pay my bills? I\u2019m fortunate to have my sideline. If I lose a little, it\u2019s not good, but it\u2019s not detrimental,\" Corcoran said. \"But for people who have more acres, they don\u2019t have time.\u201d\n\nFor some farmers, their frustration does not stop at MFP. Seth Pritchard, a member of the New York Corn & Soybean Growers Association and Trump supporter, says that within his community, patience among farmers is wearing thin for the Trump administration. Though many identify as Republican, Pritchard says the longer the trade war drags on, the harder it is for the group to remain supportive of the president.\n\nEdwin Remsberg/VWPics via AP Images, FILE\n\nSimilarly to other farmers, Pritchard is signed up for MFP and maintains his income by caring for other community residents\u2019 horses, a task he says he would not be doing if the effects of the tariffs were not so detrimental.\n\nHe does not see MFP as a solution; instead, he believes farmers shouldn\u2019t be placed in a position where they must apply for payments to support their income.\n\nSouth Dakota farmer, Nick Nemec echoes this sentiment, believing farmers in his community need open trade, not \u201cgovernment welfare checks\u201d that do not come close to covering market losses.\n\n\u201cPayments are simply an attempt to buy off farmers and to make up for the trade war damage, but it hasn\u2019t made up for the damages at all,\" he told ABC News. \"We still have to make up for lost income elsewhere.\"\n\nABC News' Ben Gittleson contributed to this report.", "description": "Farmers across the country rely on the Market Facilitation Program for financial aid, but many say that it isn't enough to pay the bills.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/farmer-truck-ap-jt-191004_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
