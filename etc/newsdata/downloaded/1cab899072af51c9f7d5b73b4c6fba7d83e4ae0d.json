The journey is a popular one with Australian sailors and takes five days of round-the-clock sailing in good weather, longer with stops and day sailing.\n\nThe P&O cruise ship Pacific Dawn picked up their emergency beacon and collected the men several hours later near the coast of New Caledonia, without even having to alter its route.\n\n7NEWS Australia (@7NewsAustralia) Two Australians and a British man have been rescued by a P&O cruise ship near New Caledonia. https://t.co/mFtCr4ThRN #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/VH26zdUNdG\n\n\u201cInitially we thought we might have hit a reef but that wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d Chris Doran told reporters in Brisbane after the cruise ship docked on Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cWe found quite a large ship\u2019s rope, there was about 50 metres of it and it wrapped around both propellers causing a breach in the hull, the boat started taking on water.\u201d\n\nRealising their boat was going under, the men made a May Day call, grabbed their passports and some water before piling into a life raft.\n\nDoran told reporters he had sailed the Liberty for six years and was sorry to lose it, but knew it could not be saved.\n\nMore pressing was the risk the lifeboat would be overturned in rough seas, or float dangerously toward the reef, which was just six nautical miles \u2014 11km \u2014 away.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried about the boat because we couldn\u2019t save it, there was no way we could\u2019ve saved it,\u201d he told Nine newspapers.\n\nDoran said they maintained constant radio contact with the Pacific Dawn\u2019s captain Alan Dockeray, who picked up the distress call when he was 55 nautical miles from their location. It was a very easy rescue, Dockeray said.\n\nAustralian man dead after falling from Royal Caribbean cruise ship Read more\n\nDockeray had been piloting 2,000 passengers in a seven-day cruise around the South Pacific and said he had rescued sailors from the waters around Vanuatu before.\n\n\u201cThe reefs there are unforgiving but these guys didn\u2019t find a reef, they found a mooring line,\u201d Dockeray said.\n\nJohnson told Nine News from aboard the Pacific Dawn on Thursday that the rope \u201ccompletely ripped through the bottom of the hull\u201d.\n\n\u201cFrom there it was just panic stations, and we had manual pumps going, bilge pumps going,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo we abandoned, we abandoned ship by then because it was already lifting and she was in ... very bad shape.\u201d", "description": "Seasoned sailors were picked up after their boat sank off the coast of New Caledonia", "authors": ["Calla Wahlquist"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f1b74973b57fe43df5c8ef58ea8273f5293e8b8/0_65_4632_2779/master/4632.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=780dac4eb4d3b5aaacb9096fe0d953bb", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
