Photo: Neon\n\nTwice in Bong Joon-ho\u2019s acid black comedy Parasite (which won the Palme d\u2019Or at this year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival), characters exclaim \u201cThat\u2019s a metaphor!\u201d about something they\u2019re looking at \u2014 which I took to be Bong poking fun at himself, as if Wes Anderson\u2019s characters were to announce that they live in a big dollhouse or Quentin Tarantino\u2019s that their existence is a masturbatory farrago of trash-movie tropes. The South Korean director thinks in metaphor. It\u2019s his m\u00e9tier. Consider the first shot of Parasite (the title itself is a metaphor): what looks to be an empty birdcage draped with socks in front of a window that\u2019s partially below street level. In this apartment, all dreams of flight have been extinguished (the socks reinforce the connection to the dirt), while the low vantage signals exclusion \u2014 a mocking one when the residents, the miserably destitute Kim family, have their view blocked by a drunken yuppie pissing against a wall. Stuck underground, the Kims \u2014 father, mother, teenage son, and 20-ish daughter \u2014 writhe over the depths to which they\u2019ve sunk, over their lack of connection. (They press against the ceiling to try to get a Wi-Fi signal.) They desperately need to attach themselves to something high off the ground. They long for airier metaphors.\n\nThe premise of Parasite is that the Kims, with guile and wiles, manage to insinuate themselves into the household of the wealthy Park family. The deception begins when a pal of the teenage son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), heads abroad and prevails on him to take over as tutor for the Parks\u2019 daughter, Da-hye (Jung Ji-so). Though Ki-woo isn\u2019t even in college, the subterfuge is easy; the pampered Parks are exquisitely gullible. When the younger Park boy, who suffers from a version of PTSD that turns out to have a strong metaphorical component, requires a therapist to work with him on art projects, Ki-woo puts the family in touch with his sister, Ki-jung (Park So-dam), though, to allay suspicions, he doesn\u2019t identify her as such. In short order, Ki-jung frames the Park chauffeur to get him fired, after which Ki-woo suggests their father, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), as a replacement, though he doesn\u2019t identify him as such; and soon they hoodwink the Parks into jettisoning their longtime housekeeper and hiring the Kim matriarch, Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), though she\u2019s not identified as such. In the gated Park manse \u2014 above the street, surrounded by trees, serenaded by birds \u2014 the incognito Kims feel affluent. When the Parks go on a camping trip, the Kims move in and savor the luxury and peace. They think they\u2019re a natural fit.\n\nThe first half of Parasite goes down easily \u2014 maybe too easily. The Kims\u2019 successes are too pat for suspense (is Ki-jung really that sensitive an art therapist out of the gate?), and Bong\u2019s frames are over-controlled. It seems like a one-joke movie. But then the bottom falls out of the joke (metaphorically and literally), and the tragedy of this jury-rigged society manifests itself in rage and blood.\n\nIt turns out \u2014 this could be construed as a spoiler, but it cracks the movie open and needs to be reckoned with \u2014 that there are people even lower than the Kims, people whose existence is entirely subterranean, who stink worse of mildew and excrement, whom the Kims must now keep down the way others have kept them down. By then, Bong has left social realism far behind and moved into horror-movie territory, into haunted houses, buried secrets, pop-up skeletons. As the tension builds, he veers into farce; the film\u2019s centerpiece is a marvel of split-second timing in which every prop \u2014 an illuminated tent on the lawn, a walkie-talkie, a flickering lightbulb \u2014 resonates like mad. The masterstroke? The sequence ends in melancholy, as Kim Sr. realizes (while hiding under a sofa, inches from discovery) that he was never as omnipotent as he thought. The Parks have been nice to him, his wife, and his children, but they can afford to be.\n\nYou could never call Bong subtle. After a symbolic rain causes the symbolic sewers to overflow and symbolically flood the Kims\u2019 symbolic basement apartment, Kim Sr. is forced to perform at the Parks\u2019 fancy house party in a symbolic Native American headdress. The climax, though surprising in its splatter quotient, is telegraphed.\n\nWhat keeps you rapt in Parasite is the visual wit \u2014 every shot distills the movie\u2019s themes \u2014 and the richness of the characters and performances: Song\u2019s stricken expression as Kim Sr. is driven to murder by class resentment, Lee Jeong-eun\u2019s swift transformation from a calmly efficient housekeeper to a keening madwoman, and Choi\u2019s eloquent helplessness as his teenage protagonist watches this new world order gorily combust. Bong has a gift for creating believably interdependent families, each its own ecosystem. The temptation must have been strong to make the wealthy Parks cartoons of privilege, but they\u2019re actually likable. Jo Yeo-jeong\u2019s mother is a wispy, fragile beauty who\u2019s in over her head amid the opulence, while Lee Sun-kyun\u2019s Park Sr. is the perfect capitalist cover boy, trim and focused in all things. He does not have peripheral vision, but he doesn\u2019t need it to thrive in his world. You could say he functions better without it.\n\nAt the heart of Parasite is the most gnawing evolutionary fear of all, the inability to protect one\u2019s family. Parents work to save their children but lose them, as children lose their parents and wives their husbands. The bonds are firm but can withstand only so much pressure before they fracture. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor? Or is the system itself the parasite, drawing its energy from the turbulent interaction between rich and poor? As in Jordan Peele\u2019s even more outlandish Us, the central metaphor eats into the mind. We are feeding on each other. Comeuppance comes up from below.\n\n*A version of this article appears in the October 14, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
