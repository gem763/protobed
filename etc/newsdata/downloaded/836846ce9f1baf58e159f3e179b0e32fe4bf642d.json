Let\u2019s see how, in his 2,273 words in Monday night\u2019s debate, Maxime Bernier stacks up. (Yes, I did count. The other leaders had: Scheer 4,037, Trudeau 3,824, Singh 3,780, May 3,446 and Blanchet 2,254. The transcript records two interventions by \u201cUnidentified male\u201d but I didn\u2019t count those.)\n\nMind you, there\u2019s more to Bernier than what he said Monday night. He had a mixed record as a federal minister, great in Industry, not so good in Foreign Affairs, where his relaxed view of document security got him canned. Forming his own party may well have been an act of personal pique \u2014 albeit well-earned pique after the Conservative leadership was snatched away from him by the dairy cartel. And his new party has attracted support from decidedly unsavoury sorts. In 10 days, voters will be judging his full bio, just as they will with the other candidates. But for now, let\u2019s look at what he did say Tuesday.\n\nWhat did Bernier say?\n\n\u201cThe UN is a dysfunctional organization.\u201d Few conservatives will disagree.\n\n\u201cExtreme multiculturalism \u2026 is not the way to build this country.\u201d Diversity is fine, it\u2019s welcome, in fact, but policies that reinforce ethnic separateness are not.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to have a discussion about \u2026 immigration.\u201d Discussion should not be a problem. Our current target of 350,000 immigrants a year was not revealed by the Divine. Anyone who knows anything about social science knows that \u201coptimal immigrant flows\u201d and the like are essentially incalculable. But then why would Bernier\u2019s target of 150,000 be best? Going for more economic immigrants and fewer family members and refugees might serve various growth and redistribution goals but are there moral problems in stripping poor countries of their most talented people? Tough questions. But by all means let\u2019s discuss. Bernier\u2019s \u201cEverybody is welcome in this country\u201d sets a good tone for the debate, even if it\u2019s a good bet not everybody in his party agrees. The test of his sincerity will be stamping out the bigoted fringe.\n\n\u201cYou must believe in people. You must give back their money in their own pockets.\u201d Check.\n\n\u201c(Canadian values include:) Equality before the law, equality between man and woman.\u201d Of course.\n\n\u201cWe need to celebrate who we are and we\u2019re not doing that.\u201d We certainly weren\u2019t doing it during our 150th birthday guilt-fest in 2017.\n\nTo Elizabeth May: \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to create any wealth with your policies. You have the same kind of policies (as) in socialist countries like Venezuela. That won\u2019t create any wealth.\u201d Ms. May seems kind, gentle and un-revolutionary but she does propose a complete overhaul of the economy by regulatory fiat.\n\n\u201cWe have the right in this country to debate ideas, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Who could disagree? Well, Jagmeet Singh, for one, whose explanation for why he thought Bernier\u2019s various tweets should have disqualified him from the debate almost directly preceded a question from a lady in B.C. asking \u201chow will you ensure that all voices across the political spectrum are heard and considered?\u201d By shutting them down, I guess.\n\n\u201cI will respect the Constitution. I will respect provinces \u2026 I won\u2019t interfere in health care because it is a provincial jurisdiction \u2026 Pharmacare is a provincial jurisdiction, Mr. Singh, it\u2019s a provincial jurisdiction.\u201d Classic conservative views these.\n\n\u201cEverybody here on this stage (is) spending more money \u2026 We want the private sector to be able to invest. The private sector works quite well \u2026 Where will you find the money? In our pockets.\u201d Amen.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying you\u2019re for pipelines (Mr. Scheer) but you don\u2019t have the courage to use the Constitution to be sure that we\u2019ll have pipelines in this country for the unity \u2026 and prosperity of our country.\u201d And he goes on to mention Section 92.10 of the Constitution, which gives the federal government jurisdiction over interprovincial transportation and communication and \u201cworks for the general Advantage of Canada.\u201d That\u2019s John A. Macdonald conservatism.\n\n\u201cWe are the only party that will try to implement property rights on reserve and also establish a relationship based on self-reliance for these communities.\u201d Property rights may be a \u201csettler\u201d concept, as progressives would call it, but how many societies have delivered high standards of living without well-defined individual property rights?\n\n\u201cWhat I like from you, Elizabeth, you don\u2019t want any subsidies to the oil and gas industry, and I don\u2019t believe in corporate subsidies, also in corporate welfare, so we can agree on that.\u201d The cross-party comity is probably premature. I\u2019m guessing Elizabeth May loves subsidies for wind, solar, biomass and all sorts of other energy sources (except nuclear) that aren\u2019t viable without them.\n\n\u201cWe are the only party that will balance the budget in two years \u2026 I promise you to do nothing except balance the budget and after that lower your taxes. That\u2019s the only responsible policy \u2026 Mr. Scheer and Mr. Trudeau, it\u2019s all the same. It\u2019s all boutique tax credits.\u201d That\u2019s a little harsh: Scheer cuts the first income tax rate from 15 to 13.75 per cent while Trudeau raises the basic personal amount for people under $147,000. But most readers of this page \u2014 and I suspect most writers on this page \u2014 will not disagree.\n\nOn climate: \u201cWe want to do things that are possible. We want to do things that are possible to protect our health, our air, our environment, our water \u2026 I believe that there\u2019s no climate emergency.\u201d It not being clear what the true conservative position on climate is, I\u2019ll stop the quotes there.\n\nChoice is good but sometimes hard. Voters on Canada\u2019s right now face the same dilemma voters on its left have struggled with for decades. Vote for the Liberals, whose hearts may be way left but who cling calculatingly to the centre, where the votes are? Or vote for the \u201cLiberals in a hurry\u201d? It\u2019s not always an easy choice. Andrew Scheer is doing his best to cling to the centre. Max Bernier is a conservative in a hurry. Good luck with your choice, conservatives.\n\nFinancial Post", "description": "Voters on Canada\u2019s right now face the same dilemma voters on its left have struggled with for decades.
