Per the New York Times, Domingo withdrew from the Met on Tuesday morning, just one day before the opening of Verdi\u2019s Macbeth. \u201cWhile I strongly dispute recent allegations made about me, and I am concerned about a climate in which people are condemned without due process, upon reflection I believe that my appearance in this production of Macbeth would distract from the hard work of my colleagues both onstage and behind the scenes,\u201d Domingo said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, I have asked to withdraw and I thank the leadership of the Met for graciously granting my request.\u201d The Met, in an additional statement, said Domingo had \u201cagreed to withdraw.\u201d\n\nTwenty women have come forward to claim Domingo had sexually harassed them over the course of a 30-year period.
