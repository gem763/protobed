REUTERS/Ruben Sprich/File Photo\n\nBarton, 56, a Ugandan-born Canadian who stepped down as global managing partner of consulting firm McKinsey & Co last year, has extensive experience in China and is close to Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government.\n\n\u201cHis years of experience in Asia, and the significant global economics expertise he has acquired over an impressive career, will make him a great choice,\u201d Trudeau said in a statement.\n\nBarton replaces John McCallum, who Trudeau fired in January for commenting on the case of a Huawei Technologies Co executive who was arrested in Canada and is fighting extradition to the United States.\n\nBeijing, which has demanded Canada return Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, has blocked imports of Canadian canola seed and pork and beef products. It has also charged two Canadian men with spying.\n\nCanada\u2019s Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, noting \u201csome significant challenges in the relationship,\u201d said it was vital to choose an envoy who Beijing knew would have direct access to Trudeau.\n\nShe also told reporters in Toronto that Barton would be expected to stress the importance of human rights, a highly sensitive topic for the Chinese government.\n\nSpeaking in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the government had approved Barton\u2019s appointment, and hoped he would \u201cplay a positive role in getting China-Canada relations back on track.\u201d\n\nGeng reiterated that the problems in the relationship were entirely Canada\u2019s responsibility, and again urged Canada to reflect on its mistakes and release Huawei\u2019s Meng.\n\nMARKET ACCESS\n\nBusiness and agricultural groups welcomed the announcement. In 2016, the Canadian government appointed Barton as head of an advisory council on economic growth.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased with the appointment and the signal that both sides see the importance of returning to normal bilateral relations,\u201d said Goldy Hyder, President and chief executive officer of the Business Council of Canada.\n\nThe news indicates the two governments are still talking despite months of fraught ties.\n\n\u201cThis is the outcome of a months-long diplomatic process,\u201d a Canadian government official said earlier on Wednesday.\n\nGary Stordy, director of government and corporate affairs at the Canadian Pork Council, said the appointment was \u201cthe next step to normalizing relations between the two countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to regain market access into China,\u201d he added.\n\nThe dispute could become an issue in a federal election set for Oct 21. The Liberals face a tough fight against the Conservatives of Andrew Scheer, who complain Trudeau has not been tough enough on Beijing.\n\nConservative foreign policy spokesman Erin O\u2019Toole accused Trudeau of \u201creplacing one Liberal insider with another Liberal insider at a time that we should have a professional diplomat ... to secure the swift release of Canadian citizens and stabilization of export trade.\u201d", "description": "Canada has appointed veteran business consultant Dominic Barton as ambassador to China, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday, as the government grapples with a major diplomatic and trade dispute between the nations.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426470371&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF831ZA-OCATP"}
