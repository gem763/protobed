Gran Turismo may have more options, modding, and a broader range of cars, and the Forza series may have more content and a fuller compendium of off-track distractions, but if you want to drive cars fast Codemasters has always been the go-to for rock solid racing that just feels right.\n\nDelayed from its original September release date, GRID is the follow up to 2014\u2019s GRID Autosport, which was itself a light revision of GRID 2. That game caused unexpected controversy by doing away with the mystifyingly popular in-cockpit view, a move that some purists regarded as a betrayal of everything they held dear. Autosport put it back in, and armchair racing drivers will be relieved to learn that GRID returns with the full array of camera angles, from two distances of chase cam to front bumper and in-car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other accusation levelled at Autosport was its relative lack of content, and GRID does little to deflect that particular criticism. Aside from the single-player career mode\u2019s 100 or so events set across 22 locations, there\u2019s online-only multiplayer and free play \u2013 where you can set up a one-off event \u2013 but that\u2019s it. Codemasters promises over 90 more career events over the coming six months, at least for those who spring for the \u00a374.99 Ultimate Edition or buy a season pass. For everyone else, that\u2019s your lot.\n\nYou\u2019ll also find team management maintained at a bare minimum. You can change team-mates from a continually changing roster, each one rated for loyalty, skill, attack, and defence. They also all have their own race fee, a percentage of winnings that acts as their pay cheque, but as with GRID Autosport there\u2019s no more dealing with sponsors, and your team, while adding a small amount to winnings, quietly takes a back seat during most of the game.\n\nIt\u2019s just as well that the racing is as close to being perfect as is imaginable with current technology. As ever, it\u2019s Codemasters\u2019 spectacularly realistic and consistent handling model that really sells it. The way you can feel your car\u2019s weight loading onto the outside tyres going into corners or experience moments of lift-off understeer as you take a bend against the camber of the road is just fantastic. It\u2019s subtle, hugely enjoyable, and never lets realism get in the way of a good time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarving a path that artfully threads its way between arcade sensation and fanatical realism, you can further adapt to track conditions and your style of driving by tuning your car before races. You can also pause mid-game to tinker with driving assists, AI driver difficulty, and whether to have the racing line painted on the road. There\u2019s no car modification though, so what you see is what you get with the game\u2019s 90-odd launch cars.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of variety in there though, with vehicle types that range from American stock cars and pick-up trucks to touring cars. That offers good diversity in terms of handling, complemented by global courses including sun-baked Barcelona, the narrow streets of San Francisco, high-tech Shanghai, the crumbling buildings of Havana, and the ultra-high stakes of the fictional Okutama circuit, which, like the N\u00fcrburgring, lets you build up enough speed that even fractional errors can have catastrophic consequences.\n\nFortunately, GRID retains the series\u2019 rewind function, which you can use up to five times per race, letting you erase your most egregious mistakes by reversing time for a few seconds and giving things another try. That\u2019s especially effective in GRID, which adds car damage, something that goes beyond simple cosmetics. It\u2019s now possible to write off your car mid-race, forcing you to quit or start again.\n\nGRID (PS4) \u2013 if only there was more of it\n\nIt\u2019s not easy getting car manufacturers to agree to show their licensed vehicles being smashed to bits, but Codemasters has managed it, albeit that none of them gets too badly disfigured. You will occasionally lose a bonnet or bumper, but more often than not it\u2019s just scratched paint and smashed headlights. It\u2019s still a refreshing change though and makes in-race pile-ups both more spectacular and nerve-racking, because car damage isn\u2019t your only concern in a collision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other is AI drivers, who sometimes take umbrage at too many knocks or being slammed into at high speed and will be flagged as your nemesis, going out of their way to inflict righteous justice on you for the rest of the race. Drive too recklessly and you can end up with multiple nemeses, all of whom want nothing more than to run you off the track. It\u2019s a system that admittedly doesn\u2019t make a huge difference to races, but does add a small extra layer of refinement, which is all you need when the AI is generally so good.\n\nThere\u2019s none of the obvious rubber-banding of less accomplished racing games; instead you get tough, human-seeming competition. That said, you can occasionally circumvent pretty much the whole pack on the first corner, by braking stupidly late and using a frontrunner\u2019s car to slow yourself down. They, of course, instantly become your nemesis, but provided you drive okay you may not see them again anyway. It\u2019s not something that happens often, and especially in later events most races are closely fought battles that are only decided in the final lap.\n\nWe weren\u2019t able to find multiplayer matches pre-release, but previous Codemasters racers suggest they will be equally competent, even if Autosport\u2019s split screen couch co-op will be sorely missed. GRID is also compatible with a range of steering wheels for those who like to get a bit deeper into their simulation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other good news, GRID is an exceptionally good-looking game, the smoke from your tyres, glowing brake discs, and crunching impacts with barriers and fellow racers making for spectacles that are rarely less than dazzling. Cheering fans leap back from the trackside as you slam into a barrier, and finishes are accompanied by ticker tape and fireworks. It even has noticeably short loading times, which is a gift that keeps on giving.\n\nLike its predecessor, GRID is a superb driving game that positions itself artfully between hardcore and casual. It looks good, has highly proficient AI competition, and a good range of cars that won\u2019t force you to start with a Ford Fiesta \u2013 we\u2019re looking at you, Gran Turismo. There\u2019s not that much of it though, and with limited team management and a modest career mode, its season pass content will need to be exceptional to make up for that.\n\nGRID review summary In Short: Some of the finest simulated driving you can find on PC and console, but with a single-player career mode that\u2019s not as fully fleshed out as you\u2019d expect for the money. Pros: The best-handling of any driving game this gen. 90+ cars, none of which are boring. Beautiful-looking tracks from around the world. Good rival driver AI, and the nemesis system is a great idea. Cons: Relatively brief career mode. Not as many courses as past outings and season pass content that will add to an already expensive purchase. Score: 7/10\n\nFormats: PlayStation 4 (reviewed), Xbox One, PC, and Stadia\n\nPrice: \u00a354.99\n\nDeveloper: Codemasters\n\nPublisher: Codemasters\n\nRelease Date: 11th October 2019\n\nAge Rating: 3\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Grid Autosport Switch review \u2013 Reader\u2019s Feature\n\nMORE: GRID Autosport on iOS reader\u2019s review \u2013 Reader\u2019s Feature\n\nMORE: F1 2019 review \u2013 on the podium but falls short of the championship", "description": "Codemasters reboots one of its most iconic racing series with some of the best graphics and car-handling ever seen on a console.", "authors": ["Nick Gillet"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GRID_keyart_A4WIDE-7dc5_1570465941.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
