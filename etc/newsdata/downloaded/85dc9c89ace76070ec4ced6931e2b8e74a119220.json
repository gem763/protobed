(Matthew Tsang)\n\n\u201cThe Starters\u201d have found a new home in time for the NBA season. The popular quartet has joined The Athletic and will launch a new daily podcast next week. Tas Melas, Leigh Ellis, Trey Kerby and Phil Elder (professionally known as J.E. Skeets) were free agents after Turner did not renew their contract earlier this year following six years of hosting an irreverent TV show on NBA TV.\n\nThe podcast, titled \u201cNo Dunks,\u201d will be available outside The Athletic\u2019s paywall and will feature the daily musings of the four hosts in their trademark quirky style. Before their run on TV, \u201cThe Starters\u201d were among the first media personalities to create a podcast and eventually joined Grantland\u2019s podcast network before creating the TV show.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be what people know when it comes to our NBA coverage,\u201d Elder said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re getting back to our roots in podcasting and we\u2019re going to be talking every day about games, big stories and really the hilarity of the NBA.\u201d\n\n[\u2018The Starters\u2019 will not return to NBA TV next season]\n\nThe show will feature a healthy dose of the irreverence \u201cThe Starters\u201d are known for \u2014 during NBA summer league two years ago, the four hosts dressed as Las Vegas showgirls \u2014 as well as give The Athletic, a subscription sports website specializing in local team-by-team coverage, another platform to showcase the work of its growing stable of writers.\n\nIn addition to quirky humor, the hosts have plans to interview Athletic writers about their biggest NBA stories. \u201cThe idea is to draw from our newsroom and highlight the news from The Athletic that\u2019s driven by people on the front lines with these teams,\u201d said Nick Adler, The Athletic\u2019s general manager of audio. \u201cAdding audio makes the ecosystem that much better for subscribers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Starters\u201d have plans for additional podcast series that would be available behind The Athletic\u2019s paywall that could feature trivia games, mail bags and long-form interviews with local writers.\n\nAdler said the company now has more than 100 distinct podcasts with the hopes of reaching 120 by the end of the year. Last month, The Athletic launched another free daily podcast, \u201cThe Lead,\u201d a general interest show that focuses on a single story each episode, similar to \u201cThe Daily\u201d from the New York Times. The format for many of its team-specific audio offerings is one free episode per week and another behind the paywall. (Episodes of \u201cNo Dunks\u201d will include advertisements.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about reaching a broader audience,\u201d Adler said. \u201cI think we see putting things outside the paywall as a way for more people to find out about The Athletic.\"\n\nIn July, Bloomberg reported The Athletic, which was launched in 2016, has around 600,000 paying subscribers following a push into Britain to cover Premier League soccer.\n\nThe deal was negotiated on behalf of \u201cThe Starters\u201d by Creative Artists Agency representatives Matt Olson and Michael Klein. Terms allow \u201cThe Starters\u201d to pursue a separate deal for video content, meaning they could partner with another media outlet on a rebooted TV show or simply simulcast tapings of the podcast.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nSports Illustrated shaken by major layoffs and massive reorganization\n\nDAZN\u2019s next attempt at buzz: A boxing match between YouTube stars Logan Paul and KSI\n\nAndrew Luck retired young, and was hailed for his courage.
