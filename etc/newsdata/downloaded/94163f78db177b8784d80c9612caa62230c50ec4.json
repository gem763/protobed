MPs and experts urged the civil service chief, Sir Mark Sedwill, to intervene to make clear the UK was highly unlikely to leave without a deal on that day.\n\nHowever, Led By Donkeys has taken a characteristically satirical axe to the \u00a3100m advertising campaign, launching a mock-up of a government website and an online tool that lets users design their own \u201cget ready\u201d poster. The competition can be entered by going to ledbydonkeys.com.\n\nLed By Donkeys registered NoDealBrexit.info when the government campaign was first announced and set up a crowdfunding drive to pay for a rival campaign, which has so far raised more than \u00a3160,000.\n\nIannucci said: \u201cAll we are doing is taking back control of our billboards. Together, we can spaff posters on to prime advertising space and send a message. That message is: \u2018Please help us, God.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Brexit crisis: what is the state of play between the parties? Read more\n\nWill Rose of Led By Donkeys said: \u201cIf you absolutely must launch a \u00a3100m propaganda campaign at taxpayers\u2019 expense to make Brexit feel inevitable, at least make it good.\n\n\u201cInstead Johnson and Gove have come up with a cross between a supermarket\u2019s own-brand pasta packaging and the 1980s England football kit. It\u2019s a colossal waste of money.\n\n\u201cThink how many nurses and teachers they could have hired instead. Their own analysis shows their policy could lead to shortages of food and medicine but their lifeless, turgid information campaign doesn\u2019t mention any of that.\u201d\n\nThe deadline for submissions to the competition is midnight on Wednesday 2 October.", "description": "Pro-remain group\u2019s website encourages public to redesign government campaign", "authors": ["Ben Quinn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5a885d2f3bb57f60b2937182aa6a050d8e3182d/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=532133252ec12199e8f3e8bee326bb17", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
