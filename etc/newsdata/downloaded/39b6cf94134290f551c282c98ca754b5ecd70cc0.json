England went on to lose that match but it was very much the announcement of May\u2019s arrival at Test level.\n\nThe wing would go on to add five more tries by the end of 2015, which ended with a whimper in the form of England\u2019s humiliating pool-stage exit from their own World Cup. In the four years since Eddie Jones took charge of the national team, May has scored 18 tries in 28 matches \u2013 27 of which have all been starts - which included a phenomenal run over the past year-and-a-half of 14 in 15 games. Simply put, May heads into the Rugby World Cup with one of the most dangerous records in the game.\n\nIf the 29-year-old can maintain that try-rate over the next three years at an average of 10 Tests a year, he has a realistic chance of taking down Rory Underwood\u2019s ridiculous all-time record of 49 tries in 85 appearances, the most scored by any Englishman in the amateur or professional era.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut personal accolades don\u2019t really matter to May \u2013 at least not any more. One thing that Jones has implemented since taking the reins is the mantra that the team comes first, no matter what, and May is better than most in not only projecting this philosophy but explaining how a shift in his own mentality has helped him to buy into it.\n\n\u201cThe message from when Eddie has come in is that he will pick a team to beat that opposition on that day and everyone has a role,\u201d May said. \u201cIf you are not involved then you are helping the team prepare, if you are a finisher you are going to finish. It is not \u2018who is better than who\u2019. We are not about that on this team. We are about \u2018okay this is the team for that day\u2019 and this is the team that we need to prepare to win, no matter what your role is.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

RWC100: 100-81 1/21 Which Rugby World Cup star will come out on top? 2/21 100: Michael Leitch The Japan captain is preparing to lead the side into yet another World Cup, but he proved an inspiring figure in 2015 as his phenomenal work-rate set the example for those around him. He will forever be remembered as the man who lead the side that defeated the Springboks. Getty Images 3/21 99: Lewis Moody A member of the 2003 winning squad, Moody went on to feature on the 2007 run to the final before captaining the ill0fated 2011 campaign. However, with three tournaments under his belt and his sheer bravery in every one of his performances, he just squeezes onto the list. Getty Images 4/21 98: Ben Franks The two-time Rugby World Cup winner lined up in the same front-row as younger brother Owen to help the All Blacks to back-to-back world championships, before heading to Europe. Getty Images 5/21 97: Diego Dominguez A legend of the Italian game. Dominguez played at three consecutive World Cups between 1991 and 1999 and displayed a talent at fly-half that is yet to be displayed since. Getty Images 6/21 96: Toutai Kefu It takes something special to oust Willie Ofahengaue from the Australian No 8 shirt, but Kefu was able to do exactly that to play a pivotal role as the Wallabies' starting No 8 at the triumphant Rugby World Cup. Getty Images 7/21 95: Va'aiga Tuigamala 'Inga the winger' has the unusual accolade of playing at two Rugby World Cups for two different nations. He arrived on the scene with New Zealand in 1991, but it was his role in 1999 with Western Samoa that really caught the eye as he helped them defeat Wales. AFP/Getty Images 8/21 94: Sebastien Chabal A World Cup winner he is not, but Chabal provided one of the great moments in the tournament's history as he lead the confrontation to the Haka ahead of France's 2007 World Cup quarter-final victory over the All Blacks. AFP/Getty Images 9/21 93: Mamuka Gorgodze Probably no better example of a man who has carried a national team on his own shoulders. Gorgodze was famously named man of the match against New Zealand, and his reaction said all that you needed to know about what it means to him to play for Georgia. AFP/Getty Images 10/21 92: Mickey Skinner Who can forget 'The Tackle'? Mick 'The Munch' Skinner sent Marc Cecillon in reverse with one fo the great World Cup tackles during England's quarter-final victory at the 1991 tournament. Getty Images 11/21 91: Stephen Donald Not New Zealand's first choice, or second, or third, but the fourth-choice fly-half who wasn't even named in the All Blacks squad for the 2011 World Cup. Injuries meant he was drafted in for the final against France, where he wrote his name into the history books by kicking the final-winning penalty to end the All Blacks' 24 years of hurt. AFP/Getty Images 12/21 90: Takudza Ngwenya Bryan Habana was considered that fastest man at the World Cup - until Ngwenya turned up and completely roasted him on the outside. The United States may have gone on to lose the match, but the moment remains one of the 2007 tournament highlights. AFP/Getty Images 13/21 89: Thierry Lacroix Lacroix's international career never really took off until the 1999 World Cup when a scintillating 30-minute display paved the way for the All Blacks's dramatic exit. AFP/Getty Images 14/21 88: Karne Hesketh If this list was judged on moments alone, Hesketh would be No 1 on the list. The Japan wing finished one of the great tries to secure their first ever victory over the Springboks, a moment where everyone who was watching remembers exactly where they were at that moment in time. Getty Images 15/21 87: Andrew Sheridan Sheridan played in two World Cup, but is fondly remembered for the way he dismantled the Australian scrum in 2007 to form the basis for England's quarter-final victory. Getty Images 16/21 86: Josh Lewsey Lewsey was one-third of England's elite back-three at the 2003 World Cup, but his tournament highlight came in 2007 when he scored inside 80 seconds in the semi-final victory over France. Getty Images 17/21 85: Will Genia An Australian centurion who was first-choice scrum-half in both 2011 and 2015, where he claimed third and second-place finishes respectively. Will 2019 be the year he goes one better? Getty Images 18/21 84: Will Greenwood The centre enjoyed a phenomenal World Cup try-scoring record of seven in nine matches across 1999 and 2003, going on to help England triumph Down Under. Getty Images 19/21 83: Gavin Hastings Arguably Scotland's greatest ever player, who featured across three World Cups - the final one in 1995 as captain - before hanging up his boots after their quarter-final defeat against the Springboks. Getty Images 20/21 82: David Pocock The main reason that Australia made it to the 2015 Rugby World Cup final, Pocock starred playing out of position in a partnership with Michael Hooper that has strongly influenced the 2019 tournament as other teams follow suit. Getty Images 21/21 81: Tendai Mtawarira Despite his nickname of 'The Beast', Tendai Mtawarira is possibly one of the most understated greats of the game. Fans love him and for good reason, having helped South Africa to third place in 2015.

A walk back through time lists the who\u2019s who of try-scoring when it comes to the World Cup, with Bryan Habana, Jonah Lomu, John Kirwan and David Campese all wings to have won the award. Any player who scores tries for a living, as May does, would love to get their hands on such a gong, given it has a direct correlation to a team\u2019s performance. Right?\n\n\u201cThat is a terrible trap to fall into, to go into a game wanting to score a try or trying to score a try,\u201d he adds. \u201cOf course scoring a try for a winger is the cherry on top of the cake, but we have got so many good players, I couldn\u2019t care if I don\u2019t score a try in the whole tournament. We just need to win every game.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to score tries if we just stick to doing our job. For me, I go into a game focusing on my defence, my kick-chase, my high ball. Those are the things I am guaranteed to get in a game. If the opportunity comes to score a try, that is my role in that moment for the team. But to go into games thinking about wanting to do that? That is not how Test match rugby works.\u201d\n\nThe Leicester Tigers back is right to talk up his teammates, given this is one of the most attacking squads England have sent to a World Cup since at least 2003, and possibly even beyond. May is joined on the wing by Anthony Watson, who is just a shade slower than May and has gone about returning to the level that earned him a British and Irish Lions Test spot since coming back from serious injury, as well as the powerful Joe Cokanasiga, workhorse Jack Nowell and unheralded Ruaridh McConnochie. Throw full-back Elliot Daly into the mix too, and England boast one of the most potent groups of outside backs in Japan.\n\nThat batch of speed, strength and ability will line up outside the likes of Manu Tuilagi, Billy Vunipola and Maro Itoje, a trio among the very best in their positions on the planet, which gives England something they have lacked for 16 years: dangerous threats throughout the entire team.\n\n\u201cIt is nothing like I have ever been a part of,\u201d said May. \u201cI look around the room and the teammates and the talent we have, and depth as well, for me the belief is genuine that we can beat anybody if we are at our best and I genuinely believe we will peak at this World Cup.\n\n\u201cNobody needs to pull a rabbit out of the hat because the talent is so good that people just doing their jobs is going to be enough and that is a great position to be in. We don\u2019t need to force anything, just go out there and play a simple game because something will happen eventually because we have great players and a great team.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to come across as arrogant because I am not, but I generally just can\u2019t talk up my teammates enough in terms of we have got players who can take the ball to the line and make decisions, we have got players who can run over people, we have got speed, we have got left foot options.\u201d\n\nMay could be forgiven if he said something similar before 2015, but there is a notable difference in the belief of these players that should prevent the same disappointment unfolding once again. It resides in the belief they have not in themselves, but in those around them, and May is not the first, nor will he be the last, to talk up his teammates over the next six weeks.", "description": "It took Jonny May eight international appearances to score his first England\u00a0try: a breath-taking solo effort against the All Blacks five years ago.
