(Yara Nardi/Reuters)\n\nEuropean leaders and merchants on Thursday slammed Trump administration plans to impose hefty tariffs on a wide array of European goods after the World Trade Organization ruled in favor of the United States in a long-brewing dispute over subsidies for European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.\n\nPending final approval from the WTO later this month, the Trump administration intends to impose tariffs on about $7.5 billion in European goods, including certain Italian cheeses, British-made cashmere sweaters and, one of President Trump\u2019s favorite targets, French wines. The tariffs \u2014 as high as 25 percent on agricultural and industrial products \u2014 could take effect as soon as Oct. 18, exacerbating concerns over a possible transatlantic trade war.\n\nUlrich Adam, director general of Europe\u2019s largest spirits lobby, decried the White House\u2019s decision as a misguided step that targets industries unrelated to the core of the growing U.S.-E.U. trade dispute, which centers on aircraft manufacturers.\n\n[U.S. can impose tariffs on $7.5 billion in goods because E.U. gave illegal subsidies to Airbus, WTO rules]\n\n\u201cAs a totally unrelated sector, it is unacceptable for the spirits producers having to pay the price for a dispute that is essentially about civil aircraft subsidies,\u201d Adam said in a statement released Thursday. \u201cIt is particularly irritating to see that unrelated sectors like ours will be hit by an extra 25 percent tariffs when the sector at stake will only be imposed a 10 percent rate!\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration plans to impose tariffs of 10 percent on European aircraft.\n\nCecilia Malmstrom, the European Union\u2019s top trade official, said in a statement after the WTO decision on Wednesday that, regardless of the ruling, her department opposes retaliatory U.S. countermeasures.\n\n\u201cWe remain of the view that even if the United States obtains authorization from the WTO Dispute Settlement Body, opting for applying countermeasures now would be shortsighted and counterproductive,\u201d she said.\n\nCountermeasures, Malmstrom continued, \u201cwould only inflict damage on businesses and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic, and harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time.\u201d\n\n\n\nBottles of French red wine are displayed at the Chateau du Pavillon in Sainte-Croix-du-Mont, France, on July 29, 2019. (Regis Duvignau/Reuters)\n\nThe E.U., meanwhile, is waiting on a separate WTO ruling next year over the complaint it lodged that Boeing, a U.S. manufacturer and Airbus\u2019s principal rival, has likewise benefited from illegal government support.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, celebrated the WTO ruling as a \u201cvictory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. won a $7.5 Billion award from the World Trade Organization against the European Union, who has for many years treated the USA very badly on Trade due to Tariffs, Trade Barriers, and more,\u201d he wrote on Twitter early Thursday. \u201cThis case going on for years, a nice victory!\u201d\n\nBut Trump seems to take particular pleasure in singling out French wines.\n\nIn July, French President Emmanuel Macron signed into law legislation that grants the French government the authority to levy special taxes on certain revenue that large U.S. tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple generate in France.\n\nThat move angered Trump, who immediately threatened a trade war through proposed tariffs on French wines specifically.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have done this,\u201d Trump, a self-professed teetotaler, told reporters at the time. \u201cI told them, I said, \u2018Don\u2019t do it because if you do it, I\u2019m going to tax your wine.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat threat did not sit well in France, where wines are among the most cherished national symbols. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked American wines better than French wines \u2014 even though I don\u2019t drink wine,\u201d Trump said in July. \u201cI just like the way they look, okay?\u201d\n\nAnxieties over tariffs have also inspired dramatic gestures in Europe, especially in the presence of U.S. officials. Earlier this week, for instance, an Italian satirical journalist interrupted a meeting between Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to offer a pound and a half of authentic Italian cheese to Pompeo.\n\n\u201cThis is Parmigiano-Reggiano, and this is what we make best in Italy,\u201d she said.\n\nEuropean officials urged a peaceful resolution of the dispute within the framework of the WTO.\n\n\u201cAn amicable resolution of the Boeing/Airbus litigation is the right solution,\u201d France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said on Twitter in response to the WTO ruling. \u201cUS sanctions would be an economic and political mistake.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nTrump is threatening tariffs on Europe\u2019s cheese and wine.
