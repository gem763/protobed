That includes U.S. President Donald Trump not escalating the tariff war with China, the U.K. finding a resolution to Brexit and central banks continuing their monetary stimulus, Zandi explained. \"I think high, uncomfortably high,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" when asked about the chances of a global economic recession.\n\nOther economists appeared less worried about a recession, but shared Zandi's sentiment that growth would continue to weaken. Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University, said consumer spending has helped support growth in several economies \u2014 even as momentum falters in other sectors. But that's not sustainable, he added. \"Consumers and households cannot be counted on to keep growth going. So, really, the key is to come up with a set of policies that are going to spur a revival of business and consumer confidence, and end up boosting investments,\" he told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" on Wednesday.\n\nMonetary and fiscal support\n\nOn Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund made a downward revision to global growth. In its World Economic Outlook report, the IMF forecast that the global economy will grow 3% this year and 3.4% in 2020. That's lower than the 3.2% and 3.5% \u2014 for 2019 and 2020, respectively \u2014 that the fund projected in July.", "description": "\"Even if we don't have a recession over the next 12-18 months, I think it's pretty clear that we're going to have a much weaker economy,\" says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics.", "authors": ["Yen Nee Lee"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105772087-1551660148475gettyimages-1064962028.jpeg?v=1571198984", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
