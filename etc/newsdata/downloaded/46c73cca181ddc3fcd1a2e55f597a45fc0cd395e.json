I hope this is what does it for him.\u201d\n\nNo worries. Wrabel more than justifies Pink\u2019s praise with his latest solo EP, a six-song collection of breezy, wistful pop titled \u201cone of those happy people.\u201d\n\nRecommendation from an artist of Pink\u2019s stature, on a huge platform like DeGeneres\u2019 show, was an overdue acknowledgment of a prolific, if still overlooked, talent. Over the past eight years, the Los Angeles-based Wrabel has co-written hits for Kesha, Adam Lambert and the Backstreet Boys, among other mainstream acts. Prior to joining Pink as a featured artist on her Beautiful Trauma Tour this summer, he opened for Broadway\u2019s Ben Platt on Platt\u2019s Sing to Me Instead Tour, playing to sold-out venues in Boston, New York and San Francisco, among other cities.\n\nWrabel\u2019s success with such musical heavyweights helped pave the way for him to release \u201cone of those happy people.\u201d Anthemic tracks like \u201cmagic\u201d and \u201clove to love you\u201d wouldn\u2019t feel out of a place alongside Maggie Rogers or Lana Del Rey on a Saturday morning playlist. (Check out the lyric video for \u201cmagic\u201d above.)\n\nThe collection\u2019s title is intentionally tongue-in-cheek, given that the singer-songwriter \u2014whose full name is Stephen Wrabel \u2014 has been known to bring on the heartbreak and those \u201csad piano vibes,\u201d he told HuffPost. Of course, he hasn\u2019t left his melancholy side behind completely, as the EP concludes with a tender ballad, \u201cflickers.\u201d\n\nYazz Alali Wrabel\u2019s \u201cone of those happy people\u201d marks a personal milestone, as the EP is his first major release as a fully independent artist.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t just made stuff so freely in a long time,\u201d Wrabel said of the EP, which was released last week. Writing for himself as opposed to an established pop artist, he added, afforded him the chance to \u201cput it out without too many hoops to jump through. Nowadays people come in and expect me to just write sad ballads. This almost feels like something I would\u2019ve made in college.\u201d\n\nThe EP marks another milestone in the 30-year-old\u2019s career, as \u201cone of those happy people\u201d marks his first major release as a fully independent artist recording on his own label. His 2014 debut EP, \u201cSideways,\u201d was released by Island Records. Later, he joined Epic Records, but he said he left that label in August 2018 after feeling creatively stifled.\n\n\u201cI really like record labels. I\u2019ve seen what they can do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I got out of the label system and was like, \u2018Screw them.\u2019 But when the machine starts to stall, when there\u2019s creative differences and when you\u2019re not all sharing the same kind of vision ... it can be really scary. It can feel like God is hitting \u2018pause\u2019 on your life or something.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving Epic last year, Wrabel founded Big Gay Records. The label\u2019s name is a bit of an inside joke: As Wrabel told Billboard last month, he once envisioned that he would set up shop in a \u201cbig rainbow [publishing] house\u201d in the heart of Nashville.\n\nWrabel, who is gay, has made sexuality and gender identity central to his work for some time. In 2017, he released \u201cThe Village,\u201d which he wrote after meeting two transgender fans not long before President Donald Trump rescinded federal protections for trans students in public schools. Directed by Dano Cerny, the video for the song follows a trans teen desperate to be accepted by their conservative family. It became a widely praised viral hit, receiving more than 8 million views on YouTube as of Monday morning.\n\nHe took a lighter, though nonetheless inclusive, approach in the video for his 2018 holiday song, \u201cFirst Winter,\u201d which showed him cuddling with a boyfriend in the back of a pickup truck after a Christmas-themed scavenger hunt.\n\nWhile \u201cone of those happy people\u201d may not contain such overt nods to LGBTQ themes, Wrabel doesn\u2019t consider the EP to be any less queer than his previous releases.\n\n\u201cI just write songs that are true,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cMy love songs are queer love songs. My breakup songs are queer breakup songs. I\u2019m very much queer, so it\u2019s definitely through that lens. But love, confusion over love, second-guessing ... that\u2019s just the human experience, really.\u201d\n\nMy love songs are queer love songs. My breakup songs are queer breakup songs. I\u2019m very much queer, so it\u2019s definitely through that lens. But love, confusion over love, second-guessing ... that\u2019s just the human experience. Wrabel\n\nThough Wrabel sees the music industry as \u201cin a really nice place with open arms\u201d as far as LGBTQ talent is concerned, he\u2019s concerned about listeners, many of whom he feels are still likely to \u201cwrite a queer artist off as a novelty or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more we keep creating, keep trucking on \u2015 in my mind, that\u2019s how we fight anything, really,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s so cool that some of the biggest songs in the world are written by queer people. The visibility of that is amazing, and that does kind of start changing things.\u201d\n\nOne way in which Wrabel plans to contribute to that visibility is by hitting the road. In October, he\u2019ll kick off the 11-date \u201chappy people sing sad songs\u201d tour, co-headlined by singer-songwriter Billy Raffoul, in Seattle.\n\nWade Payne/Invision/AP Wrabel co-wrote two tracks on Kesha's 2017 album, \"Rainbow.\" The pair also wrote \"Here Comes the Change\" for the 2018 Ruth Bader Ginsburg biopic, \"On the Basis of Sex.\"\n\nHe plans to get more studio time with Kesha, with whom he co-wrote \u201cHere Comes the Change\u201d for the 2018 Ruth Bader Ginsburg biopic, \u201cOn the Basis of Sex,\u201d as well as \u201cRich, White, Straight Men,\u201d which was released in June. He also names Sam Smith as one artist he hopes to collaborate with. But Wrabel said he\u2019s most fulfilled by working with up-and-coming talents, as \u201ctheir stuff feels so free and wide open.\u201d\n\nAs a whole, Wrabel said he feels more \u201ccomfortable and confident\u201d in his artistic skin than ever, and he hopes that translates into his music and upcoming performances.\n\n\u201cI think if you asked me two years ago, \u2018How\u2019s it going?\u2019 I would be like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, man. I\u2019m waiting for something,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNow I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m waiting for anything. I feel proud of myself in a new way.\u201d", "description": "After crafting hits for Pink and Adam Lambert, the singer-songwriter just dropped \"one of those happy people\" on his own label.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d72d0812300003300512687.jpeg?cache=l0cjmrpcyq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
