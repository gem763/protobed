Last month we talked about a city in Vermont where the village elders were debating a proposal to disarm their police force. You know\u2026 so they don\u2019t wind up shooting anyone. But that\u2019s just one relatively small city, so what\u2019s the harm, right?\n\nAs it turns out, there is a candidate for Congress in the Big Apple who has the same idea. And to put a cherry on this dish, he\u2019s being endorsed by Justice Democrats, the folks who brought you The Squad. (Free Beacon)\n\nA congressional candidate, who is endorsed by the same progressive group that backed Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) in 2018, recently called to disarm police officers. Jamaal Bowman, a New York City congressional candidate endorsed by Justice Democrats, has proposed taking guns from police officers in American cities. \u201cIt\u2019s time to disarm the police,\u201d Jamaal Bowman wrote on Twitter before retweeting one user\u2019s response that police in the United Kingdom \u201ccarry no guns\u201d and thus have \u201ckilled no citizens.\u201d\n\nJamaal Bowman is a middle school principal from the Bronx. (Just in case you were wondering why Gotham continues to descend toward full loony bin status every generation.) And he\u2019d like to represent his district in Congress. This molder of young minds thinks it might be a fine idea to disarm all the cops because, hey\u2026 that\u2019s how they do it in England and look how well things are going over there!\n\nExcept for one inconvenient detail, that is. The people in Great Britain don\u2019t have Second Amendment rights, so very few of their criminals are armed. (Guns still slip through sometimes, though.) And even with that reality in mind, the cops in England actually do have weapons. Only most of them don\u2019t carry them on the beat. But if they call in to HQ reporting a violent situation that\u2019s developing, more police with military-grade weaponry are dispatched to the scene at once.\n\nThe Free Beacon does a good job of breaking down this crazy proposal and why it makes no sense, particularly in New York City. First of all, New York doesn\u2019t have an epidemic of trigger-happy cops shooting up the innocent populace. There have been just 32 police shootings in New York City since 2015. Only one of the suspects was unarmed, though a second one had a realistic toy gun he pointed at officers. The rest were all armed and resisting arrest.\n\nAlso, one of the reasons that the Big Apple has been experiencing years of decreases in violent crime is that New York has one of the larger, tougher police forces in the country. They know how to keep the peace and take down the bad guys. And criminals know it. Sadly, it\u2019s been creeping back in the other direction recently under Bill de Blasio, but that\u2019s a subject for another column.\n\nHopefully, the voters in Principal Bowman\u2019s district will be smart enough to see this guy for what he is. Disarming the police is one of the dumber ideas to ever bubble up from the depths of the deep left bog. We don\u2019t need people endorsing such policies showing up and taking a seat in the House.", "description": "The party of mob rule", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NYPD.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
