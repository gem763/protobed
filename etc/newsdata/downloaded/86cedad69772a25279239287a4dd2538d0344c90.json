The Post, citing two sources, said the allegation involved a \u201cpromise\u201d made to a foreign leader.\n\nTrump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 to congratulate him on his election. According to the official readout on Ukraine's presidency website, \"Donald Trump is convinced that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.\"\n\nToward the end of August, the White House reportedly was considering whether to block $250 million of funds to support Ukraine\u2019s military in its war against Russian-backed separatists. On Sept. 12, however, that funding was released, and even increased. Congressional pressure played a role, and it is unclear whether the whistleblower\u2019s reported \u201cpromise\u201d allegations, made soon after the Zelensky phone call, did as well. (On Friday, Zelensky\u2019s office announced that he will meet with Trump next week.)\n\nWhat\u2019s certain is that American and Ukrainian politics are closely connected these days, and on Thursday evening Giuliani admitted he had asked officials in Ukraine to investigate Biden. Giuliani told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo in a contentious interview that there is nothing wrong with pressing for an investigation into corruption.\n\nOthers might call this whole affair a matter of political\u2014indeed, geopolitical\u2014extortion.\n\nAt a minimum, Giuliani\u2019s pressure has been interpreted here as weakening this country\u2019s institutions by pressing them to dig for dirt on Trump\u2019s most important Democratic challenger.\n\n\u201c Both the United States and Ukraine are throwing Biden\u2019s case at each other like a hot potato. \u201d \u2014 Serhiy Leshchenko, former member of Ukraine's parliament\n\nUkraine\u2019s law enforcement agencies believe that it is up to U.S. investigators to ascertain, specifically, whether Biden\u2019s son had any missed U.S. tax payments on income from Ukraine.\n\nHunter Biden actually took a job with the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holding in 2014 and worked there for five years, then quietly quit in April, soon after his father announced his presidential candidacy. It is unclear how much money Burisma paid Hunter Biden in total. Whatever it was, he may rue the work, given the political cost.\n\nEx-MP Serhiy Leshchenko, the Ukrainian pro-Western politician and corruption fighter, has been in the epicenter of the scandal since Giuliani mentioned his name as one of \u201cthe enemies of Donald Trump and the USA.\u201d The Trump attorney continued to criticize Ukraine\u2019s leadership by saying that Ukraine\u2019s president \u201cis surrounded by people who are the enemies of the president [Trump] and people who are clearly corrupt.\u201d\n\nAny word of criticism pronounced by such influential Americans may be damaging to careers here. As a result of Giuliani\u2019s statements, Leshchenko has lost a promising role on Zelensky\u2019s team. \u201cBoth the United States and Ukraine are throwing Biden\u2019s case at each other like a hot potato, pushing each other to begin investigating Biden,\u201d Leshchenko told The Daily Beast on Tuesday. \u201cI totally understand, and I don\u2019t want to be in the way, since Zelensky clearly does not want to quarrel with Trump. The United States is our main strategic partner and I value that.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, President Zelensky publicly thanked Trump for releasing the military aid vital for his country. Zelensky spoke at the annual Yalta European Strategy conference, which this year had a symbolic title: Happiness Now.\n\nUkraine elected Zelensky and his supporters in parliament by a landslide earlier this year, largely in response to the alleged corruption of his predecessor and amid hopes the former comedian-turned-politician could end the war with separatists that has killed more than 13,000 people.\n\nTo bring an end to the carnage, Zelensky needs strong international support. He hopes to strike a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin with backing from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron at a so-called Normandy Four meeting later this month.\n\nRussia and Ukraine recently swapped prisoners, a positive sign, but Zelensky has offered no clues on possible concessions. He demands, as did his predecessor, that Russia return the annexed Crimean peninsula to Ukraine, a non-starter for Putin.\n\nThe Trump administration eventually released $390 million in military aid to Ukraine, $140 million more than the amount Kyiv had expected before the administration suspended the funds for \u201creview\u201d last month.\n\n\u201cFor now, we would like America to support us more, and not only with money but also with the newest weapons in our war against the aggressor, the Russian Federation,\u201d Geraschenko, the adviser to Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe want a status as NATO\u2019s special partner, allowing us to buy any weapons in the U.S., including the newest anti-aircraft rockets to defend our country in case Russia decides to attack from the air; our technology is more than 40 years old.\u201d\n\nZelensky\u2019s team is struggling to overcome war, poverty, and corruption. Clearly, the idea of helping politicians of foreign states win elections is not a part of his public agenda.\n\n\u201cThis is a very special stage in Ukraine\u2019s development: We have completely changed this year, our mentality has changed, we realize that the entire world is watching us right now,\u201d Roman Truba, head of the State Bureau of Investigations, said in an exclusive interview with The Daily Beast.\n\nTruba\u2019s agency neither investigated Biden\u2019s son nor Burisma Holding. There were no signs of illegality in Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine, he said. \u201cThe State Bureau of Investigations should be an independent institution. I wish we would become as highly qualified, equipped with all modern technologies, and professional as the FBI.\u201d", "description": "Ukraine officials see no indication Biden or his son broke their laws.
