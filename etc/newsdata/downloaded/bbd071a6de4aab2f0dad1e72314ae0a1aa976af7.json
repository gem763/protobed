They would still be second best, but not quite so distantly. Naturally, though, for 2020 Mercedes will try and address their more draggy car to lessen their deficit on the straights.\n\nIf Ferrari can cut out the numerous errors that have blighted them in 2018 and 2019 they can be genuine contenders. They have won three races this year but they have been in a position to win seven and in promising positions in others, too.\n\nThe difficulty is sustaining a challenge over the course of a season. They were so far off the front at the start of the year that Mercedes raced away with little worry. Under greater and more sustained pressure from Ferrari, cracks could start to appear.\n\nMcLaren are finally back(ish)\n\nIt's easy to say that F1 needs a strong McLaren team but no team deserves a place in the sport on past glories. Still, McLaren's demise from front-runners to back-of-the-field also-rans was painful to see.\n\nIn 2019 they have become the class of the midfield and will surely finish in the top four in the championship for the first time since 2012. After years of living in denial, blaming Honda for their woes and ignoring their own flaws, recent management restructuring and a change in attitude and approach has been extremely effective.\n\nA lot of credit also needs to go to their drivers. Carlos Sainz is having his finest season and has scored 76 points after 17 rounds, finishing in the top six seven times, twice more than Pierre Gasly, who spent the first 12 races in a Red Bull. Lando Norris has also impressed in his debut year but had little luck. He will surely get better. McLaren must be delighted to have such a brilliant - and young - driver pairing.", "description": "It's difficult not to have mixed feelings about the 2019 Formula One season.", "authors": ["Luke Slater"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/formula-1/2019/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000212906308-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqH8oGYaaASnJZUiuddQ1p_w4wRx7k9ixzqw8pl8JMpsM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
