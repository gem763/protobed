He agreed and at some point Dmitry gave Sergey the baby to hold.\n\nHe described Sergey as his best friend, and said he was his wife's cousin and godfather to his eldest son.\n\nInvestigators say that Sergey Fomin - who is being sought by police for taking part in the protests - took someone else's child as a way to get through police encirclement of the demonstrators.\n\nThe Khomskikh case has not received such public attention, and the details emerged much later.\n\nThe prosecutors argued that during a protest on 3 August the lives of their two young daughters had been endangered because they were \"in close proximity to a large number of aggressively-minded demonstrators\".\n\nThe couple denied this.", "description": "Prosecutors wanted to strip two couples who took their young children to protests of parental rights.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07l67yl.jpg"}
