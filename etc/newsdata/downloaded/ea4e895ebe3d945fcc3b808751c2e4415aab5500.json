No such directive had been given yet.\n\nHe had also written to the station's management to make the same demand on Tuesday.\n\nJonkers said while the police watchdog believed in the principle of innocent until proven guilty, it found such allegations \"extremely disconcerting\".\n\n\"We are mindful of the power relationships between police and [the] community and it would therefore make no sense to have him at the police station with such a cloud hanging over him.\"\n\nJonkers said this was not the first incident of this nature as there have been \"other misdemeanours by police officials for which some are serving jail terms\".\n\nThe Cape Times reported earlier this year that another Grassy Park officer had appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court for allegedly raping a shoplifting suspect in 2016 while she was in police custody.\n\nAccording to the publication, the man had been linked to the crime through DNA evidence.\n\n\"It is clear that the Grassy Park police service needs an urgent overhaul,\" Jonkers said.\n\n\"The CPF suggested some remedial measures, especially in terms of sector policing, and hopefully [it] will be taken seriously.\"\n\nNews24 asked provincial police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana if the police officer was still on duty and whether any internal disciplinary steps were taken.\n\nShe responded that the matter was still under investigation, both criminally and departmentally.", "description": "A Cape Town police officer who is out on bail after allegedly forcing a woman to perform a sexual act on him, should be suspended while the criminal investigation is under way, the local community policing forum says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7228/18dcf5a8de644451af1fe02b0410cbbf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
