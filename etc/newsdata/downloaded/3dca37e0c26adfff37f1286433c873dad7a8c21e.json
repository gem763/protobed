Trump and Xi Jinping could come to pass. But when Micron (NASDAQ: ) reported earnings Thursday September 26, it revealed disappointing guidance, sending the stock down in after-market trading.\n\nThe end-of-Q2-swoon Micron (NASDAQ: ) suffered wiped out all of its gains for the year, but in the time since, the stock has been on the comeback trail. Even factoring in losses Thursday post-session, shares are up nearly 20% in 2019. Job postings for Micron hit their peak in late 2018, after the trade war was already in full swing. But it reduced postings, nearly 50%, before a big spike earlier this month.\n\nShortly before Micron (NASDAQ: ) decided to increase China job postings, it drastically cut listings in neighboring Taiwan, reducing them by more than 60%. Earlier this year we covered Micron's move to reduce job postings in China - certainly not unique, as the US-China trade war has ratcheted up rhetoric from leaders around the world. But the return to China, is notable - just as much as the proportional decline in job postings in Taiwan preceded Micron's likely change of heart.\n\nAlready, concern is creeping up in markets that the tech sector could be hurt should the US-China trade war linger for longer. Some tech companies have stalled - or reversed - job posting plans and expansion efforts in China.\n\nAnd while very few tech companies have reversed course and begun hiring more in China, as Micron (NASDAQ: ) appears to have done, it is equally noteworthy that Micron's exposure to the Chinese marketplace is perceived to be larger than most Silicon Valley firms, at least among Wall Street analysts.\n\nWhat remains unclear is what motivated the spike in job postings; was it greed, or was it need?\n\nAbout the Data: Thinknum tracks companies using information they post online - jobs, social and web traffic, product sales and app ratings - and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Thinknum covering: Micron Technology Inc.
