But Philip Guyett, a former \"body broker\" \u2014 who for six years collected dead bodies from funeral homes, recovered body parts for transplant, and sold them to third parties \u2014 offered a surprising theory.\n\nFBI agents raiding BRC in 2014. CBS 15 via Arizona Attorney General/YouTube\n\nMany families who can't afford to cremate their relatives donate various body parts to body-donation centers \u2014 like the one Guyett ran, or BRC \u2014 in exchange for their cremation and the subsequent return of the ashes.\n\nThe only body parts that turn into ash are a person's bones. So the Arizona center might have taken away too many of a dead person's bones, and was trying to sew together different people's parts to make up a full body's worth of ashes, Guyett told Business Insider.\n\nHere's his theory:\n\n\"If I knew that a family wanted their ashes back, I'd be doing limited recovery [of internal organs or tissues] so that they would get 90% of that bone ash back.\n\n\"[But] these other people, they take everything. They'll take the arms, the shoulders, the spine, the hip, and basically all the family would be left with is maybe a cup's worth of ashes from a leftover rib cage or something.\n\n\"So I think the family wanted the ashes back, and [the Biological Resource Center] took some body parts that they didn't have to get back, just to make up the volume.\n\n\"That would be my assumption because there's no other reason to go through that work of trying to put the body parts back together again.\"\n\n\"It's not normal,\" he added.\n\nPhilip Guyett with a cutout of former President Barack Obama. Courtesy of Philip Guyett\n\nGuyett told Business Insider that his business was entirely legal, and that relatives had explicitly given permission for him to take parts of their loved ones' bodies for research.\n\nHis clients included private universities and researchers that needed specific body parts for their teaching exercises. They would require various body parts \u2014 from brains to skin grafts to various tissues \u2014 to test out new medical technologies, and carry out research of the human body for science.\n\nWhile his business as a whole was legal, in 2009 Guyett was sentenced to eight years in federal prison for falsifying the medical records of some cadavers that he wanted to sell for transplant.\n\nHe served six-and-a-half years, during which time he wrote a book about his experiences \u2014 titled \"Head Shoulders Knees & Bone$.\"\n\n\"I don't regret being in the business,\" Guyett, who now works as a land surveyor in Southern California, told Business Insider. \"I regret some of the things I did, obviously, but the business was interesting. And I think life should be interesting.\"\n\nSingle cadavers are generally used for several purposes\n\nOne cadaver is typically cut up into various body parts, which would then be sold onto a range of buyers \u2014 including the US Army.\n\nOne man in Arizona is currently suing BRC after finding out that his mother's body, which he donated in hopes that it could be sent for Alzheimer's research, had been sold to the US Army to test the effects of roadside bombs on troops.\n\nThe Army said when the case was first reported that it was unaware the family had not given consent for such testing.\n\nRead more: An Arizona man is suing a body-donation company after it gave his mother's corpse to the military for blast testing\n\nBRC sold Doris Stauffer's body to the US Army for bomb testing.
