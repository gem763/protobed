The 19 Labour MPs who believed Boris Johnson cared about workers rights have no excuses after Tory plans confirmed how, outside the EU, he\u2019d cut them.\n\nBrexit\u2019s a class issue when the working class picks up the bill.", "description": "Boris Johnson faces a hat-trick of defeats when attempting once again to trigger the 'Grinch' election on December 12", "authors": ["Kevin Maguire", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20735595.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
