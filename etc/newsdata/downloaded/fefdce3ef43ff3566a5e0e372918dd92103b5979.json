I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Bolton has disagreed with the president on several foreign policy issues\u2014including, most recently, the president\u2019s interest in meeting with Taliban leaders at Camp David to negotiate a possible peace deal in Afghanistan.\n\nIn his own Twitter message, Mr. Bolton offered a conflicting account of his departure, saying: \u201cI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about it tomorrow.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s offer to resign came during a contentious conversation with Mr. Trump about Afghanistan on Monday before the president left for a campaign rally in North Carolina, according to a person familiar with the conversation.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What do you think of the reasons for President Trump to fire John Bolton as national security adviser? Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Trump grew frustrated that Mr. Bolton continued to oppose the president\u2019s plan to strike a peace deal with the Taliban and the Afghan government. Mr. Bolton has supported drawing down troops in Afghanistan.\n\nEarly Tuesday, Mr. Bolton sent a letter of resignation to the White House, this person said.\n\nFew at the White House expected the resignation. Mr. Bolton was scheduled to brief White House reporters Tuesday afternoon, along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. White House press officials sent a news release about the joint briefing about an hour before Mr. Trump posted on Twitter about his national security adviser\u2019s departure.\n\nCharles Kupperman, the deputy national security adviser, has been named Mr. Bolton\u2019s temporary replacement, a White House spokeswoman said.\n\nNames being discussed by those close to Mr. Trump as potential full-time replacements included Rob Blair, a senior White House official who has been a national security adviser for acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and Ric Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany. Neither immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nA White House spokeswoman declined to comment on a potential successor, who would be Mr. Trump\u2019s fourth national security adviser in three years.\n\nIn their previously scheduled White House press briefing about terrorism-related sanctions\u2014now minus Mr. Bolton\u2014Messrs. Mnuchin and Pompeo deflected questions about the specific drivers of Mr. Bolton\u2019s departure, while saying that foreign leaders shouldn\u2019t take his exit as signaling a shift in U.S. policy.\n\nMr. Mnuchin noted that Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolton disagreed on the Iraq War, and Mr. Pompeo acknowledged that he often disagreed with Mr. Bolton on policy as well. Asked if he was surprised by Mr. Bolton\u2019s departure, given that Tuesday morning\u2019s public schedule had him attending the briefing, Mr. Pompeo responded: \u201cI\u2019m never surprised.\u201d\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton watching as President Trump meets with South Korean President Moon Jae-In in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on May 22, 2018.

That\u2019s the most ridiculous question I\u2019ve ever heard of.\u201d\n\nThe decision to part ways appeared to be as much about competing personalities and questions about loyalty as it was about opposing viewpoints on the direction of foreign policy.\n\nMessrs. Trump and Bolton had a professional relationship but \u201cnot a personal one,\u201d one person said. The two didn\u2019t have the level of chemistry that Mr. Trump has with Mr. Pompeo, for example, the person added.\n\nThere also has been tension between Messers. Bolton and Pompeo, but it had grown worse in recent weeks, according to one person familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, Mr. Blair\u2019s role at the White House has been growing in recent weeks under Mr. Mulvaney.\n\nMr. Blair increasingly has been taking the lead on national security matters at the White House. \u201cHe\u2019s in every meeting with the president. Bolton isn\u2019t,\u201d said another person familiar with the matter.\n\nMr. Bolton, 70, took over as national security adviser on April 9, 2018, about a week before the U.S., France and the United Kingdom carried out a series of military strikes in Syria.\n\nHe scored key policy victories during his White House tenure, such as overseeing Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, reached under former President Obama, and scaling back American support for the United Nations.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, national security adviser John Bolton and Vice President Mike Pence, left to right, looking on as President Trump said the U.S. intends to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement at the White House in Washington on May 8, 2018.

Ms. Ricardel subsequently left the National Security Council.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2014a former ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush who also served in the administrations of Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush\u2014has been an influential force in conservative politics. He endorses dozens of candidates every election year, sending them money directly through his political committee and making independent expenditures promoting them through his super PAC.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, Mike Flynn, was forced out after 24 days amid questions about contacts with Russian officials, and he subsequently pleaded guilty to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The next adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, stepped aside after criticism that he wasn\u2019t pursuing Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda vigorously enough.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s abrupt ouster spurred strong reaction on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers have long split on the contentious policy adviser.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very very unhappy to hear that he\u2019s leaving,\u201d said Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah). \u201cIt is a huge loss in my opinion for the administration and for the nation to no longer have John Bolton at the table on matters of foreign policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis experience in foreign policy, his point of view, wasn\u2019t the same as everyone else in the room. That\u2019s why you wanted him there,\u201d Mr. Romney said. \u201cThe fact that he was a contrarian from time to time was an asset, not a liability.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.), who has a long history of opposing U.S. military intervention overseas, applauded the decision.\n\n\u201cThe chances for war worldwide go down exponentially with him out of the White House,\u201d Mr. Paul said.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii) said, \u201cI think it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, (R., S.C.), a supporter of Mr. Bolton, said the national security adviser wasn\u2019t working out for Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that the relationship had soured,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cI hope he\u2019ll pick a national security adviser that he has confidence in, but I appreciate John Bolton and I think he sees the world as a dangerous place.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham said he didn\u2019t know the end was coming for Mr. Bolton, but he had heard it might be related to the controversy over inviting the Taliban to Camp David.\n\n\u201cI knew there were some concerns about the Taliban meeting but I didn\u2019t know for sure,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cHe gave the president his honest opinion and it\u2019s time for him to move on.\u201d\n\n\u2014Lindsay Wise, Natalie Andrews and Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Michael C.
