USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Pedro Martinez\u2019s call to the Hall of Fame came in 2015, laying the groundwork for another, less renowned bit of enshrinement likely to come his way.\n\nAlong the fa\u00e7ade at Nationals Park is a blue-lettered nod to the franchise\u2019s fun and fickle and occasionally glorious past in Montreal, where former Expos Gary Carter, Andre Dawson and Tim Raines are honored for their meritorious contributions to another red, white and blue squad uprooted by Major League Baseball to Washington in 2005.\n\nThe Expos are defunct, and while baseball in Montreal isn\u2019t dead, it certainly resides in purgatory, dependent on the whims of MLB\u2019s expansion desires and a revenue-hungry owner in Tampa Bay willing to claim dual-citizenship for his franchise.\n\nWORLD SERIES: Astros get their swagger back in Game 4 win\n\nNATIONALS: Can Washington recover from its two losses?\n\nFor Martinez, now 48 and the only Cy Young Award winner in Montreal Expos history, the Nationals\u2019 first World Series in franchise history instills him with both pride and hope for the game\u2019s future in Quebec.\n\n\u201cWhen I see \u2018Nationals,\u2019 I can\u2019t help but think, \u2018Expos,\u2019\u201d Martinez, now a MLB Network and TBS analyst, told USA TODAY Sports before Saturday\u2019s Game 4. \u201cAnd I know this is Washington and this will probably never go away, particularly with all the things they\u2019re doing here, but at the same time, I think Montreal deserves another crack at seeing a World Series.\n\n\u201cAnd I know most of the Montreal fans are rooting for the Nationals to do it, because they feel that somehow, this is their franchise. I actually feel bad for Montreal because when I won it in \u201904 with Boston my first thought was, \u2018Where are the people in Montreal?\u2019\n\n\u201cWe were so close. We were going to be the franchise to beat for the next few years and it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nMartinez with the Expos in 1997. (Photo: Russell Beeker, Baseball Weekly)\n\nMartinez speaks of the 1994 squad, his first in Montreal after a fateful trade from the Los Angeles Dodgers for second baseman Delino DeShields, and a year that ended in August with the Expos a staggering 74-40 and six games clear of the field in the National League East.\n\nBut the players\u2019 strike that followed waylaid both the Expos\u2019 title hopes and baseball\u2019s future in the city, aided and abetted by neglect from ownership and the team\u2019s status as an orphan under MLB\u2019s rule.\n\n\"We all had broken hearts because we didn't get the chance.\" @45PedroMartinez looks back at the 1994 Expos. #MLBTonightpic.twitter.com/K8w8JD5SvT \u2014 MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) October 27, 2019\n\nMartinez\u2019s 1997 trade to the Boston Red Sox accelerated the malaise, and though he became a World Series champion and eventual Hall of Famer in Boston, the deal created significant trepidation.\n\n\u201cI was not aware of the entire history in Boston,\u201d he says. \u201cI did not expect to be exposed at that moment to so much history, so much adversity for the Boston franchise.\n\n\u201cAnd now, I don\u2019t regret it one bit. But at first, I wanted to be in a contending team that was going to give a chance like I had with Montreal in the \u201994 season.\u201d\n\nThat chance never came for the Expos, who are rarely remembered in D.C. The Nationals had a celebration honoring the 50th anniversary of the Montreal franchise in July, but it was the first time the team had ever worn Expos throwback uniforms.\n\nNationals players, wearing Expos throwback uniforms, sit in the dugout with Vladimir Guerrero on July 6. (Photo: Evan Habeeb, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nMartinez will be more than happy to return and add his name alongside Carter and Raines and Dawson. He doesn\u2019t expect many more nods to Montreal with what remains in the franchise.\n\nYet he certainly believes it wouldn\u2019t be bad for business.\n\n\u201cIf they do it, they do it. If not, I have Montreal in my heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not their duty to (promote Montreal), because the closest thing to a Montreal Expo is (original Nationals draftee) Ryan Zimmerman. But at the same time, I must say, there\u2019s a connection. And we are so close to Montreal from here.\n\n\u201cAnd they should make a balance, of the fact that a lot of Montrealers feel they can come to Washington and root for the home team. So they probably should be promoting a little bit more the fan base in Montreal and try to seduce them to come over and be part of this franchise.\u201d", "description": "The Hall of Fame pitcher played four seasons with Montreal, winning the NL Cy Young award in 1997.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published A.M.
