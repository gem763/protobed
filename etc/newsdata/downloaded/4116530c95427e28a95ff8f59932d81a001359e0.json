The path is secluded and also crosses over a busy road. I think it is dangerous to ask a child to walk that far by themselves.'\n\nA spokeswoman for Rhondda Cynon Taf council said: 'Free school transport is given to pupils living more than two miles from their nearest or catchment school a generous provision in comparison to Welsh Government's statutory provision for this age group, which stands at three miles.\n\n'The council uses consistent criteria to determine eligibility, measured by the shortest safe walking distance - while additional factors are also considered such as whether it is safe for the pupil to walk along or accompanied by an appropriate adult.\n\nIn the morning the youngster has to catch a lift with parents who drop him into school on their way to work. But once the school bell has rung for the end of the day, Mrs Griffiths said her son has no choice but to walk the 2.1 mile journey back to their front door\n\n'The pupil from Abernant has been assessed as living 1.972 miles from the catchment faith school and is therefore not eligible for school transport.\n\n'The walking route from Abernant to St John Baptist Church in Wales High School is long established and in daily use, in accordance with the Learler Travel (Wales) Measure 2008.\n\n'Inevitably, there are some pupils who fall just outside the two-mile entitlement limit, but the council must be consistent in its provision for all pupils.\n\n'The council calculates route measurements using Government-standard Ordnance Survey data, accurate to 1m and generally accepted as the most accurate available.\n\nThe use of alternative methods of measurement for different children from various addresses would not be appropriate, as it would be less accurate and create inequality between families.\n\n'Parents are offered the possibility of purchasing spare seats on our school transport, but it is a discretionary provision subject to seat availability.'", "description": "Hudson Griffiths, 11, was denied a free bus pass because his front door is just a few yards too close to school, leaving his mother Kiri, 31, enraged that her young son has to walk that far in the winter.", "authors": ["Rod Ardehali For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/12/19880258-0-image-a-6_1571396428670.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
