(NYSE: QUAD) (\u201cQuad\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) today reported results for its third quarter ending September 30, 2019.\n\nKey Actions to Accelerate Transformation\n\nPlans to divest book business that generates annual sales of $200 million as part of ongoing portfolio optimization.\n\nExpands cost reduction program to $50 million in annual savings.\n\nResets quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share to provide additional financial flexibility to continue to scale its Quad 3.0 strategy and maintain a strong long-term balance sheet.\n\n\u201cWe are making bold decisions to accelerate our transformation through investments in our business that will drive long-term growth and shareholder value, and provide us with the ability to take advantage of opportunities in the rapidly changing print industry,\u201d said Joel Quadracci, Chairman, President & CEO. \u201cOur Quad 3.0 transformation strategy is working as evidenced by $125 million of expected organic incremental sales growth in 2019, which helps offset over three percentage points of annual print sales decline. Our Quad 3.0 strategy is centered on our unique integrated marketing solutions platform that includes customer analytics, campaign strategies, media optimization and global production. These integrated services, supported by an industry-leading manufacturing platform, help clients drive growth by reducing complexity, enhancing efficiencies and improving marketing spend effectiveness across all channels.\u201d\n\nQuadracci continued: \u201cWe have made the strategic decision to divest our book business, which follows our recent sale of our non-core industrial wood crating business, Transpak. We will continue to optimize our product portfolio for the long-term to advance our Quad 3.0 transformation strategy. We\u2019ve also made the decision to further streamline costs through our $50 million cost reduction program and proactively reset the dividend to provide additional financial flexibility for growth-focused opportunities that address our clients\u2019 evolving needs and to maintain a strong balance sheet over the long term.\u201d\n\nSummary Results\n\nResults for the three months ended September 30, 2019, included:\n\nNet Sales (excluding discontinued operations) \u2014 Net sales were $944 million in 2019 as compared to $974 million in 2018, down 3.1%. Organic sales declined 4.3% during the quarter, after excluding sales related to the January 2019 acquisition of Periscope.

Adjusted EBITDA (excluding discontinued operations) \u2014 Adjusted EBITDA was $80 million in 2019, as compared to $107 million in 2018, and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.4% in 2019, as compared to 11.0% in 2018. The variance to prior year primarily reflects $8 million of strategic investments made to increase hourly production employees\u2019 wages, $8 million from the reduction in market price for paper byproduct recoveries, and the impact from the organic sales decline of 4.3%.\n\nResults for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, included:\n\nNet Sales (excluding discontinued operations) \u2014 Net sales were $2.9 billion in both 2019 and 2018.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities \u2014 Net cash provided by operating activities was $4 million in 2019, as compared to $47 million in 2018, primarily due a $45 million reverse termination fee paid to LSC Communications during the third quarter 2019 and lower net earnings, partially offset by an improvement in cash provided from working capital.\n\n\u2014 Net cash provided by operating activities was $4 million in 2019, as compared to $47 million in 2018, primarily due a $45 million reverse termination fee paid to LSC Communications during the third quarter 2019 and lower net earnings, partially offset by an improvement in cash provided from working capital. Free Cash Flow \u2014 Free Cash Flow, after excluding $60 million in LSC-related payments, was negative $35 million in 2019, as compared to negative $38 million in 2018, primarily due to an improvement in cash provided from working capital, partially offset by lower net earnings and increased capital expenditures on long-term investments in automation and productivity improvements in the manufacturing platform. As a reminder, the Company generates the majority of its Free Cash Flow in the fourth quarter of the year.\n\nDividend\n\nAs part of the Company\u2019s commitment to effective capital allocation, and to provide ample resources and additional financial flexibility to drive Quad\u2019s continued transformation, the Company made the proactive decision to reset its dividend policy. Quad\u2019s next quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share will be payable on December 6, 2019, to shareholders of record as of November 18, 2019.\n\nGuidance\n\nThe Company is updating its full-year 2019 guidance to exclude the discontinued operations of the book business and to reflect updated business trends from weakening market prices for paper byproduct recoveries, and the timing of productivity improvements from wage increases. Updated guidance is as follows:\n\nU.S. $ Previous 2019 Guidance Range Updated 2019 Guidance Range Excluding Discontinued Operations Net Sales $4.05 billion to $4.25 billion Approximately $3.9 billion Adjusted EBITDA $360 million to $400 million $300 million to $330 million Free Cash Flow $145 million to $185 million $80 million to $100 million*\n\n*Free Cash Flow excludes $60 million in LSC-related payments and includes cash flows from discontinued operations.\n\nQuarterly Conference Call\n\nQuad (NYSE: QUAD) will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. EST on Wednesday, October 30, to discuss third quarter and year-to-date 2019 results.

Forward-looking statements include statements regarding, among other things, our current expectations about the Company\u2019s future results, financial condition, sales, earnings, free cash flow, margins, objectives, goals, strategies, beliefs, intentions, plans, estimates, prospects, projections and outlook of the Company and can generally be identified by the use of words or phrases such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cforesee,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201ccontinue\u201d or the negatives of these terms, variations on them and other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based largely on the Company\u2019s expectations and judgments and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are unforeseeable and beyond our control.\n\nThe factors that could cause actual results to materially differ include, among others: the impact of decreasing demand for printed materials and significant overcapacity in the highly competitive environment creates downward pricing pressures and potential underutilization of assets; the impact of digital media and similar technological changes, including digital substitution by consumers; the impact of fluctuations in costs (including labor and labor- related costs, energy costs, freight rates and raw materials) and the impact of fluctuations in the availability of raw materials; the failure to successfully identify, manage, complete and integrate acquisitions and investments; the inability of the Company to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency rapidly enough to meet market conditions; the impact of increased business complexity as a result of the Company\u2019s transformation into a marketing solutions partner; the impact of regulatory matters and legislative developments or changes in laws, including changes in cyber-security, privacy and environmental laws; the impact of changing future economic conditions; the failure of clients to perform under contracts or to renew contracts with clients on favorable terms or at all; the failure to attract and retain qualified talent across the enterprise; significant capital expenditures may be needed to maintain the Company\u2019s platforms and processes and to remain technologically and economically competitive; the impact of changes in postal rates, service levels or regulations; the fragility and decline in overall distribution channels, including newspaper distribution channels; the impact of the various restrictive covenants in the Company\u2019s debt facilities on the Company\u2019s ability to operate its business; the impact of risks associated with the operations outside of the United States, including costs incurred or reputational damage suffered due to improper conduct of its employees, contractors or agents; the impact on the holders of Quad\u2019s class A common stock of a limited active market for such shares and the inability to independently elect directors or control decisions due to the voting power of the class B common stock; the impact of an other than temporary decline in operating results and enterprise value that could lead to non-cash impairment charges due to the impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; the impact of divestitures or discontinued operations; and the other risk factors identified in the Company\u2019s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which may be amended or supplemented by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nExcept to the extent required by the federal securities laws, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release contains financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (referred to as Non-GAAP), specifically Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, Debt Leverage Ratio and Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net earnings (loss) attributable to Quad common shareholders excluding interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges, (loss) earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, net pension income, employee stock ownership plan contributions, loss (gain) on debt extinguishment, equity in (earnings) loss of unconsolidated entity, the Adjusted EBITDA for unconsolidated equity method investments (calculated in a consistent manner with the calculation for Quad) and net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, plus LSC-related payments primarily related to incremental interest payments associated with the 2019 amended debt refinancing and transaction-related costs. Debt Leverage Ratio is defined as total debt and finance lease obligations divided by the last twelve months of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share is defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in (earnings) loss of unconsolidated entity excluding restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges, employee stock ownership plan contributions, loss (gain) on debt extinguishment, and adjusted for income tax expense at a normalized tax rate, divided by diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding.\n\nThe Company believes that these Non-GAAP measures, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, provide additional information for evaluating Quad\u2019s performance and are important measures by which Quad\u2019s management assesses the profitability and liquidity of its business. These Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. These Non-GAAP measures may be different than Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these Non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.\n\nAbout Quad\n\nQuad (NYSE: QUAD) is a worldwide marketing solutions partner dedicated to creating a better way for its clients through a data-driven, integrated marketing platform that helps clients reduce complexity, increase efficiency and enhance marketing spend effectiveness.

Adjusted EBITDA for Periscope was calculated in a consistent manner with the calculation above for Quad. Periscope\u2019s financial information has been consolidated within Quad\u2019s financial results since the date of acquisition.

Ivie\u2019s financial information has been consolidated within Quad\u2019s financial results since the date of acquisition. If the two months of pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for Ivie was not included in the calculation, the Company\u2019s Debt Leverage Ratio would have been 2.19x as of December 31, 2018. (4) The Company had $18 million and $70 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. Based on the Company\u2019s typical year-end cash balance of approximately $10 million, Quad had $8 million and $60 million of excess cash at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively.
