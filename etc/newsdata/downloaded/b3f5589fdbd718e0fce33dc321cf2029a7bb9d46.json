Here are all the major talking points and social media reaction from the fourth live show\u2026\n\nKarim bounced back and even eclipsed Kelvin\n\nFor most of Saturday's show, it looked like Kelvin Fletcher was set to top the scoreboard for the third time in five weeks. The former Emmerdale actor was this year's first male celebrity to tackle the notoriously tricky rumba and his highly masculine yet sizzlingly sensual routine sent the judges all aflutter. Indeed, a couple of them could barely speak.\n\nKelvin was sitting pretty at the top of the standings until the very last dance, from CBeebies presenter Karim Zeroual. He\u2019s been struck down with flu this week - pro partner Amy Dowden was sneezing, croaking and seemed to be succumbing too - but you wouldn't know it from his fierce tango.\n\nHe led strongly and was full of sharp staccato, strong posture and stalking attack, duly notching two perfect 10s in a total of 38 points - the joint highest score of the series so far. Karim was keen to bounce back into the leading pack after last week\u2019s misfiring Movie Week samba and boy, did he do it in style.\n\nThe two Ks, Karim and Kelvin, already look like they could be slugging it out for the glitterball trophy in two months' time.
