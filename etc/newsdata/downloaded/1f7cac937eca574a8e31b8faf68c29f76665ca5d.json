We've seen the devastating impact, they need to be banned. And that means, by definition, you don't leave millions and millions of them out there. The buyback is the obvious approach,\" he said, adding that pushback from gun owners would be \"something we have to resolve going forward.\"\n\n\"Under the Second Amendment, there are going to be plenty of appropriate weapons that people can use for self-defense for hunting, if they're sportsmen, if they're marksmen ... but the military-grade assault weapons -- those just don't belong in the hands of everyday people.\"", "description": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he plans to stay in the 2020 Democratic presidential race with the goal of making\u00a0the October debate stage.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Carlson-deBlasio_FOX.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
