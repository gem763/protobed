He actually made it up. It should be criminal. It should be treasonous. He made it up, every word of it, and read to Congress as if I said it. And I'll tell you what, he should be forced to resign from Congress. Adam Schiff, he's a low life. He should be forced to resign,\" Trump said. \"He took that conversation, which was perfect, he said, 'I can't read this,' so he made up a conversation and he reported it and said it to Congress and the American people.\"\n\n\"It was horrible what he said,\" he continued. \"It was all fabricated. He should resign from office in disgrace and frankly they should look at him for treason because he is making up the words of the President of the United States. Not only words, but the meaning.\"\n\nPresident Trump is referring to Schiff's decision last week to enter false testimony and fraudulent statements into the congressional record.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Times is out with a new story exposing Schiff and his role in orchestrating the whistleblower complaint.\n\n\u201cSchiff, House Intel Chairman, Got Early Account of Whistle-Blower\u2019s Accusations\u201d\n\n\n\nSCHIFF IS A FRAUD! https://t.co/BNXiq5dsXg pic.twitter.com/PHdh8PBTGb \u2014 Donald J.
