Luckily, I've got so many things happening in my life to distract me from the fact I'm incredibly sad.\n\n'I used meds to get me out of bed and dry my tears': Emily Atack has broken her silence on her split from Rob Jowers and her battle with depression\n\n'But I know the drill and I've got over boys before.
