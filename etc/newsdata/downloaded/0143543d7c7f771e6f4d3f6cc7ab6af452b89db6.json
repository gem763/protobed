The 78-year-old was asked how he could \u201creassure\u201d Americans that he was up for the task.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I\u2019m going to reassure the American people,\u201d Sanders said while thanking voters, friends and fellow Democratic primary candidates for their support. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to be back here with you this evening.\u201d\n\nNext came Biden\u2014whose age has been a topic of conversation and criticism over the past several months on the campaign trail. CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett quoted former President Jimmy Carter, who said that he wouldn\u2019t have been able to start a presidential term at the age of 80, and pressed Biden why he thinks he could handle the pressure.\n\n\u201cBecause I watched it, I know what the job is, I\u2019ve been engaged,\u201d Biden, 76, said, adding that \u201cone of the reasons\u201d he is running for president is his age\u2014and with that, comes \u201cwisdom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need someone in office this time around who on day one, on the world stage, can command respect from world leaders and know exactly what needs to be done to get this country back on track,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why I decided to run this time because I know what has to be done. I\u2019ve done it before, I\u2019ve been there.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI will not need any on the job training.\u201d\n\nBiden, who has grappled with sustained critical media coverage of a string of gaffes on the campaign trail, then vowed to release his health records, along with his tax records, before the Iowa Caucuses in January\u2014the first contest of the 2020 primary season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only guy who\u2019s released anything up here,\u201d he scoffed.\n\nWarren, D-Mass., who is 70, brushed off her age, when asked to respond.\n\n\u201cI say I will outwork, out-organize, and outlast anyone and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump, who is 73, has said he feels \u201cyoung\u201d and is ready for another term of his administration.\n\n\u201cI feel like a young man. I am a young, vibrant man,\u201d Trump said in April.\n\nShould Trump be re-elected, he would be 74 on Jan. 20, 2021\u2014Inauguration Day. Should the presidency go to one of the elder Democrats in the field\u2014Biden would be 78; Sanders would be 79; and Warren would be 71.\n\nBut the CNN and New York Times moderators shifted to the other end of the spectrum, pointing to Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, for her young age of 38.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to ask these three about their health and their wellness,\u201d she said of the questions to Biden, Sanders and Warren. \u201cWho is fit to serve as commander-in-chief?\u201d\n\nGabbard said that she was, and further challenged the moderators to ask every candidate on the stage about their age and health\u2014a suggestion that was ignored.", "description": "The top three Democratic candidates were put on defense during Tuesday night\u2019s debate, with Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders all facing pointed questions about their age, health and how those factors could affect their electability and potential presidency.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
