The vessel is owned by Vulcan Inc, a company created by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.\n\nThe crew deployed an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) fitted with sonar, which helped to pinpoint the locations of the Kaga and Akagi. The Petrel also worked with the US Navy, as it is otherwise illegal to disturb underwater sites where the wrecks of US military ships lie.\n\nBoth ships were found lying about 18,000 feet (5,490 metres) under water within the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument - the largest marine conservation area in the world.\n\nMidway Atoll, a small group of islands in the North Pacific, was used as a US military installation during the war.\n\nJapan had planned to capture the islands, but the US intercepted its communications. When Japanese troops arrived at the islands on 4 June 1942, ready to strike, they found the Americans waiting to meet them.\n\nMore than 2,000 Japanese people and 300 Americans were killed in the battle that ensued. A total of seven ships were sunk - four of which were Japanese.", "description": "Both ships were sunk during the Battle of Midway, fought between Japan and the US in 1942.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F9A7/production/_109311936_gettyimages-615318078.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
