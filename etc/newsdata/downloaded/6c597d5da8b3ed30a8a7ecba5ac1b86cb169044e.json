According to university officials, the students involved are protected by their First Amendment rights.\n\nThe photo, captioned \"Wakanda forevaa,\" a reference to Marvel's \u201cBlack Panther\u201d film, was initially shared on Instagram last weekend and received almost immediate criticism and calls for Colorado State University to punish the four students.\n\n\"I go to CSU and to be honest, it's not surprising at all,\" a man, who said he was a student, commented on Denver community organizer and Denver School Board candidate Tay Anderson's Facebook post.\n\n\"Disgusting and absolutely unacceptable,\" another person commented. \"There is no explanation for such a blatant hate crime against humanity.\"\n\nOne commenter added that the photo appears to be taken on school property and that she is \"pretty certain there's something about this behavior in the handbook.\"\n\nHowever, according to university officials, the photo did not technically violate any rules, and they are unable to punish the students.\n\n\"We have heard from many of you \u2014 and we hear you,\" CSU president Joyce McConnell wrote in a statement released on Tuesday. \"We know that images like this one \u2014 whether consciously racist or not \u2014 can perpetuate deliberate racism and create a climate that feels deeply hostile.\"\n\nWhile university officials admit that the photo of the students, whose names have not been released, \"runs counter to our principles of community,\" they do not consider it a violation of any CSU rule or regulation. Furthermore, the university states that students, faculty and staff are permitted to post \"whatever they wish\" on their personal online accounts.\n\n\"The First Amendment prohibits the university from taking any punitive action against those in the photo,\" the statement read.\n\nBoth students and alumni spoke up regarding university officials' decision.\n\nCSU students post themselves in blackface, and the president of the university sends and email to students saying people can post whatever they want to post. Once again, CSU disappoints me. \u2014 Shaylur\u2122 (@Shaylur1) September 11, 2019\n\nSome students who go to CSU posted pictures on Instagram in blackface. This is extremely embarrassing, and I am ashamed that they go to our school. To put the cherry on top the school can\u2019t even punish them. Gross. \u2014 Graeme Schroeder (@grvyschrodinger) September 11, 2019\n\nCSU proudly has shown us another example of what WHITE PRIVILEGE looks like in America. A group of white students had black faces, and posted it . And they\u2019re condoning the behavior when it\u2019s effecting and inflicting serious issues for the students of color. \u2014 Eugene Rivers III (@GENEHERBO) September 11, 2019\n\nSo some students at CSU posted a picture, essentially in Blackface, and the new president basically said \u201cyea that\u2019s not cool but it\u2019s cool cause they can post whatever they want\u201d. Outrageously disappointed as an alum. \u2014 toni. (@toninianne) September 11, 2019\n\nCSU needs a president who is actually gonna deal with these problems and let it known it's not okay on our campus pic.twitter.com/3dZVt4pWAw \u2014 Seth \ud83c\udf30 (@SethChesnut2) September 12, 2019\n\n\"CSU is an educational institution committed to respecting every member of our community and to facilitating discussions that can promote honesty, learning, and healing,\" the statement continued. \"We are all here at CSU to learn, and we believe that this can be a powerful learning moment that leads to healing and reconciliation. We urge every member of our community to listen, and to hear, all the voices that make up this wonderful, diverse campus family so we can move forward together, stronger than ever.\"\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Four Colorado State University students, who wore blackface in a photo, will not face punishment.
