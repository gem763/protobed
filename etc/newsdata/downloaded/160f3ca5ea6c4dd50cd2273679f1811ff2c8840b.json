On Wednesday they won\u2019t even be able to play there\n\nDome Torrent started thinking about how to acclimatise his New York City FC players to the unusual surroundings of Citi Field weeks ago. It became clear earlier this month that the New York Yankees\u2019 playoff run would likely push NYC FC out of the teams\u2019 shared home, Yankee Stadium, for at least one of the MLS Eastern conference semi-finals and final. Torrent, like the club itself, quickly drew up a contingency plan to mitigate any impact a temporary move seven miles away to Queens could have on his side. Practice sessions at Citi Field \u2013 the home of MLB\u2019s New York Mets \u2013 were pencilled in early.\n\nAs things panned out, the Houston Astros\u2019 win on Saturday night saw the Yankees miss out on a place in the World Series, but a rain delay earlier in the series meant NYC FC\u2019s contingency plan had to be activated regardless. Indeed, New York City FC will face Toronto FC at Citi Field on Wednesday. The club\u2019s most important game of the season so far will be at a venue they have only ever played at once before and there\u2019s no guarantee Yankee Stadium will be free for a potential MLS Cup final either, with a college football game set to be played there the day before. Such uncertainty at the most critical point of the campaign shone a light on NYC FC\u2019s current situation. This is their fifth season in MLS and they still don\u2019t have a stadium of their own.\n\nOf course, NYC FC aren\u2019t the only MLS franchise to share a stadium. Far from it. Atlanta United, the Seattle Sounders, the New England Revolution, the Vancouver Whitecaps and many others share with another team. That NYC FC are squatters in the home of another sporting franchise is not the primary issue.\n\nThe primary issue is that Yankee Stadium is a baseball venue. There are a number of NFL stadiums in use across MLS, but Yankee Stadium is the only baseball stadium hosting top-flight soccer in North America. While NFL and soccer teams make for decent bedfellows \u2013 both are played on a rectangle \u2013 the same can\u2019t necessarily be said of the relationship between NYC FC and the Yankees. Their relationship is one of necessity rather than convenience.\n\nMLS playoff predictions: Zlatan Ibrahimovic stands between LAFC and glory Read more\n\nIndeed, there is an undeniable awkwardness to the way a soccer pitch is squeezed into Yankee Stadium. Opposition players and coaches have complained about the dimensions, the smallest permitted by Fifa (70 yards x 110 yards). Some doubt that it is even that big, with Sporting KC head coach Peter Vermes claiming four years ago that he\u2019d measured it at 68 yards x 106 yards.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest NYC FC will play Wednesday\u2019s game in another baseball venue, this time the New York Mets\u2019 Citi Field. Photograph: John Minchillo/AP\n\nYankee Stadium isn\u2019t the most natural soccer venue for supporters either. NYC FC told the Guardian that many fans are happy with the stadium arrangements, although none of the supporters we spoke to reflected that view. \u201cThe sight lines where typically the best seats in the house would be, which are centre field, those are the worst seats in Yankee Stadium,\u201d explains Justin Bulova of NYC FC supporters group The Third Rail. The stadium is orientated towards home plate. The grandstands fan out from that apex because for a baseball game that is the focal point of everything. \u201cI\u2019ve sat there for a NYC FC match,\u201d Bulova continues, \u201cand you feel like you\u2019re half a stadium away from the field.\u201d\n\nBig name signings like Frank Lampard, Andrea Pirlo and David Villa, as well as the link with Manchester City, have made them a marquee franchise and so the image they present resonates. Yankee Stadium\u2019s improvised, some would say unsuitable, soccer pitch isn\u2019t the best advert for MLS, a league which has otherwise made great progress over the past decade or so in the construction of soccer-specific stadiums.\n\nThis situation could be accentuated further if NYC FC go on to host this year\u2019s MLS Cup, the league\u2019s showpiece event. As the East\u2019s No1 seed, this is entirely possible. \u201cWe have an exceptional team this year,\u201d says Bulova. \u201cHow embarrassing would it be to have the MLS Cup held in a baseball stadium? I almost hope it happens because it would shine a spotlight on to something NYC FC and MLS have to address.\u201d\n\nLocation wise, Yankee Stadium has a lot going for it. \u201cThe saving grace for NYC FC right now, being at Yankee Stadium, is that they\u2019re on the subway line,\u201d says Jack Bell, former soccer writer for the New York Times. \u201cYou can count on that to funnel people to the games. For me, that\u2019s one of the reasons NYC FC has consistently been able to draw 20,000 people to games.\u201d Indeed, NYC FC\u2019s average home attendance is better than most in the league. The Bronx, it would seem, is a good place for a soccer stadium. That\u2019s probably why City Football Group have identified a site, among a number of others, not far from Yankee Stadium in their search for a permanent home.\n\n\u201cI also like the stadium atmosphere a lot,\u201d adds Bulova. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s up there with some of the best in MLS.\u201d Just how much better would it be in a stadium designed for the sport being played, though? NYC FC fans must look at the state-of-the-art facilities that have opened in places like Minnesota, Los Angeles and Orlando in recent years and wonder what such a building would do for their club.\n\nFinding a suitable location in one of New York\u2019s five boroughs was always going to be challenging \u2013 particularly due to a lack of space and astronomical land prices in the city. Supporters are aware of this and have some sympathy for the difficulty encountered by the franchise. They point to how the New York Red Bulls took what they could get and have since been left to rue the shortcomings of their Harrison, New Jersey location.\n\nPatience is starting to wane, though. That is perhaps best illustrated by falling attendances. With the exception of 2018 (which saw a jump to 23,211 from 22,643 the season before), NYC FC\u2019s average home crowd has fallen season-by-season since their expansion year in 2015, when their average gate stood at 29,016, to this year\u2019s figure of 21,107. That remains a solid number \u2013 ninth of the league\u2019s 24 teams \u2013 but the trend isn\u2019t a positive one.\n\nNYC FC had the likes of Lampard, Pirlo and Villa to draw fans over those early years and so the crowd figures aren\u2019t strictly an illustration of growing frustration over the stadium, but it cannot be discounted. \u201cWe know it\u2019s hard enough finding space to park your car in New York City let alone building a stadium for 25,000+ people, but the bigger problem is that the club lacks transparency on this issue,\u201d says Anthony Scarcello of the Dudes in Blue podcast. \u201cThey keep you in the dark, they don\u2019t tell you what their plans are, they don\u2019t tell you what they\u2019re trying to do and eventually that wears thin with New Yorkers.\u201d\n\nThe club says it is still committed to finding a new stadium. \u201cNew York City FC is actively pursuing a permanent home in NYC and exploring several options, including working with Maddd Equities in the Bronx,\u201d a club spokesperson told the Guardian. For many supporters, that isn\u2019t enough. Not after so many seasons at Yankee Stadium. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are many competent people trying to find a solution,\u201d says Bell, \u201cbut here we are five years down the road and still nothing.\u201d Playing at Citi Field this week won\u2019t help ease that frustration. \u201cIt makes us feel like the whole thing is in limbo,\u201d says Bulova. \u201cIt adds to that feeling of homelessness.\u201d", "description": "Five seasons into their existence, NYC FC are still in their temporary home of Yankee Stadium.
