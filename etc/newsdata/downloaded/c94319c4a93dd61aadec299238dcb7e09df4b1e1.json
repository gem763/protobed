Sound familiar? Here we go again \u2014 with China giving a textbook example of \u201cBack Pedaling 101.\u201d\n\nThe great build-up to last week\u2019s trade talks to gain progress with China seems to be a \u201cSwedish meatball served on a platter\u201d designed to do nothing more than have China agree to buy more American farm products and dial back on its practice of government-sponsored currency manipulation. In addition, the proposed hike in existing tariffs set for Oct. 15 would be suspended for now.\n\nTo correct President Trump, there was nothing \u201cvery substantial\u201d in this \u201cPhase One\u201d deal that I can see. And the devil is always in the details. Everything that went down last Thursday and Friday was by oral agreement. The terms of the deal will be written down over the next three to four weeks, right before the next set of tariffs slated for Dec. 15 are set to be activated. My take is this U.S.-Sino gathering was less on substance and more on optics to appease global markets.\n\nNone of the hard, structural issues were addressed during the talks. Omitted were cyber hacking, cracking down on intellectual property (IP) theft, Huawei\u2019s blacklisted products, China forcing foreign companies to transfer technology to gain access to its market, subsidizing state-owned companies, dumping products and commodities at below market rates to sabotage American companies and exporting illegal fentanyl to the United States. That latter deadly transgression takes a page out of the opium wars playbook in the 1800s.\n\nThere also was some nebulous language in the agreements that it would strengthen Chinese protections for American intellectual property and give financial services companies more access to China\u2019s market. There is no mention of transparency or accountability procedures or a blueprint of how to realistically make this happen, as it would involve a change in China\u2019s rule of law. But Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin stated, \u201cwe\u2019re very, very close to a deal on that.\u201d However, once again, any outline or details were left out.\n\nBoth President Trump of the United States and President Xi of China wanted a political victory, and the only way to gain it was to avoid talking about what got us in the trade war in the first place. I won\u2019t be the least bit surprised if we hear from China that it had a different understanding of the issues that emerged from the talks and we\u2019re back to square one. When the topic emerges of Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges having to open their books or risk delisting and face a ban on investments by U.S. pension funds, tensions will be right back on the rise \u2014 and this action is making its way through Congress right now.\n\nWhen one considers the confluence of a partial trade deal with China, a possible breakthrough in the Brexit negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union, as well as the Fed announcing stepped-up, overnight repurchase agreement (repo) operations that will continue through January, one would think the stock market could reach new all-times, if earnings season delivers on the upside. But let\u2019s take stock of what the market has to overcome.\n\nThere is no timeline to remove any of the existing U.S.-China tariffs. There has been no progress on Chinese companies adhering to U.S. accounting standards, and the temporary truce does little to change the narrative of slowing growth for 2020. \u201cTariffs have been the tip of the spear in Trump\u2019s trade wars,\u201d Chris Krueger, senior policy analyst at Cowen, said in a recent note to clients. \u201cThe next fronts \u2014 capital flows, [more] export controls, supply chain duress, industrial policy \u2014 are the global plumbing of the real economy.\u201d\n\nThe impact of this next round in the trade wars, Krueger said, \u201ccan produce exogenous shocks to the global system that can dwarf the tariffs.\u201d So, with the understanding that there is a lot more geopolitical wood to chop, there are a couple things that stand out for investors.\n\nFirst, under the slower-growth model, the Fed likely will keep cutting interest rates and boosting liquidity, which will partly find its way into equity markets. Second, bond yields will stay low and drive global capital flows into U.S. stocks with juicy dividend yields that are positioned in the defensive sectors \u2014 namely utilities, telecommunications companies, real estate investment trusts (REITs), defense and consumer staples.\n\nBond yields spiked this past week, with the benchmark 10-year T-Note moving up from 1.54% on Wednesday to 1.76% as of Friday\u2019s close. Hence, most high-dividend defensive stocks traded lower as \u201chopium\u201d for a re-acceleration in profit growth and the high-beta growth stocks took temporary hold of investor sentiment. No one would welcome this rotation more than me, but my view is that it\u2019s premature and that a resumption of S&P earnings growth and price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple expansion is much further out.\n\nThe great majority of subscribers to my high-yield advisory service, Cash Machine, view dividends and yield as the most important aspects of their portfolios. For such investors, we are getting another window of opportunity to capture attractive entry points on pullbacks to lock in solid yields in companies that have strong histories of raising dividends while being invested in sectors that are recession resistant. Click here to learn about Cash Machine and see if the current model portfolio that pays a blended yield of 8.6% is right for you. While no one has a crystal ball as to what the road ahead is going to deliver, buying the current dip on defensive dividend stocks looks very timely.\n\nThe post China Deal \u2013 Hold the Champagne appeared first on Stock Investor.", "description": "I can use the phrase \u201cthe ink isn\u2019t even dry\u201d .10/14/2019 19:19:37PM EST.", "authors": ["Bryan Perry", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
