We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons\u2026\ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nIn a thread he said: \u2018We\u2019ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought.\n\n\u2018A political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn another tweet Mr Dorsey said: \u2018While internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions.\n\n\u2018Internet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes. All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale.\u2019\n\nA final note. This isn\u2019t about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It\u2019s worth stepping back in order to address. \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nMr Dorsey said it was time for more forward thinking regulation on political ads.\n\nHe said the ban would include a few exceptions, such as advertising for voter registration.\n\nThe thread concluded: \u2018This isn\u2019t about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It\u2019s worth stepping back in order to address.\u2019\n\nThe timing means the ban will be in place in time for the UK snap election.\n\nIt follows criticism directed art Facebook over its controversial decision to exempt ads by politicians from third-party fact-checking.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg told Congress last week that politicians have the right to free speech on Facebook.\n\nHowever, there are fears this will allow them to lie freely.\n\nCEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey said political message reach should be earned, not bought (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe announcement has been widely praised by people on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupporting the ban, one twitter user said: \u2018Exactly right, free expression does not mean destroying democracy by allowing political ads/propaganda that spread lies, misinformation, and disinformation.\u2019\n\nAnother said it should be a \u2018memo\u2019 to Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThis is a breaking news story.
