This one of a kind \u200bgathering brings together mayors from around the world, along with urban experts, business leaders, artists and activists.\n\nThis year we were in Paris, a global center for art, fashion, food and culture. The city \u200boffers an extraordinary backdrop for this change-making experience. For two and a half days, participants came together to explore solutions for the most pressing issues facing city leaders and city dwellers alike. Through panel discussions, one on one conversations, workshops and field trips, the event was a showcase for innovation and ingenuity. And while there are deep divisions in the world today, CityLab attendees are united by their ambition to make their cities more vibrant and livable.\n\nWatch full event videos\n\nTweet #CityLabParis\n\nWe\u2019re proud to announce that CityLab 2018 will be held in Detroit.\n\nWatch the special announcement below:\n\nMayors in attendance at CityLab 2017:\n\nSteve Adler\n\nMayor, City of Austin\n\nAbdulla Al Shaibani\n\nSecretary General, City of Dubai\n\nYousef Al Shawarbeh\n\nMayor, City of Amman\n\nMegan Barry\n\nMayor, City of Nashville\n\nHerbert Constantine M.
