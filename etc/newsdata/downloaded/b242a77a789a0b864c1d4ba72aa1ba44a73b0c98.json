New iPhones, new Pixels, new Surface devices, new Echos... and a new Banana Phone.\n\nNow, before I tell you more about the biggest tech gadget of 2019, I want to be perfectly clear that the Banana Phone isn\u2019t a phone \u2014 it\u2019s a Bluetooth headset that connects to your phone, and you can use it to take calls. But it looks like a banana!\n\nAnd soon, it\u2019s getting a refresh. Earlier today, I spotted FCC filings for an updated model of the Banana Phone, so I called up Brian Brunsing, president of Banana Phone LLC, to learn more about what\u2019s new. Turns out, it has some meaningful updates.\n\nThe biggest new feature: the new Banana Phone will apparently be able to play music over a speaker that\u2019s louder than the original model\u2019s. So yes, you can now play Raffi\u2019s \u201cBananaphone\u201d on a literal banana phone.\n\nDon\u2019t expect the new Banana Phone to be a Sonos replacement, though \u2014 Brunsing told me the new model isn\u2019t designed to compete in the speaker space. And honestly, I don\u2019t really care how it sounds compared to a Sonos. \u201cBananaphone\u201d on a banana phone. Come on.\n\nBrunsing also tells me that the new Banana Phone has an improved battery life of 20 hours of talk time, up from 10 hours. And the price remains the same at $39.99.\n\nIf the new improvements are enough for you to take the plunge, Brunsing tells me you\u2019ll be able to get your hands on the new version sometime around Black Friday.\n\nThe first Banana Phone launched as an Indiegogo campaign in 2017. My colleagues Jake Kastrenakes and Chaim Gartenberg tested a call on that original model, although the quality didn\u2019t seem to be very good at all.\n\nBanana phone hands on We tested the Banana Phone and it was awful. Posted by Circuit Breaker on Saturday, December 2, 2017\n\nWe\u2019re not sure if the new one will be much better for talking to your friends. But if you\u2019ve always wanted to have a banana-shaped phone that \u2014 and I can\u2019t stress this enough \u2014 can actually play the song \u201cBananaphone,\u201d you\u2019ll be able to do that very soon.", "description": "The Banana Phone is getting a refresh.
