Mayans is a spin-off of the popular FX series Sons of Anarchy, which Sutter created and also oversaw.\n\nFX is now owned by The Walt Disney Company, but is still headed by CEO John Landgraf.\n\nThe Reporter ran a farewell email that Sutter sent colleagues, in which he reportedly described himself as an \u201cabrasive dick.\u201d He said he was fired by Landgraf and Disney TV Studios head Dana Walden, following an internal investigation by Disney.\n\n\u201cNot the way I wanted to end my 18 year relationship with FX,\u201d Sutter wrote. \u201cAt least being fired for being an abrasive dick is on brand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI deeply apologize if I\u2019ve made people feel less than or unsupported. My intention was literally the opposite. But clearly I\u2019ve not been paying attention. My arrogance and chronic distraction has created wreckage. Just know, I adore this cast and crew,\u201d he added.\n\nSutter\u2019s difficult personality has been widely known for years, and has been on display on his Twitter profile.\n\nHe once insulted the CBS sitcom The Odd Couple, starring Matthew Perry, saying the writers should be \u201cbitchslapped.\u201d\n\njesus christ, we've just completely fucking given up on originality.\n\nthese writers should be bitchslapped. http://t.co/khhTQnOLbz \u2014 kurt sutter (@sutterink) February 25, 2014\n\nThe Reporter ran an interview with Sutter last year in which the show runner shared a framed copy of a letter he received detailing his \u201cunprofessional behavior\u201d on Sons of Anarchy and with executives at Fox 21.\n\nFor the second season of Mayans, Sutter took a back seat to co-creator Elgin James. The Reporter said a decision on a third season has not yet been determined.\n\nSutter hadn\u2019t commented on Twitter about his firing Thursday afternoon, but he posted a cryptic Instagram message about Disney.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
