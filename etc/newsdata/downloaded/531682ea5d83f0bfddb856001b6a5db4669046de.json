I would much rather do diapers if I didn't have to wake up in the middle of the night, to be honest with you.'", "description": "To mark baby Marli Grace turning six weeks, both Chance The Rapper and his wife Kirsten Bennett shared a new picture of the adorable newborn.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/19/19552602-0-image-a-27_1570730768654.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
