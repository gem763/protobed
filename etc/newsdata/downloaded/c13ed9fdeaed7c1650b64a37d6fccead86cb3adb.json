Photo: Reuters\n\nThe price of oil surged on Monday, following an attack on Saudi Arabian facilities that has ratcheted up tensions between the US and Iran.\n\nDrone strikes hit two Saudi Arabian oil facilities on Saturday, knocking out about half of the country\u2019s oil output. The attack has knocked out an estimated 5% of global oil supply and US President Donald Trump on Sunday authorised a release of crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).\n\nThe price of oil futures spiked by 20% at the open in London, the most on record, amid the fall in supply and escalating tensions in the key oil producing region.\n\nREAD MORE: Attack spark huge inferno at two Saudi Arabian oil refineries\n\nBy 7.45am UK time, prices had settled down slightly. Brent futures (BZ=F) were up by 10% to $66.34 a barrel and crude was up 9% to $59.80 (CL=F).\n\n\u201cThis attack has material implications for the oil market,\u201d said Alan Gelder, VP for refining, chemicals and oil markets at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.\n\n\u201cA loss of 5 million barrels per day of supplies from Saudi Arabia cannot be met for long by existing inventories and the limited spare capacity of the other OPEC+ group members. A geopolitical risk premium will return to the oil price.\u201d\n\nAnalyst Jon Rigby and team at UBS said in a note on Monday morning: \u201cThe direct impact from the shutdown on physical oil markets will be determined by its duration, and the CEO of Saudi Aramco said on Saturday that an update will be provided in 48 hours.\u201d\n\nAs well as supply fears, increasing tensions between the US and Iran are also contributing to rising prices amid fears of potential conflict between the two countries in the region.\n\nThe Saudi Arabia attack were reportedly carried out by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels but the US has blamed Iran, claiming the Middle Eastern state supported the rebels.\n\nOver the weekend, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo accused Iran of \u201can unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply\u201d and US president Donald Trump tweeted that the US was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d if Saudi Arabia requires.\n\nIran has denied it is behind Saturday\u2019s attack and warned it was ready for war.\n\n\u201cThe Middle East continues to sit on a powder keg and might soon face significant geopolitical challenges,\u201d Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fongern, an FX and macro strategist, at MAF Global Forex, said.\n\n\u201cIndeed, I expect oil prices to rise in the longer term, as tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia are unlikely to be short-lived\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "Drone strikes hit two Saudi Arabian oil facilities on Saturday, knocking out about half of the country\u2019s oil output.", "authors": ["Oscar Williams-Grut", "Senior City Correspondent", "Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/E9TxUXAfRtt1x2ZnYHXZTQ--~B/aD0yOTk5O3c9NTE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/03958810-d78e-11e9-adf9-6e0ae3461a4b", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
