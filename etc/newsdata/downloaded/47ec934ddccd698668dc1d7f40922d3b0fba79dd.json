It wants to establish a continuous presence in the markets and show it can refinance itself alone, without external support.\n\n\"You're seeing more and more real money investors returning to this market - there's been strong real money participation all year but it's definitely continuing in terms of that part of the investor base,\" a banker on the deal told Reuters.\n\nAbout 55 billion euros of Greek debt is traded in the markets, out of a total of around 330 billion euros. The rest is held by its official lenders, the European Stability Mechanism, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank.\n\nYields of Greek bonds have dropped to record lows the last few months. The country issued in March its first 10-year bond since plunging into a debt crisis in 2010, with a yield of 3.90% and a coupon of 3.875. It has fallen to 1.37% since then.\n\nThe new bond was priced to yield 1.50%, five basis points down from initial guidance of 1.55%, the highest among eurozone countries in this tenor.\n\nGreece can stay afloat without recourse to markets up to 2022 thanks to a 34 billion euro cash buffer it has built with unused loans and money raised from markets.\n\n($1 = 0.9102 euros) (Reporting by Lefteris Papadimas, Yoruk Bahceli Editing by Tommy Wilkes and Tom Brown)", "description": "By Lefteris Papadimas and Yoruk  BahceliATHENS/LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Greece drew strong demand  the reopening of its 10-year bond on Tuesday, marking...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
