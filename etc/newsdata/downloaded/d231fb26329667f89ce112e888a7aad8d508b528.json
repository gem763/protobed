The couple I\u2019d like to save is Mike & Katya.\"\n\nMotsi said: \"I felt a strong performance, stronger body actions, stronger leg actions. I\u2019m saving Catherine & Johannes.\"\n\nWhile Bruno added: \"It\u2019s hard because you\u2019ve both done very, very well, but purely based on tonight I have to save the couple that got me tingling a little bit more and I have to save Catherine & Johannes.\"\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nShirley was given the final decision and decided that Mike had put in a stronger performance in the dance-off.\n\nThe head judge said: \"Well, I thought both couples really step it up a notch and this is always the most difficult decision for me.\n\n\"But based on a good focus, difficult content, with some really beautiful footwork in there with stronger technical skills for me, cleaner and polished. I\u2019m going to save Mike & Katya.\"\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nCatherine was left in tears after being told she was going home after failing to impress with her Cha Cha to Scared Of The Dark by Steps.\n\nGiving her reaction, she turned to Johannes and said: \"Him, yeah, he\u2019s like my best friend. He\u2019s just\u2026oooh, (referring to eye make-up) it\u2019s waterproof\u2026just the opportunity to work with amazing people and get critiqued off amazing people.\n\n\"I never thought I\u2019d say this, I\u2019m going to keep it up because I fell in love with it!
