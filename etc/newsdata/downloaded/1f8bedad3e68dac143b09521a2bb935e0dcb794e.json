It faces east, toward ancient Jericho. It is often crowded with Muslim worshipers after prayers at Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third-holiest shrine.\n\nMany Jewish worshipers take another route to Judaism\u2019s nearby Western Wall. They pass through the Dung Gate, the closest entrance to the holy place, and Jewish families on their way to celebrate a 13-year-old son\u2019s bar mitzvah can be spotted making their way to the wall.\n\nSecurity is always tight in this volatile area at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israeli police patrol and closed-circuit TV cameras monitor the passageways of the Old City.\n\nA man walks along a path near the Golden Gate in Jerusalem's Old City.
