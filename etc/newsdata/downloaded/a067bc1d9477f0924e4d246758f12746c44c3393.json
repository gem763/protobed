I was able to change the way people think of Tripoli.\u201d\n\nLike his fellow Lebanese, Karimeh wants government reform, stating he wants a government that reflects the needs and sensibilities of ordinary citizens like himself.\n\n\u201cI will tell you this but you might laugh,\u201d he said. \u201cI want someone like me to be in power. Someone who loves life. A person ambitious like me.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s impromptu rave party in Tripoli was just one of the many spontaneous demonstrations across Lebanon as part of a populist uprising protesting corruption and tax hikes. The demonstrations started last Thursday in response to a proposed $0.20 tax on calls made via WhatsApp and other messaging services. Although the government quickly dropped the plans, the protests morphed into demands for a sweeping overhaul of Lebanon\u2019s political system, with grievances ranging from austerity measures to poor infrastructure.\n\nThousands rallied across the country on Saturday, chanting \u201crevolution\u201d or \u201cthe people demand the fall of the regime\u201d \u2014 a common refrain of demonstrations in other parts of the Middle East.\n\nOn Sunday, hundreds of thousands of Lebanese men, women, and children gathered in central Beirut and other cities to demand better living conditions and the ouster of a cast of politicians who have monopolized power and influence for decades.\n\nThe protests have united all of Lebanon\u2019s sectarian groups, as euphoric crowds partied deep into the night, leaving all political and sectarian paraphernalia at home to gather under the national cedar flag, dancing to impromptu concerts, and chanting often hilarious anti-establishment slogans.\n\nThe Tripoli demonstration-turned-music-festival is indicative of the peaceful atmosphere of the protests, which have been largely good-natured. Some protesters have enjoyed singing or launching into the traditional Lebanese dabke dances, while others played cards and smoked shisha into the early hours on Saturday.\n\nThe protests \u2014 which some have dubbed the \u201cWhatsApp revolution\u201d \u2014 have also been marked by their diversity, drawing wide swathes of Lebanese society largely united on what they oppose, with many condemning the entire political class as thieves and criminals.\n\nLebanon\u2019s political system was set up to balance power between the country\u2019s religious sects or \u201cconfessions,\u201d including Christians, Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims, and Druze. But critics say Lebanon\u2019s confessional system of government has the unintended consequence of entrenching political patronage and pitting citizens against each other along sectarian lines. Many current senior politicians came to prominence during the country\u2019s 15-year civil war that ended in 1990.\n\nLebanon\u2019s debt-burdened economy has been on the brink of collapse for some time. Although the initial grievances of the protesters were over proposed tax hikes, the demonstrations have evolved into a massive push to unseat ruling dynasties widely seen as corrupt beyond redemption.\n\nLebanon\u2019s teetering government met Monday to approve a belated economic rescue plan as thousands gathered for a fifth day of mass protests against the ruling elite. The cabinet meeting was chaired by President Michel Aoun and was expected to approve a raft of measures, including the scrapping of new taxes and a sweeping privatization program, among others.\n\nIn a television address last Friday, Prime Minister Saad Hariri gave his coalition partners 72 hours to back his rescue plan. The deadline expires at 7:00 p.m. Monday (1600 GMT), and Hariri\u2019s wording suggested he could resign if his move failed.\n\nLebanon\u2019s embattled political leaders have warned that the government\u2019s resignation at this time would only deepen the crisis gripping the small Mediterranean country.\n\nSchools, banks, universities, and many private businesses closed their doors Monday, both for security reasons and in an apparent bid to encourage people to join the demonstrations.\n\nAFP contributed to this article.", "description": "A mass protest in Lebanon against government corruption quickly turned into a music festival when a DJ pumped dance music over a loudspeaker.", "authors": ["Rebecca Mansour"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/tripoli-lebanon-protest-rave-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
