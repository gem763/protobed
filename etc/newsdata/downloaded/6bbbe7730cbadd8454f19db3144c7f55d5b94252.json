(AP) - If Clemson\u2019s defense is a work in progress, the growing pains aren\u2019t showing in the box score or the scoreboard.\n\nThe No. 4 Tigers appear to be as stingy as last year\u2019s national championship team.\n\nClemson (7-0, 5-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) hasn\u2019t yielded more than 294 yards since the opener against Georgia Tech or 20 points since edging North Carolina last month. Saturday\u2019s 45-10 rout of Louisville was the Tigers\u2019 latest dominant performance, as they held the Cardinals to just 263 yards, a field goal and a late touchdown.\n\nAsked about Clemson\u2019s yardage allowance, junior defensive end Justin Foster said: \u201cWe try not to think about that. At the end of the day we just try to dominate them to best of our ability.\u201d\n\nThe Tigers\u2019 success to that end is impressive considering they replaced seven regulars from that title team.\n\nClemson\u2019s most obvious changes have been up front as it sought to fill voids left by the departures of Clelin Ferrell and Dexter Lawrence, both NFL first-round draft selections. Senior tackle Nyles Pinckney is the depth chart\u2019s only defensive line starter without an \u201cor\u201d listed next to his position, with redshirt underclassmen saturating the other three spots.\n\nThat unit has steadily progressed, and Clemson coach Dabo Swinney credits coordinator Brent Venables and his staff for recruiting and developing prospects who are contributing. But Swinney\u2019s highest praise is for the back seven for setting the tone in shutting down opponents.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve recruited well, and guys stepped up,\u201d Swinney said after the Louisville victory. \u201cBut everything starts with our back seven. They\u2019ve been tremendous and very consistent all year.\u201d\n\nClemson ranks fifth in the FBS in total defense at 256 yards allowed per game and eighth in scoring defense at just 12 points per contest. The scoring average is a point lower than the 13.1 that led the nation last season.\n\nEven with a 21-20 escape at UNC that has resulted in the Tigers\u2019 steady drop from No. 1 in the rankings at the start of the season, they\u2019ve remained consistent in limiting opponents\u2019 yardage and points. Florida State and Louisville combined for just 516 yards and 24 points the past two weeks.\n\nThe Tigers forced three turnovers Saturday, with two leading to 10 points. Clemson also recorded six sacks, with two each by Foster and junior linebacker Isaiah Simmons, who is tied for 20th nationally with six. Clemson is tied for fourth nationally at four sacks per game.\n\nSwinney was pleased most by how Clemson stifled a Cardinals\u2019 offense that entered the game having registered 103 points and 1,184 yards the previous two weeks to just 107 yards passing and a season low in scoring. The Cardinals didn\u2019t reach the end zone until Javian Hawkins\u2019 3-yard touchdown run with 5:10 remaining.\n\n\u201cWe had turnovers, gave our offense the ball back,\u201d Clemson junior cornerback A.J. Terrell said. \u201cSo, I feel like we did good.\u201d\n\nThe performance wasn\u2019t perfect, but the Tigers took heart in locking down another opponent and giving the offense frequent opportunities. The names might be different and a little younger, but the results are looking familiar.\n\n___\n\nAP freelance writer Steve Bittenbender contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball , https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ap-top-25-college-football-podcast/id1138957862?mt=2\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "If Clemson's defense is a work in progress, the growing pains aren't showing in the box score or the scoreboard.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gary B.
