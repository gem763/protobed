Under that arrangement, the Scottish airport not only refuels American military planes but also helps arrange hotel accommodations for arriving crews, as it does for some civilian and commercial aircraft.\n\n\u201cWe provide a full handling service for customers and routinely arrange overnight accommodation for visiting aircrew when requested,\u201d the Prestwick airport said in a statement on Monday. \u201cWe use over a dozen local hotels, including Trump Turnberry, which accounts for a small percentage of the total hotel bookings we make.\u201d\n\nIt was through the arrangement with the Pentagon that a seven-person United States Air Force crew ended up staying at the Trump Turnberry in March. An Air Force C-17 military transport plane was on its way from Alaska to Kuwait when it stopped at Prestwick overnight to refuel and give the crew a break.\n\nThe crew, which consisted of active duty and national guard members from Alaska, was charged $136 per room, which was less expensive than a Marriott property\u2019s rate of $161. And both were under the per diem rate of $166.", "description": "The president\u2019s business worked with the Scottish airport to promote tourism.
