Can imagine the ball must be like a bar of soap out in those humid conditions but both sides need to do better as Scotland drop possession once again following a quick line-out in their own half. Samoa scrum. 21 min: Scotland 3-0 Samoa We have another Samoa scrum. It's solid, and away they go! Tim Nanai-Williams gets his hands on the ball just off the Samoa 10 and sends it downfield with a well-placed kick to put the pressure back on Scotland as we go for a line-out. 20 min: Scotland 3-0 Samoa Scotland continuing to mix up their play here. From a clean line-out, Finn Russell goes for the wrap-around off Sam Johnson but it doesn't quite work. The ball is frantically exchanged among the Scots before they find some composure at least to take it into contact. It's not exactly been crisp from Townsend's men, though they've admittedly looked more threatening. Samoa's defence isn't making matters any easier. 17 min: Scotland 3-0 Samoa Scotland try something different as Chris Harris threads through a grubber kick inside Samoa's 22. Sean Maitland burns the furnace to give chase but Belgium Tuatagaloa throws himself onto play a few metres out from his own line. Reinforcements arrive in numbers to stop the Scots getting any further and the danger is once again booted clear. Advertisement 15 min: Scotland 3-0 Samoa Scotland get the turnover, boot clear but Samoa are straight back into their opponents' half after successfully competing the high ball. A slight lull in intensity here as both sides look to pock and prod for those weak points without wanting to give too much away themselves. 14 min: Scotland 3-0 Samoa A pause in play as the medical staff treat both sets of teams for some knocks and bruises. After a minute breather, we set up for a Samoa scrum just outside their 22. And it's a penalty to Samoa. Scotland penalised for bringing the scrum down. Tusi Pisi kicks to the half way for the throw-in. 13 min: Scotland 3-0 Samoa Another dropped ball brings Samoa's attack off the line-out to an end, with the Scots mopping up play to clear the danger. This is poor from the Pacific Islanders. They've been far too inconsistent in their handling to do any damage, while the Scottish defence has been squeaky clean so far. 11 min: Scotland 3-0 Samoa Samoa penalty in their own half. They kick for touch, find it and set up for the line-out on Scotland's 22. Advertisement 9 min: Scotland 3-0 Samoa (Laidlaw penalty) Calm and composed, the Scottish 9 sends it clean through. The Dark Blues lead. 9 min: Scotland 0-0 Samoa Penalty for Scotland after the Samoans are pulled up for an early tackle. This is in kicking distance for Greg Laidlaw. 7 min: Scotland 0-0 Samoa Another line-out from Scotland inside their opponents' half. Moving right, the Dark Blues build up some speed but a fumbled pass is pounced on by Ed Fidow who boots the ball downfield. The danger is cleared. For now... 5 min: Scotland 0-0 Samoa As to be expected, it's a rock-solid scrum from Samoa. The ball is cleared out of their 22 for a Scotland line-out on the left. Advertisement 3 min: Scotland 0-0 Samoa Scotland building up some pace here. After some neat offloads in the centre of the park, the ball is sent right, Finn Russell skipping a number of hands to pick out Darcy Graham on the flank. The wing surges forward, dancing past two Samoans in the process, before he's eventually wrapped up. Scotland recycle and take play up to their opponent's 5-metre line down in the left-hand corner. The ref's hand goes up, and it's the Pacific Islanders who are awarded the put-in at the scrum. 1 min: Scotland 0-0 Samoa Greg Laidlaw finds touch from the base of the ruck, sending it 10 metres into Samoa's half. We have the first line-out of the match. KICK-OFF! Tusi Pisi sends it long and deep. Here we go! Okay, here we go, at last. This is going to be a big, big game of collisions. I'm expecting plenty of fireworks. Samoa to get us under way. Advertisement All done and dusted - time for Samoa's Siva Tau! And back they come to line up for the national anthems. Almost there. Just under 10 minutes to go until kick-off as the two squads head to the changing rooms for some final words. Not long to go. Meanwhile, Samoa coach Steve Jackson is hoping his side can follow Japan's giant-killing act by creating another World Cup shock this morning.\n\nHe said: \"I take my hat off to Japan. It was great to watch and, like any other team, we were almost cheering.\n\n\"It was a fantastic atmosphere and this Rugby World Cup here in Japan has been amazing.\n\n\"We watched the game yesterday and it's fantastic, isn't it? An upset in the Rugby World Cup. Now we will focus on Scotland and, if it goes the way we hope, it'll be another upset there.\n\n\"It just goes to show that you've got to turn up on the day and play a game of 80 minutes.\" Advertisement 1 2 Next\n\nMatch preview\n\nWhere can I watch it?\n\nLive coverage will be shown on ITV and the ITV Hub online at 7:25am.\n\nWhen is the match?\n\nScotland vs Samoa takes place on Monday 30 September at the Kobe Misaki Stdium.\n\nWhat time does it start?\n\nThe match kicks off at 7:15pm Japan Standard Time, which is 11:15am BST.\n\nOdds\n\nScotland to win: 1/6\n\nSamoa to win: 13/2\n\nDraw: 50/1\n\nPrediction\n\nScotland 25-20 Samoa: Scotland should deliver something of a response to last week\u2019s shocker against Ireland, and the nine days\u2019 rest will have helped compared to Samoa\u2019s week-turnaround. However, results between these two sides tend to be tight, and on the grand occasion of a World Cup clash, this should be no different.", "description": "Scotland simply have to defeat Samoa in Kobe to keep their Rugby World Cup 2019 hopes alive.
