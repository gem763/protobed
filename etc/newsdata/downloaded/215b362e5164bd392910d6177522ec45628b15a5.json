The Oscar-nominated actor had been serving time for her role in the Operation Varsity Blues college admissions scandal.\n\nHuffman pleaded guilty after admitting that she paid for her daughter\u2019s college test to be taken by someone else, disguising a $15,000 bribe as a charitable payment.\n\n\u201cI accept the court\u2019s decision today without reservation,\u201d Huffman said after her sentencing. \u201cI broke the law. I have admitted that and I pleaded guilty to this crime. There are no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period.\u201d\n\nOn top of her prison sentence, Huffman was also ordered to pay a $30,000 fine and commit to 250 hours of community service.\n\nThe investigation found more than 50 people were involved in the scheme, including the Full House actor Lori Loughlin. Along with her husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, she\u2019s accused of arranging a total payment of $500,000 in order to get her daughters into the University of Southern California.\n\nThis week the couple were hit with new charges of bribery which could lead to a 50-year prison sentence. \u201cOur goal from the beginning has been to hold the defendants fully accountable for corrupting the college admissions process through cheating, bribery and fraud,\u201d said the US attorney Andrew E Lelling. \u201cThe superseding indictments will further that effort.\u201d\n\nLoughlin and Giannulli have pleaded not guilty to the previous charges and will probably be headed to trial next year.", "description": "Actor released three days early from her brief stint after pleading guilty in the college admissions scandal, a prison official said", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36074ef11ffae8a8e3570cf73c38bf785b36cfc8/0_84_2887_1732/master/2887.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb8d748d2a52e5cb8aa7f0725749e404", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
