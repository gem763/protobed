Mitt Romney behind secret Twitter account 'Pierre Delecto': 'C'est moi'", "language": "en", "text": "Sen. Mitt Romney admitted Sunday that he uses a secret Twitter account called \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d to keep tabs on political debates unnoticed.\n\nThe 2012 Republican presidential nominee and former Massachusetts governor first mentioned the account during an interview with The Atlantic on Sunday, saying \u201cI won\u2019t give you the name of it,\u201d but, \u201cI\u2019m following 668 people.\u201d\n\nAfter some digging, Slate\u2019s Ashley Feinberg theorized that Mr. Romney was behind the Twitter handle @qaws9876, otherwise known as Pierre Delecto. His activity on the account included defending himself and liking tweets critical of the Trump administration.\n\nThe Utah senator later admitted that he was behind the account.\n\n\u201cC\u2019est moi,\u201d he told The Atlantic.\n\nThe Pierre Delecto account, which was created in 2011 during Mr. Romney\u2019s presidential campaign, has since been made private.\n\nAt least one Democrat applauded Mr. Romney\u2019s move. Former Secretary of State John Kerry tweeted, \u201cTouch\u00e9, S\u00e9nateur @MittRomney.
