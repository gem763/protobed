Musk said: \"Starship will allow us to inhabit other worlds.\"\n\nThe 164-foot-tall prototype is intended as a test vehicle that SpaceX will use to experiment with the technologies it hopes will one day bring a spaceship, and people, to Mars.\n\nOn Monday, Musk shared a video from inside the prototype's cargo bay. The video looks up through the ship, while the metallic echo in the audio gives a sense of just how big the space is.\n\n\"Production version will be a lot more polished than this prototype, but still fun to see,\" Musk wrote.\n\nRead more: Elon Musk just unveiled SpaceX's audacious new plan to build cities on Mars with giant Starship rockets.
