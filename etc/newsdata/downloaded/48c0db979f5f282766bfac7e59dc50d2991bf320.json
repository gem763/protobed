Photo: Getty Images and Studio Ghibli\n\nRonan Farrow is a man of many talents. Taking on sexual predators by day, clearly doing an extensive skin-care routine by night. But one of his lesser known talents really jumped out, really took center stage in the audiobook for his latest work: Catch and Kill. Yes, Catch and Kill chronicles his investigation into Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer, claims corruption reaches the highest levels of the entertainment industry, and tells the stories of victims (on top of dabbling in Jackie criticism). But it\u2019s also bursting with opportunity for Farrow to show off his voice-acting skills, which he alleges he perfected by dubbing minor roles in Studio Ghibli films, which, fun fact, are coming soon to HBO Max.\n\nIs anyone else listening to Ronan Farrow\u2019s audiobook of \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d and baffled by his decision to do voices? Important reporting/audition for SNL showcase? This is his \u201cTough Ukrainian Guy.\u201d pic.twitter.com/ULGGtNPAWe \u2014 Craig Rowin (@CraigRowin) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cI did work as an anime voice actor earlier in my career in a small way, and it was important to me to do as much justice as possible to the really brave characters,\u201d he reminded Variety and the world. In 2011, he voiced World History teacher in From Up on Poppy Hill and in 2013, he was a Mitsubishi employee in The Wind Rises. The Wind Rises famously lost the Oscar to Frozen, which isn\u2019t surprising but somehow still hurts, all these years later. Anyway, voicing an English dub doesn\u2019t fully explain why Farrow went all in on accents, but he does explain further.\n\n\u201cWe did a very careful, respectful job, and gave a lot of thought to making sure that those voices were differentiated in a way that would help the reader, and captured a little bit of who those people were,\u201d he reasons. \u201cBut also weren\u2019t full impersonations, it\u2019s sort of at the halfway mark. I\u2019m not an actor. But we wanted to make sure that it was imbued with a sufficient amount of character that these people came across in a full, well-rounded way.\u201d Well, we certainly got a full, well-rounded look at Farrow\u2019s voice-acting reel.
