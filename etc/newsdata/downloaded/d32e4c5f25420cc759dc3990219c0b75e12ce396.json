From a technical point of view, new entrepreneurs, or aspiring entrepreneurs, they have the opportunity to learn on the job, to learn in practice from an experienced entrepreneur. The experienced entrepreneur, on their side, they have the opportunity to stay in touch with the fresh motivated new entrepreneur.\"\n\nWhat's the satisfaction level? What kind of response have you had from the people who participate in the programme?\n\n\"At a European level, national level and local level, here in Puglia, we really register, as you can check on the website, we really register high motivation and satisfaction. The programme gives the opportunity to open new markets, to create a new relationship and to get a new experience.\n\nWho is eligible to take part in this programme ?\n\n\"We are talking about two main figures. New or aspiring entrepreneurs and experienced entrepreneurs from the other side. There is no age limit. There is no sector limit. The programme is directed towards SMEs, only SMEs, coming from one of the, still today, 28 member countries of the European Union, but also from, how to say, European territories. That means, for example, Albania, Turkey or Moldova.\"\n\nIf I'm interested in taking part in this programme. How can I find out more?\n\n''There's only one answer - the website. The programme is really a practical programme. It's all managed through the website. You can find first information. Second, practical manual for building your application.
