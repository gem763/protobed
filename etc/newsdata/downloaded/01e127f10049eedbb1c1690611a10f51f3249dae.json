Sign up here.\n\nFor post-Brexit Britain, the kindness of strangers and their money will be more vital than ever.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has amped up his rhetoric that the U.K. will leave the European Union at the end of this month -- even if there is no basis for a future relationship. In the worst-case scenario, a chaotic exit followed by ratings downgrades, a plunge in the pound, a government boosting spending and a central bank struggling to support markets could see capital flee from the country\u2019s bonds.\n\nIt\u2019s far from the consensus call -- gilts have up to now acted as a haven from Brexit risk. But some money managers are starting to worry about the U.K.\u2019s heavy reliance on foreign investment to finance its large current-account deficit -- or in Bank of England Governor Mark Carney\u2019s words the \u201ckindness of strangers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we have a no-deal Brexit then these strangers are going to get worried,\u201d said Mike Riddell, a portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors, which has reduced its U.K. debt holdings in recent weeks on the risk of a post-Brexit recession and rate hike. \u201cIn that environment are gilts going to be a safe haven? Absolutely not -- they are going to be the opposite of safe havens.\u201d\n\nA bond market crash would drive up the government\u2019s borrowing costs, making it more painful for any post-Brexit administration to spend its way out of trouble. Along with the initial economic disruption, that would risk snowballing into a deeper recession. Johnson struck a defiant tone Sunday, saying the U.K. will leave the European Union on Oct. 31 amid signs that talks have stalled.\n\nWhile the pound has slumped 18% since the June 2016 Brexit vote, gilts have returned investors nearly 20%. They have surged this year on global trade tensions and gloominess over the world economy, offering similar returns to U.S. Treasuries and more than Germany, according to Bloomberg Barclays Indexes. And unlike German bonds, they still offer positive yields.\n\nThe past year has seen overseas buyers snap up gilts at the fastest pace since 2016, increasing their holdings since the Brexit referendum by around 100 billion pounds ($123 billion), according to data from the BOE. That compares to $7 billion of foreign investor net outflows from U.K. equities this year.\n\nWhile debt from developed markets tends to rally on economic weakness -- due to speculation central banks will cut interest rates -- in emerging markets capital tends to flee, due to rising repayment risks or a loss of confidence. Volatility in sterling is already at emerging-market levels and U.K. assets are set for a substantial repricing once the Brexit outcome becomes known, the BOE\u2019s Carney said last month.\n\nZero Exposure\n\nRiddell\u2019s $2.8 billion Allianz Gilt Yield Fund has \u201cgot room to go more bearish,\u201d while the $788 million Allianz Strategic Bond Fund has \u201czero exposure\u201d to gilts, he said.\n\nNorth Asset Management\u2019s Chief Investment Officer George Papamarkakis has a similar view and is looking at betting on a decline in long-maturity gilts. To him, whoever forms the next government after a no-deal Brexit is likely to increase spending.\n\n\u201cIt is pretty simple equation -- you\u2019ve got less demand because of uncertainty and you would have more supply because the policy of choice now is fiscal,\u201d Papamarkakis said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it is a pretty clear trade to be short longer-dated gilts.\u201d\n\nDiverse Investors\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Debt Management Office says the gilt market is in a relatively solid position given deep liquidity and a diverse investor base, being more than triple the size it was 11 years ago at over 1.6 trillion pounds.\n\n\u201cThe underlying strength of the market has stood us in good stead over the past few years against the impact of a number of external events, not least the result of the EU referendum in 2016 and the unexpected result of the general election in 2017,\u201d said Robert Stheeman, the DMO\u2019s chief executive. \u201cContrary to the expectations of many, the gilt market has reacted in an orderly way.\u201d\n\nForeign investors held over 556 billion pounds of gilts, or 28% of the total, as of March. While this vote of confidence implies they don\u2019t expect a disorderly Brexit in the near future, the data on non-resident buying needs to be watched for any signs of slowing demand, said John Wraith, the head of U.K. rates strategy at UBS Group AG.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets?
