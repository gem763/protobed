Over the past two decades, the S&P 500 has averaged a September decline of 1.1%, making the ninth month of the year the worst one for domestic stocks.\n\nSource: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf course, seasonal trends don\u2019t always hold true to past precedent, giving investors hope that this September will defy past trends. Tuesday\u2019s market action suggests otherwise.\n\nFollowing another concerning economic data point and just two days after the U.S. proceeded with a 15% tariff on $112 billion worth of Chinese imports, the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.11% while the S&P 500 dipped 0.69%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average started September with a loss of 1.08%. In late trading, 23 of the Dow\u2019s 30 members were trading lower.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n\u201cThe Institute for Supply Management\u2019s purchasing managers index fell to 49.1 in August, weaker than all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists, data released Tuesday showed,\u201d according to Bloomberg.\n\nThat report was certainly one of the reasons why stocks swooned in the first trading of the month because ISM readings below 50 are viewed as poor. Unfortunately, ominous economic data points have recently been accumulating, fueling the fires of recession speculation.\n\nCyclical Carnage\n\nOn a day like today, it\u2019s not surprising to see higher beta stocks from cyclical sectors lead the market lower. That\u2019s exactly what happened on the Dow. Even if I categorize Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and American Express (NYSE:AXP) as value, not cyclical stocks, because they reside in a value sector, both lost more than 2% today and where joined in that dubious club by the likes of Boeing (NYSE:BA), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Dow (NYSE:DOW).\n\nMore market observers are extolling the virtues of defensive names while highlighting potential vulnerabilities in growth and cyclical stocks.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Mike Wilson noted, \u201cthe firm\u2019s chief U.S. equity strategist, sees defensive bond proxies outperform growth names by another 10% as the U.S.-China trade war weighs on consumer sentiment, which adds to a long list of recessionary indicators that are already flashing red,\u201d reports CNBC.\n\nDow Smart Moves\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) was one of a small number of Dow winners today. The retail giant posted a modest gain after CEO Doug McMillon said the company is moving to substantially reduce its sales of firearms ammunition following a spate of deadly shootings across the U.S. this year.\n\n\u201cAfter selling through our current inventory commitments, we will discontinue sales of short-barrel rifle ammunition such as the .223 caliber and 5.56 caliber that, while commonly used in some hunting rifles, can also be used in large capacity clips on military-style weapons,\u201d said McMillon in a memo to Walmart staffers.\n\nHe added that Walmart \u201cwill sell through and discontinue handgun ammunition; and we will discontinue handgun sales in Alaska, marking our complete exit from handguns.\u201d\n\nTech Time\n\nNot surprisingly, Dow technology names were weak today, including Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). That stock was bludgeoned in August and is now in world of technical distress.\n\nSeparately, semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) also traded lower, but company insiders remain committed to the shares. While the recent round of buys by Intel executives were scheduled, it pays to remember that insiders only buy their shares for one reason: because they believe the stock is going higher.\n\nBottom Line: An Ominous Start to the Dow This Month\n\nThis was not the way to start September, which I noted has a poor reputation at best. Rising volatility coupled with increasingly rough economic data puts added burdens on the White House to ameliorate the trade situation with China and for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, but only one of those outcomes can be seen as \u201creliable.\u201d", "description": "September has a dubious reputation among the 12 months when it comes to equity market performance.
