They are rarer than their male counterparts. At a global level, 95% of people who commit murder are men.\n\nThis violent crime is hardly out of an impulsive act of rage, but rather a long build up of frustration and anger which results in calculated and sophisticated plotting to fix what they deem as a stumbling block. And it can be a stumbling block in terms of love, money or power. Sometimes all three. Especially when they\u2019re from upper or middle class families.\n\nAward-winning journalist Tanya Farber, in Blood on Her Hands: South Africa\u2019s most notorious female killers, exquisitely tells the stories of nine women who have grabbed headlines with their horrifying tales of murder.\n\nFarber unpacks the lives, minds and motivations of some of South Africa\u2019s most notorious murderers, from the poisonous nurse Daisy de Melker and the privileged but deeply disturbed Najwa Petersen to the mysterious Joey Haarhoff, who died before revealing the fate of her victims.\n\nAlso included in the book are the stories of Charmaine Phillips, Phoenix Racing Cloud Theron, Marlene Lehnberg and Celiwe Mbokazi.\n\nI personally got sucked into some stories more than others. One of the more interesting and disturbing stories is that of serial killer De Melker, only the second woman to be hanged in 1932, for poisoning two husbands and a son \u2013 that\u2019s besides the deaths of four of her other children who died prior to her conviction.\n\nHaarhoff might have died in 1990 before being held accountable for her role in the abduction and murder of girls in the 1980s, but today she is still being talked about because the families of her victims didn\u2019t get closure when her partner and accomplice Gert van Rooyen decided to blow their brains out.\n\nAnd who can forget Najwa, wife of music icon Taliep Petersen who is serving 28 years behind bars for the murder of her husband in 2006. Petersen carefully planned a house robbery to eliminate her husband. She had already stabbed him in the neck just before that.\n\nChan\u00e9 van Heerden did something bizarre and incredibly cruel. She put her victim\u2019s facial skin in the freezer for preservation. She had an unusual obsession with skinning humans.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the very angry and jealous Dina Rodrigues. Many thought that she wouldn\u2019t harm a fly, but she organised a hit on the baby of her boyfriend.\n\nIn most of the murder cases, these women personally knew their victims.\n\nDespite the brutality and shock factor of the book, Blood on Her Hands is written in a style lighter than the subject matter suggests and makes it impossible for you to put the book down.\n\nFarber takes you through each case, against the backdrop of the different eras and regions of the 20th and early 21st centuries the women operated in and incredibly captures her audience from one chapter to the next.\n\nShe toys with your emotions and makes you feel as if you\u2019re following ghosts to relive their darkest moments \u2013 as if you\u2019re a witness to these crimes. Farber delves into their lives, their relationships, their histories and their final acts \u2013 murder.\n\nI\u2019m personally fascinated by the minds of murderers, and in this case where women are the masterminds, the intrigue is even greater.", "description": "Blood on Her Hands: South Africa\u2019s most notorious female killers by Tanya Farber.", "authors": ["Rhod\u00e9 Marshall"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9466/365e424e92244138841cf710dc81b756.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
