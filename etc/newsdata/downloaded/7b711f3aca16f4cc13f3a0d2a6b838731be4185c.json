REUTERS/Lim Huey Teng\n\nKUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d it would win the confidence of investors and ratings agencies for its 2020 budget, its finance minister said on Saturday, as the government prioritized boosting growth over reducing the deficit in the short term.\n\nLim Guan Eng told reporters that given the global economic uncertainties, the country needed to \u201cnot only convince but reassure investors\u201d that the Southeast Asian nation will be back on track for fiscal consolidation in 2021.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s government unveiled on Friday a smaller budget than expected for next year but flagged a wider budget deficit than earlier estimated, and said it would step in with stimulus measures should global demand worsen.\n\nThe government projected a fiscal deficit of 3.2% of gross domestic product (GDP), larger than an initial target of 3% but lower than this year\u2019s 3.4%.\n\n\u201cSo far the response by both the World Bank and even Moody\u2019s have been positive so we are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to convince not just foreign investors and fund managers but also ratings agencies that this is necessary in order to ensure sustainable economic growth,\u201d Lim said.\n\nWorld Bank lead economist for Malaysia, Richard Record said in a note overnight that the budget was \u201ca prudent balance between the competing needs for Malaysia to preserve fiscal sustainability, while also responding to the realities of a slowing economic environment\u201d.\n\nRecord also said proposals to reform the country\u2019s investment incentives framework was a step in the right direction.\n\nSovereign risk senior analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Anushka Shah said in a note late Friday that Malaysia\u2019s fiscal strength will continue to constrain its credit profile but the budget\u2019s emphasis on backing higher-value added industries and on infrastructure development will support growth against a challenging global environment.\n\nEsther Lai, head of sovereign ratings at RAM Ratings, a Malaysian ratings agency said the 3.2% deficit target was within expectations. \u201cIt is a pragmatic target as the government is striking a balance between supporting growth and keeping its promise for fiscal consolidation.\u201d", "description": "Malaysia is \"cautiously optimistic\" it would win the confidence of investors and ratings agencies for its 2020 budget, its finance minister said on Saturday, as the government prioritized boosting growth over reducing the deficit in the short term.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1439988121&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B08D", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
