When the Luxembourg court ruled that Poland had broken EU law in the Supreme Court case, the government conformed to the ruling.\n\nThere are several more cases pending at the court but, during the campaign, Mr Kaczynski vowed to continue the reform.\n\nJacek Karnowski, a journalist for pro-Law and Justice weekly wSieci, said it was now a question of prestige for Mr Kaczynski to complete the reforms.\n\n\"Unless you reform the judiciary, you can't have a prosperous free market country and you can't break the post-communist networks and mafias,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"[Mr Kaczynski] suspects judges of being politically motivated, of wanting to topple the government. He does not want to dominate the judiciary 100% because he knows that's not possible, but he wants to make it less on the side of the opposition,\" he said.\n\nA threat to democracy?\n\nKonstanty Gebert, a columnist for the liberal Gazeta Wyborcza daily, which is anti-Law and Justice, says the party's policies have weakened democracy, although it does not wish to destroy it.\n\n\"They essentially believe that having a parliamentary majority gives them the right to do whatever they please and that the peoples' will is more important than the law,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"It's a mistake to believe that their goal is to destroy democratic institutions. They are not ideologically undemocratic. They wouldn't support anything the people wouldn't support. Their version of democracy is majoritarian democracy,\" he said.\n\nImage caption Poland has seen an increasing number of equality marches in 2019, including this one in Torun\n\nMinorities, like LGBT people in Poland, will likely continue to be stigmatised as a threat to traditional families and Catholic Polish society as they were by Law and Justice during the election campaign.\n\nWhat challenges does it face?\n\nDuring Law and Justice's first term, there was talk of introducing legislation to restrict foreign-owned companies' share of the private media market.\n\nBut the party may pull back from that, because it did not do as well as it hoped, Mr Karnowski argues.\n\nThe re-entry of the left after a four-year absence and the arrival of the far-right Confederation to the Polish parliament pose challenges to Law and Justice's dominance this term, says Konstanty Gebert.\n\n\"Law and Justice are now the establishment. They will be outdone on the one side by the far right who will out-patriot them every time and on the other by the left who will come up with more creative redistributive policies,\" he said.", "description": "Millions of families feel for the first time that the party ruling Poland cares about their dignity.", "authors": ["Adam Easton", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/043D/production/_109258010_hi057280427.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
