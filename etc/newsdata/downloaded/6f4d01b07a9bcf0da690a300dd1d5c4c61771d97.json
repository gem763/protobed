You\u2019ve got to admit there\u2019s never a dull moment when the glue guns and materials start flying around the workroom.\n\nTasked with creating a couture look from remnants of a car boot sale, this wasn\u2019t going to be an easy feat, but the queens gave it their all with mostly successful results.\n\nBut couple that with the drama and the pressures of the show, and the competition is getting to a lot of the girls.\n\nHere\u2019s how we thought the girls did this episode \u2013 from top to bottom.\n\nCrystal is creeping up on the competition (Picture: BBC)\n\nCrystal\n\nCrystal may well be the black horse of this competition \u2013 and her imagination and sewing skills truly came in handy this episode.\n\nHer calm voice demeanour, compared to the rest of the queens, has made her fall back in the spotlight fight over the past few challenges for us \u2013 but not anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a sexy Victorian look, complete with accessories, made out of beach balls and curtains was breathtaking.\n\nPlus her sassy confessionals are well and truly winning us over.\n\nThrow in the fact she\u2019s literally willing to show her balls on camera to win a challenge by flipping backwards on a maypole, and she got our vote.\n\nDivina finally got the boost she needed to get her head in the game (Picture: BBC)\n\nDivina De Campo\n\nYes, Divina! This girl finally showed us what she made of with a unique and incredible power suit that looked like David Bowie had launched a circus.\n\nAnd by only using those gastly bags your nan has for her shopping too. We stan a thrifty queen.\n\nDivina has made no secret of struggling to feel like she fits in on the competition, and has been unnecessarily harsh on herself over the past few weeks.\n\nBut now she\u2019s the owner of a RuPeter badge, she\u2019s earned it, and now she\u2019s set herself as someone to truly look out for.\n\nPlus her giggle is infectious and her comments in the confessionals are head and shoulders above the others.\n\nLet\u2019s just hope now she\u2019s got the confidence boost she needed, she can keep it up.\n\nVivienne\u2019s tape player look is everything (Picture: BBC)\n\nThe Vivienne\n\nThe Vivienne really knows how to play to her strengths, and once again her look was one of the stand-outs of the runway.\n\nShe\u2019s also got a great personality that\u2019s both shady and endearing in the workroom and the confessionals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s clear she knows she\u2019s fabulous, and offered help to the other queens when they needed it because she\u2019s confident enough to know that a few words of advice aren\u2019t going to sink her.\n\nEven when she\u2019s being straight down the line to the point of savage, she\u2019s not wrong and it never seems malicious.\n\nSo while she wasn\u2019t centre stage today, she made sure that she wasn\u2019t forgotten.\n\nThe Vivienne\u2019s becoming a real contender for the crown at this rate, and it could take something massive to throw her off her game.\n\nBaga\u2019s \u2018wire pubes\u2019 look was forgettable but her comedy is keeping her up top (Picture: BBC)\n\nBaga Chipz\n\nBaga was playing it safe this week, and with the \u2018safe is good enough for me\u2019 comment to Blu backstage, she blinking knew it as well.\n\nBut there\u2019s no denying that Baga is entertaining and knows her schtick well enough to know when she can get through on comedy value.\n\nHer confessionals are hands down the best of the lot, she\u2019s self-depricating and not too shady on the other queens, but her quips are absolute fire.\n\nSeeing her Thelma and Louise friendship with The Viv as well is nice to see when everyone else is feeling so low about how they\u2019re doing.\n\nHowever, if there\u2019s another sewing challenge coming up, she might find herself in a bit more trouble when there\u2019s less girls to hide behind in the rankings.\n\nBlu is maintaining her streak as a solidly safe queen (Picture: BBC)\n\nBlu Hydrangea\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyone who is shady to RuPaul and is charming enough to get away with it is someone worth paying attention to.\n\nShe\u2019s also finally settling into the confessionals so they don\u2019t sound so practiced (though every now and again, they kinda do).\n\nPeople are underestimating her for her age, and that\u2019s a dangerous thing to do, but she\u2019s using it to try and get under the skin of the others \u2013 particularly Divina.\n\nHowever, her final look from tonight\u2019s episode was a little forgettable compared to the others.\n\nBlu is remaining a solidly safe queen, but she\u2019s going to have to do something to get herself out of the middle.\n\nCheryl is going show but is beginning to show her potential (Picture: BBC)\n\nCheryl Hole\n\nCheryl\u2019s frustrating because she is so charming and yet you can tell she\u2019s not giving it her all just yet.\n\nIt might be because she\u2019s getting into her own head, or is getting so worried about the cameras that she\u2019s not fully in it with the show.\n\nShe got a bit of a shocker after the queens quizzed her on her behaviour backstage last week, and may be settling down a little.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s used to being centre of attention (hey, it\u2019s the central part of being a drag queen after all!) and isn\u2019t happy when she\u2019s not.\n\nSo throw her in a room with other people fighting for that camera time, and she\u2019s feeling a bit jarred.\n\nSum Ting needs to learn to take advice (Picture: BBC)\n\nSum Ting Wong\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s nothing more infuriating than a queen ignoring from advice.\n\nYou can understand maybe ignoring other girls in the competition for risk of potential sabotage or making you doubt, but ignoring Mama Ru?\n\nGirl, she\u2019s literally the one in charge of your fate \u2013 pay. attention.\n\nHer outfit was actually 90% of the way there \u2013 the 10% being the shirt or corset that should\u2019ve gone under the business suit.\n\nVinegar needs to give herself more credit (Picture: BBC)\n\nVinegar Strokes\n\nOh Vinegar, she really was a light in the work room, but she fell into the classic \u2018I can\u2019t sew\u2019 trap and got into her head too much.\n\nAfter spending too much time dawdling over what to do, she didn\u2019t have enough time to make what she finally came up with.\n\nAs a result, the execution of the outfit felt rushed, and it sealed her fate at the bottom.\n\nMore: RuPauls' Drag Race UK
