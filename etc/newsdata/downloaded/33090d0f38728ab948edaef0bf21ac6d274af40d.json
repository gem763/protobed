Police fired multiple rounds of tear gas at the Wong Tai Sin, Sha Tin, Tsuen Wan and Tuen Mun areas as protesters hurled gas bombs, bricks and other objects in their direction.\n\nPolice said protesters used corrosive fluid in Tuen Mun, injuring officers and some reporters.\n\nThe city was already under tight security, and more subway stations were shuttered as the violence spread.\n\n\"Today we are out to tell the Communist Party that Hong Kong people have nothing to celebrate,\" said activist Lee Cheuk-yan. \"We are mourning that in 70 years of Communist Party rule, the democratic rights of people in Hong Kong and China are being denied. We will continue to fight.\"\n\nMany shopping malls across Hong Kong were shut amid fears of chaos. Posters in the city called for the Oct. 1 anniversary to be marked as \"A Day of Grief.\"\n\nDressed in a black T-shirt and dark jeans, 40-year-old Bob Wong said his clothing expressed \"mourning\" over \"the death of Hong Kong's future.\"\n\nBlack-clad Yvonne Ng, 67, fumed over the arrest of many young people in the months-long protests. \"We're not celebrating National Day,\" she said as she ambled through the Causeway Bay shopping district.\n\nAnti-government protesters march in Wan Chai district.

An annual fireworks display had been called off two weeks ago.\n\nPolice lined up to separate the demonstrators and counter-protesters, but some minor scuffles ensued.

Cheung was representing the city's leader, Carrie Lam, who led a delegation to Beijing to join National Day festivities there.\n\nCheung said Beijing fully supports the \"one country, two systems\" framework that gives Hong Kong freedoms and rights not enjoyed on the mainland. The system was implemented when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The protests began in early June over a now-shelved extradition bill that activists say was an example of how those promises have been eroding.\n\nPolice warned Monday that hard-line protesters may engage in extreme acts that are \"one step closer to terrorism,\" such as killing police officers, posing as police officials to kill civilians and large-scale arson, including at gas stations. Activists ridiculed the assertion as a scare tactic.", "description": "Riot police have fired tear gas to disperse pro-democracy protesters in several districts in Hong Kong amid multiple rallies challenging the Chinese Communist Party as it marks its 70th year of rule.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5303862.1569916868!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/china-anniversary-hongkong.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
