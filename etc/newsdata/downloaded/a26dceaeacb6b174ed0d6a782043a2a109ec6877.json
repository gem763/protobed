Those still aren\u2019t great odds, however. \u201cWe remain skeptical for now,\u201d Katz said in a note before the House vote, though he added that the chances could get better \u201cif we see meaningful signals from the Senate in the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nThe bill aims to give clarification to banks and credit unions that serve cannabis companies with, for instance, business accounts for bill paying. Currently, financial institutions face legal problems because marijuana remains illegal on the federal level, even as more states legalize it. Lobbyists have emphasized that many cannabis businesses end up \u201cunbanked\u201d and operating largely in cash, and that makes them targets for robberies and other crimes.\n\nSee: Cannabis company\u2019s CEO says being unbanked meant paying $3 million tax bill in cash\n\nAnd read: Cannabis companies have secret formulas to determine when the U.S. may allow pot sales\n\nInfluential Republican Sen. Mike Crapo gave some hope to the SAFE Banking Act\u2019s supporters earlier this month, as the Senate Banking Committee chairman told Politico that he wanted to hold a committee vote before the year\u2019s end on a cannabis banking bill. There are no additional details on the potential timing for such a vote, said a spokeswoman for the Idaho lawmaker on Monday. Crapo had sounded noncommittal on the issue at a July hearing.\n\nThe SAFE Banking Act \u201chas been sweetened for Republicans,\u201d Katz said. One provision would prevent the return of Operation Choke Point, an Obama-era program that Crapo mentioned at the July hearing and that involved investigating banks for doing business with payday lenders and firearms dealers. Another new provision aims to protect financial firms that serve the hemp industry, which is a force in Kentucky, the home state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nBut McConnell continues to look like he could serve as a big roadblock to the bill. He described marijuana last year as hemp\u2019s \u201cillicit cousin which I choose not to embrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a line of thinking that McConnell could go along with a pot banking bill to help Republicans in the 2020 elections,\u201d Katz said. \u201cThe tough re-election prospects of Republican Sen. Cory Gardner [a co-sponsor of the bill] of marijuana-friendly Colorado are often cited. But the benefit to Republicans, especially in the West and South, of supporting a bill that\u2019s at least superficially pro-marijuana, is debatable.\u201d\n\nAt the other end of the political spectrum, the bill had faced opposition ahead of Wednesday\u2019s House vote from several progressive groups, such as the Center for American Progress, the American Civil Liberties Union and others. In a letter to top House Democrats, the groups criticized the efforts to advance a bill that just addresses banking issues, but does not help \u201ccommunities who have felt the brunt of prohibition,\u201d yet have been \u201cshut out\u201d of the growing industry. Their concerns didn\u2019t end up stopping the House from passing the measure.\n\nEven with the SAFE Banking Act set to get the House\u2019s OK, Height Capital Markets analysts said in a note before that chamber\u2019s vote that they \u201cmaintain our less than 25% odds that cannabis legislation is enacted during the 116th Congress.\u201d Other analysts are more upbeat on the bill\u2019s prospects. This week\u2019s vote \u201cwill pressure the Senate to pass similar legislation, and the SAFE Act should become law before the 2020 election,\u201d said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group, in a note.\n\nWednesday\u2019s vote happened under a suspension of House rules that limited debate and meant that two-thirds of the lawmakers present and voting needed to back the measure. The vote tally was announced as 321 in favor vs. 103 against.\n\nCheck out: Cannabis Watch \u2014 All of MarketWatch\u2019s coverage of cannabis companies\n\nAnd see: Cannabis industry\u2019s lobbying on track to hit a new record\n\nMany players in the cannabis industry say banking-related legislation will become law at some point in the next few years, even if 2019 doesn\u2019t bring the action that they hope to see.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fairly confident that either the SAFE Act or STATES Act will be passed,\u201d said Rob DiPisa, co-chair of law firm Cole Schotz\u2019s Cannabis Law Group. \u201cI think the industry has come too far. The cat\u2019s out of the bag, and it\u2019s not going to disappear, so banking needs to happen.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u2018Don\u2019t smoke the Kool-Aid,\u2019 analyst says in sober note on the cannabis sector\n\nAlso see: Republicans and Democrats agree at landmark hearing that U.S. marijuana laws are a mess\n\nThe STATES Act \u2014 whose full name is the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act \u2014 would create protections for U.S. states that have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use. Another measure, the Marijuana Justice Act, would go further, ending the federal prohibition of the drug and expunging the records of people who have served time for marijuana use and possession.\n\nPot stocks, as tracked by the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ, +0.68% , have lost 44% over the past 12 months, while the broad S&P 500 index SPX, +0.62% has gained 2%.\n\nMarketWatch\u2019s Ciara Linnane contributed to this report.\n\nThis report was first published on Sept. 24, 2019.", "description": "The Democratic-controlled House on Wednesday passed a bill protecting banks that work with the marijuana industry, but some analysts are continuing to warn...", "authors": ["Victor Reklaitis", "Money", "Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR905_mariju_ZG_20190923171302.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
