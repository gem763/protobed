[SHAUN CURRY/AFP]\n\nLONDON - Raising the minimum legal age for betting and boosting education could be effective tools to tackle the scourge of problem gambling among children in Britain, say industry insiders.\n\nThe figures are stark.\n\nThe Gambling Commission, which licenses and regulates gambling, estimates that 55,000 children aged 11-16 have a gambling problem, with 450,000 gambling regularly.\n\nThe National Health Service, or NHS, this week launched a gambling addiction service for children and young adults.\n\nNHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has condemned the \"fraction\" spent by the industry on helping customers and their families deal with the direct consequences of addiction compared with the amount spent on advertising and marketing.\n\n\"The NHS should not be left to pick up the pieces,\" he said. \"Gambling and internet firms have a responsibility to their users as well as their shareholders and should do their utmost to prevent rather than cash in on obsessive or harmful behavior.\"\n\nThe comment came at a time of growing concern that online gaming sites and targeted adverts are fueling the problem.\n\nWilliam Woodhams, chief executive of Fitzdares bookmakers, said he feared problem gambling among all ages was far worse than anyone imagined.\n\n\"It is slightly like the opioid epidemic in the United States. You do not realize it is an epidemic as it happens privately,\" he said at the Betting on Sports conference in London.\n\n\"We cannot reverse technology (the apps) we have put in the market and unfortunately bookies do seem to find legislation heavy-handed and want to self-legislate. But they have made so much money it is a tricky place to be in.\"\n\nWoodhams believes raising the age limit from 18 is a logical step.\n\n\"My view on principle is you should not bet until you are 21. We (Fitzdares) are probably the only ones who restrict it to 21 and over,\" he said.\n\n\"My opinion is a student loan or money from your first job should not be spent on gambling.\n\n\"However, spending money on sport needs another level of thought - and maybe I am being rude to 18-year-olds - but I think 21 is the right age.\n\n\"I was betting aged 16 but got my fingers burned and stopped and learned my lesson that way.\"\n\nLimited impact\n\nWoodhams also believes that bookies talking about the perils of betting has a limited impact.\n\n\"The advertisements on TV educating you on betting are being paid for by bookmakers,\" he said. \"I would not ask Johnnie Walker how much I should drink.\"\n\nIn its report last year, the Gambling Commission said 14 percent of those between 11 and 16 years old had spent their own money on gambling in the previous week - compared to 13 percent who had drunk alcohol.\n\nTypes of betting included private bets with friends, National Lottery scratch cards and slot machines.\n\nThe bishop of St Albans, Alan Smith, has described the number of young gamblers as a \"generational scandal\" and demanded the dangers be taken seriously.\n\nGraham Weir, founder and CEO of Safer Gambling Solutions, which advises firms on reducing gambling-related harm, believes education is the key.\n\n\"It is potentially a problem area but also a big opportunity,\" he said after chairing a panel on the topic of leadership in safer gambling at the CasinoBeats Summit.\n\n\"I believe passionately it would be a good thing to do if we can educate the next generation of gamblers that you will not get rich on the back of it and it is neither sexy nor glamorous, and on the dangers of it.\"\n\nWeir, who was previously group director of responsible gambling for bookmaking giants Ladbrokes Coral, said educational establishments also have a responsibility.\n\n\"On the school curriculum we teach them about sex, making money and taking drugs but for me it should be part of the curriculum at school and for young adults going to university as part of freshers' week.\n\nAgence France-presse", "description": "Raising the minimum legal age for betting and boosting education could be effective tools to tackle the scourge of problem gambling among children in Britain, say industry insiders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/10/5d9e87d7a310cf3e97a0667f.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
