The color of the band is black, and neon-colored, 8-bit electric bolts and Pokeballs are dotted all over it. On the keeper, which holds the loose part of the band in place, the number \u201c0:25\u201d is written, to commemorate the special collaboration.\n\nThe watch face is designed much more simply in solid black, but those who grew up playing the original Game Boy games will recognize the frame around the digital display, which looks like the border of the menus of the first Pokemon and games. That gives it a distinctive \u201990s feel that many will love. Plus, the Pokemon logo is also proudly displayed at the top.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all of the Pokemon homage; the screen displays an 8-bit Pikachu when the backlight is turned on, and the stainless steel back of the watch has the Pikachu\u2019s backside engraved on it.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not only stylish but also has the full capabilities of other Baby-G watches, including water and shock resistance, a stopwatch, calendar, time zones, and many other useful features. It will retail for 13,000 yen in Japan and $110 in the U.S., and will be available wherever Baby-G watches are sold. If you\u2019re kind enough to not keep this cool watch to yourself and are planning to give it to someone else, it also comes in a sweet Pokeball case and a gift box that matches the watch\u2019s design, so you won\u2019t even have to worry about wrapping it.\n\nSource, images: Baby-G Press Release*\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Shockingly expensive Pok\u00e9mon watch costs more than most people make in several years\n\n-- New Sailor Moon collaboration goods from Baby-G and Samantha Vega feature gorgeous details\n\n-- Pok\u00e9mon Sun & Moon Games\u2019 Trailer Reveals Version-Exclusive Pok\u00e9mon, Trainer Customization\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/16/casio-baby-g-teams-up-with-pokemon-for-special-limited-edition-anniversary-pikachu-watch/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "Casio\u2019s casual watch line, Baby-G, has been making not only functional but stylish watches featuring all of our favorite things, including \"Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service\" and \"Sailor Moon.\" This line of sporty watches is now celebrating its 25th anniversary, and who better to celebrate with than the ever-popular Pokemon who happens to occupy the 25th spot in\u2026", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/f4/ac/1e3570ca362ab5ad3faab3b1172398e34c0b/baby-g-pikachu5.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
