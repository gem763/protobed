Models wore black Western hats, transparent pointed-toe heels, cowboy boots and graphic tees saying, \u201cI will not, not be rich\u201d and \u201cJordan Smith Hoedown.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about female empowerment,\u201d Smith said Sunday at his show. \u201cOne of my favorite films is \u2018Showgirls,\u2019 so I just wanted to pull just these different elements of just what sexy represents and what that looks like.\u201d\n\nSmith said he wants to promote \u201ca strong sense of identity, which basically is just unapologetic.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now we are living in such a world where it\u2019s sportswear - you put on a suit and white sneakers and that\u2019s considered sportswear, which I\u2019m OK with,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think as a designer right now in the market, I want to really bring back sexy and I just feel like that\u2019s missing.\u201d\n\nTrevor Jackson, who co-stars in \u201cgrown-ish,\u201d tried to help on that front during his first runway walk, donning a men\u2019s blouse in a sheer tiger stripe design.\n\n\u201cThis is kind of like, hoedown, kind of the style,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI\u2019m super excited. Everybody is so beautiful and the clothes are so dope and I can\u2019t wait for the people to see it.\u201d\n\nModels Slick Woods, Halima Aden and Winnie Harlow also walked in the show.\n\nAden, who also walked for Smith last year, is a huge admirer.\n\n\u201cI love how he\u2019s like, he still dresses me modestly but it\u2019s young, it\u2019s cool, it\u2019s edgy,\u201d said Aden, who is Muslim. \u201cI always feel like a rock star.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "LaQuan Smith turned to cowboys and bikers for spring-summer inspiration, bringing a sexy edge to his designs at New York Fashion Week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ragan Clark"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/ny_fashion_week-laquan_smith_53698_c17-0-1418-817_s1770x1032.jpg?2017bb957ece7e3f2e157224f26f64653baa5b20", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
