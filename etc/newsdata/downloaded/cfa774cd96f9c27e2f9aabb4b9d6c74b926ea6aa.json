The inquiry was part of a far-reaching investigation into the program by the department, which under Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, has become increasingly aggressive in going after perceived anti-Israel bias in higher education.\n\nThat focus appears to reflect the views of an agency leadership that includes a civil rights chief, Kenneth L. Marcus, who has made a career of pro-Israel advocacy and has waged a yearslong campaign to delegitimize and defund Middle East studies programs that he has criticized as rife with anti-Israel bias.\n\nIn this case, the department homed in on what officials saw as a program that focused on the region\u2019s Muslim population at the expense of its religious minorities. In the North Carolina program\u2019s outreach to elementary and secondary school students, the department said, there was \u201ca considerable emphasis placed on the understanding the positive aspects of Islam, while there is an absolute absence of any similar focus on the positive aspects of Christianity, Judaism or any other religion or belief system in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nToo few of the Duke-UNC programs focused on \u201cthe historic discrimination faced by, and current circumstances of, religious minorities in the Middle East, including Christians, Jews, Baha\u2019is, Yazidis, Kurds, Druze and others,\u201d the department said.\n\nWith its actions, the department entered the debate over Israel and Palestinians that has roiled campuses around the country.\n\nThe department\u2019s action \u201cshould be a wake-up call,\u201d said Miriam Elman, an associate professor at Syracuse University and executive director of the Academic Engagement Network, which opposes the boycott-Israel movement that has animated campus activism across the country. She added, \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is, \u2018If you want to be biased and show an unbalanced view of the Middle East, you can do that, but you\u2019re not going to get federal and taxpayer money.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPalestinian rights groups accused the Education Department of intimidation and infringing on academic freedom.\n\n\u201cThey really want to send the message that if you want to criticize Israel, then the federal government is going to look very closely at your entire program and micromanage it to death,\u201d said Zoha Khalili, a staff lawyer at Palestine Legal, one such group. The department\u2019s intervention, she added, \u201csends a message to Middle Eastern studies programs that their continued existence depends on their willingness to toe the government line on Israel.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to university officials, the assistant secretary for postsecondary education, Robert King, wrote that programs run by the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies appeared to be misaligned with the federal grant they had received. Title VI of the Higher Education Act awards funding to colleges \u201cestablishing, strengthening and operating a diverse network of undergraduate foreign language and area or international studies centers and programs.\u201d\n\nThe Education Department \u201cbelieves\u201d the Middle Eastern studies consortium \u201chas failed to carefully distinguish between activities lawfully funded under Title VI and other activities\u201d that are \u201cplainly unqualified for taxpayer support,\u201d King wrote.\n\nThe letter, published this week in the Federal Register, said that the consortium\u2019s records on the number of students it had enrolled in foreign language studies \u2014 a cornerstone of the federal grant program \u2014 were unclear and that \u201cit seems clear foreign language instruction and area studies advancing the security and economic stability of the United States have taken \u2018a back seat\u2019 to other priorities.\u201d\n\nKing wrote that the department believed other offerings, such as a conference focused on \u201clove and desire in modern Iran\u201d and another focused on Middle East film criticism, \u201chave little or no relevance to Title VI.\u201d The department wrote the consortium\u2019s programming also \u201cappears to lack balance.\u201d", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The Education Department has ordered Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to remake the Middle East studies program run jointly by the two schools after concluding that it was offering students a biased curriculum that, among other complaints, did not present", "authors": ["Erica L.
