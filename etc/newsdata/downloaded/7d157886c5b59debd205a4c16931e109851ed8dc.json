It is believed oestrogen can stimulate some cancer cells to grow, normally in the breast or cervix.\n\nBut for most women contraceptive pills are safe and come with a very low risk of serious complications.\n\nThe bakery assistant underwent a gruelling five-hour long surgery to remove the mass and half of her organ in January\n\nMrs Luck (pictured with husband Lydon, 30) started taking the Pill at the age of 15 to help ease her painful periods.\n\nShe had been taking it for three weeks out of the month with a seven-day break in between, on the advice of her doctor\n\nMrs Luck said: 'I was originally recommended to start the Pill to help with my very heavy and painful periods and, as it helped, I continued to take it for another 10 years.\n\n'In 2014, I was told I could take my pill without a seven-day break - but it wasn't until four years later that I felt the side effects.\n\n'In November 2018, I started to feel very exhausted so my doctor told me to have a routine blood test as I hadn't for about six years.'\n\n'And this is when it showed I had abnormal liver function and elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels.' High levels can indicate liver disease.\n\nShe added: 'So I went for an ultrasound scan to check my liver which showed a large mass.\n\n'I was then given a CT scan, biopsy and PET scan which told me I had a tumour which was 16cm-long, 12cm-down and 5cm-wide, but luckily it wasn't cancerous.\n\n'Due to the size of the tumour there was a chance of a rupture at any time, so I came off the pill, as the doctors were certain this is what caused it, in hopes that it would shrink my tumour - which it did - but not enough for them to operate.'\n\nBut, after reading online in 2014 that she could stay on the medication for a full month without going through the misery of a painful induced period, she changed her habits\n\nDoctors initially worried the tumour would cause Mrs Luck to be unable to carry a child. But following surgery they are now confident that she and Lydon will be able to start a family next year\n\n'Luckily, I was able to have the surgery last month, on September 25, as I told the hospital I wanted to start a family as soon as possible and the tumour was getting in the way.\n\n'The surgery removed over half of my liver - it was mostly tumour, but some healthy liver was also removed - and now I am waiting for my scar to heal properly.'\n\nDoctors initially worried the tumour would cause Mrs Luck to be unable to carry a child.\n\nBut following surgery they are now confident that she and husband, Lydon, 30, will be able to start a family next year.\n\nShe said: 'I would be able to conceive but not carry the baby whilst the tumour was in there as the baby would push on it as it grew and it would rupture.\n\n'Also the pregnancy hormones would begin to feed the tumour so it would start to grow again.\n\n'I cannot start a family for at least a year due to the location of the scar, but in a way I was \"lucky\" that it was my liver, as it will be busy regenerating and should be fully regrown in six months.\n\n'I am scheduled for another scan to confirm it has gone, but my surgeon seemed quite confident he had managed to remove it all.\n\n'For me, it's important to share my story because a lot of people know the common side effects of taking the pill but not the massive dangers it can have.'", "description": "Tasha Luck from Hastings, East Sussex, had the mass removed from her organ in January after feeling fatigued and sick for months.
