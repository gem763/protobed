It is genuinely funny as, in the lobby of an Amsterdam hotel, he tries in vain to collapse his 6ft 4in frame into something resembling Big Ron. The Dutchman\u2019s accent and intonation, however, are spot on as we discuss his final few months under Atkinson at Nottingham Forest in 1998-99, when the club was relegated from the Premier League. They have not been back since.\n\nSteve Ogrizovic: \u2018I enjoyed the police. I was good at clearing bars and clubs\u2019 Read more\n\n\u201cDespite being bottom of the league, Ron had just appeared in a Carling advert as some sort of clueless medieval king who had just discovered football,\u201d Van Hooijdonk says. \u201cI remember one training session afterwards where I was pissed off with the whole situation and I cursed loudly. Ron replied: \u2018If you don\u2019t like it, why don\u2019t you fuck off?\u2019 So I did, and as I walked off the training pitch I shouted: \u2018The only reason they asked you on that beer ad is because you are the biggest pub manager in the country.\u2019\n\n\u201cLater that afternoon, Ron called me at home to come and see him in his office. He was smiling and said: \u2018I liked your joke. A couple more games are left, you can leave after that, just give your best.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe laughed it off. Ron was a people person and I can imagine him doing better with the right group of players. He was funny, warm, even if his tactical approach was the same as Dave Bassett\u2019s. And all the players were pissing themselves when he got into the wrong dugout in his first game in charge.\u201d\n\nIt proved a rare moment of lightness in a turbulent time for Forest and Van Hooijdonk, who had fired the club to the 1997-98 First Division title the previous season with 34 goals, scored at the World Cup for the Netherlands and then spent the first few months of the next season on strike after failing to secure a move away from Forest.\n\nKarel Poborsky: \u2018They put me into a coma. All my face muscles were paralysed\u2019 Read more\n\n\u201cThe thing that started all that was after the World Cup Newcastle and Ruud Gullit came in with a \u00a37m bid, twice what Forest had paid,\u201d Van Hooijdonk says. \u201cBut Bassett told the papers my price was \u00a310m. Ten million! In 1998, that\u2019s like putting a price tag on a bottle of water and asking for \u00a325. Officially it\u2019s for sale but it\u2019s not for sale.\u201d\n\nVan Hooijdonk would not play in the first team until November, eventually reintegrated by a now\u2011desperate Bassett, who would be sacked and replaced by Atkinson two months later. Van Hooijdonk is withering in his assessment of the former Wimbledon manager.\n\n\u201cBassett\u2019s training was primitive. We played five-a-side most of the time. We would do drills where the goalkeeper, Dave Beasant, was playing up front. Bassett wasn\u2019t there most of the time. Then, on a Friday, he would turn up. Before matches we would just go to an Italian restaurant opposite the City Ground. We could order what we wanted: chicken wings, carbonara with loads of sauce, french fries, whatever.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pierre van Hooijdonk played 46 times for Holland in a golden age of Dutch strikers. Photograph: Michel Porro/The Observer\n\nBassett was not the only obstacle for Van Hooijdonk. Some players publicly made their feelings known about the Dutchman, and in one game refused to celebrate one of his goals. While Van Hooijdonk was on strike, Steve Stone said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t give a shit what Pierre does next\u201d and said the striker was not welcome in the dressing room. \u201cWhy was it that no foreign player at Forest was interviewed?\u201d Van Hooijdonk says. \u201cTo this day, there is not one foreign player from my time at Forest that has said something bad about me.\n\n\u201cWhen I returned that November, I called a meeting with the players in the dressing room, explained the reasons I stayed away in bullet-point form and asked if anyone had any questions. That was their time to say something, face to face. All the guys who said something when I was away stayed quiet. Only one person, Geoff Thomas, said he didn\u2019t agree with me. And I respected Geoff for that.\n\n\u201cPeople can say I went on strike but I believe nobody can say that as a colleague and a professional I was an asshole.\u201d\n\nForest were understandably reluctant to let Van Hooijdonk go. He was the club\u2019s best striker since Stan Collymore and Teddy Sheringham, a two-footed, world-class set-piece specialist, and did not look out of place alongside Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Kluivert in an orange shirt. He eventually left for Vitesse Arnhem in the summer of 1999 for \u00a33.5m.\n\nHe had arrived at Forest from Celtic, with his spell in Glasgow also controversial. \u201cIn Scotland, every day the papers are on you, mad for Celtic and Rangers. But at Forest, it was not the same. I didn\u2019t miss the attention but you noticed the difference.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pierre van Hooijdonk helped Nottingham Forest gain promotion to the Premier League in 1997-98. Photograph: Ted Blackbrow/Daily Mail/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cIn Glasgow, I was easy to recognise: tall and dark. I got some trouble from Rangers fans; once at some traffic lights a boy opened my car door and spat at me. It sucked the energy out of me.\n\n\u201cI was single for six months there but didn\u2019t go out because I had to be careful. If I went to a concert, I would take a taxi and crouch down in the back seat as we went past the pubs. Even when I was playing for Fenerbahce with the Galatasaray fans or for Benfica with the Porto fans, the danger was never as bad.\u201d\n\nLothar Matth\u00e4us: \u2018With Putin I talked football, judo and Brexit' Read more\n\nVan Hooijdonk made an immediate impact for Celtic, scoring a famous 1994 Scottish Cup final winner \u2013 the club\u2019s first trophy for six years \u2013 and the next season would be the league\u2019s top scorer with 26 goals. Paolo Di Canio and Jorge Cadete would later join to form a frontline affectionately known as the Three Amigos.\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived at Celtic in 1994 I was not impressed with the quality,\u201d Van Hooijdonk says. \u201cBut when Andreas Thom joined, then Jorge and Paolo, the difference in level was unbelievable. It was a great partnership.\n\n\u201cJohn Collins had taken me to his home for dinner when I had joined, so when the other foreigners arrived I did the same. Andreas at the time was smoking cigarettes and so was my wife, so he felt safe at my home. He was from East Germany; they are a little bit different, more suspicious.\n\n\u201cPaolo also came round. At the \u201896 Olympics the volleyball final was between Holland and Italy. I said to him after training that he should come to my house to watch. It was my first time meeting him properly and I thought he was going to be relaxed, but he was on the floor, rolling around, screaming with passion at every point. Paolo was a funny guy \u2013 he once called a team meeting because Andreas had not passed the ball to him.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pierre Van Hooijdonk beats Dunfermline keeper Ian Westwater to score for Celtic in 1996. Photograph: Chris Bacon/PA Archive/PA Images\n\nDi Canio, Cadete and Van Hooijdonk would all leave Celtic in acrimony, with the Dutchman falling out with the chairman, Fergus McCann, over a new contract, declaring Celtic\u2019s offer of \u00a37,000 a week was \u201cenough for the homeless but not for an international striker\u201d in 1996.\n\nJohn Scales: \u2018I punched a hole in the wall when I had to leave Liverpool\u2019 Read more\n\n\u201cOur best players were on five\u2011figure sums per week and I was not,\u201d Van Hooijdonk says. \u201cMcCann said if I did well he would raise my salary. I became top scorer but he never offered me the same money as the others. I\u2019m a man of my word.\u201d\n\nVan Hooijdonk\u2019s goal record is astonishing: 335 in 551 games, including at least a goal every other game for seven clubs between 1991 and 2005. His pinnacle was the Uefa Cup triumph with an unfancied Feyenoord in 2002, alongside a young Robin van Persie. Van Hooijdonk scored in every knockout round, including two goals in the final (in Rotterdam) against Borussia Dortmund, one a trademark free-kick.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nRemarkably, at 49, Van Hooijdonk plays for a Sunday league team. He is still besotted by football and easy to talk to: about how he spent his pocket money as a kid on hiring a sports hall because it had a goal with a net, or about Harry Kane, or his 19-year-old son, Sydney van Hooijdonk, a striker for his hometown club, NAC Breda.\n\nArticulate and passionate, it is perhaps unsurprising he works as a TV pundit in the Netherlands. It allowed him to visit Glasgow last month for Feyenoord\u2019s match against Rangers, where he paid tribute to his former teammate Fernando Ricksen at Ibrox.\n\n\u201cI knew Fernando through the national team and could not miss out on the opportunity to show my respects,\u201d he says.\n\nIt seems some of the Glasgow confrontation has died down. \u201cSome Rangers fans even said hello to me.\u201d", "description": "The Dutch striker on his time at Nottingham Forest, Celtic and returning to Glasgow to pay tribute to Fernando Ricksen", "authors": ["Michael Butler"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f58d446778e11ab7d66ca74e3abbe20f1bb8fda8/0_293_3767_2261/master/3767.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3bcdc75de935b9d493774db0499d71ce", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
