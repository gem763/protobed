But you don\u2019t always have money to throw at the problem to quickly get decent furniture in your new place. So you play the back-and-forth email negotiation game with somebody on Gumtree, or pray you called dibs on a Freecycle offer before the rest of the neighbourhood chimes in.\n\nFast track your home furnishings search with this tip from bos-o on Reddit: Search for \u201cmoving sale\u201d on Facebook Marketplace.\n\nUnlike a regular, Marie Kondo-inspired garage sale or someone looking to unload just one item, moving sales are for the time-crunched.\n\nYou\u2019ll find people looking to get rid of things really quick, and it usually comes down to your offer versus them just dropping it at Goodwill... I\u2019ve been able to get great deals on a lot of stuff: secondhand IKEA, cookware, some nicer mid-century furniture, a Lasso Fan, Canon printer, shelves, etc\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for larger items, like a bed frame or a dining room table that seats eight, you\u2019ll need to plan ahead to ensure you have a large vehicle at the ready. Someone who\u2019s preparing to move will want to unload their stuff ASAP, and probably won\u2019t want to make a delivery to your home.\n\nBut the small cost of renting a truck or enlisting a friend who owns a large vehicle may be worth it for the savings offered by the moving sale. If, for instance, the seller has several IKEA furniture pieces in pristine condition, you can snag them for a discount \u2014 and they\u2019ve already assembled the items. That\u2019s a savings of both time and money.", "description": "If you\u2019re trying to furnish your home for little-to-no money, you quickly learn (maybe while using a plastic storage bin as a coffee table) that it can be a hassle.
