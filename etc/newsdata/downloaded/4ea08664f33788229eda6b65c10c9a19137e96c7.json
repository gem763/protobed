A major departure from that line of thinking came in 1984, when Francis Crick, known for his work on the structure of DNA, proposed that the attentional searchlight was controlled by a region deep in the brain called the thalamus, parts of which receive input from sensory domains and feed information to the cortex. He developed a theory in which the sensory thalamus acted not just as a relay station, but also as a gatekeeper\u2014not just a bridge, but a sieve\u2014stanching some of the flow of data to establish a certain level of focus.\n\nRead: The attention machine\n\nBut decades passed, and attempts to identify an actual mechanism proved less than fruitful\u2014not least because of how enormously difficult it is to establish methods for studying attention in lab animals.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop Michael Halassa, a neuroscientist at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He wanted to determine exactly how sensory inputs got filtered before information reached the cortex, to pin down the precise circuit that Crick\u2019s work implied would be there.\n\nHe was drawn to a thin layer of inhibitory neurons called the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), which wraps around the rest of the thalamus like a shell. By the time Halassa was a postdoctoral researcher, he had already found a coarse level of gating in that brain area: The TRN seemed to let sensory inputs through when an animal was awake and attentive to something in its environment, but it suppressed them when the animal was asleep.\n\nIn 2015, Halassa and his colleagues discovered another, finer level of gating that further implicated the TRN as part of Crick\u2019s long-sought circuit\u2014this time involving how animals select what to focus on when their attention is divided among different senses. In the study, the researchers used mice trained to run as directed by flashing lights and sweeping audio tones. They then simultaneously presented the animals with conflicting commands from the lights and tones, but also cued them about which signal to disregard. The mice\u2019s responses showed how effectively they were focusing their attention. Throughout the task, the researchers used well-established techniques to shut off activity in various brain regions to see what interfered with the animals\u2019 performance.\n\nAs expected, the prefrontal cortex, which issues high-level commands to other parts of the brain, was crucial. But the team also observed that if a trial required the mice to attend to vision, turning on neurons in the visual TRN interfered with their performance. And when those neurons were silenced, the mice had more difficulty paying attention to sound. In effect, the network was turning the knobs on inhibitory processes, not excitatory ones, with the TRN inhibiting information that the prefrontal cortex deemed distracting. If the mouse needed to prioritize auditory information, the prefrontal cortex told the visual TRN to increase its activity to suppress the visual thalamus\u2014stripping away irrelevant visual data.", "description": "Filtering out distractions might be more important for the brain than highlighting important information.", "authors": ["Jordana Cepelewicz"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/Quanta_Brain_Attention_Image/facebook.jpg?1569515205", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
