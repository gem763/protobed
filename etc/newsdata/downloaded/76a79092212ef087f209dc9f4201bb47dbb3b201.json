As Lorenzo Reyes details, the league's elite class is starting to crystalize. USA TODAY\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 Damien Wilson didn\u2019t even wait until question\u2019s end before he interjected.\n\n\u201cAwesome,\u201d the Chiefs linebacker told USA TODAY Sports after the Green Bay Packers\u2019 31-24 win. \u201cThem boys was lights out. They played absolutely amazing.\u201d\n\nThe Chiefs defense doled out praise along those lines to the Aaron Rodgers-Aaron Jones attack that outlasted relentless pressure from defenders like Wilson.\n\nBut Wilson\u2019s praise for boys playing lights out wasn\u2019t for Rodgers and his again-spectacular playmaking. It wasn\u2019t for the five-sack, 12-hit Whack-a-Rodgers effort to which Wilson contributed three hits and one sack. (Through the Packers\u2019 first seven games, Rodgers was hit an average of 4.2.)\n\nNo, Wilson\u2019s praise for absolutely amazing play was how he characterized backup quarterback Matt Moore\u2019s first start in place of reigning NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes. Teammates across the Chiefs locker room agreed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been in the league for a while, he\u2019s seen a lot of defenses and he knows a lot of calls,\u201d linebacker Anthony Hitchens told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why they brought him up.\u201d\n\nAdded tight end Travis Kelce: \u201cPlayed outstanding. The ball was right there every time I can think of.\u201d\n\nMORE: 32 things we learned from Week 8\n\nOPINION: Patriots have elite component -- and it's not Tom Brady\n\n4th & MONDAY: Our NFL newsletter always brings the blitz\n\nMatt Moore threw for 267 yards and two touchdowns against the Packers. (Photo: Jay Biggerstaff, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Chiefs lamented their third loss. But they didn\u2019t lament Moore\u2019s play.\n\nMoore last started a game in the NFL nearly two years ago, on Nov. 26, 2017. He last started a game he didn\u2019t turn the ball over in 2,884 days ago (a December 2011 win vs. Oakland). So sure, teammates insisted, Moore\u2019s veteran experience might have helped him learn the playbook, incorporate smoothly into Andy Reid\u2019s offense and spread around balls to Chiefs targets with poise.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t guarantee execution when replacing the league\u2019s reigning MVP in Patrick Mahomes (dislocated right kneecap). Moore\u2019s 24-of-36 night with 267 yards, two touchdowns, no turnovers and a 107.1 passer rating qualified as more than game management.\n\nTake his 29-yard touchdown to Kelce in the second quarter.\n\nMoore faked a handoff to Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill before lobbing a ball right toward the end zone where Kelce was headed. The play was one that the Chiefs had drawn up and practiced during the week\u2019s game prep. But the practice run hadn\u2019t generated as much pressure as Moore encountered when Packers defensive end Dean Lowry and outside linebacker Rashan Gary beat their blocks and readied to crush Moore.\n\nMatt Moore lofts the TD to Travis Kelce!

So the 35-year-old lobbed the pass to buy time for his tight end. It worked. The Chiefs were on the board after opening in a 14-point hole. They\u2019d score 17 unanswered before halftime, as Moore kept pace with Rodgers through three quarters.\n\nIn fact, entering the fourth, each team was at 17. Rodgers had completed 69 percent of throws (20-of-29) for 227 yards, one touchdown and a 103.7 passer rating. Moore had connected on 67 percent (18-of-27) for 209 yards, two scores and a 114.6 rating (Rodgers had taken four more sacks).\n\nThe Chiefs answered the Packers\u2019 five-play, 27-yard scoring drive with a 10-play, 75-yard march to the end zone of their own. But Rodgers and Aaron Jones\u2019 last stab \u2014 Rodgers to Jones in the backfield almost simultaneously with the snap, that Jones took 67 yards to the house \u2014 was one too many.\n\nChiefs coach Andy Reid on Packers QB Aaron Rodgers: \"A future Hall of Fame quarterback with a couple of Hall of Fame throws. I don't know how a couple of those got in there [but] the son of a got them in there.\"\n\n\n\n(\ud83d\udcf9: @NFL)pic.twitter.com/HwVNYp4TjD \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) October 28, 2019\n\nMoore hit Kelce on third-and-3 long enough to move the chains, but Packers cornerback Chandler Sullivan reached in front of Kelce and batted down the pass before the tight end could secure it. The Chiefs punted on fourth-and-3 and didn\u2019t get the ball back.\n\n\u201cAaron Rodgers just being Aaron Rodgers,\u201d Chiefs safety Tyrann Mathieu said simply.\n\nBut as Mahomes waited in the tunnel hallway outside the Chiefs' locker room with his brother and girlfriend, his teammates told reporters that Moore\u2019s performance reassured them for the one or two more games before Mahomes\u2019 return from rehab. Moore already identified areas in his footwork, throwing motion and pocket presence vs. the Packers that he wants to correct. He said he felt nervous, naturally, but not rusty. Another good sign: The Chiefs didn\u2019t need to simplify their game plan without Mahomes.\n\n\u201cHe was ready,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cHe spent a lot of time at it. We didn\u2019t hold a lot back and you can\u2019t against a team like this.\n\n\u201cHe stepped his game up. He wanted everything. He attacked it during the week and studied. Like I said, he did a respectable job.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
