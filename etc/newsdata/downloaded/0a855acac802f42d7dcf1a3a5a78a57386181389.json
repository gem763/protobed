The projected deficit would be the highest since 2009/10.\n\nIt is then expected to widen further, to 6.5% in 2020/21, the highest level since the Treasury started presenting the consolidated fiscal framework in 2002/03.\n\nGross government debt was projected to rise from an estimated 60.8% of GDP in the current fiscal year to 71.3% in 2022/23, the Treasury said.\n\n\"The consequence of not acting now would be gravely negative for South Africa,\" Mboweni said told parliament. \"Over time, the country would likely face mounting debt service costs and higher interest rates and may enter a debt trap.\"\n\nThe rand ZAR=D3 weakened more than 2% against the dollar, while government bond yields rose, with market participants sceptical that officials would follow through with lowering the public wage bill amid opposition over job cuts from labour unions and key allies of the governing African National Congress party.\n\n\"With unemployment already up at an all-time high, I'm not sure how they're going to get more people not to work and cut salaries. I'm not too sure where they're going to get their spending cuts from,\" said Wichard Cilliers, chief trader at TreasuryOne.\n\nESKOM REFORM\n\nJohn Ashbourne, Senior Emerging Markets Economist at Capital Economics, said the MTBPS was \"a painful admission that South Africa clearly faces a slowly unfolding fiscal crisis.\"\n\nRobust economic growth in South Africa hinges on saving power firm Eskom, which is drowning in 440 billion rand ($29.3 billion) of debt and struggling to keep the lights on as its creaking fleet of coal-fired plants buckle.\n\nThe finance minister said new cash flow support for state power utility Eskom would no longer be in the form of equity but loans.\n\nThe government has pledged to give Eskom more than 100 billion rand over the next two fiscal years, with additional aid spread over the next decade.\n\n\"Once I am convinced that the Eskom board and management has made an irrevocable commitment to implement government's decisions and there is enough progress, we will negotiate appropriate size of debt relief,\" Mboweni said.\n\nA government paper showed on Tuesday that South Africa planned a sweeping overhaul of its power sector by breaking up Eskom over the next three years and opening the industry up to more competition. utility unleashed a bout of nationwide blackouts earlier this month. This followed repeated power cuts in February and March, which dragged the economy into contraction and raised the likelihood of the country losing its last investment-grade credit rating from Moody's.\n\nMoody's is due to announce a ratings decision on Friday.\n\nTreasury said the risk of a sovereign credit downgrade had risen due to low growth and high debt.\n\nTreasury Director-General Dondo Mogajane said he could not speculate on the outcome of Moody's upcoming review.\n\n\"They might say we didn't go far enough, especially with the cuts in the state-owned enterprises budgets, because those are unsustainable moving forward,\" Mogajane told Reuters.\n\n($1 = 14.9949 rand)", "description": "UPDATE 2-South Africa sees budget deficit and debt soaring as economy flags", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/News_800x533_L_1558880565.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
