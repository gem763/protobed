Parents would need to come up with tuition fees\u2014an average of about $12,000 per child\u2014or else figure out alternative arrangements. It would be chaos. Some parents would zero out their savings; others would leave the workforce to care for their children, or rely on family members to do so. A gray market of cheap, low-quality options would pop up. Parents would be gripped by stress, and the kids would suffer the most.\n\nThis is not an imaginary situation; it\u2019s a reality for many families today, because child care is not a right. Yet even as this crisis has become national news, and Democratic candidates for president are offering competing solutions, the conversation still suffers from a lack of imagination. Even the boldest plans to address the problem don\u2019t acknowledge what\u2019s obvious to many Americans: Child care should not be simply \u201caffordable.\u201d It should be free and universal\u2014a common good just like K-12 schooling.\n\n\n\nThe difference between a common good and a public assistance program is the difference between the nearly $700 billion a year America spends on universal K-12 education and the roughly $10 billion a year America spends on subsidizing child care for lower-income families (and still only reaching less than 15 percent of that population). Common goods\u2014public schools, fire departments, roads, national defense\u2014are those items which are so socially beneficial we don\u2019t make the end user pay a dollar beyond their taxes. They are, instead, worthy recipients of what Thomas Jefferson called the \u201ccommon expense.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile recent proposals like the Child Care For Working Families Act and those put forth by candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Julian Castro are welcome, they all implicitly keep child care in the realm of public assistance. These proposals utilize the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 line of 7 percent of family income to define \u201caffordable\u201d child care (albeit with a sliding scale, so some lower-income families would pay nothing). Yet no one pays a maximum of 7 percent of their income to send their child to fourth grade, nor are there sliding scale fees for getting the fire department to come to one\u2019s house. Accepting the premise that child care is ultimately a private burden keeps the sector stuck where it\u2019s been for far too long\u2014in what historian Sonya Michel calls \u201cthe shadows of charity.\u201d\n\n", "description": "The Democrats want to increase public assistance for struggling parents, but child care should be free for all Americans.", "authors": ["Elliot Haspel"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/9c83e27b53d092704b412cc9eb15ba006d2b1ecb.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
