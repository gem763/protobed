The decision underscores the \u201cimpulsiveness\u201d and \u201cthe transactional, quid pro quo-ness of the president,\u201d she said.\n\nThat \u201ctransactional\u201d charge is based on the Trump family\u2019s multitude of continuing business entities and interests, all separated from the president \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 by the trust that now controls them. But the president is the beneficiary of that trust and two of his children have roles in it\u2026\n\nTrump and his family have long had business ties in and with Turkey, the most visible example being the Trump Towers Istanbul, which licenses the Trump name. The Trump Organization describes the buildings on its website as \u201ca landmark in the historic city of Istanbul\u201d and it is the organization\u2019s first and only office and residential tower in Europe, with offices, apartments and upscale shops. The Washington Post has reported that the organization was paid up to $10 million to put the Trump name on the two buildings.\n\nErdogan attended the opening ceremony of the office and residential towers in 2012 and Ivanka Trump tweeted a message thanking him for attending, although a photo of Erdogan at the ribbon cutting has been removed from his Facebook page.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nbcnews.Com Politics Trump-Impeachment-Inquiry"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
