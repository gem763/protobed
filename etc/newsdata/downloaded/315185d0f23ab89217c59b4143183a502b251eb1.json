One of them, Alabama, is not a surprise, given that the Tide are themselves a dynastic juggernaut.\n\nThe other is, surprisingly, Syracuse. Not one of college football\u2019s major powers, Syracuse is often not very good at football. Last weekend, they were shellacked 63-20 by unheralded Maryland.\n\nYet in October 2017 at the Carrier Dome, then-second-year coach Dino Babers\u2019s team knocked off the Tigers 27-24. It would be the Orange\u2019s fourth and final win of the season.\n\nUnderdogs still in 2018, an improved Orange team marched into Death Valley and nearly defeated Clemson again. Syracuse led for most of the game until the final 41 seconds, when Clemson\u2019s star running back Travis Etienne capped a comeback drive with a touchdown to give the Tigers a 27-23 win.\n\nAs Syracuse prepares to host Clemson again on Saturday, the rest of college football may wonder: What does Dino Babers know that other coaches don\u2019t? The answer may be tournament chess.\n\nLast year, Syracuse led Clemson before Tigers running back Travis Etienne scored in the final minute of the game.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, he said that playing chess on the clock taught him the value of speed, a principle he has since co-opted for his offense.\n\n\u201cOnce you hit the clock, if the opponent hasn\u2019t moved by the time the clock moves, you get to have two moves in a row, which is a huge advantage,\u201d said Babers of the board game. \u201cWe kind of play football that way.\u201d\n\nEver since his first season as a head coach at Eastern Illinois University in 2012, Babers\u2019s teams have played ridiculously fast, averaging 82.7 plays per game. By comparison, the median number of plays per game among teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision last season was 69.8.\n\nBefore Babers arrived at Syracuse in 2016, the Orange ran just 62.6 plays per game, 125th out of 130 FBS teams. In the new coach\u2019s first season, Syracuse averaged 80.8 plays per game. The offense has grown faster still, last year reaching 81.2 plays per game\u2014third most in FBS football.\n\n\u201cI think the tempo gives us an edge,\u201d said Babers. \u201cThe more plays you run the more opportunities you have to score points, and the more points you score you have a better opportunity to win.\u201d\n\nThat thinking runs counter to conventional wisdom in college football, where high tempo offenses are most commonly found at dominant programs. Teams that are not favored to win usually aim to run fewer plays, creating fewer chances to make mistakes that could turn into points for their opponents.\n\nThe best way to understand why Syracuse has been able to test Clemson is by dissecting the team\u2019s last meeting in 2018. Clemson\u2019s defensive line had overwhelmed opponents so thoroughly in its previous six contests that the Tigers\u2019 defense hadn\u2019t actually faced that many snaps, about 65 per game. Then came the \u2018Cuse, which ran 82 plays in just over 27 minutes of possession time -- 25 more plays than Clemson\u2019s offense completed, in five minutes and 42 seconds less time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to move as fast as we can and we\u2019re going to see if the other team, which hasn\u2019t been doing that for 12 games, can adjust to our style of play,\u201d said Babers.\n\nThe success of Syracuse\u2019s speedy offense hinges on two factors: how fast the slowest offensive lineman can move and whether the quarterback can manage the offense without huddling.\n\n\u201cOur offense is a racing car and we need a racing car driver making the tires sing,\u201d said Babers. \u201cEverything is based on the quarterback.\u201d\n\nDino Babers, right, chats with Orange quarterback Tommy DeVito.

The stamina of the offensive line is left to performance coach Sean Edinger, who runs an aggressive weightlifting regimen he first developed while working with the University of Missouri\u2019s up-tempo football team.\n\nWhen the two coaches first arrived in Syracuse in the spring of 2016, the level of cardiovascular fitness required to make it through practice shocked most of the roster. According to Babers, so many players vomited from exhaustion during the first few training sessions that the trash cans lining the field were nearly filled.\n\nGaroppolo said Babers\u2019s arrival at Eastern Illinois was greeted with a similar amount of bodily fluid. During the second day of spring practice in 2012, the quarterback remembered having to snap the ball moments after his center threw up on it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the pass was incomplete,\u201d said Garoppolo. \u201cThat was my first eye-opening moment to the offense.\u201d\n\nBy year four of the Babers era, Syracuse\u2019s roster is fitter and stronger than ever. According to coach, the only players with their heads in the trash cans are freshmen, who \u201cdon\u2019t count.\u201d\n\nWrite to Laine Higgins at laine.higgins@wsj.com", "description": "As Syracuse prepares to host Clemson on Saturday, the rest of college football may wonder: What does Orange coach Dino Babers know that other coaches don\u2019t?", "authors": ["Laine Higgins"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106254/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
