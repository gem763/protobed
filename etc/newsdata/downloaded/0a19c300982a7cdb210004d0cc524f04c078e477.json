Barratt also declared a special dividend of 17.3 pence.\n\nBarratt, founded in 1958 and headquartered in Coalville, sold 17,856 homes compared to 17,579 homes, last year.\n\nThe company also said its gross margin rose 22.8% compared to 20.7% reported last year, as it welcomed the government\u2019s extension of Help to Buy until 2023.\n\nBarratt reiterated that it expects to grow volumes towards the lower end of its medium term target range in 2020.", "description": "Britain's biggest housebuilder Barratt Developments Plc reported higher annual pretax profit on Wednesday, benefiting from increased margins and higher home sales in the face of a tough real estate market.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
