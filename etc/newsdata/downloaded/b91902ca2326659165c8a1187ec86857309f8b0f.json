The disbursement was originally set to be made this month.\n\nBut that has been thrown into disarray after a huge primary election defeat for business-friendly President Mauricio Macri last month sparked a crash in the peso, leading his government to impose capital controls to stem the rout.\n\nPopulist-leaning challenger Alberto Fernandez is now the front-runner to win the Oct. 27 election.\n\n\u201cThe Fund will not disburse more money until the presidential election in October,\u201d opined Gabriel Monzon, head of local consultancy Grupo Latina. \u201cThis will be an unexpected blow for the economy.\u201d\n\nAn IMF spokesman declined to comment for this story. When asked about risks to the program on Thursday, a spokesman said the IMF would not make a decision until Washington meetings with Argentine officials, planned for late September.\n\nSince the Aug. 11 primary defeat, Macri has blown out his IMF-agreed fiscal targets by upping welfare payments and cutting personal income and food taxes. He has staved off default for now, by extending the maturities on about $100 billion in debt.\n\n\u201cGiven the fragile debt situation... the Fund could be forgiven for not wanting to throw (more) good money after bad,\u201d developing markets advisory Tellimer said in a note.\n\nIt added the IMF was in a tough spot where it would not want to \u201crock the boat\u201d in a sensitive election period even though it should probably \u201cwalk away\u201d from its program with Argentina.\n\nA Treasury Ministry spokesman told Reuters it was \u201cconjecture\u201d for analysts to say the IMF would not make the disbursement on time. \u201cThe point is that with the re-profiling of the debt and the capital controls, there is no immediate need for these funds,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nThe IMF and debt defaults are a touchy subject in a country where many blame the Fund\u2019s austerity policies for setting the stage for a massive 2001 bond default and financial crisis that threw millions of middle-class Argentines into poverty.\n\nECONOMIC OUTLOOK DARKENS\n\nIMF staff are doing a review of Argentina\u2019s economic performance in the second-quarter of the year. Disbursements are usually linked to the successful completion of such reviews.\n\nThe tranche of funds - which follows $44 billion of the IMF program released so far - is linked in part to the evaluation by the Fund of the country\u2019s economy in the April-June period, in which Macri\u2019s government can argue their goals were well met.\n\nMuch has changed since then, however.\n\nInflation spiked in August when the peso lost a quarter of its value against the dollar. Bond prices hit record lows before recovering slightly after currency controls were imposed.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Argentine unions, small firms and activists march near Argentina's Congress to demand changes in President Mauricio Macri's economic policies, in Buenos Aires, Argentina April 4, 2019.

Inflation expectations for this year have jumped to 55%, with the economy now seen shrinking 2.5% in 2019, according to economists polled by the central bank.\n\nGustavo Neffa, an Argentine economic analyst at Research for Traders, also said he believed the release of the tranche would be delayed until after the election and the deal may be altered.\n\n\u201cI think they will wait to make the disbursement. The government outperformed its fiscal and monetary goals for the second quarter, but that\u2019s not enough,\u201d he said.", "description": "The International Monetary Fund has a tough choice to make in Argentina: Unlock over $5 billion in funds under the country's loan deal as the government strains to stave off default, or hold the money back and risk sparking more market panic.", "authors": ["Hugh Bronstein", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429515157&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1XJ", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
