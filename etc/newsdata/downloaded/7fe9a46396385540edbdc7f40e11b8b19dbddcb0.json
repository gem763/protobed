I'd like to start by, oh yes, Sajid, I, Boris McCluskey, Father of the Chapel, recognise the union treasurer.\"\n\n\"Are you saying we are NUMNUTS?\"\n\n\"Are we, are we? Speak for yourself, brother! Mine are very sensitive, particularly in the presence of fruity wot-nots! Fwu-fwu-FWAH. Now, we've a lot of business to get through, a veritable cornucopia of legislation outlined in the Queen's Speech not 10 days ago, and which I now propose that this union completely ignore.\"\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg raises a hand. \"FoC, having personally been a big fan of the Queen ever since I started wearing her grandfather's suits, may I raise the not-inconsiderable issue of just how pissed off that venerable lady would be about this, especially as we have already quite seriously annoyed her, what with the lying, illegality, and using her as a political pawn to further our own quite beastly ends?\"\n\n\"No, no, Brother Mogg, perhaps as the grandson of a truck driver you don't realise, but as the descendant of Bavarian nobles I can assure you the whole reason we were all sent off to boarding school was to harden us against normal human emotion and behavioural norms, so being rude to little old ladies is entirely A-OK with the status quo, vis-\u00e0-vis the right of people like us to do whatever the bloody hell we want. Speaking of which, the downing of tools. Now, we've been extremists for a while but taking strike action is something pretty new to most of us, so I have asked one of our comrades with experience of union militancy to tell us how this works. The floor is yours, Brother Gove.\"\n\n\"Um, thank you. Well, um, the first thing to bear in mind when taking strike action is that this means that not doing what you were doing has to make things noticeably worse. And, um, seeing as we weren't governing anyway, doing some more not governing might not make people come around to our way of thinking.\"\n\n(Image: Dan Kitwood)\n\n\"Cripes. Well, Brother Gove, what do you suggest? What did you do when you went on strike as a reporter at the Aberdeen Press & Journal in, er, 1989?\"\n\n\"Well, um, we found it quite useful to establish a picket line and pose for photographs.\"\n\n\"Great, I like posing for photographs. What's the dress code for looking like a normal person? Black tie? Pith helmet? Summer drinks? Country wedding? Grouse shoot?\"\n\n\"Hi-vis jackets are usually the norm, Brother Boris.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"Right, so we'll set up in Whitehall. Now, the correct behaviour at these events is to wave placards, get a loud-hailer, and of course to shout 'SCAB' at anyone we don't like. Dominic says he'll write some anonymous banners claiming we've left the EU already, and are working hard to put a zillion pounds a week into the NHS, and Brother Francois will act as the megaphone. As you can see he will be dressed as a Ginster's pasty, fine outfit, brother, suits you.\"\n\n\"I was born this way.\"\n\n\"Quoting Lady Brouhaha, like it, like it, common touch, what. Equal rights for pastry and associated foodstuffs. Now, it's time for our correspondence. Brother Raab, what news from our international partners in the battle against small business?\"\n\n\"Well, we have cut off relations with Brother Trump because he's letting white phosophorus be fired at Kurdish children, Brother Putin still hasn't explained that unfortunate food poisoning incident, and Fr\u00e8re Macron says, oh I don't know, it's all foreign to me. On the plus side, we have had a message of solidarity from Brother Corbyn, who wishes us well. Sadly, after seditious action within his own bargaining unit, he is unable to join us at the braziers but has asked Brother Burgon to explain to the world how Labour won the last general election.\"\n\n\"You can't trust these Trots, brethren, I've said it before. Speaking of braziers, Brother Mogg, you'll be in charge of locating some dustbins for us to start a bonfire of EU regulations in. Remember to ensure it is a metal dustbin, not a plastic one.\"\n\n\"I've asked Nanny to polish the family coal scuttle. It's quite large, can hold three unemployed miners, and has the family crest embossed upon it.\"\n\n\"That'll have to do. Remember, folks, this is a picket not a wicket, so no need for kneepads, but those being interviewed by Kay Burley are advised to wear cricket boxes. Now, as to news from the ditch-digging sub-committee. This as you know was begun to divert the attentions of those traitors who flagrantly disobey the rules I make up, and insist on following the rules of the Conservative and Unionist Party instead. They were all given shovels and told to dig in different places at different times. Sister Patel, can you update us?\"\n\n\"Bad news, chairman. The ditch-diggers now number 21 and the individual holes they have dug are so big they have now made one large hole, into which you may well fit. They have asked for your waist measurements to help them in this regard, and say they intend to curtail your freedom of movement to the extent that you cannot Brexit and cannot get a general election either.\"\n\n(Image: WPA Pool)\n\n\"I will call a general election!\"\n\n\"You can't.\"\n\n\"I demand a general election!\"\n\n\"Makes no difference.\"\n\n\"The NUMNUTS will campaign for a general election every day and not do any other work until we get one!\"\n\n\"The Labour Party reports it quite approves of this idea, and will be taking control of Parliamentary business to pass the domestic violence bill, a People's Vote bill, and a law against people who tell porkie pies.\"\n\n\"In that case, brethren, this will be a glorious defeat bound to endear us to the working masses who just want us to deliver Brexit!\"\n\n(Image: WPA Pool)\n\nIndustrial strategy committee representative Andrea Leadsom pipes up. \"Are you sure we're a union, anyway? Does Northern Ireland matter to us? I mean, what have unions ever done for us, can anyone tell me that?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Sister Leadbrained. Nothing at all, apart from weekends, 8-hour working days, maternity leave, retirement ages, occupational health and safety, workplace pensions, paid holidays, equality laws, the right not to be sacked if you're ill or pregnant, pay increases, the minimum wage. Or do you mean the union of the United Kingdom? Because that would be peace, prosperity, an absence of civil wars. Or do you mean the Commonwealth? Because we have a much better cricket team as a result. Or the European Union? Because that would be food standards, child car seat regulations, a successful space programme, co-ordination on cross-border terrorism and people trafficking, 3million export jobs and about \u00a378bn a year of our GDP.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"And I probably ought to mention before we walk out that we won't be getting paid for this.\"\n\n\"Say again?\"\n\n(Image: Julian Hamilton/Daily Mirror)\n\n\"Well, when you're on strike you are using your collective power to bargain for something of benefit to you, and it's generally considered that, while that is your right, it's on your own time so we will need to support one another financially during this period in which I am unable either to govern or Brexit because I am making a point about the Brexit I still couldn't do even if everyone voted for it.\"\n\nThere is silence, and the brethren exchange glances while totting up the maths of who has the most money, and which of them has the biggest child maintenance bill.\n\nBrother Mogg is first to speak. \"Chairman, I believe under rule 22, sub-section iii, we need to have a ballot of our members on whether to strike.\"\n\n\"We had a vote already.\"\n\n\"Yes, but now we know what your plan looks like and what it might cost. I think it only right and proper we vote again.\"\n\n(Image: Leon Neal)\n\n\"Well, you can't.\"\n\n\"But it's the will of the people.\"\n\n\"I'm obeying the will of the people, some of whom are now dead, from ages ago, when you said I could do what I wanted. The chair no longer recognises Brother Mogg. In fact, you don't have a quorum. You're not a bargaining unit, you're a, a, a, a ZOMBIE bargaining unit! Aha!\"\n\n\"You do realise we can join another union any time. There's a People's Union of Ditch Diggers and the Liberal Elite now, you know. The bigger the PUDDLE, the muddier you get. And the only power you have left is the ability to call a People's Vote.\"\n\n\"Look, officially, there is no strike. But unofficially, there's a strike. Which looks and feels the same as no strike. You see? It all goes to show how much power I have in this job I always wanted and in which I am in charge of everything that I am not allowed to do, which is everything else. So I shall prorogue this union for an indefinite period, because you clearly agree with me, and so does the Queen, and the people, and the DUP, and... oh.\"\n\nComrade Boris realises he's addressing an empty room. His acolytes have left, having painted him into a corner. He looks about him, clicks his fingers, and wanders off, whistling 'Every Sperm Is Sacred'.", "description": "Britain's newest trade union has its first chapel meeting, and it doesn't go well", "authors": ["Fleet Street Fox", "Image", "Dan Kitwood", "Getty Images", "Wpa Pool", "Julian Hamilton Daily Mirror", "Leon Neal", "Paramount Pictures"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20722640.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_fleet.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
