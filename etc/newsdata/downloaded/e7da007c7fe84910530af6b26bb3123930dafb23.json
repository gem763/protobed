Then maybe, an astounding comeback.\n\nFor the Bulgarian who knocked Roger Federer out of Flushing Meadows, anything seemed possible.\n\n\u201cI was very positive in the third set, really,\u201d Dimitrov said. \u201cI mean, I still had chances.\u201d\n\nBut Daniil Medvedev kept a comeback far at bay, beating Dimitrov 7-6 (5), 6-4, 6-3 in the semifinals Friday at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Dimitrov\u2019s wave of tough tennis wilted with a Grand Slam finals berth at stake.\n\nBut the 28-year-old Dimitrov, once ranked as high as No. 3, refused to think about what could have been had he defeated Medvedev. His run in New York - highlighted by that five-set quarterfinal win over Federer - was a plucky reminder of how just how good he could be at his best.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be too down on myself,\u201d he said. \u201cGreat weeks. First time in semifinal out here. Just going to take a lot of the positives, for sure.\u201d\n\nDimitrov, now ranked 78th, had lost seven of eight matches headed into the U.S. Open, including a straight-sets loss No. 405 Kevin King in July at the Atlanta Open. He lost in the first round of the Rogers Cup and the Western & Southern Open.\n\nThat certainly didn\u2019t foreshadow what happened in New York, when he became the lowest-ranked semifinalist since Jimmy Connors was out of the top 150 in 1991. Connors was even in the stands watching Friday night.\n\nPerhaps Dimitrov knew something: He captioned an Instagram post at the start of the tournament, \u201cSo good to be back in New York!\u201d\n\nIndeed it was, and seemed for a time on the brink of continuing into Sunday\u2019s final. Dimitrov was a point away while leading 6-5 as Medvedev served in the first set. But Dimitrov pounded one forehand into the net and another went long that allowed Medvedev to rally for the win.\n\nDimitrov actually won more points in the set than Medvedev, 43-41. He totaled twice as many winners, 14-7, and made fewer unforced errors, 18-15.\n\nBut he came up small in sets won: 0\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t play good enough on those key points, especially the set point in the first set,\u201d Dimitrov said. \u201cI knew what he\u2019s going to do. He came up with the goods. Second set, again, I was not able to get free points on my serve, or on his for that matter.\u201d\n\nDimitrov, who was long ago dubbed \u201cBaby Fed\u201d because of his similar one-handed backhand and all-court game to Federer, had needed nearly 1\u00bd years before he reached a semifinal at any tour-level event, much less a major. He lost this year in the fourth round at the Australian Open, the third round at the French Open and the first round at Wimbledon.\n\nHis coaches, Andre Agassi and Radek Stepanek, didn\u2019t even bother to show up in New York.\n\nThey were surely watching somewhere - a one-time can\u2019t-miss prospect who finally delivered on some of that potential.\n\n\u201cI still felt that I could have done something else,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what it is right now.\u201d\n\nDOUBLE THE PLEASURE\n\nWhenever, wherever, Juan Sebastian Cabal and Robert Farah are ready to celebrate another Grand Slam title.\n\nCabal and Farah were already feted with a huge celebration in Colombia after they won the doubles titles at Wimbledon. The party might be lit after they became the first Colombian men\u2019s team to win the doubles title at the U.S. Open on Friday.\n\nCabal and Farah beat Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos 6-4, 7-5 in the final. They won their fifth title of the season and became the sixth team to win Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in the same year in the Open era.\n\nFarah returned from Wimbledon to a celebration in Bogota that about made him want to shake his hips.\n\n\u201cI felt like Shakira for two hours,\u201d he said. \u201cYou come out and there is all these journalists, and everyone\u2019s coming and they\u2019re chanting \u2018Colombia! Colombia!\u2019 and there is a bunch of flags in the airport.\u201d\n\nCabal was greeted by thousands of fans at the airport in the Colombian city, Cali. He rode around in a firetruck with Colombian flags waving in celebration.\n\n\u201cWe just have to say, \u2018Thank you, Colombia,\u2019 for all that support and that good vibe they always give us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very happy to represent our country the way that we are doing it.\u201d\n\nCabal and Farah celebrated Friday a year after they were knocked out in the semifinals by eventual champs Mike Bryan and Jack Sock. Cabal and Farah hit 32 winners on Friday and needed just 90 minutes in Arthur Ashe Stadium. They are the third men\u2019s doubles team since 2003 to win Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in a season.\n\nDOUBLE THE FUN\n\nThe fourth-seeded team of Elise Mertens and Aryna Sabalenka will play for the U.S. Open women\u2019s doubles title.\n\nMertens and Sabalenka rallied to beat Caroline Dolehide and Vania King 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in Friday\u2019s semifinal. They advance to play Ash Barty and Victoria Azarenka for the championship on Sunday.\n\nBarty won the women\u2019s doubles title last year at Flushing Meadows with CoCo Vandeweghe. Vandeweghe was still recovering from ankle problems this year so Barty is teaming with Azarenka, who like Barty is a former top-ranked singles player and major champion.\n\nMertens and Sabalenka are trying to win their first Grand Slam title together, getting as far as the French Open semifinals this year.\n\nMertens and Sabalenka defeated Azarenka and Barty this year in the semifinals at Miami in the only career meeting between the teams.\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Grigor Dimitrov saved two match points in the third set, a fleeting sign that perhaps the lowest-ranked semifinalist at the U.S. Open since 1991 could somehow scrap to one more set.
