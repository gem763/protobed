Their star formation is being shut down and astronomers want to know why.\n\nThe first ever Canadian-led large project on one of the world\u2019s leading telescopes is hoping to do just that. The new program, called the Virgo Environment Traced in Carbon Monoxide survey (VERTICO), is investigating, in brilliant detail, how galaxies are killed by their environment.\n\nAs VERTICO\u2019s principal investigator, I lead a team of 30 experts that are using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) to map the molecular hydrogen gas, the fuel from which new stars are made, at high resolution across 51 galaxies in our nearest galaxy cluster, called the Virgo Cluster.\n\nCommissioned in 2013 at a cost of $1.4 billion, ALMA is an array of connected radio dishes at an altitude of 5,000 meters in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. It is an international partnership between Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Chile. The largest ground-based astronomical project in existence, ALMA is the most advanced millimeter-wavelength telescope ever built and ideal for studying the clouds of dense cold gas from which new stars form, which cannot be seen using visible light.\n\nLarge ALMA research programs such as VERTICO are designed to address strategic scientific issues that will lead to a major advance or breakthrough in the field.\n\nGalaxy clusters\n\nWhere galaxies live in the universe and how they interact with their surroundings (the intergalactic medium that surrounds them) and each other are major influences on their ability to form stars. But precisely how this so-called environment dictates the life and death of galaxies remains a mystery.\n\nGalaxy clusters are the most massive and most extreme environments in the universe, containing many hundreds or even thousands of galaxies. Where you have mass, you also have gravity and the huge gravitational forces present in clusters accelerates galaxies to great speeds, often thousands of kilometers-per-second, and superheats the plasma in between galaxies to temperatures so high that it glows with X-ray light.\n\nIn the dense, inhospitable interiors of these clusters, galaxies interact strongly with their surroundings and with each other. It is these interactions that can kill off \u2014 or quench \u2014 their star formation.\n\nUnderstanding which quenching mechanisms shut off star formation and how they do it is main the focus of the VERTICO collaboration\u2019s research.\n\nThe life cycle of galaxies\n\nAs galaxies fall through clusters, the intergalactic plasma can rapidly remove their gas in a violent process called ram pressure stripping. When you remove the fuel for star formation, you effectively kill the galaxy, turning it into a dead object in which no new stars are formed.\n\nIn addition, the high temperature of clusters can stop hot gas cooling and condense onto galaxies. In this case, the gas in the galaxy isn\u2019t actively removed by the environment but is consumed as it forms stars. This process leads to a slow, inexorable shut down in star formation known, somewhat morbidly, like starvation or strangulation.\n\nAn image of the spiral galaxy NGC 4330 in the Virgo Cluster.

(2018), Author provided\n\nWhile these processes vary considerably, each leaves a unique, identifiable imprint on the galaxy\u2019s star-forming gas. Piecing these imprints together to form a picture of how clusters drive changes in galaxies is a major focus of the VERTICO collaboration. Building on decades of work to provide insight into how the environment drives galaxy evolution, we aim to add a critical new piece of the puzzle.\n\nAn ideal case study\n\nThe Virgo Cluster is an ideal location for such a detailed study of the environment. It is our nearest massive galaxy cluster and is in the process of forming, which means that we can get a snapshot of galaxies in different stages of their life cycles. This allows us to build up a detailed picture of how star formation is shut off in cluster galaxies.\n\nGalaxies in the Virgo cluster have been observed at almost every wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum (for example, radio, optical and ultra-violet light), but observations of star-forming gas (made at millimeter wavelengths) with the required sensitivity and resolution do not exist yet. As one of the largest galaxy surveys on ALMA to date, VERTICO will provide high-resolution maps of molecular hydrogen gas \u2014 the raw fuel for star formation \u2014 for 51 galaxies.\n\nWith ALMA data for this large sample of galaxies, it will be possible to reveal exactly which quenching mechanisms, ram pressure stripping or starvation, are killing galaxies in extreme environments and how.\n\nBy mapping the star-forming gas in galaxies that are the smoking gun examples of the environment-driven quenching, VERTICO will advance our current understanding of how galaxies evolve in the densest regions of the Universe.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation by Toby Brown, Post Doctorate Fellow in Astrophysics, McMaster University under a Creative Commons license.
