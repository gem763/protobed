I have a favor I want from you, though, and I\u2019m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good,\u201d Schiff, channeling Trump, told the committee. \u201cI want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it.\u201d\n\nThe chairman\u2019s monologue drew quick scorn from conservative commentators , as well as Trump\u2019s campaign staff and Capitol Hill allies , and Schiff sought to clarify his remarks later in the hearing.\n\n\u201cMy summary of the president\u2019s call was meant to be at least part in parody. The fact that that\u2019s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cMy point is, that\u2019s the message that the Ukraine president was receiving, in not so many words.\u201d\n\nBut Trump refused to accept that explanation Friday, twice calling for Schiff\u2019s resignation and claiming that he \u201clied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public.\u201d\n\nThe attacks came after Trump, tweeting just after 7 a.m., accused CNN of purposefully misreporting his derisive \u2014 and curiously phrased \u2014 nickname for his Democratic foil.\n\n\u201cTo show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is, I used the word Liddle\u2019, not Liddle, in discribing Corrupt Congressman Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff. Low ratings @CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN!\u201d Trump wrote in his message, which incorrectly spelled the word \u201cdescribing\u201d and confused two punctuation marks.\n\nThe hosts of Trump\u2019s favorite morning show, \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d were also irritated by Schiff's statement Thursday, devoting a brief segment to knocking him in the opening minutes of their broadcast.\n\n\u201cIf you are the chairman of a committee, and you\u2019re trying to get credibility for your latest impeachment push, why would you start in the fiction section of the library?\u201d asked co-host Brian Kilmeade.\n\nLater in the program, Trump attorney Jay Sekulow likened the performance to a \u201c\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 routine,\u201d while White House spokesman Hogan Gidley mocked it as \u201csome type of crazy cosplay convention\u201d where Schiff was \u201cdressing up like a congressman reading fantasy.\u201d\n\nSchiff in recent days had been at the center of a protracted struggle between the legislative and executive branches, as lawmakers sought access to an explosive whistleblower complaint that detailed Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky and alleged efforts by White House officials to \"lock down\" records of the conversation.\n\nMaguire eventually provided the complaint after initially refusing to turn it over to Congress, and acknowledged during his testimony Thursday that he first consulted with the White House counsel\u2019s office and the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel about the document.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/44/b5/953e15234fa19fa6e97694910465/19927-adam-schiff-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
