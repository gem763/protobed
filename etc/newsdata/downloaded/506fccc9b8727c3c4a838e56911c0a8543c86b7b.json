Daniels, who was nominated for a 2019 Tony Award for starring as Atticus Finch, will perform in his final show on Nov. 3.\n\nBrendan Gleeson, another Emmy-winner famous for his role as Alastor Moody in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d series, will play President Donald Trump, who fired Comey in 2017.\n\nThe former FBI director\u2019s memoir, which hit the top of the New York Times bestseller list following its release last year, takes stock of his decades-long criminal justice career. The title is inspired by Trump\u2019s alleged demands for Comey\u2019s allegiance regarding an investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. After he left the FBI, Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee and told lawmakers that the president said he expected \u201cloyalty\u201d from the then-FBI director when the two conversed during a private dinner months before he was unceremoniously fired.\n\nThe memoir soon became a thorn in the president\u2019s side, prompting him to lash out on Twitter, attempting to discredit Comey\u2019s account before it even appeared on the shelves.\n\nDaniels has been a vocal critic of Trump, slamming the president in a May MSNBC interview for having \u201ccompletely soiled the Oval Office.\u201d\n\nNo premiere date for CBS\u2019 program has yet been announced.", "description": "The small-screen adaptation of the former FBI director's memoir will also feature Emmy-winner Brendan Gleeson as Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9b7fce200000f2004ec1a4.jpeg?cache=4jo0e2p1v7&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
