It\u2019s not just that he makes one move and unbalances them, but he sees what nobody else sees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced that what he sees, you can\u2019t even see from the stands. And now he looks fresher. We\u2019re happy because he\u2019s doing well and because we\u2019re enjoying how he plays.\u201d\n\nThe No. 10 has regained the ground he lost after a foot problem prevented him playing any part in pre-season.\n\nIf Barcelona\u2019s title rivals had a headstart this season while the forward was out of action, Messi has already helped his side catch up and is just hitting the top of his game.", "description": "Lionel Messi has already played an important part for Barcelona this season but the forward finally hit his unstoppable best in a 5-1 win over Real Valladolid in La Liga on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446345067&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T001", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
