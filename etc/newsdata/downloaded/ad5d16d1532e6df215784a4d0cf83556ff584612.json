AAPL, -0.23%, issued 30-year bonds while paying investors yields of less than 3%.\n\nOngoing borrowing this week brought the monthly high-grade corporate debt tally closer to Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s $120 billion to $130 billion issuance forecast for the month, even with a full two weeks still left on the calendar.\n\nKraft Heinz Foods Co KHC, -0.85% joined a handful of BBB-rated companies, with ratings on the cusp of high-yield, that tapped the bond market on Wednesday to borrow $5.7 billion, according to BAML data.\n\nRead: Gundlach sees 75% recession chance, has a warning about the corporate bond market\n\nCorporate borrowing even kept pace through Thursday\u2019s European Central Bank\u2019s policy meeting, which resulted in deposit interest rates being cut deeper into negative territory and a restart of monthly bond purchases.\n\nCheck out: ECB cuts key rate, relaunches QE to shore up eurozone economy\n\nIn the high-yield bond market, Uber Technologies Inc. UBER, +0.21% said Thursday it raised $1.2 billion through an eight-year debt offering that increased from an initial size of $750 million, a sign of market confidence in the ride-hailing company after its shares have tumbled 18% since its May IPO.\n\nMeanwhile, bankers said corporate borrowers have been focused on tweets, tariffs and benchmark rates.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.30% has been climbing in recent sessions, with Thursday seeing it touch a nearly six-week high of 1.723%. Bond prices move in the opposite direction as yields. Because corporate bonds also price at a premium over risk-free Treasurys, upswings in the benchmark can lead to higher borrowing costs.\n\nStill, negative yields elsewhere have been a boon for U.S. high-grade borrowers.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s keeping the market hungry is the collapsing of foreign yields,\u201d said David Knutson, head of Schroder\u2019s U.S. credit research, Americas.\n\n\u201cWe can wince all we want about high-yield bonds at around 1% in Europe, but if you made promises to return a certain yield to investors, you\u2019re getting forced in.\u201d\n\nScott Kimball, senior portfolio manager at Taplin, Canida and Habacht, a part of BMO Global Asset Management, said corporate borrowers likely had little to gain by holding off to borrow until after the Sept. 17-18 Fed meetings, when benchmark rates could go lower yet.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be kind of splitting hairs,\u201d he told MarketWatch, noting that most of the Treasury yield curve currently resides below 2%. The other factor, he said, was that Fed officials have given the market mixed signals about whether additional benchmark rate cuts are necessary.\n\nTrump on Thursday used tweets to complain that the latest ECB stimulus was designed to depreciate the euro and hurt U.S. exports. In a separate message, Trump also said China was expected to be buying \u201clarge amounts of our agricultural products.\u201d\n\nRead: Trump blasts ECB and talks up China\u2019s buying of U.S. farm goods\n\nRenewed trade optimism on Thursday helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.17% mark its longest win streak in more than a year, while pushing higher the S&P 500 SPX, +0.29% and Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.30%\n\nTrump\u2019s social-media habits have left Wall Street looking for ways to parse how markets react to his tweets.\n\nJ.P. Morgan recently created a \u201cVolfefe\u201d index, a nod to a Trump\u2019s \u201ccovfefe\u201d typo from two years ago, with the aim of tracking what impact his digital messages have on U.S. rates.\n\nWhile U.S. corporations could benefit from the lower rates Trump has tweeted at the Fed to make, heads of business also have been feeling the sting as he blasts off messages.\n\nIn the past six months, executives at the helm of companies ranging from shoe-seller Designer Brands Inc. DBI, -0.94% to manufacturing company Spectrum Brands Inc. SPB, +0.61% to chip maker Microchip Technology Inc. MCHP, +0.05% each said Oval Office tweets had an impact on business strategy, earning expectations or borrowing habits, according to a MarketWatch review of earnings calls during that period.\n\nReal estate mogul Barry Sternlicht, the CEO of Starwood Property Trust STWD, +0.21%, also said that \u201cthe trade wars fought at 4 a.m. with tweets\u201d has put businesses on edge and increased the odds of a U.S. downturn, during his company\u2019s Aug. 7 earnings call.\n\n\u201cI think it erodes confidence,\u201d Sternlicht said. \u201cAll they have to do is slow down the investment and you have recessions [or] at least a significant slowdown.\u201d", "description": "Low rates are a key reason why high-grade U.S. companies issued a record $90 billion of bonds in the first week of September, but so are desires to avoid...", "authors": ["Joy Wiltermuth", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR222_Trumpt_ZG_20190912191943.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
