The 40-year-old stayed in Los Angeles to meet Monday with a hand specialist.\n\nWith Brees out, Teddy Bridgewater will become the Saints\u2019 starting quarterback. The former Minnesota Vikings starter went 17 of 30 for 165 yards Sunday after subbing for Brees.\n\nIf the Saints decide to put Drew Brees on IR for the thumb surgery that is required, he would be unable to practice for six weeks and would to miss eight games. Saints also could not place him on IR and bring him back when ready. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) September 16, 2019\n\nSaints\u2019 QB Drew Brees is expected to undergo thumb surgery as early as today that would be expected to sideline him approximately 6 weeks, per leagues sources. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) September 16, 2019\n\nThe next step for Drew Brees is to decide who is doing the surgery and what procedure he\u2019ll do.
