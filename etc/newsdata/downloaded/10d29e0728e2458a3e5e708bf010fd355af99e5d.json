Tokyo has offered to act as a intermediary between the two countries to help ease tension in the region.\n\nIran has criticised U.S. efforts to set up a coalition and says countries in the region can protect key waterways used by oil tankers supplying much of the world's oil.\n\nMilitary assets Japan sends to the Middle East are likely to include warships and aircraft that will patrol the Gulf of Oman, the Northern Arabian Sea and other waters in the area, Japan's chief government spokesman said. Japan has yet to decide the make up of the contingent or when it will deploy the force, he added.
