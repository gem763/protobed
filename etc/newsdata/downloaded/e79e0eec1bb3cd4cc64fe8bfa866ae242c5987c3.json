Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.) by less than 2 points in the last election. But in 2016, this upstate New York district went for Donald Trump by more than 15 points.\n\nAnd with Trump back on the ballot in 2020, Tenney and her supporters see a chance to make her comeback.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a good year,\u201d Tenney said in an interview. \u201cIn a presidential year, I think we\u2019ll be able to get some of those gains back.\u201d\n\nAnd she\u2019s not the only one. A series of ex-Republican lawmakers who lost narrowly in Trump strongholds in 2018 are plotting rematches next year with dreams of riding on the president\u2019s coattails.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
