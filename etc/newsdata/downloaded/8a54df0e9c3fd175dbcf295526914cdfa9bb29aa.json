Luhnow reached out to Apstein earlier Friday to set up the conversation.\n\nDuring the meeting, which lasted about 10 minutes, Apstein requested the Astros issue a retraction for the original statement they put out Monday night that suggested she had fabricated her story about the events in the Houston clubhouse after the team clinched the American League Championship Series. Luhnow declined to commit to issuing one.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore Lunhow\u2019s meeting with Apstein, Crane skirted questions and attempted to move past the World Series-marring controversy.\n\n\u201cWe made our statement, we got it wrong from the start,\u201d Crane told a handful of reporters. \u201cJeff had reached out to the reporters and apologized. We made our statement. Other than that, we\u2019re not going revisit at this point. We\u2019ll play baseball.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Rob Manfred said MLB is still looking into the incident and its aftermath, and that the league needs more time to conclude its investigation. League-issued discipline for the Astros, current team officials and Brandon Taubman remains in play.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to review the situation and have conversations,\u201d Manfred told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to come and investigate, in 24 hours, a specific incident. This will take a little more time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nManfred said MLB wants to examine \u201ca variety of issues\u201d regarding the Astros, including \u201caspects of this that go beyond the incident.\u201d\n\nThe incident occurred in the Astros clubhouse after the team\u2019s win over the New York Yankees in Game 6 of the ALCS. As Apstein stood with two other female reporters, one of whom was wearing a purple domestic violence awareness bracelet, Taubman chanted at them: \u201cThank God we got Osuna! I\u2019m so f------ glad we got Osuna!\u201d It was a reference to Astros closer Roberto Osuna, who was acquired in a trade with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2018 after being suspended 75 games for violating baseball\u2019s domestic violence policy.\n\nImmediately after Apstein\u2019s report was published, the Astros issued a statement that called the story \u201ccompletely irresponsible\u201d and accused Apstein of trying to \u201cfabricate\u201d a story. Several other reporters corroborated her version of events and Taubman was fired Thursday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt a news conference Thursday, Luhnow said the Astros should not have issued the original statement, but would not say whether any Astros employees would be disciplined for accusing Apstein of fabricating her story.\n\nRead more World Series coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "Commissioner Rob Manfred said MLB is still looking into the incident and its aftermath.", "authors": ["Adam Kilgore", "Reporter Covering National Sports", "Ben Strauss", "Sports", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3xhhvIrQrAMTvsxCC1FcIce_yNA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CX74OGXXGAI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
