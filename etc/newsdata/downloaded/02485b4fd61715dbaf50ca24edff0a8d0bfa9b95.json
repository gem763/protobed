Need proof? Biel shared one of her 4-year-old\u2019s recent quips during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\n\n\u201cNow he\u2019s telling the joke and gets the joke, which is terrifying,\u201d Biel said. She went on to recount a story of when the family was traveling in St. Louis. Silas \u201cwas doing a bit about, \u2018I don\u2019t like waffles anymore. I don\u2019t like waffles,'\u201d Jessica recalled. \u201cAnd Justin goes, \u2018What? What do you mean you don\u2019t like waffles? Are you insane?'\u201d Biel recalled. \u201cHe goes, \u2018I\u2019m in St. Louis.\u2019 That\u2019s a good joke! I\u2019m stealing that joke. That was really impressive.\u201d\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nBut has Silas inherited his father\u2019s song-and-dance talents? Well \u2014 maybe. \u201cHe likes to sing,\u201d Biel said. But when asked if her son has rhythm, the actress paused. \u201cHe does \u2026 he has his own kind of rhythm. \u2026 Maybe not.\u201d To be fair, not many people can measure up to Timberlake as far as rhythm is concerned. Biel recounted a recent night out she and her husband had after the Louis Vuitton show at Paris Fashion Week. \u201cWe stayed out dancing until literally 3 am. I think we forgot that we were in our late thirties and we thought maybe we were in our early twenties or something,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd what does one do when sharing a dance floor with her famous husband ? \u201cYou just give up and move away and sort of admire. Or, you throw out your best moves and see what sticks,\u201d she said.\n\nLegendary as Timberlake\u2019s talents may be, his wife actually wasn\u2019t always so impressed by them. A recently-surfaced 1999 interview from Biel revealed that the 7th Heaven star actually wasn\u2019t a huge fan of Timberlake\u2019s back in the day.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t really listen [to NSYNC],\u201d she said. \u201cI know of them, of course, and I\u2019ve heard of them, and I\u2019ve heard the music. I don\u2019t think I own any of their CDs. I\u2019m not a huge fan, but, I mean, cool I guess.\u201d My, how things have changed!\n\nBest of SheKnows\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.
