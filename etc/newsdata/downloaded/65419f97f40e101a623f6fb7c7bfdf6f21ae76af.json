The U.S., the official added, would send these migrants to Honduras so they can have the \"opportunity\" to seek asylum or another form of protection there.\n\n\"It will allow migrants to seek protection as close to home as possible,\" the Homeland Security official said during a call with reporters.\n\nAccording to the official, the accord would apply to migrants who seek asylum or protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT) \u2014 a lesser form of humanitarian relief \u2014 in the U.S.\n\nHaitian migrants remain outside a migration shelter in Guatemala City on June 10, 2019. - At least 144 migrants of Angola, Congo, Haiti and Brazil -whose final destination was Mexico- were captured on June 8 when they entered illegally to Guatemala from Honduras.

Most of the migrant families and unaccompanied children who have headed to the U.S.-Mexico border in unprecedented numbers in recent months have hailed from these three countries, collectively known as the Northern Triangle \u2014 a region that has long suffered from deeply-rooted economic inequality and political instability.\n\nIn practice, those likely to be affected by the implementation of Wednesday's agreement will be migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Brazil, Venezuela and African nations that have journeyed to the U.S.-Mexico border in larger numbers in the past year.\n\nThe Homeland Security official said the deal committed the U.S. to help the government of Honduras bolster its asylum system \u2014 a similar pledge made to leaders in Guatemala and El Salvador.\n\nThe agreement, signed on the sidelines of the annual United Nations General Assembly, follows months of discussions with the government of President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, a staunch international ally of the Trump administration who has been dogged by accusations of corruption.\n\n\n\nSolving the crisis at the border means working with our neighbors in the region. Honduras has been a great partner. Today we signed a bilateral agreement to build stronger asylum capabilities in the Northern Triangle and further enhance asylum and protection capacity in Honduras. pic.twitter.com/8I37iEu97r \u2014 Acting Sec.

He himself was named by the Justice Department last month as an unindicted co-conspirator in a drug conspiracy and money laundering case against his brother.\n\nAsked if Hern\u00e1ndez's implication in a drug conspiracy case was considered in negotiations, the Homeland Security official declined to comment, referring the matter to the Justice Department instead.\n\nHonduras' President Juan Orlando Hernandez sits before addressing the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York City, September 25, 2019.

Earlier in the summer, the U.S. and the Guatemalan government brokered an agreement to allow the Trump administration to deport asylum seekers who traveled from other countries through Guatemala to reach the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 and these migrants would be required to seek asylum in Guatemala instead.\n\nLike the agreements with Guatemala and El Salvador, the deal announced on Wednesday with Honduras has not been implemented. The Homeland Security official said all countries involved are proceeding to fulfill the respective domestic legal obligations to ratify the accords.", "description": "The Trump administration now has new immigration deals with all three countries in Central America's Northern Triangle", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/25/7ce25599-2df5-4609-8f89-5ed6b6a89d8c/thumbnail/1200x630/f16dd5e2841de155dc1d8e1c52721bc8/ap-19178090038982.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
