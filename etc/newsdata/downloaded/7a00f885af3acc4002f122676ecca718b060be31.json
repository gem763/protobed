Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\n\n\n(iStock/Washington Post illustration)\n\nLike so much discord in the digital age, it all began with a tweet. On Friday, Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team, posted an image showing support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protesters. The somewhat anodyne message of solidarity \u2014 which was later removed \u2014 unleashed a fire hose of acrimony. Chinese netizens and state institutions reacted with outrage over a perceived attack on Chinese sovereignty; American politicians in an increasingly anti-Beijing Washington decried Chinese nationalism; the U.S. National Basketball Association, the league to which the Rockets belonged, found itself awkwardly caught in the middle and issued a mealy-mouthed apology that only stoked the controversy.\n\nThe league later put out different statements in Chinese and English. A message posted on Chinese social media suggested NBA officials were \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by what it deemed was Morey\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d comment. A subsequent message put out by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver purported to uphold American values on the world stage. \u201cValues of equality, respect and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA \u2014 and will continue to do so,\u201d Silver said Tuesday. \u201cAs an American-based basketball league operating globally, among our greatest contributions are these values of the game.\u201d\n\nThe NBA has spent decades blazing a path into China, where it retains tens of millions of die-hard fans. The Rockets \u2014 who for years boasted towering Chinese superstar Yao Ming in their ranks \u2014 are especially popular. Their footprint in the world\u2019s most populous nation proved deeply lucrative. But all of that steady corporate work seemed at risk in the aftermath of Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cIt is not feasible to conduct exchanges and cooperation with the Chinese yet not understand Chinese public opinion,\u201d declared China\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, on Tuesday.\n\nThat same day, China\u2019s state television network announced it would withhold broadcasts at least for this week of the NBA\u2019s preseason games. A series of Chinese brands, including smartphone maker Vivo and the Luckin Coffee chain, severed sponsorship deals with the American league. Criticism also came from Tencent, the major Chinese tech firm that has a $1.5 billion streaming deal with the NBA. In the United States, Republican senators and Democratic presidential candidates all cajoled the NBA to stand its ground and not cave to this form of political correctness with Chinese characteristics.\n\nChina is trying to use its market power to silence free speech and criticism of its conduct. In response, the NBA chose its pocketbook over its principles\u2014and our values. We should all be speaking out in support of those protesting for their rights. https://t.co/IRiIY1cgDg \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019\n\nThough the protests in Hong Kong have struck a particularly sensitive nerve in China, the current spat is hardly a stand-alone occurrence \u2014 and it may be a sign of things to come. \u201cAs China\u2019s economic clout expands, its government and consumers are coercing international companies and punishing speech they deem critical, adding a growing element of unpredictability for foreign executives weighing the opportunities and risks of doing business in the country,\u201d explained The Post\u2019s Gerry Shih.\n\nThere were other incidents just this week. After a recent episode of the irreverent American cartoon comedy \u201cSouth Park\u201d mocked how Hollywood studios and executives create content these days in fear of Chinese censorship, Chinese censors followed through and carried out a sweeping purge of the show from Chinese streaming sites and social media pages. Blizzard, an American video game company that counts Tencent as a part investor, became the target of an Internet boycott after it banned a champion esports contestant who called for Hong Kong\u2019s liberation and stripped him of his prize money.\n\nIn the past, other Western companies have suffered similar censure. Mercedes-Benz apologized for hurting \u201cthe feelings of the Chinese people\u201d when it cited the Dalai Lama, Tibet\u2019s spiritual leader in exile, in an Instagram post. Companies as disparate as U.S. airline Delta and Spanish fashion brand Zara both issued groveling apologies after publicly listing operations in Taiwan \u2014 which China views as a breakaway province \u2014 as a separate country from China on its website.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing new about Chinese nationalist anger. But Beijing\u2019s political tensions with Washington and China\u2019s growing global clout are forcing multinational firms to pay attention. \u201cThese dynamics have gone on for a long time,\u201d tweeted Paul Mozur, a China tech correspondent for the New York Times. \u201cThe Hong Kong protests are causing China\u2019s underbelly of speech control to go mainstream in a huge way. The more Beijing pushes for control, the more the global narrative will slip away from it, and it won\u2019t be pretty.\u201d\n\nThe current disputes underscore a now inescapable reality of global politics. Many U.S. firms \u2014 along with corporate behemoths like the NBA \u2014 went into China insisting that their forays into a vast, untapped market would bring the world closer together. The opening of China\u2019s economy, many genuinely believed, would be followed by an inexorable liberalization of Chinese politics and society.\n\nThat has not happened. Instead, the events of the past week have only reinforced widespread fears among U.S. analysts over China\u2019s corrosive influence on Western practices and norms. If China can browbeat foreign firms so easily now, what will the status quo look like two or three decades from now, when the habits and demands of the Chinese middle-class consumer will have an even greater impact on the global economy?\n\nChina \u201chas been rising for more than 40 years, unaccompanied by effective public pressure for reform. It opted in to the liberal order without liberalizing,\u201d wrote Kori Schake, a former Bush administration official, in an essay published last year. \u201cDespite President Xi Jinping\u2019s expansive statements about preserving the liberal order, China undercuts it politically, economically, and militarily.\u201d\n\nAdam Silver was criticized in social media of both China&the US.This is the result when sport enters political minefield. The more the US forces NBA to be politically correct, the narrower NBA's path will be, because Chinese fans&Chinese public won't buy US political correctness. \u2014 Hu Xijin \u80e1\u9521\u8fdb (@HuXijin_GT) October 7, 2019\n\nChina\u2019s touchy feelings over Hong Kong, meanwhile, obscure the genuine sense of crisis brewing in the former British colony. Beijing looks unlikely to concede much, while a hardcore segment of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters are turning more and more radicalized. \u201cThe calculus of Communist rule does not allow for concessions to unruly provinces,\u201d noted Jamil Anderlini of the Financial Times. \u201cIf Xi were to compromise and grant Hong Kong the right to vote for its leaders then what about Shanghai or Shenzhen? If he does not harshly punish the territory then the rest of the nation and his many political enemies would smell weakness, rather than applaud his restraint. Because the people of Hong Kong instinctively understand what is coming, they are unlikely to quietly return to their ordinary lives.\u201d\n\nThe upheaval has already been deeply damaging for foreign companies operating in the city, where both protesters and Beijing\u2019s pressure campaigns have targeted businesses believed to be favoring the other side.\n\n\u201cHong Kong as Asia\u2019s world city is finished. There is no way that Hong Kong can recapture its reputation as an efficient, safe, well-governed, orderly place to live and work and do business anymore,\u201d Mike Chinoy, a Hong Kong-based nonresident senior fellow at the University of Southern California\u2019s U.S.-China Institute, told my colleagues. \u201cSome of this stuff you can\u2019t put back together.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
