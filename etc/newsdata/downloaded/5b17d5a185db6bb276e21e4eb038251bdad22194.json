Chuck Todd Explains How Hunter Biden Has Been 'Weaponized Politically'", "language": "en", "text": "MSNBC's Chuck Todd had a rather interesting take on the entire Ukraine whistleblower saga. Instead of focusing on the potential corruption that took place between Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, Todd believes Hunter is being unfairly attacked.\n\n\"Speaking with the vice president now, about his son, has always been difficult, even for his own team and so getting him to the point where he'd have a moment with a more forthright conversation about what his son was doing is a difficult one and not one that they're ready to have yet,\" NBC News Correspondent Mike Memoli said.\n\n\"He's a father who has already lost two children to death and now he's got a third one, child, being used as a political, it's been weaponized politically,\" Todd explained. \"I challenge any parent to deal with that.\"\n\nIn the early 1970s, Biden's first wife, Neilia, and his daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car accident. The other two kids, Beau and Hunter, survived the accident. Beau Biden lost his battle with brain cancer in 2015 after several years of fighting.\n\nAlthough it's tragic that Joe Biden lost two of his children, this shouldn't be an excuse for Hunter's behavior to go unnoticed or unpunished, should the allegations of impropriety hold true. Plenty of people lose loved ones in tragic ways but that doesn't mean they are no longer held responsible for their actions or decisions.", "description": "Wow..09/25/2019 2:54:11AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2014/226/20e07ceb-eea7-4485-b61a-e6fae7aa7028.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
