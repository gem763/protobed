The researchers said Huawei is planning to include a fix in a future update.\n\nCheck Point published further details in a blog post about how the vulnerability can be exploited and the tools needed to do so.\n\n\"This attack flow enables anyone who has a cheap USB modem to trick users into installing malicious settings onto their phones,\" the blog stated.", "description": "A major security flaw with Android\u00a0mobile operating system\u00a0has left over a billion Samsung, Huawei, LG and Sony smartphones vulnerable to cyber attacks.
