Whistleblower#1\u2019s complaint to Congress has exposed Trump\u2019s self-dealing with the Ukrainian president. But that\u2019s not all. It has also exposed a network of shady, sneaky agents advancing Trump\u2019s schemes, against the national interest. And it has blown up their cover story, putting Trump clearly on the defensive.\n\nThat one complaint has led to the motherload of all meltdowns by Team Trump. They\u2019re scattering like roaches in the light of day. Events are occurring so fast that Trump\u2019s defenders can\u2019t keep up and are flummoxed. It\u2019ll only get worse.\n\nIn fact, it already has.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWilliam Taylor\u2019s testimony Tuesday confirmed and documented Trump as chief provocateur of the quid pro quo. Case closed.\n\nWhat Trump is up against is something he never had a clue existed and could therefore never be prepared for: the structured phalanx of professional, disciplined, honest civil servants in the intelligence and diplomatic communities who will never let him get away with self-dealing if it subverts global democracy.\n\nTrump knew there would be some in government wise to his antics and who would speak out. That\u2019s why he adopted the bogeyman \u201cDeep State\u201d to dismiss them as \u201cangry Democrats\u201d who disagree with his politics, so they launched a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nTrump comes from a world in which self-dealing was in the DNA, literally from when he was a zygote. Having learned at the feet of first his father and then his mentor and lawyer Roy Cohn, he had the tools to thrive in the shadows.\n\nIn his business and then his campaign for president, Trump was always surrounded by yes men. If you didn\u2019t facilitate his dealings, you were gone. He\u2019d find someone else who would.\n\nHe\u2019s using that approach in the White House. The tsunami of staff turnover in his administration, White House included, is ample evidence. Who would have thought that when Trump asked former national security advisor John Bolton John BoltonImpeachment inquiry might be public by mid-November: report Trump's new challenge is officials dishing dirt Former Nunes staffer fueled Trump's Ukrainian corruption claims: report MORE to resign because he couldn\u2019t get along with people, that those people were the network of shady, sneaky agents of Trump\u2019s self-dealing, headed by Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiTrump's new challenge is officials dishing dirt Budowsky: Trump presidency in mortal peril Graham nixes plan to send Pelosi letter warning GOP won't convict Trump MORE?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDuring and after two years of Special Counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerFox News legal analyst says Trump call with Ukraine leader could be 'more serious' than what Mueller 'dragged up' Lewandowski says Mueller report was 'very clear' in proving 'there was no obstruction,' despite having 'never' read it Fox's Cavuto roasts Trump over criticism of network MORE\u2019s Russia investigation, Trump and his defenders bullied, denied, obfuscated, and hoodwinked Congress and the public into a stalemate. The scheme has worked so far, thanks to some deceit by Attorney General William Barr in misinterpreting Mueller\u2019s findings, and the profound incompetence of the House Democrats as a worthy opponent.\n\nNow, it\u2019s a different story.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint has turned the tables, giving the House the upper hand. That\u2019s because Trump, Barr, et al, neither control the information nor who comes through the revolving door of witnesses. As each witness comes forward, we\u2019re learning who the shady characters are and what their schemes were. Team Trump has ordered witnesses not to cooperate. He\u2019s already lost that battle. The dam has broken.\n\nIf there were ever a doubt, the testimony from Taylor \u2014 a professional diplomat, decorated veteran of the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam, and appointee of both George W. Bush and Donald Trump \u2014 erased it. Trump and his defenders cannot cope with a credible response. Their choice to defend was either a scholarly dialectic approach or schoolyard mud wrestling. Based on Wednesday\u2019s disruption tactics of yet further testimony, they\u2019ve chosen the latter.\n\nMy mentor, legendary fighter pilot Col. John Boyd, developed a concept called the OODA Loop. It\u2019s applied in combat, business, sports, litigation, etc. The acronym stands for observation, orientation, decision, action. Anyone who goes through that cycle quicker than their opponent takes the advantage.\n\nRight now, the House and the IC are in, as we call it, Trump\u2019s OODA Loop. They have the advantage. And all of Team Trump know it. That\u2019s why they are flailing. White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s admission of holding up aid to Ukraine for a political favor \u2014 and then insisting he didn\u2019t describe a quid pro quo because he didn\u2019t actually say the Latin term \u2014 is the latest clue.\n\nThe press will learn and fill in more of the mosaic of shady operators, what they\u2019re doing, and who they\u2019re colluding with. No doubt, each tile of that mosaic will beget another, supplied by members of the phalanx and by Hill staff. It\u2019s happening right now. Administration officials will bail. Fingers will point.\n\nSo far, we have the president caught red-handed. He has no plausible deniability.\n\nAlso caught red-handed are the shady operators conspiring with equally shady pro-Russian Ukrainians. Many of them, like Giuliani, have neither security clearances nor any recently sworn oaths to the Constitution. Their agendas have been uncovered, and their cover story has been blown a full year before the election.\n\nNews reports and the recent indictment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman suggest the Trump agenda is fabricated dirt on Joe Biden, and a bogus Crowdstrike server in Ukraine; the Russian agenda is the usual \u2014 political influence for corrupt purposes, just like in Ukraine. A little cash can maybe buy them a politician to help get rid of an honest ambassador who\u2019s in their way. Each side would scratch the other\u2019s back. The cost would be minimal \u2014 undermining the national security of the U.S. and Ukraine.\n\nWithout these on-going exposures, we\u2019d be staring at an October surprise next year. I can see it now: Giuliani and his shady operators crawling all over Fox News and the entire right-wing echo chamber, waiving fabricated evidence and affidavits against Joe and Hunter Biden, with reports of a \u201cnewly discovered\u201d Crowdstrike server in Ukraine. It would be the 2.0 version of the tabloid trash Giuliani sent to Congress Oct. 2 via the White House, Secretary of State Pompeo and the State IG.\n\nThe narrative would be: See, just like we said \u2014 the Russians didn\u2019t hack the DNC and interfere in the 2016 elections. It was Ukraine! The Russians are absolved, and so is Trump. It\u2019s not Trump doing a quid pro quo, it\u2019s Joe Biden Joe BidenImpeachment inquiry might be public by mid-November: report The Memo: GOP schisms deepen as Trump impeachment pressure rises Graham nixes plan to send Pelosi letter warning GOP won't convict Trump MORE! The Deep State was wrong!\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUkraine would be thrown under the tractor and would continue to be fertile ground for future furtive deals. Trump would be re-elected, the Russians toasting with champagne. Again.\n\nAll of this would be laugh-out-loud slap stick were it not for how it undermines the national security of both the U.S. and Ukraine, and our shared desire for the rule of law and democracy. This is exactly what the IC and diplomatic communities are fighting to preserve. That\u2019s why they defy Trump\u2019s order against cooperation with Congress.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s self-dealing continues, we\u2019re headed toward exactly the kind of corruption culture Ukraine struggles with now. And Ukraine\u2019s efforts to reverse their course will be stymied. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake. Trump wanted to play ball this way. Now, he\u2019s exposed himself to a perfect storm of backlash.\n\nHe\u2019s met his match.\n\nKris Kolesnik is a 34-year veteran of federal government oversight.
