I\u2019ve seen this at Tottenham before, it stinks of that at the minute.\u201d\n\nJenas then criticised Spurs players for failing to react throughout the game and \u201chiding\u201d.\n\n\u201cLook at this, players standing behind players, that is hiding. It happened throughout the game,\" Jenas added.\n\n\"I think motivation is a big thing here. Alderweireld and Vertonghem, two of the most professional players I know, they work their socks off, but if I was them, I would be saying why am I committed to you?\n\n\"Even though I\u2019ve given you half my career. Same for Eriksen, there are too many of those players. It creates a poor harmony. It\u2019s so difficult to manage that situation as a manager.\u201d", "description": "Jermaine Jenas has declared the end for this Tottenham\u00a0side after Brighton\u00a0compounded a nightmare week for Mauricio Pochettino.\u00a0 The Seagulls dominated Spurs to coast to a 3-0 victory, heaping more misery on Mauricio Pochettino after the 7-2 thrashing against Bayern Munich midweek in the Champions League.", "authors": ["Jack Rathborn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/05/14/Toby-Alderweireld-and-Eric-Dier-applaud-the-travelling-Tottenham-fans.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
