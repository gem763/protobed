Respect is way too important to me, and I won\u2019t put up with him being rude.\u201d Her son was about a year old at the time. Mine was a few years older. So, I laughed.\n\n\u201cYeah, sounds great,\u201d I told her. \u201cIf you figure out the secret, pass it along to me, ok?\u201d\n\nWhat she hadn\u2019t experienced yet was the very real dilemma between 1) wanting to lay down the law because I will NOT raise a kid who speaks to me that way and 2) wanting to model a better way to communicate because they\u2019re more likely to do as we do, not do as we say.\n\nKids, they talk back. And developmentally, they should. Parent Coach Meghan Leahy writes for the Washington Post that when the back-talk ramps up, it may actually mean the child is ready for more independence and control.\n\nSeemingly overnight, your child is ready to walk alone to a friend\u2019s house, organise their own homework, choose all of their own clothing and have opinions about their meals. Though this can feel challenging, it is best to see your child\u2019s opinions and pushback as an invitation to change, rather than just straight-up misbehavior. It is useful to see back talk as a form of communication that needs to be better understood.\n\nStill, it\u2019s annoying at best and infuriating at worst. Luckily, there are some things we can do to minimise the back-talk and de-escalate the situation.\n\nLoosen the reins\n\nAll day long, kids are bossed around. From their morning routine, to their class schedule at school, to putting their shoes away and doing their homework and feeding the dog, they are constantly directed. So when we tell them it\u2019s time to go upstairs and take a shower and they let out a big harumph! and go stomping up the stairs, yelling, \u201cI. Hate. Taking. SHOWERS! Showers. Are. So. STUPID!\u201d we shouldn\u2019t be totally surprised.\n\nThe same way we try to give our toddlers choices to avoid tantrums (do you want to wear the orange shirt or the purple shirt today, honey?), we can find ways for our older kids to make decisions and take over some of the control of their daily lives. Do you want to take a shower tonight or tomorrow morning? Do you want a snack before or after homework? The less we smother and dictate, the more they might relax.\n\nPick your battles\n\nNot all back-talk is created equal, so draw your lines in the sand. What can you live with, and what really is unacceptable? Rachel Simmons, author of \u201cThe Curse of the Good Girl: Raising Authentic Girls With Courage and Confidence,\u201d gives this advice to the New York Times:\n\nDecide when to let something slide \u2014 a throwaway remark, shrug or eye-roll \u2014 and when to push back, Ms. Simmons said. Push back should happen when something goes against the moral values of the home, such as insulting a parent\u2019s appearance or refusing to do chores.\n\nI was the Queen of the Eye Roll in my day, but my parents didn\u2019t seem to care much. In fact, they found it mildly amusing, and nothing kills a good eye roll like your parents enjoying it. Shrug off the little stuff, but be ready to (calmly) stand your ground on the bigger stuff.\n\nRemain unimpressed\n\nThis is my favourite advice, from Amy McCready, founder of Positive Parenting Solutions: \u201cWhile your children are putting on a drama performance worthy of a Tony award, your job is to be an unimpressed attendee.\u201d\n\nMcCready is speaking my language here. This is where we can really model for them how to react to conflict: By being calm, firm and kind.\n\nSimply say, \u201cI feel hurt by the way you\u2019re talking to me. When I hear that tone of voice, I\u2019m going to walk away. We can talk again when you can speak respectfully to me.\u201d Then walk away. Next time it happens, there\u2019s no need for even a warning \u2014 simply leave the room. You\u2019re sending the message that you refuse to participate in a power struggle. And when there\u2019s no one to fight with, there\u2019s no fight!\n\nIf you struggle with that in the moment, try to channel your inner Michelle Obama. When they go low, we go high. When they talk back, we stay calm.", "description": "A friend of mine once went on a tirade about how she would not raise a disrespectful kid. \u201cThat\u2019s just not happening,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will not talk back.
