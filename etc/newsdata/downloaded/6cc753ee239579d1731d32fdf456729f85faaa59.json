The indictment was related to campaign finance violations that were reported in July 2018 \u2014 before the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d reported the call \u2014 and had nothing to do with the subject of the \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York unsealed an indictment against four U.S. citizens, three of whom were born abroad. Two of them, Ukrainian-American Lev Parnas and Belarussian-American Igor Fruman, are political neophytes who are accused of passing campaign contributions from a foreign donor to pro-Trump organizations through a fictitious company. They also made other fraudulent individual contributions to politicians they hoped to influence \u201cso as to advance their own personal financial interests and the political interests of Ukrainian government officials, including at least one Ukrainian government official,\u201d the indictment reads.\n\nIt is believed that these two businessmen were involved in Giuliani\u2019s efforts to investigate the conflict of interest by former Vice President Joe Biden, whose son Hunter was a paid board member of a Ukrainian oil and gas company.\n\nBut the indictment does not mention the Giuliani investigation at all. Nor does it mention the Ukraine call itself.\n\nThe only thing the indictment and the phone call share in common is a mention of the effort to replace the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine. Paras and Fruman allegedly hoped donations to a \u201cCongressman-1\u201d \u2014 later identified in media reports as former Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) \u2014 would influence him to ask the administration to replace the ambassador. In a statement, Sessions said he approached the State Department, but not because the businessmen asked him to: rather, he said, he was informed by other colleagues that the ambassador was trashing the president.\n\nIn the White House transcript (or \u201creadout\u201d) of the Ukraine call, the president refers to the ambassador having been removed already, adding that she was \u201cbad news,\u201d as were the \u201cpeople she was dealing with in the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nSo whatever Parnas and Fruman were doing about the ambassador happened long before the Ukraine call. Likewise, their campaign contributions happened before the call: a watchdog group filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) about Parnas, Fruman, and two unnamed \u201cJohn Doe\u201d co-conspirators in July 2018, a full year before the phone call between Trump and the new president of Ukraine, who would not be elected for another year.\n\nYet here is how the Associated Press explained the indictments Thursday: \u201cThe indictment contained the first criminal charges stemming from a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s leader to dig up dirt on Democratic foe Joe Biden and his son.\u201d First of all, Trump did not ask Ukraine\u2019s leader to \u201cdig up dirt.\u201d At the end of a long list of other requests, Trump asked him to work with the U.S. Attorney General and Giuliani to \u201clook into\u201d the circumstances in which Biden had the prosecutor fired while he was apparently investigating his son\u2019s company.\n\nSecond, the charges do not \u201cstem\u201d from the July 25 phone call. They appear to be independent.\n\nOne final note: the Southern District of New York has done this before, indicting former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen during the Russian \u201ccollusion\u201d investigation.\n\nThe media jumped to the wrong conclusions then. They are doing so again today.\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
