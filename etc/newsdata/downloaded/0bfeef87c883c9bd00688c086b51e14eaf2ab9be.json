REUTERS/Hannah McKay\n\nMore than 70 opposition lawmakers had challenged Johnson\u2019s right to suspend, or \u201cprorogue\u201d parliament, arguing it was illegal and unconstitutional because his intent was to force through a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31 by limiting the opportunity for opponents to object.\n\nJudge Raymond Doherty said the question was not a matter for judicial interference and was a political issue which should be judged by parliament and the electorate. He said it was up to parliament to decide when it sat.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, there has been no contravention of the rule of law. Parliament is the master of its own proceedings, rules and privileges,\u201d Doherty told Scotland\u2019s Court of Session.\n\n\u201cThis is political territory and decision-making which cannot be measured against legal standards and only by political judgements,\u201d he added.\n\nJoanna Cherry, a Scottish National Party lawmaker who led the challenge, said an appeal against the ruling would be heard on Thursday at Scotland\u2019s Inner House of the Court of Session.\n\nJohnson announced on Aug. 28 that he would suspend parliament from mid-September to mid-October, shortly before Britain is due to exit the EU on Oct. 31, so that his Conservative government could announce a new legislative programme.\n\nThe Scottish court was told on Tuesday that a memo passed to Johnson two weeks beforehand indicated he was looking to suspend parliament while his aides were publicly denying there were any such plans.\n\nThe case is one of three legal bids to stop the prorogation.\n\nBusinesswoman Gina Miller, who in 2017 successfully forced the government to get parliamentary approval before it formally issued Britain\u2019s divorce notice to the EU, is taking a challenge to London\u2019s High Court on Thursday, a case backed by former Conservative Prime Minister John Major.\n\nAnother case is due to be heard in Northern Ireland on Friday.\n\nCherry said she was hopeful her case would be successful on appeal, referring to the European Court of Justice\u2019s decision last December that Britain could unilaterally revoke its Article 50 notice to leave the EU following the \u201cWightman\u201d case she brought with other Scottish lawmakers.\n\n\u201cImportant to recall we lost the Wightman case on unilateral revocation of (Article 50) at 1st instance & went on to win it in Scotland\u2019s appeal court & in CJEU in Luxembourg,\u201d Cherry wrote on Twitter.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend parliament later this month until shortly before Britain leaves the European Union is lawful, a Scottish court ruled on Wednesday, saying the matter was not one for judges to decide.", "authors": ["Michael Holden", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426092614&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830SA"}
