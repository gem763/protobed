The sale marks the third time the team has changed ownership after being founded by Ewing Kauffman back in 1969. Glass purchased the team in 1999.\n\n\u201cThe decision to sell the Royals was difficult for our family,\u201d Glass, the former CEO of Walmart, said in the statement. \u201cOur goal, which I firmly believe we\u2019ve achieved, was to have someone local, who truly loved the game of baseball and who would be a great steward for this franchise going forward. In John Sherman we have found everything we were looking for in taking ownership of this franchise.\u201d\n\nSherman, a Kansas City-based entrepreneur initially made his riches in the energy sector, and is also a minority owner in the Cleveland Indians, which aided in Glass\u2019s decision to sell the team to someone with a passion for baseball.

His love for Kansas City and the game of baseball is well documented as are his philanthropic endeavors in the surrounding communities,\u201d said Glass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am enormously grateful to David and the Glass Family for this extraordinary opportunity and am humbled by the chance to team up with a distinguished group of local investors to carry forward and build on this rich Kansas City Royals legacy,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cOur goal will be threefold: to compete for a championship on behalf of our fans; to honor their passion, their experience and their unwavering commitment; and to carry their hopes and dreams forward in this great Kansas City region we all love - - - for decades to come.\u201d\n\nThe Royals last won the World Series in 2015. The team has failed to make the Major League Baseball playoffs since then.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The Glass family have officially sold the Kansas City Royals to a group of local investors following recent speculation and rumors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/Kansas-City-Royals.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
