Our key relationships are not, currently, in a state of flux, but Scott Morrison has signalled a distinctive approach for dealing with such a turbulent world, one with similarities to the Howard and Menzies eras.\n\nScott Morrison: \"We can never answer to a higher authority.\" AAP\n\nIn an address to a Lowy Institute dinner at Sydney Town Hall on Thursday night, he effectively queried a strong UN role in setting global policies to combat climate change and international protocols for allowing in refugees. Both are sensitive issues. The intra-Coalition climate change culture wars \u2013 pitting moderates against climate change denialists \u2013 played a significant role in the downfall of Mr Morrison\u2019s predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nMore than a year later, Mr Morrison told his Lowy Institute audience: \u201cWe should avoid any reflex towards a negative globalism that coercively seeks to impose a mandate from an often ill-defined, borderless global community. Only a national government, especially one accountable through the ballot box and the rule of law, can define its national interests. We can never answer to a higher authority than the people of Australia.\u201d\n\nWhile he briefly acknowledged Australia had played its part in building a more constructive world order through \u201cco-operative and respectful internationalism\u201d, he warned that pragmatic international engagement was being pushed aside by a new order that sought to \"elevate global institutions above the authority of nation states to direct international policies\".\n\nMorrison\u2019s foreign policy speech agenda contrasts with Labor, which has a long history of support for international covenants, particularly those framed by the UN. This dates back to the UN\u2019s founding conference in San Francisco in 1945, when Australia\u2019s then Foreign Minister, Dr H. V. (Doc) Evatt, was elected the new body\u2019s inaugural president and made the cover of Time Magazine.\n\nRarely as punchy\n\nThe Menzies government was more \"Morrisonian\" in its approach, although its language was rarely as punchy. However, it was subjected to numerous international rhetorical touch-ups over its strict adherence to the White Australia at various UN forums.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustralia\u2019s biggest era of global engagement was during the Whitlam Labor government years of 1972-75. It used a series of UN covenants covering the environment and human rights to assert a more international approach to issues and at the same time use the new powers to enforce a more centralised legal regime in Australia.\n\nNearly three quarters of a century after the UN San Francisco conference, Mr Morrison averred that \u201cthe world works best\u201d when \u201cthe character and distinctiveness of independent nations is preserved within a framework of mutual respect\u201d. This puts him firmly in the Howard-Menzies tradition, but the world has changed since then.\n\nAustralia\u2019s foreign policy challenges, like dealing with Washington and Beijing as they engage in a protean power struggle, are more complex and difficult. Further, his \"nations first, UN last\" approach sits uneasily beside his repeated call for China to abide by largely Western-mandated international trade rules and submit to its WTO status being changed from a developing to a fully developed economy.\n\nUnrest in Hong Kong remains a big distraction for China. Getty\n\nMorrison was delivering his Lowy Institute address not only as the US and UK are afflicted by political turmoil, but China, the third man in in this equation, is not immune, either. On the same day it displayed its military might in a 70th annual National Day show of force in Beijing, police shot a teenage protester in Hong Kong, and the former British Crown colony continues to be racked by unrest.\n\nMeanwhile, back at Bob\u2019s Market in LA\u2019s Echo Park, late night clues about its wider significance for Australia begin arriving in the unlikely form of hot-rod cars. They perform a series of illegal \"donuts\" on the traffic island with tyres screeching, then speed off into the night, leaving behind a maze of black skid marks.\n\nIt\u2019s their way of paying homage to The Fast and The Furious, an American action movie, TV series, live performance and comic book franchise that features a petrol-head\u2019s giddy brew of illegal street car racing, heists and spies. Iconic early scenes in The Fast and The Furious were shot in and around Bob\u2019s Market \u2013 hence the unusual late-night homage paid by LA\u2019s legion of hot-rod street racing aficionados.\n\nThe first of many Fast and Furious films was released in 2001 and the last is slotted for 2021. It\u2019s a nice little earner, too. Various Fast and Furious products have so far generated $US5 billion ($7.4 billion) in revenue for Universal Pictures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis nightly ritual at Bob\u2019s Market illustrates the grip of American popular culture. Rev-heads doing donuts in empty streets in Australian cities and country towns are common occurrences, as they are elsewhere. In fact, US popular culture is so embedded in the psyche of people in other countries that the original source for the influence is rarely acknowledged.\n\nAmerican movies have grabbed our imagination, going back to the founding of the first suburban cinemas in Australia in the '20s \u2013 from Charlie Chaplin to Hedy Lamarr. This popular culture invasion was accompanied by the jazz Age \u2013 Afro-American music that enthralled the world with its improvisation and syncopated rhythmic patterns.\n\nSince the war, those US movies, TV series, hit songs, rhythm and blues, jazz, casual clothes like blue jeans, fast food, and the gym craze, have spread far and wide. Collectively, they have moulded much of the world into America\u2019s image. Of course, elsewhere there is Shakespeare and Schopenhauer, Mozart and Modigliani, and countless others, but the US influence on global popular culture is undeniable.\n\nThe question being asked in Canberra is pretty much this: 'What does it mean for Australia?'\n\nAt such an uncertain time in world events, it\u2019s worth pondering the significance of US popular culture as a factor in Australia\u2019s foreign relations. The issue arises as a grumpy President Donald Trump thrashes around over the decision of the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives to launch an impeachment inquiry, the first step in a drawn-out process that could lead to Trump being forced out of office.\n\nAs claims and counter claims come thick and fast in Washington, the question being asked in Canberra is pretty much this: \"What does it mean for Australia?\" So far, the answers have focused on issues like whether the US will continue to be a major power in the western Pacific, will China overtake America in economic strength within 10-20 years, as many have forecast, and so on.\n\nBut the question never addressed is the role that US popular culture has in cementing our alliance with the US, an alliance that dramatically came into force as the Japanese military stormed through south-east Asia in early 1942, threatening Australia.\n\nAccording to the latest Lowy Institute poll, 52 per cent of respondents said they trusted the US to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d in world affairs, compared with only 32 per cent for China. The US figure is relatively low compared with earlier surveys, but still much higher than China\u2019s, even during the rancorous unpredictability of the Trump administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gap in local public perceptions of the US compared with China widens when just 30 per cent of respondents said they trusted China\u2019s all-powerful leader, President Xi Jinping, to do the right thing.\n\nMore recently, a Newspoll survey found that 56 per cent of respondents believe the relationship with the US is more important than ties with China, despite the enormous trade links with the Middle Kingdom. This compares with just one quarter of respondents who believe China should take priority.\n\nErratic behaviour\n\nThe usual explanation trotted out for public support for the US ties is the long security alliance, the fact that both countries are democracies, both are former British colonies, and have long-established connections through universities, think tanks, government departments and scientific organisations.\n\nAt a time of growing local alarm about the erratic behaviour of the White House incumbent, however, this explanation may be valid but it\u2019s limited. Ties are also underwritten by the popular cultural connection. China may have a rich history in calligraphy, silks, highly stylised painting of rural scenes, crockery and food. But Peking Opera just doesn\u2019t cut it against B.B. King, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Alicia Keys, Chuck Berry and Lana Del Ray.\n\nAnd that\u2019s before those rev-heads start doing donuts opposite Bob\u2019s Market in Echo Park, LA.", "description": "Bob\u2019s Market, a classic American general store facing a large traffic island in a run-down Los Angeles neighbourhood called Echo Park, is a bizarre place to start exploring the state of Australia\u2019s foreign relations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9819%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/977d7973dafbd8d1e055775e5e7551af81f02ba3", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
