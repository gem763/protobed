The administrators of that operation similarly used fake accounts to post about topics such as celebrities, show business, sports and news, in addition to \u201cpolitical and economic issues including Ukrainian elections, political candidates and criticism of various public figures,\u201d Mr. Gleicher said.\n\nFacebook has connected the Ukrainian campaign to Pragmatico, a Ukrainian PR firm, and said it purchased around $1.6 million worth of ads on Facebook and Instagram, he added. Pragmatico could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nNearly a year left in the 2020 U.S. presidential race, Facebook\u2019s latest disclosure came amid the company facing scrutiny over concerns with the possibility of its platforms being abused to influence voters.\n\nFacebook previously acknowledged that millions of American users were subjected during the last White House race to content and ads shared on social media by fake personas operated by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian \u201ctroll factory\u201d accused of interfering in the election, and U.S. government officials have repeatedly warned recently that next year\u2019s race risks coming under a similar attack.\n\n\u201cWe are making progress rooting out this abuse, but as we\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s an ongoing challenge. We\u2019re committed to continually improving to stay ahead. That means building better technology, hiring more people and working more closely with law enforcement, security experts and other companies,\u201d Mr. Gleicher said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
