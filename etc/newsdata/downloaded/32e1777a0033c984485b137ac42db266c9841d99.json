Well, the American people deserve to know this president, this vice president, and these House Republicans will always stand for the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke had what many saw as a breakout moment Thursday when he spoke passionately about the need for gun control in the wake of recent mass shootings \u2014 including one in his hometown of El Paso \u2014 and advocated for a buyback program.\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re gonna take your AR-15, your AK-47, and we\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against your fellow Americans anymore,\u201d the former congressman from Texas said.\n\n[\u2018My AR is ready for you,\u2019 Texas Republican lawmaker tells Beto O\u2019Rourke over mandatory buybacks]\n\nO\u2019Rourke emphasized Friday morning as he made the rounds on cable television shows that his buyback plan would be \u201cnot voluntary.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is mandatory,\u201d he said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cIt will be the law. You will be required to comply with the law.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats fretted, however, that O\u2019Rourke had handed Republicans a campaign issue at a most unfortunate time: as they try to push President Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and other Republicans to adopt more modest reforms, such as expanding background checks for gun purchasers.\n\n\u201cI frankly think that that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying, \u2018Democrats are coming for your guns,\u2019\u201d Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) said during an appearance on CNN. \u201cI\u2019m a gun owner. My sons and I have gone skeet shooting and hunting, and, frankly, I don\u2019t think having our presidential candidates, like congressman O\u2019Rourke did, say that we\u2019re going to try and take people\u2019s guns against their will is wise either.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a majority of the Senate or the country is going to embrace mandatory buybacks,\u201d Coons added. \u201cWe need to focus on what we can get done.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke has been an outspoken proponent of stricter gun-control measures, including mandatory buybacks, in the wake of the Aug. 3 shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, where the gunman was armed with an AK-style rifle and killed 22 people. But his forceful \u201chell yes\u201d on Thursday night became one of the most memorable lines of the presidential debate and drew heightened attention to idea.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the Baltimore retreat, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the House conference chairwoman, said talk of gun confiscation would \u201cabsolutely\u201d motivate voters to cast ballots for Republicans.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely clear that there\u2019s one party here that absolutely will make sure that we are defending the Second Amendment, defending Americans\u2019 constitutional rights, and there is another party \u2014 and you\u2019ve seen it with the Democrats \u2014 who really have no care and no concern about the Second Amendment,\u201d she said.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) weighed in as well, asserting that O\u2019Rourke was \u201cgetting more desperate and more radical\u201d by embracing mandatory buybacks of assault weapons.\n\n\u201cYou know, the idea that he\u2019s going to go and take people\u2019s guns is a dangerous concept, and it shows he has a lack of understanding of the Second Amendment,\u201d Scalise said.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s embrace of mandatory buyback \u201cshows the contrast\u201d with Trump, whom he characterized as \u201ca president who looks at a problem and tries to find a solution.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy pointed to legislation signed by Trump last year to shore up reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and the administration\u2019s move to ban bumpstocks, the rapid-fire gun attachments used to kill 58 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas in October 2017.\n\nMcCarthy said he expected Trump to come forward \u201cquite soon\u201d with a new package of measures developed in the wake of last month\u2019s back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio.\n\n\u201cHe wants to gather all the information first and make sure whatever we move forward solves a problem so that none, none of this happens again,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nIn his television appearances on Friday, O\u2019Rourke argued that his call for a mandatory buyback program would not imperil Democrats politically.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a concern of mine, and that\u2019s in part informed by listening to people in conservative parts of America and the southwestern part of Virginia,\u201d he said on CNN.\n\nO\u2019Rourke recounted a visit to Bland County, Va., \u201cas conservative as it might be, as proud a gun owner as they might be, they\u2019re talking about this issue. And folks are saying, \u2018Look, I would give up that AR-15 or that AK-47. I don\u2019t need it to hunt, don\u2019t need it to defend myself in my home.\u2019 They recognize this is a weapon designed for war, to kill people as effectively, as efficiently, and in as great a number as possible.\u201d\n\nAntonia Noori Farzan and Kayla Epstein contributed to this report.", "description": "Vice President Pence, others in the GOP sought to paint Democrats as overly eager to confiscate firearms in the wake of Thursday night\u2019s presidential debate.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MmJ5EAYpJiACRKIOPFDMPYsXZ2w=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E7IK4ZGWJQI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
