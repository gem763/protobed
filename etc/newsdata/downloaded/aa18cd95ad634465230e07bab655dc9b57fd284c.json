With products such as sheds and grills that are bulky, expensive to deliver and sometimes complicated to assemble, the sector has failed to achieve significant online penetration.\n\nBut as the era of Amazon reshapes consumer expectations about same-day and low-price deliveries, retailer-owned cooperative Ace Hardware Corp. is shifting its bricks-and-mortar focus to make a big bet on e-commerce in the name of survival.\n\nFounded nearly a century ago, Ace supplies and supports more than 5,000 privately owned hardware stores across the globe. The company plans to spend billions in the coming years to expand its e-commerce capabilities, including a recently launched buy-online-deliver-from-store service.\n\nSome analysts question the viability and cost of such an effort. Each local Ace store owner possesses a small-business autonomy from the retailer-owned cooperative\u2019s corporate branch, and more than half of them have yet to embrace the company\u2019s online-delivery vision.\n\nBut Chief Executive John Venhuizen believes the local focus of his company gives it an edge over bigger competitors such as Home Depot Inc. and Walmart Inc., which also are spending billions to shorten the time it takes to reach any home with a delivery, no matter the size.\n\nThe 49-year-old Mr. Venhuizen spoke with The Wall Street Journal about his strategy. Edited excerpts follow.\n\nWSJ: How do you see Ace maintaining its market share in a changing industry against larger companies like Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, as well as the increasing threat of disruption by Amazon?\n\nMR. VENHUIZEN: In order for us to win, we\u2019ve got to wage a battle on three fronts.\n\nThe first is service. Having local stores with local ownerships who live in, work in, and know that community better than anyone at corporate ever will is a huge strategic advantage to us.\n\nThe second is convenience, and what we\u2019re trying to do is exploit the geographic proximity advantage we have. Versus everyone you just mentioned\u2014Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s, Amazon\u2014we have a lot more stores. We have 5,200 stores around the world in more than 67 countries, and more than 75% of U.S. households are within 15 minutes of an Ace store. We\u2019ve got about $2 billion of inventory sitting right in the neighborhoods.\n\nThe third is quality. We have a fanatical devotion to locally relevant, high-quality products that are different than what you can get at some of the competitors you just mentioned.\n\nWSJ: Six years ago, you said the bricks-and-mortar focus of Ace was how the company would succeed, and that you weren\u2019t looking to \u201cout-Amazon the Amazons.\u201d Has that focus changed?\n\nMr. Venhuizen and Ace Hardware recently introduced a buy-online-deliver-from-store service.

VENHUIZEN: We\u2019re betting the farm on what we know is a timeless principle\u2014that serving hearts and human connection will always have the potential to stir a soul. So how do we apply that principle? We recently launched nationally BODFS, which is a goofy industry term that stands for Buy Online, Deliver From Store. We are actually leveraging our local stores, their inventory, their vehicles and\u2014here\u2019s the key point\u2014their people to do the delivery to their neighbors.\n\nThere isn\u2019t some random who-knows-who delivering the product to whip onto your porch.\n\nWSJ: Why do you think consumers care about who\u2019s actually delivering an item to their door?\n\nMR. VENHUIZEN: The person delivering the product knows what the product does, how to use it, how to start it, how to season it in. That matters. Now, sometimes it may be far less relevant, but the greater the degree of complexity, the more important the degree of knowledge.\n\nWSJ: Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot do offer their own delivery, installation and haul-away services, as well as some pre-assembled grills, things of that nature. What makes Ace\u2019s delivery offerings different than that?\n\nMR. VENHUIZEN: We have more stores than the two of them combined. So the proximity to the homes and businesses is a significant advantage.\n\nThen, two, the delivery is actually done by the employees who work in those stores. So it isn\u2019t outsourced to a cobbled-together, third-party strategy. It\u2019s actually done by the employees who work in the store.\n\nWSJ: As a retailer-owned cooperative, store owners have to opt into doing this delivery service, and many aren\u2019t participating yet. Why do you think that is?\n\nMR. VENHUIZEN: It\u2019s operationally really difficult to execute, and you see retailers all over the world struggling with that last mile.\n\nI think we have about 2,100 or 2,200 stores now that are fully executing [the buy-online-deliver-from-store service] from Acehardware.com. Almost every Ace-branded store is doing some form of delivery on their own, and as they operationalize that, they\u2019re waiting until it\u2019s excellent before they integrate with online because the volume is starting to surge.\n\nWe\u2019re helping them with that as best we can, but some of them still feel like they have a way to go.\n\nWSJ: How much of the online delivery integration cost does each local store have to bear, versus costs that are covered by corporate?\n\nMR. VENHUIZEN: The operational expense is burdened by the local Ace store.\n\nWSJ: Has that been a factor in some store owners being reluctant to integrate and participate right now?\n\nMR. VENHUIZEN: I\u2019d say the operations, more than the expense itself, is the issue. You\u2019ve got an operation that\u2019s heavily dependent on people. And they\u2019re very reluctant, rightfully so, to ever pull those people off a floor because they want them serving customers.\n\nWSJ: You said around 2,100 or 2,200 Ace stores are participating in online delivery now, which means that more than half of Ace stores world-wide still haven\u2019t hopped on board. Since people who live in those areas can\u2019t get delivery from Ace, is that a competitive disadvantage against Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s?\n\nMR. VENHUIZEN: For those stores in those markets, yes. The majority of them are doing in-store pickup, however, which we\u2019ve been doing for a decade, for free.\n\nBut yes, I think it\u2019s to their detriment to not get on and do it, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re feverishly figuring that operation out to do so.\n\nWSJ: E-commerce analysts point out that a challenge for the hardware and home sector is that some items are large and bulky and some have a do-it-yourself assembly aspect that might discourage some people from wanting to order online. Why do you think that now is the time for Ace to invest a lot of money in an e-commerce delivery system?\n\nMR. VENHUIZEN: You just identified it: a gaping hole in the digital platform of e-commerce. And it\u2019s exactly where most of our growth digitally is coming from\u2014big, bulky, obnoxious product is the vast majority of the stuff we\u2019re doing online [70% of online delivery orders]. And again, I think it speaks to the value of bricks-and-sticks and local people.\n\nAn example is grills. Ordering a grill on some discount website and having it shipped to your home: One, it\u2019s going to cost a fortune in many cases, but then you\u2019ve got to deal with it. How do you put it together? We will deliver and assemble those grills to our local customers for free on any grill over $399.\n\nWSJ: Amazon clearly got in the game early with online delivery and convenience for shoppers as a general business model. Walmart, Home Depot and many other companies are pumping billions of dollars into trying to fortify a similar system to what you are putting together in the e-commerce area. Are you playing a game of catch-up right now?\n\nMR. VENHUIZEN: I would readily admit that Amazon has redefined what convenience means to a consumer. Unquestionably. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing a lot of these things I just talked to you about.\n\nIt\u2019s only doubled down our commitment to have high-quality, locally relevant, differentiated products, and we feel really fortunate to have a lot of the stuff we sell require a human being to show you how.\n\nA great example is paint. We just announced a national exclusive relationship with Benjamin Moore paint. You can only get it at independent, local stores [non-chain retailers not limited to Ace], and now nationally, within the next several months, will be available at every Ace.\n\nAce Hardware has more stores than Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot combined.

I\u2019m not saying that won\u2019t sell online. Heck, we sell online. We do a lot of paint that way, but the majority of it requires a human being to have their eye connect the color chip, play around with some color samples, and then a human being to show them how to paint it, what tools they\u2019re going to need to do it well, and then to physically mix the color they\u2019ve selected.\n\nWSJ: A lot of these new offerings from Ace, like free in-store pickup, seem to be the bare minimum needed to stay relevant in the changing retail industry. How is Ace faring as it plays catch-up?\n\nMR. VENHUIZEN: Everyone is chasing after in-store pickup now, or curbside delivery, and I think it\u2019s right.\n\nConsumers are demanding it, retailers have to do it. Where we\u2019re going to end up having an advantage is that the consumer still wants that to be convenient. So how many stores you have and how large they are is massive. We have 4,500 stores [in the U.S.] that, on average, are 10,000 square feet, and most of our competitors have stores that are 10 times bigger than that. Which, by nature of the size of their parking lot, the size of their store, makes them a little less convenient.\n\nWSJ: How big of a future cost are you going to incur in terms of fortifying your inventory for delivery, or internal technology required to route things and get them places as quickly as possible?\n\nMR. VENHUIZEN: We plan to spend north of $2 billion over the next five years to fuel the strategy I just articulated for you.\n\nWSJ: I went through the steps required to order a $13 hammer to my home from a local Ace store, and the shipping cost for standard delivery was $7.71. The two-day shipping cost was $15.88, and the express shipping cost was $21.25. Do you see this as a reasonable delivery rate, and is the company working to find ways to cut down those costs?\n\nMR. VENHUIZEN: They\u2019re totally unreasonable. And it\u2019s why the two biggest strategies are, one, pick it up in the store for free, and then second, if you want it delivered, our equivalent of a Prime membership is, become an Ace Rewards member for free. And then you get anything you order over $50 delivered for free, all the time.\n\nWSJ: Do you think the hardware and home sector is less vulnerable to disruption by online competition than other sectors are?\n\nMR. VENHUIZEN: We feel so fortunate to be in the business we\u2019re in. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anyone in Silicon Valley that\u2019s working on an app that\u2019s going to make people not want to have a roof over their head.\n\nNow, we have some competitors that are very good in home renovation. If you want to spend $40,000 to redo your kitchen and countertops and appliances and all that, they\u2019re very good at that. We\u2019re more predominantly focused on home preservation: $40 on paint to spruce up the way the kitchen looks, or to fix the hinges, or to fix the faucet. To maintain, preserve and restore the best, biggest asset you already have.\n\nAnd I\u2019d never say it was recession-proof. But it certainly is recession-resistant. If the economy\u2019s bad and your toilet doesn\u2019t work, you need to fix it and we\u2019re going to be there to show you how and give you the tools to do it.\n\nMr. McGee is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.
