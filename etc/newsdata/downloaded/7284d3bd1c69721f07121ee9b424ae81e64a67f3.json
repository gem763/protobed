I remember when I didn\u2019t want anyone to look at me. I remember when I was scared of people, scared of men.\n\n'I remember when I was scared of the world.

This pioneering procedure was the first of its kind to be done in a single operation.\n\nAfter the operation, Katie was put into an induced coma for 12 days. She has since been through more than 200 surgical operations to treat her injuries.\n\nWriting in the National Geographic last year, she said: 'It\u2019s been a decade since I survived a sulfuric acid attack that left me with severe burns across my face, in the following years, I\u2019ve worked to redefine my sense of identity.\n\n'With injuries such as mine, your face can be so damaged that your expressions may not convey how you feel, and you may even lose your ability to smile.\n\n'It can be an isolating experience, you feel one way on the inside but look completely different on the outside, after more than 200 surgeries since my attack, I\u2019ve accepted that my old face is gone.'", "description": "The presenter, now 35, suffered life-changing burns to her face and neck after jealous ex-boyfriend David Lynch recruited Stefan Sylvestre to target her in a pre-planned street attack.", "authors": ["Jason Chester For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/16/19547708-0-image-a-94_1570722795451.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
