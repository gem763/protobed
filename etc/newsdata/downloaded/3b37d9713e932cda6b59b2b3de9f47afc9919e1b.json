Or maybe he yelled. Whatever came out of Scherzer\u2019s mouth, after he fired a 98-mph fastball to Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr., was an audible sign that the Washington Nationals ace is getting back to normal. The pitch was a ball. Acu\u00f1a eventually walked. But the result of the plate appearance didn\u2019t matter. What mattered \u2014 now, sure, but really for the Nationals\u2019 pennant chase \u2014 is that Scherzer was putting everything he had into each of his 98 pitches against the Atlanta Braves on Sunday.\n\nHe gave up one run on two hits in six innings of the Nationals\u2019 9-4 win at SunTrust Park. He struck out nine. He even added a single in the seventh, poking it inside the right field line, and scored on an Adam Eaton double. Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera chipped in four hits and three RBI. That all helped the Nationals sidestep a sweep after dropping three straight here. It put them three games ahead of the Chicago Cubs for the top National League wild-card spot. And, more than anything, it was the best Scherzer has looked since he came off the injured list Aug. 22.\n\n\u201cIt was full throttle,\u201d Scherzer said, adding that he could have thrown another inning and up to 110 pitches. \u201cFrom beginning to end. I felt good even coming out.\u201d\n\n[Box score: Nationals 9, Braves 4]\n\nThis was the 35-year-old\u2019s first matchup with the Braves this season, and it was also the first time since May 11 that he pitched to catcher Yan Gomes. Kurt Suzuki, Scherzer\u2019s usual catcher, is day-to-day after he exited Saturday night\u2019s loss with right elbow pain. He also felt tingling in his fingers. An MRI exam Sunday revealed nothing beyond inflammation, a relief for the Nationals. But he and Manager Dave Martinez didn\u2019t want to risk it, considering what is at stake in the coming weeks, and that nudged Gomes into the lineup.\n\nGomes, an all-star in 2018, has had a disappointing year at the plate. He entered Sunday with a .213 batting average in 290 plate appearances. Then he stepped into a Mike Soroka change-up in the second and sent it over the fence in left-center field. Soroka, 22, has been the Braves\u2019 best pitcher this season. But he couldn\u2019t keep the Nationals in the yard early on. Eaton popped a two-run shot in the first to give Scherzer a quick lead. Gomes added his an inning later. Juan Soto followed in the third with his 33rd of the year, lifting an outside sinker off the left field foul pole. The three homers were the most Soroka has allowed in a game this season.\n\nThat was more than enough for Scherzer, who yielded a solo homer to Matt Joyce in the second before blanking the Braves for his final 4\u2154 innings. Scherzer went through his normal between-starts routine for the first time since he returned from the injuries. This was his fourth appearance following a six-week recovery for a mid-back strain, bursitis in the scapula below his right shoulder blade and a mild rhomboid muscle strain in the same area. He had predicted he could throw around 100 pitches at full strength against Atlanta. Martinez, who has carefully managed expectations for Scherzer all summer, admitted Sunday morning that Scherzer \u201chas no limits.\u201d\n\nThe results backed Martinez up.\n\n\u201cI think [Scherzer] is back to where he feels like he can throw any pitch at any time,\u201d said bench coach Chip Hale, who met reporters after the game because Martinez was ejected along with Trea Turner in the fifth for arguing balls and strikes. \u201cHe can step on that gas pedal when he needs to.\u201d\n\n[Nationals call up Tres Barrera with catcher Kurt Suzuki feeling elbow pain]\n\nScherzer\u2019s first strikeout came on a 96-mph fastball to Ozzie Albies. His second, six pitches later, was with 97-mph heat to Freddie Freeman. It was just off the high-and-outside corner of the strike zone. When Scherzer is going well and attacking hitters how he wants to, that exact spot and that kind of velocity are big reasons. Batters were fouling it off in his previous three outings. Freeman, one of baseball\u2019s best hitters, couldn\u2019t catch up.\n\nScherzer finished with 54 four-seam fastballs on the afternoon, and added effort increased the spin rate of that pitch. His command was shaky for moments and he issued two walks, but he felt he was just missing his spots. He was able to mix all five of his pitches in all counts. That\u2019s what makes him so dominant. The unchained intensity is the final ingredient.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just frustrated it took this long,\u201d Scherzer said of feeling back to 100 percent. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting this to happen a lot quicker than the way it has been and [have been] doing everything to make it happen.\u201d\n\nThe Braves put runners on second and third with one out in the fourth. Scherzer had walked Josh Donaldson before Joyce smacked a double into the right field corner. But Scherzer struck out the next two hitters, with a slider and a fastball, and set down the last eight batters he faced. His final out, for good measure, was a no-look catch on a liner ripped right back at him by Donaldson.\n\nHe was next part of the Nationals\u2019 four-run seventh. Gomes started it with his second homer of the game and ninth of the year. Scherzer followed with a single, scrambled out of the batter\u2019s box and stole second when the Braves didn\u2019t pay attention to him. He soon scored on Eaton\u2019s double, jogging around from second, and offered swinging high-fives to teammates. Scherzer looked like he had never gone anywhere. He looked just like the player Washington needs him to be.", "description": "Sunday\u2019s game was the best Scherzer has looked since he came off the injured list.", "authors": ["Jesse Dougherty", "Reporter Covering The Washington Nationals.", "September At Pm", "Jesse Dougherty Covers The Washington Nationals."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CSNe-10nbGry5VN_LXFXQWwWNo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D3GJU4GSOQI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
