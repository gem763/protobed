Vindman\u2019s testimony, what he heard on the President\u2019s call, that conversation with the Ukrainian leader was so concerning that he worried it might undermine US national security. Does it concern you? Are you worried about the President\u2019s behavior at all?\u201d the reporter asked McConnell.\n\nIn response, the GOP Senate leader answered a different question, one that was never asked, about charges from some of Trump\u2019s supporters that Vindman might not be patriotic because he was born in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna question the patriotism of any of the people who are coming forward,\u201d McConnell volunteered.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics Mitch-Mcconnell-Impeachment-Inquiry"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
