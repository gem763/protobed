The Gunners failed to produce a telling response to Lys Mousset\u2019s 30th minute goal, plundered from inside the six-yard box, after Emery\u2019s side failed to defend a corner.\n\nHaving impressed in the cup competitions this season, many Arsenal fans expected Tierney to make his Premier League debut at Bramall Lane but the summer signing from Celtic remained on the bench with Sead Kolasinac maintaining his place.\n\nRob Holding was another unused substitute, while Hector Bellerin failed to make the matchday squad altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked whether his best defenders have been left out of his Premier League starting XI, Emery said: \u2018We are improving defensively. We\u2019re receiving less goals.\n\nRob Holding was an unused substitute against Sheffield United on Monday (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to achieve the best defensive solution with one group of players\u2026 It\u2019s for all the players.\u2019\n\nThe pressure on Emery is intensifying with an inconsistent start to the season following on from last term\u2019s capitulation which culminated in a 4-1 defeat against Chelsea in the Europa League final.\n\nClub legends Alan Smith and Paul Merson have accused Emery of failing to make any discernible improvements on the team which finished sixth under Arsene Wenger during his final season at the Emirates.\n\nAsked if his current team were better than Wenger\u2019s class of 2018, Emery replied: \u2018In my career it\u2019s normal to have difficult moments and criticism for our work and my job. We are in one point of view. The supporters point of view and their opinion, we need to accept that.\n\n\u2018We need to think how we can, little by little, progress and achieve our targets. Immediately that\u2019s to win. Really we are at the beginning. In this competition we won two matches and played very well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We lost a very big opportunity in the Premier League to finish third in the table. We are five and have chances on Sunday. We have to get better but it\u2019s one process.\n\n\u2018Our strategy is \u2013 when I was watching in my office \u2013 we changed 10 players. 40 per cent more or less. We are using new players, above all also some young players to give them chances more quickly.\n\n\u2018The most important is the club and team. Our objective is clear on where we want to get. I am very confident in the players, in our job, in our work, in the club strategy and in our way.\u2019\n\nMORE: Arsenal legend Alan Smith explains how Frank Lampard is making life tougher for Unai Emery\n\nMORE: Arsenal issue Reiss Nelson injury update ahead of Europa League clash against Vitoria", "description": "Unai Emery insists he intends to utilise all of his defenders in a bid to patch up his leaky rearguard and will not rely on Kieran Tierney, Rob Holding and...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-11741732452_1571836593.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
