That she\u2019s also the first YouTube creator to land such a coveted gig is just further proof of how network television is relying on a younger, diverse, and more online pool of talent to remain vital and relevant in the ever shifting world of entertainment.\n\nSingh doesn\u2019t want people to forget who she is and where she came from. Last night, the debut episode of her show, A Little Late with Lilly Singh, opened with a video starring Singh rapping about not being like the \u201cother Jimmy\u2019s\u201d on late night right now. The video, which is similar to the rap parodies that helped make her a star on YouTube so many years ago, acts as a reminder that she\u2019s different from what network TV has relied on for so many years \u2014 she\u2019s a YouTuber.\n\nAmid waning viewership, networks are learning to go where younger audiences are. Late night hosts create sketches designed to play perfectly on YouTube. There\u2019s lip syncing, musical covers, funny challenges, and even \u201cstory time\u201d plays that hosts like Jimmy Fallon and James Corden have become known for producing. Even the way in which late night interview segments are later distributed on YouTube \u2014 in chunks and by specific topics \u2014 is a strategy many YouTube creators have used.\n\nSingh isn\u2019t a classic choice for late night, and that\u2019s the point. She doesn\u2019t come from performing seasons of Saturday Night Live, an acting background, or even from an MTV series like her colleagues do. Instead, she has the type of dedicated fan base that will tune into every new video she publishes. Her world is YouTube, and that\u2019s exactly what NBC needs. Singh not only has the best idea of what will work on YouTube after doing it for more than a decade, but also comes with a built-in audience of 14 million fans. Applying her YouTube expertise to late night, and building that brand even more, is what NBC is leaning into.\n\n\u201cYouTube was a huge fuel for late night, and late night really leaned into YouTube with some of them doing web exclusives,\u201d Stephen, who goes by his first name for his analysis channel Coffee Break, told The Verge. \u201cEspecially if late night wants to appeal to a younger audience. YouTube is the main place where you want to be.\u201d\n\nLate night television is more popular now than it\u2019s been in years, with a spike following the election of Donald Trump, but ratings are still slipping. Jimmy Fallon\u2019s Tonight Show lost 9 percent of its viewership last season, according to Vulture. Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s Jimmy Kimmel Live! dropped by 10 percent. Even Stephen Colbert, who saw one of the largest growths in viewership between the 2016 election and now, is also seeing a decline in viewers. It has less to do with Colbert, Kimmel, or Fallon\u2019s talents, and everything to do with how people are watching late night today. As Vulture\u2019s Josef Adalian noted, \u201cyounger viewers are fleeing network (and cable) TV at a far faster clip than audiences over 50.\u201d\n\nSingh is a step in a more modern direction for NBC, a network that\u2019s seen firsthand what going viral and being part of the day-to-day conversation can do for boosting late night\u2019s presence. Fallon\u2019s Tonight Show is consistently mentioned in Vulture late night recaps, and interview clips can feel ubiquitous on YouTube\u2019s Trending page. Seven percent of content on YouTube\u2019s Trending page is regularly dedicated to late night, according to a study on 18 months of Trending data that Stephen of Coffee Break conducted earlier this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insane when you think of it,\u201d Stephen said. \u201cEvery time you clicked on the Trending tab, if there were 100 videos, roughly seven of them were late night show clips.\u201d\n\nSingh\u2019s show will carry some of the classic late night staples. There will be a monologue and interviews with guests. She\u2019ll have a desk where she sits and a house DJ. But Singh isn\u2019t trying to appeal to the same audience who might tune into Stephen Colbert to catch his biting political commentary. She's largely staying away from day-to-day politics altogether. Instead, Singh is going to lean into what makes her special \u2014 and what found her a YouTube audience so many years ago.\n\nThat means more sketches and monologues about topics other late night hosts can\u2019t touch, like what it\u2019s like to grow up in Canada with immigrant parents from India. It may not be as appealing to middle America as Fallon or Corden (something she acknowledges in her rap video and monologue), but it\u2019s uniquely her. Bringing that type of authenticity to the show, and staying true to the person her YouTube fans know her as, is vital to maintaining her audience online.\n\nAppealing to a growing online audience is also something NBC wants to try, and it\u2019s part of why they picked Singh for the 1:35AM ET time slot formerly occupied by Carson Daly. \u201cWe use this 1:35AM slot as a creative playground for someone to build a show that we know isn\u2019t a linear ratings play \u2014 this is a relevancy play, this is a digital play,\u201d George Cheeks, NBC Entertainment co-chairman, told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nNetwork executives have been rethinking their approach to late night TV since the early 2010s. Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon helped usher in a new era of YouTube-friendly content between 2009 and 2012 when their respective channels launched, and other shows followed suit. By 2015, NBC and ABC signed deals with YouTube that would allow them to sell pre-roll ads on their various late night clips, ensuring additional monetization. YouTube suddenly became an important business play. In 2016, channels like Fallon\u2019s were seeing north of 250 million views a month, thanks to collaborations with celebrities like Ariana Grande. Late night hosts and their teams stopped thinking of YouTube as an afterthought.\n\nGoing from being on YouTube to working with YouTubers was, seemingly, the next logical step for a network. Singh, someone who might have helped a video from Fallon or Kimmel perform better in the past, is now at the center. It\u2019s a testament to Singh, and YouTube\u2019s status as a star maker, that NBC is ready to take this leap, but it won\u2019t come without some push and pull on both ends. NBC knows how to run a successful late night show, but Singh knows what people on YouTube want when they click on a video.\n\n\u201cWhen you go into network TV and there\u2019s a bunch of people telling you how you should be, there\u2019s a reason that doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nThere will be some struggles along the way that come with going from creating for YouTube to broadcast networks, including heavier restrictions. Singh recognizes that it\u2019s something she doesn\u2019t have to \u201cdeal with on my YouTube channel,\u201d as she told the Los Angeles Times. Still, if she\u2019s successful, it could present an opportunity for other YouTube creators looking to jump into mainstream projects.\n\nBalancing both live and online audiences will be crucial to the show\u2019s success; it\u2019s not going to be a ratings blockbuster at 1:35AM, but it can be a YouTube hit. What makes YouTube creators so beloved among their fan bases is different from what people like about traditional comedians and actors. As Singh told the Los Angeles Times, \u201cthe reason us creators are so successful on YouTube is because we\u2019re very authentic.\u201d If NBC wants Singh to bring her audience to late night, the message is clear on her part: let her be.\n\n\u201cWhen you go into network TV and there\u2019s a bunch of people telling you how you should be, there\u2019s a reason that doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she said.", "description": "Lilly Singh is the first queer woman of color to get her own late night talk show on a major network, and one of the youngest late night hosts in NBC history. \"A Little Late with Lilly Singh\" is proof that the worlds of YouTube and mainstream are colliding faster than ever before.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ls4mLShLl7OaQd9X_8bbya8j1No=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19206188/1168696878.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
