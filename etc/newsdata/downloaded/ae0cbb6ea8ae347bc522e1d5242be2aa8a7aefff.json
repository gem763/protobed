REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\n\nPANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm at the centre of the \u201cPanama Papers\u201d scandal, has filed a lawsuit against Netflix, accusing the video streaming heavyweight of defamation in a new movie based on the case and seeking to stop its immanent release.\n\nThe Panama Papers, which consist of millions of documents stolen from Mossack Fonseca and leaked to the media in 2016, provoked a global scandal after showing how rich and powerful clients including Russian President Vladimir Putin and soccer superstar Lionel Messi used offshore corporations to evade taxes.\n\nNetflix film \u201cThe Laundromat\u201d stars Gary Oldmann and Antonio Banderas as the two Mossack Fonseca partners at the centre of the scandal, Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca, and is scheduled to be released on Oct. 18.\n\n\u201cIn its movie... (Netflix) defames and portrays the plaintiffs (Mossack and Fonseca) as ruthless uncaring lawyers who are involved in money laundering, tax evasion, bribes and/or other criminal conduct,\u201d according to a copy of the 42-page lawsuit seen by Reuters.\n\nThe suit was filed in U.S. federal court in Connecticut on Oct. 13. Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the official trailer for \u201cThe Laundromat,\u201d which co-stars Meryl Streep as a widow investigating insurance fraud, the following question is asked and answered in big, bold type: \u201cHow do 15 million millionaires in 200 countries stay rich? With lawyers like these.\u201d\n\nThe trailer then cuts to the elegantly dressed lawyers played by Oldmann and Banderas laughing uproariously.\n\nMossack Fonseca shut down last year after being accused by U.S. prosecutors of helping clients conceal assets, investments and income from government tax authorities using a wide range of sham foundations and shell companies.\n\nWhile Mossack and Fonseca also did not respond to requests for comment, a source close to them told Reuters that both lawyers maintain their position that the massive leak of the firm\u2019s internal documents consisted of \u201cinformation theft or hacking\u201d that was illegal.", "description": "Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm at the centre of the \"Panama Papers\" scandal, has filed a lawsuit against Netflix, accusing the video streaming heavyweight of defamation in a new movie based on the case and seeking to stop its immanent release.", "authors": ["Elida Moreno", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441595262&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1UO", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
