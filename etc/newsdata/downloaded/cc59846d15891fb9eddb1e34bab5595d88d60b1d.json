Heineken declined to comment.\n\nThe chairman of the CCI, Ashok Kumar Gupta, and other members of the commission are expected to decide on a penalty over the next few months, or dispute the investigation findings which were submitted in August, the two sources said.\n\nThe report will not be made public and its findings have not previously been reported.\n\nThe three brewers, who according to IWSR Drinks Market Analysis account for about 85% of beer consumption in the $7 billion (\u00a35.5 billion) India market, together face a potential fine of around $280 million, sources told Reuters last year.\n\nAny company executives found to have fixed prices could also be fined, though AB InBev could escape its share of the fines as it first reported the issue.\n\nIn cases such as this the next step would typically be for the companies to argue over penalties, with the CCI deciding on the extent of the leniency to be shown, said Gautam Shahi, a New Delhi-based antitrust lawyer who is not involved in the case.\n\nAfter an internal investigation in 2017, AB InBev reported its detection of industry collusion under the CCI's so-called \"leniency programme\" that provides a whistleblower-type protection for cartel members.\n\nThe disclosures came after it discovered the Indian operations - which it acquired through its purchase of SABMiller Plc - had for years fixed beer prices with Carlsberg and United Breweries.\n\nCarlsberg and United Breweries have also filed leniency applications in the case, Reuters has reported, though it is not clear how the CCI treated those submissions.\n\nSeparately, AB InBev is battling a city-wide ban in New Delhi for alleged evasion of state taxes, which the company denies.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Jan Harvey)", "description": "The investigations unit of India's Competition Commission has concluded that Anheuser-Busch InBev , Carlsberg  and United Breweries  colluded to fix beer prices, two people with direct knowledge told Reuters.
