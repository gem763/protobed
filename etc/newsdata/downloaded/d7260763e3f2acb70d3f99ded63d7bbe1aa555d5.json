And Sarah Kaplan describes a \u2018Super Earth\u2019 110 light-years away.\n\nPost Reports is the daily podcast from The Washington Post. Unparalleled reporting. Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nDangerous hot zones spread across the world\n\nThe entire global ocean is warming, but some parts of it are changing much faster than others \u2013 like a hot spot off Uruguay that was first identified by scientists in 2012. There, researchers have observed mass die-offs of clams, dangerous ocean heat waves and algal blooms, and changes in Uruguay\u2019s fish catch.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe South Atlantic region is part of a global trend: Around the planet, enormous ocean currents are traveling to new locations. As they relocate, waters are growing warmer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cScientists have basically correlated the clam decline and a lot of other things that have happened at the same time with the really quick warm-up of temperatures that have happened in this region,\u201d says environmental reporter Chris Mooney\n\n\n\n\n\nHe and data reporter John Muyskens have been examining how temperatures have changed around the world since the late 1800s.\n\n\n\n\n\nMooney, along with photographer Carolyn Van Houten , met clammers directly affected by climate change in Barra del Chuy, Uruguay. Out on the sand, the harvesters demonstrated how difficult it has become for them to maintain their traditions and livelihoods as the clams die out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople essentially live off the fruits of the sea,\u201d Van Houten says. \u201cThat\u2019s a very long-standing thing for people to do. But it has received quite a jolt in this region. And it\u2019s not clear that it will ever be the same.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018There is a fear that anything less than the safe choice would lose the election\u2019\n\nOn Thursday, Democratic presidential candidates who were able to pull 130,000 unique donations and poll at least 2 percent in four polls will meet on the debate stage in Houston.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019ll be the first time top-polling candidates Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders share the stage and the only night of debate for the 10 qualifying candidates this month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are not five stragglers who think they\u2019re going to burst into the top by attacking a frontrunner,\u201d says political reporter David Weigel . \u201cThe debate you might see instead would be about the sale-ability, politically, or the realism of a couple of different plans.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWeigel says the candidates who poll behind the top three will have to prove they\u2019re electable before voters narrow their lists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe tug-of-war that people are having onstage does not reflect with voters who just want to be convinced that, \u2018Okay, if I vote for the person I like best, will they not blow it? Because I\u2019m scared of what happened last time,\u2019 \u201d Weigel says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Not a vacation destination\u2019: Scientists discover \u2018Super Earth\u2019 a mere 110 light-years away\n\nUsing the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists have found a potentially habitable \u201cSuper Earth\u201d planet with water in its atmosphere \u2013 and possibly (likely) on its surface. K2-18b is large and rocky and closely orbits a dim red star just 110 light-years away in the constellation Leo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs strange and alien as this place seems, this exoplanet is now considered a really great target to search for life beyond our planet,\u201d says science reporter Sarah Kaplan\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Chris Mooney, John Muyskens and Carolyn Van Houten on the dangerous hot zones spreading around the world.
