We could get married,\u201d three of the characters burst out laughing at such a crazy idea.\n\nThe year was 1955. The Daughters of Bilitis (named after a fictional contemporary of Sappho) was the first political and social lesbian society in America, and Mal is loosely based on Del Martin, who with Phyllis Lyon, started the first chapter of the organization. They were the first same-sex couple to be married in San Francisco.\n\nAt the time, being gay was a crime, and women wanted to be able to go somewhere besides a bar where a raid could mean being arrested.\n\nPlaywright Patricia Cotter said she wanted to imagine what happened during that first meeting.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t seen a play or a history of my people. I loved thinking about a time that changed the world because women wanted to meet each other. Isn\u2019t that wild?\u201d she said at a caf\u00e9 near her house in the Castro . \u201cAlso, I feel like Phyllis and Del haven\u2019t gotten their due as civil rights leaders. And I wanted to see a bunch of women onstage having a blast.\u201d\n\nThe same actors from the first act of The Daughters appear in the second. Now it\u2019s 2015, and they\u2019re at the last night of San Francisco\u2019s last lesbian bar, The Lexington Club. One character, Gina, angry that there is no bar left for lesbians, has scant patience for Ani, a young woman who has never been to a lesbian bar before, meeting women online instead.\n\nShe calls the Lexington \u201cquaint\u201d and finds the word femme \u201ctired,\u201d and lesbian \u201coldy timey.\u201d When asked what comes to mind when she hears the word, Ani says \u201cPony tail, softball, golf, knee brace\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have any that are not sports injury-related?\u201d another character, Leslie, asks.\n\nTo write the second act, Cotter talked to trans men and women along with lesbians and gay men and people who identify as gender-fluid (as Ani does) trying to get different points of view.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff that pokes at people, which is interesting. The language is changing so quickly, and some people are put out at how things are changing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, change is change\u2014why not get on board with all of it? The reality is if me not being assumptive about pronouns means that I\u2019m making other people comfortable, why is that a big deal?\u201d\n\nDirector Jessica Holt says she thinks the different perspectives Cotter got in her interviews add a lot to the play.\n\n\u201c Language has changed and there\u2019s a host of specific identity terms whereas in the 50s it was all lesbians and gays, and butches and femmes. Now our understanding is not so binary \u201d\n\n\u201cAni represents the millennial generation with a fluid approach to identity and sexuality times,\u201d Holt said. \u201cLanguage has changed and there\u2019s a host of specific identity terms whereas in the \u201950s it was all lesbians and gays, and butches and femmes. Now our understanding is not so binary.\u201d\n\nTo research the first act, Cotter visited Brooklyn\u2019s Lesbian Herstory Archives, where they had mimeographed copies of the DOB newsletter, The Ladder, and she spent time at the GLBT Historical Society in San Francisco where she saw a letter the writer Lorraine Hansberry had written to The Ladder. Cotter based a character in the play on Hansberry.\n\nKey to her research was Marcia Gallo\u2019s book, Different Daughters: A History of the Daughters of Bilitis and the Rise of the Lesbian Rights Movements.\n\nNow a history professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Gallo says she was working for the American Civil Liberties Union in California when she met Martin and Lyon at a meeting in the \u201980s. They supported her idea to write about the DOB for her dissertation topic, she says.\n\n\u201cThey said men don\u2019t get it right\u2014it takes a lesbian,\u201d Gallo said. \u201cThey opened their Rolodex to me and gave me names and addresses of members and cosigned a letter that I had their support.\u201d\n\nThe organization was unique in its dual focus on women\u2019s rights and lesbian rights, Gallo said, when there was lots of sexism in the gay rights movement and homophobia in the feminist movement.\n\n\u201cThey were so creative and committed around civil rights, and they reached out to women of color,\u201d Gallo said about Lyon and Martin. \u201cThey kept going and helped organize meetings with candidates pressing them on gay issues. Their contributions are huge.\u201d\n\nWhenever Gallo comes back to San Francisco, she visits Lyon, who at 94 lives in the house in San Francisco\u2019s Castro district she shared with Martin.\n\nCotter also met with Lyon, who she describes as a \u201cdelight.\u201d Cotter brought her laptop, intending to take notes, but then decided rather than grilling Lyon, to just \u201cabsorb the energy\u201d of being with her in the living room where DOB meetings were held.\n\nThe house is an amazing place, says Shayne Watson, an architectural historian who runs the GLBT Historical Society\u2019s Historic Places Working Group.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective as an architectural historian, it should be a historical landmark,\u201d she said. \u201cThat site gives me goose bumps.\u201d\n\nPeople look to 1969, when patrons fought back against a police raid at Greenwich Village\u2019s Stonewall Inn as the beginning of the gay rights movement, Watson says, but the DOB was hugely significant as well.\n\nWatson helped to get landmark status for an early San Francisco gay bar, the Paper Doll, and she saw the closing of the Lexington (the first lesbian bar she went to) as significant as well.\n\n\u201cIt was felt as a giant blow to the community, \u201cshe said. \u201cIt was a loss of an inclusive, welcoming public space where people could meet each other.\u201d\n\n\u201c There was so much shame, and people didn\u2019t know they had any rights at all. Part of the reason the meetings were so important was to get information out, so at least you know your rights \u201d\n\nA safe place to meet each other was the driving force for the DOB, Cotter says. In the first act of The Daughters, the women panic when there is a knock on the door (it turns out to be another guest). In a raid, women could be charged with prostitution or conspiracy to commit sodomy. If arrested, your name and address were published in the paper, which meant many of the women lost their jobs and maybe their families. Cotter read about a woman who was released after Martin told her to plead not guilty, but that was rare, she says.\n\n\u201cThere was so much shame, and people didn\u2019t know they had any rights at all,\u201d Cotter said. \u201cPart of the reason the meetings were so important was to get information out, so at least you know your rights.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, Holt had never heard of the DOB before. Working on the play, she and Cotter talked about the importance of knowing this history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really civil rights history,\u201d Cotter said. \u201cI\u2019ve also seen a ton of theater where we hear about the gay male perspective, and I\u2019m a huge fan of it, but I would like to be included, and not just one character with one point of view, but a broader narrative and just kind of show there\u2019s a million different ways to be a queer woman.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI hadn\u2019t seen a play or history of my people,\" says Patricia Cotter\u2014so she wrote \u2018The Daughters\u2019 which evokes a grand sweep of lesbian history, including the Daughters of Bilitis.", "authors": ["Emily Wilson"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572098395/191027-wilson-the-daughters-hero_i1vawm", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
