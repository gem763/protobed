Few get away with it, but Ibrahimovic generally gets a shrug or a laugh.\n\nBut when asked whether he\u2019ll be returning to the team for his 39th year on this earth, the Swedish star\u2019s impishness was too dismissive and disrespectful even for his standards (and even if there was truth in some parts of what he said).\n\nFrom NBCLosAngeles.com:\n\n\u201cThis could be my last game. Let\u2019s see what happens. Is that more important than who is winning the MLS [Cup]? Yes, yes it is,\u201d later adding, \u201cImagine if I don\u2019t play in the MLS. Who will you talk about then?\u201d \u201cWhen you play, you want to get credit back for when you\u2019re playing. \u2026 I did my best. I think everybody did their best. What happens next year, I don\u2019t know. If I stay, I think for MLS it\u2019s good because the whole world will watch it. If I don\u2019t stay, nobody will remember what MLS is.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThere were other slights. He played down the raucous LAFC atmosphere by comparing it to \u201ctraining for me\u201d and calling the stadium \u201ctoo small.\u201d He asked if MLS had the money to resign him, and claimed he made both LAFC and Carlos Vela famous?\n\nFew would\u2019ve wanted or expected gracious loser Zlatan, but it\u2019s one thing to John Lennon yourself as the most important thing in the league and another thing to trash it altogether.\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of thing that makes you hope the 31-goal scorer doesn\u2019t return \u2014 he\u2019s been linked with Napoli \u2014 even though of course you\u2019d prefer him return. The conversation Friday could\u2019ve been about how the Galaxy wasted him with an inferior supporting cast to its standards, but instead there\u2019s just a sour taste in our mouths.\n\nHe won\u2019t care, and probably won\u2019t spend another thought on it, but it\u2019s distressing because Ibrahimovic was (is?) very good for MLS and reports of his positive off-field contributions to the Galaxy club were not alien at all. If this is his exit and plays a role in how he\u2019s remembered, that\u2019s too bad.", "description": "\"If I stay, I think for MLS it's good because the whole world will watch it.\"", "authors": ["Nicholas Mendola"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0RkcJ56_6fAP2d0_OrFxqg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjAuNjQ-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kB_5s_2pV6qgKq75XE6uLg--~B/aD01NjM7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/a57df6015af9a314992902c8afb49539", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
