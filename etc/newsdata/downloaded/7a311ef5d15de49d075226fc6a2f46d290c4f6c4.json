Plaintiff intends to oppose, arguing that exceptions to such privileges apply.'\n\nMayorga's legal team have argued these documents are a valid part of the case.\n\nAmerican model-turned-teacher Mayorga claimed the football star raped her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009 after the pair met on a night out and she agreed to go back to his hotel room.\n\nLater in the document, Ronaldo's lawyers claim that the footballer 'does not believe such documents are without alteration'\n\nWhile police failed to find enough evidence to prosecute Ronaldo, Mayorga is pressing ahead with a civil case which seeks to nullify a non-disclosure agreement she signed with the athlete in 2010.\n\nShe claims his legal team exploited her vulnerable mental state in order to get her to sign the document.\n\nIn court papers filed in August, Ronaldo's legal team acknowledged for the first time that Mayorga was paid $375,000 at the time she first made the accusations to police in order 'to maintain the confidentiality of their dispute.'\n\nHowever, they note that the payment in no way acknowledges guilt, and that in fact 'the [agreement] made clear Mr. Ronaldo disputed [Mayorga's] allegations and in no way conceded she was injured.\n\n'To the contrary, the [agreement] stated in no uncertain terms that Mr. Ronaldo was agreeing to pay [Mayorga] a sum of money in order to maintain the confidentiality of their dispute.'\n\nRonaldo was the subject of a criminal probe in Nevada after former model Kathryn Mayorga (pictured together) went public last September with claims she was sexually assaulted by the footballer\n\nRonaldo's lawyers argue that the previous agreement and Nevada's statue of limitations make Mayorga's lawsuit null and void.\n\nThey also say she has yet to present any concrete evidence that she 'lacked mental capacity' when she signed the NDA.\n\nLast October, Ronaldo said: 'I firmly deny the accusations being issued against me. Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything I am and believe in.'\n\nHis mother Dolores has stuck by Ronaldo throughout the months-long investigation, saying in February that she had 'confidence in my son when it comes to what happened'.\n\nThe civil lawsuit, in which Mayorga sought more than $200,000 in damages, was been moved to federal court in August. She has since requested a jury trial in the case.\n\nPolice could not conduct 'any meaningful investigation' at the time because Mayorga declined to say who assaulted her or where it occurred, US prosecutors said.\n\nAs a result, detectives were 'unable to search for and impound vital forensic evidence,' and video showing Ronaldo and Mayorga together was lost, they added.\n\nMayorga contacted police in August of last year to ask that the case be reopened, at which point she named Ronaldo as the alleged assailant.\n\nHer lawyers have said she was inspired to speak out and make her claim public by the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment.", "description": "In new documents,\u00a0Cristiano Ronaldo's legal team asked the United States District Court for Nevada for certain exhibits to be 'entirely stricken' from court records.", "authors": ["Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/15/19887856-0-image-a-4_1571409077199.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
