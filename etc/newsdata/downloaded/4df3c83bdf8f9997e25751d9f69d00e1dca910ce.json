(Reinhold Matay/USA Today Sports)\n\nIn his 2,300-word essay announcing that he\u2019s bisexual, NFL free agent Ryan Russell covered a lot of ground: his football career, his family, the blogger who almost outed him and the pressure to announce his sexual orientation to anyone and everyone who might want to know.\n\n\u201cHave I lied to teammates, coaches, trainers, front-office executives and fans about who I am?\u201d Russell wrote for ESPN.com last week. \u201cNot exactly. But withholding information is a form of deceit.\u201d\n\nThe notion that LGBTQ people are being dishonest if they don\u2019t reveal their sexual orientation is as old a concept as \u201ccoming out of the closet,\u201d a metaphor that since the early 20th century has described people revealing their sexualities. Decades later, activists say many LGBTQ male athletes still feel they have to vocalize their sexual orientations or gender identities to be fully authentic.\n\nThis burden of announcing their sexual orientations is a type of shame that heterosexual people impose on LGBTQ people, said Wade Davis, a former NFL player who is now vice president of inclusion in product for Netflix. Most people assume that others are heterosexual because it makes them feel safe not to have to police their own actions and words, Davis said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a selfish act to demand that someone declare their sexuality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not take into consideration at all what the other person might be going through.\u201d\n\n[There\u2019s no one \u2018gay gene,\u2019 but genetics are linked to same-sex behavior, new study says]\n\nThe pressure for LGBTQ people to declare their sexual orientations is slightly stronger on men\u2019s sports teams than in other fields, Davis said. Teammates are physically and emotionally vulnerable with each other, he said, and they bond by discussing their personal lives.\n\nWhen a professional athlete does reveal his sexuality, Davis said, he becomes known as \u201cthe gay athlete.\u201d After former University of Missouri defensive end Michael Sam said he was gay in 2014, people saw him as \u201cthe gay football player\u201d \u2014 as opposed to \u201ca football player who happens to be gay\u201d \u2014 because they struggled to perceive being both gay and a professional athlete as normal, Davis said.\n\nAt the highest levels of men\u2019s sports in the United States, few athletes openly identify as LGBTQ. In addition to Sam, then-NBA player Jason Collins publicly revealed he was gay in 2013. With his essay for ESPN, Russell became the only openly LGBTQ male athlete on a U.S. professional football, basketball, baseball, hockey or soccer team.\n\nThe lack of out athletes burdens those who have not revealed their sexuality to do so in a public way, just as a member of any underrepresented group may feel pressure to do something that could be transformative for other people, Davis said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tacit ask that if you\u2019re a gay male who\u2019s playing in one of the big five [sports], that you come out because it can change things for a lot of people \u2014 specifically for LGBTQ folks,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAnd that demand has merit, but that demand takes away a person\u2019s individuality.\u201d\n\n[An exchange between Lil Nas X and Kevin Hart went viral. But maybe not the way \u2018The Shop\u2019 had hoped.]\n\nChris Mosier, a triathlete who identifies as a transgender man, said LGBTQ athletes often change the pronouns of a romantic interest they are talking about or speak vaguely to avoid disclosing their sexual orientations. They might tell people they went to see a movie, for example, but intentionally not say who went with them.\n\nProfessional athletes, Mosier said, face some pressure from fans and news reporters to be open about their identities, especially because they have the platform to be role models for LGBTQ young people. Other athletes want their professional lives only to center on what they are doing on the field, Mosier said. Many LGBTQ athletes are \u201cout\u201d to their teammates, he said, but not to the broader public.\n\nIn Mosier\u2019s experience, transgender people more frequently encounter backlash for not immediately disclosing their identities than lesbian, gay or bisexual people do. Transgender people \u2014 particularly transgender women of color \u2014 are also disproportionately likely to be killed.\n\nIn 2016, Cyd Zeigler, the founder of LGBTQ sports news website Outsports, sparked backlash when he told The Washington Post that athletes who withheld their sexual orientations were choosing \u201ccowardice over courage.\u201d Zeigler eventually apologized for labeling closeted athletes as cowardly.\n\nPressure to share their sexual orientations more often arises from non-athletes than from professional athletes who already have come out, said Ashland Johnson, founder of the Inclusion Playbook, a project working to make sports more inclusive. This burden derives from the public\u2019s feeling of ownership of professional athletes, Johnson said.\n\n[To some, this queer couple look straight. For him, that\u2019s okay. But for her, it feels \u2018like a lie.\u2019]\n\nAlthough people often judge athletes who do not disclose their sexual orientations, Johnson said, \u201cWe don\u2019t think people are being deceitful if they don\u2019t declare themselves left-handed.\u201d\n\nThe general assumption is that male athletes are straight, so those athletes are unlikely to risk their careers by saying otherwise, said Hudson Taylor, executive director of Athlete Ally, which works to create LGBTQ-inclusive athletic environments. Since athletes\u2019 careers last only about five years, Taylor said, male LGBTQ athletes often are willing to hide a part of themselves to protect their ability to earn a living. Male athletes typically retire or are not offered contracts after they come out.\n\nStill, Taylor said LGBTQ athletes continue to be burdened with the knowledge that sharing this highly intimate part of themselves could make life a little easier for the LGBTQ young people who might look up to them.\n\n\u201cBecause we are still living in an era of firsts, there is a tremendous amount of pressure for LGBTQ athletes to be that first,\u201d Taylor said, \u201cwhether or not their personal life, their family life [or] their athletic career would be put at risk because of that decision.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThe victim in Stanford sexual assault case is going public with her identity\n\nConversion therapy center founder who sought to turn LGBTQ Christians straight says he\u2019s gay, rejects \u2018cycle of self shame\u2019\n\nRepublican LGBTQ rights group\u2019s executive director is the latest to leave after its endorsement of Trump\n\n\u2018Crazy Rich Asians\u2019 writer says she is leaving because of pay disparity with white male co-writer", "description": "In an essay announcing that he's bisexual, NFL free agent Ryan Russell wrote that withholding his sexual orientation had felt like \"deceit.\"", "authors": ["Marisa Iati", "General Assignment", "Metro Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ScfWb780jOFnUNMENkQpVfDlqxc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TSSH3SWKYUI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
