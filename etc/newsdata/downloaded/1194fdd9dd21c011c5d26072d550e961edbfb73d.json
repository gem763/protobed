Huh? What? And how would you even get them inside the machine?\n\nHowever, it turns out laminating your eyebrows is actually a sensible-sounding proposition.\n\nAnd no, it doesn\u2019t literally involve giving them a wipe-clean coating.\n\nEssentially \u2018lamination\u2019 involves fixing unruly brows into place, so they won\u2019t droop or stray from their new, perfect position - for EIGHT WEEKS.\n\nActing like a supercharged clear brow gel, it promises groomed arches that look fuller naturally, even without make-up.\n\nBy making eyebrows feathery, full and defined, it's being talked about as an alternative to microblading without the expense or risk of being stuck with a bad result.\n\nIf you\u2019re older, this magical fixative even claims to give a mini face-lift by elevating saggy brow hairs, opening up the eyes and creating a sharper frame for your entire face.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nHaving heard the sell, I reckoned I could be the perfect candidate for lamination.\n\nIn the list of first world beauty problems, \u2018Eyebrow Droop\u2019 must rank pretty highly, but it\u2019s nevertheless niggled me for years.\n\nLeft to their own devices, my brows divide like Brexit Britain, their hairs parting halfway down into two directions.\n\nI\u2019ve tried brow gel, hair wax, even max-hold hairspray to coax them together, but by lunchtime the chasm has opened once more.\n\n\u2018Well, lamination is going to solve all that,\u2019 says Natalie Piper from Lash Perfect, who are offering the treatment in over 50 salons nationwide.\n\n\u2018Basically it\u2019s a way of restructuring your brow hairs so they sit in a perfect uniform direction,\u2019 she explains.\n\n\u2018First, we use an adhesive to brush your brows into the exact shape you want. Then we use two solutions to break down the bonds in your hair and set them in place.\u2019\n\nSo it\u2019s like a\u2026 perm then?\n\n\u2018Well, er, yes,\u2019 she concedes (obviously \u2018perm\u2019 doesn\u2019t sound as Insta-cool as \u2018lamination\u2019).\n\nThe benefits of the treatment also bring to mind another untrendy term: comb-over.\n\n\u2018Lamination is ideal if you\u2019ve got any gaps in your eyebrows as you brush your own hair over to cover them,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018If you\u2019ve got sparse brows, it\u2019s a great way of maximising what you\u2019ve got.\u2019\n\nBrows, beaten?\n\nIt only takes around 30 minutes to get myself laminated.\n\nMy brows are cleansed, then brushed and glued into place, at which point I\u2019m invited to check their new positioning.\n\nOnce approved, there\u2019s the unmistakable waft of perming solution as my brows are remodelled and left to set (my mind flashes back my frizzy 80s hair disasters but I\u2019m assured lamination isn\u2019t damaging).\n\nJust to be on the safe side, though, the treatment ends with a keratin mask to condition my eyebrows before they\u2019re combed through and presented for inspection.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe droopy half of my eyebrows has perked up immensely.\n\nRather than being split in two, my brow hairs now flow in a lovely, uniform arch, cleverly disguising the threadbare patch left from an overzealous threading session years back.\n\nThey already look thicker on their own, but Natalie recommends I add a brow tint as the icing on the cake.\n\nThe next morning, I awake from my slumber \u2013 face-planted in the pillow as usual \u2013 and am delighted to see my brows are still beautifully upright.\n\nLike any hair that\u2019s been permed, they need a quick brush for neatness, but the basic shape is set.\n\nGiven the price and the lack of risk, I personally think this treatment is better than microblading, assuming you have enough of your own brow hairs to make it work.\n\nLamination might be a ludicrous name, but I reckon it\u2019s here to stay \u2013 just like my new eyebrow shape.\n\nLamination need-to-know\n\n*There\u2019s no patch test involved\n\nAfter the treatment, you need to keep your eyebrows dry for 24 hours, but there\u2019s no other aftercare beyond brushing them into place.\n\n*Lamination complements rather than replaces brow make-up\n\nIn the same way that clear brow gel does a different job to a coloured brow pencil.\n\n*The result lasts 6-8 weeks, depending on how quickly you shed your hairs\n\nIt\u2019s natural to lose hairs, and obviously the new ones won\u2019t magically start growing in the same direction as the laminated ones.\n\n*When your brows are being glued into place, you can choose the shape you prefer\n\nYou can go for a classic arch or a more fashion-y brushed-up look.\n\nLash Perfect Hi-Brow Lamination costs from \u00a335, see Lashperfect.co.uk", "description": "This new microblade alternative treatment claims to tame unruly brows and leave them looking full, defined and beautifully shaped for months with no effort.
