The 55-year-old actor sought support following his September 2016 split from Angelina Jolie, who filed for divorce after an alleged confrontation about Pitt\u2019s drinking aboard a private plane with their children.\n\nThough Pitt declined to explicitly address the break-up \u2014 \u201cI had family stuff going on,\u201d he said of his work in the upcoming Ad Astra \u2014 he acknowledged that his issues with drinking had come to a head.\n\n\u201cI had taken things as far as I could take it, so I removed my drinking privileges,\u201d he explained.\n\nView photos Brad Pitt joined Alcoholics Anonymous after his split from Angelina Jolie.

So you open up those boxes.\u201d\n\nView photos Pitt's drinking reportedly contributed to his split from Angelina Jolie, pictured with the actor in 2009.
