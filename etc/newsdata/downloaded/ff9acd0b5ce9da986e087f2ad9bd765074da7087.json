The divorce was not as amicable as he may have hoped.\n\nAntonio Conte will be the pantomime villain as he faces old side Juventus in the Derby D'Italia\n\n'Conte the Pope' read one banner as he delivered three league titles successively at Juventus\n\nThe Telegraph reported at the time that upon returning to Turin for a game against England, Conte allegedly received death threats from fans angry at his rigorous training regime.\n\nClaudio Marchisio was injured on international duty and was out for a period where Juventus badly needed him. The blame lay at Conte's door - the first sign of how fierce criticism can be when you are not sat in the dugout in Turin.\n\n'I can't just let some things slide as if they didn't happen,' he said in response, clearly irked by the extreme behaviour. 'Some things stay. They wounded me.'\n\nBut provided he did not take the Inter Milan job his reputation, largely, would be secure. His status as one of the club's all-time great coaches would not be under threat.\n\nOnly he did join Inter. He did cross the divide that some feel must never be crossed. And in the first Derby D'Italia of the 2019-20 season, he is fixated on derailing his old side's bid for a ninth straight title - and strengthening his own title challenge over at the San Siro.\n\nAfter all, it was Conte who started the club's run to eight titles in a row; he would love nothing more than to rip up the foundations he laid back in 2011-12.\n\nThe move to Milan led some of Juventus' ultras to call for Conte's star in the Hall of Fame to be removed. In an instant, emotions heightened when it was announced he would return to Serie A with Inter. All of his achievements, depending on who you speak to, in Turin had conveniently been forgotten.\n\nConte was a cult hero player for the Old Lady where he went on to play more than 500 games\n\nHe was adored as a manager, also, but popularity has waned in some parts since he departed\n\nBut those who worked under him refuse to believe he has turned his back on where he came from. Turned his back on the club where he was - and in some cases still is - adored.\n\n'What really did upset and hurt me was seeing some Juve fans calling for Conte's star in the hall of fame to be removed after he joined Inter,' Gianluigi Buffon admitted to Correire dello Sport earlier this season.\n\n'I feel that I am within the Juve world, I know the directors, players and fans well, so I know what Antonio gave to the club and what he represented. He squeezed out every last drop of sweat for Juve, giving all of himself.\n\nANTONIO CONTE'S RECORD VS INTER AS JUVENTUS BOSS October 29, 2011: Inter 1-2 Juventus March 25, 2012: Juventus 2-0 Inter November 3, 2012: Juventus 1-3 Inter March 30, 2013: Inter 1-2 Juventus September 14, 2013: Inter 1-1 Juventus February 2, 2014: Juventus 3-1 Inter\n\n'As a player, he never held back for the good of the team. As a coach, he carried the squad on his back and dragged them to success with total clarity and never stopping for breath. In three packed seasons, he never once let his focus slip.'\n\nThat was a ringing endorsement by one of Juventus' all-time great players but still there were those who felt betrayed.\n\nAdmittedly there are those who simply couldn't care less; managers come and go and fans who spoke to Sportsmail were split on where they stand.\n\nWhile one described it as 'like George Graham going to Tottenham' others merely played it down, keen to not let a former manager dictate the narrative for their club.\n\nRav Gopal, prominent Juventus blogger, summed it up when he said: 'Some are bitter, some want him written out of the club's history, some simply don't care and some just want to humiliate him at Inter in the derby.'\n\nIt was not always like this, Juventus sweeping up all the major honours in Italy.\n\nInter fans of a certain age will remember the 1960s when they became an immovable force both domestically and in Europe and when the tide began to shift to their northern rivals in recent decades, the Derby D'Italia became arguably the fiercest fixture in Italy for both sets of fans.\n\nSteeped in success, Conte's time at Juventus as a player and manager was bathed in trophies\n\nConte took charge of six derbies during his time managing the Old Lady - he never once lost at the San Siro, the venue of Sunday's match.\n\nIn fact of the six matches he took charge of, he lost just once, winning four and drawing the other.\n\nAll that is now, though, is history. Conte wants to write his own and that starts on Sunday.\n\nInter haven't won a home Derby D'Italia in Serie A for nine years - a sign of Juventus' overwhelming dominance in this fixture.\n\nBut it is what is happening now that will concern the management, the players and the fans and it makes blissful reading for Inter. Six games, six wins, 13 goals scored and just two conceded.\n\nJuventus are not quite Bambi on ice but still look uncertain on their feet as they adapt to the demands of Maurizio Sarri. A 0-0 stalemate away at Fiorentina showed they have work to do now they have a genuine rival in Conte's Inter.\n\nSimply put he is - perhaps alongside Carlo Ancelotti - the finest manager in the league and both clubs know it.\n\nConte (left) got Juventus' historic title run started in 2011-12 but is now ready to end it this year\n\nIf Conte (right) delivers Inter Milan a league title, there could be a mutiny from Juventus fans\n\nHe's won it all in Italy before and having been backed heavily over the summer to add Romelu Lukaku, Valentino Lazaro, Matteo Politano, Nicolo Barella, Stefano Sensi and Alexis Sanchez, Inter have a title-winning team again.\n\nTheir first big test comes on Sunday against Juventus and while the mood is not totally sour at Conte, win the game and lead Inter to a title, there could be a mutiny on his hands.\n\nThe man who built the house is ready to tear the whole thing down.", "description": "Three successive Serie A titles had elevated him to Pope-like status in Turin among some sections of the fan-base having already been a club legend as a player but that is all at risk now at Inter.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/09/19327200-0-image-a-70_1570262511365.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
