Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer affecting women in Australia. In 2015, 1,365 new cases were diagnosed in Australian women. In 2016, 938 deaths were attributed to ovarian cancer across the nation. The five-year survival rate for ovarian cancer is 45 percent, with a one in 85 chance of being diagnosed before the age of 85.

Ovarian germ cell tumour is a general name used to describe several different types of cancer which forms in the egg cells of the ovary. Ovarian germ cell tumours usually occur in teenage girls or young women, and most often affect just one ovary. The most common form of ovarian germ cell is dysgerminoma.

You never know, and you're always better to be safe than sorry.'", "description": "Sydney mother Tracey Wilson, 39, has shared the warning signs of cancer every woman should know after doctors found a 27cm tumour on her ovaries in 2003.", "authors": ["Alice Murphy For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/06/19723624-0-image-a-17_1571117464983.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
