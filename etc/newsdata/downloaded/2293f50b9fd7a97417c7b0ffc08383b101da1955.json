Three instances of him appearing in blackface or brownface \u2014 the last known one occurring in 2001, when he was 29 years old \u2014 have come to light. This has tarnished his public image and reputation, and led some voters to question his integrity, authenticity and credibility in leading the nation.\n\nYet, it\u2019s fair to say Canadians have long had mixed opinions about Mr. Trudeau. John Ivison\u2019s book, \u201cTrudeau: The Education of a Prime Minister,\u201d adeptly analyzes a public figure viewed as a \u201cpolitical lightweight\u201d who \u201ccame across as a frivolous person with no fixed principles.\u201d While he\u2019s led \u201ca team of able people, many more able than himself,\u201d the author concludes Mr. Trudeau \u201centered politics as a man of promise but has emerged as a man of promises that have failed to materialize.\u201d\n\nMr. Ivison worked at The Scotsman newspaper in Edinburgh, Scotland, and has been a political columnist for Canada\u2019s National Post since 2003. Living in Ottawa, the nation\u2019s capital, he\u2019s fortunate to have a bird\u2019s eye-view of the PM and his caucus. This enables him to witness the successes and failures of the Liberal government, and catch the occasional gossipy tale in restaurants and local watering holes.\n\nMr. Trudeau was born in 1971. He\u2019s the son of the late Pierre Trudeau, Canada\u2019s 15th prime minister. It goes without saying \u201chis father was the yardstick against which Trudeau judged himself \u2014 then and, most likely now.\u201d Although he expressed no interest in politics while his father was alive, the speech he gave at his funeral in 2000 changed hearts and minds. As Mr. Ivison describes it, the eulogy was \u201can audacious performance \u2014 overwrought, to be sure, but replete with the three legged stool of Aristotelian rhetoric: ethos, pathos, and logos.\u201d\n\nHe would be aided in his political journey by several people. Gerald Butts, the \u201crazor-sharp son of a Cape Breton coal miner\u201d who he met at university, became his closest and most trusted political adviser \u2014 and later, principal secretary in the prime minister\u2019s office. There\u2019s also Sophie Gregoire, a TV/radio host who he married in 2005. Politics has reportedly never been one of her passions, and Mr. Trudeau has previously admitted their marriage \u201cisn\u2019t perfect and we have had difficult ups and downs.\u201d Nevertheless, her counsel and their relationship remains a critical facet of his life.\n\nMr. Trudeau would win a seat in Parliament in 2008. Few initially regarded him as an astute politician, but a high-profile charity boxing match in 2012 against then-Conservative Sen. Patrick Brazeau became a game changer. He was declared the winner, and Mr. Ivison writes it gave Liberals \u201ca victory over the Conservatives \u2014 the first in a very long time.\u201d As strange as it may seem, pugilism led him to becoming the new Liberal leader the following year.\n\nBeating the Conservatives in 2015 was even more flabbergasting. Prime Minister Stephen Harper had been in power for almost a decade, and was an intelligent and highly respected political leader. Yet, the Liberals \u201coutflanked the NDP on social policy and outbid the Conservatives on taxes\u201d and Mr. Trudeau performed \u201cbetter than expected\u201d in the leaders\u2019 debates. He created an \u201cimpressive and diverse\u201d team of candidates, and presented himself as a party leader representing \u201coptimism and change.\u201d\n\nBut as Mr. Ivison\u2019s book shows, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s charmed political life and supposedly enlightened views could only protect his vapid exterior for so long. Cracks began to appear in the inexperienced Liberal facade, based on an \u201cill-prepared\u201d entourage and the PM\u2019s smarmy, self-righteous nature. The \u201cchameleon prime minister,\u201d as the author calls him, could only change colors so often \u2014 and, if you\u2019ll pardon the pun, started to fade to black.\n\nHere are some examples. Relations with U.S. President Donald Trump started off poorly when Mr. Trudeau told \u201cone the planet\u2019s most various deal-makers that Canada was willing to renegotiate NAFTA.\u201d He uses public money \u201cas if it were his own to burnish his reputation.\u201d He and Finance Minister Bill Morneau \u201cembraced the \u2018class war\u2019 rhetoric with enthusiasm,\u201d in spite of Liberal MPs opposing this strategy. He\u2019s had the ignominy of two major ethics violations, and high-profile disputes with female MPs, while in office \u2014 and never apologized.\n\nAfter perusing Mr. Ivison\u2019s book, readers will have a better understanding of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s education as a prime minister. He should not only receive failing grades, but should seriously consider going back to school to learn what he should already know.\n\n\u2022 Michael Taube is a frequent contributor to The Washington Times.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nTRUDEAU: THE EDUCATION OF A PRIME MINISTER\n\nBy John Ivison\n\nSignal/McClelland & Stewart, $27.95, 368 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
