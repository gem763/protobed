Not what's politically correct, and not what's commercially correct. Just what's right.\"\n\n\"If any of our employees tweeted what she tweeted, they'd be immediately terminated,\" Iger added, telling his colleagues to tell him if they thought he was \"crazy.\" No one pushed back.\n\nThe \"Roseanne\" revival was more popular than \"Big Bang Theory.\" ABC\n\nBefore Iger brought up the idea to fire Barr, the choices on the table ranged from \"a suspension and loss of pay to a severe warning and public rebuke.\" Iger wrote he didn't think that was enough.

Don't blow it.\"\n\nAt the time, the \"Roseanne\" revival wasn't only ABC's biggest hit, it was also the biggest show on TV.\n\n\"I never asked what the financial repercussions would be, and didn't care,\" wrote Iger. \"In moments like that, you have to look past whatever the commercial losses are and be guided, again, by the simple rule that there's nothing more important than the quality and integrity of your people and your product.\"\n\n\"Everything depends on upholding that principle,\" he added.\n\nAfter \"Roseanne\" was canceled, ABC announced a spinoff, \"The Conners,\" in which Barr's character was killed off the series.\n\nDespite not being the rating's powerhouse that the \"Roseanne\" revival was, \"The Conners\" is still very popular for ABC, averaging about 7 million viewers per week.
