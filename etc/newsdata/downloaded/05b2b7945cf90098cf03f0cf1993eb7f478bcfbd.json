He knew the bear\u2019s patterns, knew it would be here at this creek soon enough, and here it was. He raised the .338 he\u2019d borrowed from a friend to his cheek, his heart pounding hard enough to jostle the barrel. He squeezed the trigger, and the bear lay down as if sleeping. One shot, done. He\u2019d brought it down, all 350 pounds of it, all by himself.\n\nKaleb McGary hunts bears alone in remote Washington state. So, yeah, an onrushing defensive tackle isn\u2019t exactly the most intimidating sight he\u2019s ever faced.\n\nKaleb McGary. (Illustration by Amber Matsumoto)\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMcGary, a first-round pick of the Atlanta Falcons earlier this year, describes his tumultuous life as a country song, and it\u2019s added a couple new verses since he arrived in Atlanta. There is the injury Sunday night against Philly that left his knee sounding like breakfast cereal, and of course the heart surgery this past summer. No big deal.\n\n\u201cJust a bump in the road,\u201d McGary says, smiling.\n\nThe hulking offensive tackle has the potential to be one of the league\u2019s stalwarts. If he does, it\u2019d still be only about the fourth or fifth most interesting thing about him.\n\nJust a good ol\u2019 boy\n\nMcGary, 6-foot-8 and 300-plus pounds, looks and sounds like an enormous version of Parks and Recreation-era Chris Pratt, a country-boy aw-shucks attitude concealing a guy who\u2019s watching everything around him \u2014 including you \u2014 very closely. He walks through the Falcons locker room wearing a cowboy hat and boots with shorts, sporting a sleeveless \u2018MERICA F**K YEAH T-shirt (with the lower 48 in place of the **, of course). It\u2019s not an affectation. He\u2019s been this way since high school.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo McGary, the advantages of growing up in rural Washington \u2014 a town called Amboy, located in the southwest corner of the state, population 1,600 \u2014 were as immense as the Cascades. \u201cI got to go hunt and fish when I wanted. Deer, elk, bear would walk through our yard. It\u2019s the best kind of place I could\u2019ve possibly grown up.\u201d Then he gets poetic: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than the smell of the pines on a frosty spring morning with everything in bloom. That can\u2019t be beat.\u201d\n\nMcGary spent countless hours fishing, hunting, driving through the mountains with friends, chopping wood in the summer to store for the winter. That kind of life \u2014 \u201cparadise,\u201d McGary calls it \u2014 gets into your soul.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free. Here\u2019s how.]\n\nSo when McGary\u2019s father Justin contracted multiple sclerosis, leading to the loss of his job and the family\u2019s Amboy farm, Kaleb tried his best to bring the serenity of the wilderness along with him when the family was forced to move north to the (relatively) big city of Fife.\n\n\u201cHe was a through-and-through country boy,\u201d says Kent Nevin, then and now the football coach at Fife High School in Fife, located near Tacoma. \u201cHe wore a cowboy hat around school. He sang country music, he took great pride in this white junker truck he drove around. It was all in being who he was.\u201d\n\nMcGary had to hold onto whatever he could of his life in Amboy, because in Fife, the family had almost nothing. They\u2019d planned to move in with Kaleb\u2019s grandparents. But their home was so stuffed with hoarded treasures of a half-century, there was no room for the McGarys. Instead, they lived in RVs on the property, parents in one, kids in the other.\n\nNevin still recalls the day he met the enormous transfer student that was coming to wreck the opposition. \u201cThe first thing out of his mouth was, \u2018Coach, my name\u2019s Kaleb McGary. I\u2019m really looking forward to playing with you.\u2019 And then he shook my hand. You don\u2019t see many 16-year-olds with that kind of maturity.\u201d\n\nThat presence extended onto the field, too. On more than one occasion, McGary \u2014 already towering over everyone around him \u2014 would walk over to a referee, put a catcher\u2019s mitt-sized hand on the smaller man\u2019s shoulder, shake his head sadly, and say, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that was the right call, sir.\u201d\n\nMcGary had uncommonly agile feet for someone his size, and hands that could practically slap a salmon out of a river. He lined up at tight end in high school, and all his quarterbacks had to do was loft the ball in his general direction. He\u2019d been through hell the last few years, but at Fife, everything seemed to be stabilizing.\n\nAnd then his heart started fluttering.\n\nKaleb McGary at Washington, wrecking fools. (Getty)\n\nLife-changing moment\n\nIn the fourth quarter of a January 2013 basketball game, McGary lost consciousness, toppling face-first onto a row of wooden bleachers in Fife\u2019s gym. While en route to the emergency room in Tacoma, McGary\u2019s heart was beating 300 times a minute. Cardiologists recommended immediate surgery to replace a valve, and hinted that McGary\u2019s days of playing football were over.\n\nMcGary was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, a condition where the heart muscles flutter at random, unpredictable intervals. He underwent three cardiac ablation procedures \u2014 an operation that involves burning a small area of the heart to calm the irregular beats.\n\nOne night in the midst of all the woes, Nevin and McGary talked. And the perspective McGary brought to his own life once again surprised Nevin.\n\n\u201cI can sit here and have a pity party,\u201d he said, \u201cor I can turn and fight. I can control what I can control. I can\u2019t control these other things. If I take care of my business, things will work out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was pretty big for a young man,\u201d Nevin said. \u201cHe got that he couldn\u2019t wallow and have self-pity. He could have gotten sidetracked. He didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe cardiac ablation treatments were enough to get him prepared and ready for duty at the nearby University of Washington in Seattle \u2014 a transition he made with characteristic country-boy insight.\n\n\u201cThe traffic. My lord, the traffic,\u201d McGary says. \u201cAnd I was outraged that I had to pay to park. To spend money, I had to pay money.\u201d\n\nWhile at Washington, he beefed up and leveled up. He started 47 of his 53 games, and along the way, a realization began to dawn in his mind.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even give any thought to the NFL until my junior year,\u201d he says. \u201cIt sounds kind of silly, but I hadn\u2019t even thought about it. But I\u2019d watch games of my opponents, and they\u2019d be playing SEC and ACC teams. I\u2019d see their tackles, who were really highly ranked, and I started thinking, I do my job as good as [ACC and SEC linemen] against some of the same people.\u201d\n\nHe won the Morris Trophy, the Pac-12\u2019s peer-voted award for linemen, his senior year. He was selected in the first round \u2014 31st overall \u2014 by the Falcons as part of their O-line overhaul. He struck a deal with Atlanta: four years, $10.3 million, with a $5.5 million signing bonus and $8.7 million guaranteed. That was enough to put his parents into a new house this summer\u2014good thing, too, since in yet another verse of the country song that is McGary\u2019s life, the family home had nearly burned to the ground.\n\nAnd then his heart started acting up again.\n\nMcGary protecting Matt Ryan. (Getty)\n\nDelayed start in the NFL\n\nThe treatment for this latest flare-up: another ablation, and several weeks on the shelf during the most important days of his career.\n\n\u201cI was bummed, very bummed,\u201d McGary says, recalling when he got the news that all was not well with his heart. \u201cBut [the procedure] was what all the specialists, all the experts said was the best course of action, so I trusted their judgment. It was not something that I wanted to go through again, but worse things could have happened. It\u2019s just a bump in the road.\u201d\n\nBy late August, McGary made his way back onto the field, and even though he was weeks behind his teammates, still played his way into the starting lineup of his first game. He gave up a sack, but won praise from his teammates.\n\n\u201cFortunately, but unfortunately, as an offensive lineman, there\u2019s no mystery if you messed up,\u201d McGary says. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to tell the truth: you messed up this play, fix the problem, don\u2019t do it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a nice job,\u201d Matt Ryan said after the Vikings loss. \u201cHe\u2019s worked his way back into condition. He\u2019s played tough for us.\u201d\n\nSunday night added another chapter to the McGary saga, when an Eagles pass rush threw Ryan into McGary\u2019s left knee, which buckled. McGary had to be helped off the field, and athletic trainers loaded him onto a cart that wheeled him into the depths of Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Combined with the injury to fellow first-rounder Chris Lindstrom, who broke his foot in the season opener, it seemed a case of the same old snakebitten McGary, just a different team.\n\nBut McGary wasn\u2019t done, not for the season, not for the night. He passed athletic trainers\u2019 tests, he put more weight on the leg, he returned to the sideline to start the second half, and he returned to the game in the fourth quarter. Atlanta won the game, and McGary won the respect of his new team.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw Kaleb in the locker room at halftime, he looked better than I thought he would,\u201d Falcons offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter said after the Eagles game. \u201cHe was saying he was going to try to come back in. Obviously, that\u2019s a trainer and doctor decision, but the fact that he wanted to get back in there and try, that says a lot about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat snap, crackle, pop [feeling] is never a good thing,\u201d McGary said after the game. \u201cIf I sat out the rest of the game ... that\u2019s admitting defeat and I was letting my teammates down. I never want to let my brothers down.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons live and die by their pass protection; if Matt Ryan has time in the pocket, he\u2019s one of the most dangerous quarterbacks in the league. This season, the Falcons face four of the top six pass rush units, per PFF, this year \u2014 though they\u2019ve already knocked out the No. 1-ranked Eagles. Much of the burden for keeping Ryan clean will fall on McGary, and he\u2019s ready to meet that challenge.\n\n\u201cI have goals,\u201d he says, \u201cbut all of them amount to just contributing. If I can help this team any way I can. If they ask me to jump, I\u2019ll ask how high.\u201d\n\nOh, and there\u2019s just one more goal: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever happen again,\u201d McGary says, \u201cbut one day I hope to score a touchdown one more time, relive the good old days when I was 50 pounds lighter and much faster.\u201d\n\nCome on, Falcons. Hook McGary up with a designed TD play. He\u2019s earned it.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n____\n\nJay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
