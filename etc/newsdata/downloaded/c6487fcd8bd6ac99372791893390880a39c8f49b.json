We found some lovely contemporary and graphic mats that bring bags of character and a cheery flash of colour to the front door.\n\nBut of course you may shy away from the quirky and prefer a stylishly understated piece to complement your elegant abode. Whichever style you choose, look for a non-slip vinyl backing to keep your doormat firmly in place.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Made from 100 per cent coir with a non-slip PVC backing, it\u2019s as practical as it is pretty. Hardwearing but strictly for indoor use, this is one contemporary doormat to take pride in.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nMaison de Campagne doormat: \u00a324, Dibor\n\nDimensions: 40.5 cm x 101cm\n\nIts typographic message translates as \u201chouse in the country\u201d but we think city-dwellers can get away with this on their doorstep, if taken with a pinch of irony. It\u2019s an arresting piece, not least because of its unusually wide and slim rectangular shaping \u2013 ideal if you have a grand double door to dress. Made from coconut coir with an all-weather rubber backing, it\u2019s hardy \u2013 but classy.\n\nBuy now\n\nPaper High multicoloured jute and cotton oval rug: \u00a341.95, Not On The Highstreet\n\nDimensions: (approx) 29cm x 49cm\n\nThis striking indoor mat scores high on sustainability. Crafted from durable jute with plaited cotton rags rescued from the garment factory floor, it not only looks boho-beautiful but, like all the best homewares, it boasts an interesting back story. Used as a small rug, or decorative doormat, each one is unique. We loved ours at the foot of our French window bay.\n\nBuy now\n\nSource leopard print doormat: \u00a320, Source\n\nDimensions: 40cm x 60cm\n\nWe loved this fashion forward doormat underfoot \u2013 proof, if it were needed, that leopard print is everywhere (and we\u2019re all for humble doormats getting in on the act). It\u2019s crafted from coconut coir with a non-slip PVC backing and is suited to both indoor and shaded outdoor use. A striking doormat in a simple design that adds a much-needed touch of glamour to the dreariest of days. Take a walk on the wild side!\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nScion Living Mr Fox navy doormat: \u00a349.95, Turtle Mat\n\nDimensions: 60cm x 85cm\n\nUrban fox fans will appreciate a welcome home from this friendly fellow of their doorstep. It is carpet soft, making it an ideal mat for indoors. Part of Scion Living\u2019s extensive (and highly covetable) range of graphic homewares, we loved its simple, contemporary design and bold colourway. It can be machine washed and tumble dried to maintain its newness and is backed with a non-slip material, making it a highly durable piece.\n\nBuy now\n\n\n\nDunelm silly sausage doormat: \u00a35, Dunelm\n\nDimensions: 40cm x 60cm\n\nWe couldn\u2019t help but smile at Dunelm\u2019s doormat offering. This coir mat with a non-slip vinyl backing was incredible value for money yet it proved every bit as popular with our house guests as our pricier pieces. And who doesn\u2019t love a cheeky sausage dog to welcome them home, or see them off to work? Graphic, contemporary, and undoubtedly one for dog lovers.\n\nBuy now\n\nBombay Duck rainy day umbrella doormat: \u00a319.50, Bombay Duck\n\nDimensions: 45cm x 75cm\n\nThis quirky graphic doormat comes with a guarantee that you\u2019ll never leave the house without your brolly again. Another coconut coir number, only this time in stand-out cream with an endearing blue and red design, we found it made a cheery addition to the hallway, whatever the weather. And despite the raindrops, this one\u2019s for indoor use.\n\nBuy now\n\n\n\nGetting Personal personalised outdoor Nordic cabin doormat: \u00a326.99, Getting Personal\n\nDimensions: 51cm x 75cm\n\nA personalised doormat, whether \u201cMr & Mrs Smith\u201d, \u201cFamily Jones\u201d, or something a little more irreverent, speaks volumes to visitors about our attention to detail. Getting Personal\u2019s customisable doormats are bursting with personality and err on the side of the sophisticated (we\u2019ve seen some cheesy offerings). Our Nordic cabin scene came with a resilient recycled tyre backing and is suited to all weathers. You can preview your wording before you buy too.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nThe Farthing shoe scraper doormat with coir bristles: \u00a319.50, The Farthing\n\nDimensions: 45cm x 75cm\n\nPrimarily a functional doormat with its mud scraping capability, we were rather taken with this one\u2019s chevron striped form, too. Marrying a wire scraper with a traditional coconut coir mat, it offers the best of both worlds and proved to be invaluable in getting the mud off our wellies. This is an affordable doormat, given both its functionality and natural rustic charm.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nGarden Trading star bunting double door mat: \u00a330, Not On The High Street\n\nDimensions: 55cm x 125cm\n\nFor double doors that lead directly to the garden, you need an elongated doormat to catch the incoming dirt. At 125cm wide, this mat\u2019s got you (and your polished floor) covered. We loved this natural coir doormat for its hint of Christmas. With its striking star bunting design it\u2019s certainly seasonal \u2013 but it wouldn\u2019t look out of place year-round. Classic and contemporary.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Doormats\n\nRed Candy\u2019s rainbow doormat won us over for its simple design and cheery flash of colour against the natural coconut coir while Paper High\u2019s multicoloured jute and cotton oval rug is a delightful doormat with a conscience. We were also impressed with Dunelm\u2019s silly sausage doormat for its chic and contemporary design \u2013 serious bang for your buck.\n\n\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
