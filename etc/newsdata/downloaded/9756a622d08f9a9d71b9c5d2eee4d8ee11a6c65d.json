Photo: Getty Images\n\nGeorge Harrison\u2019s estate does not approve of Trump\u2019s message. Ivanka Trump took the stage at the Republican National Convention to the tune of the Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road classic, \u201cHere Comes the Sun,\u201d which was penned by Harrison. Harrison\u2019s estate then tweeted that the use of the music was \u201cunauthorized,\u201d \u201coffensive,\u201d and against their wishes. Then, they added, \u201cIf it had been Beware of Darkness, then we MAY have approved it! #TrumpYourself.\u201d\n\nThe unauthorized use of #HereComestheSun at the #RNCinCLE is offensive & against the wishes of the George Harrison estate. \u2014 George Harrison (@GeorgeHarrison) July 22, 2016\n\nIf it had been Beware of Darkness, then we MAY have approved it! #TrumpYourself \u2014 George Harrison (@GeorgeHarrison) July 22, 2016\n\nHarrison\u2019s estate joins a growing chorus of musicians, including R.E.M., Adele, Queen, Neil Young, and Aerosmith\u2019s Steven Tyler, who want Trump to stop using their music. But you know the Orange One doesn\u2019t care! He ended his speech last night at the RNC with the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want\u201d \u2014 an ironic choice he delighted in using on the campaign trail \u2014 despite the fact that the band has already asked him to stop using the tune. This doesn\u2019t leave a lot of music for Trump\u2019s hip-dad playlist. Well, there\u2019s always Kid Rock. He\u2019s cool, right?", "description": "The problem?
