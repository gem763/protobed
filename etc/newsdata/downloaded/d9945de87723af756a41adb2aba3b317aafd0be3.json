The White House weighed in, calling for thorough investigations.\n\nThere is no indication Klopfer told others about his grim collection, including his wife. Investigators and others have been scrutinizing his past for clues and have been left to speculate.\n\nWas it a hoarding disorder? Was he was trying to save disposal costs as he racked up legal bills suing and being sued by abortion opponents? Was he hoping to torment his enemies from beyond the grave?\n\nSome who knew him recall the German-born Klopfer as a lonely, enigmatic figure. Unprompted, he would often tell how he took shelter as a 4-year-old when Allied planes bombed his hometown of Dresden during World War II. He would describe emerging three days later with buildings smoldering around him, bodies in the rubble.\n\nWhen anti-abortion physician Geoffrey Cly met Klopfer in 2008 to discuss concerns that Klopfer\u2019s procedures were endangering patients\u2019 health, Klopfer immediately brought up the 1945 raids on Dresden, in which some 25,000 people died.\n\n\u201cHow is the suffering from the bombing by the Americans in Dresden any different than the suffering of women by unwanted babies?\u201d Cly recalled Klopfer saying.\n\nCly added: \u201cI thought his abortions, how he kept the fetuses, might be unconscious revenge for the bombings.\u201d\n\nNews reports about Klopfer going back decades portray him as a combative figure, quick to give the finger to protesters. He spoke emphatically about ensuring women had access to abortion in Indiana, which has some of the nation\u2019s toughest restrictions on the procedure.\n\nHe once told a reporter about the abortion debate: \u201cIf men got pregnant and women didn\u2019t, this wouldn\u2019t be a discussion.\u201d\n\nFor long stretches, Klopfer was the only abortion doctor in the Indiana cities where he had clinics.\n\nKlopfer began performing abortions months after the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion. He was doing 3,500 annually by 1993, he told the Chicago Tribune that year.\n\nOther abortion doctors kept low profiles. Not Klopfer.\n\nDuring protests at his clinics in 1993, police admonished him for shoving protesters. News reports at the time said officers rejected his suggestion they pour acid in protesters\u2019 eyes.\n\nHe was constantly embattled.\n\nAllen County Right to Life went so far as to move its headquarters next door to Klopfer\u2019s clinic in Fort Wayne to turn up the pressure on him.\n\nProtesters once hacked holes in the roof of the South Bend clinic and poked a water hose through a mail slot, flooding an entry room. They sometimes convened outside Klopfer\u2019s home in Crete, a mile from the Indiana line.\n\nOne night in 1995, someone shot at his car in Indiana as he drove home, he told police. An armed guard started accompanying him to and from his clinics.\n\n\u201cAm I concerned? Yes. Am I going to change? No,\u201d Klopfer told The Associated Press.\n\nHe was in continuous legal battles, sometimes with the backing of abortion rights advocates, including the ACLU. He joined a 1999 lawsuit that argued Indiana\u2019s ban on Medicaid funding for abortions discriminated against the poor. It also hurt Klopfer\u2019s business.\n\nIt was a 1978 Chicago Sun-Times story that first raised questions publicly about Klopfer, recounting the competition between him and another doctor. A nurse told the newspaper that the other doctor tallied each abortion in pencil on his pant leg. If Klopfer saw lots of marks, he would go \u201clike wildfire to catch up,\u201d she said.\n\nKlopfer\u2019s career started unraveling in the 2000s with a flurry of complaints, including that he performed an abortion on a 10-year-old raped by her uncle and did not notify law enforcement.\n\nCly testified in front of Indiana lawmakers that he treated a patient who had a life-threatening uterine infection after Klopfer left parts of a fetus in her womb.\n\nKlopfer complained that conservative state officials were in cahoots with anti-abortion groups to close him down. But citing shoddy record-keeping and substandard patient monitoring, Indiana regulators took away his license in 2016.\n\nAfter his Fort Wayne clinic was closed in 2013 as regulators\u2019 scrutiny intensified, Klopfer kept making the three-hour drive from Illinois each week until shortly before his death, sleeping overnight in its empty, disheveled offices, said Mark Archer, an anti-abortion filmmaker who met Klopfer at the shuttered clinic last year.\n\n\u201cHe believed he would one day resume his practice,\u201d Archer said.\n\nKlopfer had been displaying signs of being a hoarder for years by then.\n\nKevin Bolger, his widow\u2019s lawyer, went to the Klopfer home after the discovery of the fetuses and said it was impossible to enter some rooms because Klopfer had packed them wall to wall with newspapers, old TVs and other appliances. But Bolger wasn\u2019t convinced hoarding accounted for the collection of fetal remains.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a hoarder collects body parts?\u201d he said.\n\nMost of the remains were from abortions Klopfer did in the early 2000s. They were in airtight plastic bags, inside scores of cardboard boxes.\n\nAt the time he was practicing, in Indiana, as in most states still, clinics routinely sent fetal remains to processors that incinerated them along with medical waste.\n\nWhether he committed a crime in keeping the remains is unclear.\n\nA 2016 Indiana law requires that fetuses be treated as human remains and buried or cremated. It also prohibits the transfer of fetuses across state lines. But the law wasn\u2019t in effect yet when Klopfer practiced.\n\nSome anti-abortion groups in recent weeks likened Klopfer to Kermit Gosnell, an abortion doctor who stored fetal remains in bags, milk jugs and orange juice cartons at a Philadelphia clinic prosecutors called \u201ca house of horrors.\u201d\n\nKlopfer seemed more meticulous in how he stored remains. And he was never accused of performing the illegal late-term abortions Gosnell sought to conceal. Gosnell was convicted of murder and sent to prison in 2013 for the deaths of three babies who had been born alive. Some had their spines cut with scissors.\n\nIn 1982, employees at a storage center in Los Angeles found over 15,000 fetal remains in a container linked to a pathologist. Authorities concluded he kept them to avoid having to pay a medical waste company to dispose of them. Investigators haven\u2019t said if Klopfer may have had a financial motive.\n\nKlopfer\u2019s wife is as dumbfounded as anyone about why her husband did what he did and is still getting over the shock, said Bolger, her lawyer. He said he doubts there will ever be a definitive answer: \u201cHe took the answer to his grave.\u201d\n\nCly speculated that keeping the fetal remains and knowing they would be discovered after his death might have been Klopfer\u2019s way of irritating his critics one last time.\n\nHis foes may get the last word. The fetuses from the garage have been returned to Indiana, where state officials promised they will receive what anti-abortion groups said they deserved all along: a proper burial. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend said it will make its cemeteries available.\n\n___\n\nAP news researcher Jennifer Farrar contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dr. Ulrich Klopfer competed so avidly in the 1970s to perform the most abortions each day at a Chicago clinic that it was said he would set his coffee aside, jump to his feet in the break room and rush to the operating table whenever his chief rival in the macabre derby walked by.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Tarm"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/25/fetal_remains_doctor_96138_c0-125-3000-1875_s1200x700.jpg?5df86175492ddcdc04d9d2b6261257b2d49617ee", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
