In 1995, when England last played New Zealand in a World Cup semi-final, a big man of Polynesian extraction proved the game\u2019s dominant figure, scoring four unforgettable tries. Outperforming the late, great Jonah Lomu would be impossible but Manu Tuilagi is preparing to play the game of his life at the All Blacks\u2019 expense on Saturday.\n\nTuilagi was four years old and still living in his native Samoa when Lomu was tearing it up in Cape Town but, growing up, England\u2019s nemesis quickly became his rugby hero. Now, having starred in England\u2019s spectacular 2012 Test win over New Zealand at Twickenham he is primed to do something similar again. \u201cThis is do or die,\u201d he murmured on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the biggest game of our lives.\u201d\n\nThe 28-year-old\u2019s playing weight is 1st 3lb (8kg) less than Lomu\u2019s during his unstoppable heyday but New Zealand would be unwise to take him lightly. While it is almost seven years since the Leicester centre ripped open the All Black defence to help inspire a 38\u201121 win for his adopted country, neither side have forgotten the impact he can have on games.\n\nManu Tuilagi uses new mindset to savour England\u2019s World Cup moments | Robert Kitson Read more\n\nFor England to curtail New Zealand\u2019s hopes of winning a third consecutive World Cup, they will certainly need a fully firing Tuilagi. Unless the All Blacks can be rocked back and challenged physically only one outcome will be likely.\n\nNo England player packs more of an attacking punch than Tuilagi when he is fit and on the front foot. Even as an unused decoy runner he is a very hard man to ignore, and New Zealand\u2019s midfield will also be bumping into an opponent for whom a World Cup semi-final against the All Blacks feels extra special after years of injury problems.\n\n\u201cYeah, 100%. That\u2019s why, for me, you\u2019ve got to enjoy every second. This is the big moment. Sometimes you forget that with everything that\u2019s going on, but when you really think about it, this is a dream come true.\u201d\n\nTuilagi is equally aware that any past regrets \u2013 and there have been a few \u2013 will melt away if England can squeeze past the 2011 and 2015 champions. Does it feel like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity? \u201cDefinitely, we know that. We know how important the game is but we don\u2019t want to let that overwhelm us and affect us. You\u2019ve just got to get the balance right. Being excited but also clear and controlled.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest England\u2019s head coach Eddie Jones has shown plenty of faith in Tuilagi Photograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhatever the number on his back \u2013 he has worn 12 and 13 during this tournament \u2013 Tuilagi will also be hoping to add to his tally of 16 tries in 38 Tests and repay the faith Eddie Jones has shown in him since he returned to full fitness. Beating New Zealand, though, is never about one superman operating alone: it will require 23 players to be at their best in Yokohama on Saturday.\n\n\u201c2012 was a good day and a good win but it\u2019s not about that day now. It\u2019s about everyone doing his job, not necessarily doing anything amazing. Then the performance will take care of itself. There are going to be mistakes but you just have to move on to your next job.\u201d\n\nGiven his Pacific Islands heritage, Tuilagi is similarly looking forward to facing the All Blacks\u2019 haka, which has always inspired him. \u201cIt\u2019s an honour to stand in front of the haka and accept the challenge. You respect it. We grew up watching it on TV, so to finally stand in front of it is amazing. We always watched the All Blacks in Samoa. We also used to watch the All Black players playing in the Super 12 back in the day. It is exciting now to be playing against them.\u201d\n\nEngland set to restore Ford-and-Farrell axis against New Zealand Read more\n\nLomu is no longer around to grace the occasion but he continues to be an enduring inspiration to Tuilagi. \u201cBig Jonah \u2026 I was a massive fan. It was just the way he played. No one played like him and he remains a big legend of the game. You try [to be like him] but you don\u2019t succeed.\u201d\n\nTuilagi will simply concentrate on getting himself into the right frame of mind for a game that will define the careers of him and his teammates. \u201cWe\u2019re going in against the best in the world. It\u2019s going to be tough but these are the games you want to play.\n\n\u201cThis group of England players is probably the tightest it has ever been. Everyone\u2019s pulling in the same direction. The All Blacks are very physical and we\u2019ve got to match that and try to stop them. If they get on top of you it\u2019s very hard to stop their attack. We\u2019ve got a massive job on that front. We\u2019ll be trying to be ready for anything and I think we are.\u201d", "description": "Manu Tuilagi tells Robert Kitson this England side is \u2018probably the tightest it has ever been\u2019 and he will see it as an honour to face the All Blacks\u2019 haka and accept their challenge", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/779da7a1ca7269f5cba6992878f975f5cde94c9f/190_382_4792_2876/master/4792.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6e9746fd3b39dd8bd125b3a35c87c99b", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
