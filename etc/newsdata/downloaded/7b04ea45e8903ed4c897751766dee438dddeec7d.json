The money will remain in escrow pending the conclusion of the case.\n\nThe decision marks another setback in the case for Bayer after completing its takeover of U.S.-based Monsanto, which originally developed Intacta.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Bayer said it had not been notified of the ruling but added it would comply with all court decisions related to the case.\n\nBayer said it \u201cremains confident\u201d of the validity of its patents and other rights related to the so-called \u201cIntacta RR2 PRO\u201d soy seed technology, noting it would continue to defend its patent rights.\n\nIn July, Brazilian farmers in 10 states outside of Mato Grosso, where the patent dispute originated, were allowed to join the case as plaintiffs.\n\nThe patent lawsuit, initiated in late 2017, centers around farmers\u2019 claim that the Intacta soy seed patent should be cancelled due to a lack of meaningful technological innovation.\n\nRoyalties from Intacta sales in Mato Grosso are estimated around 800 million reais per harvest, according to producers in the state.\n\nWhen royalties from farmers in the other 10 states are accounted for, the amount to be deposited in a judicial account could rise to as much as 2.7 billion reais, the lawyer representing farmers told Reuters in July.\n\nIntacta\u2019s patent protection extends through October 2022.\n\nThe Intacta RR2 PRO soybean seed offers protection against caterpillars and tolerance to the widely used glyphosate\n\nherbicide.", "description": "A Brazilian judge has ordered Germany's Bayer to deposit an additional 286 million reais (56.6 million pounds) in an escrow account due to a patent dispute with local soybean farmers, according to a court decision seen by Reuters.", "authors": ["Ana Mano", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
