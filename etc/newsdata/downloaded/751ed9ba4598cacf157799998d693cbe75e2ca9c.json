We will continue to evaluate and our ultimate decision will be determined by a number of factors, including the Association\u2019s ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations,\u201d Visa said in a statement on Friday.\n\nEBay, Mastercard and Stripe also said Friday that they are withdrawing from Libra, according to multiple reports.\n\nLibra co-creator David Marcus said he remains optimistic despite the latest news.\n\n\u201cI would caution against reading the fate of Libra into this update. Of course, it\u2019s not great news in the short term, but in a way it\u2019s liberating. Stay tuned for more very soon. Change of this magnitude is hard. You know you\u2019re on to something when so much pressure builds up,\u201d Marcus said on Twitter.\n\nI would caution against reading the fate of Libra into this update.

The organization had been planning to launch the cryptocurrency in 2020, though it\u2019s unclear if Facebook is still on track to meet that goal.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on moving forward and continuing to build a strong association of some of the world\u2019s leading enterprises, social impact organizations and other stakeholders to achieve a safe, transparent, and consumer-friendly implementation of a global payment system that breaks down financial barriers for billions of people,\u201d a Libra spokesperson told CNBC.\n\nFacebook has faced ample criticism since Libra was formally announced this year, with two Democratic senators recently urging Libra partners this week to drop out, saying they don\u2019t have confidence that Facebook is up to the task of overseeing the project.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted is skepticism of Libra in July, saying Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency will likely have little dependability.\n\n\u2026.Similarly, Facebook Libra\u2019s \u201cvirtual currency\u201d will have little standing or dependability. If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National\u2026 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2019\n\nThe European Union also began an official investigation into the blockchain-based Libra on concerns over competition.\n\nLibra was comprised of nearly 30 backers and has generated a mountain of publicity as Facebook\u2019s first foray into cryptocurrency.\n\nBut the dominoes started falling last week when PayPal said it was withdrawing from the organization.\n\nFacebook had planned Libra to be used primarily on smartphones, allowing people around the world to transact without having traditional bank accounts.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
