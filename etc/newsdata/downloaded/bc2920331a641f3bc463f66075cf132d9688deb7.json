(AP) - Michaell Chirinos scored in stoppage time and the Vancouver Whitecaps beat the Los Angeles Galaxy 4-3 on Sunday.\n\nHwang In-Beom, on the counterattack, patiently approached goalkeeper Matt Lampson before rolling a pass to Chirinos for an empty-netter in the third minute of injury time.\n\nThe Galaxy (16-14-3), who had their three-game win streak snapped, fell from second to fourth in the Western Conference standings. Los Angeles has a one-point lead, with one regular-season game to play, over Real Salt Lake for the final home match in the knock-out round of the playoffs.\n\nDoneil Henry gave the Whitecaps (8-15-10) a 1-0 lead when he put away a corner kick by Hwang in the 20th minute . Cristian Pav\u00f3n wrapped a left-footed cross around defender Jasser Khmiri to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who bounced a first-timer from near the spot into the net to tie it in the 23rd.\n\nTheo Bair, a 20-year-old homegrown who signed with the Whitecaps on July 17, scored his second MLS goal to give Vancouver a 2-1 lead in the 41st minute. A shot by Chirinos deflected off Bair, who then side-netted a slow roller with the outside of his foot. Los Angeles tied it again when Uriel Antuna scored in the 58th. Jonathan dos Santos lofted a pass from near midfield to Antuna at the top of the box for the finish.\n\nTosaint Ricketts gave the Whitecaps the lead again in the 64th minute. Erik Godoy chipped a first-timer from the right side to the top of the 6-yard box where Ricketts put away a header but Chris Pontius made it 3-all in the 86th.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Michaell Chirinos scored in stoppage time and the Vancouver Whitecaps beat the Los Angeles Galaxy 4-3 on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
