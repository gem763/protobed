USA TODAY\n\nThe specter of the NFL trade deadline looms over this week's fantasy football waiver run. With a couple trades made in the past week \u2014 and others potentially on the way \u2014 it adds yet another variable in the selection process.\n\nRecommended bids based on a free agent acquisition budget (FAAB) of $100 for the season.\n\nBEST BETS\n\nRB Chase Edmonds, Arizona Cardinals ($25). With David Johnson active, but only in an emergency sense, the Cardinals gave Edmonds a full workload in Week 7. He responded with the week\u2019s top fantasy performance at the position \u2014 150 total yards and three touchdowns. If Edmonds is still available in your fantasy league, he's this week\u2019s top waiver pickup because Johnson is still nursing his ankle injury.\n\nTy Johnson attempts to break a tackle against the Patriots.

The Lions put starter Kerryon Johnson on injured reserve with a knee injury, elevating the rookie from Maryland into the lead role. While J.D. McKissic also saw time, he seems best suited for third-down situations. Johnson has averaged just 3.6 yards per carry and doesn't have a touchdown yet this season, but he hasn't had this kind of an opportunity. And the Lions schedule looks favorable through Week 13.\n\nWR DaeSean Hamilton, Denver Broncos ($13). Veteran wideout Emmanuel Sanders being traded to the San Francisco 49ers allows Hamilton to ascend to the role of No. 2 wideout. However, Joe Flacco hasn't been the most productive quarterback in the world (six TDs, five interceptions). And Hamilton hasn't caught more than three passes in a game this season.\n\nWR Zach Pascal, Indianapolis Colts ($11). The surprise performance of the week was Pascal's six catches for 106 yards and a pair of touchdowns. He hasn\u2019t been very consistent, but the upside for Pascal is worth a small wager from your free agent budget.\n\nAlso worth considering: RB Mark Walton, Miami Dolphins; WR Mohamed Sanu, New England Patriots; WR Corey Davis, Tennessee Titans; WR Kenny Stills, Houston Texans.\n\nSIZZLERS AND FIZZLERS: No one can keep up with Marvin Jones\n\nREPLACEMENTS\n\nWR Danny Amendola, Detroit Lions ($8). While Marvin Jones (4 TDs) was lighting up the scoreboard, Amendola quietly saw 11 targets, catching eight for 105 yards. Even the No. 3 wide receiver in Detroit can be fantasy-relevant, especially with Kerryon Johnson out at least eight weeks.\n\nWR Jakobi Meyers, New England Patriots ($7). Any Patriots player is a dice roll from week to week, but Meyers seems to be trending in the right direction. He caught a season-high five passes on Monday night for 47 yards and has been increasingly gaining Tom Brady's trust with each game. However, the Pats' trade for veteran wideout Mohamed Sanu could hurt Meyers' value in the weeks to come.\n\nWR Alex Erickson, Cincinnati Bengals ($6). The Bengals had a pass-heavy approach vs. the Jaguars \u2013 giving Erickson nearly as many targets (14) as he previously had all season (15). He caught eight of them for 137 yards and also had a pair of rushing attempts. Consider him a potential one-week fix with A.J. Green hoping to return after CIncy's Week 9 bye.\n\nWR Bisi Johnson, Minnesota Vikings ($4). Adam Thielen injured his hamstring making a touchdown catch and the Vikings have a quick turnaround this week to play on Thursday. If Thielen isn\u2019t 100%, Johnson could be a short-term fix. He caught four of his eight targets against the Lions for 40 yards and scored a touchdown.\n\nQB Ryan Tannehill, Tennessee Titans ($3). Matt Ryan's ankle injury, plus Lamar Jackson and Dak Prescott on bye this week, could test the depth of some fantasy teams. Tannehill had a solid game vs. the Chargers, completing 23-of-29 passes for 312 yards and two touchdowns. He's the preferred option over Miami's Ryan Tannehill if there's a choice of promoted Week 7 starters (named Ryan).", "description": "Injuries give the Lions' Ty Johnson, Cardinals' Chase Edmonds increased opportunities; Broncos WR DaeSean Hamilton buoyed by Emmanuel Sanders trade.", "authors": ["Steve Gardner", "Published P.M.
