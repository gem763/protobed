It was also granted a licence to show films.\n\nThe licensing panel added a condition that no more than 100 people could be admitted into the museum at any one time, the council spokesperson said.\n\nThe museum\u2019s opening exhibition, entitled Muff Busters: Vagina Myths And How To Fight Them, begins on 16 November.", "description": "Residents in Camden fear display could attract rowdy hen and stag parties", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c2993e83e0e99a56ed3732beed08543bad109eb/187_0_3284_1971/master/3284.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=74a31e3c66cafd4a41f91f53c786cb06", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
