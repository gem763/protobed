Once again, relying on the Drive-By Media for details is gonna be problematic. But we\u2019ll eventually get to the bottom and find out what this is all about. You know, I\u2019m gonna take a flier. I\u2019m gonna take a wild guess. And it might have something to do with somebody inviting the Taliban to Camp David. Whoever did that needs to have their head examined. Now, I can\u2019t believe that Bolton would be the guy responsible for that. Bolton is the guy that has no patience \u2014 well, wrong term. He doesn\u2019t suffer fools, and he\u2019s not somebody that likes to accommodate the enemy. Whoever it was that came up with the idea of having these Taliban monsters up at Camp David, thank goodness that didn\u2019t happen\u2026 CNN is saying that Bolton was fired in part because Trump was upset that John Bolton was upset that the Taliban had been invited to Camp David. It makes perfect sense that Bolton would be upset by that.\n\nEven if you were unfamiliar with the reporting on how the big summit with the Taliban almost happened, logic would guide you to the answer here. Process of elimination: How many doves are there in the ranks of Trump\u2019s natsec bureaucracy, especially the highest ranks that might have influence over how negotiations with the Taliban are conducted?\n\nNot a lot. Even Mike Pompeo, who\u2019s seen as relatively dovish compared to John Bolton, is quite hawkish.\n\nNow, among the very few high-ranking doves in the administration, who might have the audacity \u2014 and ignorance \u2014 to suggest bringing the g-ddamned Taliban to the United States during the week of 9/11 and hosting them at the official presidential retreat? No one, of course. It\u2019s so outrageous and gratuitous that it wouldn\u2019t even occur to a natsec apparatchik. Trump\u2019s advisors doubtless recommended conducting negotiations abroad, as we\u2019ve been doing, and then signing any eventual deal as inconspicuously as possible, knowing how bad it\u2019ll look for the United States once the Taliban consolidates power in Afghanistan again after we\u2019re gone.\n\nThere\u2019s simply no reason to have them here and every reason to keep them far away. Unless you\u2019re a person who so craves the media attention of big unprecedented peacemaker photo ops, and has so little regard for the basic civic sensitivities around an event like 9/11, that you\u2019d be willing to invite them for that reason alone. Is there anyone like that with a high-ranking position in the administration?\n\nI bet Rush has a guess. It\u2019s not John Bolton, he\u2019s certainly right about that.\n\nBy the end, Bolton had reached his limit. \u201cBolton was screaming about the Taliban meeting,\u201d says a national-security expert with close ties to White House officials. Bolton thought a meeting on U.S. soil would legitimize the Taliban and considered it tone deaf to schedule the summit so close to the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The meeting was Trump\u2019s idea, and he bristled that Bolton objected to it internally, this expert and other officials say.\n\nI don\u2019t want to tease him too much here since this is the harshest criticism of Trump (without actually naming Trump) that he\u2019s uncorked in ages. Maybe Rush has reached his limit with gratuitous POTUS drama too; if so, it\u2019ll be fascinating watching him try to criticize the president obliquely enough that his fans can\u2019t accuse him of violating the First Commandment, that Trump Can Do No Wrong. It\u2019s also interesting listening to Rush stick up for Bolton, at least to the extent of crediting him with the basic good sense to oppose the Taliban/Camp David idea. Bolton\u2019s about to become an enemy of the Trump White House, notes Graeme Wood, particularly after he was treated so badly over his final months there:\n\nEarlier this year I wrote a profile of Bolton. In my interviews with him, he sometimes prefaced a statement with \u201cThe president thinks,\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s the president\u2019s view that.\u201d This preamble, I came to understand, most often meant that Bolton was about to say something that he personally thought was nonsense. \u201cIt\u2019s the president\u2019s view that he will meet with anyone, at any time,\u201d Bolton once told me, poker-faced. Indeed, Trump was willing, until the last minute, to meet with the Taliban at Camp David, on the eve of the anniversary of the September 11 attacks. He has met with Kim twice. Trump\u2019s willingness to hold talks may or may not be wise, but there is little doubt that Bolton considers it comically naive. He would prefer that Trump line up the world\u2019s dirtbag dictators and read them a riot act for a new century, with a guarantee of humiliation and ruin for anyone who defies America and its allies. This riot act would not mention luxury condos\u2026 Most Trump appointees have left quietly, and have begun murmuring their discontent only after a decorous interval. Bolton\u2019s dismissal has come after an unusually long prelude of disrespect, both by Trump and by favored allies such as Carlson. And the tweet itself must sting. Obviously it was intended to. Bolton might not observe the same period of silence. In talking to his former associates, I heard many marvel at his energy. He wakes up before dawn to plot against his adversaries. He accepts every invitation to write op-eds and go on television to ridicule those who disagree with him. Trump has, in firing Bolton, made an enemy of a man incapable of rest and letting grudges go. Tomorrow morning he will wake up, as he usually does, and start plotting. It\u2019s 3a.m. Do you know who your ex\u2013national security adviser\u2019s enemies are?\n\nIt\u2019s surreal yet true that negative hyperpartisanship in 2019 now requires the left and right to switch sides in their longstanding estimates of John Bolton, especially if he starts speaking out about Trump. To the left he\u2019ll be the flawed but sharp hawk who at least had the good sense not to \u201cthrow a 9/11 party for the Taliban,\u201d as the \u201cDaily Show\u201d put it in a tweet this afternoon. To the right he\u2019ll be the latest quisling who couldn\u2019t adapt to the new reality in Republican politics and took to throwing tantrums about it. What you\u2019re about to hear may be the last warm-ish words about Bolton on the Rush Limbaugh Show for awhile.", "description": "\"It makes perfect sense that Bolton would be upset by that.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/r.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
