California doesn\u2019t crack the top 10, but Illinois sure does", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s taxing to live in this state.\n\nKiplinger\u2019s\n\nThis week, the personal-finance publication Kiplinger\u2019s released its list of the most \u2014 and least \u2014 tax-friendly states in America. To draw its conclusions, it used a hypothetical couple with two kids and $150,000 in income a year plus $10,000 in dividend income, and then looked at the income-, property- and sales-tax burden that family would face.\n\nIllinois took the No. 1 spot on the list, thanks in large part to its high property taxes. The Land of Lincoln was followed by Connecticut and New York, both of which have pretty high-income taxes.\n\nThe 10 least tax-friendly states:\n\n1. Illinois\n\n2. Connecticut\n\n3. New York\n\n4. Wisconsin\n\n5. New Jersey\n\n6. Nebraska\n\n7. Pennsylvania\n\n8. Ohio\n\n9. Iowa\n\n10. Kansas\n\nMeanwhile, the most tax-friendly states (in order) were Wyoming, Nevada and Tennessee. The first two don\u2019t levy an income tax; Tennessee has an income tax, but it only applies to interest and dividends and not to salaries and other wages.\n\nThe 10 most tax-friendly states:\n\n1. Wyoming\n\n2. Nevada\n\n3. Tennessee\n\n4. Florida\n\n5. Alaska\n\n6. Washington\n\n7. South Dakota\n\n8. North Dakota\n\n9. Arizona\n\n10. New Hampshire\n\nOne surprise? California, widely considered a high-tax state, didn\u2019t crack the top 10 least-friendly tax states. (Of course, it\u2019s important to point out that this Kiplinger\u2019s ranking would look different if the hypothetical family and its income and dividends were different.)\n\nSee: Three cities that \u2018have it all\u2019: Chicago, Porto and Melbourne\n\n\n\nRocky Mengle, the tax editor for Kiplinger\u2019s, told MarketWatch that\u2019s because many people \u201cwhen they talk about California tax, they focus on the 13.3% [income tax] rate, which is the top rate \u2014 but that is for people making more than $1 million.\u201d For many others, the rate is much lower, he said, adding that \u201cCalifornia has a fairly progressive income tax, with nine brackets.\u201d\n\nMengle added that these kinds of analyses are often useful to people looking to relocate, such as in retirement. He said retirees should \u201cpay attention to what type of income they are going to be relying on in their golden years.\u201d That\u2019s because states can tax income, Social Security, money from an IRA or 401(k), rental-property income and other sorts of income differently.\n\nFor example, Social Security income is not taxed in most states, but 13 states do tax it: Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and West Virginia. Even then, they don\u2019t all tax it the same.\n\nRetirees may also want to consider inheritance and estate taxes in the places they might consider moving to. Right now, 13 states and Washington, D.C., have an estate tax, and six have an inheritance tax.
