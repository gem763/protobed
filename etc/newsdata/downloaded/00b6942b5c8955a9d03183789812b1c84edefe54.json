It can happen if you've recently experienced a loss, a major life change, a new baby, relationship issues, or anything else. Of course, it can also simply be something people experience separate from any particular event. There are many different ways that people choose to deal with depression: talking to a therapist, exercising more, leaning on family or friends, or turning to God.\n\n\n\nThe Bible is a source of inspiration for many. It can also be a source for comfort if you're dealing with depression. These Bible verses for depression are a reminder that no matter what, God is there to lift you up. Mental health struggles are a real burden, but they are not a burden you should carry alone.
