Professor Stephen Westaby, 71, said it helped him undertake a pioneering operation that saved a baby girl\u2019s life.\n\nHe developed an appetite for risk following a rugby accident as a medical student that left him with a fractured skull.\n\nProf Westaby told the Cheltenham Literature Festival: \u2018When they shipped me back to medical school they could immediately tell that I was different to the shy and retiring person I\u2019d been before.\n\nProfessor Stephen Westaby, 71, said that having an appetite for risk helped him undertake a pioneering operation that saved a baby girl\u2019s life\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t register fear and that became significant in my medical career.\n\n\u2018I changed and I enjoyed the change. I could cope with anything in terms of the misery you face when you first start in heart surgery. When I first went to the Royal Brompton [in London] in 1974 operating on the children, one in four died.\n\n\u2018I think we are talking about selected tendencies that represent psychopathy.\u2019\n\nThe surgeon, from the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, told the audience how his ability to take calculated risks helped save the life of a baby.\n\nProf Westaby removed a third of five-month-old Kirsty Collier\u2019s heart and replaced an artery in a pioneering double operation.\n\nHe says his outlook of being a shy and retiring person changed after a rugby accident as a medical student that left him with a fractured skull. He is pictured second from left in back row in his rugby team\n\nHe recalled how the procedure went ahead despite colleagues advising him to give up. Prof Westaby said: \u2018I have to say that to do two new operations and film them, you need to be a psychopath.\n\n\u2018You have to be on the edge, but you have to take a chance.\u2019 Miss Collier is now a healthy 21-year-old. Fellow heart surgeon Samer Nashef, who has practised at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, added: \u2018You do need slightly psychopathic [surgeons], who have the ability to deal with the unexpected crisis.\u2019\n\nMr Nashef also revealed how he accidentally set an elderly heart bypass patient on fire on the operating table. Flammable surgical solution got too close to an electric cauterising device and ignited near the groin.\n\nHe said: \u2018The patient did absolutely fine but was rather bemused to find he\u2019d had a full Brazilian.\u2019", "description": "Ruthlessness, emotional detachment and fearlessness are traits more usually associated with psychopaths.
