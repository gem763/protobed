He demonstrated his considerable potential with a well-received speech during the 1976 Republican National Convention.\n\nBut the man could have taught a Brown University master class in self-destruction. He undid himself with his megalomania, bullying management style and alliances with the city\u2019s more sinister forces. When he was forced to resign after his felony conviction in 1984 \u2014 for that assault in his home \u2014 Providence fairly sighed in relief.\n\nBut Cianci lingered in the city\u2019s consciousness for several years as the bilious host of an afternoon radio talk show. Then, in 1990, he stunned everyone by running again for mayor \u2014 and winning. His slogan: \u201c He never stopped caring about Providence .\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that the presumably rehabilitated Cianci improved the look and feel of downtown Providence, and his unwavering support of the local arts scene helped to keep Trinity Rep open. Mr. Brant said that he was initially drawn to the Cianci project \u201cby the idea of doing a profile of someone who once sat in this theater \u2014 who kept the lights on in so many ways.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s also true that Cianci\u2019s perverse understanding of public service led to yet more corruption, culminating in a second criminal conviction, for racketeering, in 2002. He served several years in federal prison, then resumed his role as acid-tongued radio personality, eviscerating anyone who had dared to succeed him.\n\nIn other words: He never stopped.\n\n\u201cThe Prince of Providence\u201d maintains a parochial coziness, reflected in the inside jokes that win knowing laughs: the time that monkeys escaped from the zoo to take their own walking tours of the city (true); the stale Oreos that Cianci lackeys ate while he committed that infamous assault (true); the assortment of Cianci toupees, including an \u201caction rug\u201d for use at crime scenes and in inclement weather (true.)", "description": "A veteran of the newspaper that covered Vincent A. Cianci Jr.\u2019s travails gets all the inside jokes in \u201cThe Prince of Providence,\u201d the hit play about him. So, it seems, does everyone in the audience.", "authors": ["Dan Barry"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/06/arts/06princeprov1/06princeprov1-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
