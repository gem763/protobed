We have been together for a year. While I didn\u2019t masturbate until I was 16 and I watch pornography once every few months, I still have to fantasise about porn scenes to be able to climax when we have sex. It disgusts me, but I don\u2019t know how else to do it. After sex, while we are trying to relax and cuddle, I am left with a lingering feeling of guilt. Help my diseased millennial mind!\n\nTaking a practical approach in order to achieve orgasm during sex with a partner does not constitute a disease \u2013 or even something worthy of guilt. Most people make similar decisions at different times and in different situations. You are lucky to be able to trigger your own orgasm through fantasy \u2013 some people cannot.\n\nThere is no perfect way to make love; when people are invested in trying to please each other and create a relatively brief sexual exchange, they often choose expediency over pleasure. But, if you want to have truly satisfying sex with sustained pleasure, you will both have to fully relax, allocate more uninterrupted time and approach lovemaking without the goal of orgasm for either of you.\n\nYour task should be simply to enjoy; you will have to banish distractions and focus solely on the giving and receiving of pleasure. Even so, you may feel the need to use separate fantasy to climax. This habit can be broken if you take the time to train yourself to be truly in the erotic moment.\n\n\u2022 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.\n\n\u2022 If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don\u2019t send attachments).
