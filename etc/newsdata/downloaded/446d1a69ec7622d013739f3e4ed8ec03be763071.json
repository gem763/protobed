It earlier this year agreed to acquire Alliance Data Systems Corp. \u2019s marketing-services business, Epsilon, for $4.4 billion.\n\nThe ad business is facing a flurry of challenges as clients replace long-term agency contracts with short-term projects, cut agency fees and seek new expertise to help them resonate with ad-averse consumers who are spending more time online. Ad holding companies are also competing with consultancies that are aggressively acquiring ad services capabilities and agencies.\n\n\u201cWe have clearly identified the challenges affecting our industry, and we haven\u2019t lost a second in addressing them,\u201d said Mr. Sadoun.\n\nPublicis had already cut its organic revenue growth target in July. For 2020, the company expects its organic revenue growth to come in between -2% and +1%.\n\n\u2014Olivia Bugault contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com", "description": "The French advertising giant said organic revenue is likely to decline 2.5% this year, lowering its guidance as it reported lower-than-expected results in the third quarter.", "authors": ["Alexandra Bruell", "Alexandra.Bruell Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-115856/social", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
