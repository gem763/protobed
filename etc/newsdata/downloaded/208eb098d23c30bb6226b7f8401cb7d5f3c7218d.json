McCain set sail from Japan for the first time since a deadly crash that left ten US sailors dead.\n\nThe destroyer is having its first sea trials after undergoing repairs, which lasted two years, following a collision with the Liberian-flagged Alnic MC oil tanker off the coast of Singapore.\n\nA hole was torn in the warship beneath the waterline that led to the flooding of crew sleeping areas, machinery and communications rooms, killing ten sailors on August 21, 2017.\n\nAround six weeks after the accident, the McCain was taken to its home port of Yokosuka, Japan, on board a the heavy transport ship to undergo repairs, which cost an estimated $230 million.\n\nThe USS John S. McCain destroyer moored in a dock at the Yokosuka Naval Base in Yokosuka, Japan in June this year\n\nThe damage left to the US Navy guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain after a collision in Singapore waters in 2017\n\nHow the USS John S. McCain tragedy unfolded USS John S. McCain - a US navy warship - was involved in a collision with the Liberian-flagged tanker Alnic MC off the coast of Singapore and Malaysia, east of the Strait of Malacca on August 21, 2017. The collision caused the tanker to rip through the ship's hull, creating a gash that flooded crew berths and machinery and communications rooms. Ten US sailors died in the disaster, including Kenneth Smith, 22, Logan Palmer, 23, John Hoagland III, 20, Dustin Doyon, 26, Jacob Drake, 21, Timothy Eckels Jr, 23, Kevin Bushell, 26, Abraham Lopez, 39, Nathan Findley, 31 and Corey Ingram, 28. Four injured sailors were medically evacuated to a hospital in Singapore with non-life threatening injuries. Immediately after the incident the US Navy reports suggested a fatigued bridge crew, poor communication between crew members and crowded shipping lanes as the most likely cause of the accident.\n\nYesterday the guided-missile vessel left Yokosuka pier about 10.15am, with families of the sailors who worked on the ship watching on.\n\nCommander Ryan T. Easterday, USS John S. McCain's commanding officer told the Portland Press Herald: 'This whole crew is eager to get back to sea, and that's evident in the efforts they've made over the last two years to bring the ship back to fighting shape, and the energy they've put into preparing themselves for the rigors of at-sea operations.\n\n'I'm extremely proud of them as we return the ship to sea, and return to the operational fleet more ready than ever to support security and stability throughout the region.'\n\nAt the time of the accident the US destroyer was on its way to a routine port visit in Singapore after conducting a sensitive freedom of navigation operation by sailing near one of China's man-made islands in the South China Sea.\n\nA multinational search and rescue effort involving Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the US was launched to try and find the missing sailors.\n\nAfter the collision, the McCain sailed under its own power and headed to port at Changi Naval Base in Singapore.\n\nAbraham Lopez, 39, Nathan Findley, 31, Corey George Ingram, 28, Dustin Louis Doyon, 26, Kevin Sayer Bushell, 26, Logan Stephen Palmer, 23, Timothy Thomas Eckels Jr., 23, Kenneth Aaron Smith, 22, Jacob Daniel Drake, 21, and John Henry Hoagland III, 20, all died in the accident.\n\nThe commander of the Navy's Japan-based 7th Fleet Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin was fired not long after the crash, following a series of accidents that same year that raised questions about the fleet's operations.\n\nThe USS John McCain set sail from Yokosuka pier yesterday morning after two years of repairs were finally completed\n\nFamilies of sailors and workers who helped get the destroyer up and running watched on as it set sail ahead of its first sea trials\n\nThe guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain with a hole on its left port side after a collision with oil tanker, outside Changi naval base in Singapore on August 21, 2017\n\nJust two months earlier the USS Fitzgerald smashed into a Filipino cargo ship, drowning seven crew on board.\n\nThe firing of the three-star admiral was a rare dismissal of a high-ranking officer over operational reasons.\n\nThe Alnic MC is an oil and chemical tanker that is 600 feet long and has a gross tonnage of 30,000- more than three times larger than the McCain, which is 505 feet long and only 8,300 tons.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the crash, navy reports suggested a fatigued bridge crew, poor communication between crew members and crowded shipping lanes as the most likely cause of the accident.\n\nAn unnamed navy official told CNN the ship lost steering control shortly before the accident but that 'it was unclear why the crew couldn't use the ship's backup steering systems'.\n\nNow the multi-million dollar repairs have been completed, the McCain will undergo rigorous sea trials.\n\nSea trials are a navy term for at-sea testing of systems, typically lasting about a week and required for every ship returning to sea after extended repairs or maintenance.\n\nThe trials include, 'navigation, damage control, mechanical and electrical systems, combat systems, communications, and propulsion application,' according to a Navy statement issued yesterday.\n\nThe bodies of all ten sailors lost on board the USS John S McCain last week have now been recovered.

McCain was involved in controversy when it was said to have been kept out of the way of President Trump when he visited US and Japanese troops in Yokosuka during a presidential tour of the country in May.\n\nAn alleged White House order saw the navy cover the ship's name with a tarpaulin and sailors wearing uniform with the vessel's logo given the day off so the president would not see references to the late senator.\n\nTrump denied the claims saying he 'was not informed about anything having to do with the ship'.\n\nThe Vietnam war hero's daughter, Meghan McCain, called Trump a 'child' over the claims.\n\nMcCain was held for five-and-a-half years in a North Vietnamese prison and was repeatedly tortured.\n\nThe Arizona senator died last August from brain cancer aged 81. Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush gave the eulogies at his funeral with Bill and Hillary Clinton, Michael Bloomberg, Joe Biden and Mitt Romney all in attendance.", "description": "The destroyer USS John S.
