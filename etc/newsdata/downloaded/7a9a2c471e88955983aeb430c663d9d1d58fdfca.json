Instead, just moments after the convention officially opened, it devolved into internecine warfare.\n\nThough Bernie Sanders is scheduled to speak later in support of Hillary Clinton, after endorsing her earlier this month, there seems to still be some lingering resentment. Even the promise of a speech from Elizabeth Warren, a progressive hero to many of Sanders\u2019s supporters, didn\u2019t seem to be enough to placate Sanders die-hards as the convention kicked off Monday afternoon.\n\nEvery time Hillary Clinton\u2019s name was mentioned at the outset, delegates booed loudly from the floor:\n\nBernie supporters from Michigan boo Hillary as Cummings speak. #DemsInPhilly pic.twitter.com/8V9IiL5PjA \u2014 Emma Loop (@LoopEmma) July 25, 2016\n\nThis thing is off the rails. Every time @HillaryClinton named massive boos cry out. Can't even hear Marcia Fudge in the arena. #DemsInPhilly \u2014 Domenico Montanaro (@DomenicoNPR) July 25, 2016\n\nPattern on the floor: mentions of Hillary draw more cheers than boos, but there are lots of boos, and Bernie fans cheer longer than hers. \u2014 Josh Barro (@jbarro) July 25, 2016\n\nPretty obvious down here on the floor that a significant % of the Bernie delegates are unhappy. And vocal. #DNC2016 \u2014 Scot Lehigh (@GlobeScotLehigh) July 25, 2016\n\nThe \"lock her up\" chant \u2014 a favorite of delegates to the Republican National Convention that was heavily criticized \u2014 has made an appearance at the Democratic convention as well:\n\nBernie delegates from CA chant \"Lock her up\" \u2014 Betsy Woodruff (@woodruffbets) July 25, 2016\n\nSanders himself tried to calm the chaos, asking his supporters to corral the demonstrations and to stop them from unfolding:\n\nAfter rowdy day, Sanders sends text to supporters:\"I ask you as a personal courtesy to me to not engage in any kind of protest on the floor\" \u2014 Nancy Cordes (@nancycordes) July 25, 2016\n\nBut as several observers pointed out, Sanders had encouraged his supporters to believe that he could win the nomination \u2014 and now is struggling to wind them down now that he\u2019s fallen in line behind Clinton:\n\nExtraordinary watching Sanders plead with his supporters to come back down to earth, after months of fueling unlikely victory scenarios. \u2014 Nick Confessore (@nickconfessore) July 25, 2016\n\nIowa delegate @chris_laursen: \"Bernie basically fed us a bunch of Mountain Dew and now he wants us to go to bed. It\u2019s not going to happen.\" \u2014 Jason Noble (@jasonnobleDMR) July 25, 2016\n\nAll in all, between the growing protests outside and the chaos on the convention floor, Philadelphia is offering the spectacle of a divided party that the Republican convention in Cleveland did not. Even when boos broke out during Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s speech to the RNC, they were in favor of the party\u2019s nominee:", "description": "A day supposedly dedicated to party unity is not going so well.", "authors": ["Zeeshan Aleem", "Constance Grady", "Nicole Narea", "Hannah Brown", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l4z6o0mF0gL-k4J-2ttC2JUwlok=/0x258:4960x3048/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/50200419/580949606.0.jpg", "published_at": "2016-07-25"}
