Since he entered the race, Mr. Biden has been dogged by questions about his physical fitness and condition \u2014 concerns he has tried to alleviate by bounding through parade routes and shaking dozens of hands in steamy summer weather. Mr. Sanders keeps a blistering campaign schedule that often includes multiple events in multiple cities each day. And supporters of Ms. Warren gush about her vitality, bragging about the hundreds of selfies she takes with supporters after each appearance.\n\n\u201cI was just amazed that when you first came out here, Senator Warren, that you ran up those steps the way that you did, and all this energy and stamina that you have,\u201d Nikita L. Jackson, a Rock Hill, S.C., city councilwoman , said as she praised Ms. Warren to a crowd at a town hall event on Saturday.\n\nNone of the Democratic candidates have been particularly eager to delve into the details of their health. Aides to Mr. Sanders released a brief statement noting that he \u201cwas found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted,\u201d a fairly common procedure in the United States. Like his rivals, Mr. Sanders has not yet released his medical records, though all three have vowed to do so before the Iowa caucuses in February.\n\nWith little actual medical information, even minor irregularities in how candidates appear have prompted a flurry of age-related speculation. When Mr. Sanders hit his head on the edge of a glass shower door, his campaign explained that he had received a cut requiring stitches but stressed that he did not fall. Mr. Biden appeared to be moving his mouth in a strange fashion during the last debate, which led to questions about whether he wore dentures. At Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign events, voters question whether his verbal missteps can be attributed to his age.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not as sharp as he might be,\u201d said Carol Sobelson, 63, at a campaign event in Concord, N.H. \u201cHe\u2019s done a lot for our country, he was a great vice president. He\u2019s probably not my first choice.\u201d\n\nHealth, or the perception of a candidate\u2019s health, is unlikely to be off the table in a campaign against Mr. Trump. In 2016, his supporters spliced together video footage of Hillary Clinton coughing and Mr. Trump often questioned her stamina, particularly after she abruptly left a ceremony in New York honoring the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. Already, Mr. Trump has started questioning Mr. Biden\u2019s energy levels, nicknaming him \u201cSleepy Joe.\u201d", "description": "The top three Democratic candidates are 78, 76 and 70 years old and one of them, Bernie Sanders, went to the hospital with chest pain. Voters want experienced leaders, but exactly how much life experience do they want?", "authors": ["Lisa Lerer"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/us/politics/02age-01/02age-01-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
