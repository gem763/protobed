She worked as legal counsel at a national nonprofit then, and told no one at the office that she was expecting. Normally thin, she hid her changing figure under baggy clothes and, once she began to show, a tight girdle. She begged her obstetrician to squeeze her in for appointments early in the morning or during her lunch breaks.\n\nGet the Parenting Newsletter Email Sign Up\n\nWhen, by the end of her second trimester, it became clear that she wouldn\u2019t be able to keep her pregnancy a secret much longer, my mom went into her boss\u2019s office and gave notice. Though startled by her abrupt departure, he threw her a goodbye party; according to my mother, the colleagues who attended still had no idea that she was pregnant.\n\nMy mother had a good reason for hiding her news at work: This was in 1968, when it was legal to fire female employees for becoming pregnant. A decade later, Congress passed the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which made it illegal for employers with 15 or more employees to consider pregnancy in personnel decisions, including hiring, firing, pay and benefits. Today, the law offers pregnant women the same protections and accommodations as other temporarily disabled employees.\n\n[If you're pregnant and working, know your rights.]\n\nFew women use girdles to hide their pregnancies anymore, but many still worry about when and how to let their bosses know that they\u2019re expecting. According to the National Partnership for Women & Families, almost 31,000 pregnancy discrimination charges were filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and state-level agencies between October 2010 and September 2015. While almost one-third of the complaints were filed by women alleging they were fired because they were pregnant, other common claims included discriminatory employment conditions and workplace harassment.\n\n\u201cPregnancy discrimination can be as subtle as noticing that you\u2019re not being picked anymore for key assignments, or not being given as much work or responsibility,\u201d said Sarah Fleisch Fink, J.D., general counsel and director of workplace policy for the National Partnership for Women & Families. \u201cThat\u2019s one reason why in many cases it can be so hard to prove.\u201d\n\nBecause pregnancy discrimination is often subtle and hard to prove, how and when you reveal your pregnancy to your employer can matter a great deal. For this guide, I interviewed three lawyers who specialize in employment law, as well as a consultant who assists organizations in developing and implementing family-friendly policies, for advice on how best to break the baby news to your boss.", "description": "Prepare yourself for both positive and negative reactions before sharing your happy news.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/16/multimedia/parenting-parental-leave/parenting-parental-leave-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
