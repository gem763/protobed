We have two kids, in high school and middle school, and school is back in full swing. Samantha has a low-paying, part-time job and is looking for a full-time job and considering graduate school.\n\nSamantha now wants to stay \"until she gets on her own two feet.\" Her parents don't live in the States, but she could easily rent a room with her peers.\n\nIt's been over three months, and I feel that we've been more than gracious hosting her, cooking, taking her on a trip and providing for her needs without expecting anything in return. We are a busy family; the kids have multiple sports and activities during the week, we both work full time, and this is causing tension in the family. Steve and Samantha's dad are really close, and Steve has a hard time saying no. I'm ready to end Samantha's \"summer vacation.\"\n\nIt's not the money or the space. I just don't want to be responsible for a young adult; it opens up a different set of challenges and issues.\n\nHow do I put a deadline on this without being rude and without damaging our marriage?\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/For The Washington Post)\n\n\u2014 Ready\n\nReady: A deadline isn\u2019t rude. It\u2019s your home, so you and your husband theoretically could \u2014 if he agreed to it \u2014 simply say no to her request to extend her stay.\n\nThe nice way to do it is to say something that is both kind and honest and then be direct. Maybe: \u201cWe have really enjoyed getting to know you over these past three months. We just need to get our household back to its routine. We will be happy to help you find another place, though.\u201d\n\nIf Steve\u2019s merely uncomfortable with this, then you volunteer to be the messenger. If Steve is completely opposed to kicking Samantha out, then ask him where he\u2019d draw the line on her stay, if anywhere, then work toward each other from there to a time frame you both can bear.\n\nAs I read your question, though, all I could think was: You both work full time, your kids have multiple sports and activities . . . so why isn\u2019t Samantha driving and cooking and (ugh) grocery shopping for you, as part of the terms of her living in your home? Why are you \u201chosting\u201d and \u201cproviding for [the] needs\u201d of a productive, fully grown person who is no longer a guest but instead someone who considers your household her home?\n\nAn adult \u2014 even a young one \u2014 is not your responsibility, and she doesn\u2019t become that just for living under your roof.\n\nI realize I\u2019m biased. But as someone in your position almost exactly, the idea of a third adult \u2014 family no less! \u2014 to help run the family machinery just sounds like bliss to me.", "description": "The aunt wants to get her house back to the family\u2019s regular routine, but her kin wants to stay longer.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "October At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
