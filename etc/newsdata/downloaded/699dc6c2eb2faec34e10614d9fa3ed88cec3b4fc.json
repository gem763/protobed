Dick Durbin (D., Ill.).\n\nThe message: if Dr. Sharpless didn\u2019t move to ban the flavored products in 10 days, Mr. Durbin would publicly demand his resignation.\n\nThe ban was announced Sept. 11 by President Trump, Dr. Sharpless and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.\n\nClose observers say Mr. Durbin\u2019s persistence on the issue, along with mounting evidence of death and illness associated with vaping, has long been pivotal in advancing safety issues related to tobacco and nicotine.\n\n\u201cThe real hero in this fight is Dick Durbin,\u201d said David Kessler, the former FDA commissioner who served under both Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. \u201cThere has been a fierceness and a persistence about Sen. Durbin and his staff.\u201d\n\nDr. Sharpless, in a written statement, said, \u201cWe appreciate Sen. Durbin\u2019s passion for the agency\u2019s public health mission and we look forward to continuing to work with him to address this growing problem.\u201d\n\nWhile cigarette smoking has declined among teens, nearly 28% of high-school students this year reported using e-cigarettes at least once in the past 30 days, up from 21% last year, according to a recent federal study. On Friday, Mr. Durbin and three colleagues called on the FDA to ban all pod- and cartridge-based e-cigarettes, the type used most by minors\u2014until they can be shown to benefit the public health.\n\nMr. Durbin is among a handful of lawmakers including Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska), Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) and Patty Murray (D., Wash.) who have been urging stringent action on the flavored products for a year or more.\n\nMr. Durbin came away from a heated May conversation with Dr. Sharpless\u2014audible outside the senator\u2019s office\u2014\u201cdisappointed and alarmed\u201d at what he regarded as the agency\u2019s inaction, the senator wrote in a follow-up letter to the commissioner.\n\nMr. Durbin\u2019s aides said they once visited a vape store near his Senate office that sold liquid flavors like gummy bear, whipped cream and tutti-frutti that they believe are targeted toward children.\n\nHe expressed his frustration with the FDA\u2019s acting commissioner by sending him a letter dated May 29 that quoted President Abraham Lincoln \u2019s famous missive to battle-shy Union general George McClellan: \u201cIf you do not want to use the Army, I should like to borrow it for a while.\u201d\n\nMr. Durbin has since praised the administration for its plan to ban flavored electronic cigarettes.\n\nAltria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, invested almost $13 billion in e-cigarette company Juul.

Osipova/The Wall Street Journal\n\nThere are still those, in academia and elsewhere, who contend e-cigarettes can fill a positive role in getting smokers off combustible cigarettes.\n\n\u201cDespite some risks of nicotine dependence that can be mitigated but not eliminated, no credible evidence counters the assertion that noncombustible nicotine products will save lives if they displace smoking,\u201d David B. Abrams of New York University and colleagues wrote in Preventive Medicine last year.\n\nDr. Abrams, while praising Mr. Durbin for his efforts against cigarette smoking, said the senator had nonetheless been \u201cslow to recognize the potential of vaping products for saving lives\u201d of cigarette smokers.\n\nSuch views have largely been drowned out lately amid the hundreds of respiratory illnesses and eight deaths linked to vaping, possibly caused by substances like vitamin E acetate and THC in black-market products.\n\nMr. Durbin, 74 years old, was a high school sophomore when his father, a two-pack-a-day smoker, died of lung cancer. The senator says that, to this day, he still tenses up when he hears someone cough.\n\nSo when he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1982, one of his first efforts was to take on Big Tobacco, despite advice to the contrary from multiple colleagues. Once, waiting for a flight from Phoenix to Chicago, he learned he was assigned a middle seat in a smoking section. He asked an airline worker whether she could do anything about this. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you can.\u201d\n\nHis first successful major legislative foray against the tobacco industry was to get smoking banned on flights of less than two hours\u2014deciding on that limit after a senior colleague told him he could last only two hours without a smoke.\n\nBy 2014, Mr. Durbin along with then- Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D., Calif.), Sens. Blumenthal, Brown and others, commissioned a staff report on e-cigarettes noting that sales of the products were promoted at events \u201cmany of which appear to be youth-oriented.\u201d\n\nHe and colleagues have often continued to be out front of the FDA as it considered more regulation of tobacco and e-cigarettes. For instance, in April 2016, they pressed the Obama administration to finish a so-called deeming rule granting the FDA power over e-cigarettes and other tobacco products.\n\nThat happened soon after. In 2018, the FDA\u2019s then-commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, required e-cigarette manufacturers to submit plans on how they would curb sales to youngsters.\n\nIn the view of Mr. Durbin and Ms. Murkowski, that wasn\u2019t enough. Because of a sharp uptake in youth vaping, the senators called on the agency to outright ban flavors, like blue razz candy and chocolate cupcake, that appealed to children.\n\n\u201cThere are other leaders on this issue,\u201d said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, \u201cbut among active members of Congress, no one has been more consistently involved than Dick Durbin.\u201d\n\nWrite to Thomas M.
