So far, that approach is providing a sliver of light to the moribund economy.\n\nIn recent months, the regime has scaled back its once frenzied printing of money, nearly ended frequent salary hikes, and largely stopped enforcing the price controls that had led to dire food shortages and a thriving black market. Inflation has fallen from a peak 12-month rate of 2.6 million percent in January to 135,000% in August, the National Assembly says.\n\nThe easing of controls is a risky move for a government that has publicly championed its state-led, socialist economic model as the country\u2019s only salvation from greedy capitalists. But the measures are giving some life, even if limited, to the economy Mr. Maduro controls, despite a raft of U.S.-led financial sanctions and dozens of nations deeming his leadership illegitimate.\n\nThe economy is also getting a boost from a key consequence of its miserable state: the massive migration of desperate Venezuelans. The some four million migrants who fled since 2015 are sending about $4 billion annually to relatives they left behind, private economists say, and those remittances are in hard dollars.\n\nA Caracas shop selling imported food products at market prices that are all but impossible for many Venezuelans to pay.\n\nThat inflow, as well as a loosening of regulations on importers and business owners, has largely dollarized an economy that the International Monetary Fund expects to contract by as much as 35% this year.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What do you think of Maduro considering a free-market approach in Venezuela? Join the conversation below.\n\nRetailers now frequently accept greenbacks or sell once-subsidized staples in the local currency, the bolivar, at much higher prices. Here in the capital, where food shortages and blackouts aren\u2019t as critical as in other cities, new stores have popped up selling everything from $15 boxes of Cheerios to $3 bottles of water.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a breath of relief for some producers and vendors,\u201d said Henkel Garcia, director of Econometrica, a Caracas consulting firm. He noted that multiple brands of staples such as sugar, pasta and flour now appear on store shelves, unusual to shoppers wearily accustomed to one brand, if that.\n\nThe new reality is welcome news for Venezuelans with dollars, which had been illegal to trade until this year without special state approval. But the lifting of exchange controls has harshly illuminated the paucity of the national minimum wage, worth less than $2 a month. The vast majority of Venezuelans still depend on nearly worthless bolivars, leaving them to struggle to buy anything amid constant cash shortages and monthly credit-card spending limits under $1.\n\nMany who once proudly policed one of the world\u2019s most closely controlled economies have expressed alarm.\n\n\u201cThis is anarchy in the bad sense of the word,\u201d said Eduardo Sam\u00e1n, a former price-controls czar under Mr. Maduro who oversaw hundreds of inspectors handing out fines to alleged price manipulators at stores and factories. \u201cHere, we\u2019ve gone from being socialist in name only to a savage capitalism in practice. It\u2019s chaos.\u201d\n\nThe Information Ministry didn\u2019t respond to calls seeking comment, nor did the Commerce Ministry, which oversees price regulations. In a televised address earlier this month, Mr. Maduro said controls had to be brought up-to-date.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve gone from being socialist in name only to a savage capitalism in practice,\u2019 says Eduardo Sam\u00e1n, a former economic adviser to the government. \u2018It\u2019s chaos.\u2019\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t update, the people suffer, the revolution suffers,\u201d said Mr. Maduro, who routinely blames Venezuela\u2019s troubles on what he calls an \u201ceconomic war\u201d orchestrated from Washington.\n\nThe easing of state controls is a response to fast-declining output and U.S. financial sanctions that have damaged Caracas\u2019s ability to pay for imports.\n\nLuigi Pisella, who oversees the association of shoe companies here, said his members had grown accustomed to inspectors in red polo shirts and baseball caps arriving to levy fines to keep footwear prices low ahead of the school year.\n\n\u201cNow, there are practically none,\u201d Mr. Pisella said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a total decline in inspections.\u201d\n\nStill, Felipe Capozzola, president of Venezuela\u2019s biggest retail trade group, said there is concern because the government\u2019s \u201claw of fair prices\u201d remains on the books. \u201cThere\u2019s been a relaxing, but the sword is still there hanging over vendors\u2019 heads,\u201d he said.\n\nMaduro allies from the national to the local levels say they are rethinking old economic policies because resolving food shortages, the lack of running water and frequent power outages are higher priorities than fining businesses. Price controls could return, they readily admit.\n\n\u201cI think first we have to get to a level of stability, and then we can agree on prices,\u201d said Willy Casanova, the pro-Maduro mayor of Maracaibo, Venezuela\u2019s second-largest city. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t think it makes much sense to establish control on prices.\u201d\n\nEconomists and others tracking the regime\u2019s new measures describe the changes as a mix of improvised tweaks coupled with hard realities. One former official of the price-controls agency in the western state of Zulia, for instance, said some 300 of his comrades there alone had left the agency, largely because of paltry salaries.\n\nSome of the many imported foods that are newly available in greater numbers in Caracas.\n\nPrice controls on everything from corn flour and car parts to children\u2019s toys had been a pillar of economic policy under Mr. Maduro and his mentor and predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. In 2013, the Maduro administration even created a Christmas jingle portraying the president as a price-slashing St. Nick on a crusade to guarantee affordable holiday gifts.\n\nMr. Sam\u00e1n, a former communist student activist, served Mr. Ch\u00e1vez with gusto and rose to become commerce minister and the nation\u2019s price regulator. In a 2010 State Department cable made public by WikiLeaks, U.S. Embassy officials called one of Mr. Sam\u00e1n\u2019s policy proposals \u201cfar more ideologically extreme than its Cuban counterpart.\u201d\n\nMr. Sam\u00e1n said he wears that assessment as a badge of honor and is proud of his work leading 400 price inspectors who used central-bank data to target business sectors where prices were rising fastest. He said the dramatically higher inflation that hit Venezuela after he was removed from his post in 2014 is a sign his policies had worked.\n\n\u201cWe guaranteed access to products and defended the public\u2019s well-being,\u201d Mr. Sam\u00e1n said. \u201cNow the government is defending absolutely no one.\u201d\n\nEconomists say it wasn\u2019t just price controls that battered Venezuela but also Mr. Maduro\u2019s frequent wage increases. In 2018 alone, he raised the minimum wage by decree six times, including one in which salaries went up 60-fold and the government slashed five zeros off the bolivar.\n\nMr. Maduro paid for such salary increases by simply printing more bolivars. Central-bank data show that the quantity of bolivars in Venezuela\u2019s economy rose by an average rate of 15% a week in the latter half of 2018.\n\nThis year, in contrast, he raised wages only once and the weekly currency-volume increases have fallen to an average of 8%.\n\nSergi Lanau, deputy chief economist for the Institute of International Finance in Washington, warned that the measures undertaken in Venezuela are \u201cnot part of a well-thought-out adjustment program\u201d and that stratospheric inflation could return if the regime abandons its improvised reforms.\n\n\u201cIs this a turning point? I would say no, definitely not,\u201d said Sergi Lanau, deputy chief economist for the Institute of International Finance in Washington, warning that the regime could abandon its improvised reforms. \u201cWho knows in a few months if the decision will be \u2018Well, we need money again. Let\u2019s print some more.\u2019 \u201d\n\nEven Venezuela\u2019s current rate of inflation remains the highest in the world. And the regime hasn\u2019t made life much easier for the majority of Venezuelans who don\u2019t have dollars. Earlier this year, for instance, regulators raised the reserve requirements for banks while restricting credit. That meant banks couldn\u2019t increase $1 spending limits on credit cards, making them virtually unusable.\n\nAmong those exasperated by the difficult realities is photographer Joe Codallo. He recently maxed out all his credit cards to buy a bag of flour, some cheese and a key.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous when you see how the crisis has hit us all,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Kejal Vyas at kejal.vyas@wsj.com", "description": "President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s authoritarian government, long a practitioner of tight state control of the economy, has cautiously begun implementing free-market policies to tame hyperinflation and correct a brutal economic contraction\u2014and it\u2019s showing signs of success.", "authors": ["Kejal Vyas", "Photographs Oscar B.
