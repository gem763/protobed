Democratic leadership is already signaling that move is coming. \u201cThe failure to produce this witness, the failure to produce these documents, we consider yet additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress,\u201d said Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which announced Tuesday that Sondland would soon be served with a subpoena.\n\nRead: How Gordon Sondland Went From Trump Critic to Trump's Ukraine Whisperer\n\nImpeaching Trump for obstruction would echo past impeachment platforms against former presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Such a dynamic adds a new twist to the longstanding legal feud between Trump and House Democrats over testimony and documents, which has thus far been bogged down in litigation that many fear could last beyond Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nThe Impeachment effect\n\nDemocrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry might just help speed up their legal fight for witnesses and documents, too, legal experts said.\n\nRunning an impeachment inquiry gives Democrats a significantly stronger legal argument in these battles because Congress\u2019 impeachment power is explicitly enshrined in the Constitution, legal experts say.\n\n\u201cI think impeachment makes a tremendous difference,\u201d said Charles Tiefer, former solicitor for the House of Representatives. \u201cThe House has now ratcheted up to a much higher level the purpose for which the documents are being sought.\u201d\n\nBut those cases will still have to march through the court system with epic speed to succeed in time to impact their central investigation into Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine. And few are sure the courts will move fast enough to make that happen.\n\nRead: Here's What Congress Can Do When a President Ignores a Subpoena\n\n\u201cIt totally depends on what the courts want to do,\u201d said Frank Bowman, author of \"High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump.\" \u201cThere\u2019s no rule that says, \u2018Oh, well, this is impeachment, so we have to move super fast.\u2019 There\u2019s just no way to know.\u201d\n\nBefore the Ukraine scandal erupted in September, Democrats struggled to convince judges to speed their cases along. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s high-profile endorsement of the impeachment inquiry in late September might help their case, even though it made no technical legal difference, said Tiefer, now a law professor at the University of Baltimore.\n\n\u201cAll these judges will understand from a glance at the front page of their newspaper that the House is moving fast and needs the evidence even faster,\u201d Tiefer said.\n\nDemocrats vowed Tuesday to subpoena Sondland for testimony and documents, saying the State Department was withholding his text messages relevant to Trump\u2019s attempts to push Ukraine to investigate Trump\u2019s 2020 rival Joe Biden.\n\nSondland\u2019s attorneys said he remains willing to speak with Congress, including about his role in exchanging a series of damning text messages that appeared to show high-level diplomats trying to figure out how to get Ukraine to launch investigations.\n\nBut his plan to appear before the House was jammed by the State Department in the middle of the previous night, when a voicemail from the State Department ordered him to stand down.\n\nTrump soon pulled the ultimate responsibility for Sondland\u2019s failure to appear directly onto himself, tweeting: \u201cI would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court.\u201d\n\nMaking the decision all about himself just draws Trump even deeper into Democrats\u2019 sights over obstruction as their impeachment inquiry presses on.\n\nIndeed on Tuesday, House General Counsel Doug Letter told a federal judge that obstruction might be part of any impeachment platform.\n\n\"I can't emphasize enough: It's not just Ukraine,\" Letter said during a hearing over access to documents related to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe. \u201cAnother possible impeachment count is obstruction of Congress.\u201d\n\nCover: Rep.
