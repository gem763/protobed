At the back, goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois continues to endure a torrid time and there are signs the Real faithful are fast turning on him. While Gareth Bale remains, he is also a far from happy member of the camp.\n\nIn midfield, Luka Modric is a willing but ageing force, while Isco\u2019s form has been the subject of much concern in the Madrid press.\n\nDomestically, sitting second just one point off the top may not seem like a disaster for Real, but the feeling is that with Lionel Messi now back from injury, Barcelona look set to gain momentum and start opening the gap.\n\nReal have been scraping and scrambling, rather than playing the kind of free-flowing, free-scoring football their fans would expect.\n\nAll of this has led to talk that Jose Mourinho is being lined up by Real president Florentino Perez for a second spell at the Bernabeu.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the fixture in Turkey on Tuesday night appears to be a potentially integral one to Zidane\u2019s future at Real.\n\nThe Frenchman can at least take some solace from the face that Galatasaray themselves are far from a happy ship at present. They ended a five-match winless run in official games with victory over Sivasspor in the Turkish Super Lig on Friday night, but sit fifth in the table and have scored just nine goals in their eight league games.\n\nThey drew 0-0 at Brugges in their first Champions League game, while suffering a 1-0 defeat at home to PSG in their second outing.\n\nManager Fatih Terim is under pressure in what is his third spell managing the club, while fans have booed the team at home games this season.\n\nWhile the atmosphere on Tuesday night promises to be intense, Real Madrid have at least handled it before, beating Galatasaray 6-1 in a Champions League group encounter in Istanbul back in 2013 when managed by Carlo Ancelotti. Karim Benzema scored twice and Cristiano Ronaldo bagged a hat-trick that night as Real ran riot in the second half.\n\nIt\u2019s very different circumstances for Real in Turkey this time around, but how Zidane would desperately love a similar outcome.", "description": "A trip to \u2018hell\u2019 is probably not high on anyone\u2019s agenda but least of all when you are a beleaguered boss at a football club increasingly shrouded in doom and gloom.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5daddadd2030272f260fe7d4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
