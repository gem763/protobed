The man who took the footage revealed how his friend had just said waves would not be possible 'unless [he] tempted the gods to hit him'\n\nAs the wave falls back down, the man reappears in his red raincoat and following the path of the other people.\n\nInstead of running after his friend, the guy behind the camera can be heard laughing after the terrible timing of his friend Matt's rock-climbing.\n\nReynisfjara Black Column Beach is famous for its black sand and lies next to the village of V\u00edk \u00ed M\u00fdrdal. This distinct coloured sand was formed by heavily eroded volcanic rock which cooled and hardened after making contact with sea water.\n\nThe beach was named as one of the Top 10 non-tropical beaches to visit by National Geographic, in 1991.", "description": "A man said 'waves wouldn't come' unless he 'tempted the gods', moments before waves engulfed him when he climbed across Reynisfjara Black Column Beach, Iceland, on October 7.", "authors": ["Phoebe Eckersley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/20/19549768-0-image-a-13_1570736414358.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
