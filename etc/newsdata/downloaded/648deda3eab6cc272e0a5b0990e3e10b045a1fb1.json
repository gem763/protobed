He was haunted by her death and couldn't live without her. They are together again and that is some comfort.\n\n\"I think I always knew Dyllon would do this because I knew he couldn't bear to be without her, but I hoped he could have held on a bit longer.\n\n\"This world is a darker place without them. Our hearts are broken.\"\n\nQuinn was just 17 when she hanged herself at the end of her street - just yards from her front door on December 9, 2018.\n\nThe following morning the family laid flowers at the tree where Quinn was found and within hours the wasteland area had been turned into a sea of colour with floral tributes from friends and complete strangers.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nSpeaking back in July Tracey said: \"At first all we wanted to do was cut that tree down, burn it, and never set eyes on it again; However the day after she took her own life, myself my husband David and our son Dyllon went to the florist and bought the most beautiful flowers and tied them to the tree.\n\n\"That tree was the last thing to have felt our daughters touch, the last thing that she saw.\n\n\"We didn't want it to be this awful place that we didn't want to look at again.\n\n\"We wanted to reclaim the tree and make it something beautiful. A space that everyone can use that can provide a sanctuary for people.\"\n\nFrom the outpouring of love that followed Quinn's Garden was born - a place of reflection and sanctuary for anybody who needs it.\n\nMum Tracey, 39, said that following his sister's death, Dyllon returned to Manchester bringing with him a branch from the tree as he 'felt some kind of connection to it'.\n\nHe had taken a year out from university and was working in a cocktail bar which he loved at the time of his death.\n\nHe would text his mum and dad, David, daily and they would visit him in Manchester.\n\nAfter their daughter's death Tracey and David set up the charity Quinn's Retreat to help other families who are going through a similar experience get some respite.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nYou can donate to Quinn's Retreat in memory of Dyllon and Quinn here .\n\nDyllon was a leading force in setting up Quinn's Retreat and was a proud trustee.\n\nThey last saw Dyllon two weeks before he died when he came home to Shildon, County Durham for a fundraising event for the charity.\n\n\"We had such a good night,\" said Tracey.\n\n\"He was up on the stage dancing. He was buying everyone Jagerbombs. He even got his gran to have three Jagerbombs!\n\n\u201cHe was on top form, he really was. There were no obvious signs. He was as normal as could be expected, given what he was going through.\"\n\nBut just days later tragedy struck.\n\nTracey said: \"The night before Dyllon died his housemates said they were all dancing around the front room.\n\n\"They went to bed about midnight and Dyllon sent me a text.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n\"He must have seen something on Facebook about Watership Down because he asked me if I could post the book down to him because he wanted to read it again. I didn't see the text because I was asleep and so replied the next morning but he was already dead by then.\n\n\"One of his friends heard what they thought was the tumble dryer door closing at about 1am but now they realise it was the backdoor opening and closing.\n\n\u201cThe next morning his friend came downstairs and noticed Dyllon wasn\u2019t in his bedroom and went outside and found him on the floor.\n\n\"His friend called an ambulance but he had already been dead for some time.\"\n\nTracey and David were both at work when they got the heartbreaking news.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t find out until about 3.30pm. The police in Manchester phoned our local police and they came to our house and one of our neighbours had told them where David worked. They went to his work and told him and then they brought him to where I worked and told me.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n\u201cIt was just...when I saw David come in I just knew. He was so distressed I just knew.\n\n\u201cHe just said \u2018it\u2019s Dyllon\u2019 and we held each other.\n\n\u201cWe need to do something to stop this happening to other families.\"\n\nThe family have faced further heartache because they have been unable to bury Dyllon because of a backlog with post mortem examinations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult knowing he\u2019s in Manchester and we\u2019re here,\" said Tracey.\n\n\"We want to celebrate his life but we can\u2019t plan anything at the moment. Everything\u2019s in limbo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard. It adds to our grief because you want to feel like you\u2019re doing something and we can\u2019t do that. We've been told it could be today and the funeral will hopefully be on November 1.\n\n\u201cQuinn was cremated and Dyllon will also be cremated.\n\n\"We haven\u2019t scattered Quinn\u2019s ashes yet because we haven\u2019t felt ready.\n\n\"We\u2019ll now scatter them together.\n\n\"Dyllon was actually going to scatter Quinn\u2019s ashes across Europe in the summer and myself and Dave were going to meet them in a few places.\"\n\nThe family are planning a Humanist ceremony for Dyllon and are looking at the possibility of renaming the charity to Quinn and Dyllon\u2019s Retreat.\n\nTracey said: \"People have been bringing flowers and candles to Quinn\u2019s Garden for Dyllon. The charity will now be in memory of both of them.\n\n\u201cDyllon was a very unique person. He was a bit of Goth and his funeral will reflect that. He was quite obsessed with death.\n\n\"He had a Pinterest board for his 'living funeral' in his first year at uni.\n\n\"He was going to lay in a coffin on a table and everyone was going to mourn him so he could see what his funeral would be like.\n\n\u201cWhen he was 14 he said to his best friend that if he died before her she had to come to his funeral dressed as the Grim Reaper. He went on and on until she promised him she would, so there will be a Grim Reaper at his funeral.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the way he would have wanted it. We\u2019re going to have some little Pop Art badges made with his face on for people to take home.\"\n\nBrave Dyllon read out a poem he wrote at his sister's funeral and it's understood that this same poem will be read again at his ceremony.\n\nHumanist Susan Walker said: \"When he read it out, so recently, no one could fail to be moved by his pain.\"\n\nReflecting on how they are coping, brave Tracey admits: \"We\u2019re taking every hour as it comes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some brilliant family and friends around us helping us so much to get through it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the dogs so we have to get up every morning and walk them. We go down to Quinn\u2019s Garden and remember both our children.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\u201cDyllon was fiercely intelligent. It was scary how much he knew. He was like an Encyclopedia. He was so kind and worried about everything and everyone.\n\n\u201cWe went to see Dyllon the day after he died. You\u2019re only allowed to go once and you\u2019re only allowed half an hour.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I did was ruffle up his hair because they had brushed it straight back and he always used lots of hair spray to make it all stick up so the first thing I did was ruffle up his hair.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how I remember him.\n\n\u201cThen we chatted with him. His best friend Kate was with us and my dad and his partner Pat was there as well.\n\n\u201cI said to him \u2018I hope you\u2019re together again now...don\u2019t argue with her too much\u2019.\n\n\"The first thing Quinn would have said is \u2018what the hell are you doing here?\u2019. Then she\u2019d be saying \u2018they cried more when I died\u2019. He would be like \u2018no, I was the favourite. They\u2019d definitely be crying more now\u2019.\n\nIf you need to speak to someone, Samaritans are available 24/7 by calling 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org", "description": "Devastated mum Tracey Beadle shared the sad news that son Dyllon, 21, was found dead earlier this month at his home in Manchester - just two months before the anniversary of his younger sister Quinn's suicide", "authors": ["Andy Rudd", "Image", "Mirrorpix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20666267.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_bea1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
