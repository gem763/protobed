We appreciate your patience.\u2019\n\nHe later updated followers to say he has still not had a response or refund for his trip.\n\nThanks everyone for their support in this Uber fiasco. They've still not made an attempt to contact me about it. I'm not chasing them anymore \u2013 they have my phone number already.@Uber_Support @Uber \u2014 Plastician (@Plastician) October 10, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Uber for comment.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
