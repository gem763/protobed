Sometimes they are trafficked to towns miles away from their homes.\n\nThe week of action between October 7 and 13 was the fourth since the unit was launched last year. In the latest crackdown, 652 men and 91 women were arrested, 389 vulnerable adults and 292 children were safeguarded and 49 \u2018deal lines\u2019 were seized.\n\nMore than 3,000 vulnerable people have been rescued across the four weeks, police said.\n\nThe National Crime Agency\u2019s Nikki Holland said: \u2018Criminal networks rely on the flow of money to further their drug trafficking operations and conceal their assets. Over the last year of county lines intensification, we have seized more than a million pounds \u2013 hitting them where it hurts so they don\u2019t benefit from their crimes.\u2019\n\nPolice said dealers were now being told they will be treated as child traffickers, not just drug dealers, as law enforcement increasingly uses modern slavery legislation to prevent young people being exploited.\n\nOfficers seized 169 weapons including 12 firearms, samurai swords, an axe, knives and a crossbow (file image)\n\nIn Hampshire, where 52 people were arrested, police said it was not only \u2018obviously vulnerable\u2019 children who were targeted, but also those from more stable backgrounds.\n\nDet Supt Scott Mackechnie, from Hampshire Constabulary, said: \u2018Youngsters who suddenly have new and unaffordable belongings, go missing a lot, have friendships with older people or have unexplained injuries are all said to be possible victims.\u2019\n\nEarlier this week, a report exposed disturbing gaps in the way county lines gangs and knife criminals are handled by authorities. HM Inspectorate of Probation found some councils\u2019 youth offending teams in England and Wales are \u2018struggling\u2019 to deal with children and young people caught up in drug operations.\n\nIn some cases, hospitals and schools are failing to alert police when they suspect a child is involved.\n\nLucy Dacey, of The Children\u2019s Society, welcomed the crackdown but said more still needs to be done. She said: \u2018We urge the Government to introduce a national strategy, backed by the financial resources needed, to help end the current postcode lottery and ensure more is done to keep children caught up in this horrific crime safe.\u2019", "description": "In a week-long blitz, organised by the National County Lines Coordination Centre, officers seized \u00a3500,000 of drugs, and 169 weapons including 12 firearms, samurai swords, an axe and knives.", "authors": ["Claire Duffin For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/00/19862316-0-image-a-84_1571354672792.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
