Each lands with a dull thud for different reasons, and one shared one -- namely, feeling derivative beyond redemption.\n\nFirst, a disclaimer: Henson's genius notwithstanding, \"The Dark Crystal\" was a visually interesting, technically impressive and dramatically limp movie. If you feel strongly otherwise, it's possible your mileage may vary.\n\nThat said, the idea of revisiting this puppetry-based fantasy world filled with Gelflings, they of the seven clans, and Skeksis, the vulture-like creatures that rule over them, seems inherently flawed, perhaps in part because even though the movie premiered 37 years ago, the series can't help but feel like \"Avatar Lite,\" cross-pollinated with \"The Lord of the Rings.\"\n\nThe new \"Crystal\" focuses on a perilous quest, undertaken by a trio of young Gelflings in an effort to save their world from warnings of \"the darkening.\"\n\nMuch of the series is beautiful to look at conceptually, but there's no getting around the sameness of the character design (Gelflings tend to look alike), the lack of expression in those big, soulless American-doll-style eyes, and the lifeless storytelling, which certainly isn't helped by the generic characters and some of the irritating Jar Jar Binks-type dialogue.\n\nRead More", "description": "Netflix and Amazon both drop major fantasy projects with winged creatures heading into the Labor Day weekend: \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,\" a 10-part prequel to Jim Henson and Frank Oz's 1982 movie; and \"Carnival Row,\" starring Orlando Bloom.
