The scheme \u201ccould have corrupted KPMG to its core,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nMr. Middendorf, 55 years old, said at his sentencing hearing in New York on Wednesday that \u201cnever in my wildest imagination\u201d did he imagine that what he did might be criminal conduct. He said what had already happened to him was enough to deter any auditor in the world from similar conduct, adding he had been arrested at 5:45 a.m., taken to court in leg shackles \u201cand been in this nightmare ever since.\u201d His lawyer told the court the case had ended Mr. Middendorf\u2019s 30-year career at KPMG, tarnished his reputation, damaged his finances and left him unemployable as a certified public accountant.\n\nIn relaying the sentence, U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken said the criminal conduct was serious because it involved the corruption of a regulatory process. \u201cIt did involve cheating by employees\u2026to give their company a leg up,\u201d he said. He added that be believed Mr. Middendorf \u201cknew what he was doing was wrong.\u201d\n\nThe punishments imposed on the firm\u2019s former auditors are unusual in their severity. Mr. Middendorf is the second former KPMG partner or employee sentenced to prison time because of the scheme. Another two have pleaded guilty and await sentencing. One former partner, who denies wrongdoing, is due to go on trial this fall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare for a Big Four audit partner to face any kind of criminal penalty,\u201d said Stephen Sorensen, a Venice, Calif., attorney who specializes in suing accounting firms. \u201cThis is an extreme case: they were trying to defraud a regulator.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What should regulators do to improve the performance of auditors? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe year-and-a-day sentence means Mr. Middendorf is potentially eligible for early release on the grounds of good conduct. \u201cHe was probably fortunate to have received the sentence he did, given the unprecedented conduct he was convicted of and the prosecutors\u2019 recommendation he serve at least 37 months,\u201d said Michael Shaub, accounting professor at Texas A&M University.\n\nMr. Middendorf\u2019s lawyer, prosecutors and accounting-industry observers agree problems at the firm were widespread.\n\nSome said the $50 million penalty KPMG was ordered to pay by the Securities and Exchange Commission, while one of the highest imposed on an audit firm, was too little.\n\nDozens of KPMG auditors saw emails based on stolen data that discussed which audits the firm\u2019s main regulator, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, was likely to analyze as part of its annual inspections, according to testimony at Mr. Middendorf\u2019s trial this year.\n\nMr. Middendorf\u2019s lawyer, Nelson Boxer, told jurors he had \u201ccounted them up\u201447 recipients of these predictions and gossip emails\u2026and no one yells fire.\u201d\n\nIn its settlement with the SEC in June, KPMG admitted that former auditors at the firm improperly accessed regulatory information. It also admitted that dozens of its auditors cheated on internal exams.\n\nThe firm has since added two independent directors to its board, invested in technology designed to improve its audit quality and undertaken a firmwide \u201cculture assessment.\u201d\n\nLynne Doughtie, KPMG\u2019s U.S. chairman and chief executive, said in an interview, \u201cPeople think of culture as soft stuff, but it\u2019s the hard stuff. Our brand is based on trust and this is some of the most important work we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\nShe added that the firm \u201cis stronger as a result of the steps we\u2019ve taken.\u201d\n\nBut KPMG still has a way to go to comply with government-imposed conditions for cleaning up its act. It has missed a 60-day deadline to appoint an independent consultant, imposed as part of the settlement. The consultant will oversee KPMG\u2019s internal investigation into the cheating, as well as reviewing the firm\u2019s quality controls.\n\nKPMG will next year elect a new chief executive and chairman, whose tasks will include signing an SEC-required certificate of compliance with ethics standards for 2020 and 2021. The firm\u2019s current head, Ms. Doughtie, isn\u2019t seeking a second term when her five-year term ends in June. \u201cWe have dealt with significant challenges, learned important lessons and we are well positioned for the future,\u201d Ms. Doughtie said in the interview. \u201cAfter serious reflection I believe it\u2019s the right time to transition.\u201d\n\nThe accounting regulator has expressed concerns about the quality of KPMG\u2019s audits since 2015. The publicly available results haven\u2019t improved since then: in 2017\u2014the most recent data available\u2014half the 52 audits inspected by the PCAOB had serious deficiencies.\n\nThe regulator chooses higher-risk audits for inspection, so the 50% failure rate isn\u2019t representative of the firm\u2019s overall audit work, a KPMG spokesman said. He added that the firm \u201cexpects its PCAOB inspection findings to show improvement for the 2018 inspections year as a result of the changes it has made.\u201d\n\nPrem Sikka, accounting professor at Sheffield University in England, said \u201cpaying fines has become part of the cost of doing business\u201d for the Big Four. He questioned why KPMG wasn\u2019t charged criminally, saying financial sanctions appeared to have no deterrent effect. For example, KPMG in 2005 reached a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department over its alleged involvement in a tax fraud. \u201cThey were fined $456 million\u2014and what did that do?\u201d Mr. Sikka asked.\n\nAn SEC spokesman declined to comment.\n\nThe $50 million SEC fine is 0.5% of KPMG\u2019s $9.5 billion revenue for the year to September 2018, and equates to about $23,000 for each of the approximately 2,200 partners, according to the most recent data available for the U.S. firm. \u201cFifty million dollars is chump change to a Big Four firm,\u201d said Jim Peterson, a lawyer and former partner at accounting firm Arthur Andersen LLP, which collapsed after being criminally convicted in the early 2000s. While scandals can affect a Big Four\u2019s firm\u2019s reputation, he said, their business model is protected by the virtual monopoly they enjoy on audits of big companies.\n\n\u201cThe Big Four own the large-company audit franchise,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. \u201cThey can absorb almost anything thrown at them.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jean Eaglesham at jean.eaglesham@wsj.com", "description": "A former high-ranking partner at KPMG was sentenced to one year and one day in prison for his role in a scheme to steal confidential information to help the accounting firm perform better in its annual inspection by a regulator.", "authors": ["Jean Eaglesham"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106166/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
