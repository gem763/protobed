He thought that there might have been an intruder in the house,' he told CBS DFW at the scene.\n\n'He didn't know who was supposed to be there and so forth. It was a startling situation, it was an accident.'\n\nThe spokesman added: 'We did ask the question: \"Why didn't you call us, the DeSoto Police Department?\" and like most people say is like: \"I just wanted to know what was going on before I wasted a call to 911.\"'\n\nSchulte said the department wanted the incident to serve as a warning to the public.\n\n'If you come home and something doesn't feel right, [it] doesn't bother us at all, go ahead and call 911, so we can come out and check it out,' he said.", "description": "The officer, who has not been named, arrived at his home in DeSoto, Texas, on Saturday evening and feared someone had broken in because the garage door was open.", "authors": ["Megan Sheets For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/16/20249286-0-image-a-48_1572194611307.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
