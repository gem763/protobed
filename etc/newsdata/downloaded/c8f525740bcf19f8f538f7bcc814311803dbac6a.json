For once, I am almost at a loss for words. I am so happy, as the majority of Britain will be.\u2019\n\nAs Walker\u2019s voice trails away, the footage cuts to Hill on the podium, staring up at the sky.\n\nWe wander into the hotel restaurant for lunch. Other things have changed. Hill is a vegetarian now. He has been for almost 20 years. \u2018Everybody has different reasons,\u2019 he says. \u2018I didn\u2019t want to be part of the slaughter any more.\u2019\n\nHe was never a red meat kind of guy anyway. I mention his sensitivity always set him slightly apart from F1\u2019s testosterone-driven culture. \u2018Are you saying I\u2019m not macho?\u2019 he says, breaking into a grin.\n\nThe reminiscences go on a little longer. I reported on F1 for four years in the mid-Nineties, years that started with Hill\u2019s arrival at Williams as Alain Prost\u2019s No2 in 1993. The following season, he showed courage and dignity by helping the team and the sport emerge from the trauma of the death of his new team-mate, Ayrton Senna, at Imola.\n\nHill (left) helped Formula One emerge from the trauma of the death of Ayrton Senna\n\nSometimes, it seemed he was fated never to overcome his great rival, Michael Schumacher, who robbed him of the title in 1994 by ramming him into the wall in the final race of the season in Adelaide. But in 1996, after a tight battle with another team-mate, Jacques Villeneuve, he finally emulated his late father, Graham, who had died in a plane crash when Damon was 15, by winning the title.\n\nThere were fewer barriers between drivers and journalists then and the day after he won the title, a group of us got the same bullet train as Hill from Nagoya to Tokyo and went out with him that evening to watch the Japanese Beatles at the Cavern Club in Roppongi.\n\nLate in the evening, Hill was invited on stage and sang \u2018Love Me Do\u2019 with the band. \u2018The club\u2019s gone now, I think,\u2019 Hill says, smiling again. \u2018It\u2019s a long time ago.\u2019\n\nHill, 59, who helps to front Sky Sports\u2019 F1 coverage, is enjoying being back in the sport.\n\nThere were times when he was racing when he seemed haunted by the demands. He was never much good at being false or ruthless or disloyal, qualities that F1, like many sports, often appears to prize above all others. But now he has made a kind of peace with it and with himself.\n\n\u2018Winning the world title isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all,\u2019 he says. \u2018In fact, it may even be a hindrance to doing other things. You either brandish it or you try to escape it. I tried to escape it, for sure, but the pull is too strong. I never went to races and for years I didn\u2019t even watch them on television. I barely caught a plane anywhere.\n\nHe is enjoying being back in the sport having struggled with the demands when he was a racer\n\n\u2018And then two things happened: Jackie Stewart called me to tell me I had to be president of the British Racing Drivers\u2019 Club and my younger son, Josh, said he wanted to be a racing driver. That was around 2008. Josh stopped about 2013 but I\u2019m still here.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m very aware that I was lucky when I was driving in F1. I was in the right place at the right time at Williams and, when I got the opportunity, I made the best of it. There is a peace that comes with that. You didn\u2019t fumble it. You didn\u2019t miss the opportunity.\n\n\u2018In our lives, that bus goes past and you either get on it or you are left standing at the bus stop. I gave it everything I had and I was very lucky to get a fantastic car. The FW18 in 96 was just a peach of a car. I had some beautiful moments driving that car, which is what it\u2019s all about.\n\n\u2018When you are a racing driver, it\u2019s not just winning the races, being celebrated or being paid a lot of money, it is actually driving the car and the enjoyment that comes from that. When you\u2019ve got a car that is designed by Adrian Newey and is put together by Williams and has Renault engines, you are in racing driver heaven.\u2019\n\nHill stresses that enjoying taking part in Formula 1 races is more important than winning\n\nSuzuka carries another kind of significance for Hill, too. It was where he and Schumacher made their peace.\n\nThey were never friends but for those four years when Hill was at Williams and the great German champion was at Benetton and Ferrari, it seemed as if their fates were interlinked and so Hill was devastated when, at the end of 2013, he heard about the skiing accident from which a gravely injured Schumacher is still fighting to recover.\n\n\u2018I was very upset when I heard the news,\u2019 says Hill, \u2018particularly because he was out with his son, Mick, and that resonated with me. I wanted to have a relationship with my dad when I grew up and it never happened because of a tragedy and now Mick\u2019s experienced that.\n\nNot only that, he was there when it was happening and his dad is still recuperating from it and clearly going through quite a lot of difficulty.\n\nThe news of Michael Schumacher's skiing accident in 2013 was saddening for Hill\n\nSuzuka carries another kind of significance for Hill, too. It was where he and Schumacher made their peace. They were never friends but for those four years when Hill was at Williams and the great German champion was at Benetton and Ferrari, it seemed as if their fates were interlinked.\n\nHill was devastated when, at the end of 2013, he heard about the skiing accident from which Schumacher is still fighting to recover. \u2018I was very upset when I heard the news,\u2019 says Hill. \u2018Particularly because he was out with his son, Mick, and that resonated with me.\n\n\u2018I wanted to have a relationship with my dad when I grew up and it never happened because of a tragedy and now Mick\u2019s experienced that. Not only that, he was there when it was happening and his dad is still recuperating from it and clearly going through quite a lot of difficulty.\n\n\u2018I haven\u2019t been to see him. I haven\u2019t asked. It\u2019s too private. I didn\u2019t know Michael that well. Oddly, when I retired I interviewed him here in Suzuka for a magazine and he was a charming guy. The game was over, I was retiring, he was able to drop his guard and he seemed a guy you\u2019d want to know.\n\n\u2018As a professional, he was a completely different kettle of fish. That po-faced, chin jutting out character was someone who gave nothing away.\n\n\u2018He was very adept at reducing his opponents, even without his driving, so he was formidable in every way. But they all were. Senna wasn\u2019t an easy character to get to know, aloof. This new generation seem much more relaxed and more outgoing.\u2019\n\nAt the head of that generation, of course, is Lewis Hamilton, who is closing in on his sixth world title and is setting new records all the time.\n\nHamilton has established himself beyond doubt as Britain\u2019s greatest driver and Hill thinks there are many more achievements still to come for the man who could even equal or surpass Schumacher\u2019s record of seven world titles.\n\nHill claims fans turned their back on Formula One during Schumacher's dominance\n\nHamilton complained last year that the Sky Sports analysts \u2014 Hill, Nico Rosberg and Martin Brundle \u2014 had not given him enough credit after his remarkable victory at the German Grand Prix, which he had started from 14th place on the grid.\n\n\u2018I find it amazing listening to the ex-drivers commentating, not a single one of them could find a good word to say,\u2019 said Hamilton. \u2018Whatever the reason is, it\u2019s OK, I forgive you. Positivity and love wins always and no matter what words you use to try and undermine me, I started 14th today and finished first.\u2019\n\nHill does not know whether Hamilton\u2019s words were aimed at him. \u2018I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t mean me,\u2019 he says with another grin. But he is unstinting in his praise now.\n\n\u2018It should be self-evident that Lewis is the greatest racer we\u2019ve ever produced,\u2019 says Hill. \u2018One more to go after this one and he has equalled Schumacher, which was considered to be almost unreachable.\n\n\u2018Year-in and year-out, he has delivered against all comers in all situations and he has got this down to a fine art now, the way he goes about it. He has matured in every respect. He is properly formidable as a competitor. He is probably at the height of his powers and he knows it and he is relaxed about it.\n\nHamilton 'has matured in every respect' and is 'at the height of his powers', says Hill\n\n\u2018Perhaps he doesn\u2019t get the wider credit he deserves but that is a problem with our sport. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s Lewis\u2019s fault. I wonder if it\u2019s the sport itself that has drifted away from the centre of attention.\n\n'The fanbase is still there in the UK but the viewership globally, a lot of people moved away from it when Michael was winning everything.\u2019\n\nHill believes that the standard of driving now is \u2018richer\u2019 than it was when he was competing. He is in awe of the maturity of some of the young racers and their ability to handle the pressure.\n\nHe just wishes the teams and the people who run the sport would give them more responsibility inside the car. He is not the only one who believes it is the key to reviving the sport\u2019s popularity.\n\nHill believes that teams should give racers more responsibility inside the car\n\n\u2018Some people still have a perception that you stick them in the car and they don\u2019t have to do that much,\u2019 Hill says. \u2018When you have an engineer saying, \u201cCan you go a bit slower?\u201d to conserve tyres or something and you are sitting on the couch at home, it\u2019s hard to understand. You want to think about someone going flat out.\n\n\u2018Maybe they need to hand back more responsibility to the driver but they don\u2019t want to do that because they have invested millions of pounds in this and why would they give it to a 20-year-old to screw up? But give it to the 20-year-olds to work out. We want to see whether they can do it. The best guys will work it out. Niki Lauda did. Alain Prost did. Jim Clark did.\n\nHill admits that he was lucky to be given an opportunity and a 'fantastic car' at Williams\n\n\u2018The way they treat them at the moment, it\u2019s like not letting your kids grow up. It\u2019s like going to school with them and then doing their homework. Just leave them.\u2019\n\nAfter lunch, Hill is driven over to Grand Prix Square, where a crowd has gathered in front of a stage, cheering as he is introduced. \u2018My time as a driver is starting to seem like another lifetime ago,\u2019 says Hill. \u2018You can\u2019t stop time.\u2019\n\nTo his right, Suzuka\u2019s big wheel keeps on turning.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: The big wheel at the Suzuka motor racing circuit keeps on turning but in its shadow, things change.", "authors": ["Oliver Holt For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/14/19626644-0-image-a-66_1570886747135.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
