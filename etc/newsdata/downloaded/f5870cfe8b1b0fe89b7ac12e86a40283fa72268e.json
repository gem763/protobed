Dell wrapped its Chromebook launch in service and support plans for enterprises.\n\nIn a blog post, HP noted that more enterprises were looking at Chromebooks given that employees are mostly using web applications. Like Dell, HP is expanding its multi-OS support to include Chrome OS.\n\nHP, which recently outlined its restructuring plans, launched the following:\n\nHP Chromebook Enterprise x360 14E G1, a Chromebook 2-in-1 that features Intel Core i5 and i7 processors and runs up to 13 hours. .\n\nHP Chromebox Enterprise G2, which is designed for frontline workers, shared workspaces and call centers. It can also be configured for kiosks and digital signage.\n\nHP Chromebook Enterprise 14A G5, a laptop that runs on AMD A4 and A6 processors.\n\nThese devices will be available in October and November. All three of the devices will be added to HP's DaaS plans in November.\n\nRelated:", "description": "HP joins Dell Technologies in a move to expand Chrome OS and its devices in the enterprise.", "authors": ["Larry Dignan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/09/7ae96a33-1bff-4914-9aa8-305ab975e6c4/thumbnail/770x578/c65aba4479d24a394ad4a2685d318507/hp-chromebook-tent.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
