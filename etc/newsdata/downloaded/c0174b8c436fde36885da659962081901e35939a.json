But I admit that in recent years doubts have begun to creep in, certainly about their competence, good sense and propriety.\n\nThese doubts have been deepened by the uncensored report by Sir Richard Henriques, a former distinguished judge, into Operation Midland. This investigation entailed the persecution by police of several blameless public figures wrongly accused of the most heinous sexual crimes.\n\nThe report, originally written in 2016, has been published in largely unredacted form (though there are still important omissions, as we will see later) because the Metropolitan Police has been shamed into doing so.\n\nCarl Beech is now serving an 18-year jail term for fabricating a series of claims of rape, torture and murder. He is pictured in a mugshot (left) and being interviewed in January 2016 (right)\n\nAll of us can make mistakes, of course. What is so troubling about Sir Richard\u2019s magnificently forensic account is that officers in the Metropolitan Police behaved not just incompetently but also without compassion or decency.\n\nThe report amplifies what he told the Mail in July \u2013 namely, that the boys in blue misled magistrates in applying for search warrants to raid the homes of Lord Bramall, Lady Brittan and Harvey Proctor.\n\nHow could it happen in this country? How could the Metropolitan Police have displayed the incompetence of the Keystone Kops and \u2013 it pains me to say so \u2013 the ruthlessness and cold-heartedness of the Stasi?\n\nTheir fatal flaw was to give so much credence to bizarre allegations made by the fantasist Carl Beech, previously known as \u2018Nick\u2019, that he was publicly described by one senior officer in 2014 as \u2018credible and true\u2019.\n\nLabour\u2019s deputy leader Tom Watson described Lord Brittan as \u2018as close to evil as any human being could be\u2019\n\nThe loathsome and mendacious Beech, who was himself a paedophile, was jailed for 18 years in July for his \u2018hideous and repugnant\u2019 lies about alleged VIP sex abuse.\n\nHaving read this spine-chilling account of a police force out of control, I\u2019m left with a terrifying reflection. If the constabulary can treat leading public figures like this \u2013 those with powerful friends who know how to look after themselves better than most of us \u2013 then none of us is safe.\n\nNone of us is safe from the knock on the door in the middle of the night, the search of our houses without proper authorisation, and ludicrous and unfounded charges being made against us so that our names and reputations are dragged through the mud.\n\nOne of the victims of police brutality, ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor, told the BBC yesterday how he had lost his job and home as a result of baseless allegations accepted by the police, and had suffered death threats. It\u2019s clear he will never be the same again.\n\nI doubt Lord Bramall, a Second World War hero and former Chief of the Defence Staff, will ever recover from having his Hampshire home searched for ten hours by 20 police, leaving his wife, who suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s, bewildered and confused. She died before he could establish his innocence.\n\nAnd I\u2019m pretty sure that Lady Brittan won\u2019t get over her husband, former Home Secretary Leon Brittan, going to his grave before his name had been cleared of the most unspeakable sexual accusations.\n\nNor should we forget that, shortly after his death, Labour\u2019s deputy leader Tom Watson \u2013 someone who encouraged and supported \u2018Nick\u2019 as he spewed out his invented filth \u2013 described Lord Brittan as \u2018as close to evil as any human being could be\u2019. He finally apologised for this shameful slur.\n\nBut let me deal with the police\u2019s idiocies and cruelties in more detail before coming back to Mr Watson. Sir Richard\u2019s enumeration of an incredible 43 separate failings is a terrible indictment of their investigation.\n\nScotland Yard\u2019s egregious errors range from failing to consult the Wiltshire force (to whom Beech had given conflicting evidence), to not examining his computer early in the inquiry, to interviewing his mother, a vicar, very late in the day. Her testimony undermined her son\u2019s lurid stories of childhood rape.\n\nAstonishingly, the phrase \u2018highly implausible\u2019 occurs 14 times in Sir Richard\u2019s report. For example: \u2018I find it highly implausible that a former prime minister, a home secretary, former heads of MI5 and MI6, two field marshals, a former Conservative MP and a television presenter would have conspired together to inflict grievous bodily harm and to rape numerous young boys.\u2019\n\nYou can say that again! But the police lost any sense of what was likely as they ploughed on regardless, turning a blind eye to evidence that did not suit their theories, and failing to follow sensible lines of inquiry.\n\nLord Bramall (right) is a Second World War hero and former Chief of the Defence Staff who had his Hampshire home searched for ten hours by 20 police. Former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor (left) told the BBC yesterday how he had lost his job and home as a result of baseless allegations accepted by the police\n\nAlmost unbelievably, it did occur at one stage to the senior officer in charge of Operation Midland, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse, that \u2018Nick may have fabricated some or all of his allegations\u2019. But such qualms were set aside, and the investigation continued.\n\nAlthough other officers made mistakes, Mr Rodhouse must carry the can. Yet after the inquiry was wrapped up in early 2016, having been recognized by police top brass as a fiasco, he was promoted to a \u00a3175,000-a-year post at the National Crime Agency. A reward for failure?\n\nNot a single police officer has so far been required to resign as a consequence of a futile and ill-judged inquiry that caused a great deal of unnecessary pain to a lot of people.\n\nYesterday the Metropolitan Police declared itself \u2018deeply, deeply sorry\u2019. But I hardly think belated contrition is sufficient recompense for such ineptitude and inhumanity, and a debacle of this magnitude.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that Lady Brittan (right) won\u2019t get over her husband, former Home Secretary Leon Brittan (left), going to his grave before his name had been cleared of the most unspeakable sexual accusations, writes STEPHEN GLOVER\n\nThat brings me back to Mr Watson. I don\u2019t doubt he believed Nick\u2019s fantastical allegations. But it surely can\u2019t be denied that he was partly driven by a desire to damage high-profile Tories (Lord Brittan and Mr Proctor) and Lord Bramall, a member of the old Establishment.\n\nThe pressure he applied to the police didn\u2019t merely concern Operation Midland. Mr Watson also urged them to pursue a false rape allegation dating back nearly 50 years against Lord Brittan from someone known as \u2018Jane\u2019. She was revealed to have had paranoid delusions and psychiatric problems.\n\nYet Lord Brittan was hounded by Scotland Yard while terminally ill with cancer in a hospital bed. Shamefully, all references to this particular investigation have been redacted from yesterday\u2019s supposedly uncensored report.\n\nAlthough Lady Brittan is reported to believe Mr Watson should resign, I don\u2019t imagine this pugnacious political street fighter will give up his career in a moment of uncharacteristic remorse. All the same, he has sacrificed whatever reputation for decency he possessed.\n\nBut we are entitled to expect more from the police. Asking for heads to roll is not a matter of petty score-settling. Their good name, and their standing with the public, is at stake.\n\nDoes Scotland Yard grasp the extent of its failings? An apology, though welcome, can only be a beginning. Proof is needed that the Metropolitan Police understands how very disquieting its behaviour has been.\n\nI don\u2019t know what will emerge from the investigation by Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary ordered by the Home Secretary, Priti Patel. We need much more than syrupy words of regret, though.\n\nWhat is required is reassurance that the homes of innocent people will not again be raided by police officers acting on spurious allegations dreamt up by a malign lunatic.", "description": "STEPHEN GLOVER: What is so troubling about Sir Richard's forensic account is that officers in the Metropolitan Police behaved not just incompetently but also without decency.", "authors": ["Stephen Glover For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/22/19314220-0-image-a-19_1570223106766.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
