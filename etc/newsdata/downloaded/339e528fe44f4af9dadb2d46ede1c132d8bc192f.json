The Pumas deserved to be short-handed, it was a really bad tackle and one of the great arts of tournament rugby is keeping 15 players on the pitch for 80 minutes under extreme pressure.\n\nWe have often seen short-handed teams raise their game significantly, while those with a full complement can take their foot off the gas and struggle. England didn't do that, the only time they lost momentum was when the game was won and the bonus point had been garnered midway through the second half.\n\nThen, for 10 to 15 minutes as Eddie Jones emptied the bench to give much needed game-time to those who have been injured or not starting, England marked time a little and the Pumas scored their solitary try. I was delighted to see England then finish with a flourish.\n\nEngland put on an impressive display to book their place in the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals\n\nNigel Owens showed Tomas Lavanini (left) a straight red card for a poor tackle on Owen Farrell\n\nEddie will be pleased. No dramas other than a knock to Billy Vunipola and a full week to prepare for France in the knowledge that they have already qualified for the quarter-finals. It is all such a vivid contrast to the stress, worry and selection rows raging in the media at the same stage four years ago.\n\nHaving said that, England need to stay in top gear this week. The France match still matters massively. The famous statistic of World Cup winning teams never losing a pool game is worth bearing in mind. And, although fearing no opponent, I am convinced that, deep down, Eddie would prefer England to be playing Australia in a fortnight, rather than Wales.\n\nYou don't want to be going into a World Cup quarter-final with a defeat hanging over you but the main point is that this England team can \u2014 must \u2014 go up two or three gears. To do that, the Gun XV need to keep playing together, give or take necessary changes for injuries.\n\nThe Argentina No 5 produced a dangerous high tackle on England fly-half Owen Farrell\n\nThe big thing to work on is the box kicking, which was the one disappointment from England on Saturday. Kick that poorly again and better teams will run the ball back to much more devastating effect.\n\nBut England were mostly poised, efficient and disciplined when it counted. There was some handbags but England kept their composure at key moments. They didn't go in high, they didn't retaliate and they didn't give Nigel Owens cause to get on their case.\n\nI would single out the skipper Owen Farrell in this respect. He knew Argentina would be coming after him and it wasn't long before the Pumas captain Pablo Matera left his calling card with a late shot. Then came the red card incident with Tomas Lavanini which again could have unsettled Farrell. But he was right in the zone on Saturday.\n\nDespite playing against 14-men, England had to keep their cool against a fiery Argentina\n\nA couple of times I saw him withdraw from a tackle because he clearly felt his body position wasn't right and there was a possibility of it going wrong. It takes great focus and cool to do that in a full-on Test match.\n\nEngland had to defend hard in the first five or 10 minutes to deny Argentina but we knew the Pumas would be quick out of the blocks. After that, England started to take control.\n\nThe red card? Well, there can be no complaints. Argentina knew that and there were no histrionics. The player knew, his skipper didn't try to argue and up in the coaches box Mario Ledesma and Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe looked resigned.\n\nThe curious bit about the dismissal was that initially the referee waved it on, making a point of shouting 'no foul play'. He seemed to have a decent line of vision but I suspect what might have foxed him was the big left arm that came round in a sweeping, wrapping movement which at full speed rather masked the reality. These incidents happen so quickly it can be a little difficult to process at first but you can never fool the cameras.\n\nDespite already qualifying, it is important England win their next game against France\n\nWhen you slowed it down it was a clear shoulder-first shot at the neck/head area and although Farrell dipped a little it wasn't enough to offer any genuine mitigation. The reality of rugby in 2019 is that tacklers must go in lower \u2014 below the level of the ball \u2014 because it gives you some flexibility if the ball carrier dips or unexpectedly changes direction. It will also play out well with referees who are looking for mitigating circumstances.\n\nYou can guarantee the last thing Owens wanted to do on Saturday was send a player off after 17 minutes. If there had been mitigation he could have gone for a yellow but red was the correct call.\n\nArgentina disappointed me. They are a shadow of the 2015 team and I'm not sure where that magic has gone. I have certainly never agreed with their decision to largely ostracise players based in Europe. It has backfired.\n\nWorld Rugby needs to make sure Argentina and Italy don't fall by the wayside\n\nIt is worrying. World rugby needs a strong Argentina while we have almost given up waiting for Italy to break through. I was very disappointed with their 49-3 defeat against South Africa on Friday and not just because of the poor quality of their play.\n\nItaly's team selection seemed all wrong. Sergio Parisse should not have started, he has hit the wall \u2014 it happens to every great player at some stage \u2014 and their back row now works better without him.\n\nMichele Campagnaro and Jayden Hayward were out of position in the backs, while Callum Braley is a smoother link at nine than Tito Tebaldi.\n\nSouth Africa was their biggest match in four years and before they had even kicked off, Italy had given themselves a massive handicap.", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: We have often seen short-handed teams raise their game significantly, while those with a full complement can take their foot off the gas and struggle.", "authors": ["Sir Clive Woodward For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/19/19339820-0-image-a-22_1570300879290.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
