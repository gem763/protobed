UPDATE 2-FTSE 100 hits near 2-month high as rate cut remarks enfeeble sterling\n\n* FTSE 100 up 1%, FTSE 250 up 0.8%\n\n* Exporters gain as pound drops\n\n* Persimmon rises on Jefferies upgrade\n\n\n\n(Adds news items, analyst comment, updates to closing prices)\n\nBy Yadarisa Shabong and Muvija M\n\nSept 27 (Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 index hit a\n\nnear-two-month high on Friday, outperforming European peers, as\n\nexporters were bolstered by an ailing pound after a Bank of\n\nEngland policymaker hinted at an interest rate cut, while hopes\n\nof a U.S-China trade deal also lifted the mood.\n\nThe globally-exposed FTSE 100 jumped more than 1%,\n\nsurprisingly ending the week in the black thanks to substantial\n\ngains in the last two sessions.\n\nA lack of any major chipmaker presence shielded the index\n\nfrom a profit warning from Nasdaq-listed Micron Technology\n\n, helping it outperform European's main index.\n\nThe domestically-focused FTSE 250 , which had broken\n\nranks with sterling, rose 0.8%.\n\nIn a first clear sign that the BoE is considering a cut,\n\npolicymaker Michael Saunders said it may need to cut interest\n\nrates in the likely scenario that high levels of uncertainty\n\nover Brexit persist. \"This is significant as Saunders has traditionally been a\n\nhawkish voice on the Monetary Policy Committee,\" CMC Markets\n\nanalyst Michael Hewson said.\n\nEven as the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline approaches, very little\n\nis clear about how or even whether the UK will leave the\n\nEuropean Union. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in a standoff\n\nwith parliament after vowing to Britain out of the bloc on Oct.\n\n31, with or without a deal.\n\nAs a weaker pound boosts the value of exporters' revenue\n\nfrom overseas, international companies such as oil majors Royal\n\nDutch Shell and BP and Asia-facing lender HSBC\n\nwere the biggest boost on the main index.\n\nHopes that a drawn-out China-U.S. trade dispute might be\n\nnearing a solution also helped sentiment after China said on\n\nThursday it was in close communication with the United States\n\nover trade talks next month. Gains of roughly 1% in the last two sessions helped the FTSE\n\n100 recoup some of the losses seen in August, when it suffered\n\nits worst monthly fall since October last year due to heightened\n\nconcerns over global trade and recession.\n\nFriday's surge has put the index course for its biggest\n\nmonthly gain since April, albeit a flat quarter.\n\nLeading gains on the main index, Britain's second-largest\n\nhomebuilder, Persimmon , jumped 5.2% after the brokerage\n\nJefferies said Brexit risks had been overplayed in the sector,\n\nand upgraded the stock. A sub-index of housebuilders touched its\n\nhighest level in almost a year.\n\nOffshore oilfield services contractor Gulf Marine\n\npared earlier gains to end 2% up after signing a deal with\n\nlenders to provide cash till year-end, while mid-cap utility\n\nPennon Group scaled a more than one-year high after\n\nmaintaining targets.\n\n\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 2-FTSE 100 hits near 2-month high as rate cut remarks enfeeble sterling", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/04884b1911db56b353dbce418a99df8d_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
