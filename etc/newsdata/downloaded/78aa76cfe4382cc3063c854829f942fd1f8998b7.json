Something like:\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s a comedian.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it was a slur.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut comedians use slurs all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it was a slur about a different racial group, not his own.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it was a joke!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it was a lame joke.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what got Shane Gillis in trouble. In the first clip below, from last year, you\u2019ll hear him say, \u201cChinatown\u2019s f***ing nuts. Let the f***ing ch*nks live there, huh?\u201d In the second, he imitates broken English spoken by someone Asian. Both exchanges are tedious and hackneyed more than offensive; they\u2019re also loaded with profanity, so take proper precautions if you\u2019re at work. Complicating SNL\u2019s decision about him was the fact that they just added the first Asian cast member in the show\u2019s long history, Bowen Yang. What\u2019s the greater handicap to Asian-Americans \u2014 being overlooked for 45 years by America\u2019s premier late-night comedy ensemble or Gillis bro-ing out with his thoughts on Chinatown?\n\ntoday SNL announced the hiring of its first cast member of East Asian descent, and also this guy pic.twitter.com/0FAGJZJUkK \u2014 Seth Simons (@sasimons) September 12, 2019\n\nthis, again, is from September 2018 pic.twitter.com/inYFT22zjl \u2014 Seth Simons (@sasimons) September 12, 2019\n\nHe was dinged for other crimes against progress after SNL announced his addition to the cast. And so today the axe fell:\n\nAnd in a statement, an \u201cSNL\u201d spokesperson on behalf of \u201cSNL\u201d boss Lorne Michaels, told Page Six: \u201cAfter talking with Shane Gillis, we have decided that he will not be joining \u2018SNL.\u2019 \u201cWe want \u2018SNL\u2019 to have a variety of voices and points of view within the show, and we hired Shane on the strength of his talent as comedian and his impressive audition for \u2018SNL.\u2019 We were not aware of his prior remarks that have surfaced over the past few days. The language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable. We are sorry that we did not see these clips earlier, and that our vetting process was not up to our standard.\u201d\n\nGillis replied:\n\nHe tried to clean it up a few days ago, saying that he meant no harm and offering to apologize to anyone who\u2019s offended. Didn\u2019t work.\n\nI wonder if people would have gone dumpster diving through his old podcasts if he\u2019d been signed for a movie or a sitcom or whatever. It may have been his misfortune to land briefly on late night, which from Monday through Saturday is now the wokest jurisdiction on American television. That\u2019s the left\u2019s space now, and SNL even more so given how much it depends during the Trump era on flattering educated liberal sensibilities. Keeping this guy on in that context would have been strange. Pity him, though, for having endured one of the special cruelties of cancel culture, having your dirty laundry aired *right after* you\u2019ve achieved your professional dream. It\u2019s like Kyler Murray getting zapped for offensive tweets he sent in his younger teenaged years days after he won the Heisman. No one cares about policing wokeness in people until the very moment they become hugely successful and potential cultural influencers. And so inevitably one of the best days of their lives becomes one of the worst.\n\nHere\u2019s Andrew Yang with a gracious take on Gillis\u2019s slur this weekend. Yes, it\u2019s hurtful, he says. No, he doesn\u2019t want to see a guy lose his life\u2019s ambition over it. Especially a guy who tells outre jokes for a living.", "description": "\"I was always a mad tv guy anyway.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
