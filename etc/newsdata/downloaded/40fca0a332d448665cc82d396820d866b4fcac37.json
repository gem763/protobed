Is our judgment fatally flawed by too many episodes of Sex and the City and too many romcoms? Has it been skewed irrevocably by too many articles in Vogue such as the recent puff piece on Claudia Schiffer\u2019s country retreat, which contains the classic lines: \u2018In the kitchen, micro-greens grow in a container\u2019 and the fact that her husband, film producer Matthew Vaughn, \u2018might take a helicopter to the set and come back, so he can sleep in his own house\u2019? Do we now have such ridiculous expectations of how our life should be, how the men in it should behave, that nothing is ever good enough? Or are we simply expecting the best because we have set higher standards for ourselves? Is it self-delusion, or self-care?\n\nSo let\u2019s examine this conundrum by looking at what happened on my birthday. I can\u2019t decide whether it was lovely or simply not good enough. I think we need a people\u2019s vote. I\u2019m either a very lucky woman, or terribly disregarded and spurned.\n\nIn the preceding days, David had kept sending me gifts. Two vintage books on the Beatles (one of which, Shout!, he had borrowed in 1983 and never returned), followed by a curious gift, one which meant I had to get out of my oily bath to answer the door to the delivery man. \u2018This had better be worth it,\u2019 I growled at him and he backed away, frightened.\n\nI opened the envelope, and it was a bookmark, made by David Linley. And a note: \u2018Happy birthday, my darling Liz. X\u2019\n\nOK, so these were merely Holding Presents. Let\u2019s not get carried away with the hanging just yet.\n\nFor my actual Special Day, I\u2019d booked a raft of treatments at a luxury hotel near Harrogate. Hair dye, pedicure, waxing (not an extreme bikini, though, as in the North it\u2019s regarded to be as evil and invasive as fracking) and a massage, followed by an hour in the hot tub on the roof. For the first time since the internet was invented, I had posted an \u2018out of office\u2019 notice on my email. I suggested to David, who was back home in London, that he join me for dinner at 7pm. \u2018That sounds like a perfect plan.\u2019\n\nIt was lovely, in the conservatory, waiting for a man. It certainly beat last year, when I\u2019d had a drink in my local hotel The Fleece with the puppies on my own, and two readers had come up to me and exclaimed, to the rest of the room: \u2018It\u2019s Liz Jones. And is this Mini? Why are you having a drink on your own? Isn\u2019t it your 60th birthday???!!!!\u2019\n\nThe waitress brought me a free bottle of champagne. David arrived, after a drive that took six hours (one bonus point; made an effort), and he looked handsome in jeans and a jacket (two more points). He pecked me on the cheek, poured the champagne. I\u2019d half expected flowers, but I suppose they would have wilted on the journey, and he must have read how I hate it when men bring flowers on a romantic date: it\u2019s really naff and things always get knocked over. But something small to unwrap would have been nice. Perhaps he was waiting until we got home that night. (One point pending.)\n\nI can\u2019t decide whether my birthday was lovely or not good enough\n\nWe chatted. I had vegan curry made with oyster mushrooms. He had ice cream for pudding (minus one point. Can you imagine Claudia Schiffer allowing Matthew Vaughn to eat ice cream?). He drove us back to my cottage, where the dogs went mad. He brought in his holdall. I waited. And I waited. No gift. Not even a bottle of bubbly. OK, perhaps the gift is still in his car, and he will give it to me tomorrow. Which is slightly passive aggressive. Asking for trouble. Teasing me. But let\u2019s not jump to conclusions quite yet.\n\nI went to bed, wondering, well, perhaps the fact he bought dinner (\u00a370; I gave the tip in cash) is present enough? Am I being unreasonable? But I couldn\u2019t help but be a little put out. When he kept waking me up, I snapped, \u2018Can you please stop moving around?\u2019\n\n\u2018OK,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ll go and sleep in the spare room.\u2019\n\nWhich he did. Now, you see my mum would never have said that to my dad. And she would have been content with a box of Milk Tray. So should I be happy, or should I be very upset? I honestly have no idea\u2026\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s now my Birthday Boxing Day. Will he suggest we do anything? Will he cook?
