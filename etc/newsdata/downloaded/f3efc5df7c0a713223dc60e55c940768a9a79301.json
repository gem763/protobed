Eventually, they could gather enough data from humans to train machines to mimic them.\"\n\nHow often is an employee going out to smoke a cigarette? How long a lunch are they taking? How long are they sitting in the lunchroom?\" These are the questions clients want answered with AI software, says Kim Hartman, CEO of Surveillance Secure, a D.C.-area company that installs security systems.\n\nHartman says his company has put in video analytics for several area retailers and restaurants that wanted to monitor their employees' productivity.\n\nIn a handful of factories in the U.S., cameras have been installed over each worker's head in assembly lines as they put together car parts or electronics.\n\nSoftware developed by Drishti, a Silicon Valley startup, watches these assemblers work, timing each step and checking for mistakes.\n\nThe videos let supervisors quickly figure out where something went wrong and teach a worker how to avoid repeating an error, says Drishti CEO Prasad Akella. It can also be used for training new hires.\n\nAnd since AI is constantly watching the video streams, it can extract valuable data about timing and actions across the entire assembly line, which can inform new ways of assigning work.\n\n\"The most programmable machine on the planet today is still the human.\"\n\n\u2014 Drishti CEO Prasad Akella\n\n\"Employers and companies attempting to extract more value from its labor force by making that labor more efficient is nothing new,\" says Jess Kutch, co-founder of Coworker.org, a nonprofit that helps workers organize. A century ago, managers used stopwatches to pursue efficiency under the banner of \"scientific management,\" or Taylorism.\n\nBut extreme monitoring enabled by new technologies can be inhumane, Kutch says.\n\n\"In low-wage work we're seeing a lot more decisions that were made by a middle manager being outsourced to an algorithm,\" says Aiha Nguyen of the research organization Data & Society.\n\n\"What workers are seeing, and have a fear of, is arbitrarily speeding up workplaces,\" Nguyen tells Axios.\n\nThe creators of AI monitoring tools argue that their software benefits employers and employees.\n\nDrishti provides workers and supervisors with valuable feedback, Akella says. Its software can call out high performers, reward efficiency-improving creativity and even keep workers from hurting themselves.\n\nAkella argues that employees won't be forced to work much faster and harder because turning up the heat would introduce unacceptable errors.\n\nCall center agents monitored by AI software from CallMiner prefer being graded by an \"impartial computer\" over a human supervisor, says CTO Jeff Gallino.\n\nWhat's next: Extensive AI-annotated video or audio data about how people work is a potential gold mine for automation developers.\n\nRobots are still too klutzy to take over assembly lines built for humans but could learn how to put together products in a machine-only environment.\n\nGallino says CallMiner could use information gathered from human agents to automate the \"boring\" parts of customer service calls.\n\nGo deeper: Automated management for call centers (NYT)", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
