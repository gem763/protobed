The detention of these citizens, who do not hold dual Iranian nationality, is unprecedented in recent years. It gives the impression that Iran considers itself to have nothing to lose. But the nation is playing a dangerous roulette with its global diplomatic relations.\n\nSince the UK and Australia announced that both their navies would potentially take part in a US-led maritime force to guarantee freedom of navigation in the Strait of Hormuz, Iran is experiencing a new era of insecurity. Despite propaganda efforts, Iranian official know the facts: Iran has brought the biggest western maritime force to its borders. Defusing US efforts to consolidate its military power in the region is one motivating factor behind this latest series of detentions.\n\nThese arrests are not arbitrary. In the middle of the transition between Theresa May and Boris Johnson\u2019s governments, Iran announced the detention of the British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero. Now, in the midst of Brexit rollercoaster, it has been leaked that Iran is detaining British citizens. Iran acted on May\u2019s weakness, and on Johnson\u2019s imprudence. People all over the world (not only in Iran) have concluded that Boris Johnson\u2019s government is prorogued on foreign policy so much as the House of Commons is prorogued on Brexit.\n\nIran well remembers that, during his time as foreign secretary, Boris Johnson's remarks over the imprisonment of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian citizen jailed in Iran on spying charges which she denies, nudged her deeper into her predicament. Johnson is now prime minister, and Iran has taken British citizens with no Iranian dual nationality hostages. In both cases, he has stood by helplessly.\n\nBut if you take a closer look at Iran\u2019s impasse with west, it's clear that Iran is not only taking citizens hostages, but whole European states too. In scaling back its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal, by firing up advanced centrifuges that enrich uranium at a faster rate, Iran forced the remaining European signatories (the UK, France and Germany) to their knees. On Wednesday, Angela Merkel said on that Europe had decided to uphold the Iran nuclear deal, and \u201cstep by step we will keep trying to find solutions with Iran that prevent an escalation of tensions in a globally sensitive region. That\u2019s our job.\u201d\n\nSo now the situation looks like this: Iran still has Stena Impero, and has transferred the oil on board Adrian Darya 1 (previously known as Grace 1) to Syria \u2013 despite reassurances given to the UK; it is reneging on its commitment to the nuclear deal terms, and continues rebuffing Donald Trump\u2019s calls for talks with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani. Meanwhile, on the other side, the US and its allies have the military pressure on the Iran\u2019s doorsteps. Iran is adopting a similar \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on the west to torpedo Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy towards its economy and own security in the Gulf.\n\nAnd, so far, it seems to be working.\n\nRead more\n\nAs prorogation is declared unlawful, it's Labour I feel sorry for", "description": "In detaining British and Australian citizens, Iran has sent a clear message to the Europe and the West: falling in line with the US on Iran comes with severe consequences.This time, the nation has taken the hostage diplomacy game to a new level.
