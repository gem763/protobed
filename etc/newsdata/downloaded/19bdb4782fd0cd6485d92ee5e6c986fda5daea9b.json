So Rinna jumped on the chance in September to do an interview via Google Hangouts.\n\nThe interviewer for the food packaging company seemed to want to fill a real job.\n\n\"At first, she seemed pretty legit,\" said Rinna, a mother of three who lives in Taylor, Michigan. \"She was pretty formal.\"\n\nNo, they never talked by phone. No, they didn't do a video chat. Just chatting by text via Google Hangouts.\n\nBut maybe, Rinna hoped, this could be a real job as an administrative assistant. The pay was great: $26 an hour during her training period and after that $29 an hour.\n\nAsk for federal tax extension?: Your time to file is almost up\n\nUS workers spend $7,685 a year on health: Here's how to make your costs more manageable\n\nWho interviews for a job via Google?\n\nThen the company ended up sending a cashier's check via FedEx for around $1,099. She was to deposit the check in her bank and use the money to buy a fax machine, a copy machine and a MacBook Pro to work from home.\n\nOK, but all that stuff would have cost her around $3,000, based on her estimates.\n\nShe began to wonder if the check was even real. She called the bank that supposedly issued the check out of the Washington, D.C., area. She discovered it was a fake check, thankfully before she deposited it.\n\nStefanie Rinna, 26, of Taylor, was targeted by scammers and nearly lost roughly $1,000 in scheme that promised a high paying job and started out with an interview via Google Hangouts. (Photo: Stefanie Rinna)\n\n\"If I would have put that into my checking account, I would have owed all that money back and I don't have all that money to pay back,\" she said.\n\nThe first red flag, she says now, should have been that interview: \"Who does an interview through Google Hangouts, for one?\"\n\nMillennials are losing cash to scammers\n\nSo you think retirees are the only ones being targeted by scammers? Not at all.\n\nMillennials in their 20s and 30s are falling at a fast clip for online shopping fraud, con artists who pretend to be your boss, imposters who pretend to be from the federal government, fake check scams and business opportunities or work-at-home jobs.\n\nMillennials, for example, are twice as likely as people who are 40 and older to report losing money while shopping online, according to reports to the Federal Trade Commission's Consumer Sentinel Network.\n\nAnd it often doesn't start with a robocall. Millennials are 77% more likely to report losing money to a scam that starts out with an email.\n\nAnd millennials are 93% more likely than people age 40 or older to report losing money to fake check scams \u2013 which can be part of some frauds that are designed to look like one step along the way for finding a cure for a financial headache.\n\nAlexa, why are you charging me a fee?\n\nScammers, of course, chase the latest trends and now they're trying to convince consumers that they must pay $80 to $100 to activate a new media player, virtual assistant, and other tech devices, such as Roku, Google Home or Alexa, according to a new warning from the Better Business Bureau.\n\nHere's how the scam works: You search for a customer support number online. But instead of getting the official website, you end up with a phony, look-alike site. You call that number and you are told there is a new policy in place: All device users must now pay an activation fee.\n\nThe scammers may ask for prepaid gift cards or they may ask directly for your credit card number. \"In some cases, they may 'help' you come up with a new username and password, thereby gaining access to your device account,\" the BBB warns.\n\nScammers have more luck using social media\n\nNew fraud research \u2013 a joint report by the FINRA Investor Education Foundation, the Better Business Bureau and the Stanford Center for Longevity \u2013 indicated that people are most likely to be ripped off when it comes to online purchases and scams that start off via social media or fake websites.\n\n\"When phone and email were used by scammers to target consumers, relatively few consumers engaged with the scammer or lost money,\" according to the report called \"Exposed to Scams: What Separates Victims from Non-Victims?\"\n\n\"However, when exposed to a scam on social media, 91% engaged and 53% lost money.\"\n\nThose more likely to become victims, according to the report, included: Someone who feels lonely or experiences being isolated, perhaps widowed or divorced; younger adults who are under financial strain.\n\nWhat can help someone avoid a scam: Some media buzz about a particular scam or hearing word-of-mouth warnings about rip-offs. One-third of consumers who were targeted by a scammer \u2013\u2014 but did not engage \u2013 already knew about a specific scam, according to the \"Exposed to Scams\" research.\n\nIt's not hard to lose $400 to $600\n\nThe \"Exposed to Scams\" researchers surveyed 1,408 Americans and Canadians who were targeted by scammers and reported the fraud to the BBB. Nearly have of those surveyed did not engage with the fraudster. However, nearly a quarter lost an average of $600.\n\nMillennials reported losing $400 based on the median individual loss \u2013 where half of the losses are higher and half are lower, according to FTC data. That's much lower than other age groups where a median loss of $500 was reported for those age 40-59; a loss of $640 was reported for people age 60-79, and $1,700 was reported for people 80 an older.\n\nWe're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars lost to clever crooks.\n\nMillennials reported losing nearly $450 million to fraud in just the past two years, according to the FTC \u2013 and online shopping accounted for $71 million in losses.\n\nContact Susan Tompor at 313-222-8876 or stompor@freepress.com.
