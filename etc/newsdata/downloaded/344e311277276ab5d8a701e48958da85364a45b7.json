(AP) - The Trail Blazers kicked off their 50th anniversary season with a preseason game where it all started, Portland\u2019s Memorial Coliseum.\n\nThe Blazers played at the Memorial Coliseum for 25 seasons from 1970-95 before moving to the Rose Garden, now the Moda Center. On Tuesday night the Blazers opened the preseason against the Denver Nuggets, the first of several special events to be held surrounding the anniversary.\n\nBlazers coach Terry Stotts wore a burnt-orange leisure suit for the occasion, and fans were entertained by organ music.\n\nBut the Nuggets spoiled the party with a 105-94 victory, led by Paul Millsap\u2019s 14 points. Mario Hezonja paced the Blazers with 12 points.\n\nThere were several former Portland players and executives on hand, including Geoff Petrie, who was named Rookie of the Year with the Blazers that first season and later became the team\u2019s general manager. He said he remembers when the Blazers were drawing just 3,500 a game.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of fun there for that brief moment in time,\u201d Petrie said. \u201cI look back very fondly on those years, and everything that came after it.\u201d\n\nIt was the preseason debut of center Hassan Whiteside, who was among seven new players to join the Blazers in the offseason. Whiteside was acquired in a trade with the Miami Heat.\n\nThe Nuggets did not play Nikola Jokic because they are managing his minutes. Former Blazer Mason Plumlee started at center.\n\nPortland eliminated Denver in the Western Conference semifinals in seven games last season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Trail Blazers kicked off their 50th anniversary season with a preseason game where it all started, Portland's Memorial Coliseum.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
