The USTR documents make it clear, however, that the exemptions are not permanent, which leaves the door open to reimposing them later on.\n\nThe move comes as U.S. and Chinese negotiators had face-to-face talks in Washington this week. With another round of tariffs set to be implemented soon, strategist Chris Krueger of Cowan Research Group said \"we would interpret another delay as a goodwill gesture.\"\n\nLast week, China made such a gesture of its own by exempting 16 different types of U.S. agricultural products, including soybeans and pork, from its own import levies, a move that Krueger described as \"the quid for the quo of some tariff relief.\"\n\n\"All of this could go sideways [again],\" he said, but added that even such a modest rapprochement on the trade file could be \"a signal that the trade war is entering into a frozen conflict.\"", "description": "The U.S. has exempted another 437 types of products from China from the tariffs Washington\u00a0had previously\u00a0threatened to impose on them, in the latest sign that the combatants in the Sino-American trade war are perhaps becoming gun-shy.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5291036.1568985742!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/shanghai-bicycle.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
