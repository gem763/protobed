But when asked about his relationship status, Cameron played coy.\n\n'THE BACHELORETTE' HANNAH BROWN SPEAKS OUT AFTER TYLER CAMERON, GIGI HADID GO ON DATE\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just friends,\u201d he told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cI mean\u2026 that\u2019s just where we\u2019re at. Our relationship doesn\u2019t need to be public. She\u2019s good people, she\u2019s an amazing person and we\u2019re just keeping it friendly.\u201d\n\nCameron said that after being on a reality TV dating show, he'd rather keep his personal life private.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m at the point where I don\u2019t really want to talk about my relationships,\" he explained. \"I\u2019ve dated publicly, so\u2026 I\u2019m trying to date privately and I\u2019m not in love with anybody right now.

We have a great time together.\"\n\nAnd although they might be in the same industry, Cameron bowed down to Hadid's career covering magazines, designing, and walking runways.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a little bit more big-time than I am,\u201d he joked. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty good at what she does. I don\u2019t really try to talk [about modeling] with [Gigi]. I just try to enjoy the moment.\u201d\n\nGIGI HADID AND TYLER CAMERON SPOTTED ON DATE IN UPSTATE NEW YORK\n\nHe continued: \"Modeling has been a blessing. I've got great people in my corner there that I love working with. I'm so new to that world and that industry. I'm just having fun with it and making a name of myself if I can. But it's using it as a vehicle to get the goals I want to obtain, which is construction and real estate [back in Florida].\"\n\nCameron did tease that he has a big, new campaign coming out soon.", "description": "Tyler Cameron has been making headlines all summer long because of not one but two high-profile relationships.", "authors": ["Jessica Napoli"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/tylerC.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
