Analysts polled by FactSet expected $47.44 billion in revenue for the latest period.\n\nProfit rose to almost $1.10 billion, or $2.47 a share, from $1.04 billion, or $2.36 a share, the year earlier. Analysts expected $2.54 a share in adjusted profit.\n\nThe company recorded what it called a $123 million pretax reserve related to a product-tax assessment in the quarter, lowering earnings.\n\nAlong with rival Walmart Inc., Costco has shown it can draw in customers and notch higher sales in a shifting retail market. Investors have responded by bidding up shares in the Issaquah, Wash.-based company 42% so far this year.\n\nThe company has been helped along by consumer spending, which has been a strength for the U.S. economy for much of the year amid worries about slowing global growth and uncertainty related to tariffs. However, household spending rose just 0.1% in August from July on a seasonally adjusted basis, slower than the first seven months of the year.\n\nComparable sales, or those from Costco warehouses open for more than a year as well as online sales, increased 5% for the company's quarter that ended Sept. 1. Comparable sales in the U.S. were up about 6%.\n\nShares of Costco fell 1.6% in postmarket trading.\n\nWrite to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 03, 2019 16:56 ET (20:56 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
