I can't imagine a better copy can be found,\" he said.\n\nOnly 500 copies were published in the book's first print run, with 300 of those sent to libraries.\n\nThe hardback was among 12 Harry Potter first editions for sale at the auction, including one signed by JK Rowling.\n\nYou may also like:", "description": "A 1997 Harry Potter first edition that was given to a family has fetched a princely sum at auction.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C39D/production/_109177005_potter.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
