It imposes a tariff of more than 500 percent on rice imports.\n\n\"It's difficult to be recognised any longer as a developing nation in international society considering our economic status,\" Hong said at a nationally televised address. \"The government will do everything it can to provide maximum protection in sensitive agricultural areas such as rice in future WTO negotiations.\"\n\nThe Finance Ministry said in a separate statement that South Korea is not giving up privileges it has already secured as a developing nation and that the decision only affects future WTO talks. South Korea will also continue to honour WTO-endorsed agreements previously signed among developing nations, it said.\n\nThe US has pressured the WTO to change how it designates developing countries, especially China, with which it is engaged in a trade war.\n\n\"This is a win for Trump pressuring China,\" said Cheong In-kyo, a professor of international trade at South Korea's Inha University. \"China now has one fewer reason to hold on to its developing-nation status.\"\n\nThe WTO allows countries that claim the status to enjoy longer transition periods for implementing trade deals and protection against emergency import restrictions by developed nations.\n\nWarning of unilateral action in July, Trump named China, Brunei, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Macau, Qatar, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Turkey and South Korea as those unworthy of the status. Singapore has since said it would not seek privileges granted by the status in negotiations.", "description": "US President Trump has been pressuring several countries to drop their 'developing' status which comes with privileges.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/25/62e67433854d464390d7076acdef49d4_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
