You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cIf your weight is below that range, biological changes due to calorie deprivation happen, and generally push you back into your set range. However, if you stay within your set range - at the lower end of it - you should be able to maintain that weight without your body making those negative changes.\u201d\n\nBut Dr Giles Yeo, who presents BBC\u2019s Trust Me, I\u2019m a Doctor, explains that Mann\u2019s advice is irresponsible because it could be interpreted as suggesting people become as \u201cskinny as possible\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The problem with many of Goop\u2019s recommendations is that they are not based on science, but pseudo-science.\u201d\n\nYeo went on to describe Mann\u2019s concept of calculating your \u201cleanest liveable weight\u201d as \u201csilly\u201d because there is no scientific formula way to determine such a figure, something Mann acknowledges in the interview.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore nigh-on impossible to find a target to stick to,\" Yeo continued. \"People should not be afraid of food, and \u2018diet\u2019 should not have become such a loaded term. Goop is part of the reason that people have become afraid of eating. We need to love our food, just eat less of it.\u201d\n\nIn response to Yeo's comments, Mann told The Daily Mail she is \"strongly and clearly opposed to strict dieting\".\n\n\u201cIn fact, the article is specifically about not dieting, not trying to lose too much weight and not doing anything unhealthy or extreme,\" Mann added.\n\n\u201cThe phrase \u2018leanest liveable weight\u2019 refers to the leanest weight you can be without doing any strict dieting or unhealthy behaviour.\u201d\n\nGoop has previously been criticised for promoting health treatments on its site without scientific evidence. In September last year, the company agreed to pay a settlement of $145,000 (\u00a3112,514) after making unscientific claims about the health benefits of vaginal eggs.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Goop and Mann for comment.", "description": "A geneticist and obesity expert at the University of Cambridge has criticised Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s lifestyle brand, Goop, over an article on its website that advises readers to strive towards their \u201cleanest liveable weight\u201d.", "authors": ["Olivia Petter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/10/gpyeo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
