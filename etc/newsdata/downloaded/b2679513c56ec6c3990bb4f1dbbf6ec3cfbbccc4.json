The detailed stories on Weinstein published by The New York Times and New Yorker in 2017 shared a Pulitzer Prize and are credited with igniting the #MeToo movement.\n\n\u201cFor six months, the only support I\u2019d had was (NBC News President) Noah Oppenheim scrunching his nose and holding journalism at arm\u2019s length, afraid it might get on him,\u201d Farrow wrote.\n\nHis former employers call Farrow\u2019s book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d a smear. It\u2019s being published Tuesday.\n\nNBC remains adamant that its hand was forced by Farrow\u2019s enthusiasm for a story that - at the time he was working there - didn\u2019t meet its standards.\n\n\u201cFarrow\u2019s effort to defame NBC News is clearly motivated not by a pursuit of truth, but an axe to grind,\u201d NBC News President Noah Oppenheim wrote in a detailed memo to NBC News staff on Monday. \u201cIt is built on a series of distortions, confused timelines and outright inaccuracies.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, the reasons why NBC let Farrow and his explosive reporting leave are murky. Farrow suggests fear of Weinstein, fear of having Matt Lauer\u2019s secrets exposed, journalistic timidity or simple misjudgment all may play a role. Farrow\u2019s former producer, Rich McHugh, wrote in Vanity Fair that NBC abdicated its responsibility to relentlessly pursue and tell the truth.\n\nOne thing they do agree on: it was Oppenheim\u2019s idea in the first place, when he pointed out a tweet by actress Rose McGowan about being abused by an unnamed figure in the movie business.\n\nFarrow, a former MSNBC host who segued into investigative journalism at NBC, scored an interview with McGowan, where she told her story but didn\u2019t name Weinstein on camera. Off-camera, she said it was him (Weinstein, who faces a sexual assault trial in New York in January regarding allegations not relating to McGowan, has denied any criminal wrongdoing). Farrow and McHugh pursued other sources and, they soon learned, so was the Times.\n\nYet he wrote about hurdles placed in his way that made him question NBC\u2019s desire to do the story.\n\nFarrow wrote of doubts by Oppenheim that Weinstein was a figure many viewers knew or even cared about. When he told a supervisor that the Times was also onto a story, that person said that sometimes it was better to let someone else go first. He and McHugh were told lawyers were worried about whether NBC could get in trouble for talking to victims who had signed non-disclosure agreements, and of a concern that Farrow might be accused of a conflict of interest because his estranged father, Woody Allen, was once in business with Weinstein.\n\nHe and his producer were told at least a dozen times to pause or stop reporting, he wrote.\n\nEventually, the reporting team said they kept working on the story despite a lack of enthusiasm from above, with McHugh quickly switching a side screen on his computer to hide what he was doing when a supervisor was near.\n\nNBC said Farrow mischaracterized conversations; that Oppenheim wondered not about the story\u2019s importance but about the news value of one element that had been reported on before - an audio tape from a woman fending off Weinstein. NBC wasn\u2019t satisfied coming in second but had noted if one victim came forward elsewhere it might open a floodgate of others who followed.\n\nAs the story moved along, NBC said it asked Farrow to prepare a script and assigned some of its top producers to vet the material.\n\nThe verdict was unanimous: Farrow needed more proof to sustain the claim that Weinstein was a sexual predator, Oppenheim said in an interview on Monday.\n\n\u201cHe refused to accept that decision,\u201d Oppenheim said. \u201cHe was frustrated by the standards we were upholding.\u201d\n\nThe book details aggressive efforts by Weinstein to stop the story through the use of lawyers, public relations experts and a shadowy security firm, along with multiple calls to NBC executives.\n\nAfter word got out that Farrow had left NBC, he reports that the mogul bragged to others that he got the network to \u201ckill\u201d the story. Weinstein even sent Oppenheim a bottle of expensive vodka (which NBC said he gave away because he doesn\u2019t drink).\n\nWeinstein played no role in NBC\u2019s decision to hold off on what Farrow had reported, Oppenheim said.\n\nA more sinister theory for NBC\u2019s inaction revolved around Matt Lauer, the \u201cToday\u201d show host who was fired in November 2017 for \u201cinappropriate sexual contact\u201d with a fellow employee. That colleague told Farrow that Lauer raped her in a Sochi hotel room in 2014; Lauer described the sex as consensual.\n\nFarrow wrote that Weinstein \u201chad made it known to the network that he was aware of Lauer\u2019s behavior and was capable of revealing it.\u201d At the time, Lauer was NBC News\u2018 highest-paid news employee, a fixture on the morning show.\n\nBut NBC denies Farrow\u2019s claim that its executives were aware, or should have been aware, that Lauer had a sexual misconduct problem.\n\nOnly one person from NBC\u2019s hierarchy approached him after the New Yorker piece ran to express regrets about what had happened, Farrow wrote. It was Brian Roberts, chairman of NBC\u2019s parent company Comcast.\n\nThe bad blood between Farrow and NBC News has led to a laundry list of he said-he said claims. They don\u2019t even agree on whose idea it was to take the reporting elsewhere.\n\nThat is, ultimately, the decision that most befuddled people who weren\u2019t directly involved. If the story wasn\u2019t ready, why didn\u2019t NBC just let Farrow and McHugh keep working on it?\n\nOppenheim said NBC agreed to let him leave because their working relationship had irretrievably broken down.\n\nFarrow \u201chas refused to even consider the possibility that (NBC employees) were all acting with integrity and good faith and has instead chosen to pursue this conspiracy theory that is completely unfounded,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In reporter Ronan Farrow's account of his contentious divorce from NBC News, the more evidence he gathered on Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct, the less enthusiastic his bosses seemed to be.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Bauder"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/media_nbc_vs_farrow_34003_c0-181-3000-1931_s1200x700.jpg?2e619609c60cbd18bb9bd9e76e66e41b3bd0dab9", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
