The attack on Saudi Arabian oil sites on Sept. 14 that destroyed 5% of the world\u2019s supply sent oil stocks to the highest they\u2019d been in more than a decade.\n\nAs some investors worry, one analyst is confident that oil and energy are a safe place to invest.\n\n\u201cA lot of stocks in the energy sector set up very well in an environment where we still see global demand rising over the next several decades,\u201d said Rob Thummel, managing director and senior portfolio manager at Tortoise, on \u201cThe First Trade\u201d this morning. \u201cIf you look at the energy sector relative to other sectors in the S&P 500, the energy sector offers a yield that's probably one-and-a-half times the broad S&P 500,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe enterprise-value-to-EBITDA are cash-flow multiples that a lot of investors look at to value sectors across the entire S&P 500. The energy sectors\u2019 enterprise-value-to-EBITDA multiple is basically half the broader market,\u201d said Thummel.\n\nWorkers are seen at the damaged site of Saudi Aramco oil facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia, September 20, 2019. REUTERS/Hamad l Mohammed More\n\nInvestors concerns\u2019 about increasing global energy demand, the collapse of oil prices and natural gas prices, and commodity prices isn\u2019t putting off Thummel.\n\n\u201cThis is a really good opportunity to be buying energy stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cEnergy is essential globally. You need energy to basically do anything \u2013 to drive our cars, to heat our homes, to cool our homes. And where does that energy come from? It comes from oil. It comes from natural gas. It comes from a little bit of coal. It comes from renewables, as well.\u201d\n\nBecause energy is so essential, \u201cinvestors want to have a piece of that in their portfolios,\u201d he said.\n\nRight now, the two biggest factors affecting oil are the Saudi Arabia attacks, and the U.S.-China trade war. \u201cIt's a good time to just be gradually dollar-cost averaging into the energy sector over time,\u201d Thummel said. \u201cAnd if and when this trade war ends, you'll see a boost in global energy demand, we think, going forward.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn,YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Because energy is so essential globally, investors should have it in their portfolios, says portfolio manager Rob Thummel.", "authors": ["Jennifer Shanker", "Production Assistant"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qaRnmbCCfKEeaxR7KsiYpg--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/92b73bc0-de2c-11e9-bdaf-57f785cdf30f", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
