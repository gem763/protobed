[September 2].\n\nLisa said: \"He'd gone to stay at his nana's in York for the week after we got back from holiday.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"When I went to pick him up all the black had come off in the shower the night before and left the red mark behind.\n\n\"I took him to A&E that night after ringing 111 because I Googled it and read all these horror stories.\n\n\"There a doctor bandaged it and said it would need re-dressing and two days later in Manchester we saw a burns doctor who was really good.\n\n\"He said he didn't think it would scar and put a special burn cream on it and dressed it again.\"\n\nDuring a routine check-up a week later staff discovered a red rash had erupted on Charlie's arm showing that it had become infected [September 9].\n\nCharlie was prescribed a five-day course of antibiotics and has an appointment in six week's time to see a scar specialist.\n\nLisa said that doctors reassured her that given his age, they're hopeful that Charlie's arm will fully heal and he won't be left with any scarring.\n\nLisa said: \"He was taking his antibiotics four times a day for five days and when we last went back they were happy with how it was healing.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"I just have to wash it three times a day with unperfumed soap and then put some cream on it, we have an appointment with the scar doctor in six weeks.\n\n\"The burns doctor said he didn't think it would scar and the nurse said as he has youth on his side they do generally heal quite well.\n\n\"They said it could take months for it to go fully but there's always the possibility of it leaving that imprint.\n\n\"It's looking really good at the minute so I'm hopeful it wont scar.\"\n\nLisa is now urging parents not to allow their children to have black henna tattoos done so that others don't go through what Charlie has.\n\nLisa said: \"It didn't ruin Charlie's holiday because this happened at the end of it but I felt it was my fault.\n\n\"Before this happened I'd never heard of it, I don't want anyone else to go through what he has.\n\n\"To any parents thinking about letting their children get these black henna tattoos I would advise, just say no.\n\n\"Get it up on the internet and show any kids who are asking to have it done plenty of images on Google that would definitely put kids off wanting it.\n\n\"My advice would be to stick to your word and say 'no', whether they have a strop or not, it's just not worth it.\"", "description": "Charlie Gaughan got the temporary inking the night before flying home from Spain, before the pigment started flaking off and the schoolboy was left with a painful-looking burn that became infected", "authors": ["Helen Le Caplain", "Image", "Kennedy News", "Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20546409.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Kennedy-News-and-Media.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
