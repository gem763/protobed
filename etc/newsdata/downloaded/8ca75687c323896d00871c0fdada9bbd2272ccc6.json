But let\u2019s follow the former vice-president\u2019s lead, and put this matter in perspective.\n\nIn 2018, Canada spent roughly 11 percent of its GDP on health care. Under its single-payer insurance model, that investment was enough to provide every Canadian with premium, free access to the world\u2019s 14th-highest-performing health-care system.\n\nThat same year, the United States spent 18 percent of its GDP on health care \u2014 which, under our system, was inadequate to provide any form of insurance to nearly 30 million Americans, nor to prevent 50 percent of our people from delaying or forgoing medical care due to affordability concerns. For these reasons, among others, America\u2019s exorbitant investment in its medical sector has bought us the world\u2019s 29th-ranked health-care system. That places the wealthiest country in human history just behind the Czech Republic on the small matter of caring for its ill.\n\nUnlike Canadian citizens, Americans do not have to pay taxes to support a universal public insurance system. But that 18 percent of GDP doesn\u2019t come from nowhere. The vast majority of U.S. adults see health insurance as a mandatory expense. As a practical matter, their private insurance premiums function as de facto taxes \u2014 obligatory payments deducted from their paychecks to finance a form of social protection. As a legal matter, meanwhile, U.S. federal law still mandates that all Americans secure insurance coverage (although the penalty for not doing so has been set to zero). Thus, in both an essential and technical sense, the typical American worker is compelled by government policy to fork over a hefty percentage of their wages to private insurers.\n\nIf Biden acknowledged this reality \u2014 which is to say, if he ignored the superficial distinction between payroll taxes and premium payments \u2014 he would find (presumably, to his horror) that the U.S. already taxes labor income at one of the highest rates of any country in the OECD. As Matt Bruenig of the People\u2019s Policy Project has shown, the \u201ccompulsory payment rate\u201d for a married U.S. worker with two kids was 43.2 percent in 2017; for an analogous Canadian, that rate was 11.5 percent.\n\nNo honest observer can look at this data and conclude that single-payer health-care systems are inherently more expensive and inefficient than America\u2019s existing model. Which means that the eye-popping price tag of Bernie Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All plan does not reflect the steep price of socialized medicine, per se. Rather, it reflects the fact that America\u2019s aberrant refusal to impose price controls on its health-care industry has enabled the sector to extract an ever-higher share of national income. Americans spend several times more than their peers in other developed countries on health-care administration, pharmaceuticals, and physicians\u2019 salaries. Although the existing Medicare for All proposals would create some cost savings, they would not fully rectify our overspending problem in the near term. This is, in part, because bringing our payment rates all the way down to the international median in one fell swoop would risk hospital closures and other economic disruptions (and spur massive resistance from powerful and respected interest groups). For these reasons, any plausible proposal for shifting all of America\u2019s health-care costs onto Uncle Sam\u2019s books is bound to look fiscally extravagant. But leaving those costs off the government\u2019s ledger doesn\u2019t make them disappear.\n\nSource:: Source: Harvard T.H.

Which is to say, establishing single-payer would save us $2 trillion in national income, while guaranteeing all Americans affordable health care. But it would also require U.S. workers to make compulsory social insurance payments to the government rather than to private insurers.\n\nAnd for Joe Biden, that\u2019s apparently a deal-breaker.\n\nAt this week\u2019s debate in Ohio, Biden and other moderate Democrats hammered Elizabeth Warren for refusing to state explicitly that her Medicare for All plan would require raising taxes on the middle class. The Massachusetts senator did not deny that her proposal would involve such tax hikes. But she refused to utter the T-word. Instead, she merely promised that she would never sign a health-care bill that didn\u2019t lower the middle-class\u2019s overall costs.\n\nIt was more than fair for the debate moderators to press Warren on her evasiveness. Journalists should always work to expose the trade-offs inherent in politicians\u2019 proposals. But Warren\u2019s caginess was rooted in the media\u2019s failure to apply such scrutiny universally. Democrats campaigning on plans that would retain America\u2019s redundant insurance bureaucracies were not asked how they could justify such an extravagance. Under the norms of mainstream political journalism, costs imposed on the American people by the private sector require no justification or defense; only costs imposed by the public sector do. If you are committed to abetting the meteoric rise of private health-insurance premiums, a debate moderator will not ask you to level with the American people about how much your approach to health-care policy will cost them. If you are committed to reducing overall health-care costs by expanding the public sector\u2019s role in medical provision, you will be ritually scolded for the extraordinary (and extraordinarily decontextualized) fiscal price of your program.\n\nAs the party that favors higher levels of taxation and public provision, Democrats have an interest in contesting this norm. Biden\u2019s agenda may be less ambitious than Sanders or Warren\u2019s. But he still (officially) aims to raise taxes and increase spending by trillions of dollars. A political discourse that treats taxation as presumptively suspect (even as it treats private rentierism as presumptively legitimate) will not be a favorable one for any Democratic president. Amy Klobuchar, who criticized Warren for her secret middle-class tax hike Tuesday night, is a co-sponsor of the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, which would finance an entitlement to paid family leave with a small increase in payroll taxes. When the Klobuchar administration pushes for that law\u2019s passage, it will want its policy to be judged on the basis of its impact on the median family\u2019s overall costs, not their overall tax bill. And yet, in attacking single-payer Tuesday night, Klobuchar implicitly endorsed the opposite criterion. Equating support for middle-class families with opposition to increasing their tax rates is a conservative project. There is no reason for any Democratic candidate to be advancing it \u2014 no matter their position on single-payer.\n\nThere are arguments against the existing Medicare for All proposals that do not involve demonizing the very concept of tax-financed social programs. Some of these are logistical (Sanders has neglected to detail various aspects of his transition plan). The most compelling, though, is purely political. At present, there are 14 votes in the U.S. Senate for Bernie\u2019s single-payer bill. In the best-case scenario, Jon Tester will be the pivotal vote in the upper chamber in 2021. Given these facts, there is little basis for believing that Medicare for All will be legislatively viable in the medium-term future, no matter who wins the 2020 election. After all, six-year terms, sky-high renomination rates, and an avalanche of industry cash will insulate anti-single-payer Senate Democrats incumbents against popular pressure in support of the proposal.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no guarantee that popular pressure would be forthcoming. The vast majority of available polling indicates that a public option is much more popular with voters than single-payer. One can reasonably attribute this result to the aforementioned biases in our political discourse. But no Democratic nominee will be able to eradicate those biases next summer.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy The Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nPhoto: Courtesy The Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nIf Medicare for All is not legislatively viable and a public option is more electorally expedient, then there is a case for the Democratic nominee to campaign on the latter. After all, the stakes of denying Donald Trump a second term are extremely high. How one calculates the potential electoral cost of running on a somewhat less popular health-care policy \u2014 let alone how one weighs that cost against the potential long-term benefits of popularizing single-payer (a more efficient and just mode of health-care provision) \u2014 is inescapably subjective. But given the balance of forces in the Senate, deferring to public opinion on health care so as to maximize the probability of Trump\u2019s eviction from the White House next year, strikes me as a choice a genuinely progressive politician could make.\n\nThere is no electoral argument, however, for engaging in anti-tax demagoguery. Biden could emulate his old boss and endorse single-payer in principle, but insist that the country is not yet ready for it. Or he could steal Mayor Pete\u2019s line, and say that he trusts the American people to eventually discover the superiority of publicly provided insurance, once they\u2019re given the option. Instead, he\u2019s opted for a needlessly reactionary mode of attack that will damage Warren or Sanders electorally, should they win the nomination, and undermine any future Democratic president legislatively, should the party regain the chance to govern.", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s attacks on Medicare For All don\u2019t just hurt the cause of universal health care \u2013 they demonize the very concept of tax-financed social programs.
