While pharmaceutical companies share the blame, the opioid crisis was also the result of bad government policy, a porous southern border, and improper medical guidance.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) claimed at the fourth Democrat debate on Tuesday evening that the opioid crisis was the result of \u201cunfettered capitalism,\u201d and that the only answer was a \u201cpolitical revolution.\u201d\n\nOther Democratic candidates made similar statements, with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) casting pharmaceutical companies as the villains. Even businessman Andrew Yang piled on, calling the opioid crisis \u201c\u201dcapitalism run amok\u201d (which has not stopped him from taking campaign donations from employees of pharmaceutical companies, according to OpenSecrets.org).\n\nPharmaceutical companies certainly share the blame, and some are now agreeing to pay billions of dollars in fines.\n\nHowever, there are other important causes of the opioid epidemic:\n\n1. Government regulatory failure. As HuffPost noted in 2017, the opioid crisis was partly created by government policy \u2014 starting with President Bill Clinton. HuffPost recalled: \u201cIn 1997, at the start of Bill Clinton\u2019s second term, his FDA relaxed its rules to allow specific-drug-for-specific-ailment claims. Clinton\u2019s oversight of the industry was so lax that Purdue was promoting OxyContin on giveaway swag like beach hats, coffee mugs, and fanny packs, a marketing scheme that didn\u2019t cease until Purdue was fined over it in 2007 following consumer lawsuits.\u201d Later, even as Americans were drying, President Barack Obama failed to declare a public health emergency for fentanyl.\n\n2. A porous southern border. The absence of border security along the frontier with Mexico allowed illegal drugs to be smuggled into the United States in massive quantities. Mexican drug cartels thrived, developing networks deep into the heartland of America, often exploiting connections within the growing illegal alien population.\n\n3. Improper medical guidance. As strange as it may seem today, the conventional medical wisdom two decades ago was that doctors were prescribing too few painkillers, not too many. The National Institutes of Health called pain published articles with titles such as, \u201cThe undertreatment of pain.\u201d Some physicians described pain medication as a \u201chuman right.\u201d In the mid-1990s, the American Pain Society focused on \u201craising awareness that patients with pain were undertreated.\u201d The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, a non-profit that is responsible for certifying hospitals in many states to receive Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, called pain management a \u201cright\u201d for patients as late as 2001. Many doctors reacted accordingly by prescribing more opioids.\n\nArguably, government failure, not \u201cunfettered capitalism,\u201d led to the opioid epidemic. In fact, doctors who followed the best government guidance might have over-prescribed opioids, believing \u2014 because they had been told as much \u2014 that they were doing the best thing for patients.\n\nNotably, President Donald Trump has led a successful fight against opioid addiction nationwide. For the first time in 30 years, deaths from addiction have begun to decline \u2014 and border security is finally a top government priority.\n\nJoel B.
