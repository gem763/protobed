Crosthwaite, Altria\u2019s chief strategy officer. The company cited the need to focus on regulatory matters for its decision to tap Mr. Crosthwaite, who has experience working closely with regulators.\"\n\nAccordingly, \"Juul said it wouldn\u2019t lobby against the Trump administration\u2019s proposed ban on most flavored e-cigarettes and will suspend all broadcast, print and digital advertising for its products in the U.S.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker called for a four-month ban on all e-cigarette and vaping products sold in the commonwealth due to a nationwide outbreak of a lung illness and even deaths supposedly caused by vapes and e-cigarettes.\n\nCritics point out that it is not the vapes nor the e-cigarettes which actually cause these tragedies, rather it is individuals using certain types of THC in the vapes instead of nicotine.\n\nAt the national level, \"the Trump administration earlier this month said it planned to ban all e-cigarettes except those formulated to taste like tobacco. The banned flavors, including mint and menthol, represent more than 80% of Juul\u2019s sales,\" the WSJ notes.\n\nThe company's sales dipped in August by more than $14 million after hundreds of Juul-related medical cases propped up around the United States.", "description": ".09/25/2019 21:25:12PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/229/57e7ae58-8d3c-4efa-b0da-214c9a3be83a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
