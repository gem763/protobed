I just can\u2019t believe I fell for it.\n\nThe Brexit protest message which has been ploughed in 40metre high letters in a Wiltshire field (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018Manipulated wasn\u2019t I, well and truly. I wonder how many more? People say to me, about 17.4 million people voted for this and that\u2019s what they want.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m one of those 17.4 million and that is not what I want, that is not what I voted for. I want my vote back. I\u2019ve had my vote stolen and I want it back.\u2019\n\nDavid Lewis of Manor Farm, Water Eaton, Swindon, where the protest message has been ploughed, said: \u2018Brexit would be just awful for farming.\n\n\u2018So many farmers voted Leave but have since realised they were had. It gives me real pride to see this huge message ploughed out in our field. I hope the people in London get to see it. This country has changed its mind.\u2019\n\nIn December last year Led by Donkeys was formed by four current or past Greenpeace members \u2013 James Sadri, Oliver Knowles, Will Rose and Ben Stewart \u2013 to protest against Brexit.\n\nThe message was created by Led by Donkeys ahead of the crucial Brexit vote in the House of Commons (Picture: Led by Donkeys)\n\nThe group started posting billboard advertisement featuring recent statements from politicians which undermined their current stance.\n\nMr Knowles, one of the founders, claims that a YouGov analysis of 300 polls shows a majority of Britons would now vote to stay in the European Union.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe name Led by Donkeys is a play on a famous phrase \u2018lions led by donkeys\u2019 used by a German general Erich Ludendorff to highlight the bravery of British soldiers and officers in the First World War but the incompetency of its generals.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
