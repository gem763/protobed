They feel they have the license to say whatever they want. Feels to me like living in some kind of 'Alice in Wonderland' where you're up on the real world, then you fall down the rabbit hole and the president is the Cheshire cat asking you questions about crazy things that don't have any resemblance to the reality of anything that has to do with me,\u201d he told ABC News\u2019 Amy Robach.\n\nBiden repeated his father\u2019s assertions that the two never discussed Hunter\u2019s foreign business interests, even as he sat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while the then-vice president was a U.S. point person on Ukraine policy. He also defended his seat on the board of a China-based investment firm from which he resigned over the weekend.\n\nAs his father has remained a front-runner in the Democratic presidential field, Biden\u2019s business dealings have been the target of unfounded attacks by conservatives and the president, who accuse the former vice president of forcing out a Ukrainian prosecutor who was said to have been investigating an oligarch linked to Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian energy company whose board Hunter sat on.\n\nThat investigation was dormant at the time and did not involve any potential wrongdoing by Biden. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s ouster was widely backed by the international community and even Republicans in Congress at the time. Biden stepped down from Burisma in April.\n\nBut Trump, with the help of his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, has set to cast both roles as signs of corruption, and Trump's request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this summer that he investigate the Bidens has landed him in a political maelstrom threatening his presidency.\n\nWhile Biden acknowledged that it was highly likely his last name played some role in his getting both jobs, he rejected the contention by critics that he was unqualified to fill the posts, listing off a number of other boards he\u2019d sat on and arguing that, despite a lack of Ukraine- or natural gas-specific experience, \"I think I had as much knowledge as anybody else on the board, if not more.\"\n\nAsked to respond to the president\u2019s false claims that he received $1.5 billion from the Chinese government as part of his work for that firm, Biden buried his face in his hands.\n\n\u201cLook, this is \u2014 literally has no basis in fact. In any way,\u201d he said, later adding: \u201cNo one ever paid me $1.5 billion, and if they had, I would not be doing this interview right now.\u201d\n\nHe also bristled at a question from Robach about his $50,000-a-month salary at Burisma, which critics have pointed to as evidence he was unfairly profiting from his father\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cLook, I'm a private citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I don't have to do is sit here and open my kimono as to how it relates to how much money I make ... or didn't, but it's all been reported.\u201d\n\nHe also said he has no regrets about joining Burisma, except that he hadn't have the foresight to recognize the potential political fallout of the move.\n\n\"I regret not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the United States that would be listening to this ridiculous conspiracy idea, which has again been completely debunked by everyone,\" he said.\n\nPressed by Robach about whether he should have anticipated the blowback, Biden got more defensive.\n\n\"You know what, I\u2019m a human, and you know what, did I make a mistake?\" he said. \"Well, maybe, in the grand scheme of things. But did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.\"\n\nStill, Biden reaffirmed his pledge to not work for any foreign entities if his father wins the White House next year.", "description": "Hunter Biden has forcefully pushed back on accusations that he or his father, former Vice President Joe Biden, did anything improper when it came to his business dealings in Ukraine and China, but in an interview Tuesday he conceded he used \"poor judgment\" in joining foreign companies while", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4aBDHMKI9QdawaY2WIxeWA--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/c225a31e38b6848cdb0f92592dc016c4", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
