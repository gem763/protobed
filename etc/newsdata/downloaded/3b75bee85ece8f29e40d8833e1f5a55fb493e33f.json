We will invest in our brands and in our capabilities. We will regain the glory of our past, and we will create a brighter future for the Molson Coors Beverage Company.\u201d\n\nThe company, which will be renamed Molson Coors Beverage Co. effective Jan. 1, is consolidating from four business units to two, according to the blog post.\n\nIt plans to put more money behind emerging brands such as Saint Archer Gold, Blue Moon Light Sky, Cape Line and Arnold Palmer Spiked in the U.S., and Coors Slice in Canada.", "description": "The CEO of Molson Coors said Wednesday that the company will undergo a massive restructuring across North America, which will result in the loss of hundreds of jobs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/gettyimages-953885086_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
