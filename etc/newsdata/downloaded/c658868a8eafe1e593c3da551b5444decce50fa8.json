The so-called Saddleridge fire, which started in Sylmar, had consumed more than 4,600 acres by 3am local time Friday, fire officials said.\n\nOfficials said a middle-aged man died near where the fire was burning after he went into cardiac arrest and that a firefighter suffered an eye injury. Authorities ordered mandatory evacuations in the Granada Hills, Porter Ranch and Oakridge Estates neighborhoods. Several homes were seen burning in Granada Hills, and the Los Angeles fire department said an \u201cunknown number\u201d of homes were potentially threatened.\n\nA blaze also ripped through a mobile home park in Calimesa, a city about 65 miles (104km) east of Los Angeles, destroying dozens of residences. The fire started when trash being hauled caught fire and the driver dumped the load beside a road, according to Riverside county officials. An 89-year-old woman, Lois Arvickson, is missing, according to her son.\n\nIn northern California, the utility company PG&E started the process of restoring power to some of the communities that were cut off on Wednesday and Thursday. PG&E had shut off power to an estimated 2 million people in northern California over fears its equipment could spark wildfires amid high winds.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Firefighters try to protect surrounding homes as they battle the Sandalwood fire in Calimesa, California, on 10 October. Photograph: Jennifer Cappuccio Maher/AP\n\nCalifornia\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, criticized PG&E on Thursday, and customers complained about the inconveniences caused by the unprecedented blackouts that began midweek.\n\nNewsom told reporters PG&E\u2019s decision to cut power should not be blamed on the climate crisis. Instead, he said he believed the blackouts were the result of mismanagement, \u201cgreed and neglect\u201d by the nation\u2019s largest investor-owned utility.\n\n\u201cWhat has occurred in the last 48 hours is unacceptable,\u201d Newsom said, listing problems such as school closures and people who \u201ccan\u2019t even access water or medical supplies\u201d.\n\n\u201cNorthern California is not a third world country,\u201d the San Jose Mercury Statesman said in an editorial. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that the region is being forced to endure this level of disruption as the long-term strategy for dealing with the threat of wildfires.\u201d\n\nPG&E suggested it was already seeing the wisdom of its decision borne out as gusts topping 77mph (122km/h) raked the San Francisco Bay Area amid a bout of dry, windy weather.\n\n\u201cWe have found multiple cases of damage or hazards\u201d caused by heavy winds, including fallen branches that came in contact with overhead lines, said Sumeet Singh, a vice-president for the utility. \u201cIf they were energized, they could\u2019ve ignited.\u201d\n\nPG&E began practicing preventive shutoffs this year during red flag fire weather conditions \u2013 high winds and low humidity \u2013 after investigators found it at fault in two of the deadliest wildfires in California\u2019s history, both within the past two years.\n\nSome of the wildfires started because of trees falling on power lines \u2013 trees that should have been cleared by PG&E because of their proximity to the lines. In the 2018 Camp fire, the utility\u2019s outdated infrastructure was implicated. The Camp fire, which killed 85 and virtually incinerated the town of Paradise, was blamed on PG&E transmission lines.\n\nPG&E\u2019s CEO, Bill Johnson, promised the utility will \u201cdo better\u201d when it comes to communicating with customers during future shutoffs. It was unacceptable that its websites crashed, maps were inconsistent and call centers were overloaded, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cWe were not adequately prepared,\u201d he said.\n\nFaced with customer anger, PG&E put up barricades around its San Francisco headquarters. A customer threw eggs at a PG&E office in Oroville. And a PG&E truck was hit by a bullet, though authorities could not immediately say whether it was targeted.", "description": "Saddleridge fire, which started in Sylmar, consumed more than 4,600 acres by 3am Friday, officials said", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e364b169e921b4ccb2a8766e9bea2b99a97a0db/0_140_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=acf11da8373f95d222191daeb9a0ee14", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
