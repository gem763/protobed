As the 17-year-old says now: \"A football pitch, hockey pitch, any sport.\"\n\nHer childhood club, Triton HC, was handed a new pitch last month at a former Manchester Metropolitan University campus which had been under threat to housing. As part of the sale, the developer committed to building a facility which included a hockey astroturf. Triton had to play on their old battered pitch a short walk away for several years to demonstrate the need for a replacement.\n\nGoodman, meanwhile, has faced setbacks on the pitch. Starting out as an 11-year-old when she went to watch her sister whose team found themselves a player short, she was later banned from playing in the Cheshire League for a year as she was too young. Two seasons later she was voted, aged 14, the league's player of the year.\n\nAround the same time, the boys were getting bigger at the local rugby club she had been at for six years. \"They said I couldn\u2019t play with them anymore because of the physicality,\" admitted Goodman, who played in Bowdon's 2-0 defeat at Surbiton on Saturday. \"I knew I would be a sporty person, that I would have that one sport I could be good at or love when I was older.\"", "description": "When Maddie Goodman, the Bowdon Hightown forward, moved from Banbury to Cheshire as a young girl, her parents were intent on finding her a pitch to play on and keep active in sport.", "authors": ["Rod", "Keith Hackett", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/hockey/2019/10/14/Maddie-Goodman-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7GqPXFONHKpaUmyaB--D9GI.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
