All the allegations are false.'\n\nAs she sat next to her friend Jeannie Lorin, who runs the Beauty Society salon, Miss Arcuri added: 'It's such a shame to see successful businesswomen, or just businesswomen in general, be persecuted.'\n\nShe added: 'One of the things I've been surprised with is how much support there has been for me, despite these allegations, because women see through these attacks and they know the narrative.'\n\nAfter avoiding the spotlight for a week, she was seen for the first time in a beauty salon run by a friend which is close to her Los Angeles home. Miss Arcuri has said that all grants and places on trade missions she received were fairly awarded\n\nFriends said she had been lying low with extended family elsewhere in the US while deciding how to respond to the clamour.\n\nThere are four inquiries into whether father-of-five Mr Johnson broke rules by doing favours for Miss Arcuri and her tech firms.\n\nMiss Arcuri moved to California last year with British partner Matthew Hickey and their young daughter.\n\nJennifer Arcuri was pictured Boris Johnson on his mayoral campaign in 2012 and has been lying low\n\nBetween 2012 and 2015 she was 'very close' to Mr Johnson, who would visit her Shoreditch flat \u2013 which had a dancing pole\u2013 for private 'technology lessons'.\n\nLast night a friend said: 'She is still deciding how best to get her side of the story across.\n\n'She is an astute and serious businesswoman and knows she needs to regain control of this situation.'\n\nThe pole-dancing American tech entrepreneur was previously photographed draped in a Union Jack\n\nAnd Mr Johnson could be forced to hand over text messages and emails he sent to the businesswoman or face prison.\n\nIf the leader fails to respond to the summons, he could be handed a sentence of up to three months in prison.\n\nMs Arcuri was said to have been a 27-year-old student at the time of applying for the \u00a3100,000 a year job.\n\nIn an email leaked to The Sunday Times, she allegedly later wrote: 'I still have the letter of rec from Boris. hahaha. To think that we asked him to write us a recommendation for the CEO of Tech City is just hysterical.'\n\nBoris Johnson could be forced to hand over text messages and emails he sent American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri or face prison\n\nShe listed 'Boris Johnson, Mayor of London' as a reference on the application, according to the paper.\n\nOn Twitter Sunday Times reporter Gabriel Pogrund posted: 'A little morsel that didn't make it into the paper.\n\n'From 2012 - 2014, Jennifer Arcuri used the following email signature to sign off correspondence with friends, MPs and trade officials: 'Sent from the most awesome iPad in the world!'\n\nMiss Arcuri out shopping in Los Angeles last week. When asked if Boris Johnson had contacted her since the scandal emerged she said: 'No. Can you blame him?'\n\nLast month, Mr Johnson was referred to the police complaints body to assess whether he should face a criminal investigation over his association with the businesswoman.\n\nIt follows reports by the same paper that Ms Arcuri was given \u00a3126,000 in public money and privileged access to three foreign trade missions led by Mr Johnson while he was mayor.\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror this week Ms Arcuri furiously denied claims that she had a sexual relationship with Mr Johnson and branded rumours 'complete b*******'.\n\nShe added: 'They fall in love with me in about ten minutes\u2026 because I know what to say. I make men trip over their d****'.\n\nWhen asked if Boris Johnson had contacted her since the scandal emerged she said: 'No. Can you blame him?'", "description": "Boris Johnson's 'tech advisor' American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri will appear on Good Morning Britain tomorrow to break her silence amid a storm over her relationship with the Prime Minister.", "authors": ["Emily Webber For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/14/19362064-0-image-a-71_1570368841224.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
