The then-Category 2 storm hit the state's coast the hardest. But in preparations for the storm, conservationists were hunkering down, trying to protect baby sea turtles and nests from the storm conditions along the coast.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot of sea turtles found by the general public,\" Jennifer Winters, Volusia County's sea turtle habitat conservation plan manager, told the Orlando Sentinel. \"There's not a lot we can do. Most likely once the eggs get pulled out of the sand, they're not going to be viable \u2014 they're not going to make it.\" 90% of the US' loggerhead sea turtle population lives in Florida On Friday, there were 397 sea turtle nests in beaches in Volusia County \u2014 but at least 40 nests have washed out since, Winters told the Sentinel. Winters expected that more would be lost in the storm. So far this season, 1,000 sea turtle nests have been counted in Volusia County, exceeding 2012's record of 919 nests, the Sentinel reported. And it's not just Volusia County county having a banner year for turtles.\n\nAbout 90% of the US' loggerhead sea turtle population lives in Florida, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. According to the FWC, these turtles mainly nest on Florida's east coast.\n\nRead more: Hurricane categories tell only part of the story \u2014 here's the real damage storms like Dorian can do\n\nAhead of Dorian, some groups went to great lengths to protect the baby turtles and nest eggs. For example, the Loggerhead Marinelife Center in, Juno Beach, Florida, detailed its efforts in a series of Facebook posts.\n\nOn Sunday, the turtles were dry-docked and secured ahead of the storm.\n\n\"Over the past few days, beachgoers have brought additional hatchlings to the center, which makes our count at 20 hatchlings total,\" the post said. \"All hatchlings and sea turtle patients are safe thanks to our dedicated volunteers and staff who've helped prepare the center and turtles for the hurricane over the past few days.\"\n\nThe efforts continued throughout the week. On Tuesday, when the storm made its way up the Florida coast, the center provided continued updates. The Center issued a warning against visiting beaches in partnership with the FWC. The group also said its best to use caution when approaching \u2014 and rescuing \u2014 hatchlings.\n\nAs far as eggs go, they say it's best to leave the uncovered ones alone even if \"it's hard to see.\"\n\nThe post said: \"Please do not touch the eggs, leave them in place. Usually, once eggs are exposed, they are not viable, but have the best chance of survival if left untouched.\"\n\nApproximately 18% of total sea turtle nests were affected\n\nAfter the storm, the LMC and FWC went out to do recon on a 9.5 mile stretch of beach. They found things were better than expected. Prior to the storm, there were 20,952 sea turtle nests on the beach, and the LMC estimates that 3,793 were affected by the storm, according to a press release reviewed by Insider.\n\nEven with an 18% loss of nests, that would still mean there are over 17,000 net nests for the 2019 nesting season, which will end on October 31. That's an overall increase from the 2018 season, which saw 11,951 total sea turtle nests.\n\nThe press release also said that most broken shells that were visible on the beach were not damaged during Dorian but were, instead, from hatched turtles.\n\nIn the press release, LMC reminded beach goers that exposed sea turtle eggs should not be untouched, as most exposed eggs are not viable. The LMC also said that if an exposed nest is found, beach goers should contact the FWC and not touch the ggs. Additionally, any found hatchlings that appear \"disoriented\" can be brought to the LMC and left in the designated hatchling cooler.", "description": "Loggerhead Marinelife Center went to lengths to keep baby sea turtle nests safe as Hurricane Dorian rolled in.", "authors": ["Susanna Heller"], "top_image": "https://static.businessinsider.com/image/5d72d08521214c70fb3084dc-750.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
