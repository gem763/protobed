The information in question? Your email address or phone number \u2014 whichever you used for two-factor authentication or security purposes.\n\nThe error apparently stemmed from Twitter\u2019s Tailored Audiences advertising program. This would basically allow advertisers to match customers with appropriate ads by tallying their own list of email addresses and phone numbers with ones the user has provided to Twitter.\n\nExcept those details weren\u2019t provided to Twitter for the purposes of advertising or even identification. They were provided to help protect users\u2019 accounts one way or another. Twitter admitted it didn\u2019t know exactly how many were impacted by this, but the issue was fixed as of September, adding, \u201cThis was an error and we apologize.\u201d\n\nThis language, in which Twitter calls the error, \u201cthe issue that allowed this to occur,\u201d is way too passive. Feels like someone\u2019s trying to distance themselves from the situation. I\u2019m willing to bet this issue wasn\u2019t so much \u201callowed\u201d to occur as it was actively implemented by someone, and the company is hoping to save face by revealing it now and saying it\u2019s \u201ctaking steps to make sure we don\u2019t make a mistake like this again.\u201d\n\nAnother reason the company might want to \u2018fess up now? Facebook was called out for doing the exact same thing last year. When it confirmed this to TechCrunch, a spokesperson said, \u201cWe use the information people provide to offer a better, more personalized experience on Facebook, including ads. We are clear about how we use the information we collect, including the contact information that people upload or add to their own accounts.\u201d The only solution it offered for people who didn\u2019t want their information used this way? Don\u2019t use phone-number-based 2FA.\n\nThis flip attitude towards users\u2019 personal information was one of the major violations cited in the FTC\u2019s complaint against Facebook, according to the Washington Post. And in July, Facebook was slapped with a $5 billion fine over this complaint. Now you might know why Twitter\u2019s so eager to apologize.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling vulnerable and want to do something about it, Twitter does offer authenticator-based 2FA, meaning you don\u2019t have to use any personal information. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s something.\n\nRead next: Google exploited homeless black people to develop the Pixel 4's facial recognition AI", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F11%2FTwitter_stock.jpg&signature=3851f6d46fbac388f45103584ec86de7", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
