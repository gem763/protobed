What is a tariff and how do they work? We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nBEIJING \u2013 China demanded Washington lift sanctions on Chinese tech companies and warned Wednesday that it will \u201cresolutely safeguard\u201d the country\u2019s interests.\n\nThe Ministry of Commerce criticized curbs imposed on sales of U.S. technology to a group of Chinese companies as interference in the country\u2019s affairs. American officials say those companies provide technology used to repress Muslim minorities in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.\n\n\u201cWe strongly urge the United States to immediately stop making irresponsible remarks on the issue of Xinjiang, stop interfering with China\u2019s internal affairs and remove relevant Chinese entities from the Entity List as soon as possible,\u201d a ministry statement said. \u201cChina will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard Chinese interests.\u201d\n\nThe ministry gave no details of possible retaliation.\n\nHopes are dim: US and China meet for 13th round of high-stakes trade talks\n\nIn this file photo taken on April 4, 2019 China's Vice Premier Liu He (L) speaks with US President Donald Trump during a trade meeting in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, DC.

Those technologies are part of the ruling Communist Party\u2019s industry development plans.\n\nBe prepared: These popular tax breaks might be gone for good\n\nThe U.S. government and independent researchers say as many as 1 million Muslims in Xinjiang have been sent to detention camps. The government says those facilities are job training centers and its activities are aimed at thwarting terrorism and radicalism.\n\nBeijing has tried for decades to suppress sentiment in Xinjiang in favor of independence or more autonomy for the territory. Chinese authorities say scattered incidents of violence blamed on radicals are part of an international Islamic terrorist movement, but independent researchers say they see no evidence to support that.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/09/china-demands-us-curb-tech-sanctions-before-thursday-trade-talks/3917552002/", "description": "The 13th round of U.S.-China trade negotiations are set to begin Thursday in Washington, D.C.", "authors": ["Joe Mcdonald", "Associated Press", "Published A.M.
