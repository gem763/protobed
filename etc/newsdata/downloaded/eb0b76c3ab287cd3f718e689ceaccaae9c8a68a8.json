Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called China\u2019s policies \u201cthe stain of the century\u201d in July, and that same month, 22 countries, including Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, and Japan, signed a letter to the United Nations raising serious concerns about Beijing\u2019s internment of its Muslim minorities. In response, a second letter emerged a few days later, signed by 37 countries endorsing Beijing\u2019s policies in Xinjiang.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a sign of China\u2019s new global position, and it shows the diplomatic effects of [Belt and Road], which is no doubt a goal of the project,\u201d James Millward, a China expert and professor at Georgetown University, told me. \u201cYet it\u2019s hard to call this a success. Xinjiang has hurt China\u2019s soft power, and they\u2019ve largely been caught off guard by the international attention its received.\u201d\n\nThe camps in Xinjiang have not helped China\u2019s reputation in Kazakhstan. Nearly 1.5 million ethnic Kazakh Chinese nationals live in Xinjiang, making them the second-largest Muslim group in the region, after Uighurs. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, 200,000 ethnic Kazakhs from China have moved to Kazakhstan and become Kazakh citizens, including Bilash; tens of thousands of other ethnic Kazakh Chinese nationals live in Kazakhstan as permanent residents, according to estimates. Stuck between popular anger and deepening ties with Beijing, the Kazakh government has tried to strike a balance. The country\u2019s tightly controlled media have given limited coverage to the issue, and when they have, it has largely echoed Beijing\u2019s state propaganda. Meanwhile, Kazakh authorities have engaged in behind-the-scenes diplomacy with China, and managed to secure the release of some Kazakh citizens and ethnic Kazakhs from the camps.\n\nIn getting Bilash to sign a plea deal, the Kazakh authorities have sucked the air out of the activism around the internment camps. Several former camp detainees I spoke with following Bilash\u2019s arrest in March said the move sent a chill among the community of camp survivors and their families. With Bilash no longer active, former detainees and those with family members still missing in the camps will be far less willing to share their stories, they said, especially given Beijing\u2019s tactic of threatening and targeting the families of activists who still live in China.\n\nRead: China's jaw-dropping family separation policy\n\nGene Bunin, a Russian American writer and translator who runs the Xinjiang Victims Database, a project documenting the testimonies of detainees and their families, told me that Bilash\u2019s deal is a blow to those in the Central Asian country working on the issue. He continues to work with activists in Kazakhstan, and has gathered and published more than 5,000 detailed testimonies in his online database, which he said is a \u201cgrassroots weapon\u201d that \u201cChina reacts to,\u201d noting how public testimonies have led to interned family members being allowed to contact their relatives or being released from the camps and placed into another form of detention, such as house arrest.\n\nBut he said that with Bilash no longer active, much of the momentum within the activist community has been slowed. Atajurt, the organization headed by Bilash that once drew global attention to Xinjiang, has been operating at a limited capacity and could shut down without its leader.\n\n\u201cWhat kept them going was hope that he could be freed and things would continue as before,\u201d Bunin said. \u201cI hope I\u2019m wrong.\u201d\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
