REUTERS/Azad Lashkari\n\nTurkey\u2019s currency - which suffered a crisis a year ago due in part to U.S. sanctions and tariffs - hit its weakest level in nearly four months after U.S. troops left northeast Syria and Ankara ordered attacks on Kurdish forces there.\n\nIn recent months the lira had steadied and inflation had fallen, suggesting Turkey\u2019s $766 billion economy, the largest in the Middle East, had left behind its worst slump in nearly two decades.\n\nThe central bank has slashed interest rates since July to kick-start lending. But by Thursday, market expectations tmsnrt.rs/2HFCPtg for further policy easing were reined in as investors worried that fallout from the conflict could delay the recovery.\n\nThe risks include higher deficits and borrowing costs and slowing tourism if Turkey\u2019s military gets bogged down over a long period.\n\nBut the biggest threat - and one that investors say is not priced into Turkish assets - is a new determination among senior U.S. Republicans to punish Turkey for attacking Syrian Kurds, key allies of Washington in the battle against Islamic State.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, usually a strong defender of Donald Trump, on Wednesday joined a Democratic colleague to unveil a framework for sanctions, making good on his criticism of the president\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops.\n\nGraham\u2019s proposal would target the assets of Erdogan and other top officials, impose visa restrictions, and sanction anyone who conducted military transactions with Turkey or supported energy production.\n\nTurkey may face broader sanctions too under the Graham plan over its purchase this year of Russian S-400 missile defenses despite Washignton\u2019s strong objections.\n\nFRAGILE\n\n\u201c(Broader sanctions) would change the economic picture of Turkey totally and we would have to take into account the possibility of a new recession in a situation where the economy is fragile after the 2018 crisis,\u201d said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.\n\nIt is unclear whether Congress would back Graham\u2019s sanctions or whether it would have the two-thirds \u201csuper majority\u201d needed to overcome any veto by Trump, who has a good working rapport with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and spoke with him before pulling out U.S. troops.\n\nIt is also unclear whether Trump would support sanctions after he said earlier this week that the United States would \u201cobliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if it did anything \u201coff limits\u201d in Syria, without defining what that means.\n\n\u201cThe more political pressure comes, the more Trump might be inclined to state that Turkish action might be off limits,\u201d added Leuchtmann.\n\nDuring last year\u2019s spat, Trump imposed limited sanctions and higher tariffs on some Turkish imports to pressure Turkey to release Andrew Brunson, an American pastor who was detained there over terrorism charges, and who was later released.\n\nWEAKER LIRA, FEWER RATE CUTS\n\nThe lira, which lost nearly 30% of its value last year, has shed more than 3% so far this week in volatile trade as it approached as much as 5.90 against the dollar.\n\nTraders said it was unclear how much further it would have fallen had state banks not stepped in to sell dollars and cushion the blow earlier this week.\n\nIn foreign investment-reliant Turkey, the currency largely determines prices, which in turn determines monetary policy. Investors said any lira move beyond 6 could signal expectations that sanctions are likely to bite.\n\nA senior Turkish banker who requested anonymity said the weakness so far reflects immediate geopolitics surrounding the incursion rather than sanctions, which loom as \u201cthe biggest threat\u201d.\n\n\u201cRelations with the United States are an important concern that we cannot predict yet,\u201d he said, adding concerns would persist at least until Erdogan\u2019s planned talks with Trump in the United States on Nov. 13.\n\nTurkish Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak may attend annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington next week.\n\nWhile Albayrak has in recent weeks painted a picture of Turkish economic resilience, this week bonds and stocks have plunged, including a more than 5% drop in Turkey\u2019s main share index.\n\nMoney market traders TRYAM3L3MF3M= now predict the central bank will cut rates to 15% by year-end, from 16.5% now, rather than the 13.5% they had predicted at the end of last week. Four traders said a 50- to 75-point cut is expected later this month.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Markets pull back Turkish rate-cut expectaions - here)\n\nIn a statement, the Treasury said: \u201cWe do not expect a permanent negative impact on the Turkish economy. The (military) operation... prevents losses that might arise in the future in many different areas.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurkey gave its economy a stronger structure in the past year for all kinds of scenarios with the measures it implemented,\u201d it added.\n\nNATIONALIST BACKLASH\n\nAnkara\u2019s incursion into Syria, dubbed Operation Peace Spring, is the latest strain on its relationship with NATO ally Washington, despite what Erdogan has called \u201ca different kind of trust\u201d between him and Trump.\n\nImposing more sanctions could trigger a backlash in Turkey. In a fiery speech on Wednesday, Erdogan whipped up nationalist emotions against European countries that have criticized the incursion.\n\n\u201cRight now the (Turkish) nationalist zeal has sky-rocketed,\u201d said Galip Dalay, a visiting scholar at Oxford University.\n\n\u201cIf approved, U.S. sanctions would only convince people in Ankara that it was the right decision to get closer to Russia (by buying the missile defenses), and that Trump is sympathetic to them even while the rest of the DC establishment is hostile.\u201d", "description": "One casualty of Turkey's military incursion into Syria may be its own recovery from recession after U.S. congressional leaders threatened sanctions that could hit the lira and harden Turkish distrust of Western allies.", "authors": ["Jonathan Spicer", "Nevzat Devranoglu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439327133&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991LF-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
