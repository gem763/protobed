She hasn't really seen him much lately but she's going to be so angry when she finds out what he's been doing.\n\n\"I hope she gives him a good telling off.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images for Nickelodeon Sli)\n\n(Image: Getty Images for Nickelodeon Sli)\n\nGary, played by Mikey North, has been heading down a dark path ever since he got involved with loan shark Rick Neelan.\n\nGary owed Rick a lot of money and they ended up fighting to the death.\n\nAfter murdering Rick, Gary took over his loan business and has been involved in some dodgy dealings and has been handing out the beatings.\n\nHe's also sparked up a scam where he's bought the knicker factory, making one of his customers pose as the investor so nobody knows it's him.\n\nGary has also been unmasked as the culprit behind the Underworld roof collapse which killed Rana Habeeb on her wedding day and saw the business closed down in the first place.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nEllie, 18, recently completed her studies at college and is concentrating on her work with the ITV soap.\n\nShe said: \"I've just finished college now and all my friends have gone off to uni but I'm not because of work and everything it's not really something I'd like to do.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gary has been revealed as Maria Connor's new love interest.\n\nActress Samia Longchambon told us: \"She's so unlucky in love, it just never works out. You know whenever she's happy that it's not going to last.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"This current storyline and who she gets together with next, I think I can say it's Gary, it's been teased, and that's going to be full of twists and turns, and you just know that's not going to end well either.\n\n\"Let's let her be happy for a little bit though.\"\n\nShe added: \"I'm really excited to do it.
