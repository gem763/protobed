The \u201990s hits blaring from the D.J. booth were no match for the applause that erupted when Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the star and creator of \u201cFleabag,\u201d made her way into the party with her boyfriend, the writer-director Martin McDonagh, in tow. From the second she walked in, Ms. Waller-Bridge was so besieged by well-wishers that she could barely get a bite of food or even light her cigarette.\n\nNo wonder. \u201cFleabag\u201d upset the HBO awards show juggernaut \u201cVeep\u201d for best comedy, and Ms. Waller-Bridge claimed three Emmys over all. She beat Julia Louis-Dreyfus to win best actress in a comedy, the first time in the show\u2019s seven seasons that Ms. Louis-Dreyfus did not win.\n\n\u201cWe had a great night,\u201d Mr. McDonagh said. \u201cI was hoping for one. Who knew?\u201d\n\nAmazon has had the reputation in Hollywood for being a sleeping giant. It spends plenty and has seemingly infinite resources, but, despite the earlier success of shows like \u201cTransparent,\u201d its overall impact has been muted.\n\nNow, between \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d and \u201cFleabag,\u201d it has back-to-back Emmy comedy winners. And it is a sign that there are plenty of competitors \u2014 particularly from the tech world \u2014 ready to go toe to toe with HBO.\n\nWith all that, HBO is not pushing the panic button just yet.\n\n\u201cI have the benefit of being here for 15 years, so I\u2019ve heard this over and over again,\u201d said Casey Bloys, HBO\u2019s president of programming. \u201cThis is the world we live in, and our formula of curation and betting on people we believe in and doing the hard work, it pays off.", "description": "The cable network won more Emmys than anyone else on Sunday night, but competition is growing and its new leadership has little entertainment experience.", "authors": ["John Koblin", "Nicole Sperling"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/23/business/23hbo-sub/23hbo-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
