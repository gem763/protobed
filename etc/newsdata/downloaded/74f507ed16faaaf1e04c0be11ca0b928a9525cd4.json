Samsung pushed the release to improve the screen hinge. Reviewers, including CNBC, found that the first model was prone to severe damage that prevented the screen from working at all.\n\nThe smaller version sounds like a foldable iteration of the Galaxy Note 10+, which has a similarly sized 6.8-inch display. The Galaxy Note 10+ is really big, so having an option to fold it down and slip it into a pocket could be appealing to people who don't like carrying large phones.\n\nSamsung was not immediately available to comment.\n\nRead more on Bloomberg.", "description": "Samsung is reportedly making a smaller version of the Galaxy Fold folding phone that's smaller and more affordable.", "authors": ["Todd Haselton"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105857169-1555510389367galaxy-fold-6.jpg?v=1555510642"}
