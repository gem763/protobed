So, we have to turn the page here.\u201d\n\nWatson was great against Atlanta, throwing for a career-high 426 yards and tying a personal best with five touchdown passes. His day was certainly helped by the fact that he wasn\u2019t sacked after taking 18 through the first four games.\n\n\u201cAny quarterback that\u2019s any good, when you give them time to throw, they can see the field, they know what the coverage is, and he\u2019s an excellent quarterback, so, when he has time to throw \u2026 he\u2019s probably going to find the open guy,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\nWatson\u2019s big day was helped by Will Fuller stepping up with a career-best 217 yards receiving and three touchdowns with the Falcons focused on slowing down superstar receiver DeAndre Hopkins. Fuller said it was the most yards receiving he\u2019d had since he had 276 in a game in high school.\n\nFuller missed the second half of last season after tearing a knee ligament and had gotten off to a slow start this year before Sunday\u2019s breakout game. He admitted that he\u2019s not quite back to normal yet, but that he\u2019s getting close.\n\n\u201cIt still gets stiff here and there, so I\u2019m still working on some things, still going in treatment, taking care of my knee,\u201d he said. \u201cBut definitely, health played a big part. I\u2019m starting to feel more and more like myself \u2026 but just staying on top of it because it\u2019s a serious injury, so I don\u2019t want it to get stiff.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nHouston did whatever it wanted on offense Sunday, scoring on all but two possessions against the Falcons. While Fuller grabbed the bulk of Watson\u2019s passes, the third-year quarterback did a good job of spreading the ball around behind solid protection. He completed passes to seven players and utilized his tight ends effectively with Darren Fells adding two touchdown receptions.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nO\u2019Brien is concerned about ball security after the Texans fumbled five times on Sunday. Watson fumbled twice and Fuller, Carlos Hyde and DeAndre Carter all fumbled once. The Texans got some lucky bounces and recovered all but one of the fumbles. But O\u2019Brien knows that they won\u2019t always be that fortunate if they keep coughing the ball up that much and said they\u2019d work on it in practice this week.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nThe Texans drafted Fuller in the first round in 2016 in hopes that he\u2019d give them another top-tier receiver to take some pressure off Hopkins. He\u2019s shown flashes of that talent during his first three seasons, but has struggled with various injuries and has failed to contribute consistently. Now Fuller will look to build on his career day and help Houston\u2019s offense improve as the season progresses.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nKicker Ka\u2019imi Fairbairn made both of his field goals on Sunday but missed two extra points a week after missing a field goal and an extra point. O\u2019Brien said he isn\u2019t too concerned about the struggles and knows Fairbairn is working to get better.\n\n\u201cHe has to make the kicks,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe knows that. He\u2019d be the first to tell you that \u2026 he knows that it\u2019s just a matter of plant foot, and he\u2019s pushing a little bit.\u201d\n\nINJURED\n\nReceiver Kenny Stills sat out on Sunday with a hamstring injury and it\u2019s unclear if he\u2019ll be able to return this week.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n1 - Watson has thrown 11 touchdowns this season with just one interception.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nHouston\u2019s offensive line looked good against the struggling Falcons, but will need to play better this week against the 4-1 Chiefs to give Watson time to throw and build on what he did against Atlanta. Houston\u2019s secondary has struggled at times this year and will be tested this week against Patrick Mahomes, who leads the NFL with 1,831 yards passing. The Colts sacked him a season-high four times in Kansas City\u2019s first loss, and Houston\u2019s defensive front will need to get to him on Sunday to help take some pressure off the secondary.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Houston Texans are coming off their best offensive game of the year and one of the best in franchise history.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/falcons_texans_football_57354_c0-123-3716-2289_s1770x1032.jpg?1240692078f2715fe83f24922d62f4b8cd168bda", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
