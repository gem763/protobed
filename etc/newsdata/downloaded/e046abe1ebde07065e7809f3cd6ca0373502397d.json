He said poverty must be fought against and overcome.\n\nThe pope visited Akamasoa, the \u201cCity of Friendship,\u201d a community founded 30 years ago for very poor families by a former student of Pope Francis, Father Pedro Pablo Opeka, an Argentine missionary.\n\n\u201cIt is a great joy for me to meet you in this great work,\u201d Francis said. \u201cAkamasoa is the expression of God\u2019s presence in the midst of his poor people; not a sporadic, circumstantial presence, but the presence of a God who decided to live and always remain in the midst of his people.\u201d\n\nSome 8,000 brightly dressed young people were present to greet the pope with songs and chants.\n\n\u201cSeeing your radiant faces,\u201d the pope said, \u201cI thank the Lord who has heard the cry of the poor and who has manifested his love with concrete signs such as the creation of this town.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour cries that arise from the powerlessness of living without a roof, of seeing your children grow up malnourished, of joblessness, because of the indifferent \u2014 not to say disdainful \u2014 gaze of so many, have become songs of hope for you and for all who contemplate you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEvery corner of these neighborhoods, every school or clinic is a song of hope that denies and silences all inevitability,\u201d he added. \u201cLet us say it loudly: poverty is not an inevitability.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis town is the result of many years of hard work\u201d and \u201chas a long history of courage and mutual help,\u201d Francis said. \u201cIn its foundations we find a living faith that has been translated into concrete acts, capable of \u2018moving mountains.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis faith has \u201callowed us to see possibility where only precariousness was seen, to see hope where only hopelessness was seen, to see life where so many announced death and destruction,\u201d he said, reminding the people of the saying of the apostle Saint James: \u201cFaith without works is dead.\u201d\n\nPart of the legacy of Akamasoa, Francis said, is an education in values instilled by Father Opeka, resulting in an \u201cenormous treasure of effort, discipline, honesty, respect for themselves and others.\u201d\n\nThis has led the town to comprehend \u201cGod\u2019s dream\u201d of personal development and especially the progress of the whole community, he said, since there is no worse slavery \u201cthan for each person to live only for himself.\u201d\n\nDear young people of Akamasoa, the pope concluded, \u201cnever cross your arms before the dire effects of poverty, and never succumb to the temptations of the easy path or of locking yourselves in yourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet the gifts that the Lord has given you flourish in you. Ask him to help you put yourself at the service of your brothers and sisters with generosity. Thus, Akamasoa will not only be an example for future generations, but much more,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome.", "description": "Poverty is not something foreordained or inevitable but must be fought against, Pope Francis told young people in Madagascar on Sunday.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
