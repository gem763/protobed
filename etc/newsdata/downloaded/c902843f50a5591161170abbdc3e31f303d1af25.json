Honestly, it does take a while to get an exceptional score, but right now, that shouldn't be your focus.\n\nAt this moment, your goal is to boost your credit as fast as you can. If you stick to a few rules, you will increase your credit score within the next few months.\n\nThe Basic FICO Facts\n\nIt can feel daunting to build your credit from scratch, but I promise you, it can be done. It just takes time and patience.\n\nHere are the minimum requirements for a FICO score:\n\n-- You need to have one account open for at least six months.\n\n-- Your account needs to be reported to the credit bureaus within the past six months.\n\n-- You need to make sure there's no sign that you're deceased.\n\nOK, the last bullet point sounds a little comical, but there's a reason it's listed. If your account was shared with someone who died and who was reported as deceased, then this could affect your account. If possible, try to open an account in your own name.\n\nWith VantageScore, another consumer credit scoring model, you can generate a credit score with less than six months of credit history. But you have no control over which score a lender will request. There's always the chance you'll get lucky and your lender will use VantageScore. But be prepared for a six-month wait since 90% of lenders use FICO scores.\n\n[Read: Best Secured Credit Cards.]\n\nWays to Build Credit Fast\n\nRemember, you're looking for ways to break into the credit world, so don't worry about your low -- or nonexistent -- FICO score. The goal right now is to take steps to remedy your credit situation.\n\nHere are a few ideas to get you started:\n\nGet a secured credit card. With these cards, you make a security deposit, which often becomes your credit limit. You get a credit card that looks just like an unsecured credit card. As long as the issuer reports to the bureaus and you use the card responsibly, you'll build a good credit history.\n\nThese cards are fairly easy to get, but if you're rebuilding your credit and you have a lot of negative items on your credit report, it's possible to get turned down. If this happens, there are a few decent secured cards that don't do credit checks. But be sure you read the fine print, because there are also predatory lenders out there who target consumers in your situation.\n\nApply for a credit-builder loan. If you're uneasy about getting a secured credit card, then a credit-builder loan is a good option. Your score won't matter. But you do have to show proof of income so that you can make payments.\n\nHere's how it works: You apply for a loan (with payments you can afford), and when approved, you deposit the amount you \"borrowed\" into a savings account. You then make monthly payments until you've paid off the amount. (There are variations in which you don't have to make a deposit.)\n\nWhen it's paid off, you get your deposit back, plus a little interest. These loans are more likely to be offered by credit unions and local banks, so shop around and find a loan that works with your budget.\n\n[Read: Best Starter Credit Cards for Building Credit.]\n\nGet a co-signer. This is a way to build credit by using someone else's credit. You find someone, usually a parent or a relative, who has excellent credit. Then, you ask this person if they'd be willing to become a co-signer so you can get approved for a credit card.\n\nClearly, this can become a sticky situation. If your target co-signer is willing, then suggest a face-to-face discussion about the rules. Decide how much you'll spend on the card each month, what payment reminders you plan to set up and what happens if you default on the account. And keep in mind that not all of the major issuers allow co-signers, so do your research before the meeting.\n\nLegally, your co-signer is also responsible for your debt. So, it's essential you hold up your end of this. Can you imagine what holiday dinners will be like if you don't pay the bill on time? That alone should be enough incentive to do a good job and focus on building credit.\n\nBecome an authorized user. If you prefer to avoid the possible complications that can occur with a co-signer, then ask someone with great credit if you can become an authorized user on one of their credit cards.\n\nStory continues", "description": "You've probably heard that you need a long credit history (a trillion years, at least) and a whole slew of credit lines to have an \"exceptional\" credit score, which is 800-plus.
