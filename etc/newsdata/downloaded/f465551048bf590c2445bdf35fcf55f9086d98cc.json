But now it\u2019s not clear if Netanyahu will be around much longer to return those favors.\n\nIsrael\u2019s election rerun produced a dramatic deadlock, thrusting a key Mideast ally into further political turmoil just as Trump gears up to release his peace proposal and prepares for a re-election fight in which he is certain to boast about his pro-Israel credentials.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s view is \u2018I\u2019ve been very good to this guy, we have a warm relationship, and I have an election year coming up, so he better help me the way I helped him\u2019,\u201d said David Makovsky, director of the project on Middle East peace at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and author of a new book on Israeli leaders. \u201cThere\u2019s been no doubt who Trump was for in this election.\u201d\n\nIsrael Heads Into Unknown as Netanyahu\u2019s Election Gamble Fails\n\nWhile initial exit surveys suggest Netanyahu stumbled in this election, having failed to muster a decisive victory after a hard-fought campaign, it is too early to say former military chief Benny Gantz won either.\n\nWith most votes counted by midday Wednesday, Netanyahu\u2019s nationalist Likud slightly trailed Gantz\u2019s centrist Blue and White. Neither party has the backing of 61 of parliament\u2019s 120 lawmakers, leaving each to reach out to other potential governing partners.\n\nTrump acknowledged the tight race in comments to reporters in Los Angeles on Wednesday, saying the election is \u201cvery close.\u201d On Monday he had said he thought Netanyahu \u201chas a good chance\u201d to pull out a governing majority. But in the latest sign that the administration is starting to hedge its bets on who Israel\u2019s next prime minister will be, Trump said in Los Angeles that \u201cour relationship is with Israel,\u201d not a specific leader.\n\nVice President Mike Pence did not meet with Netanyahu earlier this month in London, despite the leaders both holding talks at 10 Downing Street within minutes of one another. Regardless, Trump has not been subtle about the outcome he\u2019d like to see from the election.\n\nThe administration has repeatedly delayed the release of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner\u2019s long-awaited Middle East peace plan, sparing Netanyahu from having to grapple with potentially divisive proposals ahead of an election. The Trump administration was also quiet on Netanyahu\u2019s campaign pledge to annex West Bank settlements if he wins, a vow that previous U.S. presidents would have almost certainly castigated.\n\nNetanyahu Takes Cabinet to West Bank to Hammer Home Vote MessageAnnex West Bank? How an Idea Lost Its Taboo in Israel: QuickTake\n\nNetanyahu and Trump, who\u2019ve both enjoyed the backing of Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, have built a relationship over the years based on mutual political expediency, leveraging their ties to score points against their rivals back home. Netanyahu repeatedly reminded voters during his campaign of his access to Trump, while the U.S. president encouraged Netanyahu to bar two freshmen Democratic House members from entering the country in an effort to paint the Democratic party as anti-Israel.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump said he and Netanyahu held a phone call to discuss a mutual defense treaty that could \u201cfurther anchor the tremendous alliance between our two countries.\u201d Amos Yadlin, executive director of Tel Aviv University\u2019s Institute for National Security Studies, said the issue was \u201cdeserving deep discussion, and not a quick draw shot from the hip on the eve of election.\u201d\n\nBut after Trump moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, closed the Palestinian representative office in the U.S., withdrew from the Iran deal, cut off funding to a United Nations agency helping Palestinian refugees and later recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which was captured from Syria during the 1967 war, there were few hanging fruits left to offer Netanyahu.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The tight Israeli election -- and the weeks of debate it may fuel over the formation of a ruling coalition -- has put President Donald Trump on the brink of losing one of his closest foreign allies.Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has given Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the", "authors": ["David Wainer", "Justin Sink"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.Mo36rHP9gfwzxxClJ_0RQ--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/6f32489a0a0626bce087ebfe33d5a538", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
