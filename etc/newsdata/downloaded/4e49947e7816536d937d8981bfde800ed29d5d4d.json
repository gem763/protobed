He says the Australian government should force the major banks to unwind the consolidation that was allowed to occur over the past 20 years.\n\nHe says Westpac Banking Corp should be forced to divest the loan assets acquired through its takeovers of Bank of Melbourne and St George Bank, while Commonwealth Bank of Australia should be forced to divest Bankwest.\n\n\u2018\u2018This won\u2019t be easy,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018But the UK did something similar following the global financial crisis when it forced RBS to sell portfolios of SME loans to a range of other banks. It was a way of getting competition back in the system.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018The only way there\u2019s ever going to be any radical change here is if there is a significant shift in public policy towards a more pro-competitive system.\n\n\u2018\u2018The three regulators \u2013 APRA, ASIC and the ACCC \u2013 do not have a mandate to promote competition in banking, and that\u2019s what is needed.\u2019\u2019\n\nHealy\u2019s ideas will resonate with plenty of politicians from both sides of parliament. They will come as music to the ears of the competition regulator, Rod Sims, who wants the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to be given the mandate to investigate competition in banking.\n\nBankers dread another inquiry into the financial system after all the angst and disruption caused by the Hayne royal commission. But Healy says Hayne's inquiry was all about misconduct and never properly explored competition issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018The royal commission never dealt with the fundamental structural issues in the industry,\u2019\u2019 he says.\n\nHealy says there are four key themes in his book. First, the industry is significantly challenged because of the financialisation of the economy over many years.\n\nHe says there was a decoupling of the financial economy from the real economy because of the pressure on bankers to sell as many products as possible.\n\nHealy\u2019s attack on the big four will be considered by many in the industry as opportunistic and promoting his own vested interests.\n\n\u2018\u2018The industry became all about selling as much as it could to each customer. It moved away from the role of traditional banking with its customer-centric model,\u2019\u2019 he says.\n\nThe second theme is the social licence to operate. \u2018\u2018The banks should understand this, but they don\u2019t. An industry that is essentially quasi-national should operate in the public interest as much as in the self-interest of profit maximisation,\u2019\u2019 he says.\n\nThe third theme is the culture of the big four, which he describes as \u2018\u2018locked in concrete\u2019\u2019. He says bankers are loath to change the way they do business.\n\nThe fourth theme is market failure.\n\n\u2018\u2018Banks act in their self-interest rather than the interest of the economy,\u2019\u2019 he says. Healy says the worst example of this is in lending to small business, which cannot obtain sufficient working capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMajor banks are focused on credit risk protection ahead of all else and therefore demand residential property as collateral. This stops healthy businesses generating cash flow from refinancing without additional property assets.\n\nHealy\u2019s attack on the big four will be considered by many in the industry as opportunistic and promoting his own vested interests.\n\nAs the co-founder of SME lender Judo Bank, Healy is trying to build a loan book of $10 billion within three years using a strategy which includes poaching relationship bankers and SME clients from the big four.\n\nHealy says a typical big four CEO in Australia turns up for work ... knowing that about 98 per cent of the year's profit is locked in.\n\nJudo has clearly struck a rich vein of opportunity in the SME lending space. It is lending about $170 million a month and predicts it will have a loan book of $1 billion by the end of the year.\n\nHealy is not the first banker to draw on his experience to excoriate the industry that paid him handsomely.\n\nHis credentials are impressive, including membership of the NAB executive committee for six years from 2008 to 2014 as group executive, and divisional chief executive of NAB business banking. Prior to that he worked at ANZ as managing director, global client relationships.\n\nHealy says there are about half a dozen reasons for the problems in the Australian banking system, including the incentives to sell products and the belief among bank boards of directors that local senior bankers needed to be paid as much as their counterparts in New York and London.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018The major banks have accepted the idea that you are operating on a different floor in the same global building rather than in different market structures,\u2019\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018\u2018The market structures here are a gift that keeps on giving. Realistically, a CEO should be paid about $2 million, including salary and bonuses.\u2019\u2019\n\nHealy says a typical big four CEO in Australia turns up for work on the first day of the financial year knowing that about 98 per cent of the year\u2019s profit is locked in.\n\nHe says banks are complicated but the market structure means profits are predictable. \u2018\u2018The pay should be more in line with running a utility,\u2019\u2019 he says.\n\nHealy says Judo has tried to introduce the transparency that should be evident at the big four. One example is that it charges a fixed margin over the bank bill swap rate.\n\nUnder this arrangement borrowers from Judo saw their interest rate fall by about 82 basis points over the past year, whereas a small business borrower at one of the big four banks would probably have only had a rate cut of about 26 basis points, he points out.", "description": "A former high-flyer at NAB and ANZ says the big lenders have excessive market power and are extracting unreasonable rents from the economy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_111/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/204e7d996155f59c197f9eaacb66edffd97510c7", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
