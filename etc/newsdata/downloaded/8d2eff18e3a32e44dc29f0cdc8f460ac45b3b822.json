(Photo: Amazon) More\n\nA kitchen scale is one of those items you think you don\u2019t need \u2014 until you use one and never look back. Weighing food is great for counting calories or whipping up recipes that call for very specific measurements.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering a kitchen scale, now\u2019s the time to act: At $9, down from $19, the Etekcity Food Digital Kitchen Weight Scale is a steal. There are lots of reasons we love this model (and obviously customers do too; it\u2019s an Amazon\u2019s #1 best seller). It\u2019s made of food-grade stainless steel, is easy to clean and has a backlit display for those midnight measuring sessions.\n\nThis scale is perfect for portion control \u2014 weigh out your meals, place them in containers, and you\u2019re set for the week. And at about 6 by 7 inches, it doesn\u2019t take up much counter space and is thin enough to slip into a drawer. We like the big, easy-to-read numbers and the auto-off feature, so it\u2019ll save the battery even when your hands are coated in breadcrumbs. We also appreciate that it comes with two AAA batteries (isn\u2019t that nice?).\n\nThe scale lets you measure in grams, ounces, pounds and milliliters, and features a separate mode for weighing milk and water volume. And, no, it won\u2019t count your container in the calculations \u2014 a handy feature subtracts the weight of your bowl or plate.\n\nYes, there are lots of kitchen scales on the market \u2014 but this one gets great reviews and is only nine bucks for a limited time!\n\n\u201cI bought this scale to measure some of the food I was eating while on my calorie deficit diet,\u201d says a happy camper. \u201cIt works great...The scale is easy to read and easy to manipulate into grams/oz/lbs, etc. It\u2019s kind of a no-brainer tool that I leave on the kitchen counter. I used it over Christmas to weigh my meals and it really helped in my calorie calculations. I use Myfitnesspal and if you are serious about counting calories you should consider investing in a food scale of some sort...otherwise you're eyeballing it. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I had been under-estimating my weights for some of my favorite foods :-)...\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the scale you want if you're looking for an all-around best compact, sleek, basic food scale,\u201d raves another fan. \u201cThe reason you want this is its overall attention to the small details. It's super thin; I literally just stick it in my kitchen drawer on top of the ziplock bags and it fits unassumingly right in there. It's got a uniform, stainless steel surface, which just makes it look and feel good plus minimizes the effort put into cleaning it. Backlit display is nice. Auto-off feature is essential; if your hands are dirty and occupied when cooking, it sucks having to hit a button to save the battery \u2014 just leave this one be and it goes back to sleep like a good little scale.\u201d\n\nEtekcity Food Digital Kitchen Weight Scale More\n\nShop it: Etekcity Food Digital Kitchen Weight Scale, $9 (was $19), amazon.com\n\nThe reviews quoted above reflect the most recent versions at the time of publication.\n\nRead More from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
