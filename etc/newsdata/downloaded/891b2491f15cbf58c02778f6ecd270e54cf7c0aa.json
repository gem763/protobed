Hours later he would eventually confirm that Islamic State chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been killed in a successful US operation which took out several of his associates.\n\n\u201cIt was incredibly loud and started around midnight. The gunfire from the choppers was intense. It woke the residents up and terrified them,\u201d said Ahmed, a Syrian journalist who lives in the area and later went to the site of the raid. He asked for his name to be withheld.\n\n\u201cIt was night and dark. We heard the bullets and didn\u2019t want to leave our houses not knowing what was going on.\n\nHe told The Independent only one family saw what happened close up as they lived in a tent next door to the building where Baghdadi was hiding.\n\n\u201cThey said foreign soldiers with machine guns stormed in and took them away. People they had never seen before. The soldiers told the residents in Arabic to leave but kept some of them sitting underneath an olive tree until they completed the operation.\u201d\n\nAhmed added: \u201cWhen they left, after taking prisoners and killing the rest, a plane came and struck the house to completely destroy it.\u201d\n\nIn a different part of the countryside, another resident said that the exchange of fire went on until 3am.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

They were absolutely huge and lit up the sky,\u201d Mohamed, another local reporter, said.\n\nAnother person said he saw at least three helicopters leaving with what he was told were bodies and captives.\n\n\u201cThe house was completely taken out,\u201d Abu Ahmed added.\n\nMr Trump later said from the White House that Baghdadi died \u201cwhimpering, screaming and crying\u201d as he blew himself up with a suicide vest after being chased into a dead-end tunnel by US army dogs.\n\nThe president confirmed that nine people in total including two women, believed to be Baghdadi\u2019s wives, were also killed, and 11 children were rescued.\n\nThree other children were killed as Baghdadi had apparently dragged them with him into the tunnel when he killed himself.\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog, he died like a coward,\u201d Mr Trump said adding that Baghdadi\u2019s identity was positively confirmed by a DNA test conducted onsite.\n\nPlanning for the operation began two weeks ago and had to be called off twice because Baghdadi switched plans.\n\nEight military helicopters flew for more than an hour over territory controlled by Russian and Syrian forces and landed under gunfire, Trump confirmed.\n\nThe US forces spent around two hours in the compound and took away \u201dsensitive information\u201d relating to Isis, he said.\n\nIraq and the Kurdish forces are believed to have provided vital intelligence on the whereabouts of the wanted jihadi leader.\n\nBack in Barisha, questions were raised about what the Isis chief was doing in Idlib, an area controlled by Isis\u2019s main rivals Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham, who are affiliates of al-Qaeda.\n\nHTS forces, who apparently had no idea their arch-foe was hiding in the area, are currently guarding the raid site and preventing people from having full access.\n\nAt the destroyed compound journalist Ahmed said the building was completely flattened and in one area there was a two-metre deep crater from the airstrikes.\n\nTerrified residents told him US soldiers, who landed in helicopters, ordered civilians to leave or stay back and handed over several children they found in the area to a local shepherd for safekeeping.\n\nAfter a fierce gun battle, the US soldiers were seen leaving with some bodies and captives, others were left scattered behind.\n\n\u201cI counted seven bodies in body bags, one of which was a smaller body bag for a child and two were women,\u201d Ahmed said, after visiting the site on Sunday morning.\n\n\u201cSome bodies were pulled out from under the rubble. Some bodies were burned. I saw one body cut in pieces like it had been blown up,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to local residents, the building was owned by a man known as Abu Mohamed al-Halabi.\n\nIdlib reporters citing HTS sources said he was a well-known figure in Hurras al-Din, a lesser-known al-Qaeda offshoot started by disgruntled former HTS leaders.\n\nThey believe Baghdadi was in the area for high-level meetings to strike deals with the veteran jihadi group. But al-Halabi\u2019s neighbours had no idea.\n\n\u201cI asked about him, but people know nothing except that he is a food trader. They said he was a merchant who drove a blue Hyundai and kept himself to himself,\u201d the reporter continued.\n\n\u201cThe women who lived next door said he would leave in the morning and return only by night. He didn\u2019t get any visitors and never visited anyone. They didn\u2019t know much about him and whether he was a member of any factions.\u201d\n\nNo one saw Baghdadi and his entourage arrive.\n\n\u201cEven his close neighbours living just 4 meters away, said they didn\u2019t know anything about Halabi or that Baghdadi was there,\u201d Mohamed said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's incredible we had no idea such an important and wanted person was right there.\u201d", "description": "It was midnight on a quiet Saturday night when the residents of Barisha village\u00a0in northwest Syria\u00a0were jolted awake by the deafening trill of helicopters overhead, and the drumbeat of heavy machine gunfire.
