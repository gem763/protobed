First-time film-makers frequently face an uphill battle getting noticed amid the noise and the circus of a film festival, and even more of a challenge securing distribution. Punters can be reluctant to take a risk on an unknown quantity in a festival schedule \u2013 on a director whose name isn\u2019t instantly recognisable and whose CV contains perhaps only a couple of short films. But in fact, first features are often the most exciting films in a programme. Rather than coasting into a screening slot on the strength of a director\u2019s past successes, first features are chosen on merit. To be selected, a debut has to deliver something accomplished and memorable \u2013 it has to be a forceful statement of intent.\n\nIf the stars align, a successful festival launch can lead to a film that woos both critics and audiences, providing a career springboard for the director and actors while also doing good business at the box office. Recent examples include Benh Zeitlin\u2019s Beasts of the Southern Wild, which launched in Cannes 2012 and went on to earn four Oscar nominations; Jennifer Kent\u2019s The Babadook and Jordan Peele\u2019s Get Out, first features that premiered to acclaim in Sundance 2014 and 2017 respectively and led to Peele winning an Oscar; and Lady Macbeth (Toronto, 2016), which introduced the incomparable Florence Pugh to the movie world.\n\nIt has been a particularly rich year for buzzy debuts breaking out at film festivals around the world. The trend started at Sundance, with Joe Talbot\u2019s The Last Black Man in San Francisco claiming both a directing prize and the special jury prize. At Cannes a few months later, two first features claimed slots in the main competition: Ladj Ly\u2019s propulsive Parisian crime drama Les Mis\u00e9rables won the jury prize and went on to earn France\u2019s submission in the best foreign language Oscar category. Meanwhile Atlantics, a dreamy blend of supernatural drama and real-world commentary by actor and director Mati Diop, won the grand jury prize at Cannes and is the Senegalese Oscar submission.\n\nIn the vast Toronto film festival programme, it\u2019s easy for the smaller films to get lost, but two British directors made their mark. Rose Glass\u2019s horror Saint Maud was a hit in the festival\u2019s popular Midnight Madness strand, while Nick Rowland\u2019s Ireland-set Calm With Horses established Rowland as a director to watch and lead Cosmo Jarvis (last seen in Lady Macbeth) as a star in the making. Toronto also premiered Sound of Metal, the fiction feature debut from Darius Marder which stars Riz Ahmed as a deaf rock drummer.\n\nThere\u2019s something particularly thrilling about discovering a stand-out first film at a festival \u2013 a sense that you are witnessing the beginning of a career that could go on to shape cinema for years to come. And on the strength of this year\u2019s crop, the future of film is in good hands.\n\nRose Glass: \u2018No other medium has the capacity to put you in someone else\u2019s head as much as film\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Morfydd Clark in Rose Glass\u2019s Saint Maud. Photograph: StudioCanal\n\n\u201cWhen he\u2019s pleased, it\u2019s like a shiver, or sometimes a pulsing,\u201d swoons private carer Maud of her relationship with God, in Rose Glass\u2019s tense, drily funny horror, Saint Maud. Maud assists a dying dancer played by Jennifer Ehle, all the while contemplating her own spiritual rebirth. \u201cAs soon as I started writing stories myself, they always tended to have slightly hallucinatory, sensual elements,\u201d says the movie\u2019s 30-year-old writer\u2011director. Glass\u2019s graduation film, Room 55, featured an uptight TV cook who experiences an epiphany while tied up in Japanese rope bondage.\n\nSince its world premiere at the Toronto film festival last month (where it was snapped up by trendy US distributor A24 Films), Saint Maud has bewitched audiences and industry luminaries alike. Last Sunday at the closing night of London film festival, where it was in the main competition, the jury president, director Wash Westmoreland, said: \u201cThis dazzling directorial debut marks the emergence of a powerful new voice in British cinema.\u201d A week before, when presenting Glass with the IWC Schaffhausen film-maker bursary \u2013 which promises \u00a350,000 of development funding to an early career film-maker \u2013 Danny Boyle described her as an \u201cextraordinary talent\u201d and said that the film\u2019s \u201cconfidence evokes the ecstasy of films like Carrie, The Exorcist and Jonathan Glazer\u2019s Under the Skin\u201d.\n\nBorn near Chelmsford, Essex, Glass studied film and video at the London College of Communication, later graduating from the National Film and Television School in 2014 with a master\u2019s in directing. The film-maker describes her younger self as an \u201cawkward, anxious teen\u201d who would \u201calways try and look up weird violent films and order them off the internet, video nasties, stuff like that\u201d. Darren Aronofsky\u2019s twisted psychological thriller Pi was an early obsession; a VHS of David Lynch\u2019s Eraserhead \u2013 a gift from her father \u2013 gave her a taste for on-screen viscera.\n\nSaint Maud cleverly dances the knife-edge between horror and comedy, and Glass uses her jump scares judiciously. The director\u2019s eyes gleam as she recounts a rumour that at a recent screening an audience member was given such a fright that they \u201cwhacked their elbow so hard they broke it and had to have surgery\u201d.\n\nAlternately devoted and sneering, Maud is an unreliable and darkly hilarious narrator brilliantly brought to life by Welsh actor Morfydd Clark, who has appeared in Carol Morley\u2019s The Falling and Whit Stillman\u2019s Love & Friendship, as well as Armando Ianucci\u2019s forthcoming The Personal History of David Copperfield. Glass says her early pitches imagined the character as \u201cTravis Bickle, if he was a young Catholic woman living in an English seaside town\u201d. She adds: \u201cYou never really know what could happen when someone feels alienated and isn\u2019t able to connect with humans around them. I\u2019m interested in the things that people turn to to try and make sense of the world around them. I don\u2019t think any other medium quite has the capacity to put you in someone else\u2019s head as much as film.\u201d\n\nDescribe your film-making in three words\u2026\n\nStrange, sensual and silly.\n\nWhat\u2019s a film that\u2019s really made an impact on you recently?\n\nJennifer Reeder\u2019s Knives and Skin \u2013 it\u2019s like if John Waters directed a David Lynch movie.

Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy\n\nJoe Talbot and Jimmie Fails, friends since childhood, were raised on stories of what San Francisco was like for their respective families. Talbot is fifth-generation San Franciscan on his mother\u2019s side, Fails is also a native of the city. \u201cIn the grainy footage I\u2019d seen [of the city\u2019s past], and the music from San Francisco, like Jefferson Airplane and Moby Grape and Janis Joplin, there was a real sense of love and optimism before things got dark,\u201d says Talbot, referring to the waves of gentrification and Silicon Valley money that have transformed their city into something \u201cincreasingly unfamiliar\u201d, wiping out black and lower-income neighbourhoods.\n\nSpurred on by their \u201ccollective depression\u201d about these changes, the pair decided to create a film. The result, The Last Black Man in San Francisco, is a gorgeous, sprawling love letter to a Victorian townhouse in the city\u2019s historic and rapidly transforming Fillmore district. Talbot writes and directs, while the story is based on the experiences of Fails, who also stars as a fictionalised version of himself trying, with friend Montgomery (Jonathan Majors), to reclaim a house that may or may not have been built by Fails\u2019s grandfather. Shot on location, Talbot says the film \u201caccidentally became the project of archiving the city, because a lot of those places don\u2019t exist any more\u201d. It was a huge hit at Sundance in January, where it won two awards, including best director, and has since received rave reviews. In June, Rolling Stone called it one of the best movies of the year.\n\nTalbot had an unconventional path into film-making. He attended the Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts, but was, by his own admission, \u201ckind of a nuisance\u201d, and so dropped out. \u201cI grew up in a family of journalists and writers who loved movies, so when we weren\u2019t discussing politics at the dinner table, we were talking about movies and music,\u201d he says. His interest in film-making was inspired by an uncle he describes as \u201cthe family documentarian\u201d, whose camera he used to borrow.\n\nThe Last Black Man in San Francisco began life in 2014 as a \u201cfunky concept trailer\u201d that drummed up plenty of excitement but not enough money to shoot a feature. It was Talbot\u2019s second short, American Paradise, that led to his breakthrough meeting with Brad Pitt\u2019s Plan B production company, which then partnered with A24 films (whose hits include the Oscar-winning Moonlight) to give The Last Black Man in San Francisco the backing it needed.\n\nTalbot\u2019s debut takes a poetic, emotional approach to the problem of gentrification, which is perhaps why the film is resonating so widely. \u201cGentrification is often discussed as statistics, but it\u2019s smells, it\u2019s people that used to sit on their stoops, it\u2019s neighbourhood characters, it\u2019s buildings you loved that were part of your upbringing that are gutted,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wanted the movie to feel like it was out of Jimmie\u2019s heart.\u201d\n\nDo you have a role model?\n\nHal Ashby is someone I look to. It\u2019s the empathy his films have for their characters \u2013 even the mean ones are treated with love.\n\nWho would be your dream actor to work with?\n\nJoaquin Phoenix.\n\nWhat one thing can\u2019t you live without on set?\n\nMy Giants hat. SH\n\nThe Last Black Man in San Francisco is released on Friday\n\nNick Rowland: \u2018I must be the only person to tell their mother \u201cI want to direct films\u201d and for her to be relieved\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Barry Keoghan and Cosmo Jarvis in Calm With Horses. Photograph: Toronto International Film Festival\n\nCalm With Horses, the first feature from Nick Rowland, is a blistering debut. The film, which was executive produced by Michael Fassbender, gives a vivid account of a fateful chapter in the life of a slow-witted heavy called Arm (a revelatory performance from Cosmo Jarvis). He must juggle his allegiance to a toxic criminal family that has embraced him as one of their own against his responsibilities to his ex-girlfriend and their autistic son.\n\nThe film balances a small-town Ireland setting against big themes, crackling humour against aching pathos and casual violence against an empathetic core. Rowland\u2019s work with actors \u2013 Jarvis co-stars with Barry Keoghan and Niamh Algar, both excellent \u2013 is first rate; the level of film-making craft, particularly in the use of sound, is superb. It feels like the work of a director who was born to make movies.\n\nBut in fact, Rowland\u2019s route into cinema was circuitous. Film school came after he had already spent several years as a professional rally driver racing in the Chinese Rally Championship and the British Rally Championship. \u201cI think I must be the only person ever to tell their mother \u2018I want to be a film director\u2019 and for her to be relieved because it was a less risky option than what I was already doing,\u201d he says.\n\nRowland followed his rally career with a stint as a tour guide in an aquarium (a low point was having to dress as Neptune for World Oceans Day) and lived with his mother, who had moved from the Midlands, where Rowland grew up, to Banff in Scotland. \u201cBecause I was away from my friends, I watched lots of movies. And that was the first time I engaged with film properly.\u201d At a career crossroads, Rowland idly took an online multiple choice quiz which suggested that he should be a librarian or a film-maker. He picked the latter and in 2015 graduated from the National Film and Television School.\n\nIt was when he was developing another screenplay that he stumbled on a collection of writing by Colin Barrett, which contained the short story Calm With Horses. \u201cI am dyslexic. I find reading really hard,\u201d says Rowland. \u201cBut I read the whole collection in an afternoon, which is rare for me. And it was quite an instant reaction that this would make a good film. This contrast of a criminal world and a melancholy emotional heart. It felt really fresh.\u201d\n\nWhy film?\n\nI think film is the best way to build empathy. I am very emotionally driven and go to the cinema to feel things. To feel what it is like to be someone else.\n\nWhat film recently made an impact on you?\n\nI saw Saint Maud at Toronto and I thought it was astonishing. I went to film school with Rose [Glass, director]. You can see a line with her work back to her shorts. It\u2019s inspiring to see how her voice has developed.\n\nWhat one thing can\u2019t you live without on set?\n\nHand sanitiser. Lots of hand sanitiser.\n\nCalm With Horses is released next year\n\nMati Diop: \u2018We\u2019re talking about a generation that has disappeared, and that necessarily haunts the living\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mame Bineta Sane in Mati Diop\u2019s Atlantics. Photograph: Les Films du Bal\n\nIn Mati Diop\u2019s eerie, atmospheric first feature, Atlantics, the ocean appears as an ominous presence, deceptively sparkling and calm. The French-Senegalese director first turned her camera on migrants\u2019 dangerous boat journeys to Europe in her 2009 documentary short, Atlantiques. This time, however, she has turned her attention back towards the shore, to the women left behind; the story of Penelope, not Odysseus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to tell the story from a feminine point of view,\u201d Diop says, when we meet ahead of the UK premiere at the London film festival, where it went on to win best first feature. \u201cIt was not a theoretical feminist approach \u2013 it was more personal.\u201d While visiting her family in Dakar, aged 25, after a 10-year absence, she was struck by the number of young people ready to risk their lives at sea. She knew she wanted to tell their story, but didn\u2019t want her film to follow them into the boat: \u201cIt\u2019s not my place, I don\u2019t have a right to be there.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the year, Diop made headlines as the first black female director to compete for the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes in the festival\u2019s 72-year history. Today, she politely but firmly moves the conversation on: \u201cIt was understandable that it took a lot of space at the time, but now that everybody knows, I think it shouldn\u2019t be a subject any more.\u201d The film won the Grand Prix, the festival\u2019s second most prestigious prize, then last month, at the Toronto film festival, Diop received the inaugural Mary Pickford award recognising outstanding female talent. There, the festival\u2019s artistic director, Cameron Bailey, said: \u201cAtlantics is a profound and unsettling work of art. We know this is just the start for such an original and authentic voice.\u201d Now the film has been selected as the Senegalese entry for next year\u2019s Academy Awards. The reception in Senegal, says Diop, has been \u201cvery, very positive \u2013 people recognised themselves\u201d.\n\nThe Paris-based director, 37, has been making films since 2004. The niece of Senegalese film-maker Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty, for her 2013 documentary, A Thousand Suns, Diop tracked down the lead actor from Mamb\u00e9ty\u2019s 1973 film Touki Bouki. Diop herself has worked as an actor, starring in films including Simon Killer (2012, opposite Brady Corbet) and Claire Denis\u2019s 35 Shots of Rum (2008). Over the years, Denis has become something of a mentor; her influence permeates Diop\u2019s sensual, sensorial shots.\n\nAtlantics is a moving take on the refugee crisis. It is a ghost love story focusing on 17-year-old Ada (Mama Bineta San\u00e9), promised to a wealthy man but in love with construction worker Souleiman (Ibrahima Traor\u00e9), who attempts a fateful journey to Spain; when the boat goes missing, supernatural events envelop the city. \u201cThe ghost dimension was inherent in the situation,\u201d says Diop. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a generation that has disappeared, and that necessarily haunts the living.\u201d The romance between Ada and Souleiman was just as important. \u201cI really wanted to tell a love story. I felt that through this story, it could really become universal, mythical.\u201d\n\nWhat film recently made an impact on you?\n\nThe films of Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho [whose western Bacurau was at Cannes this year].\n\nWho would be your dream actor to work with?\n\nI don\u2019t know him yet. My ideal actor to shoot is somebody I\u2019ve never seen before.\n\nDo you have a role model?\n\nJordan Peele \u2013 he\u2019s a genius and has an incredible political vision.\n\nAtlantics will be in selected cinemas and on Netflix on 29 November\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
