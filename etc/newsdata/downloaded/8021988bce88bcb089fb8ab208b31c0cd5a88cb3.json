The causes were compared with a sample of 23,000 people from the general population.\n\nThe study found that former professional players had a rate of death due to neurodegenerative diseases 3.5 times higher than expected.\n\nEnglish Football Association chairman Greg Clark says \u201cthe whole game must recognize that this is only the start of our understanding and there are many questions that still need to be answered. It is important that the global football family now unites to find the answers and provide a greater understanding of this complex issue.\u201d\n\nWillie Stewart, who led the study, says their analysis showed a five-fold increase in the chance of suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease among soccer players.\n\nBut players were found to be less likely to die of other common diseases, including some cancers.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "British scientists who assessed the causes of death of soccer players have found higher dementia rates that raise fresh concerns about long-term health dangers from playing the sport.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
