That jeopardy has been created by a US blacklist of Chinese artificial intelligence companies implicated in state repression.\n\nWall Street has well-publicised connections with companies such as Megvii. Goldman Sachs is reportedly reviewing its involvement in the proposed flotation of the blacklisted facial recognition group. Megvii is one of eight businesses allegedly providing technology to detention camps, where members of China\u2019s repressed Uighur minority are held.\n\nThere has been little mention so far of US funds whose money helped the companies grow. Disinvestment could hurt these businesses far more than a shortage of US components resulting from the blacklist.\n\nThat list includes AI companies SenseTime and iFlytek. Surveillance companies Hikvision and Dahua are there too. Nvidia, Intel and Qualcomm are among many global partners they source parts from.\n\nBut components for surveillance equipment and servers are relatively low tech. They can easily be sourced elsewhere. A US exports ban does not hit Chinese groups half as badly as the one placed on telecoms equipment company Huawei.", "description": "US universities and pension plans are vociferous advocates of corporate ethics within the US.
