They talk all the time about the returns they are looking to get.\u201d\n\nBrooker is First Eagle Investment Management\u2019s deputy head of global value. Matthew McLennan, who heads the firm\u2019s global value team, is also a portfolio manager for the First Eagle Global Fund SGENX, +0.09%. Manish Gupta serves as associate portfolio manager. The firm has about $102 billion in assets under management.\n\nRead: Worried about the stock market? Here are easy ways to cut risk\n\nTalk of investing risks has reached a fever pitch. We\u2019re reminded daily of the trade conflict between the U.S. and China, the uncertainty over Brexit and what it may mean for the stability of the European Union, and Europe\u2019s anemic economy and the European Central Bank\u2019s ineffectiveness. There is even new military risk to worry about, as evidenced by the recent drone attack against Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities.\n\nYou may have money invested in the benchmark S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.44% through a low-cost index fund within an employer-sponsored retirement plan because performance has been spectacular in the past 10 years. The index is weighted by market capitalization, which means you are not only concentrated in the U.S., you have 17% of your investment in the five companies with the highest market values: Microsoft MSFT, +0.93%, Apple AAPL, +1.39%, Amazon.com AMZN, +0.33%, Alphabet GOOG, +0.82% GOOGL, +0.85% and Facebook FB, -0.01%.\n\nYou might think it reasonable to broaden your horizons with an international index fund \u2014 maybe the iShares MSCI World Index ETF XWD, +0.19% or the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF EFA, +0.23%. (EAFE stands for developed economies in Europe, Australia, Asia and the Far East.)\n\nBut an actively managed approach to international investing, despite higher expenses, might solve the problems of cap-weighting, over-concentration in the U.S. and elevated valuations for many of the largest components of the indexes.\n\nFirst Eagle says its Global Fund is run in an \u201cindex agnostic\u201d manner. However, its performance benchmark is the MSCI World Index. The fund had an 85.8% active share through the second quarter. The higher the active share, the more a fund\u2019s portfolio is differentiated from the index \u2014 and this is a very high active share.\n\nHere\u2019s a 30-year chart showing the performance (after expenses) of the First Eagle Global Fund\u2019s Class A shares against the two international indexes tracked by the ETFs named above, and the S&P 500:\n\nFactSet\n\nThe First Eagle Global Fund\u2019s Class A shares have a 5% sales charge in the fund\u2019s prospectus. That fee is waived at mutual fund \u201csupermarkets,\u201d including Charles Schwab, Fidelity, E-Trade and Ameritrade. The Class A sales charge is not waived for clients on major brokerage platforms. Still, customers with advisory relationships would be directed to the Class I shares, which have no sales charge.\n\nIn the 30-year chart, you can see that the fund performed better than the other three indexes, but was particularly strong against the MSCI World Index.\n\nIn the interview, Brooker said: \u201cWhat you don\u2019t own in a portfolio can be more helpful than what you own. A lot of times [during severe market declines] when we were not exposed to certain parts of the market, those were well-represented in the index.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cOne of the dangers of relying too much on indices ... is you end up owning, typically, the most popular segments of a given market, which can sometimes be overpriced as a group.\u201d\n\nAccording to First Eagle, the Global Fund\u2019s exposure to the technology sector was less than 5% at the end of 1999, while the MSCI World Index was 32.5% concentrated in the sector. As of Dec. 31, 2006, the fund had less than 2% exposure to financial stocks, compared with 26.4% for the index.\n\nThe 30-year chart, of course, encompasses the full dot-com boom-and-bust cycle, as well as the 2008-2009 financial crisis and recovery.\n\nGoing all the way back to January 1979, First Eagle provided these upside/downside capture numbers through 2018:\n\nFirst Eagle Global Fund - upside capture First Eagle Global Fund - downside capture MSCI World Index 72% 42% MSCI EAFE Index 50% 28% S&P 500 67% 42% Source: First Eagle Investment Management\n\nThe 20-year chart shows the fund again outperforming greatly:\n\nFactSet\n\nFor 15 years, the fund trails the S&P 500 but is still ahead of the two international indexes:\n\nFactSet\n\nSo the fund has trailed the recent period of fantastic growth for so many of the largest U.S. tech companies.\n\nHere are average returns for the fund against the indexes for various periods:\n\nTotal return - 2019 through Sept. 20 Average return - 5 years Average return - 10 years Average return - 15 years Average return - 20 years Average return - 30 years First Eagle Global Fund 15.5% 5.3% 7.7% 8.5% 10.2% 10.0% MSCI World Index 19.6% 8.7% 10.5% 7.9% 5.3% 7.0% MSCI EAFE Index 16.5% 6.3% 7.5% 6.4% 4.1% 4.6% S&P 500 Index 21.1% 10.5% 13.2% 9.0% 6.1% 9.8% Source: FactSet\n\nFor the longer periods, some of the differences between the average returns may seem small, but you can see on the first chart that these differences really add up over long periods.\n\nPortfolio and selection\n\nAs of July 31, the First Eagle Global Fund was 14.7% in cash and equivalents. McLennan, who heads the firm\u2019s global value team, said during a meeting Sept. 17 that the fund\u2019s current positioning reflected its \u201ccounter-cyclical\u201d approach to cash \u2014 building it up when market valuations are elevated (with the S&P 500 near its record high) and deploying cash when valuations are low.\n\nHere are the fund\u2019s top 10 investing positions as of July 31:\n\nName Ticker Share of portfolio Country Industry Gold bullion 9.6% Oracle Corp. ORCL 2.4% U.S. Software Comcast Corp. Class A CMCSA 2.0% U.S. Cable/Satellite TV Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM 1.8% U.S. Integrated Oil Schlumberger NV SLB 1.6% U.S. Oilfield Services/Equipment Fanuc Corp. 6954-JP 1.5% Japan Industrial Machinery Weyerhaeuser Co.

When discussing gold, McLennan said developed economies have been growing their money supply more rapidly than GDP, while the supply of gold grows slowly, underlining its value as a hedge.\n\n\u201cWe have about 150 securities in the fund,\u201d Brooker said. \u201cIt is very diversified. We really are not believers in the concentration mantra.\u201d\n\nSo the heavy representation of the U.S. in the above list of top holdings isn\u2019t especially meaningful. Here\u2019s the fund\u2019s breakdown by region as of July 31:\n\nMarketWatch Illustration. Data source: First Eagle Investment Management.\n\nBrooker said First Eagle\u2019s bottom-up approach to stock selection emphasizes valuation, quality and something less tangible: the long-term durability of each company\u2019s business: \u201cEither the over-valuation or the lack of quality keeps us out of the companies that usually get themselves in the most trouble during a downturn,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen the managers make a selection, First Eagle\u2019s average holding period for a stock is about 10 years, he said.\n\nTwo examples\n\nBrooker named two companies held by the First Eagle Global Fund as examples that meet the valuation, quality and durability criteria:\n\nBank of New York Mellon BK, -0.02% is technically a bank, but very much focused on fee-based services that act as \u201cWall Street plumbing,\u201d Brooker said. These include various investment services and management businesses. Brooker called the stock\u2019s valuation \u201ccompelling.\u201d According to FactSet, the stock is trading for 11.4 times consensus earnings estimates for the next 12 months, compared with average forward price-to-earnings ratios of 13 over the past five years.\n\nBrooker said the bank\u2019s returns on average tangible equity have been \u201cquite good.\u201d Looking at data provided by FactSet for the 24 components of the KBW Bank Index BKX, -0.03%, Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s returns on average tangible common equity have ranged from 22.78% to 27.35% over the past four quarters. None of the other components of the benchmark U.S. banking index have come close to that performance. However, the low figure is for the second quarter, showing how declining interest rates have lowered the bank\u2019s returns.\n\nThe other example was Groupe Bruxelles Lambert GBLB, +0.32% GBLBY, +1.67% of Belgium, which \u201cholds half a dozen blue-chip companies,\u201d Brooker said, and is controlled by the Fr\u00e8re and Desmarais families.\n\n\u201cWe have a bias toward family-owned or controlled businesses \u2014 they have longer time frames. They care about their reputations and tend not to do things that are too risky or short-sighted,\u201d Brooker said.\n\nCompanies that Groupe Bruxelles Lambert holds stakes in range from Pernod Ricard RI, +0.55% to Adidas ADS, +0.84%. GBLB, +0.32%\n\nDon\u2019t miss: How to profit from the \u2018best of both worlds\u2019 in stock investing\n\nCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn\u2019s Deep Dive columns here.", "description": "\u2018What you don\u2019t own in a portfolio can be more helpful than what you own,\u2019 says Kimball Brooker of the $50 billion First Eagle Global Fund.", "authors": ["Philip Van Doorn", "Investing Columnist"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR902_pernod_ZG_20190923154814.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
