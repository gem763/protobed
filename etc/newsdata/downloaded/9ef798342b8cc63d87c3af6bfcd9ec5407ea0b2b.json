We were trying to kill her,\" Morgan said, Detective Casey recalled.\n\n\"I figured that I'd get into trouble eventually, though, because mommy always says that whatever you do catches up to you eventually, and it did.\"\n\n(Image: Rex)\n\n(Image: ABC America)\n\nAnissa went on to tell Detective Michelle Trussoni how she had become afraid of Slender Man - a tall, suited character without a face - through a website that collects horror stories.\n\nShe became convinced the ghostly figure was real after seeing him, she believed, while on a bus ride.\n\nThe girl told Detective Trussoni that it was \"really scary\" to think that Slender Man could kill her whole family in three seconds.\n\nAll pupils at the same school, Morgan and Anissa thought they had come up with the plan for the perfect murder.\n\n(Image: Waukesha Police Department)\n\n(Image: ABC America)\n\nThey had invited Payton to a sleepover and originally planned to stab her that night - but couldn't go through with it.\n\nInstead, the following day, they grabbed a kitchen knife from home and set off for the woods.\n\nAfter playing for some time, they started a game of hide and seek and when Payton was crouching down, they pounced.\n\nShe was pinned down and as she stabbed her friend multiple times in a frenzied attack, Geyser shouted: \"Don\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019m only a little kitty cat.\"\n\nBefore the girls fled the scene they told Payton they were going to get help.\n\nIn her police interview Anissa said: \"So, we told her we we\u2019re gonna get help, but we really weren\u2019t. We were going to run and let her - pass away.\"\n\n(Image: Rex)\n\nAfter she was found and rushed to hospital by ambulance, Payton told police the shocking story of what had happened to her.\n\nHorrified detectives then launched a search to find the two missing girls.\n\nMorgan and Anissa had set off to the Nicolet National Forest, where they believed Slender Man's castle was located.\n\nThe girls were found several miles away - they had taken some fruit sticks with them in case they got hungry and needed the energy.\n\nWhen investigators scoured the girls' belongings, uncovering a cache of drawings of the spooky character in Morgan's locker and her bedroom.\n\n(Image: Waukesha Police Department)\n\nShe also had mutilated dolls in her possession.\n\nPsychiatrists later diagnosed her with early onset schizophrenia.\n\nBoth girls are now 17-years-old and are being held at the Winnebago Mental Health Institute in Wisconsin.\n\nThey must serve at least three years in locked confinement at the psychiatric institute.\n\nPayton left hospital seven days after the attack and returned to school in 2014.", "description": "A detective has spoken of his first interview with Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier after they were arrested on suspicion of stabbing their friend Payton Leutner", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Rex", "Abc America", "Waukesha Police Department"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article3951190.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Morgan-Geyser-mugshot.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
