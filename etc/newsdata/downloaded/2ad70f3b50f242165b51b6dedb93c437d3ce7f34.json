It was a poor game to be honest, wasn\u2019t entertaining, lots of kicking.\n\n'Boys right in mix until the end, shame they couldn\u2019t get over the line.'\n\n'They will learn from this experience and move on.'\n\n\ud83d\udde3 \"Congratulations to South Africa.

England will be a tough nut to crack... but rather them than the @AllBlacks! #RWC2019 #WALvRSA \u2014 Rick Duvenage (@RickDuvenage) October 27, 2019\n\nSome effort considering the strength that we couldn\u2019t put on the pitch. A semi-final is probably a fair reflection of this World Cup. Never quite hit the heights. \u2014 George Dugdale (@GeorgeDugdale) October 27, 2019\n\nBryan Habana added: 'From what was a dour first half to a second half that had more to it. The six forwards who came on made a really impact.\n\n'They\u2019ll take this one on the head, enjoy it tonight, preparation will start early tomorrow.'\n\nGareth Thomas: 'I think they\u2019ve put everything the line. It was a tough battle, they couldn\u2019t have done anymore.'", "description": "Retired scrum-half Mike Phillips admits he felt for Wales after they missed out on the Rugby World Cup final with a 19-16 defeat by South Africa.", "authors": ["James Ayles For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/11/20241732-0-image-a-3_1572176005886.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
