But after undergoing a \u201clife-changing\u201d hip resurfacing surgery, the former world number one slowly made his way back to the court. Today, Tennis Australia announced his place in the 2020 Oz Open. Hell yes.\n\nMurray crashed out of this year\u2019s Australian Open after a first round lost to Robert Bautista Agut. The five-time runner up told reporters afterwards: \u201cThe pain is too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I think there\u2019s a chance [the Australian Open 2019 would be his last tournament]. Like I said, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m able to play through the pain, you know, for another four or five months.\u201d\n\nAfter undergoing surgery, Murray kicked off his comeback campaign in June by playing doubles in a couple of lil\u2019 tournaments. He recently reached the quarter-finals of the China Open, his first since returning to the court, but lost to Dominic Thiem (World No. 5).\n\nMurray just beat Argentina\u2019s Juan Ignacio Londero in his first round match at the Shanghai Open, after accepting a wildcard entry. He beat Londero 2-6, 6-2, 6-3.\n\nThe three-time Grand Slam winner is now ranked 289th in the world.\n\nSide note: the caption always gets me.\n\nMurray aside, Tennis Australia recently announced a new tournament to be hosted across Perth, Brisbane, and Sydney in 2020.\n\n24 countries will compete in the ATP Cup, with different stages of the competition hosted across the three cities.\n\nThe big three, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, and Roger Federer, are all locked in to play at the Cup. As are Thiem (Team Austria), Alexander Zverev (Germany), Stefanos Tsitsipas (Team Greece), Kei Nishikori (Team Japan), Fabio Fognini (Team Italy), and Gael Monfils (Team France).\n\nAlso, Andy Murray will compete for Team Great Britain!", "description": "Less than a year after he thought he would have to retire from tennis due to injury, Andy Murray has confirmed his place in the Australian Open.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1094221336-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
