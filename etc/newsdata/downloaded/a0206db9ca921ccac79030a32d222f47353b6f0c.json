Many were murdered in its gas chamber while others succumbed to hunger, sickness and exhaustion.\n\nDescendents of survivors were expected to fill the court's public galleries.\n\nProsecutors argue that as a guard he was an accessory to murder through the act of stopping inmates escaping from the camp, which was one of the last to be liberated in 1945.\n\nBroadcaster NDR reported there are around 29 open cases in Germany against people accused of being involved in the Holocaust, in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime murdered more than 6 million Jews.
