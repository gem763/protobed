(Photo: Richard Drew, AP)\n\nStocks marched higher on Wall Street Friday afternoon, riding investor optimism that the U.S. and China can make progress in their punishing trade war.\n\nThe broad rally drove the Dow Jones Industrial Average more than 470 points higher and had the S&P 500 index on track to close out its first weekly gain in four weeks.\n\nBefore meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He for trade talks at the White House, President Donald Trump said, \u201cGood things are happening.\u201d Investors are hopeful the two sides can reach at least a limited deal on trade and tamp down tensions that have already dragged down manufacturing around the world.\n\nBank fees: Stop stressing about lattes. It's bank fees that cost you money.\n\nCar shopping: When's the right time to replace your clunker with a new or lightly used car?\n\nOne set of U.S. tariffs is scheduled to rise on Chinese products next week, and another round of tariffs is scheduled to take effect in December. The worry is that all the uncertainty about global trade may spill over into stronger areas of the economy, such as household spending, and cause a recession.\n\n\u201cThe market is looking for anything here that shows forward progress,\u201d said Ben Phillips, chief investment officer at EventShares. \u201cIf we get there, that\u2019s enough for the market to say, \u2018OK, we\u2019re moving in the right direction and this isn\u2019t going to be a disaster that stops the global expansion.\u2019\u201d\n\nTreasury yields rose as investors felt less need for safety and dumped bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, a benchmark for mortgages and many other kinds of loans, jumped to 1.74% from 1.65% late Thursday, a big move.\n\nThe jump in yields helped send bank stocks higher on expectations of bigger profits for making loans. JPMorgan Chase rose 2.7%, and Bank of America climbed 2.5%.\n\nTechnology stocks, which often do lots of business with China, also helped power the indexes higher. Apple climbed 2.8%, and Broadcom added 3.1%.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 index was up 1.7%, as of 3 p.m. Eastern time. Earlier it had been up 1.9%. The Dow climbed 474 points, or 1.8%, to 26,971 after earlier being up nearly 500 points.\n\nThe Nasdaq rose 2%. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks outpaced the broader market with a 2.6% gain.\n\nTAMPING DOWN TRADE TENSIONS: Markets around the world have swung sharply on every morsel of progress or dissonance dribbling out about the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nAny breakthrough on trade would mark a sharp turnaround from expectations earlier this week when the U.S. blacklisted a group of Chinese technology companies over alleged human rights violations. China has since signaled that it is open to making even a partial deal.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the base case is a truce or a pause for a moment on tariffs,\u201d Phillips said.\n\nThe Trump administration has already raised tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports, but the stakes have grown. If tariff increases scheduled for this upcoming Tuesday and December go through, they would cover nearly everything China ships to the United States.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/11/stock-market-dow-s-p-upswing-amid-us-china-trade-optimism/3946537002/", "description": "Optimism on Wall Street that the U.S. and China would abate their trade war and possibly lessen tariffs led to higher stocks on Friday.", "authors": ["Alex Veiga", "Stan Choe", "Associated Press", "Published P.M.
