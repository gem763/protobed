Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you'll find our analysis useful.\n\nA slim 0.4% yield is hard to get excited about, but the long payment history is respectable. At the right price, or with strong growth opportunities, Poddar Housing and Development could have potential. Some simple analysis can offer a lot of insights when buying a company for its dividend, and we'll go through this below.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nNSEI:PODDARHOUS Historical Dividend Yield, October 30th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Although it reported a loss over the past 12 months, Poddar Housing and Development currently pays a dividend. When a company is loss-making, we next need to check to see if its cash flows can support the dividend.\n\nLast year, Poddar Housing and Development paid a dividend while reporting negative free cash flow. While there may be an explanation, we think this behaviour is generally not sustainable.\n\nRemember, you can always get a snapshot of Poddar Housing and Development's latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Poddar Housing and Development's dividend payments. The dividend has been stable over the past 10 years, which is great. We think this could suggest some resilience to the business and its dividends. Its most recent annual dividend was \u20b91.50 per share, effectively flat on its first payment ten years ago.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. Over the past five years, it looks as though Poddar Housing and Development's EPS have declined at around 50% a year. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective, as even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Poddar Housing and Development's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. It's a concern to see that the company paid a dividend despite reporting a loss, and the dividend was also not well covered by free cash flow. Second, earnings per share have actually shrunk, but at least the dividends have been relatively stable. In this analysis, Poddar Housing and Development doesn't shape up too well as a dividend stock. We'd find it hard to look past the flaws, and would not be inclined to think of it as a reliable dividend-payer.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could Poddar Housing and Development Limited (NSE:PODDARHOUS) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/b1mpzpmyxPf0Jroaemc3JA--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/dc9528487b43945f684b44889e95144f", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
