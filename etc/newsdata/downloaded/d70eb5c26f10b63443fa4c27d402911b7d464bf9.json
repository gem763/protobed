Sales in the category are expected to nearly double by 2024 to $8.1 billion, according to a report from Wintergreen Research.\n\nSo, what\u2019s next? A line of cold-pressed juices geared for the craft cocktail crowd, of course.\n\nThat\u2019s the thought behind Twisted Alchemy, a brand that started in 2016 (originally, it was called Industry Juice). It\u2019s the brainchild of Kim and Scott Holstein, food-and-drink-loving entrepreneurs who previously developed Kim and Scott\u2019s Gourmet Pretzels, a brand the couple sold everywhere from Whole Foods AMZ, +0.64% to QVC. The story goes that one night the couple was preparing a big batch of margaritas with fresh lime juice and they got tired of squeezing the fruit. \u201cWe needed a solution to create the fresh-squeezed taste but without all the hours of work,\u201d says Kim Holstein. Twisted Alchemy was born.\n\nThe brand has grown to encompass several varieties \u2014 not just lime, but also key lime, lemon, grapefruit, watermelon, pineapple orange and even blood orange. Sales were up a remarkable 538% in 2018, Kim Holstein notes.\n\nThe couple is largely targeting Twisted Alchemy at bars and restaurants and says the products are also popular with spirits brands at special events and cocktail-making classes. But consumers can partake as well \u2014 the juices can be ordered online for direct shipping.\n\nWhat we think about it: There\u2019s no question this is quality juice \u2014 the flavors truly pop (we\u2019re very partial to the lime and orange). We also like that the juice has a long-shelf life (at least 90 days), thanks to a process the brand uses that preserves the liquid without utilizing pasteurization, which can kill the taste. The only negative? The juice is very pricey, as is typically the case with cold-pressed products. A six-pack of various flavors sells for $93 directly from the company.\n\nHow to enjoy it: In cocktails, naturally! But if money is not an issue, the juice can certainly be had on its own. It also works well in alcohol-free cocktails (aka mocktails). And Kim Holstein says the lemon juice can be had in the morning as a wake-up for the digestive system.", "description": "Twisted Alchemy brand has seen remarkable sales growth.", "authors": ["Charles Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ474_twiste_ZG_20190830090636.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-30"}
