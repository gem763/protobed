Only three days after her shocking loss in the U.S. Open final, Serena Williams went from the court to the runway to present the latest collection of her fashion label, S by Serena.\n\nAnd she brought her baby daughter along for the ride: As she made her traditional post-show bow, wearing a snakeskin-style miniskirt that she designed, she was carrying little Olympia, 2, in her arms.\n\nAs befitting a tennis legend, Williams had some prominent fans in attendance, notably Kim Kardashian, TV host Gayle King, and Vogue editor Anna Wintour.\n\nAlso attending: #MeToo movement founder Tarana Burke, who said Williams was \u201cstrong in so many ways, not just physically. I\u2019ll always support her.\u201d\n\nThe runway show in midtown Manhattan began with a lush brown trench-style coat, followed by a suit in the same fabric with an asymmetrical wrap skirt. Pants and slouchy sweaters followed, then a series of dresses, tops and coats in an animal-style print.\n\nThe 37-year-old Williams showed herself to be a fan of bold prints, in hues like purple or bright blue, or in black and white. And she is also clearly partial to bright colors, as in one hot pink ensemble that was part midriff-baring pantsuit, part long skirt.\n\nBut perhaps the most striking and creative sight on the runway came when two models wore the same outfit together, side by side, one in a plus size and one not - an effective statement about size diversity.\n\nWilliams noted later on the red carpet that she her intention was \u201cto show diversity of all colors and all backgrounds and all sizes - just beautiful women.\u201d\n\nBurke praised Williams\u2019 runway for being truly diverse. \u201cI love Serena,\u201d she said, adding that fashion is \u201canother world for her to conquer.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Talk about a quick recovery.
