The lawyer\u2019s statement calls the lawsuit a \u201cmoney grab.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will pursue all legal remedies to not only clear his name, but also to protect other professional athletes against false accusations,\u201d Heitner vows.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIn the statement, Heitner characterizes Taylor as someone who was looking for funding from Brown to launch a business project. She allegedly sought $1.6 million.\n\n\u201cWhen Mr. Brown refused to make the $1.6 million \u2018investment,\u2019 the accuser supposedly cut off communication with Mr. Brown,\u201d Heitner contends. \u201cHowever, in 2018, the accuser resurfaced and offered to travel to Pennsylvania and South Florida to train Mr. Brown for the upcoming season. Thereafter, the accuser engaged Mr. Brown in a consensual personal relationship. Any sexual interaction with Mr. Brown was entirely consensual.\u201d\n\nHeitner claims that the relationship continued after the alleged rape in May 2018.\n\n\u201cMr. Brown\u2019s accuser has continually posted photographs of Mr. Brown on her social media in an effort to financially benefit from his celebrity,\u201d Heitner writes. \u201cMr. Brown, whose hard work and decision to his craft has allowed him to rise to the top of his profession, refuses to be the victim of what he believes to be a money grab.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe statement narrows the focus of much of the looming legal fight to the credibility of Brown and Taylor, since it\u2019s clear that they knew each other and had a personal relationship. While third-party witnesses and circumstantial evidence may tip the scales one way or the other, this one will (barring a settlement) boil down to whether a jury believes him or believes her.\n\nWhile that may not be enough to ever secure a conviction in criminal court, it\u2019s more than enough to satisfy the much lower burden of proof in civil cases.", "description": "On the same day he became a member of the Patriots, receiver Antonio Brown has been sued for sexual assault and rape.
