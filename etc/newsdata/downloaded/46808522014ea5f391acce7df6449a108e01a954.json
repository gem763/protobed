Back then, Tezos was the ICO which raised the highest amount of funds.\n\nDecentralization On The Whole\n\n\u201cTezos, as a project, doesn\u2019t just pay lip service to decentralization and isn\u2019t just decentralized in terms of our validators, stakers or bakers,\u201d Mangiero said on a recent interview with CryptoPotato. \u201cThe entities that work on Tezos are also decentralized.\u201d\n\nDiving into the concept a bit further, Mangiero explained the Zug-based (Switzerland) Tezos Foundation \u201chouses\n\nthe funds from the original Tezos Foundation fundraiser.\u201d Its mission, she noted, \u201cIs to deploy those funds to support the Tezos ecosystem.\u201d Everyday activities for the Foundation include providing grants to various players, as well as supporting entities working to help the Tezos project via multiple methods, Mangiero said. The New York-based TQ is one such entity.\n\nRegarding TQ, Mangiero said they \u201cfocus on business development, technical services, communications and marketing, and advocacy work.\u201d\n\nThe TQ president also mentioned the Paris-based Nomadic Labs. \u201cThey are one of the teams working on the core protocol,\u201d she explained. Mangiero clarified that many teams work on the Tezos protocol globally, and \u201csome of the original architects of Tezos are now housed in Nomadic Labs in Paris.\u201d Additionally, she mentioned several other involved groups worldwide, including Tezos Japan, Tezos Korea, Tezos Southeast Asia, and others.\n\nRecent Tezos News\n\nSpeaking on recent developments for Tezos, Mangiero spoke about the very first Tezos upgrade, Athens, which has been in the works over the past several months, beginning in January 2019. \u201cOne of the key differentiators of Tezos is that the protocol can upgrade itself,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a self-amending ledger, meaning it incorporates a formal, on-chain mechanism for proposing, selecting, testing, and activating protocol upgrades, which come directly from the community, without the need to hard fork.\u201d\n\nMangiero added, \u201cThe first amendments to the protocol were proposed in January [2019].\u201d The proposed changes apply to the area of baking (staking for Tezos), and the minimum number of tokens needed to own a roll (similar to a master node) in order to be able to bake.\n\nPrior to the discussed upgrade, users desiring to bake would need a roll consisting of 10,000 XTZ coins, Mangiero explained. January\u2019s proposal included lowering the required roll size, from 10,000 down to 8,000, as well as proposed alterations to gas limits, the TQ president noted.\n\nThe community showed voting support in favor of decreasing the roll requirement, Mangiero said. \u201cWe are nearing the end of the exploratory period now, and by the end of May, assuming the proposal reaches quorum, that change will be made automatically,\u201d she explained. \u201cThis is an important moment because it will prove that the protocol is capable of upgrading itself,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019ve known that it worked in theory, but this will be the first time the Tezos protocol will actually have done that.\u201d\n\nMangiero also clarified, \u201d a roughly 80% supermajority is the threshold for a quorum.\u201d This essentially means at least 80% of bakers voting must approve the upgrade for the changes to take place.\u201d\n\nBe the first to know about our price analysis, crypto news and trading tips: Follow us on Telegram or subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\n\n", "description": "Tezos is a notable open-source project in the crypto space, which applies decentralization to its overall model, instead of simply touting decentralization, according to\u00a0Alison Mangiero, president of The Tocqueville Group (TQ Tezos).", "authors": ["Benjamin Pirus", "View All Posts Benjamin Pirus", "About The Author", "Benjamin Bj Pirus", "Bj Is A Full Time Writer", "Editor", "Trader In The Cryptocurrency Space.
