Sideways passer. Short-ball merchant. Assist dodger. Frontrunner for the Premier League's unofficial Donkey of the Year award.\n\nJorginho was called all sorts in his first season at Chelsea. Even his own fans jeered him, apparently because he was a teacher's pet and cheerleader for 'Sarri-ball'.\n\nHow times have changed. Where once the sight of Jorginho on the front of the \u00a33.50 programme might have prompted jokes about pricy toilet paper, he is now celebrated.\n\nJorginho is now celebrated at Chelsea working under new manager Frank Lampard\n\nIn the 87th minute on Saturday, after an afternoon of producing probing passes against a resolute Newcastle side, it was Jorginho's name that the supporters chose to sing. A starter in every game under new coach Frank Lampard, bar the EFL Cup win over Grimsby Town, he is now Chelsea's vice-captain and anchorman.\n\nHe is creating more chances per game. He is passing less \u2014 which isn't a bad thing \u2014 and when he does get the ball, he looks forwards rather than sideways or backwards.\n\nAt half-time, with the score 0-0, the buzzword for Lampard's team talk was 'patience'. He told his players to keep moving the ball between the lines, mix it up, use Jorginho.\n\nThe Italian midfielder is now Chelsea's vice-captain and anchorman under Lampard\n\nThey listened, and Chelsea got the win that takes them into the Premier League's top four for the first time under Lampard.\n\nThe young guns around Jorginho did their jobs, too. Callum Hudson-Odoi was particularly lively, while only an outstanding goal-line clearance by DeAndre Yedlin denied Tammy Abraham a goal.\n\nNewcastle, on the other hand, did not manage a single shot on target and Steve Bruce admitted they need to work on making themselves a threat.\n\nOn this occasion, they put up a brick wall and it took the wicked left foot of Marcos Alonso to break it down. 'Before the game we prepared ourselves,' said Abraham of Newcastle's tactics. 'I worked under Steve Bruce myself. He loves his team to be compact and hard to beat.'\n\nChelsea's Tammy Abraham has hailed the influence of Olivier Giroud for his development\n\nAbraham will continue to keep Olivier Giroud out of the team, and Lampard has promised he will speak with the Frenchman ahead of the January transfer window.\n\n'I look at Ollie like an older brother,' Abraham said. 'I'm always learning from him on the training pitch and I've grown up watching him. I'm a visual learner. I like to watch and take people's ideas. Ollie is obviously not the fastest striker in the world, but what he has is unbelievable. His one-touch play, his hold-up play. He's always supporting me.'\n\nNext up for Chelsea is a Champions League trip to Ajax, another team whose youngsters have been celebrated recently. This will be a real test for Lampard's kids. Keeping the ball and what they do with it will be key. That is where Jorginho comes in. Thankfully, he is now looking like the \u00a350million footballer they signed last year.", "description": "Maurizio Sarri's son. Sideways passer. Short-ball merchant. Assist dodger.
