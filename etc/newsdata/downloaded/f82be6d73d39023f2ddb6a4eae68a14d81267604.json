USA TODAY\n\nYou've got to hand it to Gary Oldman. Even when he's stuck in a dopey low-budget horror yarn like \"Mary,\" he never phones it in. He sweats, scowls and screams like he really believes he's starring in something worth all the effort.\n\nIt's certainly to his credit, even though all the heavy lifting in the world can't add much heft to this anorexic little ghost story. Speaking of heavy-lifting, \"Mary\" (\u2605\u00bd out of five; rated R; in theaters Friday in New York, Los Angeles and other major markets, on demand and digital HD) also features Emily Mortimer, who is frequently wonderful in other projects, and the charismatic Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, who is always worth watching. They also bend over backward trying to make us care about what's going on, and they just can't manage it.\n\nFall movie preview: 10 movies you absolutely, positively must see (from 'It 2' to 'Joker')\n\nMust-see horror: 10 terrifying movies you'll want to see this October, from 'Addams Family' to 'Zombieland'\n\nThe voyage is about to begin in \"Mary\" for Mike (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, from left), Sarah (Emily Mortimer), David (Gary Oldman), Mary (Chloe Perrin) and Lindsey (Stefanie Scott). (Photo: RLJE Films)\n\nOldman plays David, a down-on-his luck sea captain who becomes strangely enamored with a mysterious vessel that the Coast Guard found abandoned. It's a little hard to understand his fascination with the beat-up ship, because it's frankly unexceptional. There is, however, a rather lifelike carving of a woman on the ship's masthead. And if you think that means anything, you're about five steps ahead of the characters.\n\nDavid wins the ship, named Mary, at auction with the intention of turning it into a tourist boat. His wife, Sarah (Mortimer), disapproves, but soon they're at sea for its maiden voyage, along with their two daughters, hunky shipmate Mike (Garcia-Rulfo) and a young apprentice who's obviously not long for this world.\n\nDirector Michael Goi is big on jump shocks that get increasingly tiresome. They also seem at odds with the film's concept, which essentially involves everyone on board slowly being driven mad by unseen forces. Despite the \"unseen\" portion of that equation, things and people still manage to seemingly pop out of nowhere every few minutes.\n\nThe Anthony Jaswinski screenplay, besides giving the actors no characters whatsoever to play, is also overly familiar. Of course, the family's youngest daughter begins talking with a friend no one else can see and using her crayons to create weirdly violent pictures. But, hey, let's journey on!\n\nBetter yet: Don't get on the boat to start with.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/10/review-mary-wastes-gary-oldman-silly-ghost-story/3936048002/", "description": "In 'Mary,' a great cast \u2014 Gary Oldman, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo and Emily Mortimer \u2014 wastes its time in a horror film set on a ship at sea.", "authors": ["Randy Cordova", "Published P.M.
