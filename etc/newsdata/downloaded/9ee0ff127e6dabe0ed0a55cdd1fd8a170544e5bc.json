Greta Gerwig\u2019s Lady Bird follow-up had its first big screenings this week, and early viewers agree that the Louisa May Alcott adaptation could make a capital addition to the race. \u201cEach role perfectly cast. Rousing score. Timely as ever. Hard not to cheer,\u201d THR\u2019s Scott Feinberg tweeted . With Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and The Irishman dominating pundits\u2019 predictions, and 1917 and Ford v Ferrari looming, 2019\u2019s Best Picture crop was looking very masc.
