Ms. Westerhout\u2019s abrupt and unexpected departure came after Mr. Trump learned on Thursday that she had indiscreetly shared details about his family and the Oval Office operations she was part of during a recent off-the-record dinner with reporters staying at hotels near Bedminster, N.J., during the president\u2019s working vacation, according to one of the people, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss White House personnel issues.\n\n\u201cThe breach of trust meant immediate action: Ms. Westerhout, one of the people familiar with her departure said, was immediately considered a \u2018separated employee\u2019 and would not be allowed to return to the White House on Friday,\u201d Haberman and Karni added.\n\nWesterhout was a staple in the West Wing, with a desk right outside the Oval Office and having control over much of who got in to speak with the president in person or over the phone and a lot of which papers made it to him and which did not. When it turned out she was allegedly leaking, as the Times noted, she was reportedly immediately terminated and told not to return to the White House. She was an aide to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, now a Utah U.S. senator after carpetbagging his way out West last cycle when he bowed out of running for Senate against Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in Massachusetts during his 2012 presidential campaign. She also served at the Republican National Committee (RNC) and in various other roles throughout the party before joining the Trump White House in the beginning of the administration.\n\nIt is still unclear exactly what specific information that Westerhout allegedly leaked that led to her termination. But one new detail has emerged in the half-day since her departure from the West Wing that is raising eyebrows around Washington: a plausible theory as to who burned her.\n\nArthur Schwartz, a highly plugged-in GOP strategist, has tweeted that multiple reporters and White House officials have told him that Rucker\u2013the Post\u2019s White House bureau chief\u2013is who shared the off-the-record information that Westerhout supposedly provided with someone else, before it then got back to the White House what Westerhout was allegedly doing:\n\nI\u2019ve heard from two reporters that @PhilipRucker is the one that burned Madeleine Westerhout. A couple of people in the WH told me the same. \u2014 Arthur Schwartz (@ArthurSchwartz) August 30, 2019\n\nSchwartz, about whom the New York Times just wrote regarding his role as a Trump ally in an effort to expose media figures\u2019 histories of racism, antisemitism, bigotry, and other embarrassing comments, said it is clear from what he says about Rucker\u2019s behavior here that \u201coff-the-record\u201d is now \u201cmeaningless\u201d:\n\n\u201cOff the record\u201d is now officially meaningless. https://t.co/lDHWLUqM3V \u2014 Arthur Schwartz (@ArthurSchwartz) August 30, 2019\n\nSchwartz also said there should be serious consequences for Rucker for his behavior on this matter:\n\nHey @PhilipRucker. Sharing info that you were given off the record should end your career. Thoughts and prayers, pal. \u2014 Arthur Schwartz (@ArthurSchwartz) August 30, 2019\n\nRucker has not replied to multiple emailed requests for comment from Breitbart News on this matter. He also has not said if he was at the dinner with Westerhout, if Westerhout did share \u201coff-the-record\u201d information with him and others there, and if he then provided said information to others who then relayed back to the White House what both he and Westerhout were doing.\n\nIf true, this would be a violation of the Washington Post\u2019s published standards regarding handling of \u201coff-the-record\u201d dealings with sources.\n\nThe Post\u2019s published guidelines on \u201coff-the-record\u201d information are as follows:\n\nOff the record: This is the trickiest of all, because so many people misuse the term. By the traditional definition, off-the-record information cannot be used for publication or in further reporting. But many sources, including some sophisticated officials, use the term when they really mean \u201cnot for attribution to me.\u201d We must be very careful when dealing with sources who say they want to be \u201coff the record.\u201d If they mean \u201cnot for attribution to me,\u201d we need to explain the difference, and discuss what the attribution will actually be. If they really mean off the record as the term is traditionally defined, then in most circumstances, we should avoid listening to such information at all. We do not want to be hamstrung by a source who tells us something that becomes unusable because it is provided on an off-the-record basis. A source may be willing to give us information for our guidance or to prompt further reporting, on the understanding that we will not use his or her comments as the basis for publication.\n\nAlso if true, the Post could be latest in what seems like an endless line of establishment media outlets dealing with ethics issues\u2013the New York Times has been hit with one of its own over the past week-plus, and CNN has had serious problems over the past month\u2013the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association (WHCA) seems more distracted in helping someone from Playboy magazine who threatened violence at the White House get back his press credentials:\n\nWhere the hell is the @whca on the Amazon Washington Post / @PhilipRucker scandal? They\u2019re busy defending a Playboy columnist\u2019s right to behave like a buffoon at the WH instead of addressing an unprecedented credibility crisis facing their entire profession. Shameful. \u2014 Arthur Schwartz (@ArthurSchwartz) August 30, 2019\n\nThe WHCA just this week signed onto a lawsuit by Brian Karem, Playboy\u2019s White House correspondent, to try to overturn a White House-issued temporary ban on his press credential, which came after he threatened to engage in physical violence against radio host and former White House aide Dr. Sebastian Gorka at a Rose Garden event this summer. After Karem\u2019s threats of violence, the White House issued a temporary suspension of his press credentials\u2013which Karem has sued to overturn, a lawsuit the WHCA signed onto.\n\nBut the WHCA remains silent on actual racism and antisemitism inside the New York Times and inside CNN. It now remains silent on what appears to be a serious breach of journalistic ethics from the Washington Post. It remains silent on threats of violence from CNN primetime weeknight anchor Chris Cuomo, who was caught on tape threatening a man who jokingly called him \u201cFredo.\u201d They remain silent on CNN\u2019s April Ryan\u2019s bodyguard\u2019s physical attack on a reporter this month who was trying to cover a speech she gave in New Jersey. It remains silent on CNN anchor Don Lemon being credibly accused of sexual assault in a bar in the Hamptons. It remains silent on an MSNBC anchor pushing false information about the president\u2019s finances that he was forced to retract the next night in an embarrassing public retraction and apology. It remains silent on a Miami Herald columnist publishing what has been denounced as antisemitism when he labeled a Jewish conservative a \u201ctermite.\u201d But the WHCA has the time and energy to defend threats of violence from a Playboy magazine writer:\n\nWhere the hell is the @whca on the Amazon Washington Post / @PhilipRucker scandal? They\u2019re busy defending a Playboy columnist\u2019s right to behave like a buffoon at the WH instead of addressing an unprecedented credibility crisis facing their entire profession. Shameful. \u2014 Arthur Schwartz (@ArthurSchwartz) August 30, 2019\n\nCNN, Washington Post, NY Times and MSNBC have all been hit with major scandals in recent weeks \u2014 ranging from serious breaches of basic rules of journalism to overt anti-Semitism and other forms of hate & bigotry. Number of people fired: Zero#EnemyOfThePeople \u2014 Arthur Schwartz (@ArthurSchwartz) August 30, 2019\n\nSource told me off the record that @PhilipRucker doesn\u2019t know how to #BeBest. \u2014 Arthur Schwartz (@ArthurSchwartz) August 30, 2019\n\nUPDATE 3;38 p.m. ET:\n\nAfter the publication of this article, the Washington Post provided Breitbart News with a statement from the newspaper\u2019s national editor Steven Ginsberg defending Rucker.\n\n\u201cPhilip Rucker is one of the best and most scrupulous reporters in the news business,\u201d Ginsberg said. \u201cHe has always acted with the utmost honor and integrity and has never violated Washington Post standards or policies.\u201d\n\nNotably, Ginsberg\u2019s statement does not deny what Schwartz has alleged, that Rucker burned Westerhout\u2019s off-the-record statement. A Post spokesperson has not replied to a follow-up email asking if the newspaper denies that.", "description": "The Washington Post's White House bureau chief, Philip Rucker, has not denied allegations he leaked a conversation with now-former White House official Madeleine Westerhout.", "authors": ["Matthew Boyle"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/06/Rucker-623-Thumbnail.jpg"}
