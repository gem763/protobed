Lawmakers granted preliminary approval to the withdrawal deal he struck with the European Union last week, a major step toward achieving the prime minister\u2019s goal of Brexit and one that broke a string of defeats for him.\n\nBut the lawmakers refused in a crucial follow-up vote to put legislation enacting Britain\u2019s departure on a fast track to passage, which could have enabled Mr. Johnson to meet his deadline of leaving the European Union by Oct. 31.\n\nNow, however, Parliament has thrown the whole process into a legislative netherworld that could mean months of further delays to a process that the nation has long since wearied of and just wants to see end.", "description": "Lawmakers voted down a measure to compress the timetable to debate the new withdrawal deal, in a rebuke to the prime minister.", "authors": ["Mark Landler", "Stephen Castle"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/19/world/europe/22brexit-hfo-loose-promo/22brexit-hfo-loose-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
