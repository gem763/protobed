(You can check the entire PDF of the correspondence here.) Strangely, it was sent to me and had no other contacts in cc. Perhaps he wanted to send it to \u201cJE\u201d but put my email there by mistake. When I commented on the meaning of this cryptic message, he responded with the following message, reproduced here in full:\n\nI missed that one. Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire science philanthropist showed up at this weekend\u2019s event by helicopter (with his beautiful young assistant from Belarus). He\u2019ll be in Cambridge in a couple of weeks asked me who he should meet. You are one of the people I suggested and I told him I would send some links. He\u2019s the guy who gave Harvard #30m to set up Martin Nowak. He\u2019s been extremely generous in funding projects of many of our friends and clients. He also got into trouble and spent a year in jail in Florida. If he contacts you it\u2019s probably worth your time to meet him as he\u2019s extremely bright and interesting. Last time I visited his house (the largest private residence in NYC), I walked in to find him in a sweatsuit and a British guy in a suit with suspenders, getting foot massages from two young well-dressed Russian women. After grilling me for a while about cyber-security, the Brit, named Andy, was commenting on the Swedish authorities and the charges against Julian Assange. \u201cWe think they\u2019re liberal in Sweden, but its more like Northern England as opposed to Southern Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Monaco, Albert works 12 hours a day but at 9pm, when he goes out, he does whatever he wants, and nobody cares. But, if I do it, I\u2019m in big trouble.\u201d At that point I realized that the recipient of Irina\u2019s foot massage was his Royal Highness, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. Indeed, a week later, on a slow news day, the cover of the NYpost had a full-page photo of Jeffrey and Andrew walking in Central Park under the headline: \u201cThe Prince and the Perv.\u201d (That was the end of Andrew\u2019s role at the UK trade ambassador.)\n\nTo which I responded:\n\nthanks for clarifying this. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s an all-around sweet guy but I\u2019ll have to think about it. It could be that I spent far too much time in the Soros bubble but I have zero interest in meeting billionaires - if I did, I\u2019d be going to Davos every year. but I appreciate you taking the time.\n\nHere is Brockman again:\n\nA billionaire who owns Victoria\u2019s Secret plus a modelling agency is a different kind of animal. But I hear you and basically agree. Gregory Bateson once advised me that \u2018Of all our human inventions, economic man is by far the dullest.\u2019 JB\n\nAnd here is my final answer:\n\n\u201cA billionaire who owns Victoria\u2019s Secret plus a modelling agency\u201d --> one more reason to stay away actually.\n\nI didn\u2019t know who Epstein was at the time. Since I\u2019ve never been very keen to hang out with billionaires, mine was a natural response (I similarly declined Brockman\u2019s invitations to hang out on his farm or attend his famous billionaire dinners). So I didn\u2019t think much of that invitation and eventually forgot about it. Needless to say, I never heard from Epstein\u2014or from Brockman about Epstein.\n\nIn that old email, it seems clear that Brockman was acting as Epstein\u2019s PR man\u2014his liaison with the world of scientists and intellectuals that Brockman had cultivated. That Brockman has said nothing over this affair is rather bewildering. (He did not return requests for comment left on his email and voicemail.)\n\n\n\n\n\nI do know that John Brockman has been in poor health over the last few years. So I have cut him some slack. But, patient as I am, the time has run out. It\u2019s not as if the Epstein story broke yesterday. It\u2019s been more than a month since Epstein was arrested on the latest charges. Still, no word on the issue. And, now that I\u2019ve found that old email he sent me, I cannot believe that he knew absolutely nothing of Epstein\u2019s wild sexual escapades\u2014in fact, his email suggests he was trying to capitalize on them to recruit yet another useful idiot into Epstein\u2019s network.\n\nThere\u2019s more: A close analysis of Edge Foundation\u2019s (publicly available) financial statements suggests that, between 2001 and 2015, it has received $638,000 from Epstein\u2019s various foundations. In many of those years, Epstein was Edge\u2019s sole donor. Yet, how many of Edge\u2019s contributors\u2014let alone readers\u2014knew Epstein played so large a role in the organization?\n\nI\u2019m just one of the many authors in Brockman\u2019s agency; my departure wouldn\u2019t affect anything. I am also the last one to complain: His agency sold two of my books, and I have two more underway, also sold by them.\n\nYet, I am ready to pull the plug on my association with Brockman\u2019s agency\u2014and would encourage other authors to consider doing the same\u2014until and unless he clarifies the relationship between him, the Edge Foundation, and Epstein. If such an explanation is not forthcoming, many of us will have to decide whether we would like to be part of this odd intellectual club located on the dubious continuum between the seminar room and a sex-trafficking ring.\n\nExcessive networking, it appears, devours its own. Brockman is already many months too late to what he should have done much earlier: close down the Edge Foundation, publicly repent, retire, and turn Brockman Inc. into yet another banal literary agency. The kind where authors do not have to mingle with billionaires at fancy dinners or worry about walking in on Prince Andrew getting his foot massage.
