They will not be affected by the disconnections, chamber CEO Isaac Kwesu said.\n\nOn Thursday, Zimbabwe was generating 688 MW of electricity, less than half its peak demand, official figures showed.\n\nThe country imports up to 400 MW from South Africa and Mozambique when they have spare capacity.\n\nEarlier this month, Zimbabwe hiked its average electricity tariff by 320 percent to increase power supplies, angering consumers already grappling with soaring inflation and the country's worst economic crisis in a decade.", "description": "Daily power cuts lasting up to 18 hours are common after a severe drought reduced water levels at a key hydro plant.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/24/f02a93fcd21748db980f0661fd79370f_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
