Would it cause them to lose House seats? Would it hurt their chances of winning the Senate? Wasn\u2019t it pointless because of the near certainty the GOP Senate wouldn\u2019t convict him?\n\nBut Trump just made the Democrats\u2019 choice for them. He left them no alternative but to proceed with impeachment \u2014 and they will.\n\nThe president admitted Tuesday that he withheld congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine just days before a phone call with the Ukrainian president in which he demanded Ukraine produce dirt on Trump\u2019s likeliest Democratic opponent. That, on its face, is a flagrant abuse of power and nearly identical to the behavior, denied by Trump, at the core of the Russia investigation: seeking a foreign government\u2019s help in a U.S. election.\n\nIt is the latest instance of him using the levers of government for his own political ends, to enrich himself, to reward friends and to punish opponents. This is the stuff of tin-pot dictatorships, not the United States. If the Constitution means anything at all, Congress must seek his removal.\n\nNow that Democrats are pursuing an impeachment inquiry, the pressure \u2014 and the quandary \u2014 shifts. The question now is whether Republicans, who have tacitly endorsed Trump\u2019s behavior so far, will go on record to uphold the propriety of this conduct and in doing so, affirm the constitutionality of such behavior not just for him but for presidents to come.\n\nRepublicans (who decided perjury about sex was impeachment-worthy, and who thought it an abuse of power to defer deportations of certain illegal immigrants) must now decide whether to accept Trump\u2019s standard as proper for future presidents. Would Republicans, with their votes on Trump\u2019s impeachment, condone the actions of, say, future President Elizabeth Warren when she:\n\n\u25cf Defies congressional power of the purse by unilaterally raiding the Pentagon budget to finance her pet projects?\n\n\u25cf Rejects the authority of congressional oversight, disregards subpoenas and refuses to furnish documents, including a whistleblower complaint about the president deemed \u201curgent\u201d by the intelligence community?\n\n\u25cf Is found by an independent prosecutor appointed by her own administration to have engaged in 10 possible instances of obstruction of justice but is not charged because regulations prohibit such a move against a sitting president?\n\n\u25cf Approves and reimburses secret payments, in violation of campaign-finance law, to a person threatening to put out damaging information about her?\n\n\u25cf Fires an FBI director who refuses to call off a probe of one of her close associates?\n\n\u25cf Declares federal law enforcement officials who investigate her guilty of \u201ctreason,\u201d demands they be put under investigation and succeeds in getting one of them fired and brought to the brink of indictment?\n\n\u25cf Rescinds the security clearance of a former CIA director critical of her, as well as the press credentials of journalists who criticize her administration?\n\n\u25cf Persuades a foreign leader not to admit Republican members of Congress into his country?\n\n\u25cf Grounds the jet used for official business by the congressional leader of the Republican Party?\n\n\u25cf Repeatedly releases highly classified intelligence, some to a foreign enemy and some only to Democrats?\n\n\u25cf Threatens to cut off highway funds and disaster aid to states and territories controlled by Republicans, and declares she has the \u201cabsolute\u201d right to move criminals to jurisdictions governed by Republicans?\n\n\u25cf Funnels millions of taxpayer dollars to her own businesses, pressures federal agencies and international organizations to do business with her personal enterprises, invites foreign governments to pay millions of dollars to her businesses, and rejects a law requiring her to provide Congress with her tax returns?\n\n\u25cf Calls for a boycott of the parent company of a media outlet critical of her, threatens an antitrust action against the owner of another media outlet critical of her, says she can unilaterally order businesses to disinvest from a country and calls for federal punishment of individual businesses she doesn\u2019t like?\n\n\u25cf Circumvents the Constitution\u2019s advice-and-consent provision by running the government with \u201cacting\u201d officials (unqualified but loyal to her) not confirmed by the Senate?\n\n\u25cf Offers to pardon those who commit crimes enforcing her policies, questions the authority of certain judges because they are GOP appointees and pardons a political ally who ignored court orders?\n\n\u25cf Without congressional approval, establishes a de facto network of internment camps, run under inhumane conditions, for a class of people she disdains?\n\n\u25cf And, finally, asks and coerces foreign governments to sabotage her Republican opponents\u2019 campaigns?\n\nRepublicans have blessed all of this and more with their silence. They must now state their positions explicitly. If they vote to accept such conduct by this and, therefore, future presidents, the American experiment will be badly damaged. But if they aren\u2019t at least forced to answer the question, it has already failed.\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "What would Republicans let President Elizabeth Warren get away with?", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics", "September At Pm", "Dana Milbank Is An Op-Ed Columnist.
