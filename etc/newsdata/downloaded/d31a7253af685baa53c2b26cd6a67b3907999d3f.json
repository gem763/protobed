She certainly didn\u2019t win any over to her side.\n\nOf course, no one\u2019s shy about attributing to Trump\u2019s supporters every evil they see in him; to them, Trump is without question a white supremacist, and that makes anyone who supports him a white supremacist.\n\nKurt Schlichter, columnist over at Twitchy sister-site Townhall, often reminds conservatives on Twitter that liberals hate them, and some blue checks, including Soledad O\u2019Brien, made that perfectly clear.\n\nHe\u2019s a racist and a bigot and these people behind him are trash. https://t.co/2dYurCaR0e \u2014 Soledad O'Brien (@soledadobrien) October 11, 2019\n\nTotal Trash! We shouldn\u2019t ever be shy about calling them what they are. I liked this shot of the troll that we\u2019ve all heard from. pic.twitter.com/cPL6ieAErq \u2014 Gailen David (@gailendavid) October 11, 2019\n\nThey all look the same like some other category of primate. \u2014 Andrew McFadden (@rbduval77) October 11, 2019\n\nHis rallies are sold out circuses where the audience is the freak show. \u2014 Gailen David (@gailendavid) October 11, 2019\n\nNazi youth, hypnotized at a rally for a failing tv star. White nationalism stars in their eyes. Trump rallies remind me of Leni Riefenstahl films. #FridayFeeling pic.twitter.com/F0JH8t9G1n \u2014 Barbara Malmet (@B52Malmet) October 11, 2019\n\nOver 100 likes for a Democrat who just said this. https://t.co/EonXOzRMlC \u2014 While Supplies Last (@corrcomm) October 12, 2019\n\nYou realize there are people in both parties that look like that\u2026 \u2014 Chris Borne (@ChrisBorne3) October 12, 2019\n\nThey say \"love trumps hate\", but they *do* this ^^^ \u2014 Zotzer (@zotzer) October 12, 2019\n\nYep. They ARE the people they have hated the past 3 years. Just about everything they have criticized Republicans for they do them on regular basis. The lack of self awareness is humorous to me though \u2014 Card March is 2 hrs 30 mins before games!!! (@CardsnDerby) October 12, 2019\n\n@soledadobrien calling people with a different political viewpoint racist trash, while failing to recognize her very own bigotry. It's why Trump won and why she will be singing this off key melody for 4 more years. https://t.co/a1PIdIObKm \u2014 BayAreaFrau (@bayareahausfrau) October 12, 2019\n\nShe is arguably the most racist person on Twitter, ironic that she cries racism with every other tweet. \u2014 Kevin Doney (@doneykevin1) October 12, 2019\n\nYeah, @soledadobrien just makes me depressed. Her arrogance & hubris & inability into seeing the humanity in her fellow Americans \u2013 who voted for Obama in 2008 & 2012 \u2013 by the way \u2013 is unfathomable. She's going to get Trump supporters hurt or killed with her indignation. \u2014 RebeccaThrockmorton (@RebeccaThrockm9) October 12, 2019\n\nThese kinds of remarks show a basic bias and disrespect for the American people. \u2615 \u2014 Michele Duffy (@MicheleDuffy18) October 12, 2019\n\nKeep reminding me why I'll never vote liberal or democrat.\n\nThank you for posting. \u2014 ISMV Star Fortress trapped in the 21st century (@StarFortress) October 12, 2019\n\nThere are plenty of overweight, unattractive Democrats. Ain\u2019t nobody got any business talking about someone else\u2019s appearance. This is ugly, below the belt, and simply wrong. We need to be better than this. \u2014 Bruce Channell (@bruce_channell) October 12, 2019\n\nAgree. This leads nowhere good. \u2014 Velveteen Yabbit (@VYabbit) October 12, 2019\n\nDehumanizing the other side. That's a Nazi tactic. \u2014 northclickboy (@chadwhitfield5) October 12, 2019\n\nIs this the anti-bigotry thread? It's hard to tell\u2026 \u2014 McKay Smith (@_mckay_smith) October 12, 2019\n\nThey\u2019re doing their part to get Trump\u2019s base out to the polls, and maybe some fed-up independents too.\n\nLiberals hate you. I keep telling you. THEY keep telling you. You need to listen. And you need to prepare. https://t.co/fP4ks68TRI \u2014 Kurt Schlichter (@KurtSchlichter) October 12, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "Looks like the Democrats' outreach to Trump supporters is going well.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/trump-supporters-rally.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
