They were also handed a 24-hour ban from chatting on the platform.\n\nBut Blizzard said it was only banning people who were spamming the chat with the same message.\n\nIn a statement sent to Polygon, Blizzard said: \"We are not banning people from Twitch chat for specifically using pro Hong Kong speech or any other political statements. Bans are being levied by an automated moderating system that's triggered by viewers spamming any phrase repeatedly. We expect to have the issue corrected in the next few hours.\"\n\nBusiness Insider has contacted Blizzard for confirmation.\n\nThe explanation seems to make sense. Per The Verge, the chat bans were inconsistent given some pro-Hong Kong comments appear to have been left undeleted during reruns of reruns of Masters Tour games. And at least one Reddit user claimed the US games giant has also banned Twitch viewers who express pro-China views.\n\nThis might be a false alarm, but Blizzard has been at the centre of a political firestorm in recent weeks after meting out a series of bans to Hearthstone players expressing pro-Hong Kong views.\n\nRead more: Blizzard says its 'relationships in China had no influence on our decision' to punish an esports athlete who voiced his support for Hong Kong protesters\n\nEarlier this month, the firm handed professional Hearthstone player Chung 'Blitzchung' Ng Wai a year-long ban and confiscated his prize money after he yelled \"Free Hong Kong, revolution of our age\" during a live post-game interview, but later reduced the ban to six months and handed back his money amid public outrage.\n\nMore recently, it handed six-month bans to three college-level Hearthstone players after they held up a sign that read \"Free Hong Kong, Boycott Blizz\" during a tournament livestream.\n\nFor its part, Blizzard \u2013 whose parent company, Activision Blizzard, is part-owned by Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent \u2013 has denied that China is the driving force behind its bans. Discussing it decision to ban Blitzchung, Blizzard's president J. Allen Brack released a statement in which he insisted that \"our relationships in China had no influence on our decision.\"\n\nDemocratic Senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among the US politicians to have questioned Blizzard's recent actions. ERIN SCOTT / Reuters\n\nBrack's statement added that \"one of our goals at Blizzard is to make sure that every player, everywhere in the world, regardless of political views, religious beliefs, race, gender, or any other consideration always feels safe and welcome both competing in and playing our games.\"\n\nGamers, politicians and even Blizzard's own employees appear unconvinced, however.\n\nUp to thirty Activision Blizzard employees reportedly walked out of work on October 8 in protest at Blizzard's actions over Blitzchung, and on Friday, several US politicians including Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez signed a cross-party letter urging it to rethink its Blitzchung ban.\n\nThe company has also become the source of widespread mockery on social media, with the Overwatch character Mei morphing into an unofficial anti-Blizzard mascot.", "description": "Blizzard said it banned people for spam, not their political views.", "authors": ["Charlie Wood"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dad8bf5cc4a0a30354b4787?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
