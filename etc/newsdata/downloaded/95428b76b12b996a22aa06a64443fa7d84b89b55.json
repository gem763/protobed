It's important at this point for everyone to realise there is a big difference between fighters wanting to face Anthony Joshua and fighters simply saying they want to.\n\nWe have made offers to the major heavyweight contenders and we will be making more offers in the next couple of days with a view to finalising a decision in the next 10 days over Joshua's next fight.\n\nDeontay Wilder, Tyson Fury and Dillian Whyte all have the opportunity to get in the ring at Wembley in April and fight for Joshua's four world titles... If you think you can beat him, our message is simple: come and get it. Who really wants it? This is your chance.\n\nAnthony Joshua's preference is to fight Deontay Wilder at Wembley Stadium in April\n\nTyson Fury is also on the list, while Wilder's team are not responding to Eddie Hearn's emails\n\nTo repeat myself, if it was down to AJ, he would want Wilder. He wants to be undisputed champion, we all know that by now.\n\nBut the difficulty and frustration is that I have now gone five or six unanswered emails from their end across three weeks or so. Is Wilder bluffing the public when he says he wants this fight?\n\nIf he truly wants it, it's there and he knows it is there because we have told them. If he doesn't want it, he can have his rematch with Tyson Fury or take on Dominic Breazeale and good luck to him. But if he has ambitions to be undisputed champion, as Joshua does, then the opportunity is there now.\n\nThe Tyson Fury fight is obviously one Joshua would love. I have spoken to Fury and it is a fight we would want. He knows that. Fury has proved everyone wrong and deserves enormous respect. It would be a huge fight and occasion and we could make it for April.\n\nDillian Whyte (R) is also in the frame, but he recently poured cold water on reports of a rematch\n\nJoshua (left) wants to fight Whyte too, after he got under his skin after the Dereck Chisora bout\n\nLikewise Whyte knows he has the opportunity. Joshua wants to fight him - he always does. I think Whyte got under his skin a bit after the Dereck Chisora fight and it's not as though they needed any more needle between them.\n\nA lot of people have said Whyte is favourite to get the fight but at this point it is hard to say. Offers have gone in and he has spoken a bit about what he thinks of the offer. We have not made an official offer to Jarrell Miller but he is also an option.\n\nWhen the time comes to take AJ to the US and build his presence over there, fighting a New Yorker at Madison Square Garden would work for us.\n\nAll I can say is that when people, and I'm talking about all fighters here, say they are getting low-ball offers or whatever, you have to remember you are also being offered the opportunity to fight for the world titles.\n\nIf Wilder thinks he can beat AJ at Wembley, Matchroom's message is simple: come and get it\n\nJoshua (right) has not fought since beating Alexander Povetkin at Wembley back in September\n\nIt is not just the money. And on that - it is not like they are being offered bad money. But on top of the money they have the shot at beating Anthony Joshua.\n\nJoshua fought for relative peanuts when he took on Charles Martin for the world title. It was about the opportunity and we put value on that opportunity. I am not saying we are offering peanuts, because we're not.\n\nBut we are offering the opportunity for a fighter to become one of the biggest stars in world sport. If you think you are up to it, if you think you can take out Anthony Joshua, then come and try.\n\nJoshua fought for relative peanuts when he took on Charles Martin for the world title at the O2", "description": "EDDIE HEARN: I have had a lot of people asking for an update on Joshua and as ever a lot of work has been going on behind the scenes.
