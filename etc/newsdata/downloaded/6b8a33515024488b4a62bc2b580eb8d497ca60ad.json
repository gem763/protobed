There was nobody home when I got in so I cracked up the bottle and relaxed watching Netflix. Had the bottle over about an hour and a half, was very relaxed and had an early night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnits: 10\n\nSaturday\n\nMyself and my partner went out for dinner. It\u2019s our weekly date night, once spent in the pub but we have little interest in Saturday nights out anymore.\n\nI ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio, he drank beer. We had a lovely evening, and both left to go home. We didn\u2019t drink anymore when we got home.\n\nUnits: 10\n\nSunday\n\nI met my friend in the city for brunch. Bottomless brunch and we totally abused the bottomless mimosas on offer over the 2.5 hours we were there.\n\nShe is having a very hard time at the moment so we just had a good catch up. After brunch we went to our local watering hole near our work. We had two more drinks, gin for her, wine for me. I made my way home and my partner picked me up from the train station.\n\nWe had decided we would go see The Joker that night. We were early for the movie so we went to a hotel bar while we waited and I had two glasses of Pinot Grigio.\n\nUnits: 27 (we used an upper estimate of 10 mimosas)\n\nMonday\n\nI am absolutely exhausted all day long and promise myself I\u2019ll take myself to my favourite cocktail bar after work.\n\nI leave work at finishing time and made my way to Dawson Street in Dublin. It\u2019s my favourite street to go for drinks on. I started off in my local bar and had a glass of wine. The atmosphere was dead and it was just really quiet so I left.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI walked to the cocktail bar, they have a vast menu and are very creative with the presentation, it is more like a show than just going for drinks. Here I had four cocktails, each more delicious than the last.\n\nI left after cocktail number four to catch my train.\n\nUnits: 8.6\n\nTuesday\n\nI didn\u2019t drink at all\n\nUnits: 0\n\nWednesday\n\nAnother friend left her job yesterday so after work I joined her to celebrate. It was a tame affair, I had three pints of cider and a vodka and Diet Coke. I left early and went straight home.\n\nUnits: 10\n\nThursday\n\nLast day in work this week and I am hanging for the weekend. Partner really wants to go out but I\u2019m not in the mood so we compromised on a date night.\n\nHe has some Bush Mills whiskey and I grabbed a bottle of Cava Brut in M&S on the way home. We are going to enjoy our drinks, watch Netflix eat take away and hopefully be in bed by midnight.\n\nUnits: 9\n\nTotal units this week: 74.6\n\nTotal units in a week recommended by the NHS: 14 units (for anybody regardless of gender).\n\nSpill It is a weekly series out every Friday.
