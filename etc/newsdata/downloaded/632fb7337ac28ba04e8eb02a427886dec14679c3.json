Millions killed!\n\n'No thanks Susan, you were a disaster.'\n\nPresident Trump (left) and his predecessor's national security adviser, Susan Rice (right), feuded on Twitter late Friday\n\nThe president tweeted: 'Susan Rice, who was a disaster to President Obama as National Security Advisor, is now telling us her opinion on what to do in Syria.'\n\nOn Twitter, Rice responded to Trump, writing: 'Then why did you come up and hug me at 2015 [White House Correspondents Dinner] when I'd never met you (which was totally gross) and whisper in my ear that I had been 'very unfairly treated' over Benghazi and 'was doing a great job for the country'?'\n\nOn Twitter, Rice responded to Trump, writing: 'Then why did you come up and hug me at 2015 [White House Correspondents Dinner] when I'd never met you (which was totally gross) and whisper in my ear that I had been 'very unfairly treated' over Benghazi and 'was doing a great job for the country'?'\n\nThe 'red line in the sand' that Trump mentioned was a reference to the 'red line' comment by then-President Obama who suggested in 2012 that America would use military force in Syria if President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons in that country's civil war.\n\nEven though Syria is believed to have used chemical weapons, the Obama administration declined to use military force.\n\nInstead, the U.S. and Russia made an agreement requiring Syria to give up its arsenal of chemical weapons, thus averting American military action.\n\nTrump on Friday night was presumably watching Rice during her appearance on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher.\n\nIn comments to the press, Rice has blasted Trump's Syria policy as 'nothing short of a self-inflicted strategic catastrophe.'\n\nLast week, Trump ordered the removal of American troops from a swath of land straddling the Syria-Turkey border.\n\nTrump was presumably watching Rice during her appearance on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher. From left: Maher, Rice, and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson\n\nThe move allowed Turkey to launch an offensive against Syrian Kurds - who allied with America in helping defeat ISIS.\n\nRice has been making the rounds on major media outlets to promote her book, Tough Love: My Story of the Things Worth Fighting For, a memoir about her tenure in the Obama administration.\n\nRice, who was Obama's ambassador to the United Nations before serving as his national security adviser, mentioned Benghazi in her tweet.\n\nBenghazi is the coastal Libyan town where in 2012, a militant Islamic mob attacked the American diplomatic mission, killing U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens; Sean Smith, a State Department official; and two CIA operatives - Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods.\n\nRice became the public face of the scandal when she infamously fronted cameras in the wake of the incident and claimed it was a spontaneous attack.\n\nInvestigations later concluded the attack was, in fact, premeditated and carried out by an Islamic militant group.\n\nThe controversy ultimately derailed her chance of succeeding Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State and turned her into a hate figure for the right.\n\nRice's memoir details how the political firestorm sparked by the incident took a toll on her and her family.\n\nA 2015 blog post from the news site The Hill appears to support Rice's version of events.\n\nTrump and Rice are photographed speaking at the annual White House Correspondents Dinner inside the Washington Hilton ballroom.\n\nAccording to The Hill, Trump gave Rice 'a huge and dramatic hug' in the middle of the ballroom.\n\nTrump then was heard whispering in Rice's ear: 'Nothing's easy in life.'\n\nAfter their encounter, Rice and another friend were heard laughing about Trump's hug.\n\n'What do you call that? Molestation?' Rice joked to a friend.\n\nTrump told The Hill that he sympathized with Rice.\n\n'She's got the toughest job,' Trump said. 'She's a good woman.'\n\n'And nothing in life is easy, there's no question about it.'\n\nAt the time, Trump had not yet declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination.\n\nTrump, who was still host of The Apprentice on NBC, attended the 2015 dinner as a guest of the Fox News Channel.", "description": "President Trump lashed out at Susan Rice on Friday as a 'disaster' before Barack Obama's national security adviser clapped back by calling him 'gross' for hugging her at a DC dinner in 2015.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/05/19911844-0-image-a-64_1571460811737.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
