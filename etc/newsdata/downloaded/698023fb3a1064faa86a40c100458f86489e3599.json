PRECIOUS-Gold dips as dollar holds strong ahead of Sino-U.S. trade talks\n\n* Gold set for third straight decline\n\n* Sino-U.S. trade talks to take place on Oct 10-11 (Adds technicals; updates prices)\n\nBy Karthika Suresh Namboothiri\n\nOct 8 (Reuters) - Gold prices slipped to a near one-week low on Tuesday, declining for a third straight session, weighed down by a firmer dollar ahead of the upcoming trade talks between China and the United States.\n\nSpot gold was down 0.3% at $1,489.32 per ounce, as of 0627 GMT. Prices had dropped 1% in the previous session.\n\nU.S. GCcv1 fell 0.6% to $1,494.60 per ounce.\n\n\"One of the key factors to the gold market is the outlook for global growth, and with trade developments between U.S. and China, traders are on alert,\" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.\n\nTop-level trade talks are scheduled to resume on Thursday, when Chinese Vice Premier Liu He meets with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\n\"The market is very vulnerable to headlines. Any further news on discussions in the U.S. with negotiators in China could be very important,\" McCarthy said.\n\nAsian shares inched up in early trade, though caution prevailed as expectations of a trade deal dimmed after Washington blacklisted Chinese companies over Beijing's treatment of predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities and President Donald Trump said a quick trade deal was unlikely. uncertainty regarding the outcome of trade talks had pushed the higher overnight.

Trump has said the tariff increase will take effect if no progress is made in the negotiations.\n\nData from China on Tuesday did little to cheer markets after the services sector grew at its slowest pace in seven months in September, despite a strong increase in new orders. the moment we are fairly in a trading range.
