When news broke last month that congressional Democrats were opening an impeachment inquiry, the campaign responded with an advertising blitz aimed at firing up the president\u2019s base.\n\nThe campaign slapped together an \u201cImpeachment Poll\u201d (sample question: \u201cDo you agree that President Trump has done nothing wrong?\u201d). It invited supporters to join the Official Impeachment Defense Task Force (\u201cAll you need to do is DONATE NOW!\u201d). It produced a slick video laying out the debunked conspiracy theory about former Vice President Joe Biden and Ukraine that is now at the center of the impeachment battle (\u201cLearn the truth. Watch Now!\u201d).\n\nThe onslaught overwhelmed the limited Democratic response. Biden\u2019s campaign put up the stiffest resistance: It demanded Facebook take down the ad, only to be rebuffed. It then proceeded with plans to slash its online advertising budget in favor of more television ads.\n\nThat campaigns are now being fought largely online is hardly a revelation, yet only one political party seems to have gotten the message. While the Trump campaign has put its digital operation firmly at the center of the president\u2019s reelection effort, Democrats are struggling to internalize the lessons of the 2016 race and adapt to a political landscape shaped by social media.\n\nTrump\u2019s first campaign took far better advantage of Facebook and other platforms that reward narrowly targeted \u2014 and, arguably, nastier \u2014 messages. And while the president is now embattled on multiple fronts and disfavored by a majority of Americans in most polls, he has one big advantage: His 2020 campaign, flush with cash, is poised to dominate online again, according to experts on both ends of the political spectrum, independent researchers and tech executives. The difference between the parties\u2019 digital efforts, they said, runs far deeper than the distinction between an incumbent\u2019s general-election operation and challengers\u2019 primary campaigns.\n\nThe Trump team has spent the past three years building out its web operation. As a sign of its priorities, the 2016 digital director, Brad Parscale, is now leading the entire campaign. He is at the helm of what experts described as a sophisticated digital marketing effort, one that befits a relentlessly self-promoting candidate who honed his image, and broadcast it into national consciousness, on reality television.\n\nThe campaign under Parscale is focused on pushing its product \u2014 Trump \u2014 by churning out targeted ads, aggressively testing the content and collecting data to further refine its messages. It is selling hats, shirts and other gear, a strategy that yields yet more data, along with cash and, of course, walking campaign billboards.\n\n\u201cWe see much less of that kind of experimentation with the Democratic candidates,\u201d said Laura Edelson, a researcher at New York University who tracks political advertising on Facebook. \u201cThey\u2019re running fewer ads. We don\u2019t see the wide array of targeting.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign, she said, \u201cis like a supercar racing a little Volkswagen Bug.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats would be the Volkswagen. They are largely running what other experts and political operatives compared to brand loyalty campaigns, trying to sway moderates and offend as few people as possible, despite mounting research that suggests persuasion ads have little to no effect on voters in a general election.\n\nThe candidates, to be sure, are collectively spending more on Facebook and Google than on television and are trying to target their ads \u2014 Biden\u2019s tend to be seen by those born before 1975, for instance, while Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 are aimed at those born later. But without the same level of message testing and data collection, Democrats\u2019 efforts are not nearly as robust as Trump\u2019s.\n\nDemocratic digital operatives said the problem is a party dominated by an aging professional political class that is too timid in the face of a fiercely partisan Republican machine. The Biden campaign\u2019s decision to tack from digital to television, they said, is only the most glaring example of a party hung up on the kind of broad-based advertising that played well in the television age but fares poorly on social media.", "description": "On any given day, President Donald Trump's campaign is plastering ads all over Facebook, YouTube and the millions of sites served by Google, hitting the kind of incendiary themes -- immigrant invaders, the corrupt media -- that play best on platforms where algorithms favor outrage and political campaigns", "authors": ["Matthew Rosenberg", "Kevin Roose"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QBJBF.NHpLaXVSUysQctqA--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/d7f1c4c592c4982c4e41573cc6db0290", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
