Sale cited a White House letter stating that it would not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, which it claimed was invalid.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSale's letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Hill, argues that the subpoena is \"overbroad, unduly burdensome, and seeks documents beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry.\" Sale also asserted that certain documents in the subpoena fall under attorney-client privilege, an argument some legal experts expressed skepticism about.\n\nAn official working on the impeachment inquiry said Democrats will consider Trump and his personal attorney to be obstructing their probe if Giuliani refuses to testify.\n\n\u201cWitnesses do not get to choose whether to comply with a duly-authorized subpoena, or to pick their investigators\u2014not in the justice system, not in the Congress, and not in our democracy,\" the official said in a written statement.\n\n\"If Rudy Giuliani and the President truly have nothing to hide about their actions, Giuliani will comply\u2014otherwise, we will be forced to consider this as additional evidence of obstruction, and may infer that the evidence withheld would substantiate the accusations of President Trump\u2019s misconduct and efforts to cover it up. Nobody is above the law, not a president, and not his shadow envoy to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nGiuliani hired Sale, a former Watergate prosecutor, to assist him in responding to the subpoena. Sale told The Hill on Tuesday his work for Giuliani is completed, and he is no longer representing him as a result.\n\nHouse Democrats sent Giuliani a subpoena on Sept. 30 seeking documents related to his work in Ukraine, which is at the heart of an ongoing impeachment inquiry into Trump.
