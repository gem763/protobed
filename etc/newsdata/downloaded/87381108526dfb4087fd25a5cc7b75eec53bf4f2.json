Plus, there were the meticulous hours spent preparing and tying water balloons, precisely filling up the water reservoir on a super soaker, and the endless pumping to keep the tank pressurized so you didn\u2019t end up just spraying the ground three feet in front of you.\n\nThe fanciest water gun ever?\n\nNow, there\u2019s the Spyra One, which resemblances the water guns I grew up with as much as a musket does a sniper rifle. The Spyra One doesn\u2019t shoot a stream of water; it shoots precisely measured bursts of \u201cwater bullets\u201d that the company claims can clearly and accurately hit targets up to 25 feet away.\n\nThere\u2019s an integrated pump that lets you refill the tank just by dunking the front of the Spyra One into a pool, lake, or bucket of water. It takes about 14 seconds to refill. There\u2019s no pumping, either. That same pump keeps the tank pressurized so you\u2019re able to start spraying water. But things get truly ridiculous with my favorite feature: a display that features a digital ammo counter that feels more at home on a futuristic rifle from Halo than an actual water gun.\n\nBetween the pump and the ammo counter, the Spyra One also features a rechargeable battery, which the company says should last for around 45 fill cycles before you\u2019ll need to recharge.\n\nWhen you do need to juice up the Spyra One, you\u2019ll do so by plugging in a \u2014 wait, that can\u2019t be right \u2014 a standard USB-C cable. This water gun charges by USB-C. I never want to hear another person tell me that the state of the peripheral market isn\u2019t mature enough yet, and that\u2019s why my new headphones / laptop / speaker / battery pack has to use regular USB or Micro USB ever again.\n\nA world where a water gun charges by USB-C and my headphones don\u2019t\n\nThere are a couple of caveats to point out, though. First off, the Spyra One is available to back on Kickstarter for \u20ac115 (roughly $133). That\u2019s a ridiculous amount of money to ever invest in a water gun, unless you and your friends take your backyard battles extremely seriously. Spyra also isn\u2019t expecting to ship the water guns until August 2019, which means you won\u2019t be able to get any use out of it this summer. Also, the historically iffy track record of Kickstarters hitting their deadlines means you might have to wait until summer 2020 before you get the chance to take your $133 water gun for a proper spin.\n\nHere\u2019s the ever-present reminder that this is a first-time product from a new company that has yet to ship a device. And while there are several working prototypes already, there\u2019s a big jump from that stage to having a mass-produced shipping product.
