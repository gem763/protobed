That will force boards to put more weight on non-financial measures - such as customer satisfaction, customer complaints, and employee engagement - in determining bonuses.\n\nBut although Byers conceded that APRA's proposal had been widely and strongly criticised, he said the onus was on the critics to come up with an alternative proposal \"that isn't just the status quo because outcomes from the status quo have been found unacceptable\".\n\nBankers have been left flabbergasted by Byres' argument. Not only does it demonstrate the regulator's contempt for their views, but it also indicates that APRA felt under such strong pressure to make changes that it would prefer to push ahead with a deeply flawed policy rather than to leave things as they are.\n\n\"If senior bankers are going to be measured by the level of customer satisfaction and customer complaints, then the easiest way to address that problem is simply to stop lending to people who are most likely to be problem customers,\" said one highly regarded bank director.\n\n\"This is already happening, but Byres doesn't seem too interested in addressing that issue.\"", "description": "It's symptomatic of the poor standing of the country's major lenders that the regulator is pushing ahead with its widely condemned bonus proposal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7926%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_157/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c44e3acf6abc8d6bbd4167b0986b732aba9d3637", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
