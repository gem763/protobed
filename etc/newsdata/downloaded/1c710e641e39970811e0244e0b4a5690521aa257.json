(Reuters) - Scott Renfroe was smoking cigarettes with his wife at the end of a dock in Titusville, Florida, on Tuesday morning, where he had come to see if Hurricane Dorian had brought the powerful wind gusts and rip currents that meteorologists have warned about for days.\n\nA man feeds pigeons at a park ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Dorian in Titusville, U.S., September 3, 2019. REUTERS/Marco Bello\n\nThe water was high but not too rough, and there was not a raindrop to be felt, despite nearly a week of warnings that had Renfroe and his neighbours boarding up their homes and stockpiling food as one of the most powerful hurricanes on record devastated the Bahamas and threatened Florida.\n\nAs Dorian\u2019s winds eased on Tuesday \u2014 to what forecasters warned was a still-powerful Category 2 storm \u2014 some public safety officials worried that the long wait could lead to a sense of complacency along the storm\u2019s projected path.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an emotional roller coaster when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on and you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s coming,\u201d said Renfroe, a 43-year-old road technician. \u201cIt went from being a really elevated, kind of antsy scared moment to being able to relax a little more, but at the same time just wanting it to go through so we could go back to our normal lives.\u201d\n\nDorian battered the Abaco Islands and the northern Bahamas on Sunday and Monday, packing 185 mile-per-hour (295 km-per-hour) winds for hours and killing at least five people as it inundated cities and destroyed as many as 13,000 homes, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. [nL2N25U06I]\n\nThe hurricane grew and picked up speed on Tuesday, moving at about 2 mph (3.2 kph) on its northwest track about 105 miles (165 km) off of Florida\u2019s east coast.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center on Tuesday warned that Dorian remained dangerous.\n\n\u201cThe headline for this #Dorian advisory is NOT that the wind speed has slightly decreased,\u201d it said on Twitter. \u201cThe combined wind, surge, and floods hazards are the same or even worse since the hurricane has become larger.\u201d\n\n\u2018PEOPLE SHOULDN\u2019T LET THEIR GUARD DOWN\u2019\n\nRodney Mills, a 71-year-old retired tractor-trailer driver and Vietnam War veteran, had shrugged off the mandatory evacuation order in Brevard County and was calmly feeding pigeons in a waterfront park in Titusville on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another storm,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d\n\nFlorida County emergency officials said they were worried that people may be more likely to ignore storm warnings in the future because the warnings for Dorian have lasted days without realization.\n\n\u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t let their guard down yet. It always can change its track,\u201d said Tod Goodyear, a spokesman for the sheriff\u2019s office in Brevard County. \u201cThe problem you sometimes come into is the complacency for the next one.\u201d\n\nAs excruciating as the uncertainty surrounding Dorian\u2019s movement has been, Clay Inghram, a 35-year-old resident of Titusville who makes a living skinning alligators said the warnings can never be too strong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s given us plenty of time to prepare,\u201d said Inghram. \u201cWe always have a little bunker bag. If it doesn\u2019t hit us, we\u2019ll have it for the next one.\u201d", "description": "Scott Renfroe was smoking cigarettes with his wife at the end of a dock in Titusville, Florida, on Tuesday morning, where he had come to see if Hurricane Dorian had brought the powerful wind gusts and rip currents that meteorologists have warned about for days.", "authors": ["Gabriella Borter", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426037231&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830HC"}
