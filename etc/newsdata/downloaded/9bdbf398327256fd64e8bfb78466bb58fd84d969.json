It would also eliminate legals limits for methane emissions from industry sites.\n\nThe oil and gas industry is the biggest contributor of methane emissions in the country, accounting for almost one-third in 2016. According to the Environmental Defense Fund, if methane leaks into the air before being used, it absorbs the sun\u2019s heat, warming the atmosphere. In the first two decades after its release, methane is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide.\n\n\u201cEPA\u2019s proposal delivers on President Trump\u2019s executive order and removes unnecessary and duplicative regulatory burdens from the oil and gas industry,\u201d EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. \u201cThe Trump administration recognizes that methane is valuable, and the industry has an incentive to minimize leaks and maximize its use.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut several major gas companies, including ExxonMobil, Shell and BP, actually oppose the move, stressing the need to reduce methane emissions in the atmosphere.\n\nSimilarly, four of the world\u2019s biggest automakers sidestepped the Trump administration at the end of July, signing a deal with California to raise standards governing gas mileage and emissions instead of backing the White House\u2019s plan to roll back Obama-era fuel efficiency rules.\n\nIn 2017, the EPA tried to suspend the regulation on methane; however, a federal appeals court blocked the move.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The new rule would loosen the requirement for the industry to install technologies limiting leaks.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/06/0/0/oil-wells_bt.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-08-29"}
