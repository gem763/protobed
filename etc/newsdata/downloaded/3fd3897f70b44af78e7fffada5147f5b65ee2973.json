Just before Clinton was officially nominated to be the party\u2019s standard-bearer, Gabbard went out of her way to play up internal divisions by tweeting a New York Daily News story that highlighted how some of Wasserman Schultz\u2019s DNC staffers privately speculated about attacking Sanders\u2019 lack of devotion to his Jewish faith.\n\nBut the Clinton campaign\u2019s hard feelings toward Gabbard haven\u2019t affected the congresswoman\u2019s trajectory nearly as much as Gabbard\u2019s own unusual path. After the 2016 election, the former Iraq War combat veteran became a political oddity in the party \u2014 she emerged as a darling of conservative commentators on FOX News. In the aftermath of this new conflict, Gabbard appeared on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show and tweeted a link to her interview, accusing Clinton of \u201cthe new McCarthyism.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s election, Gabbard met with Trump and his transition team in Trump Tower amid talk of a possible administration job as part of a visit arranged by Trump\u2019s former adviser, Steve Bannon. Gabbard described the conversation as \u201cfrank and positive.\u201d\n\nBut it was Gabbard\u2019s decision to visit Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in 2017 and her reticence in condemning him \u2014 after criticizing U.S. policy and occasionally seeming to favor Putin\u2019s involvement there \u2014 became a final breaking point for many Democrats, including Clinton.\n\nGabbard has since been favorably covered by Russian propaganda outlets, is widely seen as the right\u2019s favorite Democratic candidate and hired an adviser with Kremlin links.\n\nEven so, Sanders bristled at Clinton\u2019s characterization.\n\n\u201cTulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country. People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset,\u201d he wrote in a Monday tweet.\n\nA top Clinton adviser, Phillippe Reines, said Gabbard\u2019s fall from grace among Democrats is a matter of both party politics and policy.\n\n\u201cPolitically, in 2015 she was the first woman in Congress to endorse Sanders. So she didn\u2019t make many friends there. I\u2019d say that\u2019s 25% of the answer,\u201d Reines said via email.\n\n\u201cSubstantively, the red line she crossed was visiting Syria. It was against [U.S. government] policy,\u201d Reines said. \u201cWorse, she coddled Assad. The criticisms levied at her about Assad are 1000% valid. I mean, who the hell holds back on Assad? And the obstinacy since then is Trump-like. That\u2019s 75%.\u201d\n\nJennifer Holdsworth, who served as New Jersey state director for Hillary for America, said Gabbard made the dispute personal because she is self-serving.\n\n\u201cTulsi Gabbard has always been about whatever brings the most press to Tulsi Gabbard,\u201d Holdsworth said.\n\nSupporters of Gabbard and Sanders \u2014 as well as Trump, who defended the congresswoman Monday \u2014 say Clinton is trying to deflect blame for running a bad campaign in 2016 and losing to Trump. Clinton backers and mainstream Democrats hailed Clinton for giving voice to their suspicions and drawing attention to ongoing Russian interference that played a major role in the 2016 campaign.\n\nBoth emails cited in this story, for example, were released by the group WikiLeaks after they were hacked by Russian agents, according to U.S. intelligence officials and bipartisan congressional investigations.\n\nThe interference by Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency and other actors was chronicled in both an indictment of Russian operatives and Senate Intelligence Committee reports that showed how the foreign government used social media platforms to spread disinformation and negative information about Clinton, sometimes by boosting Trump or her other opponents.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

That law sanctioned Russia in reaction to the death of a friend of Browder \u2014 after whom the law is named.\n\n\u201cOut of all the thousands of people she could have chosen, she happened to choose the one who had first-hand experience working with a Russian agent of Vladimir Putin\u2019s,\u201d Browder said of Gabbard. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in coincidences. It\u2019s less likely to be a coincidence when you look at her policies, which are the same policy as Putin\u2019s: pro-Assad, anti-gay and pro-Trump.\u201d\n\nGabbard has renounced her past homophobic views and has criticized Trump at the Democratic debates.\n\nClinton, however, has stopped short of directly calling Gabbard a Russian asset in her comments. On the Campaign HQ with David Plouffe podcast, Clinton just said Gabbard was the preferred candidate of Russian agents who \u201chave a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d\n\nClinton did say she suspected Gabbard would run as a third-party candidate \u2014 a claim Gabbard has denied \u2014 and did call 2016 Green Party candidate Jill Stein \u201ca Russian asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know who it\u2019s going to be, but I will guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most needed.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if Clinton were singling out Gabbard, whom she didn\u2019t mention by name, her spokesman, Merrill, referenced Russian Matryoshka dolls and said, \u201cIf the nesting doll fits.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5f/62/d46a32b7493ebc5cac377bd07709/191022-tulsi-gabbard-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
