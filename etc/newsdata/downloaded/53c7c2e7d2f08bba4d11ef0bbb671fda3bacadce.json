Rick Scott calls on NBA to put human rights over profit", "language": "en", "text": "Sen. Rick Scott called on NBA Commissioner Adam Silver on Monday to put human rights over profit amid a row between China and the Houston Rockets over General Manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet showing support for the Hong Kong protests.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nScott, R-Fla., said in a statement he wanted to meet with Silver over the league\u2019s alleged support of China and its refusal to stand with Hong Kong.\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cI am requesting a meeting with Commissioner Silver immediately to discuss the NBA\u2019s involvement in Communist China. I was the first U.S. Senator to travel to Hong Kong since the protests began. What I saw was devastating,\u201d Scott said. \u201cMen and women are risking their lives to fight for the same freedom we take advantage of in this country. As Americans, it is our duty to stand together against injustice, and that means standing up to Communist China and President Xi as he violates the rights guaranteed under the 1997 handover of Hong Kong.\"\n\n\u201cWe must all put human rights above profit. And that means standing with Hong Kong. The NBA\u2019s refusal to denounce Communist China for what it is \u2013 our adversary \u2013 is shameful. The NBA should stop playing games in Communist China, and I look forward to meeting with Commissioner Silver to discuss the importance of supporting the brave individuals fighting to free themselves from the grip of Communist China.\u201d\n\nMorey, whose Rockets were playing preseason games in China, tweeted his support for the Hong Kong protesters, saying in a since-deleted tweet: \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nSeveral Chinese companies suspended work with the Rockets after Morey\u2019s tweet. The general manager said in a separate tweet he was voicing his own opinion on the issues in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d\n\nThe Rockets have a strong following in China thanks to the most famous Chinese basketball player of all time, Yao Ming, who the team drafted in 2002. Yao is also the president of the country\u2019s official basketball association.\n\n\u201cWe have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,\u201d the NBA said in a statement.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the NBA has any intention to meet with any lawmakers amid the row.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nProtests in Hong Kong have made worldwide news over the past couple of months due to growing violence between the government and those fighting for increased rights and freedom. China appears extremely sensitive to outside parties encouraging the demonstrators, especially within a group they have strong ties to.", "description": "Sen.
