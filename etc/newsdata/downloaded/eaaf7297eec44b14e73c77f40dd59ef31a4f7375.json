The effort usually always exceeds the reward, at least where time's concerned.\n\nYou climb dozens of steps to reach the slide's entry point, huffing and puffing your way to the top, only to find yourself floundering about in the exit pool mere seconds later.\n\nThis won't be the case with a new waterslide that's just opened in Malaysia\n\nAn aerial view of ESCAPE's new 1,140-foot waterslide, due to open in August. ESCAPE\n\nStretching a whopping 1,140 meters (3,740 feet) long, the ride snakes through the undergrowth at Penang's ESCAPE theme park is claimed to have smashed the previous record for world's longest waterslide held by Action Park, a theme park in Vernon, New Jersey.\n\nUnlike the New Jersey version, which is inflatable, ESCAPE's new slide is made of fiber-reinforced polymer and will be a permanent structure attached to steel poles.\n\nESCAPE's massive new slide will take riders on a four-minute journey through the jungle. Courtesy ESCAPE\n\n\"Breaking the world record was never our intention,\" said Sim Choo Kheng, CEO of ESCAPE operator Sim Leisure Group, in a statement. \"I'm always baffled by how rides are made so short and quick. I wanted to build rides that last a good few minutes.\"\n\nThe slide offers a four-minute ride that meanders its way down a 70-meter slope, passing through jungle scenery.\n\nHuffing and puffing won't be part of the experience either. Visitors will access the slide via a cable car chairlift.\n\nBringing the global spotlight to Penang\n\nPenang's capital offers culture, cuisine and so much more.\n\nThe island of Penang, off the western coast of Malaysia, is more famous for culture and cuisine than thrills.\n\nGeorge Town, the island's main city, is its top draw thanks to a colorful mix of cultures that includes Hindu and Buddhist temples, street art, Islamic mosques, British colonial architecture and ornate Chinese manor houses.\n\nRelated content Malaysia's top 40 foods\n\nPenang is also considered one of the world's top food destinations, thanks to the presence of delicious Malay, Chinese and Indian cuisine that includes dishes like Hokkien mee (fried prawn noodles) and Penang laksa.", "description": "Stretching 1,140 meters (3,740 feet) long, a new waterslide that takes four minutes to ride has opened at Malaysia ESCAPE in Penang.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190627133733-1-escape-water-slide-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-28"}
