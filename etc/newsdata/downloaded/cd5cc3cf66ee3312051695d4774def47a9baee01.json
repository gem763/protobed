I see Americans complying with the law. I see us working with gun owners, non-gun owners, local, county, state, federal law enforcement to come up with the best possible solution. I have yet to meet an owner of an AR-15 who thinks it\u2019s OK that we have these kind of mass killings in this country,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said when asked by the Washington Examiner about specifics of his plan.\n\nWhen pressed further about how he plans to enforce his proposal for those who would not comply, he responded, \u201cHow do you \u2014 how do we enforce any law? There\u2019s a significant reliance on people complying with the law. You know that a law is not created in a vacuum.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cYou\u2019ll have the input of members of Congress who are going to reflect their constituents\u2019 interests, and at the end of the day, I agree to get to a solution that protects your Second Amendment rights while protecting the lives of everyone in this country.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Kerry Picket", "Washingtonexaminer.Com News Beto-Orourke-I-Dont-See-The-Policemen-Going-Door-To-Door-With-My-Mandatory-Gun-Buyback-Plan"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
