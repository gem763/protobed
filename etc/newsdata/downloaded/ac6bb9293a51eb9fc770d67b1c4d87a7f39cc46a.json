A designer there called him \u2018a joke\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cStanding against any political action,\u201d he wrote by the cover of Evelyn Thomas\u2019s 1980s dance hit \u201cHigh Energy.\u201d \u201cI am a fashion designer refusing this association #trumpisajoke #homophobia.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Louis Vuitton, one of the brands owned by luxury goods conglomerate Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, declined to comment.\n\nAD\n\nIn the works since 2017, the new facility in rural Alvarado, Tex., employs about 150 people producing handbags that will carry \u201cMade in the USA\u201d labels, according to the Dallas Morning News. Louis Vuitton plans to continue expanding the plant and expects to have 1,000 employees there within the next few years.\n\nAD\n\nTrump visited the site Thursday in between campaign stops in Texas, touting it as an example of \u201cthe extraordinary revival of American manufacturing.\u201d Joining him were his daughter and son-in-law, senior White House advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, along with other administration officials. As cameras snapped, they toured the facility, chatted with workers and admired bags.\n\nThe president praised Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessy chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault as \u201ca great businessman but also a visionary,\u201d as well as \u201can artist, really,\u201d Women\u2019s Wear Daily reported. He joked, \u201cLouis Vuitton is a name I know very well; it\u2019s cost me a lot of money over the years,\u201d although he mispronounced the brand\u2019s name.\n\nAD\n\nArnault said the event showed his company\u2019s commitment to its American market, as well as \u201cthe commitment of President Trump to the American worker.\u201d He sought to portray the highly publicized event as nonpolitical.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are very honored to have the president of the United States. I\u2019m not here to judge any types of policies,\u201d Arnault said, according to Women\u2019s Wear Daily. \u201cI\u2019m here to work with my brand, and we are going to, over five years, have 1,000 people working here, and that\u2019s what matters.\u201d\n\nYet a backlash quickly began building. Grab Your Wallet \u2014 a campaign that encourages consumers to boycott Trump-affiliated companies \u2014 added Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessy brands to its list. To be removed, the campaign says, the company must \u201cmake a statement that LVMH regrets the appearance and does not have plans to conduct future press events with the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s criticism won praise from others in the fashion industry. Commenting appeared to have been turned off on the Instagram post by Tuesday. But earlier, the New York Times reported, Louis Vuitton creative director for accessories Camille Miceli, stylists Karla Welch and Elizabeth Stewart and designers Giambattista Valli and Julien Dossena were among those applauding it.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The artistic director of women\u2019s collections at the French fashion house called Trump \u201ca joke.\"", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KoCQ4iuNAJAQK5k9-JyvFBo43ZQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZQSCDBHR2II6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
