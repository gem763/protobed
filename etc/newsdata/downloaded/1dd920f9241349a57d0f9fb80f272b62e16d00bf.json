The beautiful game is meant to unite us, not divide us,\u201d it tweeted. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for everyone in Iran to be allowed to enjoy football matches together. RIP #BlueGirl.\u201d\n\nAfter FIFA asked for a timeline, an Iranian Sports Ministry official said in August that women fans would be allowed to attend a men\u2019s soccer World Cub qualifying match in October.\n\nSome called for FIFA to take a tougher line.\n\n\u201c@FIFAcom.
