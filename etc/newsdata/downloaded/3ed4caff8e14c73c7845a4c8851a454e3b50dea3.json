Witnesses also said Holloway pistol-whipped the groom, Mark Castiglione (right)\n\nPolice stand outside the New England Pentecostal Church after reports of a shooting on Saturday in Pelham, New Hampshire\n\nThe accused gunman was held without bail Tuesday after waiving his appearance in Hillsborough County Superior Court. A message was left for a public defender assigned to his case.\n\nThe attorney general's office said Biship Choate has been upgraded to stable condition. Bride Claire McMullen was released from a local hospital. Groom Mark Castiglione suffered minor injuries.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Benjamin Agati said authorities believe Holloway acted alone and that they were investigating whether it was connected to an earlier shooting.\n\nHolloway is the stepson of 60-year-old Luis Garcia, who was shot to death October 1 in Londonderry. The groom in the church shooting was the father of the man charged with killing Garcia. Brandon Castiglione, 24, has been charged in his murder and is jailed.\n\nThe shooting came just hours before a service was to be held for church minister Luis Garcia who was shot in the neck and killed last week. He's pictured here with his wife Patti\n\nBrandon Castiglione (left), 24, has been charged with second-degree murder in Garcia's death. He is the son of the groom who was injured in Saturday's attack. Dale Holloway (right), 37, is said to have walked into the ceremony in a New Hampshire church and opened fire in revenge for his stepfather's death\n\nPastor Garcia (pictured with wife Patti) was allegedly helping Brandon Castiglione, who is charged with his murder\n\n'I don't think I'm comfortable saying it's just a revenge shooting at this point. We are still investigating the other aspects of this,' Agati said. 'There is some connection that is there. Again, we are investigating what the exact motives are for all the players involved.'\n\nNew details have emerged about Holloway's extensive violent criminal record.\n\nHe was released from a Massachusetts prison on December 18 where he was serving time for assaulting a woman and sending threatening letters to her and her mother before his trial, according to court records obtained by the Boston Globe.\n\nIn March 2001, he was accused of stabbing a person in Boston\u2019s Downtown Crossing. At the time, Holloway\u2019s attorney said his client was trying to protect a friend who had been attacked by a gang member.\n\nCourt records from the incident described Holloway as the victim of chronic abuse by his biological father, noting that he ran away from home at age nine and moved back in with his mother.\n\n'His mother and stepfather who live in Brockton are willing to take Dale into their home and cooperate,' with court orders, the documents stated, according to the Boston Globe.\n\nIn 2003, Holloway was convicted of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and assault with intent to kill, WMUR-TV reported.\n\nIn addition to his current attempted murder charge, Holloway is also facing charges of felony assault and battery with a deadly weapon and being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n\nHis next court appearance is scheduled for October 22.\n\nNew England Pentecostal Ministries remained closed to the public on Tuesday.", "description": "Dale Holloway, 37, allegedly opened fire inside New England Pentecostal Ministries in Pelham, New Hampshire, before being tackled by guests in an alleged revenge attack.", "authors": ["Chauncey Alcorn For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/19/19662956-0-image-a-32_1570991977674.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
