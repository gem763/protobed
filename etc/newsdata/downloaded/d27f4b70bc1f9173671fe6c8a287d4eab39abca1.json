The left wants him impeached for everything else. Might as well add this to the list \u2014 particularly since he was wearing a red tie, white shirt and navy suit while speaking. Proof positive of his racism. \u2018Cause nothing says aggressive racism like donning red, white and blue.\n\nTrump has ducked his punishment for far too long.\n\nThere was Russia collusion.\n\nThere was Russia obstruction of justice.\n\nThere was Russia conspiracy, Russia conflict of interest and now, post-Robert Mueller report-slash-testimony and findings of No Collusion, the Ukraine affair.\n\nIn between? There was Brett Kavanaugh the Rapist, Part One, followed by Brett Kavanaugh the Rapist, Part Two \u2014 impeachable offenses, both. And not just for Kavanaugh; for the man who brought us Kavanaugh \u2014 Trump.\n\nAnd now? Now comes the \u201cvicious\u201d rhetoric. Which, when you think about it, is pretty much the same as labelling Hispanics \u2014 heck, all South Americans, really \u2014 as dirty scum bucket tramps.\n\nImpeach Trump. Trump hates South Americans.\n\n\u201cWhen you undermine border security,\u201d Trump said, in a special U.N. message to open border advocates, \u201cyou are undermining human rights and human dignity.\u201d\n\nImpeach! Or, as Bill Weld, ex-Massachusetts governor, might say: Just put him to death for treason already.\n\nEither, or. Potatoes, potahtoes.\n\nBut seriously, Trump just called South Americans undignified. And as everybody knows, that\u2019s KKK code for dogs.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
