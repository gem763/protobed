It would empower young men in the Premier League, set a consistent new benchmark for action in Serie A, Spain and the other big competitions.\n\nWhether he is leading from the front of harnessing the fire of his militant young stars, Gareth Southgate deserves credit for allowing them to do what needs to be done unshackled by the rules which simply do not protect black footballers.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nEngland\u2019s stars are fed up with having to rise above the kind of racist abuse they\u2019ve come to expect on away trips for club or country. Football\u2019s right-thinking contingent is sick of having to see and hear it.\n\nWe\u2019ve all had a bellyful of FIFA and UEFA - with so little black representation at decision-making level - remaining so incapable of applying the kind of punishments that act as a deterrent.\n\nThe time for soundbites, handwringing and calls to leave it to the authorities has been over for some time.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSupporters intent on racially abusing players don\u2019t care enough about the consequences.\n\nWhat do they have to fear when the fat cats at the top of the game are so weak? It is an embarrassment to this industry that racism is even an issue in 2019.\n\nSo walk off and hang the consequences. Good luck to UEFA trying to hold on to their sponsors if they try to punish the England players too.\n\nWhat commercial entity would want to be aligned to a body trying to hammer players protesting at being racially abused?\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\nOut of the chaos can come a new order that ensures black stars no longer have to put up with the kind of thing they wouldn\u2019t in any other industry.\n\nThe protocols don\u2019t work. Players like Mario Balotelli and Sulley Muntari have tried to follow it in the past and have ended up being punished themselves.\n\nEngland Under-17 coach Steve Cooper tried to follow it two years ago when Rhian Brewster claimed Morgan Gibbs-White had been racially abused by a Spanish player during the Under-17 World Cup final. FIFA ruled there was no case to answer.\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\n(Image: FIFA)\n\nThe fines don\u2019t work. Serie A issued a punishment of just under \u00a39,000 to Italian club Atalanta on Tuesday after a section of their fans racially abused Fiorentina's Dalbert.\n\nLast year Russia were made to pay just \u00a322,000 for the monkey chants directed at Paul Pogba and France during their international in St Petersburg.\n\nWhat will work is action. Football needs a sea change.
