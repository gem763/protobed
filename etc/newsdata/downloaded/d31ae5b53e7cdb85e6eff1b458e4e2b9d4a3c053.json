The Quest To Slow And Even Reverse Aging", "language": "en", "text": "VIDEO: What If Aging Wasn't Inevitable? The Quest To Slow And Even Reverse Aging\n\nScientists are better understanding why we age \u2014 and they're also better explaining the cellular changes that lead our bodies and brains to decline.\n\nThis research has led people like David Sinclair, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, and Peter Attia, a longevity doctor and oncologist, to challenge the conventional wisdom that aging is inevitable.\n\nSinclair believes the humans of the future will live decades longer than we do now, thanks to biological and technological interventions that are already being discovered.\n\nIn short: Better understanding the mechanisms of aging has led to promising treatments to slow, stop and even reverse the symptoms of growing old. And turning back the clock this way isn't just about more lifespan; it's about extending healthy, vital years. Could pills that mimic the positive benefits of exercise, at least in mice, be effective for humans? And what does this portend for the future, if we will all live decades longer?\n\nThis season of Future You is dedicated to the human body and what capabilities we will have in the coming decades.
