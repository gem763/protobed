During the conversation, Clyburn made a shocking admission: he doesn't believe the Bill of Rights would pass if it was brought forth today.\n\n\"You know what, I really believe sincerely that the climate we're in today, if the Bill of Rights the first 10 Amendments of the United States Constitution, were put before the public today, I'm not too sure we'd hold onto the Bill of Rights,\" Clyburn said. \"Especially when I see what people are doing with the Second Amendment. No telling what they'd do with the First Amendment.\"\n\n\"You really believe that?\" host David Gura asked. \"That\u2019s a startling statement. You believe that?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Clyburn replied. \u201cThere would be a strong support against the Bill of Rights. Go through the Bill of Rights and I\u2019ll tell you I run into people every day who would like to see so much of those guarantees uprooted.\u201d\n\nWhat Clyburn said should be a clarion call to conservatives. The fact that a Democratic leader in Congress has no problem admitting that people want to get rid of protections we have, like the Second Amendment, should be more than enough reason to fight the left. They want to rid of us of right to religious freedom. They want to strip us of our right to keep and bear arms. They are sometimes okay with our right to free speech, as long as that free speech is in line with their political beliefs. But this thought process isn't new. The left has always worked to undermine our rights. They just have younger, more outspoken people openly admitting they want to do it. They're no longer hiding their agenda.", "description": "Seriously?.09/09/2019 19:19:32PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2015/327/b20aa815-5282-4fac-822e-a3b7a4cf3d16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
