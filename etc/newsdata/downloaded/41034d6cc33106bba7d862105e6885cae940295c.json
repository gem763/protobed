In that case, the funeral home director is accused of discrimination \u201cbecause of sex.\u201d Specifically, he is accused of \u201csex stereotyping,\u201d because he fired a man who announced that he would start coming to work dressed in female attire.\n\nGiven the normal meaning of \u201cstereotype,\u201d both in common parlance and in caselaw interpreting Title VII, one would expect that the dress code itself was the culprit, functioning as a rigid restriction of the sexes, like requiring women to wear earrings or makeup to work. But, in this case, the employee does not ask for the right to breach the \u201cstereotypical\u201d sex-specific attire. On the contrary, he is eager to abide by it. He says he wants to wear female attire because he is a woman. The employer\u2019s alleged discrimination, then, is due to something else, something hitherto unknown in our law. It is due to his acting on \u201cstereotypical notions of how sexual organs and gender identity ought to align,\u201d as the Sixth Circuit Court put it. To put it in plain language, it is due to the employer\u2019s \u201cview\u201d that his employee who claims to be a woman actually be one. It is breathtaking.\n\nWhat is at stake here is much more than the right of an individual to free self-expression or an employer\u2019s freedom of religion to hold and act on such \u201cstereotypes.\u201d Since everyone in the workplace of that individual employee will be asked to accept that he is \u201ca woman,\u201d what is at stake is whether or not their\u2014and, by extension, every person\u2019s\u2014pre-ideological, innate knowledge of oneself as a boy or girl, imbibed quite literally at the maternal breast, will be for all practical and public purposes officially overruled as false, a \u201cstereotype.\u201d\n\nConversely, what is at stake is whether or not the alternative will be for all public and practical purposes officially true: namely, that everyone\u2019s \u201cidentity\u201d is arbitrarily and accidentally related to his or her body\u2014as ghost to machine\u2014even if the two are \u201caligned\u201d in the majority of cases, as the fashionable prefix \u201ccis\u201d means to suggest.\n\nGender and Generation\n\nWhat is it about sexual difference that the idea of any necessary \u201calignment\u201d between our \u201cidentities\u201d and our bodies is now a \u201cstereotype\u201d? It is the very thing transparent in the root of the word that \u201cgender\u201d now occupies: generation. To be sexual\u2014a boy or a girl, a man or a woman\u2014is to have been born of a mother and father, and then to be capable of generation together with the opposite sex. It is clear enough how this essential ingredient of sexual difference entails all kinds of indebtedness, entanglements, and claims, all prior to our choosing. To be born is not only to be limited to this time, place, and circumstance. Even more radically, it is to owe one\u2019s very existence to others. It is to be an heir.\n\nTo be sexual, then, is to be always already implicated with the opposite sex, which is indispensable as far as generation is concerned (however one feels about this and regardless of whether or not a generative union comes to pass). Finally, to be a potential mother or father is to be open to a future that is something outside the realm of calculation and control, a future that is \u201cbegotten not made.\u201d\n\nGiven the human condition, it does not take much to understand the temptation to extricate ourselves from these three given relations, especially the first one marked by our birth. We have been at this since (almost) the beginning, when we imagined God the Father to be the tyrant and ourselves the slaves. As moderns, we then attempted to make that \u201ctyranny\u201d the most original word on things, with our deliberately constructed \u201cstate of nature,\u201d where everyone appeared out of nowhere, unburdened by the \u201cmisfortune\u201d of being born, \u201clike Adam.\u201d \u201cGender\u201d is the most recent version of this attempt, at the level of our bodies. It is the new construct devised to drive further underground \u201ceverything that gives us birth,\u201d by hiding all the bodily evidence of it. It is set up alongside \u201csex\u201d to suggest something else, an alternative.\n\nGender as Choice\n\nNotwithstanding all the talk of people being \u201cborn that way,\u201d the gender construct means to release us precisely from the way we were born. This is particularly evident in the most prominent representative of gender theory, Judith Butler, who adamantly rejects the need for any justification for being at variance with one\u2019s bodily sex. For Butler, \u201cgender\u201d is not something we observe in ourselves, whether in our bodies or in our \u201cdeep-seated feelings.\u201d It is something we do to ourselves. It is a groundless deed \u201cperformed\u201d on ourselves, a sort of self-creation ex nihilo.\n\nIndeed, it is noteworthy that despite the many \u201cnaturalistic\u201d references to the lifelong deep-seated feelings of the respondent in the Harris Homes case, they are not used in the Sixth Circuit decision in his favor. On the contrary, there, only the most voluntarist definition of \u201cgender\u201d is used: something \u201cfluid, variable, and difficult to define . . . [having] . . . a deeply personal, internal genesis that lacks a fixed external referent.\u201d What in the end does it matter if someone has a \u201cdeep-seated feeling\u201d? Why can it not be just a choice? It is enough that the employee has declared himself to be a woman for him to be one and to be treated as such. \u201cGender\u201d has effectively vaporized the \u201cfixed external referent,\u201d all the evidence of our birth.\n\nBenedict XVI summed up this final stage of the new philosophy of sex, saying:\n\nMan and woman as created realities, as the nature of the human being, no longer exist. Man calls his nature into question. From now on he is merely spirit and will. The manipulation of nature, which we deplore today where our environment is concerned, now becomes man\u2019s fundamental choice where he himself is concerned. From now on there is only the abstract human being, who chooses for himself what his nature is to be.\n\nAnnihilating the Visible World\n\nThere is no question about the nihilistic objectives of the new philosophy of sex. Those objectives were already in play at the beginning of the sexual revolution. This was conceived by its founder, Wilhelm Reich, to be the most comprehensive of revolutions, because it rebelled against the very principle of reality itself, rejecting the \u201cfinalistic\u201d notion of sexual acts. But now, in addition to obscuring the objective reality of sexual acts, \u201cgender\u201d would prevent us from seeing what we are\u2014a man or a woman\u2014or, indeed, that we are anything at all. Taking the \u201cnew clothes\u201d of the famous Emperor in a new direction, the cloak of \u201cgender\u201d would render invisible all the naked evidence.\n\nHere is the newness of the ancient attempt to extricate ourselves from the given relations in which sexual difference entangles us. It is, as Hanna Arendt said, \u201cthe knowledgeable dismissal of [the visible].\u201d David Bentley Hart suggests a compelling reason for this. If modernity is in large part post-Christian, it cannot simply revert back to paganism and its mores. It must go further back. Since the Christian God is the One who Created all things, it must get behind everything, visible and invisible, to the only \u201cother god\u201d left: \u201cthe Nothing\u201d of spontaneous subjectivity. \u201cGender\u201d is precisely this: the attempt to free the will from any prevenient natural order. This could not have been more clearly stated than by Butler when she channeled Nietzsche, saying: \u201cthere is no \u2018being\u2019 behind doing, effecting, becoming . . . the deed is everything.\u201d But it was also chillingly stated two decades before when the feminist Shulamith Firestone called for the eventual elimination of the sex distinction itself.\n\nOne cannot, of course, just will the sex distinction away. But one can try to make it conform to the new \u201cspontaneous\u201d will. Indeed, if the temptation to cut ourselves off from all that gave us birth gets its inspiration from radical liberationist movements, it depends on the technological manipulation of human biology for any hope of success. Could we imagine the elimination of the sex distinction had it not been for the interventions pioneered by John Money in his \u201csex reassignment\u201d clinic at Johns Hopkins? Could we imagine a transgender regime were it not for the promise of further manipulations in the field of reproductive biology? That Firestone looked forward to a day when \u201cchildren would be born to both sexes equally, or independently of either,\u201d suggests otherwise. It is because of the brave new manipulation of biology that we can even think of emancipation from the prevenient natural bonds we have with our own bodies, with our parents, and with our children, to establish, in their stead, arbitrary \u201cintentional\u201d ones.\n\nGiven the assumption that the gender construct exists in view of freedom, it is astonishing how self-subversive the project actually is. There is, of course, the obvious mutilation of bodies\u2014surgical and otherwise\u2014that \u201csex-change\u201d operations entail. Perhaps more important, though, is the mutilation of the subject itself. Judith Butler is up front about this. For her, it is precisely \u201cgender\u2019s\u201d task to keep \u201cthe subject\u201d (a word she puts in scare quotes!) in a state of constant \u201camorphous non-identity\u201d in order to escape the entrapments of \u201cpower relations.\u201d\n\nLiberals\u2014like Martha Nussbaum, who balks at Butler\u2019s denial of subjectivity\u2014champion many of the same causes. Yet they do so on radically different grounds: the self-determination of the autonomous individuals, unbound prior to choice. But, here too, however much these robust subjects chart their own courses, make their own choices, and choose their bonds, they have to abstract themselves from the actual order in which they were always already embedded. In order to be \u201cfree,\u201d that is, they must resist their very (given) nature. They must oppose themselves. This couldn\u2019t be more evident than in the attempts we are now making to cancel ourselves out by \u201ctransitioning\u201d into something other than what we are\u2014another gender, even another species.\n\nThe Paradox of Freedom\n\nDavid C. Schindler speaks powerfully of this tragic paradox of modern disembodied freedom in Freedom From Reality:\n\nIn the phenomenon of the \u201ctranshuman,\u201d man appears simultaneously as the all-powerful technician and the helpless product . . . Pure power and utter powerlessness now converge into one, and man becomes the abject servant of his own limitless freedom, a passive object of active power: a slave of modern liberty.\n\nIt is uncanny how much interest there has been in the twentieth century in asexual and hermaphroditic forms of reproduction for human beings. Simone de Beauvoir, who sowed the initial seeds of the \u201csex-gender\u201d distinction, and John Money, who first used that distinction formally, were both fascinated by that possibility. It is hard not to notice the tragic paradox once again. In order to be \u201cfree\u201d and \u201csafe\u201d from each other, we would choose the form of reproduction where there is the least degree of individuality (as for example bacteria, protozoa, worms, snails, and slugs). One is reminded of the \u201cfertilizing rooms\u201d in Brave New World, where scores of identical individuals are produced through the budding of one fertilized ovum. The \u201cconditioners\u201d in The Abolition of Man who \u201ccut out their posterity in whatever shape they please\u201d also come to mind.\n\nObserving the ironic fate of the modern and postmodern gender project, which tells us to sacrifice our actual selves in order to be \u201cfree,\u201d St. John Paul II called \u201csafe sex\u201d \u201cextremely dangerous.\u201d \u201cIt is the loss of the truth,\u201d he said, \u201cabout one\u2019s own self and about the family, together with the risk of a loss of freedom and consequently of a loss of love itself.\u201d\n\nIs there another way to be free? If that has anything to do with the naked reality of flesh and blood, let us hope the Supreme Court won\u2019t act dangerously and overrule it as a \u201cstereotype.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Margaret Harper Mccarthy", "Fr.
