They are usually set during operations to clear land for palm oil and pulp plantations.\n\nIn what has become an almost annual occurrence, especially in dry years, Indonesia\u2019s neighbors are becoming alarmed by the thick haze wafting in, and raising concern about health and the impact on tourism.\n\nBut Indonesian officials caused further anger in Malaysia this week by disputing reports that the smoke was coming from their country.\n\n\u201cI have discussed this with the prime minister and he has agreed to write a letter to President Jokowi to draw his attention toward the issue of trans-boundary haze,\u201d Malaysia\u2019s environment minister, Yeo Bee Yin, told reporters, referring to Indonesian President Joko Widodo by his nickname.\n\nMahathir\u2019s office was preparing the letter and it would be delivered soon, Yeo said.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s forestry minister, Siti Nurbaya Bakar, said on Wednesday the problem should be viewed \u201cmore objectively\u201d and the smoke could have originated from fires in Malaysia.\n\nIn response, Yeo said Malaysia\u2019s data was drawn from the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre, a Singapore-based weather station that tracks forest fire \u201chotspots\u201d throughout the region.\n\nJust five hotspots were detected in Malaysia on Thursday, compared with more than 1,500 in Indonesia, Yeo said.\n\n\u201cThe data clearly shows that the haze is from Indonesia,\u201d she said.\n\nMalaysia closed hundreds of schools and sent half a million face masks to its Borneo island state of Sarawak this week, after the smoke built up to unhealthy levels.\n\nThe government had also prepared aircraft for cloud seeding in the hope of generating rain, Yeo said.\n\nSeveral parts of Southeast Asia have endured unusually dry conditions in recent months including Indonesia, which has seen very little rain because of an El Nino weather pattern, its meteorological department has said.\n\nThousands of Indonesians prayed for rain in haze-hit towns on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo on Wednesday.", "description": "Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is writing to Indonesia's leader to raise his concern about cross-border haze, Malaysia's environment minister said on Thursday, as a row over smoke from forest fires simmers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429000428&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0J6", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
