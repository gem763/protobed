The spectacle of horrified, even scandalized festivalgoers makes one wonder if these ticketholders bothered to read the late Jerzy Kosinski\u2019s source novel, which includes just about all of the brutal incidents depicted in Marhoul\u2019s film. Or perhaps these disgruntled spectators have never seen equally wrenching Holocaust films or searing World War II movies such as Laszlo Nemes\u2019s Son of Saul or Elem Klimov\u2019s Come and See.\n\nAlthough only a handful of viewers fled the Toronto International Film Festival\u2019s press screening on Sunday, it\u2019s clear that many members of the more hardened press corps had mixed feelings concerning the film. Viewed out of context, it\u2019s no doubt true that The Painted Bird might seem no more than a litany of horrors. In a scene cited by many reviewers, a deranged miller (played by Udo Kier, an actor who specializes in eccentrics and psychotics), wields a spoon and tears out the eyes of a young man he suspects desires his wife\u2014and then serves the severed eyeballs to his cats. (The scene faithfully replicates a scene in the novel.) But this admittedly gory interlude is not an arbitrarily repellent scene in a horror film; it demonstrates how war and genocide drove the inhabitants of Eastern Europe stark-raving mad.\n\nShot in gorgeous black and white CinemaScope (the beauty of the images serve as ironic counterpoint to the repellent behavior of many of the characters), the film is a darkly picaresque tale of a mute pre-adolescent Jewish boy\u2019s journey (\u201cThe Boy,\u201d played by a non-professional newcomer, Petr Kotlar) through Nazi-occupied Europe. As in the novel, Marhoul\u2019s film doesn\u2019t specify a particular national backdrop. (Much of the film, however, was shot in Ukraine). To convey the aura of geographical nebulousness vital to Kosinski\u2019s novel, the dialogue is spoken in an argot invented for the film\u2014Trans-Slavic, or what is also labeled Slavic Esperanto. From this vantage point, the devastating events of the narrative can\u2019t be attributed to any particular national character, but are the result of the killing fields (or what historian Timothy Snyder termed \u201cBloodlands\u201d; Marhoul cites Snyder\u2019s historical survey of the same name as a major influence) that resulted in the deaths of millions of civilians as Hitler and Stalin vied for supremacy during the Second World War.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s almost as if this pre-adolescent witness to history must proceed through concentric circles of hell before being redeemed\u2014and reunited with his father. \u201d\n\nAs \u201cThe Boy\u201d traverses the countryside in search of refuge from the urban milieu, where he surely would have been identified as a Jew and then killed, the film takes on the tenor of a macabre fairy tale. Some of the rural folk \u201cThe Boy\u201d meets along the way are clearly consumed with irrational hatred\u2014especially the woman who is convinced that her young visitor is afflicted by vampirism and makes him her slave. At the very moment that a sympathetic priest (played by Harvey Keitel!) takes pity on the young protagonist, the cleric turns him over to a pedophile named Garbos (Julian Sands, as a character that proves as malevolent as Kier\u2019s miller), who repeatedly rapes his young charge. It\u2019s almost as if this pre-adolescent witness to history must proceed through concentric circles of hell before being redeemed\u2014and reunited with his father.\n\nIn Kosinski\u2019s later years, he was bedeviled by accusations that he falsely claimed that the experiences recounted in the novel were autobiographical\u2014and that his shaky English at the time of the book\u2019s publication led him to plagiarize various Polish sources. Now that the dust has settled, it\u2019s possible to view Marhoul\u2019s film as a supremely faithful adaptation, even though, admittedly, it fails to reach the artistic heights of other Czech or Polish films that tackle the same terrain. While The Painted Bird may not be the easiest film to sit through, it\u2019s certainly not an example of gratuitous sensationalism.", "description": "Filmmaker V\u00e1clav Marhoul\u2019s \u201cThe Painted Bird\u201d is causing disgusted viewers to walk out at festivals\u2014including TIFF.
