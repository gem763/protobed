Pence Faults China Over Hong Kong But Urges Trade Engagement\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence criticized China\u2019s actions against protesters in Hong Kong while calling for greater engagement between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, delivering a long-anticipated critique of Beijing\u2019s human rights record as the two nations try to resolve their trade war.\n\n\u201cBeijing has increased its interventions in Hong Kong and engaged in actions that curtail the rights and liberties that Hong Kong\u2019s people were guaranteed through a binding international agreement,\u201d Pence said Thursday in a speech at the Wilson Center in Washington.\n\nAddressing the demonstrators, Pence said: \u201cWe stand with you.\u201d\n\nPence\u2019s speech comes at a crucial time in the U.S.-China relationship as the two countries remain locked in a trade war and jostle for military and commercial dominance in the Pacific. White House officials have debated for weeks how critical Pence should be, underscoring the stakes of his remarks, which come just a day before negotiators talk about progress toward agreeing on a phase one agreement over trade.\n\nThe vice president was careful to balance his criticism with an olive branch. Rather than \u201cdecoupling\u201d the two countries, the U.S. \u201cseeks engagement with China and China\u2019s engagement with the wider world,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite the great power competition that is underway and America\u2019s growing strength, we want better for China.\u201d\n\nPence\u2019s most stinging criticism of China was indirect, in remarks targeting Nike Inc (NYSE: ). and the NBA.\n\n\u201cNike promotes itself as a so-called \u2018social-justice champion,\u2019 but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,\u201d Pence said.\n\nRepresentatives for Nike (NYSE: ) and the NBA didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nDelayed Speech\n\nHe accused the NBA of \u201csiding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech.\u201d The league apologized after an executive of the Houston Rockets issued a tweet supportive of Hong Kong protesters, outraging Chinese authorities and many NBA fans in the country.\n\n\u201cThe NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime,\u201d Pence said.\n\nPence was originally supposed to deliver the speech on June 4, which marked the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square (NYSE: ) massacre. The administration ultimately delayed the speech in the hopes that President Donald Trump would land a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 leaders\u2019 summit in Osaka later that month.\n\nTrump is aiming to sign a limited trade deal with Xi next month, and a weakening American economy is chipping away at the U.S.\u2019s leverage.\n\nMeanwhile, pressure is building from Capitol Hill to stay firm, highlighting White House moves this month to sanction Chinese entities accused of connections to the surveillance and imprisonment of Muslim Uighurs in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.\n\nNational Security\n\nUnrest in Hong Kong has underscored the heated tensions as many U.S. lawmakers are pressing for legislation to support pro-democracy protesters despite a threat of retaliation from China.\n\nLeland Miller, chief executive officer of China Beige Book, said the administration is engaged in somewhat of a good-cop, bad-cop approach to China.\n\n\u201cMarkets tend to assume the administration\u2019s China policy is monolithic, swinging either hawkish or dovish based on the president\u2019s moods, but that\u2019s not really the case,\u201d Miller said. \u201cSince late August the White House has certainly turned more dovish on trade, but on the national security side, hawks continue to run the show.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say it\u2019s hard to predict how the Chinese will react but caution it\u2019s unlikely that Beijing will hit back at the vice president directly, if they don\u2019t agree with elements of the speech.\n\nTrade Pact\n\nUnder the terms of the partial trade arrangement reached earlier this month, Chinese spending on U.S. farm goods will scale to an annual figure of $40 billion to $50 billion over two years, according to the White House. China would also agree to certain intellectual-property measures and concessions related to financial services and currency.\n\nIn exchange, the U.S. delayed a tariff increase scheduled for Oct. 15 -- to 30% from 25% on about $250 billion of Chinese imports. More duties on Chinese products, targeted for Dec. 15, haven\u2019t yet been called off.\n\nWhile the limited agreement may resolve some short-term issues, several of the thorniest disputes remain outstanding. U.S. goals in the trade war center around accusations of intellectual-property theft, forced technology transfer and complaints about Chinese industrial subsidies.\n\n(Updates with no comment from Nike (NYSE: ), NBA in eighth paragraph)", "description": "Pence Faults China Over Hong Kong But Urges Trade Engagement", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC6E1AD_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
