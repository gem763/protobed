Johnson pushed for the election in response to being unable to get his deal through parliament.\n\n\"The pound will move on any move in opinion polls between now and the election. Whether we get a hung parliament or a (Labour leader Jeremy) Corbyn majority or a Tory (Conservative) majority is not clear,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.\n\n\"(The) pound is likely to trade $1.25 and $1.30 between now and then but it will be a bumpy ride,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft; Editing by Dale Hudson)", "description": "By Elizabeth HowcroftLONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Sterling held beneath $1.29 on  Wednesday after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson won  parliamentary...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
