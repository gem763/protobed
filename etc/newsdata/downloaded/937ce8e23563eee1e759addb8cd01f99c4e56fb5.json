An important achievement given all the different languages and cultures and the fact the UK is traditionally Nintendo\u2019s weakest major market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the failure of the Wii U, the Switch launched over three years later than the PlayStation 4, which now has an unassailable lead of over 100 million consoles sold, with 1 in 10 Britons estimated to own one.\n\nMicrosoft long ago stopped releasing official sales figures for the Xbox One, but it\u2019s estimated to be on around 43 million sales. That means the Switch will soon catch up with it, despite its head start, and perhaps even do so this year.\n\nOver 36 million Nintendo-published games have been sold in Europe since launch, with the nine below selling over one million copies each (it\u2019s not specified but we suspect they\u2019re in order of sales, highest to lowest):\n\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe\n\nSuper Mario Odyssey\n\nThe Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild\n\nPok\u00e9mon: Let\u2019s Go, Pikachu! and Pok\u00e9mon: Let\u2019s Go, Eevee!\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\n\nSplatoon 2\n\nSuper Mario Party\n\nNew Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe\n\n1-2-Switch\n\nNintendo has also revealed four third party games that have sold over half a million copies in Europe: Minecraft, Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, and Stardew Valley.\n\nAs ever, most video game sales occur in the run-up to Christmas, with Nintendo banking on a solid line-up that includes including Ring Fit Adventure, Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3, and Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter", "description": "Sales of the Nintendo Switch have hit a major milestone in Europe, with more than nine first party games selling over a million copies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/hacs_001_imgebr_p_01_r_ad-0_lr_1570698651.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
