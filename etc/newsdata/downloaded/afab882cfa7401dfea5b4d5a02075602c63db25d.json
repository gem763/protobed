Rather, Morey was uneducated in how speaking up on behalf of an anti-authoritarian movement could be a personal inconvenience to James.\n\nJames and his team, the Los Angeles Lakers, were in China last week amid the communist backlash to Morey\u2019s statement. James also has several personal business ties to the Chinese communist state.\n\nAs a dictatorship run through the Communist Party, the state controls the Chinese economy and no business is done without going through party leadership, either officially or through de facto means.\n\nLeBron James is worth at least $450 million, according to a 2018 Forbes report, in part due to business with the Communist Party.\n\nSupporters of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement expressed disappointment with James online. According to the Hollywood Reporter, which cataloged reactions on the Hong Kong forum LIHKG, users speculated on what interest James would have in defending the Communist Party of China, which is responsible for the systematic rape, torture, murder, indoctrination, and enslavement of between 1 to 3 million people in concentration camps, most of its victims members of the Muslim Uyghur ethnic minority.\n\n\u201cHas he been brainwashed by the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s fake news or has he been bought?\u201d a user asked. Another lamented that an American \u201cwould not cherish the precious freedom of speech they [Americans] have.\u201d\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter noted some of James\u2019 lucrative ties to Beijing:\n\nJames\u2019 business interests in China are enormous, thanks to his lifelong endorsement deal with Nike and his starring role in Warner Bros.\u2019 Space Jam 2, which was likely greenlit with the huge China box office partly in mind, given the popularity of basketball in the country.\n\nRTHK, a Hong Kong broadcaster, noted social media users began circulating a photo of James\u2019 face superimposed on Mao Zedong, the Chinese communist butcher responsible for the deaths of at least 45 million people.\n\nThe anti-authoritarian artist Badiucao, who has recently dedicated much of his work to supporting the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, added his own submission to the LeBron James condemnation artwork: a piece depicting James in a jersey for the fictional \u201cBeijing Lickers\u201d team.\n\nDear lebron James @KingJame welcome join #BeijingLickers \uff01 I hope you like your new fit and tatoo.\n\nOh I also select ur new favorite number 11. You know 11 for XI in Roman numerals.\n\nMy toon on Leborn\u2018s kowtow statement about NBA and China. #StandwithHK #FreedomHK pic.twitter.com/w63S96EitJ \u2014 \u5df4\u4e22\u8349 Badiucao (@badiucao) October 15, 2019\n\nMany prominent members of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement weighed in by sharing a statement by Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO), who attended a peaceful rally in Hong Kong this weekend, who called James\u2019 remarks \u201cgarbage.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeBron, are YOU educated on \u201cthe situation\u201d? Why don\u2019t you go to Hong Kong? Why don\u2019t you meet the people there risking their lives for their most basic liberties,\u201d Hawley suggested.\n\nThose who weighed in questioned what benefit James would receive from defending the communist regime in Beijing.\n\n\u201cIs it appropriate to blame the victim now? Who are you trying to protect, LeBron?\u201d Nathan Law, the founding chair of the pro-freedom group Demosisto, wrote on Twitter.\n\nHong Kong residents began pouring out onto the streets by the millions in June, when their Legislative Council proposed a bill that would allow the Communist Party to extradite anyone present in Hong Kong if accused of violating Beijing\u2019s draconian laws. After two months of protests, Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced she would ask the legislature to withdraw the bill. Protesters are still making four demands of their government: freedom for political prisoners, direct election of lawmakers, an independent investigation into police brutality, and for officials to stop calling them \u201crioters,\u201d as the overwhelming majority of protesters are peaceful.\n\nThis week, communist dictator Xi Jinping warned \u201cseparatists\u201d \u2013 referring to the sovereign nation of Taiwan as well as dissidents in Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang \u2013 that China would leave \u201ctheir bodies smashed and bones ground to powder\u201d if they did not submit to his will.\n\nChina is literally grinding the bones of dead Uyghurs to powder in Xinjiang, where the Agence France-Press (AFP) found human remains lazily strewn about the rubble left behind at sites that used to hold ancient cemeteries the Communist Party had razed to erase the presence of the non-Han Chinese in the region.\n\nJames endorsed China\u2019s brutality in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and elsewhere in remarks Tuesday, saying that Morey, by supporting a peaceful pro-democracy movement, was not being \u201ceducated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke,\u201d James said of Morey. \u201cSo many people could have been harmed not only financially but physically, emotionally and spiritually. So just be careful with what we tweet, and we say, and we do.\u201d\n\nJames added that freedom of speech brings \u201ca lot of negative\u201d with it to America.\n\nHe later attempted to clarify, in an attempt to quell widespread condemnation he dismissed as \u201cconfusion,\u201d that he was not supporting rampant human rights abuses in China for their own sake, but rather doing so for his personal benefit.\n\n\u201cI do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk About that,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe added that Morey \u201ccould have waited a week\u201d to support the Hong Kong protests so that James would not face difficult questions personally while in China.\n\nWhile no NBA affiliated person has openly condemned James\u2019 remarks at press time, Boston Celtics player Enes Kanter appeared to criticize James without naming him. \u201cWow dude!\u201d he wrote on Twitter, adding an emoji of a man slapping his forehead. He later detailed his own fight with Chinese ally Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of his native Turkey, who has imprisoned his father and antagonized him and his family for being followers of the America-based cleric Fethullah Gulen.\n\n-Haven\u2019t seen or talked to my family 5 years\n\n-Jailed my dad\n\n-My siblings can\u2019t find jobs\n\n-Revoked my passport\n\n-International arrest warrant\n\n-My family can\u2019t leave the country\n\n-Got Death Threats everyday\n\n-Got attacked, harassed\n\n-Tried to kidnap me in Indonesia FREEDOM IS NOT FREE \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019\n\nJames\u2019 pro-China outburst followed the abrupt silence of Chinese state media that descended on Friday, when the NBA began to calculate that the backlash from pro-freedom Americans to their bottom line was greater than that of the orchestrated outrage of the Chinese communists. At press time, the four major English-language Chinese state outlets \u2013 Xinhua, the Global Times, China Daily, and the People\u2019s Daily \u2013 have not remarked on James\u2019 comments.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "NBA player LeBron James' condemnation of Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey has triggered a widespread backlash in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/hong-kong-LeBron-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
