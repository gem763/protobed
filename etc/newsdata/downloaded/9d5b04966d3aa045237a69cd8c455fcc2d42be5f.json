David Ake/AP U.S. busts 'massive' Iranian hacking scheme\n\nThe Justice Department on Friday revealed charges against an Iranian hacking ring that prosecutors say spent years pilfering research and documents from over 100 American universities and government agencies.\n\nGeoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, in a statement called it a \"massive and brazen cyber-assault\" and \"one of the largest state-sponsored hacking campaigns ever prosecuted\u201d by U.S. officials.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe case is the second time federal prosecutors have charged hackers for intrusions on behalf of the Iranian government, coming almost exactly two years after DOJ indicted seven Iranians for a series of coordinated cyberattacks against the U.S. financial sector and for infiltrating a New York dam in 2013.\n\nBut Friday's charges represent the takedown of a broader \u2014 and more purposeful \u2014 digital theft campaign. It's also the first time DOJ has indicted government-linked hackers for infiltrating American government offices.\n\n\u201cThe government of Iran systematically and methodically hacked into our country\u2019s computer networks with the intent to steal as much information as possible,\" Berman told reporters at a Friday press conference.\n\nDOJ specifically targeted the Iran-based Mabna Institute, which it says was founded in 2013 \"to assist Iranian universities and scientific and research organizations in stealing access to non-Iranian scientific resources.\"\n\nOver the course of four years, prosecutors say, hackers working for the Mabna Institute stole at least 31 terabytes of data from 144 American universities, totaling $3.4 billion in intellectual property. The group also cracked into 176 foreign universities, DOJ said.\n\nAccording to court documents, the hackers compromised these systems by sending emails to professors, posing as other professors, that tricked targets into giving up their login credentials.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

They also infiltrated the United Nations and the United Nations Children's Fund, according to court documents.\n\nThe hackers conducted \u201cmany\u201d of the intrusions \u201con behalf of\u201d Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, \u201cas well as other Iranian government and university clients,\u201d according to DOJ.\n\n\"The hackers targeted innovations and intellectual property from our country\u2019s greatest minds,\" Berman said.\n\nThe Treasury Department also slapped sanctions on the Mabna Institute and the nine charged individuals.\n\nAt Friday's press conference, Sigal Mandelker, Treasury's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, called the efforts an \"extraordinary example of the Iranian regime\u2019s willingness to use cyber-enabled and other illicit means to enrich itself.\"\n\nWhile none of the charged hackers have been detained, Berman said the indictments would restrict their lives.\n\n\"The only way they will see the outside world is through their computer screens, but stripped of their greatest asset \u2014 anonymity,\" he said in a statement.\n\nAnd FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich vowed that they would continue to hunt down the alleged hackers.\n\n\"People travel. They take vacations,\" he told reporters. \"They make plans with their families. And having your name, face and description on a wanted poster makes moving freely much more difficult.\u201d\n\nFriday's move is the latest in a growing trend for U.S. prosecutors \u2014 indicting hackers linked to foreign governments.\n\nFor years, the government was hesitant to take such a step. Definitively attributing cyberattacks was difficult, and there was little \u2014 if any \u2014 chance the indicted hackers would ever see the inside of a courtroom. And some officials also pointed to the fear of having America's online espionage efforts revealed.\n\nBut investigators became better at concretely identifying digital culprits. And more policy experts started touting the \"name and shame\" theory \u2014 the idea that shedding light on other governments\u2018 digital malfeasance could encourage international condemnation and deter such behavior.\n\nThe Obama administration slapped the first charges on foreign government hackers in 2013, when it indicted five members of the Chinese military for infiltrating American corporations.\n\nDOJ prosecutors then put Iran in their crosshairs in 2016 with the indictments of seven Tehran-linked individuals for launching a spate of digital assaults on the financial sector that knocked online banking sites offline for hundreds of thousands of people. One of the hackers was also charged with illegally accessing the control system of a dam in New York.\n\nAnd just last year, DOJ indicted two Russian spies for hacking into tech giant Yahoo and stealing data on 500 million users. The landmark case represented the first time the U.S. had ever filed criminal cyber charges against Moscow officials.\n\n\"This type of public identification helps to deter state-sponsored computer intrusions by stripping hackers of their anonymity and by imposing real consequences,\" said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein at Friday's press conference.\n\nThe Obama and Trump administrations have also publicly accused North Korea and Russia for various other cyberattacks since 2014, often imposing economic sanctions afterward.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to pursue this strategy,\" Rosenstein added. \"I think that it will have an impact.\"\n\n\n\nCLARIFICATION: The case is the second time the Justice Department has indicted hackers who conducted intrusions of behalf of the Iranian government.
