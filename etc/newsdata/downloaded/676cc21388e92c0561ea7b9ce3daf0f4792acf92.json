The FBI declined to comment on the Huawei allegations.\n\nThe details of the alleged U.S. attempts to infiltrate Huawei come as the company is facing growing pressure from the Trump administration, adding to many months of allegations in Washington and in many European countries that the telecom giant is a security risk due to its close ties to Beijing.\n\nIn a Tuesday news release, Huawei asserted that law enforcement officers were deployed to \"threaten, menace, coerce, entice, and incite\" current and former employees to disparage the company. It also claimed the U.S. has \"unlawfully\" searched, detained and arrested Huawei employees.\n\n\"Our investigative techniques comply with the law and all subjects of investigations enjoy the same rights to due process afforded by our Constitution\" \u2014 U.S. Department of Justice\n\nThe U.S. government has also targeted the company's business partners and rivals and attempted to infiltrate its internal computer systems, Huawei alleges.\n\n\"For the past several months, the US government has been leveraging its political and diplomatic influence to lobby other governments to ban Huawei equipment,\" a Huawei statement read. \"Furthermore, it has been using every tool at its disposal \u2014 including both judicial and administrative powers, as well as a host of other unscrupulous means \u2014 to disrupt the normal business operations of Huawei and its partners.\"\n\nThe press release did not provide evidence of the U.S. pressure, and a spokesperson did not provide additional information, but the document obtained by POLITICO adds details to the company's allegations.\n\nIt describes in some detail at least three instances in which Huawei employees were approached or involved in attempts to gain confidential company information.\n\nThe FBI visited a U.S. Huawei employee\u2019s home on August 29 and asked them \u201cto be an informant and assist FBI in acquiring information on the company,\u201d according to the document.\n\nIn April, diplomatic officials applied similar pressure to two employees of Huawei\u2019s Colombia office when the employees tried to get personal visas to enter the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe officials of the US Embassy asked about their employer and position,\u201d the document alleges. \u201cThen in a separate room, the officials asked these two employees to be advisors to the US government.\u201d\n\nThe Justice and State departments declined to comment on the allegations. However, in a statement to POLITICO, the DOJ said, \"In all matters, our investigative techniques comply with the law and all subjects of investigations enjoy the same rights to due process afforded by our Constitution and safeguarded by an independent judiciary.\u201d\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn August 23, according to the document, a Huawei employee in Spain received a call from someone purporting to be a fellow employee based on the U.S. This person asked for \u201ca list of people who directly report to a particular executive and a diagram of organizational structure,\u201d supposedly to prepare \u201cnew employee orientation materials.\u201d\n\nThe caller, who posed as a real former Huawei employee, also asked for \u201cthe contact information of an IT employee.\u201d The Spanish employee did not provide any information, Huawei said.\n\n\u201cPeople familiar with the situation said that similar things had happened multiple times this year,\u201d the Huawei document says. \u201cIt\u2019s very likely that the US government has been doing this to obtain more internal information of Huawei in relation to their investigation.\u201d\n\nOther information in the document disputed allegations of Huawei's attempts to steal diamond glass technology from Akhan Semiconductor, as reported in Bloomberg Businessweek.", "description": "Chinese tech giant publicly accused America of intimidating and threatening employees.", "authors": ["Laurens Cerulus", "Steven Overly", "Eric Geller", "Laura Kayali", "Mark Scott", "Joshua Posaner"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1160513776-1200x628.jpg"}
