It\u2019s one thing for Joe Biden to run on Obama-stalgia. It\u2019s another entirely to recycle that administration\u2019s claim that ended up being Politifact\u2019s Lie of the Year in 2013.\n\nThe irony this time is that Biden\u2019s trying to stave off outright socialized medicine with this old canard rather than disguise a stealth version of it. Well, mostly, anyway:\n\n.@JoeBiden on his health-care plan: \u201cIf you like\u201d your policy, \"you can keep it\" pic.twitter.com/Id8GIdr9wP \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) October 24, 2019\n\nBIDEN: \u2026 the choice in affordable health care, covered by a public option, a Medicare-like option. With that, under my plan, if you negotiated an agreement for health care with your \u2014 with your employer, union or otherwise, and you like it because you\u2019ve given up wages to get it, you can keep it. It should be your choice, but if you don\u2019t like it, if you don\u2019t like it, you can leave it. And you can afford, you can afford a plan that\u2019s subsidized in the health-care policy.\n\nThis would qualify as a contender for Lie of the Year in 2019, too, and Biden even explains why. The \u201cpublic option\u201d got dumped out of ObamaCare in 2009 because it was such an obvious stalking horse to use government subsidies as a way to price private insurers out of the health-coverage business. Thanks to the subsidies Biden brags about here, the public option could and most definitely would operate at a loss, which would keep the prices artificially so low that health insurers wouldn\u2019t be able to compete. It\u2019s a back door to the same Medicare for All system that Biden\u2019s supposedly arguing against in this clip. This isn\u2019t a competing plan; it\u2019s just a less honest way to get to the same result.\n\nI get that Biden\u2019s whole appeal in this cycle is as a rerun, a sort of Happy Democratic Days in which Barack Obama is Richie and Biden\u2019s more of a Chachi. One would think that Biden would know better, though, than to repeat the same episode in which their administration jumped the shark on health care. That wasn\u2019t just about the \u201cyou can keep your plan\u201d lie, but also the embarrassing rollout of the ObamaCare exchanges and the skyrocketing premiums and deductibles that ObamaCare produced shortly afterward.\n\nAlso, this clip suggests that Biden has more problems than just recycling bad material. He sounds tired, repetitive, and demonstrates no rhetorical or physical dynamism at all. He seems glued to the podium, although it is only a 30-second clip. The argument itself is also less than fully coherent; who hasn\u2019t \u201cgiven up wages\u201d to gain health-care benefits from employers? That describes everyone covered in an employer-based insurance plan, unions or not.\n\nBiden might have reason to relax, however, as this isn\u2019t the dumbest health-care claim from Democrats today. That crown goes to Minnesota\u2019s own Rep. Ilhan Omar, who linked a New York Times story to claim that the Trump administration\u2019s Medicaid rules killed an infant in Texas. The Daily Caller actually read the article and found out just how ignorant Omar can be.
