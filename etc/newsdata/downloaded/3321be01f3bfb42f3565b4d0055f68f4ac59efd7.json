The oft-memed \u201cpress F to pay respects\u201d moment from Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is a prime example of this, because when the rest of your game is built around the generally limited verbs of \u201cshoot, throw grenade, melee attack,\u201d it can be hard to involve the player in moments of emotional depth in satisfying ways. Because of this, many shooters tend to avoid this subject matter altogether. This lineage is why one of the weekly quests in Destiny 2: Shadowkeep, involving the player helping an NPC work through the grief of losing people close to her , has been a surprisingly pleasant balm to what is, on average, a more hamfisted approach.\n\n\n\n---- Spoilers for Shadowkeep\u2019s Campaign and Post-Campaign Quests----\n\nShadowkeep\u2019s campaign begins with Eris Morn, an ex-guardian whose tragic backstory and constant black tears have earned her the title of Destiny\u2019s Resident Goth (sorry, Peter Stormare) while exploring the depths of the Moon. Eris has a long history with the moon; her and a fireteam of five companions were the first to venture into the depths of the Hellmouth, but Eris was the only one to escape alive. She found a Pyramid ship, an ancient enemy that has been teased as being Destiny\u2019s mysterious \u201cDarkness,\u201d the often mentioned but never portrayed evil that caused human society to collapse. The Darkness are the reason there are abandoned outposts on just about every inner planet of our solar system, and the only reason we weren\u2019t completely wiped out is because the Traveler somehow managed to...fend them off? The Darkness has always been framed as a mysterious entity, a past trauma repressed by the collective psyche of humanity in an effort to focus on rebuilding.\n\nScreenshot courtesy of Bungie\n\nBut now, that threat is back, and it\u2019s using the past as a weapon. Throughout the Shadowkeep campaign, you\u2019re tasked with taking what the game calls Nightmare Hunts, where you track down and kill physical manifestations of past enemies created by the Pyramid ship.\n\nWe even get enemies from as far back as Destiny 1, with a specific mission recreating the boss encounter from the Crota\u2019s End raid. These hunts are pretty fun missions, but the weight they\u2019re meant to carry fell flat for me. I\u2019d already killed Crota a million times, and the reference was neat, but it didn\u2019t feel like I was being \u201chaunted by my past.\u201d And for players that began playing with Destiny 2, I can only imagine their confusion at the encounter of a boss they\u2019ve never met being talked up as part of \u201cthe collective pain\u201d that the Pyramid ship is taking advantage of.\n\nLuckily, the story\u2019s focus becomes less about you being haunted, and more about Eris and her past. As the players go on these hunts, the ship sends phantoms of Eris\u2019 old fireteam to haunt her. As you complete missions and quests, new ghosts continue to appear. She attempts to ignore them, but you can tell through her demeanor that the stress continues to build. Even when offered help from Ikora Rey, the only member of the Vanguard she considers a friend, Eris brushes it aside, replying that \u201cwe have work to do,\u201d while gesturing to the player.\n\nScreenshot courtesy of the author.\n\nThis piling of responsibility, ignoring stress, and then ignoring help is an all-too-familiar cycle, one many folks will be familiar with well outside of Destiny. Even though it feels like depression and therapy are in the process of being destigmatized, there\u2019s still a lot of work to do before it\u2019s widely accepted. I\u2019ve personally seen the effects of that stigma, close friends that once refused to go to therapy for fear of being \u201cweird.\u201d Too many people still fall into the trap of thinking they don\u2019t need help and can pull through on their own, and sometimes that means throwing themselves headfirst into work. Eris typifies this dangerous cycle, never stopping to take stock of her own well being as she continues to help the player with their mission while the Pyramid ship continues to haunt her.\n\nIkora\u2019s response to being brushed off is also feels typical of people unequipped with responding to friends with depression. Instead of sticking around and trying to talk to her friend, she sends Vanguard robots to stand watch and protect her at her outpost on the Moon, an area she\u2019s already warded enemies from entering. It all proves to be an unnecessary gesture that misses the forest for the trees. When the forest is a manifestation of Eris\u2019s old fireteam that follows her everywhere, you have to wonder why Ikora thought Robots With Guns would help at all.\n\nScreenshot courtesy of the author. The first weekly memory quest.\n\nAfter the campaign ends, you\u2019re sent on a quest to find an old trinket from one of Eris\u2019 fireteam members. As you fight enemies and explore the Moon, you find pieces of an old necklace that you begin to string back together. Eventually, through completing a series of combat objectives, you\u2019re able to recreate the necklace and bring it back to Eris. She tells you about that fireteam member, how they joined her and what they were like. She works through her grief in front of you, and then, only then, is that phantom finally dispersed. It\u2019s a touching moment in a game made up of mostly combat and people talking in your ear.\n\nThere has been a new quest to help Eris each week since the launch of Shadowkeep, each dealing with the memory of a different member of her fireteam.The fact that they\u2019re weekly quests not only works within Destiny\u2019s weekly reset schedule, but also motions towards the fact that facing trauma and grief takes time. There\u2019s no easy and quick way through, it\u2019s an ongoing process.\n\nThis is by no means the best depiction of working through grief in games, but for a game who\u2019s verbs are all combat-focused, Shadowkeep has managed to make such moments land with a tenderness and weight you don\u2019t normally expect, especially so from a game whose main player motivation can be \u201cmaking the numbers go up.\u201d", "description": "Destiny\u2019s weekly quests are a touching look at grief and remembrance.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5dadb595d78dc8000a3db3a9/lede/1571666723766-Shadowkeep_keyart_16-9_EN.jpeg?crop=0.426xw:0.425xh;0.2401xw,0xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
