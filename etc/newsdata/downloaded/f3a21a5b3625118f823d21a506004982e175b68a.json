There will be a lot of totting-up of votes this week as MPs consider Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal and a series of possible amendments to it.\n\nThere are 650 MPs in the Commons, but with the seven non-sitting Sinn F\u00e9in representatives, as well as the Speaker, John Bercow, and his two deputies not taking part in votes, the magic number for any victory is 320.\n\nAfter byelection losses, expulsions and resignations, Johnson\u2019s Conservatives hold 288 seats, meaning that even with the 10 Democratic Unionist party (DUP) members backing the government \u2013 which they are not doing on the deal \u2013 he is some way short. However, Labour is also divided and there are now 35 independent MPs, making the situation very fluid.\n\nHere\u2019s how the numbers might look for various options.\n\nJohnson\u2019s deal\n\nMinisters are hopeful that if they are given a free run at pushing through Johnson\u2019s plan \u2013 when they tried to do so on Saturday, it was amended to delay the moment of truth \u2013 the numbers will be there.\n\nCurrent projections put the vote at a dead heat. Johnson\u2019s side is boosted by 20 former Tories who now sit as independents but are supportive, and various other independents including Brexit-minded former Labour MPs such as Ian Austin and Frank Field.\n\nThe key will be how many current Labour MPs the government can tempt over. On Saturday, six voted with the government against Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment to delay approval of Johnson\u2019s deal \u2013 Kevin Barron, Ronnie Campbell, Jim Fitzpatrick, Caroline Flint, Kate Hoey and John Mann. They could all be expected to back the deal.\n\nThe question is whether any more Labour MPs, particularly from leave-backing constituencies, could follow. The signs are mixed. One possibility, Gloria de Piero, has said she will instead work to support a customs union amendment.\n\nAll-UK customs union\n\nThis appears to be the favoured option of Labour, whose hope would be to attach an amendment on it to the Brexit deal legislation. However, the government is vehemently opposed to a customs union and would not accept a deal so amended.\n\nWhen MPs held non-binding indicative votes in April on a series of Brexit options, a customs union came as close as any to gaining approval, losing by 276 votes to 273, with a number of abstentions.\n\nThe numbers could be similarly close now. The combined total of Labour\u2019s 245 MPs, 35 from the SNP, 19 Lib Dems plus 10 from Plaid Cymru, the Independent Group of Change and the Greens gets to 309, short of the magic number. Some of the 20 ex-Tory independents have been sympathetic to a customs union before (the indicative vote on a customs union was instigated by Ken Clarke), but some could be receptive to the government urging to eschew the plan now.\n\nLabour\u2019s big hope had been to get the DUP onside after the party was cut adrift by Johnson with his deal, which leaves Northern Ireland subject to an EU-style customs regime. But on Monday one DUP MP, Jim Shannon, said the party would not back such a move.\n\nSecond referendum\n\nThe idea of an amendment making any Brexit deal conditional on a second referendum to approve or reject it has been mooted for many months. However, MPs supporting the People\u2019s Vote campaign have repeatedly declined to push the matter, mindful that it probably does not have the required support.\n\nA second referendum proposal during April\u2019s indicative votes lost by 292 votes to 280, and it is uncertain how much more support such a plan could pick up beyond the same MPs who seem likely to support a customs union. In this instance the ex-Tory rebels are notably less sympathetic for the most part.\n\nHowever, it seems such an amendment will be tabled. Rather than being put forward by the Labour frontbench, the most likely version is one proposed by Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, two Labour MPs who have repeatedly pushed the idea of any Brexit deal being contingent on a confirmatory referendum.", "description": "Could the Commons back PM\u2019s deal, an all-UK customs union or a second referendum?", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/844f2b93886946d1f635562283e15bf3f3fc3a48/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cc84913e4dbde0263c757bf866e53d37", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
