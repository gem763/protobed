Step away from the computer\n\nDon\u2019t become a Google doctor! Research is great, but too much can end up causing you unwanted anxiety. It\u2019s enough that you\u2019re being bombarded with info from your mother-in-law \u2013 so no need to add extra stress by spending hours on the internet researching all the things that could go wrong.\n\nSister Nelisiwe suggests limiting the amount of time you spend on the Internet. \u201cDon\u2019t get to a point where it consumes your entire life and fuels your paranoia,\u201d she says.\n\n2. Self-care\n\nTake time to care of your number one priority \u2013 yourself! After all, a healthy mom means a healthy baby. Set time aside each day to clear your mind and do something you enjoy doing.\n\nSister Nelisiwe suggests meditation as it will help keep you calm and level-headed when reacting to stressful situations during your pregnancy.\n\nRead more: 5 things you need to know about sex after pregnancy\n\n3. Rest\n\nAs difficult as it may be, take some time to yourself and rest whenever possible\u2026 because when baby comes you might never sleep again (kidding)!\n\nWhether it\u2019s going to bed early, taking breaks throughout the day, having brunch with the girls or a holiday \u2013 ensure that you are stress-free and as rested as possible.\n\n4. Eat healthy foods\n\n\n\nEating good healthy food will not only be good for you and baby, but it will make you feel good too. Eating a bowl of oatmeal will give you a dose of B vitamins which will enhance the brain\u2019s production of serotonin, the happy hormone, helping to reduce mood swings.\n\n5. Exercise\n\nExercising will get a rush of endophines going, helping lower your stress and anxiety levels. Exercising while pregnant has heaps of benefits, such as offering relief from an aching back, helping with constipation and keeping your weight at a healthy level.\n\nRead more: 5 foods with more mood-boosting benefits than chocolate\n\n\n\n6. Don\u2019t over do it\n\nSister Nelisiwe suggests not overloading yourself with work. Don\u2019t commit to long hours or to stressful amounts of work. Listen to your body and know your limits. Try to plan your daily tasks to avoid unnecessary stress and anxiety.\n\nAlso try not to make any major changes such as moving house \u2013 adjusting to having a baby is enough of a challenge.\n\n7. Build a good support network\n\nIt\u2019s vital to have a good support network around you during pregnancy. This could be anyone from your partner, parent, friends or healthcare professional. Who is in your support network is all dependent on how much you trust them and your level of interaction. Having supportive people in your life can make all the difference to how you deal with stress, anxiety and negative emotions.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "Don't let the baby blues get you down.", "authors": ["Chandr\u00e9 Davids"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7035/c895dcf0e0344877ba7c10ab65036797.png", "published_at": "2018-02-20"}
