International human rights groups were more unequivocal.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Patuel of Amnesty International denounced \u201ca shameful attempt by Guinean authorities to stifle dissent by any means necessary\u201d. But one major power seemed unperturbed.\n\nMr Conde\u2019s ruthless response to protests against his apparent efforts to cling to power not only suited Russia, it seems probable that they were tacitly endorsed by the Kremlin.\n\nOn Wednesday, Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, will host leaders from 35 African states at a summit in the Black Sea resort of Sochi as he seeks to consolidate Moscow\u2019s growing influence in the world\u2019s poorest continent.\n\nRussia may lack the heft of its rivals, able neither to match the West in aid nor China in terms of infrastructure financing, but it does have other resources with which to woo African leaders, particularly those of a more authoritarian bent.\n\nVladimir Putin is looking to expand Russian influence More\n\nNot only has Russia sold arms to 18 African states over the past decade, its mercenaries have fanned out across the continent to offer protection and other services to receptive governments.\n\n\u201cPolitical technologists\u201d have also allegedly mounted disinformation campaigns in several recent African elections. In return, Russia has won concessions to mine minerals and secured backing from African delegates at the United Nations.\n\nRussia\u2019s blossoming relationship with Mr Conde is an example of just how successful its muscular Africa policy can be. Guineans are meant to elect a new president next year. Having served two five-year terms, Mr Conde is constitutionally barred from standing again, but has made it increasingly clear that he is not yet ready to surrender the presidency.\n\nAt least four people have been killed in Guinea's capital after police fired tear gas and bullets Monday to disperse thousands of opposition supporters Credit: AP More\n\nTo do so, Guinea will need an entirely new constitution, plans for which have already been advanced by Mr Conde\u2019s ruling party.\n\nThe opposition has accused the president of seeking to ease its path by stacking the constitutional court, taming the electoral commission and delaying parliamentary elections by more than a year to protect his narrow legislative majority. Russia has openly given its cover to Mr Conde\u2019s efforts.", "description": "When police shot dead nine pro-democracy protesters in Guinea this week, Western embassies quietly shared their misgivings with the country\u2019s president, Alpha Conde.
