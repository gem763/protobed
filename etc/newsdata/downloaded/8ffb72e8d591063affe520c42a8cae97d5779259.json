Roger Williams, R-Texas, asked the 35-year-old billionaire whether he's a capitalist or a socialist.\n\n\"Congressman,\" Zuckerberg said, suppressing a laugh, \"I would definitely consider myself a capitalist.\"\n\nZuckerberg's testimony came several weeks after he livestreamed a Q&A session at Facebook, during which he was asked to respond to Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders' declaration that billionaires should not exist.\n\n\u201cI understand where he\u2019s coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have but on some level, no one deserves to have that much money.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced plans almost four years ago to donate 99 percent of their Facebook shares to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a company that uses technology to solve challenges like eradicating disease and reforming the criminal justice system, according to its website.\n\nThe full amount is pledged over the course of Zuckerberg's life, and he will not give more than $1 billion each year in the immediate future.

Elizabeth Warren to break up big technology companies.\n\nHe vowed to \u201cgo to the mat\u201d to fight her plan to break up companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google if she\u2019s elected.\n\n\u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\u201d Zuckerberg said at the time. \u201cAnd does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "\"Congressman,\" Zuckerberg said, suppressing a laugh, \"I would definitely consider myself a capitalist.\"", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Zuckerberg-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
