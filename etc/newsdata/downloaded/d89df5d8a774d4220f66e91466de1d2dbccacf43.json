The smart glasses do not have a display or camera \u2013 seeking to avoid the stigma associated with Google\u2019s Glass \u2013 but can be equipped with prescription lenses.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Echo Loop smart ring vibrates when you get a message.

But the Echo Buds, competitors to Apple\u2019s AirPods, will get a wide release costing \u00a3119.99 in the UK and $129.99 in the US.\n\nThey feature a true wireless design, Bose active noise reduction technology and, of course, integrated Alexa functionality similar to that provided by Siri with second-generation AirPods.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Echo Buds launch Amazon into the ultra-competitive field of true wireless earbuds.

Entering new categories with new features and disrupting aggressively on price.\n\n\u201cWith Echo Frames and Echo Loop Amazon is offering consumers the opportunity to help it experiment in new areas. The more Alexa usage grows, the lower hardware pricing becomes. This should be a significant concern for Amazon\u2019s competitors.\u201d\n\nAmazon also launched a deluge of other Alexa-powered devices, including a smart oven, an updated Echo Dot (\u00a359.99) with an integrated clock, an improved standard Echo (\u00a389.99), the smaller and cheaper Echo Flex (\u00a324.99) that plugs straight into the wall, a premium sound Sonos One competitor called the Echo Studio (\u00a3189.99), an 8in Echo Show 8 (\u00a3119.99) smart display and the Echo Glow smart lamp for kids. It also launched a pet tracker called Fetch powered by its new long-range, low-power networking technology called Sidewalk.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The best-selling Echo Dot gains an LED display for the time, timers and other limited information, aimed at replacing the alarm clock.

Errant activations and the potential for them to end up recording private conversations have been a focus of privacy concerns.\n\nAmazon\u2019s head of devices, Dave Limp, said the company was committed to privacy, making it \u201cfoundational\u201d to every device, arguing a service \u201ccan\u2019t be private unless you give [customers] this control\u201d over use of their data and recordings.\n\nThe firm also launched its first celebrity voice for Alexa: actor Samuel L Jackson, which will cost $4.99 and be available in a \u201cclean\u201d version for those who do not want to hear Jackson curse. Amazon said other celebrity voices would be added next year.", "description": "Echo Frames, Loop and Buds launched along with series of updates to previous products", "authors": ["Samuel Gibbs"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dee7528890f228d3563afeb23078b731562f967/387_380_3086_1853/master/3086.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=32a754f48a3a234eb66f339d9174104d", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
