Al Green,\u201d Mr Trump wrote.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the congressman had in fact said that exact quote, though in a TV interview in May he said: \u201cI\u2019m concerned that if we don\u2019t impeach the president, he will get re-elected.\u201d\n\nDespite the Democratic leadership\u2019s reticence, the committee pressed forward, with chair Jerrold Nadler saying: \u201cWe have a constitutional, historical, and moral obligation to fully investigate these matters.\u201d\n\nBefore the vote, he said: \u201cLet us take the next step in that work without delay.

Mr Nadler has said that the committee will push forwards with impeachment hearings this autumn, bolstered by lawmakers on the panel who roundly support the move.\n\nThe vote on Thursday set rules for those hearings, empowering staff to question witnesses, allowing some evidence to remain private and permitting the president\u2019s counsel to respond to testimony.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Ms Pelosi has said she wants to see what happens in court before making any decisions on impeachment.\n\nThe first hearing under the new impeachment rules would be with Corey Lewandowski on 17 September.\n\nMr Lewandowski, the president\u2019s former campaign manager, was frequently mentioned in former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, which the committee has been investigating.\n\nAccording to the report, Mr Trump asked Mr Lewandowski to deliver a message to then-attorney general Jeff Sessions, asking him to limit the federal probe.\n\nThe committee has also invited two other witnesses mentioned in the report, former White House aides Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter. The White House has previously blocked former employees from testifying, but Mr Lewandowski never officially worked for the White House.\n\nAssociated Press contributed to this report", "description": "The Democratic-controlled House Judiciary Committee has passed a vote to set the\u00a0rules for hearings on impeaching Donald Trump\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a move seen as a major step forward in the panel\u2019s investigations into the president.\u00a0 The resolution passed on Thursday is a technical step, and the committee would still have to introduce impeachment articles against Mr Trump and win approval from", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/10/19/front-trump-11-september-5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
