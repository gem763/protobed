Ineos, which sponsored the event, is a chemical giant that\u2019s facing considerable opposition to its plans to frack for shale gas in the United Kingdom. At the behest of its founder and chief shareholder, Jim Ratcliffe, a Brexit supporter who is among Britain\u2019s richest people, Ineos now owns Swiss and French soccer clubs and a British cycling team, and is financing a 2021 America\u2019s Cup sailing team.\n\nOf course, participants were covered in Nike logos from head to toe.\n\nBut it was never guaranteed that Mr. Kipchoge was going to succeed. In a similar attempt two years ago, staged by Nike on a Formula One racetrack in Italy, he came up just short. Two years later, the shoes are faster, the conditions were ideal and the runner himself was stronger.\n\nYou could tell from the reaction of his pacers, who were cheering despite running their own pacing 5Ks at a searing speed, that Mr. Kipchoge is widely liked and admired. That is partly because when he talks about running, he talks less about himself than about how his achievements fit into the context of \u201cthe world\u201d and \u201chumanity.\u201d The joy and inspiration of the moment are hard to take issue with.\n\nMr. Kipchoge has earned millions of dollars from his work but still trains with his teammates in the rural highlands of Kenya near where he grew up. On Saturday morning, for all the science thrown his way, he woke up and ate oatmeal for breakfast. Last year, in a profile by The Times, he said that one of his favorite books was \u201cThe Seven Habits of Highly Effective People\u201d and recommended that the reporter read it too.\n\nSoft-spoken and charismatic, he speaks in the style of a philosopher. After Saturday\u2019s marathon, when he was asked how he planned to celebrate, he replied, \u201cAs normal. I don\u2019t go haywire celebrating. I always celebrate in a human way, in a calm way.\u201d\n\nIn this marathon Mr. Kipchoge wasn\u2019t racing against anyone \u2014 and was running for everyone. In Kenya the event was huge. He received a call from the country\u2019s president, President Uhuru Kenyatta, the night before his run, and footage from his hometown, Eldoret, showed overjoyed crowds of thousands breaking into song as he closed in on the finish line. People around the world woke up at all hours to watch the race in real time, which started at 8:15 a.m. in Austria. There were thousands of people lining the park cheering him on in Vienna, something that rarely happens for distance running these days.\n\nSo what\u2019s next? It\u2019s not too soon to dream: Though it took a while, someone eventually climbed Everest without oxygen. It\u2019s also worth noting that there\u2019s currently no women\u2019s equivalent of \u201cbreaking two\u201d \u2014 we could put similar energy and investment into that. And someday, someone will break two hours without massive shoes or a team of 41 world-class runners. Mr. Kipchoge himself is the first to say so.\n\nOthers are already right behind him \u2014 Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia came within just two seconds of Mr. Kipchoge\u2019s world record last month. And the 2020 Olympics are less than a year away. We\u2019ve seen what he can do on his own. Now, let\u2019s watch them race.\n\nLindsay Crouse (@lindsaycrouse), an editor with Op-Docs, has a best marathon time of 2:57.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
