Stay warm\n\nEver get told \u2018You\u2019ll catch your death\u2019?\n\nYour nan was onto something.\n\nA Yale University study found the immune system doesn\u2019t work as well in chilly weather.\n\n\u2018Viruses don\u2019t like your body to be warm, so dressing for the cold may help ward them off before they take hold,\u2019 says nutritional therapist Alison Cullen on behalf of Avogel.\n\n2. Prioritise sleep\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\u2018While you\u2019re asleep, your body secretes hormones involved in fighting disease,\u2019 says GP and medical nutritionist Dr Sarah Brewer of Healthspan.\n\n\u2018People who sleep for 7-8 hours have better immunity than those who are sleep-deprived.\u2019\n\nIf you\u2019re low on zzzs, make up for it with an immune-boosting nap, says Alison.\n\n\u2018One study found just a 30-minute daytime nap was enough to counteract the effect of poor night-time sleep on stress and immune markers.\u2019\n\n3. Wear a scarf\n\n\u2018The moisture and hair inside your nose acts as a protective barrier and traps viruses so your immune defences can deal with them before they multiply,\u2019 says Dr Brewer.\n\n\u2018If your nose gets too cold or dry, this line of defence stops working properly.\n\n'It helps to wear a scarf around your nose, and use nasal spray to counteract drying central heating.\u2019\n\n4. Keep it clean\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nWhile you\u2019re right to back away from anyone hacking and coughing, you\u2019re more likely to pick up cold viruses from something you touch than the air you breathe.\n\n\u2018Cold viruses often lurk on surfaces, such as door knobs, as they\u2019re often touched after sneezing,\u2019 says Dr Brewer.\n\n\u2018Wash your hands regularly and carry hand sanitiser.\u2019\n\nNo way to clean your hands?\n\nAvoid touching your eyes or nose, says immunologist Dr Ross Walton.\n\n\u2018This is a very common route for viruses to get into your system.\u2019\n\n5. Exercise at the right level\n\n\u2018Moderate exercise keeps immune cells circulating and counters the sapping effects of stress, so resist the urge to hibernate,\u2019 says Alison.\n\n\u2018However, intense exercise increases demands on your body and suppresses immunity, leaving you more vulnerable to winter bugs.\u2019\n\nSo maybe this isn\u2019t the time to take up marathon training.\n\n6. Get the flu jab\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nColds are one thing, but flu is the winter illness to really avoid.\n\nLast year there was a fall in the flu jab uptake, particularly among the over-65s.\n\n\u2018Worryingly, this is the group least able to fight off the flu virus and most vulnerable to potentially life-threatening complications like pneumonia,\u2019 says Dr Walton.\n\nHe urges people not to be put off by \u2018fake news\u2019.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a myth having the flu jab can give you flu.\n\n\u2018At worst, you might feel a little below par for a few days as your immune system makes antibodies against the vaccine\u2019s weakened form of the virus.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s true the jab can\u2019t protect against all strains of flu, and its effectiveness varies from year to year.\n\n\u2018But getting vaccinated saves lives,\u2019 says Dr Walton.\n\n\u2018If you\u2019re offered it, have it. If you\u2019re not at-risk, you\u2019re still helping to reduce the spread of flu to those who are.\n\nI certainly have one every year.\u2019\n\nFact: You have a 95% chance of being infected if you encounter a new cold virus, but having a strong immune system gives you a chance of fighting it off before it actually makes you ill.\n\n7. Take supplements that could help\n\n- Echinacea\n\n\u2018This has perhaps the most complete evidence in terms of cold prevention,\u2019 says Dr Walton.\n\n\u2018A large study at The Institute Of Common Cold on preventative use of A.Vogel Echinaforce, \u00a34.99, over four months found a 59% reduction in recurrent colds, and a reduction in severity and duration of symptoms.\u2019\n\n- Probiotics\n\nOver 70% of your body\u2019s immune system is located in your gut, so the right balance of gut bacteria is critical for good immunity, says Solgar\u2019s Paul Chamberlain.\n\n\u2018Solgar\u2019s new Ultibio Immune, \u00a331.25, provides patented immune support shown to reduce the frequency of infections, and can be as part of a daily winter wellness regime.\u2019\n\n3. Multi-vitamins\n\n\u2018Diet comes first, but this guards against deficiencies in nutrients such as vitamins C and D, selenium and iron that can affect immunity,\u2019 says Dr Brewer.\n\n\u2018One study showed older people who took multivitamins for one year had half as many days ill with infections compared with those who didn\u2019t.\u2019\n\nTry Health-span Multi-Vitality Gold, \u00a35.95.\n\nIt's not just what you eat, but how\n\n1. Chew your food well\n\n\u2018Stomach acid destroys certain viruses, and chewing food well stimulates this important line of defence,\u2019 says Alison.\n\n\u2018Avoid drinking with meals, as liquids dilute stomach acid.\n\n'I see a lot of clients who suffer repeated infections linked to low stomach acid.\n\n'If you\u2019re on acid-suppressing medication, discuss with your GP to see if it\u2019s still necessary.\u2019\n\n2. Eat hot meals\n\nPeople assume \u2018healthy food\u2019 means raw salads, but it\u2019s a good idea to go for nutritious cooked meals this time of year, says Alison.\n\n\u2018When you eat cold food, your body spends energy warming it up, which means less energy to power the immune system.\u2019\n\n3. Immunity boosters\n\nDr Brewer\u2019s cold-proofing diet tips\n\n- Fruit\n\nFruit provides so many immune-boosting antioxidants with the greatest protection coming from pomegranates, prunes, plums, green peppers (a fruit!), berries, cherries, black grapes and apples.\n\n- Veg\n\nVeg with the highest levels of immune-boosting phytochemicals include purple-red cabbage, beetroot, kidney beans and aubergines.\n\nOnions and garlic contain chemicals that help protect against colds.\n\n- Oily fish\n\nSalmon, mackerel and sardines provide omega-3 fats, which help cells respond to immune signals and fight infections more quickly.\n\nIf you don\u2019t eat oily fish once a week, consider an omega-3 supplement.", "description": "Dreading the onset of winter sneezes, coughs and worse?
