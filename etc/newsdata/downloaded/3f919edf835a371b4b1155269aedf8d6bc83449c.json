GI generated revenue of \u00a32m and EBITDA of \u00a30.5m in its first three months and additional synergies have been identified. It is early days but in the context of a \u00a35.3m price tag (EV) we see this performance as encouraging. 1Spatial also highlighted significant contract wins post period end. It now looks well set to execute on its next phase: establishing a market leading position in Location Master Data Management (LMDM).\n\n1Spatial Revenue\n\nSolid performance in the core\n\nReported revenue of \u00a310.9m included \u00a38.9m from the core business, up 1% y-o-y. The Spatial Solutions segment (\u00a36.4m) grew 8% y-o-y, despite the shift to term licensing, with growth in all territories. Adjusted EBITDA in the core business rose by c 25% in line with management expectations to \u00a30.8m (9% margin). This was boosted by a \u00a30.4m adjustment for IFRS 16 and the \u00a30.5m contribution from GI (see below).\n\nPlus a good start from GI\n\nGI reported revenue of \u00a32m for its first three months. Given we had included \u00a34.9m for FY20 (ie nine months), it looks to be tracking ahead of expectations. It also reported adjusted EBITDA of \u00a30.5m (a 25% margin) and further (unspecified) revenue and cost synergies are expected to benefit the P&L in FY21.\n\nPositive outlook but estimates unchanged for now\n\n1Spatial highlights a record order book, increased revenue visibility and a number of significant contract wins post period end (see London geospatial pilot project win). We raise our FY20 adjusted EBITDA estimate to \u00a33.1m to reflect the impact of IFRS 16 (see over) but leave our underlying forecasts unchanged for now.\n\nValuation: Execution, margins and LMDM priced in?\n\nThe acquisition and integration of GI marks the successful completion of 1Spatial\u2019s turnaround strategy. The company is now focused on establishing a leadership position in LMDM. We will review 1Spatial\u2019s longer-term prospects in due course, but continue to believe that the current valuation (FY21 EV/sales of 1.3x) does not reflect the increasing evidence of execution, the potential for margin expansion or the chances of longer-term success in LMDM.\n\nShare price performance\n\nShare Price Performance\n\nBusiness description\n\n1Spatial\u2019s core technology validates, rectifies and enhances customers\u2019 geospatial data. The combination of its software and advisory services reduces the need for costly manual checking and correcting of data.\n\nChanges to forecasts\n\nAdding adjusted EBITDA in the core business to the contribution from GI, 1Spatial generated adjusted EBITDA in H1 of \u00a31.2m, a margin of 10.9% (before IFRS 16 adoption \u2013 see below). Our FY20 estimate (on the same basis) of \u00a32.1m implies the company needs to deliver just \u00a30.9m in H2. We leave our forecasts unchanged for now but as H2 will include an extra three months from GI (potentially an additional \u00a30.5m) they should be very achievable. The company prefers a cautious stance on numbers given the substantial near-term political risks in the UK and its experience in the US earlier this year, where the government shutdown unexpectedly affected performance.\n\nExhibit 1\n\nWhile we leave our underlying forecasts largely unchanged, the adoption of IFRS 16 from the beginning of the year does have a significant impact on the presentation of the P&L and, to a lesser extent, cash flow. IFRS 16 eliminates the distinction of leases as either operating leases or finance leases and has the effect of moving c \u00a31m of annual costs previously reported above the EBITDA line into depreciation (a small element is moved into finance costs).", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Edison  covering: 1Spatial PLC.
