Twenty-five Republicans joined most Democrats in voting for the bill, while five Democrats voted against it.\n\nThe vote comes after the House Financial Services Committee advanced the measure in June.\n\nUnder the bill, certain corporations and limited liability companies would be required to disclose their true owners to the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) at the time they are formed. They\u2019d also have to submit annual filings with FinCEN listing their current true owners and any changes to ownership. There would be penalties for people who intentionally submit fraudulent or incomplete information.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe disclosure requirements don\u2019t apply to companies that have more than 20 employees and $5 million in gross receipts because these companies are less likely to be anonymous shell companies.\n\nThe bill would also make major updates to the Bank Secrecy Act for the first time since 2001.\n\nSupporters of the bill argue that it would be helpful in combating money laundering, terror financing and tax evasion.\n\n\u201cIt will make our country safer,\u201d said Rep.
