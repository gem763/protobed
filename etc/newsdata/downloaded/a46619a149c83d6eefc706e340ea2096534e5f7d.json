Bill Weld says, \u201cCould I vote for a Democrat? Hell yes. If it\u2019s Trump against Joe Biden, I\u2019m with Biden in a heartbeat.\u201d\n\nWeld\u2019s comments came during an appearance at the CITIZEN by CNN conference. He was joined onstage by former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford and former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh. They are also seeking the Republican presidential nomination against Trump.\n\nWeld says he\u2019d never support Trump \u201cfor any office under any circumstances\u201d but could \u201cvery well\u201d support a third-party candidate.\n\nIf the matchup were Trump against Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Weld says, \u201cI suppose I\u2019d rather have her, with a couple of modifications in her platform.\u201d\n\nSanford and Walsh both said Warren is the toughest Democratic opponent for Trump at the moment.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s articulate and bright and quick,\u201d Sanford said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got the energy and the fire,\u201d Walsh said.\n\nWeld said Trump\u2019s strongest opponent is Biden because \u201che\u2019s a lunch-pail Democrat. He\u2019s a good guy. He\u2019s a centrist, and Trump is not going to be able to play the socialism card against him.\u201d", "description": "Former Massachusetts Gov.
