Strasburg gave up two runs in his stint; Verlander allowed four runs before Houston's bullpen let it become a rout.\n\nMemorably shut down for the 2012 playoffs to protect his surgically repaired right elbow, Strasburg has a lengthy history of health issues. That includes no fewer than a dozen trips to the injured list, with two per year in 2010, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\nBut not a single such stay in 2019, when he made 33 starts and led the NL with 209 innings in the regular season while going 18-6 with a 3.32 ERA and 251 strikeouts. Add in his postseason innings, and his full-year total is 237, 17 more than in 2014.\n\nHis pitch total of 3,839, including October, also is a career high, as are his 17 outings of at least 100 pitches each, going 105, 117 and 114 over his last three games.\n\n\"I think mechanically, I've been able to be a little bit more consistent when I go out there and pitch. Just made some minor tweaks in the offseason training program. I kind of put more emphasis on just strength, not so much endurance, and trying to get my weight up,\" said the 31-year-old Strasburg, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2009 amateur draft. \"And I was able to kind of ride that throughout the year.\"\n\nThis postseason, he's truly been at his best, frequently relying on more on a seemingly unhittable changeup or a right-where-he-wants it curveball as out pitches, rather than the high-90s mph fastball he thrived with in earlier times.\n\nStrasburg enters Tuesday with a 4-0 record, 1.82 ERA, 40 strikeouts and just two walks in five appearances, four as a starter.\n\nVerlander has not pitched up to the high standards he established while winning 225 games, collecting 2011 AL Cy Young and MVP honors and earning eight All-Star selections. After going 21-6 with a 2.58 ERA and 300 Ks during the regular season, this is what he's done in five postseason starts: 1-3, 4.15 ERA, 35 strikeouts, 11 walks.\n\nAnother stat he'd love to change Tuesday: Verlander is the only pitcher in major league history to have an 0-5 record in the World Series.\n\nFive days after losing to Washington, he'll get another shot at them.\n\n\"Once they've seen you three, four at-bats, it's a little bit easier for them to make adjustments,\" Verlander said. \"And having seen your off-speed stuff and tracked it, you just need to execute a little bit better.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
