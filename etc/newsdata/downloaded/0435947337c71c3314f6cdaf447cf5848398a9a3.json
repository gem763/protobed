According to Harley-Davidson, the LiveWire bike allows for three charging options, relying on either a compatible charging station or a household outlet + on-board charger The three charging options are: Level 1 (standard household outlet): 13 miles range per hour of charged.\n\n(standard household outlet): 13 miles range per hour of charged. Level 2 : LiveWire connected to a Level 2 charger, 13 miles / hour\n\n: LiveWire connected to a Level 2 charger, 13 miles / hour Level 3 (DC Fast Charge): 192 miles range per hour charged\n\nIt is powered by a 15.5 kWh battery and has a 105 horsepower magnetic engine and a range of 146 miles city driving on a single charge.\n\nHarley-Davidson had told potential customers to charge the bike only at registered dealers and not in their homes.\n\nThe bike was first shown in The Avengers: Age of Ultron as a sleek prototype ridden by Scarlett Johansson\u2019s Black Widow character.\n\nThe LiveWire promised a slew of advanced technical features, including what PR Manager Paul James descried as \u2018twist-and-go.\u2019\n\n\u2018Because it\u2019s all-electric, it\u2019s twist-and-go,\u2019 Paul James, PR Manager at Harley-Davidson, told Dailymail.com at the Las Vegas Convention Center earlier this year.\n\nThe LiveWire first appeared in The Avengers: Age of Ultron.\n\nThe LiveWire's battery is said to have a range of 146 miles of city driving.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s no transmission, there are no shifters, no clutch \u2013 it\u2019s very easy to ride.\u2019\n\nLiveWire is equipped with a full suite of electronic lateral aids, with a slew of sensors and programmable touch controls.\n\nIt also has cellular connectivity, making it the first mass market motorcycle in North America with the capability.\n\nThis means it can alert the owner if the bike has been tampered with or moved. It also has built-in GPS for location tracking.\n\nAs for the sound, Harley says its electric powertrain will produce a \u2018new signature Harley-Davidson sound,\u2019 with minimal vibration, heat, and noise.", "description": "Harley-Davidson's long anticipated electric motorcycle the LiveWire will be delayed a little longer after the company saw some unexpected findings during final quality check.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/19/19754390-0-image-a-17_1571163693186.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
