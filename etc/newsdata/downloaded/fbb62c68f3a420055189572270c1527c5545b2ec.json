Photo: Gary Gershoff/WireImage\n\nThis past summer, when Jezebel took notice of suspicious Instagram photos of Jessica Biel seemingly lobbying alongside a prominent anti-vaxxer, the actress unintentionally directed the country\u2019s attention toward a California bill that was infuriating anti-vaccination activists: SB 276, which pertains to the medical exemption process for immunizations. At the time, the bill was in its early stages, but last week, California governor Gavin Newsom signaled that he\u2019ll soon likely be signing it.\n\nWhat exactly will this bill accomplish, and why has it drawn the fury of anti-vaxxers? Below, everything to know about SB 276.\n\nWhat is the bill?\n\nEarlier this year, California senator Richard Pan, a practicing pediatrician who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, introduced Senate Bill 276, which seeks to combat fake medical exemptions.\n\nWait, first, what exactly are medical exemptions?\n\nIn short, medical exemptions allow people \u2014 typically, children \u2014 to abstain from being immunized due to a medical condition. Per the National Vaccine Information Center, medical exemptions should be \u201cvery difficult to obtain because almost all medical reasons for delaying or withholding vaccines have been eliminated by government and medical trade officials.\u201d\n\nExcept, under current California law, it hasn\u2019t been so difficult.\n\nWhy is that so?\n\nCurrently, in California, doctors have the authority to grant medical exemptions to vaccination \u2014 they don\u2019t have to get the approval of the state\u2019s Department of Public Health. And, according to Kaiser Health News, this has resulted in doctors liberally allowing patients to claim unnecessary medical exemptions to being immunized.\n\nThe proof: In the past two years, the number of children in California who have been granted a medical exemption has tripled, according to California Healthline, which has serious implications. Like many states across the country, California has been fighting measles outbreaks, which have flourished in undervaccinated communities; in 2019 so far, the state has seen 51 confirmed cases, according to the California Department of Public Health.\n\n(The reason the number of medical exemptions has gone up in the past few years is in part related to the passing of SB 277 in 2015. While that bill was restrictive on its face, as it got rid of California\u2019s personal beliefs exemption, the Los Angeles Times reports that the state saw an increase in the number of parents claiming medical exemptions, many of which public health officials suspected were fake.)\n\nSo SB 276 cracks down on illegitimate medical exemptions?\n\nYes, that\u2019s the goal. Under the bill, California\u2019s Department of Public Health will make the final decision regarding whether the underlying condition claimed in a doctor\u2019s medical exemption met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s guidelines. Per the Los Angeles Times, state health officials estimate that more than 40 percent of California\u2019s yearly 11,500 medical exemptions would be denied under the legislation.\n\nWhich is why anti-vaxxers are opposed it, right?\n\nAnti-vaxxers, many of whom have spoken out against the bill on social media, are vehemently opposed to it. The negative response to it has been so strong that Pan put out a \u201cfact versus myth\u201d sheet to combat disinformation.\n\nAnd Jessica Biel is among this group?\n\nYep. On June 12, Jezebel reported that Biel was spotted alongside Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former environmental activist who has pivoted toward spewing baseless anti-vax claims, at the California Assembly. Before the day was over, the Daily Beast had confirmed that Biel was vocally opposing SB 276.\n\nBiel, however, has pushed back on being labeled an anti-vaxxer; instead, she wrote in an Instagram post on June 13, her concern over SB 276 has to do with specifics regarding medical exemptions.\n\n\u201cMy dearest friends have a child with a medical condition that warrants an exemption from vaccinations, and should this bill pass, it would greatly affect their family\u2019s ability to care for their child in this state,\u201d she wrote in the caption. \u201cThat\u2019s why I spoke to legislators and argued against this bill.\u201d\n\nAgain, SB 276 would not revoke legitimate medical exemptions.\n\nAnd the governor is going to sign it?\n\nFollowing a tense week of negotiating with Pan over the scope of the bill, on September 6, California governor Gavin Newsom announced that he will sign SB 276 once lawmakers make changes to another proposed bill relating to medical exemptions, the Los Angeles Times reports. (Newsom\u2019s amendments to the latter bill, SB 714, would \u201cclarify legal and administrative processes in SB 276 in order to ensure medical providers, parents, school administrators and public health officials know the rules of the road once it takes effect,\u201d Newsom\u2019s spokesperson Nathan Click said in a statement. SB 714, which has been passed by the Legislature, requires approval by the Assembly and Senate by September 13.)\n\nIn response to the news that Newsom will sign SB 276, anti-vax protesters have reportedly swarmed the parking lot for state legislators, as well as the capitol, as a last-ditch effort to convince lawmakers against passing the measures. Pan, meanwhile, is celebrating the progress California has made, even though some of Newsom\u2019s amendments have weakened his original bill.\n\nAnti-vaccine protestors have formed human chains to block the parking lot for state legislators and an entrance to the Capitol this morning #sb276 pic.twitter.com/L9Zff2ZCEp \u2014 Liam Dillon (@dillonliam) September 9, 2019\n\n\u201cAs the latest measles outbreak threatens the country\u2019s elimination status, California acted to keep children safe at school by abolishing non-medical exemptions,\u201d Pan said in a statement. \u201cI appreciate the Governor\u2019s commitment to sign SB 276 with amendments contained in SB 714 that we both agree upon to ensure we maintain the community immunity needed to protect our kids.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
