The integration between Nymi and POMS means POMSnet users can now take advantage of the Nymi solution for authentication e-signing in POMSnet Manufacturing Execution System.\n\n\n\nThe partnership is a continuing effort by Nymi to address the very real challenge in the pharmaceutical market of ensuring secure compliance and data integrity whilst optimizing production efficiency. Nymi customers that use POMSnet\u00ae MES will be able to use their Nymi Bands to authenticate and e-signature authorizations, and POMS Corporation customers will be able to utilize Nymi to optimize efficiency in their manufacturing environments.\n\n\u201cWe see a huge efficiency gain for our customers. We\u2019ve found that on average, an electronic e-signature can take 10-15 seconds when it\u2019s done correctly and much longer if it\u2019s not done correctly. If you look at this from the perspective of hundreds of e-signatures a day, Nymi is going to be able to help our customers cut this time down and be more secure and productive at the same time,\u201d says Darrell Tanner, Director, Sales and Consulting Services at POMS.\n\nThis partnership with POMS was a natural fit, as Nymi currently works with the top 100 pharmaceutical manufacturers, while five of the world\u2019s 10 largest and 13 of the top 50 pharmaceutical companies in the Global Fortune 500 use POMS\u00ae MES.\n\n\"POMS has been a proactive and focused partner,\u201d said Andrew Foxcroft, Vice President at Nymi. \u201cTheir customers can expect to experience significant benefits out of this partnership. This includes delivery and rapid implementation to the integration of its core platform.\"\n\n\u201cWe want to get this technology out in front of our customers so they can start to recognize the benefits of this technology. It\u2019s not just about an e-signature; the validation process goes beyond that. The ability to scale this service will continue to bring efficiency and greater reliability and certainty to the process,\u201d said Patrick Nazzaro, General Manager at POMS.\n\nPOMS Corporation is committed to improving the effectiveness and competitiveness of regulated manufacturers by delivering proven, world-class manufacturing execution systems (MES) solutions that integrate seamlessly with other enterprise applications.
