Still, his performance set the tone for the rest of the roster, as Golden State finished 36.2 percent from the field.\n\nRookie Jordan Poole -- who came into Monday's game shooting 47 percent in the preseason -- made just 3 of his 17 shot attempts, while Eric Paschall finished 2-of-7.\n\nThe rookies were bound to have a bad game after their respective hot starts to the preseason. Like Curry, they have a chance for redemption Wednesday against the same Lakers team.\n\nGolden State still can't rebound\n\nFor much of the week, Warriors coach Steve Kerr lamented his team's poor rebounding effort. On Monday, Golden State did little to quell Kerr's concerns, as the team was outrebounded once again, 48-46.\n\nDwight Howard was a big reason for the Warriors' struggles, grabbing 12 of his game-high 13 rebounds in the first half. Los Angeles took a 35-24 rebound advantage into halftime.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith Kevon Looney and Willie Cauley Stein out, Golden State will have many nights like these. The key will be how effectively the Warriors' offense can counteract the problem.\n\nChriss continues to impress\n\nMarquese Chriss has been the surprise of camp, providing a badly-needed presence in the frontcourt. On Monday, he continued his solid play, finishing with 14 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nCurrently on a non-guaranteed deal, Chriss is proving he belongs on the regular-season roster. Due to his emergence, the Warriors find themselves in a conundrum heading into the final weekend of camp. With little cap space, the team will either have to cut a player to make room for Chriss, or make a trade to unload a salary off the books.\n\n[RELATED: Warriors' offseason gamble on Chriss appears it will pay off]\n\nEither way, it's becoming more and more likely Chriss will be on the Warriors' roster on Opening Night.\n\nWarriors takeaways: What we learned in 104-98 preseason loss to Lakers originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "The Warriors dropped another game to the Lakers in which both teams were significantly shorthanded.", "authors": ["Logan Murdock"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OEAnrlqCO4s68HC7NGdRXg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Oo.pQmy3AYZ4EK_Hf1TomA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/655fc013a5509ffb7dc61cb403ca9da3", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
