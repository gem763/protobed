If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nFor some people, healthy living\u2014exercising regularly, eating right, and sleeping well\u2014just comes naturally. If you have someone like that in your life, you're in luck: We've compiled a list of the best health and fitness products for you to bestow upon your favorite health nut or fitness fanatic.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're someone trying to become a little healthier, pass this list along to your loved ones to give yourself a boost as you set forward your new year's resolutions for 2020. These are the best gifts for health and fitness of 2019, according to Reviewed.\n\n1. For the one who wants to document daily activity: The best fitness tracker\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Fitbit Charge 3 (Photo: FitBit)\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, we all need a little reminder now and then to get up off the couch and get moving. The Fitbit Charge 3 can give you the extra boost of motivation your giftee needs, especially heading into the new year. Our favorite fitness tracker goes from the office to the gym to the pool\u2014it has sleek looks, a touchscreen that automatically adjusts to lighting conditions, a solid battery life of 7 days, and best of all, is waterproof. Plus, the smartphone notifications make this Fitbit a worthy lazy-day companion, too.\n\nGet the Fitbit Charge 3 on Amazon for $139.99\n\n2. For the runner who wants to track progress: A GPS running watch\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Garmin Forerunner 245 and Garmin Forerunner 645 (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser & Jackson Ruckar)\n\nIf your favorite runner is still using a phone to record runs (or\u2014gasp!\u2014nothing at all), wrap up a GPS running watch, which puts mileage, pace, and time stats on the wrist in real time and keeps a record of all miles run to allow improvement analysis. In our tests, the latest Garmin Forerunners proved to be the best out there.\n\nOur runners picked the sporty-look Forerunner 245 best of our test for its easy-to-use buttons, large readable screen, and feature-packed tracking. The version that stores music, including offline Spotify playlists, plays over any pair of Bluetooth headphones. The Forerunner 645 packs all the same features in a more sophisticated style that doesn't scream \"I'm a runner\"\u2014not that any runner you know wouldn't be working that into every conversation anyway.\n\n3. For the one who works out to music: Wireless headphones\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Powerbeats Pro and Mpow Flame Bluetooth Headphones (Photo: Beats & Mpow)\n\nFor the fitness fanatic doesn\u2019t have a gym buddy, the least you can do is offer a way to play \"Eye of the Tiger\" on repeat while working out. The Beats Powerbeats Pro are some of the best water-resistant headphones we've tested, with an earhook design that will stay put on anyone's ears even through tough workouts\u2014not to mention excellent battery life, sound quality, and no wires to worry about.\n\nIf you want a less spend-y option, the MPow Flame earbuds cost less than $20 online. And they're sweat-friendly: We found they could play music while submerged under water for 30 minutes. Though not truly wireless\u2014a cord connects them to each other\u2014they're an awesome pick that no one will guess have such a low price.\n\n4. For the yogi: The best mat money can buy\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Lululemon Reversible Yoga Mat (Photo: lululemon)\n\nAnyone with even an occasional yoga practice can appreciate our favorite yoga mat for its firm grip and cushioned feel under hand and foot (and knee). Whether your recipient will tote it to a strenuous heat yoga class or turn on some YouTube yoga in the living room, they're sure to find that the Lululemon mat performs beautifully.\n\nGet the Lululemon Reversible Mat 5mm at Lululemon for $68\n\n5. For the one whose muscles are always tight: An award-winning foam roller\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: LuxFit & TriggerPoint Foam Rollers (Photo: LuxFit & TriggerPoint)\n\nBeing active\u2014whatever your commitment\u2014can comes with muscle soreness. Instead of shelling out cash for a one-time massage, give our favorite foam roller for easing out those niggling aches. For those with limited space, consider the TriggerPoint GRID Foam Roller\u2014same outcome for their muscles, but easier to store.\n\n6. For the one who's never far from the phone: A stay-put waist belt\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: SPIbelt Performance Series Water-Resistant Running Belt (Photo: SPIbelt)\n\nFor those who exercise outside, there are benefits to bringing along a smartphone, whether to check directions, text a workout buddy en route, or make a call in case of emergency. The SPIbelt Performance Series Running Belt stretches to fit extra-large phones plus keys and is made of water-resistant material to keep contents from getting damp from unexpected bad weather and sweat. It's convenient for gym rats, where a phone left on the floor or bench is liable to get smashed.\n\nGet the SPIbelt Performance Series Water-Resistant Running Belt on Amazon for $25.99\n\n7. For the one who needs a good laugh to get through a workout: Silly socks\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Zensah running socks (Photo: Zensah)\n\nLet\u2019s be real, did the holidays even happen if you don\u2019t get a pair of socks from someone? Man or woman, old or young, everyone likes receiving a good novelty pair. Zensah makes these ones with fabrics that have anti-odor properties and that are designed specifically to be blister-proof, which is sweet, sweet music to any exerciser's ears. For the more serious type, there are some muted patterns, but honestly, who wouldn\u2019t want a pair of socks with donuts all over them?\n\nGet the Zensah Mini-Crew Sports Socks on Amazon for $19.99\n\n8. For the one who lives at the gym: A carryall bag and a secure lock\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Adidas Defender III Duffel Bag & Desired Tools 4 Digit Combination Padlock (Photo: Adidas & Desired Tools)\n\nKeeping workout gear together, yet separating the dirty and sweaty from the clean and dry, is an eternal struggle. Luckily, the Adidas Defender duffel bag has plenty of pockets, smartly designed for segregation\u2014with some made of mesh for ventilation, so sweat-soaked clothes can breathe. And just to make sure the bag and its contents are still there at the end of a workout, a sturdy padlock with a programmable combo is the ideal compliment to this gift.\n\n9. For the one who exercises at home: A tool that turns the body into the weight\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: TRX Go Suspension Trainer (Photo: TRX)\n\nIf you've ever tried those funky-looking handled straps at the gym, you know they're a lot more intense than their flaccid, dangling state would indicate. The TRX Suspension Trainer is the OG in this category for good reason: The foam-covered handles are comfy to grip, the straps are safety-tested to hold 350 pounds of weight, and it's easy to install from any sturdy fixed point in a home or yard. And it's fun to use, if surprisingly challenging, for a device designed to strength-train using only body weight.\n\nGet the TRX Go suspension trainer on Amazon for $119.95\n\n10. For the one who strength-trains: 100 pounds of space-saving weights\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Core Fitness Adjustable Dumbbells (Photo: Core Fitness)\n\nWhen it comes to building muscle, there's only so much to gain with small lightweight dumbbells (that is, not much), but investing in a full set of weights is costly and takes up a ton of room. The Core Fitness adjustable dumbbells replace a whole gym, adjusting from 5 to 50 pounds each with the flick of the wrist, and require a tiny fraction of the floor space.\n\nGet the Core Fitness adjustable dumbbells on Amazon for $277\n\n11. For the one who has limited time and space: A high-quality jump rope\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Survival and Cross jump rope (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nIf your loved one never seems to have time to hit the gym yet wants an easy way to fit in some cardio, look to a high-speed jump rope. Designed for the boxing gym, the adjustable rope allows for people of any size and shape to tailor the length to their needs. Yes, a jump rope finally long enough for people over six feet tall\u2014and a great gift for $10. You\u2019re welcome.\n\nGet the Survival and Cross Jump Rope on Amazon for $10\n\n12. For the one who's a studio-fitness fiend: A try-it-all membership\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Classpass membership (Photo: Classpass)\n\nThis gift is for the person with whom it takes two weeks to finalize plans because you have to work around his or her workout class schedule. With ClassPass, members can sign up for sessions at any studio that participates, without having to be a paid member of that gym. It\u2019s basically a pu-pu platter for fitness classes.\n\nIf you know of a specific studio where your giftee likes to take classes, you can always grab a gift card there instead. Some popular nationwide studios include SoulCycle, Orangetheory, and Pure Barre.\n\nGet a ClassPass gift card at ClassPass in any amount\n\n13. For the one who needs a reminder to stay hydrated: An awesome water bottle\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Hydro Flask water bottle (Photo: Hydro Flask)\n\nWhen it comes to health, hydration is key. You can do spin classes and lift weights galore, but if you aren\u2019t getting the proper amount of water each day, your body isn\u2019t operating at its peak performance. This is where our favorite water bottle, the Hydro Flask, comes in.\n\nIn multiple shapes and sizes, the Hydro Flask is perfect for anyone on your shopping list who drinks water. It keeps cold drinks cold for 24 hours and hot drinks hot for 12 hours, but most importantly, it will fit in the car's cupholders.\n\nGet the Hydro Flask Water Bottle on Amazon for $29.95\n\n14. For the smoothie lover: A seriously powerful personal blender\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Ninja Fit Personal Blender (Photo: Reviewed.com/Jackson Ruckar/Ninja)\n\nGetting healthy is the marriage of two activities, exercising and eating right (we know, we wish it was possible from just sitting on the couch, too). However, nothing makes eating right more fun than making smoothies. They're like milkshakes in disguise (go with it), filled with fruits and veggies instead of ice cream.\n\nOur favorite personal blender, the Ninja Fit, whips up a liquid breakfast or a post-workout treat in seconds, and with the perfect recipe, your giftee will start salivating just from hearing the whirring sound of the blades.\n\nGet the Ninja Fit personal blender on Amazon for $49.99\n\n15. For the one who takes powdered drinks to go: A new shaker bottle\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Blender Bottle (Photo: Blender Bottle)\n\nIf you're shopping for someone obsessed with protein shakes, your recipient already has at least one (or more) Blender Bottles\u2014which isn't to say an addition to the collection won't be appreciated. But a person doesn\u2019t need to have a gigantic container of whey powder sitting on top of the fridge to be the proud owner of a Blender Bottle. These wide-mouthed shakers are also a great buy for those who like to take their smoothies on the road or for runners who like the convenience of powdered electrolyte recovery drinks but don't enjoy sipping down clumps of undissolved powder. Regardless of their drink of choice, this is sure to be a hit with folks who are on the go before or after a workout.\n\nGet the Blender Bottle on Amazon for $12.99\n\n16. For the one who wants to eat better but not realize it: An air fryer\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Philips Airfryer XXL (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nWe all know that a diet heavy in fried food isn't so nutritionally sound. But it sure is yummy! For the ones on your list who wants to have their fried chicken and eat it, too, you must get them an air fryer. The Philips Airfryer XXL surprised even our cooking experts with the crispy fries and, yes, delectable \"fried\" chicken it produced, all with with up to 90% less fat than their oil-drenched cousins, according to the company's research.\n\nGet the Philips Airfryer XXL on Amazon for $199.95\n\n17. For the one who likes make-ahead meals: The best pressure cooker\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Instant Pot Ultra 10-in-1 (6 Quart) (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser)\n\nA sure-fire way of adopting better eating habits is to cook your own food\u2014and doing it in the fastest, simplest way, so the process becomes routine. The Instant Pot UItra ticks those boxes, besting all other pressure cookers on our tests. It whips up delicious one-pot meals, perfect for eating right away and freezing into portions for later. For a budget-friendlier option, the Instant Pot Duo 6 Qt 7-in-1 Pressure Cooker is a great choice, too, lacking some of the customization of the Ultra but none of the joy of (large-batch) cooking.\n\nGet the Instant Pot Ultra 10-in-1 (6 Quart) on Amazon for $108.93\n\n18. For the one who'd like to eat more veggies: An easy-to-use spiralizer\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Veggetti Spiralizer (Photo: Reviewed)\n\nEven for those who enjoy the taste of fresh vegetables, they can be kind of boring\u2014chop, steam, eat, repeat. That's why we're sure this inexpensive kitchen gadget, which easily turns zucchini, squash, carrots, or other dense produce into noodle-like ribbons, will be a hit with your healthy-eating giftee. And you know you'll be getting a good value: In our spiralizer test, the Veggetti bested units costing four times as much.\n\nGet the Ontel Veggetti Spiralizer on Amazon for $9.99\n\n19. For the one who has food-prep aspirations: A great kitchen scale and food storage set\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Pyrex Ultimate foot storage set & My Weigh KD-8000 kitchen scale (Photo: Pyrex & Reviewed)\n\nWith all that made-ahead food, a great set of storage containers is only logical. The Pyrex Ultimate set topped our test, keeping food fresh while also being both oven- and microwave-safe for speedy reheating.\n\nSome people get serious about food prep, when a weight goal (either a loss of fat or gain of muscle) is top of mind. For those folks, our top-pick digital kitchen scale blew away the rest with the attribute that matters most: accuracy.\n\n20. For the one who knows you shouldn't neglect your teeth: The best electric toothbrush\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Oral-B Pro 3000 (Photo: Oral-B)\n\nA regular manual toothbrush does the job, but most dentists agree that an electric toothbrush is more effective at clearing plaque (and not receding gums from too much pressure). If someone you know has been resisting spending the dough, give the Oral-B Pro 3000, our test-topping electric toothbrush.\n\nGet the Oral-B Pro 3000 on Amazon for $79.90\n\n21. For the one needing to breathe easy: A home air purifier\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Winix 5500 2 Air Purifier (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser)\n\nWe know \"home air purification\" is not exactly synonymous with \"most-wanted present\" but hear us out. The Winix 5500-2 Air Purifier impressed our testers with its ability to notably reduce the smell of cigarette smoke, musty mildew, and cooking odors in the air. It's also intuitive to use and includes thoughtful features such as a sleep mode, a timer, and a light sensor that automatically adjusts the back-lighting on the control panel. If peace of mind that your loved ones are breathing cleaner air isn't a gift in itself, we don't know what is.\n\nGet the Winix 5500-2 Air Purifier on Amazon starting at $143.88\n\n22. For the one who likes that all-tucked-in feeling: A cozy weighted blanket\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: The Gravity Blanket (Photo: Reviewed / Camryn Rabideau)\n\nIf your loved one's idea of a comfy night's sleep involves a huge pile of covers, this is the gift to give. (After all, they don't call it a \"comforter\" for no reason!) Weighted blankets are all the rage, and while their anxiety-quelling properties are up for debate, some people simply enjoy the feeling and may find it more conducive to a restful sleep. And the luxurious Gravity Blanket, with its washable, velvety cover and quality construction, is the must-buy investment for those folks.\n\nGet the Gravity Blanket on Gravity Blanket for $249 and up\n\n23. For the one who wakes up a lot: A sound machine and sleep mask\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Sound + Sleep by Adaptive Sound & Nidra Deep Rest sleep mask (Photo: Adaptive Sound & Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nSome of us sleep like rocks no matter our environment. For others, the mere hint of a sound or slit of light, and they're wide awake (and irritable). The second crew can benefits from the best sound machine we've tested\u2014with its 30 relaxing settings that completely blocked competing sounds in our tests\u2014and our favorite sleep mask, which our reviewer described as \"personal blackout curtains for your eyes... that won't fall off in the middle of the night.\" You're welcome.\n\n24. For the one whose muscles crave TLC: A take-anywhere massage pillow\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Zyllion Shiatsu Pillow Massager (Photo: Zyllion)\n\nThe next time your loved one calls you in to the next room, only to ask you to morph into a Swedish masseuse, be prepared: Hand over this incredibly relaxing pillow massager, which can be placed in a chair or under the neck for deep-tissue kneading\u2014without giving you sore muscles in the process.\n\nGet the Zyllion Shiatsu Pillow Massager with Heat on Amazon for $44.95\n\n25. For the one who always has sore feet: A soothing spa bath\n\nBest health and fitness gifts 2019: Ivation Foot Spa Massager (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser / Ivation)\n\nRemember that foot bath that seemed like a thoughtful gift but ended up in the back of the closet? This is not that foot spa. Once your recipient slips his or her tootsies into the warm, churning waters of the Ivation Foot Spa\u2014the overall best of the 14 we tested\u2014we're confident it will be enjoyed on the regular for soothing soreness, as well as pedicure prep.\n\nGet the Ivation Foot Spa on Amazon for $79.99\n\nPrices are accurate at the time of publication, but may change over time.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered this holiday season.
