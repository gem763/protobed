The latter is congruent with the bursting tech bubble, an event that lopped 50% off of the S&P 500.\n\nBelow, you can see that Hussman's margin-adjusted, price-to-earnings valuation measure is towering near record highs.\n\nHussman\n\nBut that's just the appetizer.\n\nTo Hussman, an overvalued market isn't enough to warrant a crash. He needs to see internals diverging as well \u2014 and it just so happens that's exactly the case. Back in February, his view of internals shifted negative.\n\n\"I believe that the combination of hypervaluation and unfavorable market internals has opened a trap door that is permissive of abrupt and severe market losses,\" Hussman said.\n\nThe following chart depicts his proprietary S&P 500 return when market returns are across-the-board favorable against the benchmark's actual total return.\n\nHussman\n\nThe stage is now set for what Hussman sees as a market that's getting ready to go nowhere.\n\nA market that goes nowhere\n\n\"The current risk of yet another long, interesting trip to nowhere is easy to understand when one examines the underlying drivers of long-term stock market returns: 1) long-term growth in representative fundamentals; 2) changes in valuations (the ratio of market prices to those representative fundamentals); and 3) dividends received in the interim,\" Hussman said.\n\nLet's break that down.\n\nThere's no denying growth in the US is slowing down. In the second quarter of 2019, gross domestic product grew at 2%, a full 1.1% below it's first-quarter reading.\n\nStructurally, Hussman has US economic growth pegged at just 1.4%. This metric reflects demographic labor force growth and trend productivity growth, barring forces of cyclical changes in unemployment.\n\nBelow, real structural growth is depicted by the red line, and is accompanied by the cyclical unemployment change to 8-year real GDP growth (green line) and the real US GDP growth 8-year average annual rate (blue line).\n\nHussman\n\nAs you would imagine, slowing growth puts downward pressure on corporate margins. And although S&P 500 profits are teetering near record highs, Hussman wants investors to take heed: declines in margins often lag hiccups in economy-wide profits amidst nonfinancial companies.\n\nThe graph below conveys this stark divergence.\n\nHussman\n\nThese factors \u2014 along with assuming a 2% S&P 500 dividend yield \u2014 rounds out Hussman's criteria for understanding how stocks take a trip to nowhere: growth, valuations, and expected dividends.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, it's time to do some math.\n\n\"The most reliable valuation measures we've identified across history are presently an average of 2.7 times their historical norms,\" he said. Assuming 4% nominal growth in fundamentals, and a future valuation multiple that simply touches its historical norm fully 20 years from today, the resulting average annual capital gain for the S&P 500 would be: (1.04)*(1/2.7)^(1/20)-1 = -1.0%.\"\n\nAdd in a 2% dividend yield, and we arrive at a 1% return over the next 20 years. A figure that will probably underperform T-bills.\n\n\"That's exactly how investors can get these very long interesting trips to nowhere,\" he concluded.\n\nHussman's track record\n\nFor the uninitiated, Hussman has repeatedly made headlines by predicting a stock-market decline exceeding 60% and forecasting a full decade of negative equity returns. And as the stock market has continued to grind mostly higher, he's persisted with his calls, undeterred.\n\nBut before you dismiss Hussman as a wonky perma-bear, consider his track record, which he breaks down in his latest blog post. Here are the arguments he lays out:\n\nPredicted in March 2000 that tech stocks would plunge 83%, then the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index lost an \"improbably precise\" 83% during a period from 2000 to 2002\n\nPredicted in 2000 that the S&P 500 would likely see negative total returns over the following decade, which it did\n\nPredicted in April 2007 that the S&P 500 could lose 40%, then it lost 55% in the subsequent collapse from 2007 to 2009\n\nIn the end, the more evidence Hussman unearths around the stock market's unsustainable conditions, the more worried investors should get. Sure, there may still be returns to be realized in this market cycle, but at what point does the mounting risk of a crash become too unbearable?", "description": "John Hussman explains the math behind his call for almost nonexistent stock returns over the next 20 years.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d72b0e22e22af3c2335e2f7-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
