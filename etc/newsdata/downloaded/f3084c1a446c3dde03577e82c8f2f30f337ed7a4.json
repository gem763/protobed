It\u2019s disgusting and you should be shamed of yourself.\n\n\u2018I Googled it afterwards and on Urban Dictionary and have attached a screenshot.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s hard enough to raise good Christian children in the USA in 2019 and keep them away from this filth without people like you subconsciously brainwashing them.\n\n\u2018Why would [you] use a word that implies fellatio after sodomy?\u2019\n\nSimon used the message as an opportunity to advertise his \u00a34.99 book by sharing it on his Facebook page Men Behaving Dadly.\n\nThousands of people clicked through to the Amazon listing and his work is now sitting as the site\u2019s number one best selling children\u2019s book on potty training.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimon, from Southend-on-sea, Essex, told Marjorie the sexual definition of \u2018fudgie\u2019 was not what he meant.\n\nSimon was told he \u2018should be ashamed of himself\u2019, but he \u2018couldn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass\u2019 (Picture: Kennedy News and Media) \u2018I\u2019m very passionate about vaccinations and autism awareness and I\u2019m used to getting abuse and dealing with vitriol and bile online \u2013 it\u2019s an occupational hazard.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a massive believer in taking nasty experiences and turning it into something positive, when I read the angry message I just laughed at it.\u2019\n\n\u2018Marjorie is from the US, possibly from the Bible Belt, and was angry because she was convinced that \u201cfudgie\u201d was referring to a disgusting sex act, which it isn\u2019t.\n\n\u2018People are now actually buying it off the back of her comment, it\u2019s a nice feeling to know the book is now an Amazon bestseller.\u2019\n\nSimon, who is also dad to Emma, three, and 19-month-old James, came up with the idea for the book to help his son Luke master the potty.\n\nHe decided to share Marjorie\u2019s complaint as a way to promote his new book (Picture: Kennedy News and Media) Children on the autistic spectrum commonly have difficulties and take longer training to use one.\n\nSimon said: \u2018We went to a supermarket and were looking at potty training books but I couldn\u2019t see any with an animal.\n\n\u2018I was spitballing all these potential words for poo and was thinking of rhymes like \u201cdog on the bog\u201d but when I said \u201clittle budgie and a fudgie\u201d he laughed a lot so I turned it into a poem, which he really loved.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe then went on to turn it into a book in January last year and he, along with music teacher wife Rachael Harris, 34, also taught daughter Emma with it.\n\nMarjorie\u2019s complaint was prompted after the proud dad shared a picture of Emma holding the book with a beaming smile on her face on Sunday afternoon.\n\nHis release ended up soaring to the top of the bestseller list for children\u2019s potty training books (Picture: Amazon) Simon said: \u2018The bit about it being \u201chard to raise good Christian children\u201d made me laugh.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not against any religion, but how on earth has your teenager heard of this word?\u2019\n\nMessaging Marjorie back, he said: \u2018I shared your concerns with my Facebook audience, and my book ended up going to the top of the Amazon bestseller chart overnight.\n\n\u2018Therefore, to use a phrase that is popular on your side of The Atlantic, I could not give \u201ca rat\u2019s ass\u201d.\u2019\n\nAmazon has been contacted for comment.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
