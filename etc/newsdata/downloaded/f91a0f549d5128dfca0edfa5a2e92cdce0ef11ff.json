MORE progressive economic policies are facing increased scrutiny as she improves in the polls. Curiously, her tough talk on free trade has led to comparisons with Donald Trump. Like Trump, Warren\u2019s critics label her a \u201cpopulist\u201d whose policies will increase trade barriers and leave the U.S. economy worse off.\n\nIn fact, Warren and Trump share only a small piece of ground. They are both frustrated with decades of U.S. trade policy. They both argue that free trade fails to serve America\u2019s interests and that average workers are being left behind.\n\nThat\u2019s where the similarities end.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen it comes to economic policies, Trump is a dyed-in-the-wool deregulator. Trade is no exception. Trump argues that America\u2019s trade deals contain unfair, burdensome rules that infringe on U.S. sovereignty. His solution is to loosen trade deals. He tried to remove key dispute provisions during recent NAFTA renegotiations, and he threatened to leave the World Trade Organization because the U.S. so often winds up on the wrong side of trade disputes.\n\nWhile Trump argues that trade deals do too much, Warren thinks they do too little.\n\nTo her, trade agreements fail to fulfill their promise. Trade agreements are supposed to do more than just trade promotion. They are also about setting standards across a wide variety of trade-related issues, including labor rights and environmental protections. In Warren\u2019s view, efforts to improve working conditions and environmental standards have been futile.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to argue with her. Starting with NAFTA, all of America\u2019s trade deals have included provisions relating to labor and the environment. Interest groups lobbied hard for these regulations. The purpose of these provisions is to help ensure that trade gains don\u2019t come at the expense of worker welfare or sustainability.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s very little evidence that these rules make a difference. Organized labor groups, human rights organizations and environmental watchdogs all claim that trade makes things worse. Not better.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe poor performance of past trade deals is exactly why Warren wants countries to meet stricter standards up front, before a trade agreement negotiation can even take place.\n\nThese standards include basic compliance with international labor organization guidelines, respect for fundamental human rights, efforts to prevent human trafficking and ending fossil fuel subsidies.\n\nJust reading that list, it\u2019s hard to imagine why it\u2019s controversial. Set trade aside for a moment. Each element of Warren\u2019s eligibility list is something countries should be doing anyway. So, what\u2019s the problem?\n\nWarren faces criticism partly because she departs from the previous orthodoxy. The traditional story goes like this: Liberalize trade first and positive political changes will follow. Once an economy starts to enjoy the wealth created by trade, there will be increasing demand for regulatory reforms. Workers will start asking for more rights and liberties to accompany their thicker wallets. There should also be louder calls for environmental sustainability.\n\nThat story sounds good on paper, but history reveals that it\u2019s largely a fairytale. Free markets can\u2019t be relied on to induce meaningful political change.\n\nWarren recognizes this problem. She wants countries to meet some basic standards before realizing the gains from trade. Those gains \u2013 which no one denies can be substantial \u2013 should be the reward for making positive reforms. Only then will governments be incentivized to improve working conditions or environmental protections.\n\nThat\u2019s doesn\u2019t sound much like Trumpian populism. Instead, it sounds an awful lot like simple pragmatism. Reform first. Get the reward later.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the core difference between Warren and Trump. The White House continues to champion deregulation and the virtues of free markets. Warren understands that the interests of the market don\u2019t overlap with the interests of workers or the environment. That\u2019s why we need rules.\n\nOf course, there are those who remain concerned that Warren\u2019s policies will limit opportunities to open new trade routes. That\u2019s true. Warren admitted that the U.S. fails to meet her own tough standards. Fine. If we want more open trade then we should start with making meaningful policy changes at home. Maybe then there wouldn\u2019t be a \u201cpopulist backlash\u201d against globalism in the first place.\n\nJeffrey Kucik is an associate professor in the School of Government and Public Policy at the University of Arizona.", "description": "Warren understands that the interests of the market don\u2019t overlap with the interests of workers or the environment.
