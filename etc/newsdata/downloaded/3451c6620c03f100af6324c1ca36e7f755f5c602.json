The Met Office added that power cuts and flooding of some homes and businesses are both 'likely'.\n\nThe storm front from Lorenzo arrived in the South West this morning amid concern it could bring traffic delays and power cuts, having passed west of Ireland yesterday and close to the Azores earlier in the week.\n\nMet Office meteorologist Bonnie Diamond said: 'Quite a windy day in south Wales and south-west England as the remnants of Storm Lorenzo move south-eastwards from Ireland, though by this stage a weak feature.\n\n'Some rain and drizzle will accompany the wind in these parts, though it'll turn drier later in the day. It'll be brightest with some sunshine in northern Scotland, particularly the Northern Isles.'\n\nStorm conditions feature in the South West and South Wales this morning (left), while it will also rain this afternoon (right)\n\nTemperatures tomorrow (left) and on Sunday (right) will get up to 16C (61F) in southern England and Wales\n\nFor the rest of England and Wales, Friday's outlook is fairly autumnal, with some clouds and outbreaks of rain, alongside some sunny spells at times.\n\nThe Environment Agency has imposed 21 flood alerts and five alerts across England - mostly in the Midlands and North West - although this is a significant reduction from earlier in the week when there were more than 250.\n\nThe RNLI feared many people will be lining quaysides and clifftops to take selfies and film clips on their phones with huge waves as a backdrop, and warned of the risk of death if people are swept into the sea in the process.\n\nOfficials are urging people to stay well away from the edges of cliffs, piers, harbour walls and promenades.\n\nA man watches the waves along the seafront at Lahinch in County Clare on the west coast of Ireland this morning\n\nKite surfers near Sandbanks in Dorset make the most of the gusty conditions in parts of Britain today\n\nSurfers near Bournemouth Pier in Dorset today make the most of the strong waves amid the windy conditions\n\nPhotographers take pictures are huge waves crash against the harbour wall at Porthcawl in South Wales this morning\n\nA woman struggles with her coat along the seafront at Lahinch in County Clare in the Republic of Ireland this morning\n\nWaves crash into Porthcawl in South Wales today, which is where the wettest and windiest weather will be seen in Britain\n\nTwo women and a man walk along a soaked pavement in Leeds last night as the city is hit by heavy downpours\n\nPeople take cover in Leeds last night as the West Yorkshire city faces heavy rain amid miserable conditions\n\nThe charity tweeted: 'If you are heading to the coast please take care around exposed areas as big waves can quickly sweep you off your feet! See someone in trouble? Dial 999 or 112 and ask for the Coastguard.'\n\nMet Office rain warning RAIN -- Sunday, October 6 -- Midnight to 6pm Heavy rain may cause some transport disruption and flooding in places on Sunday. What to expect: Spray and flooding on roads probably making journey times longer\n\nBus and train services probably affected with journey times taking longer\n\nFlooding of a few homes and businesses is likely\n\nSome interruption to power supplies and other services likely Heavy rain is expected across parts of Scotland during Saturday night before extending to northern and eastern England during Sunday. Within the warning area many parts will see 15-30 mm of rain during Sunday with the potential for as much as 40-50 mm in places, much of this falling in a 6 hour period. At this stage, there is still some uncertainty regarding the location of where the heaviest rain will occur.\n\nSteve Instance, RNLI community safety manager for the South West England, said: 'We're expecting more strong winds to hit throughout Friday, bringing with it rough sea conditions.\n\n'Those heading to the coast to take photographs of the conditions should make sure that they don't get too close. Strong winds and heavy rain will make the cliff paths treacherous and extra care should be taken when coastal walking.\n\n'We would advise people to stay out of the water. The four beaches across the south-west that have a lifeguard service on Friday are likely to be showing the red flag and these conditions will extend to almost all beaches along both north and south coasts.'\n\nMr Instance added: 'We are fortunate that we no longer have the large tides which brought with them all the flooding issues last week, but there will still be large surges associated with the big swell.'\n\nDuring similar conditions last Friday, RNLI lifeguards rescued four surfers from the water at St Agnes beach in Cornwall. Shortly before the incident, RNLI lifeguards on duty had made the decision to fly the red flag due to the large surf and strong onshore winds.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, nearly 20,000 homes lost power although 12,000 had it restored overnight. Wind gusts of up to 60mph were recorded in the country, but there was no impact on flights at Dublin Airport.\n\nThe Irish Coast Guard appealed to the public to exercise caution during Storm Lorenzo and not attempt to take photographs near coastal areas in case they are exposed to sudden waves or high winds.", "description": "The wettest and windiest weather today will be in South West England and South Wales, before showers fall across the country over the weekend - with the heaviest rain expected on Sunday.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/12/19295254-0-image-a-37_1570189656449.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
