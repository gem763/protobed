However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nFall is my favorite season without a doubt. Crisp weather, comfy sweaters, work commutes that don't leave me dripping in sweat... it feels amazing. But with the dropping temperatures comes a rise in colds and the flu. It's a small price to pay to enjoy such a delightful season, but that doesn't mean you have to suffer every time you start to get the sniffles.\n\nIn addition to whatever medicine or home remedy you prefer, there are plenty of things out there that are amazing to have when you're under the weather. You'd be surprised how much better you feel when you're laid up under one of the best comforters, breathing in warm, humid air from the top humidifier money can buy.\n\nTo help you make the most of your sick days, I put together a list of 15 top-quality products that can speed your recovery, or at least make it as comfortable as possible. Virtually all of the items in this list have been rigorously tested by our experts and outperformed their competitors, so if you do see something you want, you can be sure it'll work as advertised.\n\n1. An electric kettle so you can drink endless tea\n\nThe keep warm setting ensures you can have tea exactly when you need it. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nTea is a 100% must-have when you're sick. And an electric kettle makes it even easier to brew cup after cup. Cuisinart makes the best kettle we've ever tested. Not only can you choose the perfect temperature for the type of tea you're making, but it beeps when it's ready and stay warm in case you fall asleep before you can pour a cup. An electric kettle is also great to pre-heat water for instant soup or pasta or a hot water bottle.\n\nGet the Cuisinart PerfecTemp Electric Kettle on Amazon for $70. 99\n\n2. A humidifier to help you breathe better\n\nEase your sneeze with a warm mist humidifier so your throat and nose don't get too dry. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nOne of my least favorite parts of having a cold is the cough that can linger for weeks. To combat this, I crank my humidifier into high gear. You can use it all day if you want, but I usually just run mine at night. I also use it every night during the dry winter months because I\u2019m convinced it helps me feel better (I have zero idea if this is the case, but I also didn\u2019t get sick at all last winter so I\u2019m going to keep doing it).\n\nIf you don\u2019t have one already, the best humidifier we\u2019ve ever tested is a good choice, especially because it gives off a warm mist that\u2019s sure to be a comfort when you\u2019re stuck in bed with a cold.\n\nGet the Vicks on Amazon for $38.55\n\n3. A comforter because you\u2019re going to spend a lot of time in bed\n\nYou're going to spend a lot of time in bed. Might as well be comfy. (Photo: Reviewed / Camryn Rabideau)\n\nWhen you get a cold, the best \"medicine\" is lots of rest. If you're going to spend that much time in bed, it helps to have a comfy blanket to snuggle under. We recently tried out all the most popular, and found that this affordable opton from LinenSpa is one of the best comforters that won't break the bank.\n\nGet the LinenSpa All-Season Down Alternative Comforter on Amazon for $29.99\n\n4. A mask so you can rest during the day\n\nNaps are key to getting better faster, and this sleep mask can help. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nUnless you accidentally took too much DayQuil, or you still enjoy the sleeping habits of a teenager, resting during the day can be a struggle. Your body isn\u2019t used to it, there\u2019s more noise, the sun\u2019s out...but when you\u2019re sick, sleep is a must.\n\nInstead of relying on medicine to make you groggy enough to get some shut-eye (or in addition to), reach for one of the best sleep masks. Blocking out light will help you convince/trick your body that it\u2019s time to sleep.\n\nWe named this sleep mask our absolute favorite because it stays put all night and the formed cup shape creates some space so your eyes aren\u2019t smooshed in fabric. And these earplugs? Well, they are not only superb at blocking out sound, but they\u2019re comfortable and super cheap too.\n\nGet the Nidra Deep Rest Eye Mask on Amazon for $10.95\n\n5. Earplugs to give you peace and quiet\n\nEnsure you'll stay asleep for the duration of your nap with sound-blocking ear plugs. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nJust as bright light can keep you from getting that much needed shut-eye, loud sounds are just as distracting. Whether your kids are running around the house and, you know, being kids, or you live on a busy street or the neighbor is remodeling their kitchen (for the 50th time, Karen!), it\u2019s good to have earplugs handy. These are the best pair of ear plugs we've tried. They block out sound, they're comfortable, and you can get a few or a ton for cheap.\n\nGet the Hearos Xtreme Ear Plug Single Pack (14 Pairs) on Amazon for $9.99\n\n6. A water bottle with a straw to stay hydrated\n\nNo need to lift your head off the pillow when your water bottle has a straw. (Photo: CamelBak)\n\nWhen you\u2019re sick, lifting your hand to sip some water can be exhausting. But you really need to hydrate so you can get better faster. A water bottle, especially one with a straw, is handy because you can leave it in the bed with you all day.\n\nWhen we tested all the best water bottles, we loved that this one came with a straw for easier sipping. It also hold 25 ounces of water, which means less trips to refill it. For under $15, it\u2019s definitely a purchase you won\u2019t regret, whether you have a cold or you\u2019re healthy as ever.\n\nGet the CamelBak Eddy 25-oz. Water Bottle on Amazon for $14.99\n\n7. More tissues than you think you\u2019ll need\n\nAlways have more tissues on hand that you think you'll need. (Photo: Kleenex)\n\nWe\u2019re actually in the midst of testing all the best tissues right now, and while we haven\u2019t yet found the winner, Kleenex is one of the front runners (along with Puffs). We recommend this eight-pack of 130-tissue boxes, as it's a great price and has enough tissues to get you through at least one or two colds.\n\nGet the Kleenex Ultra Soft Tissue 8-Pack on Amazon for $11.94\n\n8. A blender for smoothies when you're hungry but don't want to eat\n\nColds can zap your appetite, but smoothies make it easy to eat something healthy. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nWhen you're sick, it can be hard to even think about food, let alone eat it. If you have a blender, you can whip up a healthy smoothie to get all the nutrients you need. This is the best affordable blender we've ever tried, and it's great at crushing ice, blending fruits and veggies into smoothies, and even making nut butters (if that's what you're craving).\n\nGet the KitchenAid 5-Speed Diamond Blender on Amazon for $129.95\n\n9. A juicer for fresh-squeezed beverages\n\nJuice is always on the menu when you're sick. Might as well have it as fresh as possible. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nJuice is one of those comforts people crave when they're sick, but the bottled stuff is either full of added sugars or super overpriced because it's \"organic.\" If you want something fresh, a juicer can help. This Black + Decker model is easy to use and extremely affordable, so even if you only use it when you or a family member gets sick (or if you decide to save it for your next brunch party), it's well worth the cost.\n\nGet the Black + Decker Fruit and Vegetable Juice Extractor on Amazon for $37.96\n\n10. A pressure cooker for soup in an instant\n\nWhen you're sick, the faster you can make soup, the better off you'll be. (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser)\n\nWhen you get sick, the last thing you want to do is stand around in the kitchen. A pressure cooker makes it insanely easy to whip up a whole heap of steaming chicken soup. I love this recipe from Damn Delicious, and it's even easier if you splurge on precut veggies. You're sick, you deserve it.\n\nWe found the best electric pressure cooker to be the Instant Pot Ultra. It offers a simple dial, a comprehensive display complete with a progress graph, and has a safer steam valve than other models.\n\nGet the Instant Pot Ultra on Amazon for $100.97\n\n11. A slow cooker so you don\u2019t have to worry about dinner\n\nStart your soup in the morning, and then keep it warm so you can nibble all night. (Photo: Hamilton Beach)\n\nIf you don't have or want to buy a pressure cooker, a slow cooker can be super handy too. You can dump all your ingredients into the pot in the morning, sleep all day, and have dinner ready when you are. This one from Hamilton Beach is one of the best affordable slow cooker we've tested, and the locking lid is great if you're delivering soup to one of you sick loved ones.\n\nGet the Hamilton Beach Programmable Slow Cooker on Amazon for $58.47\n\n12. A heated blanket so you can cozy up anywhere that's comfy\n\nStay extra warm and cozy when you have the energy to get out of bed and sit on the couch. (Photo: Sunbeam)\n\nWhen you're feeling better enough to drag yourself out of bed and onto the couch, you should still stay cozy. A heated throw is the perfect way to stay warm. While we haven't tested heated blankets officially, I have one of these at home. It's simple, but I love it, especially for the price. It has three heat settings (low, medium, and high) and auto shuts off after a couple hours so you can doze without worry. And it's super soft and cuddly.\n\nGet the Sunbeam Microplush Heated Throw on Amazon for $39.99\n\n13. A space heater for extra warmth to ward off the chills\n\nDon't turn the heat on yet. Use this space heater instead. (Photo: Reviewed / Jonathan Chan)\n\nWhether your bedroom is a bit drafty or you\u2019re waiting as long as humanly possible to turn on the heat, a space heater can help warm your bones when you\u2019ve got a cold.\n\nMost of the models you\u2019ll come across require you to curl up in front of them to benefit from their warmth. The best space heater we\u2019ve ever tested, however, not only warms up the air in front of it, but can raise the temperature of the whole room without issue.\n\nGet the Delonghi HMP1500 Mica Panel Heater on Amazon for $86.79\n\n14. An oil diffuser so you can enjoy getting your sense of smell back\n\nSometimes the right smell can improve your mood and maybe even help you feel a little better. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nAn aromatherapy diffuser can be great to run while you're under the weather. You can use calming scents to help get you ready for sleep or try oils that can help clear your nasal passages, like eucalyptus. We ranked InnoGear's as the best essential oil diffuser because it's got a larger tank so you can run it longer than others. The color-changing lights are also great for lighting that won't blind you in the middle of the night.\n\nGet the InnoGear Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser on Amazon for $15.99\n\n15. A dehumidifier if it's actually just allergies\n\nIf your cold is actually just allergies, a dehumidifier can help. (Photo: LG)\n\nIf what you thought was a cold is actually allergies or aggravated asthma symptoms, a humidifier will only make things worse. For this, you\u2019d want a dehumidifier that dries out the air. We found that this one from LG removed more moisture from the air than all the others we tested, earning it the title of the best dehumidifier of 2019. Dehumidifiers are not cheap, but they can make a huge difference in the air quality of your home.\n\nGet the LG Energy Star PuriCare 70-Pint Dehumidifier on Amazon for $258\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
