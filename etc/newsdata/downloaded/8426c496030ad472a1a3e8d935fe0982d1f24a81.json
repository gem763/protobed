It is worth reading the missive from @realDonaldTrump in full:\n\n\u201cRep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people. It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason?\u201d\n\nWere the collective nerve endings of the electorate not so frayed and numbed by now, we might be even more alive to the ugliness of this message from the White House. One of the consequences of the Trump Presidency is the way that it constantly diminishes our expectations of anything other than hideous rhetoric and action. But there are those who are intensely aware of the potential consequences of such a threat. Sources close to Schiff told The New Yorker today that Democrats in Congress are deeply worried about the President using Twitter to incite violence and to direct it at specific members.\n\nThe threat to Schiff via Twitter came just a few days after the President, speaking at the United States Mission to the United Nations, said that whoever provided information to the whistle-blower about his July 25th telephone call with the President of Ukraine was \u201cclose to a spy.\u201d Trump went on to wax nostalgic about how spies were dealt with \u201cin the old days\u201d\u2014with the death penalty, in other words. \u201cAs soon as I heard that, I thought, He has the soul and the mind of an authoritarian,\u201d Nicholas Burns, a former high-ranking diplomat who has served in Republican and Democratic Administrations, told me. \u201cWhat other President in American history would say that?\u201d\n\nThe offhanded encouragement of vengeance, even violence, is hardly new or unusual for Trump. Some selections from the anthology of incitement:\n\n\u201cIf you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would ya?\u201d he told the crowd at a February, 2016 rally in Iowa. \u201cI promise you, I will pay the legal fees.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the good old days, they\u2019d rip him out of that seat so fast. But, today, everybody\u2019s politically correct,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Oklahoma. \u201cOur country\u2019s going to Hell with being politically correct.\u201d\n\nIn Wilmington, North Carolina, Trump issued a winking endorsement of violence against his opponent, Hillary Clinton, who, he said, might go so far as to appoint judges who favor gun-control laws. \u201cIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAlthough the Second Amendment people\u2014maybe there is, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nMore than three years later, Trump has intensified the search into his singular obsession: Hillary Clinton\u2019s e-mails. Details seem to emerge almost hourly about the extent of his corruption and subterfuge. On Monday, the Times reported that Trump behaved with the Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, much as he had with the Ukrainian leader, pressing Morrison in a recent telephone call to assist Attorney General William Barr and the Justice Department in an attempt to undermine the findings of the Mueller report. The Washington Post then added to the miserable picture, reporting that Barr had held private meetings overseas with various foreign-intelligence officials to get them to investigate and ultimately help to discredit the findings of the C.I.A. and other U.S. intelligence agencies about Russian interference in the last Presidential election.\n\nThe onset of an impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives\u2014an initiative that is gathering increasing public support during an election season\u2014is sure to elicit more, and increasingly lurid, threats of retribution from the President. As a result, anxiety throughout the federal government has deepened. \u201cThis is a time of real fear inside the State Department,\u201d Burns, a former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, told me. Diplomats throughout the foreign service became particularly concerned when, in May, the Administration recalled the Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Widely considered a deeply knowledgeable, experienced, and nonpartisan diplomat, Yovanovitch had wound up on the wrong side of the Trump circle, including Rudolph Giuliani and Donald Trump, Jr., who referred to her on Twitter as a \u201cjoker.\u201d According to the government account of his call with the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump said ominously that Yovanovitch was \u201cgoing to go through some things.\u201d\n\nBurns, who is now an informal and unpaid adviser to Joe Biden on foreign-policy issues, told me that Trump\u2019s disregard of democratic norms has reached such a point of crisis that \u201cthe floodgates are now going to open, and people inside the White House and the federal government may now come forward to the inspector generals inside the system. This President has overturned much of what has made us great. And that, I think, is appalling to career people.\u201d\n\nSenator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, told me that the Administration is propagating a long-held conspiracy theory to justify its behavior. \u201cMy understanding is that Trump, Giuliani, and others in the Administration believe that there is a deep-state conspiracy in the State Department against the President and that Masha Yovanovitch was part of this.\u201d Her recall from Kiev, he said, \u201cwas a consequence of that conspiracy theory.\u201d\n\nThe Deep State conspiracy theory is hardly confined to the West Wing, Murphy went on: \u201cI hear this, too, from my Republican Senate colleagues. There is a belief that there is a group in every corner of the government that is out to get Trump. There really are morally centered people who find him deeply distasteful, and it is required of them to raise questions of corruption if they see it. The Trump Administration sees that as a conspiracy.\u201d\n\nMurphy is hardly revealing a deeply held Republican secret. On Fox News, Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s senior policy adviser, told Chris Wallace that the whistle-blower was \u201ca deep-state operative, pure and simple.\u201d The whistle-blower\u2019s report, he added, was little more than a \u201cseven-page Nancy Drew novel.\u201d\n\nWallace pushed back against these talking points, calling Miller\u2019s answers \u201cobfuscation.\u201d Then Wallace played a video of Joseph Maguire, the acting director of National Intelligence, testifying before the House Intelligence Committee last week that the whistle-blower and the inspector general who brought the report forward had acted \u201cby the book and followed the law.\u201d\n\nAmong the most pressing questions being discussed now in Washington is how long Republican members of Congress and former White House officials will continue to show fealty to Trump. \u201cI am still stunned that Republicans are circling the wagons in the way that they are,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThey may just decide to ride this out. It may be that they are so entwined around the President, they are so stuck to him with Super Glue, that they can never come unbound.\u201d\n\nThe testimony of the whistle-blower could be a dramatic chapter in this unfolding drama. But who else might come forward to testify? One might be Yovanovitch, who has so far steered clear of speaking publicly about her dismal, and deeply unjust, fate at the hands of the Administration. Others might include Kurt Volker, who just resigned his post as special representative for Ukraine; lawyers in the White House counsel\u2019s office; and other high-ranking officials\u2014including former cabinet secretaries, national-security advisers, and chiefs of staff\u2014who may finally see no point in reserving their soured descriptions of Trump for deep-background sessions with reporters and authors. They may soon decide it is time to speak in their own names, for the sake of history, decency, and their reputations. And finally: What level of perfidy in the White House, what permutation of public opinion, will it take before Mitch McConnell decides he can no longer continue his cynical marriage to Trump?\n\nIt can be assumed that the President will go on using the weapons he learned at the feet of Roy Cohn: constant attack, ruthless threats, the shameless propagation of conspiracy theories. John Dean, whose testimony helped to tip the scales against Richard Nixon in the Watergate affair, told me that the character of Donald Trump insures that this story could get far uglier than it already is.\n\n\u201cEven Nixon would be offended by this effort to use foreign assistance for a very personal, political reason, which is a very corrupting undertaking,\u201d Dean said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump has any morals or shame. He will do anything to get re\u00eblected. . . . It\u2019s just the way Trump thinks. He doesn\u2019t care. He will destroy anybody. I find him a deeply troubling character. When he first went in, I worried that his ignorance would get us in trouble. Now it\u2019s his disposition that I find most troubling of all.\u201d", "description": "David Remnick on how Donald Trump\u2019s incitements to violence against Representative Adam Schiff and others, in the wake of the whistle-blower report about his call with the Ukrainian President, may urge other insiders to come forward.", "authors": ["David Remnick", "Rachel Aviv", "Charles Bethea", "Haruki Murakami", "Michael Luo", "David Rohde"], "top_image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5d9275c1683d6d000807a8f5/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/Remnick-TrumpImpeachmentDeepState-2b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
