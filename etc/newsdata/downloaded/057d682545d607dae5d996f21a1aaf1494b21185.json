He said its investors were on the same page about this vision as well \u2014 and on Tuesday, Snyk announced it closed $70 million in funding, which was led by Accel and existing investors GV and Boldstart Ventures.\n\n\"We have to expect and understand how we're building the right product,\" Podjarny told Business Insider. \"We want to build the best developer experience and continue to grow the product to make sure it meets the commercial needs of customers ... I think you're always in existential mode when you're a startup, but we've never lost conviction around the path.\"\n\nSnyk creates open-source security tools, which are free for anyone to use, download, or modify. For more advanced features, Snyk also offers paid versions, but the free tools make it easier for its community of developers to try out.\n\nWith the funding, Snyk plans to further expand internationally, develop more products, and generally reach more customers. But first and foremost, Snyk CEO Peter McKay says he wants to make sure Snyk doesn't lose the \"fanatical focus\" it has on customers and that it continues to recruit top talent.\n\n\"As you grow and people have been with you for three to four years, you want to make sure the culture of your company stays strong,\" McKay told Business Insider. \"You don't want to be in a situation where your growth outstretches your talent.\"\n\n'We don't just find security problems, we fix them'\n\nWhen Podjarny cofounded Snyk in 2015, he wanted to start a company that made it easier for developers to secure the software they were building.\n\n\"That's the driver for it,\" Podjarny said. \"I think the desire and the appreciation that you want developers to embrace security is an old one. We've known it for a long time.\"\n\nIt settled on a very particular niche: The Snyk tool automatically finds and fixes known security flaws in the open-source software that forms the core of many modern apps. Open-source software, which is traditionally developed by armies of volunteer developers, is at the heart of the modern software industry \u2014 but popular open-source packages sometimes have security flaws that could hypothetically give attackers a way in.\n\n\"For many customers we are the first solution they embrace,\" Podjarny said. \"We don't just find security problems, we fix them ... That really is a unique property of what we build.\"\n\nNow Snyk's reputation in the security world, and its very specific solution, helped Snyk quickly attract investors, McKay said. In fact, investors proactively reached out to the company and said they were looking to invest.\n\n\"They sought us out because they liked the developer-first model,\" McKay said. \"They liked the focus on tools for developers to be more secure.\"\n\nWhat's more, Podjarny said security has become more necessary as developers release code faster, and there's now been a wave of developer-focused companies that have either gone public or will soon, like PagerDuty, CrowdStrike, and Datadog.\n\nA 'bottom-up business'\n\nJust in July, Snyk acquired DevSecCon, a conference dedicated to development, security, and operations. Podjarny said that with DevSecCon, Snyk wants to provide more support for developer teams and help them understand the key issues in cybersecurity better.\n\n\"We want to help share our knowledge as well as facilitate collaboration and case studies amidst that community, so we continue to invest there,\" Podjarny said.\n\nRead more: 7 cybersecurity startups to bet your career on in 2019\n\nPodjarny said it was thanks to its community that Snyk has been able to expand quickly, and over the past year, he has seen lots of growth in its projects.\n\n\"I think the key thing to highlight is the community mobility and adoption,\" Podjarny said. \"In the last year we've seen a big surge. Snyk has been a bottom-up business.\"", "description": "Snyk's new funding round was led by Accel and existing investors GV and Boldstart Ventures.\u00a0Its founder said it grew quickly because of its community.", "authors": ["Rosalie Chan"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d72f66e2e22af31216c2ff4-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
