Perhaps unsurprisingly for a series that begins with a three-way (which is\u2014very rudely!\u2014interrupted by a slasher murderer), Murphy wanted the clothes to \u201cdrip in sex.\u201d\n\nBradley, a longtime Murphy collaborator, is no stranger to such requests. After all, she and producer Lou Eyrich put Sarah Paulson, Jessica Lange, Stevie Nicks, and company in vintage Yves Saint Laurent and thigh-high stilettos for last year\u2019s AHS: Apocalypse, which garnered Bradley an Emmy nomination.\n\nThis go around, Bradley took the reins for costume-designing 1984. Set at a spooky summer camp where a group of friends are hunted by an escaped convict, Bradley knew she was going to have to wage a war against a lot of blood-stained clothes. But first, she relished the era Murphy chose to set his story in.\n\n\u201cI was a fashion student through the 1980s, and I think that\u2019s the last time we were so creative and had so much fun with clothes,\u201d Bradley, who cut her teeth under the mentorship of John Galliano at London\u2019s Royal College of Art, told The Daily Beast.\n\nAs a Brit, Bradley had never been to summer camp. She calls it just \u201cCamp,\u201d as in this year\u2019s Met Gala theme. Since this is a Ryan Murphy production we\u2019re talking about, the outfits skew less khaki and scrunchies and more skin-tight short shorts.\n\n\u201cRyan asked for high-waist jeans, midriff, Jane Fonda,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cThe fantastic thing about working with Ryan is that his vision expands further than the setting. We\u2019re at camp, but he still wants it sexy and fashion, so he writes that journey into the story.\u201d\n\nThe journey begins when Brooke (Emma Thompson), who is either an ingenue or angel of death\u2014her clean-cut facade begins to unravel in the second episode\u2014makes a few friends at an L.A. aerobics class. The crew (played by Billie Lourd, Cody Fern, Gus Kenworthy, and DeRon Horton) invite Brooke to spend the summer with them as counselors at Camp Redwood.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, it was the scene of a grisly murder back in the \u201970s which its new owner, the Bible-thumping Margaret (Leslie Grossman), survived. For good measure, a fictionalized version of the real-life serial killer Richard Ramirez, aka the Night Stalker, also prowls around the camp, after attempting but failing to make Brooke one of his victims.\n\nIn an eerie turn of events, unlike past seasons, 1984 shoots under the cover of darkness, from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. Half of Bradley\u2019s 15-person team clocks in during the daytime, and the others work overnight. \u201cI have established at 1 o\u2019clock in the morning, and I\u2019ve done a fitting at 4 o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d Bradley said of her manic schedule.\n\n\u201c The fabrics have to have some bit of texture, shine, or something to bump the light, or else they would be bopping heads through the dark. \u201d \u2014 Lou Eyrich\n\nThe graveyard shift impacts how the actors are dressed. \u201cYou can\u2019t have black clothing [when you\u2019re shooting nights],\u201d Eyrich, the producer, explained. \u201cThe fabrics have to have some bit of texture, shine, or something to bump the light, or else they would be bopping heads through the dark.\u201d\n\nIt helps that Murphy\u2019s preferred color palette, which he decreed to Bradley, is pastels. \u201cIt\u2019s very youthful and hopeful,\u201d Bradley mused. \u201cThese kids are at the beginning of their lives, the most exciting years, and I think pastels play into that optimism.\u201d\n\nOf course, given all the carnage, some of these characters are also at the end of their lives, too. And all that eye-stabbing and slashing draws a lot of fake blood\u2014no friend to soft pink hues.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, we just use many, many multiples of costumes,\u201d Bradley said. Her team starts with pulling real vintage from stores and markets, then reproducing nearly every costume to make sure there is a clean set for necessary retakes.\n\n\u201cYou make a schedule, like a chart, for every outfit,\u201d Eyrich said. \u201cSay the characters are clean when they\u2019re leaving an aerobics class. Then, they fall out of a car. Then, they\u2019re running through the woods, then they fall into the water and get stabbed. You do a whole breakdown of their journey, and then count how many outfits that adds up to.\u201d\n\nOne of Bradley\u2019s favorite looks from this season is a goody-goody rainbow knit sweater, complete with a white doily collar, she put on Emma Roberts\u2019 character. She found it at the Pickwick Vintage Show, where dozens of vendors from Southern California gather to hawk their finds.\n\n\u201cOf course, Ryan picked the sweater for a scene that plays a lot,\u201d Bradley says. She only had a week to make six replicas, even though \u201cyou generally need about six weeks to make a sweater.\u201d Bradley calls the jumper \u201cthe biggest accomplishment\u201d of season nine, sartorially-speaking.\n\nThough part of the season had already aired by the time Bradley spoke for this interview, the costume designer still had five episodes left to shoot. The '80s may be fun to watch on screen, but behind the scenes her team works at breakneck speed.\n\n\u201cThe speed of TV is immense,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no failure, no \u2018No.\u2019 If you can\u2019t find a costume and it\u2019s not there, then you have to come to a different solution. If you have to have something by morning, you will find it.\u201d", "description": "Paula Bradley designed the outfits worn on this season of the spooky franchise, which includes spandex, short shorts, and one very special rainbow sweater.", "authors": ["Alaina Demopoulos", "Style Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569995181/191001-demoupoulous-AHS-Costume-tease_jqdx4t"}
