And the best strategy for him to avoid impeachment by the House and perhaps even removal by the Senate is to admit it, apologize, and let voters make their own judgment. It\u2019s also the best way to fend off a disaster for Senate Republicans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president is accused \u2014 politically, not criminally \u2014 of trying to force the Ukrainian president to tar former vice president Joe Biden with an investigation into his alleged \u201ccorruption\u201d in exchange for the release of military aid and a meeting in the Oval Office. I believe a plain reading of the rough transcript of a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky supports the charge. So does testimony from the top American diplomat in Ukraine, William Taylor, as well as several other Trump appointees and aides, including Tuesday\u2019s testimony from Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council staffer who listened to the phone call. There\u2019s still due diligence to be done, but it seems implausible they\u2019re all lying.\n\nCommon sense also works against the president. If Trump were sincerely concerned about Ukrainian corruption, why has he never expressed similar concerns about corruption anywhere else? And, why, if the issue is Ukrainian corruption generally, did the Trump administration focus on the alleged corruption of a single Ukrainian firm, Burisma, where Biden\u2019s son sat on the board?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most plausible explanation is twofold. First, the corruption issue was a pretext; under the law, corruption concerns are the only justification for blocking congressionally approved aid. Second, Trump\u2019s real goal was to bruise Biden. Indeed, according to Taylor, the White House said it would settle for a mere statement about Biden\u2019s potential corruption \u2014 meaning Trump cared more about political gain than about an actual investigation.\n\nTrump and his defenders are still pounding on outdated, unpersuasive, or irrelevant talking points. They rail about the identity and motives of the whistleblower who first aired these allegations, even though the whistleblower\u2019s report has been largely corroborated by others. They claim that the process of the Democratic inquiry in the House is unconstitutional, which is ridiculous. They insist that hearings where Republicans can cross-examine witnesses are a \u201cstar chamber\u201d or reminiscent of secret Soviet trials. Also ridiculous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublican complaints about the heavy-handed tactics of the Democrats have some merit, but they\u2019ll be rendered moot when the Democrats move to public hearings or to a Senate trial. And when that happens, claims that the call was \u201cperfect\u201d and that there was no quid pro quo will evaporate in the face of the facts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is why the smartest Trump defenders are counseling the president to simply admit the obvious: There was a quid pro quo, and the president\u2019s phone call fell short of perfection, but nothing he did is an impeachable offense.\n\nAs former federal prosecutor (and my old National Review colleague) Andrew McCarthy argues, by insisting there was no quid pro quo, the president made things much easier for Democrats. The implicit concession in Trump\u2019s position is that if the charges were true, they would be impeachable. That is a burden of proof that no doubt warms the cockles of Adam Schiff\u2019s heart. The smarter course is to admit it happened but, as McCarthy writes, \u201cno harm no foul.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019d go one step further. Rather than take the Mick Mulvaney line and shout \u201cget over it\u201d \u2014 now a Trump-campaign T-shirt \u2014 the president should apologize. Trump\u2019s refusal to admit any wrongdoing imperils GOP senators who are already reluctant to defend him on the merits. Once the process complaints expire, they\u2019ll be left with no defense at all. Bill Clinton fended off removal in the Senate in no small part because he admitted wrongdoing and asked the country for forgiveness. Once he did that, he and his supporters were liberated to say the country should \u201cmove on.\u201d It\u2019s worth recalling that the first existential crisis of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign \u2014 his talk about groping women on the Access Hollywood tape \u2014 was averted by the first, and last, meaningful apology anyone can remember from him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI disagree with those who say that the allegations against Trump are not impeachable. But, politically, apologizing could forestall impeachment by giving politicians and voters a safe harbor: \u201cIt was wrong, but he said he\u2019s sorry. Move on.\u201d The longer the president defends a lie, the more Americans will resent being lied to.\n\nOf course, contrition doesn\u2019t come easy for Trump and would be embarrassing for him and his media cheerleaders. But it would also give Republican candidates a rationale for opposing impeachment that they could sell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump is fond of demanding ever more loyalty from Republicans. But loyalty is a two-way street. If he thinks they should defend him, he should give them something defensible to work with.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency, LLC", "description": "Contrition doesn\u2019t come easy for Trump and would be embarrassing for him and his media cheerleaders.
