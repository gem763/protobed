Council stresses transparency in Jack Evans ethics probe", "language": "en", "text": "D.C. Council members convened an ad hoc committee Tuesday, stressing that transparency will be a priority as the panel proceeds with its ethics investigation of council member Jack Evans.\n\n\u201cAnything we do, as far as I am concerned, the presumption is that it is open and available to the public,\u201d said council member Mary Cheh, Ward 3 Democrat and chair of the ad hoc committee.\n\nThe 13-member council voted unanimously Tuesday on a resolution giving the committee subpoena power and directing it to offer recommendations within 90 days of receiving a law firm\u2019s investigative report on Mr. Evans. The resolution also authorizes the general counsel to enforce subpoenas if witnesses fail to comply with them.\n\nThe D.C. Council hired the O\u2019Melveny & Myers law firm in July to conduct an investigation to determine whether Mr. Evans violated the council\u2019s code of conduct. Mr. Evans, Ward 2 Democrat, resigned from the Metro Board of Directors after the transit agency accused him of an ethics breach in failing to disclose his business dealings with potential Metro contractors. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nNicole Streeter, the D.C. Council\u2019s general counsel, said Tuesday she expects to receive the report from O\u2019Melveny & Myers on Nov. 1, adding that the report will be distributed simultaneously to the ad hoc committee to begin review.\n\nMs. Streeter said the report will be made public after she redacts any information that would violate attorney-client privilege, as well as personal information like cellphone numbers and email addresses.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s ad hoc committee meeting, Mrs. Cheh said O\u2019Melveny & Myers attorneys will attend the panel\u2019s next meeting to answer questions about the report and lawmakers will discuss their initial impressions. The 12-member committee includes every council member except Mr. Evans.\n\n\u201cI hope that as we go forward, we will get consensus on the issues we take up. If that is not possible, we will vote,\u201d Mrs. Cheh said, adding that it would take a majority vote to take action such as entering an executive session or requesting further investigation, and that a tie vote would mean a measure has failed.\n\nIf the committee does not vote to do more investigation, its third meeting will be dedicated to hearing from Mr. Evans, she said.\n\nMrs. Cheh said the committee will discuss possible disciplinary action at its fourth meeting. Such action could be a reprimand, censure, expulsion or an action not outlined in the council\u2019s code of conduct such as removing Mr. Evans from all committee assignments.\n\nThe committee will conclude with its last meeting, at which time members will vote on their recommendation and make it available to the full council, she said.\n\nIn addition to the report, the committee will consider the Board of Ethics and Government Accountability settlement with Mr. Evans, as well as the Metro ethics investigation, Mrs. Cheh said.\n\nSeveral council members raised concerns about what kinds of information would be redacted for the public version of the investigative report.\n\nThe law firm was supposed to have completed its investigation over the summer, but many of the witnesses refused to comply with subpoenas to be interviewed, delaying the report.\n\nBefore recessing for the summer, the council stripped Mr. Evans of his chairmanship of the Finance and Revenue Committee, after having reprimanded him over the findings of the Metro investigation.\n\nMr. Evans, the District\u2019s longest-serving lawmaker, also is being investigated by federal authorities. He is facing a grassroots recall campaign and several challengers in next year\u2019s Democratic primary.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
