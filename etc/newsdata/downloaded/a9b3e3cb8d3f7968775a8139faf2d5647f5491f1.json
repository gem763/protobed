As a result, as of Thursday afternoon, more than 39,000 homes were inundated, the figure more than doubling from Wednesday's count, and some 2,200 homes were partially or completely destroyed, according to the internal affairs ministry.\n\nThe total flooded area surpassed the 18,500 hectares affected after last year's torrential rain disaster in western Japan, which killed more than 200 people.\n\nThe number of deaths, large-scale housing collapses and extensive disruptions to electricity, water and gas supplies are among the factors the government takes into consideration in determining the severity of a disaster.\n\nIt will be the sixth disaster in Japan to be designated as an extraordinary disaster following such calamities as the 1995 earthquake that hit Kobe and its surrounding region and the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in the northeastern region of Tohoku.\n\nThe weather agency warned of more rain from Friday through Saturday in northeastern and eastern Japan after the typhoon claimed the lives of 77 and left about a dozen missing.\n\nTemperatures dropped to the season's lows in hard-hit northeastern Japan, leaving many evacuees weary after sleeping on thin mats at shelters for days.\n\n\"It was cold. I couldn't sleep well as I also worried whether I can return home,\" said 56-year-old Tomoko Yamaki at an evacuation center in the town of Marumori in Miyagi Prefecture, which logged 4.6 C in the morning.\n\nAs of 2 p.m., 4,063 people were taking shelter at evacuation centers in 11 of Japan's 47 prefectures.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Thursday the government will take steps under a special law to fully support people living in areas affected by Typhoon Hagibis.
