Photo: Mirrorpix/Getty Images\n\nBecause I am a literary critic, my friends and family are constantly on the receiving end of my recommendations for what they should read next. The only downside of this is that, when it comes to the holidays, giving books as presents can seem like I\u2019ve barely made any effort \u2014 and that\u2019s before you even get into the often-fraught business of picking something suitable for someone who has always got their head in a book, especially if they\u2019re the kind of reader who keeps up with the latest releases. When a good friend of mine, a fellow Judy Blume fan, recently got married, I couldn\u2019t think of a more perfect gift than a 1978 first printing of Blume\u2019s novel for adults, Wifey. So I headed to the Second Shelf in London\u2019s Soho, a treasure trove of rare books, modern first editions, manuscripts, and rediscovered works by women, and they found me a copy in great condition in a matter of days.\n\nBut when an already-beloved title isn\u2019t an option, you could do worse than match a contemporary favourite with a lesser-known volume from the past. Since the beginning of the year, I\u2019ve been writing a monthly column, \u2018Re-Covered\u2019, for The Paris Review about out-of-print and forgotten books that shouldn\u2019t be, so I can attest to the fact that there are plenty of options out there if you know what you\u2019re looking for. When it comes to buying first editions online, Amazon is an obvious starting point; click the \u2018Used & New\u2019 option for any title searched. AbeBooks is a must, as it has a huge selection, and, thanks to helpful search criteria, it\u2019s easy to hone in on the specific edition you have in mind. And I\u2019ve tracked down more than a few gems on eBay in my time, too. Oxfam has a pretty good online secondhand bookshop complete with first editions, signed copies, and antiquarian lists, and although it\u2019s nowhere near as exhaustive a selection as that offered by the other sites mentioned, buying from it does make for more ethical shopping.\n\nFor fans of Jia Tolentino\n\nThe White Album, by Joan Didion (First Edition) She has been hailed as the millennial Joan Didion, so any fan of Jia Tolentino\u2019s essay collection, Trick Mirror, is bound to be excited by a first edition of one of Didion\u2019s books. Luckily, these are still fairly easy to come by and won\u2019t break the bank, either. Sticking with essays, \u2018The White Album\u2019 (1979), with its now-iconic typographic cover, is a good place to start. \u00a334 at Abe Books Buy\n\nTrick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion, by Jia Tolentino \u00a310 (was \u00a315, now 33% off) \u00a310 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nFor fans of Elena Ferrante\n\nEarly Spring, by Tove Ditlevsen (Women in Translation Series) Readers who found themselves afflicted with #FerranteFever or those who\u2019ve been devouring Natalia Ginzburg\u2019s work should look to the Danish poet and novelist Tove Ditlevsen for their next European-women-writers-in-translation fix. As yet, little of her work is available in English, but back in the 1980s, the Women\u2019s Press published the first two volumes of her autobiographical trilogy \u2014 those that deal with Ditlevsen\u2019s account of growing up in a working-class district in Copenhagen in the 1920s and \u201930s and her ambition to become a writer \u2014 under the title Early Spring. Or, if you want the full set of memoirs, Penguin Modern Classics have just published all three volumes (\u2018Childhood\u2019, \u2018Youth\u2019, and \u2018Dependency\u2019), the last of which charts Ditlevsen\u2019s success as a writer, her four marriages, and her crippling opioid addiction. Just a note: The book cover shown above is from the Seal Press (Seattle) run in 1985; there are copies of the Women\u2019s Press run available but no images online. \u00a33 at Abe Books Buy\n\nFor fans of Kerry Hudson\n\nLowborn: Growing Up, Getting Away, and Returning to Britain's Poorest Towns, by Kerry Hudson \u00a310 (was \u00a315, now 33% off) \u00a310 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nFor fans of Margaret Atwood\n\nI Who Have Never Known Men, by Jacqueline Harpman \u00a36 (was \u00a39, now 33% off) Anyone who was counting down the days prior to the release of Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments last month is bound to be intrigued by Belgian writer Jacqueline Harpman\u2019s cryptic, speculative I Who Have Never Known Men, the story of 39 women imprisoned deep in an underground bunker. First written in French in 1995 and translated into English in 1997 as The Mistress of Silence, the book was published in a rather chic Vintage paperback edition earlier this year. \u00a36 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nFor fans of Sally Rooney\n\nOdd Girl Out, by Elizabeth Jane Howard (First Edition) If the complicated romantic entanglements in Sally Rooney\u2019s Conversations With Friends had you intrigued, try Elizabeth Jane Howard\u2019s Odd Girl Out, another captivating story about a younger woman who inveigles her way into the middle of an older couple\u2019s relationship. A copy of the 1972 first edition is well worth spending that little bit extra on for the dust-jacket artwork alone. \u00a34 at Abe Books Buy\n\nFor fans of Andrea Levy\n\nThe Nowhere Man, by Kamala Markandaya (First Edition) The Nowhere Man, by Indian writer Kamala Markandaya, is an obvious but not widely known predecessor to Andrea Levy\u2019s prizewinning Small Island. Set in 1968, the novel follows an Indian immigrant living in the London suburbs as he is forced to deal with the racist hatred fired up by Enoch Powell\u2019s \u2018Rivers of Blood\u2019 speech. Track down a 1972 first edition or buy the recent reissue from Hope Road Press\u2019s Small Axes imprint. \u00a323 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nFor fans of Jenny Offill\n\nDaddy's Gone A-Hunting, by Penelope Mortimer (First Edition) With its portrayal of a suburban housewife and mother\u2019s ennui, Penelope Mortimer\u2019s Daddy\u2019s Gone A-Hunting will be a hit with those who\u2019ve gobbled up the recent glut of motherhood writing, from Rachel Cusk\u2019s A Life\u2019s Work through Jenny Offill\u2019s The Department of Speculation. The iconic dove-grey cover of the Persephone Books reprint is delightful, but if you\u2019re looking for something really special, the 1958 first edition is sure to make an impression. \u00a315 at Abe Books Buy\n\nFor fans of Margo Jefferson\n\nThe Living Is Easy, by Dorothy West (First Edition) Readers of Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning critic Margo Jefferson\u2019s Negroland \u2014 her memoir about growing up as part of \u201cthe colored aristocracy\u201d in 1950s Chicago \u2014 will discover further insight into this world in Dorothy West\u2019s elegant novels about the East Coast black bourgeoisie. Her depiction of multigenerational race relations has won her comparisons to William Faulkner, but the poise of her prose has more in common with British women writers of the mid-century. Either get the new Virago Modern Classics edition of The Wedding or, if you fancy really splashing out, hunt down one of the now rare \u2014 and thus understandably pricey \u2014 first editions of West\u2019s 1948 debut, The Living Is Easy. \u00a3379 at Abe Books Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
