A suicide car bomber detonated a vehicle packed with explosives at the gate of the Belidogle airstrip, said Yusuf Abdourahman, a security official with the Lower Shabelle regional administration. Bursts of gunfire could be heard across the base after bombing, suggesting an ongoing attack on the base.\n\nSomalia\u2019s Islamic extremist rebels, al-Shabab, have claimed the responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe U.S. military uses the Belidogle airstrip base to launch drones that attack al-Shabab targets and to train Somali troops.\n\nThe second attack was by a suicide car bomber targeting Italian peacekeepers in Mogadishu.
