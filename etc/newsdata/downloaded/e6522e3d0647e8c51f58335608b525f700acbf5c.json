Ltd. (BN4.SG) reported a 30% on-year fall in its third quarter net profit, mainly as its earnings were boosted by a one-time divestment gain last year and due to higher interest expenses.\n\nNet profit in the September quarter was 159 million Singapore dollars (US$116.1 million), compared with S$227 million in the same quarter last year. Still, the third quarter net profit beat the median S$138.2 million forecast on FactSet.\n\nRevenue rose to S$2.07 billion, from S$1.29 billion, Keppel said in its quarterly earnings statement on Singapore Exchange.\n\nThe conglomerate's offshore and marine division won new contracts worth S$1.9 billion in the first nine months of 2019. Income from the property segment for the period fell to S$340 million, from S$768 million last year, it said.\n\nThe consolidation of M1 Ltd., which Keppel acquired together with Singapore Press Holdings Ltd., helped the company's investment business swing to a net profit of S$12 million for the first nine months ended September 30, it said.\n\nWrite to Yi Wei Wong at yiwei.wong@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 17, 2019 06:27 ET (10:27 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
