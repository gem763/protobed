Galveston is about 50 miles south-east of Houston.\n\nImages shared online of the two white officers leading Neely using a rope tied to his handcuffs sparked public outrage, leading to a Texas Rangers investigation and a Galveston county sheriff\u2019s office review.\n\nProtesters last month demanded that the officers\u2019 body camera footage be released. On Wednesday, officials in Galveston released two videos, one from each body camera worn by officers Patrick Brosch and Amanda Smith.\n\nIn the footage from Brosch, he can be heard asking Smith if she should go get their truck so they will not have to make Neely walk. Smith says their sergeant would not approve of the officers separating.\n\nBrosch can then be heard saying: \u201cThis is gonna look really bad.\u201d\n\nJust before the officers started leading Neely away, Brosch can again he heard saying: \u201cThis is gonna look so bad.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Neely did not immediately return a call seeking comment.\n\nIn the videos, the two officers can be heard asking Neely, who had prior arrests for criminal trespass, why he keeps sleeping in buildings. The officers seem mostly cordial as they lead Neely.\n\nAt one point, Neely, wearing a welding mask he had asked Brosch to place on his head, apparently has trouble seeing because of the mask. The mask was one of several personal belongings Neely had asked to bring with him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re walking. Let\u2019s go. Stand next to me because I\u2019m going to drag you if not. You have to stand next to me,\u201d Smith tells Neely after Brosch takes off the welding mask.\n\nAs they continue, Brosch asks Smith if she wanted to go on a street with less traffic.\n\n\u201cYeah, I want the less eyesight,\u201d Smith says.\n\nOn the videos, cars can be seen driving by the two officers and Neely and people could be seen walking on the sidewalks. At one point, a group of people ask the officers for directions.\n\nWhite officers in Texas who led black man on rope avoid criminal charges Read more\n\nThe two officers led Neely for several blocks until they reached a parking lot where their truck and horse trailer were located.\n\nIn Brosch\u2019s video, Neely can be seen standing in the parking lot for more than 10 minutes until a third officer arrives and loads him into a vehicle.\n\nGalveston\u2019s police chief, Vernon Hale, who is black, said after the arrest the officers on horseback are trained to use such techniques in crowd control situations but the officers displayed \u201cpoor judgment in this instance\u201d. He apologized and said the department has since changed its policy.\n\nOn its Facebook page on Wednesday, the Galveston police department said it had received the sheriff\u2019s office report on the arrest. Hale will use the report to determine if any further action will be taken against the two officers.", "description": "Galveston police release mounted officers\u2019 body-cam videos after their arrest of Donald Neely on suspicion of criminal trespass", "authors": ["Associated Press In Galveston"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3d6dbf957504d30a83fb231d2d12ff3b34ff25a/0_263_1561_937/master/1561.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=678fde419f2b1180f642b103feebec64"}
