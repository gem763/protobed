The news of a campaign \u201cshake-up\u201d was first reported by The Root, and McDaniel\u2019s name was first reported by Politico.\n\n\u201cOver the past two weeks, senior campaign leadership received multiple complaints regarding inappropriate behavior by Rich McDaniel,\u201d campaign spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOver the same time period, the campaign retained outside counsel to conduct an investigation. Based on the results of the investigation, the campaign determined that his reported conduct was inconsistent with its values and that he could not be a part of the campaign moving forward,\u201d she said.\n\nThe complaints about McDaniel did not involve sexual assault or rape, according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive personnel matter.\n\nMcDaniel could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nHe recently hosted a happy hour for Warren\u2019s campaign supporters to get to know one another at a pub in Atlanta. At that event he led a group of about 60 in a chants supporting the campaign.\n\nHe also frequently was on the road with Warren.\n\nMcDaniel has worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential team, as well as campaigns for Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) and Rep.
