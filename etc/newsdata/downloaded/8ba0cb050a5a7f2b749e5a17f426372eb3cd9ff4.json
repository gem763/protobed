He also singled the opposite way and stole a base in the top of the eighth inning, finishing the night 3-for-4 with three RBI and a run scored.\n\nSoto\u2019s dinger in the fourth sailed to the train tracks that sit high above the seating areas at Minute Maid Park and at least temporarily silenced a raucous orange-dyed crowd that was on its feet for much of the game. He became just the fourth player age 20 or younger to homer in the World Series, joining Mickey Mantle (1952), Andruw Jones (1996), and Miguel Cabrera (2003). Soto\u2019s fifth-inning double also came against Cole and capped a three-run fifth inning for the Nats. They were up 5-3 over the Astros at that point. Cole hadn\u2019t allowed that five or more runs in a game since back on May 22.\n\nSoto\u2019s stolen base in the eighth set another milestone, as he is now the youngest player in MLB history to record three RBI and swipe a bag in a postseason game. Note: his 21st birthday is Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\nNationals starter Max Scherzer gave up a two-out, two-strike, two-run double to Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel in the bottom of the first inning and battled baserunners pretty much the entire time he was on the mound. He needed 48 pitches to get through the first two innings, 69 pitches to get through three innings, 96 pitches to get through four innings, and his pitch count had soared to 112 by the end of the fifth. The bottom of the fifth inning was actually the first 1-2-3 frame of the night -- for either side -- and it was against the 3-4-5 hitters in the Astros\u2019 vaunted lineup: Michael Brantley, Alex Bregman, and Yuli Gurriel. Scherzer wasn\u2019t at his best, but he was better than Cole, and he ultimately picked up the win -- his first-ever in a Fall Classic.\n\nPatrick Corbin replaced Scherzer in the bottom of the sixth inning and worked around a one-out single by Yordan Alvarez to deliver a scoreless frame on 21 total pitches. He is lined up as the Nationals\u2019 Game 3 starter on Friday in Washington, and so manager Davey Martinez opted to turn to a bullpen that ranked 29th in team ERA during the regular season to finish the job.\n\nGeorge Springer greeted Tanner Rainey with a leadoff home run in the bottom of the seventh, crushing a 2-1 fastball that was clocked at 99.2 mph. It was the 14th career postseason home run for Springer, the most in Astros franchise history. He has also now gone deep in a record five consecutive World Series games dating back to Houston\u2019s championship run in 2017. Rainey rallied to strike out Jose Altuve on a wicked slider but walked the next two batters he faced, prompting the arrival of Daniel Hudson, who put out the fire with a pop-out from Gurriel and a strikeout of Alvarez.\n\nKyle Tucker hit a pinch-hit single to lead off the bottom of the eighth inning and Springer drove him in with an RBI double that bounced off the side of Adam Eaton\u2019s glove as he leaped to grab the ball along the wall in right-center field. Washington\u2019s lead had shrunk to one, and Sean Doolittle was called upon for the four-out save. Doolittle induced a lineout from Brantley to close out the eighth before retiring Bregman, Gurriel, and Carlos Correa in order in the bottom of the ninth.\n\nThe layoff was too long, they said. Cole would be too tough. None of that stuff seems to matter to these Nationals, who took out the Brewers in the NL Wild Card Game, topped the heavily-favored Dodgers in the National League Division Series, and then swept the Cardinals in the National League Championship Series. They\u2019re now up 1-0 on the Astros in the World Series.\n\nIt\u2019ll be Stephen Strasburg vs. Justin Verlander in Game 2 on Wednesday.\n\nWe\u2019re just getting started here, people.\n\n\n\nQuick Hits: According to Joel Sherman of the New York Post, Twins bench coach Derek Shelton is getting a second interview for the Mets' manager job \u2026 Luis Rojas will get a second interview for the team's managerial vacancy, per Anthony DiComo of MLB.com ...
