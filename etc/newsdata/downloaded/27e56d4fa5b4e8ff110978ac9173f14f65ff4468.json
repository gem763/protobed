A Trump administration official said this week that senior White House officials are still deciding how to handle the Wong visit and who will meet with him.\n\nBut the U.S. visit was upstaged by Germany. German human rights activists persuaded Mr. Wong to stop first in Berlin, where he met Monday with Foreign Minister Heiko Maas at a media-sponsored human rights event at the German parliament.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry criticized that meeting and is expected to lodge further protests for Mr. Wong\u2019s U.S. trip.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely wrong for German media and politicians to attempt to tap into the anti-China separatist wave,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters in a Beijing news briefing Tuesday. \u201cIt is disrespectful of China\u2019s sovereignty and an interference in China\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d\n\nAs disclosed in this space earlier, China is using hardball propaganda tactics designed to smear the Hong Kong protesters as \u201cterrorists\u201d and \u201cseparatists.\u201d\n\nMr. Wong said on Twitter that China called in the German ambassador in Beijing to protest the meeting and blocked a German news reporter from attending a government press conference.\n\n\u201cSmear tactics, rumors, mobilization by #Beijing; but accusing me \u2018separatist\u2019 doesn\u2019t stop our relentless fight for democracy,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nMr. Wong has requested meetings with Mr. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House National Security Adviser John R. Bolton, who resigned on Tuesday. The activist also is expected to meet congressional leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who in the past has been a vehement critic of Chinese human rights abuses.\n\nIn Berlin, Mr. Wong, 22, is urging the German government to pass legislation similar to the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act introduced in Congress on June 13. The bill, currently in committee, calls for supporting Hong Kong autonomy.\n\nMr. Wong also wants the German government to block the sale and export of weapons to the Hong Kong police, which have used tear gas, beatings and water canon against ongoing mass protests in the former British colony.\n\nThe activist was arrested and detained for 24 hours at Hong Kong\u2019s airport Sunday for what authorities said were violations of his bail. He was then allowed to travel to Germany and the United States.\n\nChina promised to observe Hong Kong\u2019s democratic system when it reverted to Beijing rule in 1997. Beijing, however, has been slowly squeezing the Hong Kong government, and the protests were triggered by a proposed law that would allow China to extradite Hong Kong residents to China, where courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party.\n\nDEFENSE SECRETARY ON CHINA\n\nNew Defense Secretary Mark Esper says China poses major economic and security threats to the United States and the world.\n\n\u201cDecades of robust economic growth \u2014 enabled by market reforms \u2014 have provided Beijing the financial resources to expand its influence well beyond the shores of the mainland,\u201d Mr. Esper said in a speech in London on Friday.\n\n\u201cThis alone is not a problem, however,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat is concerning is how China is using this newfound economic power.\u201d\n\nThe defense secretary described Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative as a coercive, multitrillion-dollar infrastructure development program in the developing world. The program was visible during Mr. Esper\u2019s recent visit to the Indo-Pacific region.\n\n\u201cWhat are initially presented as reasonable investments by [China] to build ports, facilities and other infrastructure end up coming with some significant strings attached,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more dependent a country becomes on Chinese investment and trade, the more susceptible they are to coercion and retribution when they act outside of Beijing\u2019s wishes.\u201d\n\nThe initiative has given Beijing political and economic leverage that has begun eroding the sovereignty of many nations.\n\nIn the end, the Chinese strategy will lead nations \u201cto make suboptimal defense decisions for fear of upsetting the Chinese Communist Party and being punished through economic measures or political backlash,\u201d Mr. Esper said.\n\nChina also continues to steal technology to bolster its military, theft Mr. Esper called \u201cstaggering.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, every Chinese company has the potential to be an accomplice in Beijing\u2019s state-sponsored theft of other nations\u2019 military and civilian technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThose companies also pose a risk to the secure and resilient telecommunications infrastructure on which our allies and partners depend for interoperability, intelligence sharing and mobilization.\u201d\n\nChina also has a cybersecurity law requiring its companies to provide technical support and assistance to public security and national security organs of government.\n\n\u201cGovernments and businesses around the world should be concerned by Chinese influence that opens them to costly deals, future coercion, loss of technical advantage or other malicious activity,\u201d Mr. Esper said.\n\nThe threat is not limited to Asia but is part of expanding Chinese influence and power around the world.\n\n\u201cFor anyone who wonders what a world dominated by Beijing might look like, I would argue all you need to do is look at how they treat their own people, within their borders,\u201d he said. \u201cOver a million ethnic minority Uighurs are in reeducation camps in Xinjiang province. Basic civil liberties such as freedom of speech and freedom of the press are routinely denied. And we all see what\u2019s happening to those who continue to speak out against the party\u2019s influence in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cI was there for the handover in 1997 when the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 designation was affirmed. I would ask you: Given what we see in Hong Kong today, has China kept those promises?\u201d\n\nF-35 STEALTH DEFENSES DETAILED\n\nAn Air Force environmental impact statement on the deployment of a new Air National Guard F-35 jet reveals new details about the advanced fighter aircraft. The Guard plans to deploy F-35 squadrons of 18 jets each at two locations in the United States, with the preferred sites in Madison, Wisconsin, and Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nThe F-35 is the military\u2019s newest fighter bomber and boasts supersonic speeds and radar-evading stealth features that allow it to fly through advanced air defenses. The 159-page report for the first time reveals that even with its low-observable design, the F-35 will employ additional defenses, including chaff and flares, designed to attract and defeat enemy electronic-guided missiles.\n\nThe F-35 \u201cemploys defense countermeasures such as chaff and flares although its stealth characteristics reduce the need for such measures,\u201d the report said. \u201cDesign features and radar-absorbent composite materials make the F-35A harder to detect than conventional aircraft of similar size.\u201d\n\nThe chaff defense consists of bundles of 5 million to 5.6 million fibers cut in ways that reflect radar signals. Released from a jet in flight, the chaff forms an \u201celectronic \u2018cloud\u2019 that breaks the radar signal and temporarily hides the maneuvering aircraft from radar detection,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe newest form of chaff is designated ARM-210 and is being tested for expected deployment next year.\n\nHigh-technology infrared flares dropped by the F-35 are designed to divert homing and heat-seeking enemy surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles. More widely used high-temperature flares are made of magnesium and burn for less than five seconds.\n\n\u201cThe burn temperature is hotter than the F-35A exhaust, so the flare attracts and decoys heat-seeking weapons and sensors targeted on the aircraft,\u201d the report said.\n\nElectronic warfare gear on the F-35 also is used to defend the jet from threats. The ASQ-239 electronic warfare system uses a high-tech active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and the antennas located throughout the aircraft.\n\nOne of its key features is a towed electronic device that is dropped from beneath the aircraft. The electronic decoy puts out signals that mimic the radar signature of the F-35 and thus can draw an enemy missile to it instead of the aircraft.\n\nThe Air Force report on F-35 defenses was first reported this week by Aviation Week.\n\n\u2022 Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter at @BillGertz.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
