EDT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody. We\u2019re going to The Villages in Ocala, Florida. We have a big crowd. We\u2019re going to be talking about healthcare. We\u2019re doing a lot of work on healthcare. We\u2019re very successful at it. And so we\u2019re going to be speaking to the great people of Florida. And I think they\u2019re very happy with the job we\u2019re doing.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ Mr. President, first question, what did you \u2014\n\nQ What exactly, specifically, is inaccurate in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: What?\n\nQ What exactly is inaccurate in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, if you look at the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, it\u2019s totally inaccurate because the conversation that I had was absolutely perfect. And most people that have read it say the same thing. The whistleblower never saw the \u2014 saw the conversation. He got his information, I guess, second- or third-hand. He wrote something that was total fiction. And now, when people see that, they\u2019re not happy.\n\nQ Do you want to restrict investment flows into China and have Chinese stocks delisted?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, we\u2019re looking at a lot of different things. China is coming in next week. We\u2019re going to have a meeting with them. We\u2019ll see. But we\u2019re doing very well.\n\nSome of the numbers, I think, are being affected by all of the nonsense, all of the politics going on in this country by the Democrats. I call them the \u201cDo-nothings.\u201d They do nothing for this country. They don\u2019t care about this country. But the numbers, really, are looking very good, going into the future.\n\nSo, we\u2019ll see. I have a lot of options on China. But if they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous \u2014 tremendous power.\n\nQ Mr. President, what exactly did you hope Zelensky would do about the Bidens after your phone call? Exactly.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I would think that, if they were honest about it, they\u2019d start a major investigation into the Bidens. It\u2019s a very simple answer.\n\nThey should investigate the Bidens, because how does a company that\u2019s newly formed \u2014 and all these companies, if you look at \u2014\n\nAnd, by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with \u2014 with Ukraine.\n\nSo, I would say that President Zelensky \u2014 if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens. Because nobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked. That was a crooked deal \u2014 100 percent. He had no knowledge of energy; didn\u2019t know the first thing about it. All of a sudden, he is getting $50,000 a month, plus a lot of other things. Nobody has any doubt.\n\nAnd they got rid of a prosecutor who was a very tough prosecutor. They got rid of him. Now they\u2019re trying to make it the opposite way. But they got rid \u2014\n\nSo, if I were the President, I would certainly recommend that of Ukraine.\n\nQ Have you asked President Xi to investigate at all?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I haven\u2019t, but it\u2019s certainly something we can start thinking about. Because I\u2019m sure that President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny, where billions of dollars is taken out his country by a guy that just got kicked out of the Navy. He got kicked out of the Navy; all of a sudden, he\u2019s getting billions of dollars. You know what they call that? They call that a \u201cpayoff.\u201d\n\nQ In your view, Mr. President \u2014 in your view, should the White House comply with any congressional subpoenas associated with the whistleblower complaint?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I leave that to the lawyers. I can say, though, that Schiff has now been proven to be a liar. We\u2019ve known it for three years, because they\u2019ve been trying to impeach for three years. He\u2019s a li- \u2014 he\u2019s a stone-cold liar. So I leave that to the lawyers. That\u2019s up to them to decide. But the whole investigation is crumbling.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ Can you still work with Congress to get other work done? Can you still work with Congress?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I can. Yeah, I can.\n\nQ How can you do that? How?\n\nQ (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You got \u2014 I \u2014\n\nQ Mr. President, Pakistan is urging (inaudible) talks with the Taliban. Are you going to do that?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, we have a real problem. We\u2019ve been hitting the Taliban very, very hard. And, as far as I\u2019m concerned, they still haven\u2019t recovered from killing 12 people \u2014 one of \u2014 happened to be a great American solider from Puerto Rico. They still have not recovered, and they probably never will.\n\nQ Mr. President \u2014 President Trump, what is McConnell \u2014 what is McConnell telling you about impeachment? Has he assured you that Senate Republicans won\u2019t vote for it?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, but I read Mitch McConnell\u2019s statement yesterday, and he read my phone call. And, as you know, he put out a statement that said that was the most innocent phone call he\u2019s read. And I spoke to him about it, too.\n\nHe read my phone call with the President of Ukraine. Mitch McConnell \u2014 he said, \u201cThat was the most innocent phone call that I\u2019ve read.\u201d I mean, give me a break. Anybody that reads it says the same thing. And the only people that don\u2019t understand it is when they look at the false, fabricated, fraudulent statement made by Shifty Schiff.\n\nQ Mr. President, Vice President Biden \u2014 Vice President Biden said that he\u2019s not going anywhere. He has said that you\u2019re not going to destroy his family. What do \u2014 what\u2019s your response?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I think Biden is going down. And I think his whole situation \u2014 because now you may very well find that there are many other countries that they scammed, just like they scammed China and Ukraine. And basically, who are they really scamming? The USA. And it\u2019s not good.\n\nQ He said he was carrying out the official policy \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And that\u2019s probably why China, for so many years, has had a sweetheart deal where China rips off the USA \u2014 because they deal like people with Biden, where they give their son a billion and a half dollars. And that\u2019s probably why China has such a sweetheart deal that, for so many years, they\u2019ve been ripping off our country.\n\nQ Do you support SB-206 \u2014 the college athletes getting paid? Or do you side with the NCAA and the schools? And do you think this should be a federal law?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re looking at it. We\u2019re looking at very closely. It\u2019s under study.\n\nQ Has North Korea gone too far this time with the ballistic missile? Is that too far?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: We\u2019ll see. They want to talk, and we\u2019ll be talking to them soon. We\u2019ll see.\n\nSo I\u2019m going to \u2014 yes?\n\nQ Mr. President, why did recall the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine? Was she a problem? Why did you recall her?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I heard very bad things about her. And I don\u2019t know if I recalled her or somebody recalled her, but I heard very, very bad things about her for a long period of time. Not good.\n\nThank you. I\u2019ll see you in Florida. I\u2019ll see you all in Florida.\n\nEND\n\n10:24 A.M.
