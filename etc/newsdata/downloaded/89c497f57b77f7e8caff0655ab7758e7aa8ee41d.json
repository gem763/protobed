One is a public \u201cproxy cost\u201d for the impact of climate-change regulations on future energy demand, and the other a greenhouse gas (GHG) cost used internally to decide how to spend on new projects like drilling and oil sands.\n\nThe \u201cproxy cost,\u201d New York claims, made it look to investors like Exxon had a more sober view of sinking demand and tougher regulations than was actually applied internally.\n\nAnd under New York law, how things look to shareholders\u2014rather than what Exxon intended\u2014may be what decides the case.\n\nLast week, witnesses were confronted with dozens of internal emails and reports about the two accounting gauges, as well as the company\u2019s communications with shareholders. Those shareholders had demanded as far back as 2013 to know how Exxon was calculating the cost of climate change.\n\nNew York has argued that Exxon intentionally misled investors by publicizing a \u201csham\u201d proxy cost, tricking the market and thus inflating the company\u2019s stock price. Exxon contends that the two costs are used for different purposes, and that New York is conflating them to show a discrepancy where there is none.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to trick ourselves with our own internal documents,\u201d Robert Bailes, Exxon\u2019s former greenhouse gas manager, testified on Friday. Indeed, none of the documents discussed at trial so far appeared to show an intentional scheme like the one New York Attorney General Letitia James alleges.\n\nRead More: How Exxon\u2019s Climate Change Trial Became a Battle Over Numbers\n\nTo be sure, the state is far from resting its case and the court has yet to hear from several witnesses, including former Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson. It\u2019s also possible that New York could unveil some heretofore unseen email or document that provides evidence of a smoking gun.\n\nThe attorney general, however, doesn\u2019t need one.\n\nJames sued under New York\u2019s Martin Act, which empowers officials to target a wide range of corporate behavior that may negatively impact shareholders. While New York claims Exxon intentionally misled shareholders, under this securities law it doesn\u2019t have to prove intent to win.\n\n\u201cThis is precisely why New York is pursuing Exxon under the Martin Act,,\u201d said James Fanto, a professor at Brooklyn Law School. \u201cNew York could prevail if it showed that Exxon\u2019s disclosure had a kind of fraudulent effect in misleading shareholders.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dispute is in how that was portrayed to the investors.\u201d\n\nNew York Supreme Court Justice Barry Ostrager, who is presiding over the nonjury trial in lower Manhattan, alluded to this Wednesday when he asked the lawyers if confusion among Exxon\u2019s shareholders was enough to trigger a Martin Act violation.\n\n\u201cWould you agree that if the disclosures that Exxon made confused investors with respect to the utilization of these two different costs, then there would be a Martin Act violation?\u201d the judge asked Exxon\u2019s lawyer Theodore Wells.\n\n\u201cNo, your Honor,\u201d Wells responded. \u201cI would state that under the law that there\u2019s a difference between somebody being confused and a statement being misleading. I think you have to look at it in context. I think the concepts are different.\u201d\n\nKevin Wallace, a lawyer for the attorney general, rejected Wells\u2019 premise, arguing that the case turns on what Exxon disclosed to the public \u201cand what the investors understood.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no dispute on the grounds about the existence of the two systems,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cThe dispute is in how that was portrayed to the investors.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s first witness, activist investor Natasha Lamb, testified that she wrote to Exxon in 2013 on behalf of clients who were concerned that climate change posed a financial risk to the company.\n\nShe sought a shareholder resolution demanding the company disclose how it was managing those risks, according to a copy of the letter, displayed on large screens in the courtroom.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- New York\u2019s $1.6 billion securities-fraud lawsuit against\u00a0Exxon Mobil begins a second week of trial Monday, after a series of witnesses didn\u2019t provide any concrete evidence that the oil giant knowingly misled shareholders about its climate change accounting.Testimony by investors and employees", "authors": ["Erik Larson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kySpH9d6ovoC1jHPHkqKCw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MTc3ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/55f5b23396ac28be8a8b9144c29b35d1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
