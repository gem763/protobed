Biya, who has ruled Cameroon for nearly 37 years, obtained 71 percent of the vote.\n\nOn Friday, 86-year-old Biya said he had ordered prosecutions to be dropped against \"some\" opposition members who had been \"arrested and detained for acts committed in contesting the results of the recent presidential elections\".\n\n\"I have ordered the discontinuance of proceedings pending before Military Tribunals against some officials and militants of political parties in particular the (MRC),\" he said in a tweet.\n\nI have ordered the discontinuance of proceedings pending before Military Tribunals against some officials and militants of political parties in particular the Cameroon Renaissance Movement (CRM).#CmrDialogue#PaulBiya #Cameroon \u2014 President Paul BIYA (@PR_Paul_BIYA) October 4, 2019\n\n191003182000375\n\nThe announcement came on the closing day of crunch talks aimed at easing a bloody crisis in the anglophone northwest and southwest regions.\n\nDecades of resentment at perceived discrimination at the hands of Cameroon's French-speaking majority boiled over two years ago into an armed campaign for independence.\n\nThe conflict has cost nearly 2,000 lives and forced half a million people to flee their homes.\n\nThe separatists have shunned the National Dialogue Conference, which began on Monday, presenting several conditions for their attendance, including the release of 10 leaders who had been sentenced to life in prison by a military tribunal in August.\n\nOn Thursday, Biya ordered the release of 333 separatist fighters arrested for misdemeanours, and delegates at conference adopted a resolution recommending \"special status\" for the English-speaking areas \"aimed at strengthening the autonomy of administrative areas\".\n\nAl Jazeera's Ahmed Idris, reporting from Yaounde, said \"regions will have more revenue to run their day-to-day activities, as well as execute projects\" and residents will eventually be able to vote for their own officials directly, including governors who were previously appointed by the federal government.\n\nWhile Biya's government and the main opposition has welcomed the recommendations as a good first step, several separatist rebels have already indicated that they remain unimpressed.\n\nEbenezer Akwanga, a prominent leader, said the people of self-described Ambazonia - the country the separatists want to carve out of Cameroon - did not \"need a special status\".\n\n\"We don't want to be a part of Cameroon,\" he said.\n\n\"Ambazonia is marching to freedom and nothing can stop us.\"", "description": "Move is latest in a series of concessions from President Paul Biya, who is under pressure over a crackdown on dissent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/5/930d9401b77e4d3cbf5c3b9428d5c6fa_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
