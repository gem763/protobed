You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMr Trump described the \u201cHowdy, Modi!\u201d rally as a \u201cprofoundly historic event\u201d, and he and Mr Modi renewed their warm personal relationship onstage by exchanging praise in speeches in English.\n\nBut it was a reference to a key phrase in Hindi that has provoked criticism for Mr Modi in India.\n\nMr Modi said he admired his counterpart\u2019s \u201csense of leadership, passion for America, concern for every American and strong resolve to make America great again\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe has already made the American economy strong again,\u201d Mr Modi said. \u201cHe has achieved much for the US and the world. Friends, we in India have connected well with President Trump.\u201d\n\nWith a smile, he added: \u201cIn the words of candidate Trump: Abki baar Trump sarkar (This time, [a] Trump government).\u201d\n\nThe line was a reference to Mr Modi\u2019s own catchy slogan Abki baar Modi sarkar, which helped propel him to power in 2014 and has been described as \u201cone of the most popular election catchphrases ever in the history of Indian elections\u201d.\n\nIt also harked back to a TV advert released by the Trump campaign in 2016 that appealed to the Indian American community for their votes, when Mr Trump himself first adopted Mr Modi\u2019s catchphrase.\n\nNonetheless, Mr Modi\u2019s emphasis on the expression on Sunday \u2013 at a time when Mr Trump is gearing up for another vote \u2013 led a spokesperson for the opposition Congress party in India to accuse Mr Modi of \u201ctaking a partisan position in [the] domestic electoral politics\u201d of another country.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
