Put those claims together, and Trump will explode in fury.\n\nThat\u2019s why Trump has been rage-tweeting about this piece in The Post, which flatly declared that Trump\u2019s attacks on nonwhite lawmakers are \u201cracist,\u201d while also reporting that even some Republicans think Trump has squandered his summer in part by resorting to such attacks.\n\nThis prompted Trump to fume at the very notion that those attacks are \u201cracist,\u201d and to suggest that they are having his desired effect: \u201cThe Democrats have become the Party of the Squad!\u201d\n\nWhich raises a question: Have Trump\u2019s fearsome attacks actually succeeded in making those four lawmakers \u2014 Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib \u2014 the face of the Democratic Party? How much of a liability is this really for Democrats?\n\nWe are now about to have our first big test case that might shed light on these questions.\n\nNext Tuesday, voters go to the polls in the closely watched special House election in North Carolina\u2019s 9th congressional district. This battle \u2014 between Democrat Dan McCready and Republican Dan Bishop \u2014 is being widely described as a big test of both sides\u2019 messaging heading into 2020.\n\nAnd in that context, here are a couple data points that raise serious skepticism about the strategy of tying Democrats to \u201cthe Squad.\u201d\n\nFirst, the vast bulk of the paid TV advertising from Republicans in this race actually does not focus on those lawmakers, Democrats familiar with ad-buy information tell me.\n\nSecond, even with those attacks, this race is effectively a tie \u2014 in a district that Trump carried by 11 points in 2016.\n\nRepublicans and their allied outside groups have run well over a dozen paid TV and radio ads against the Democrat.\n\nA number of the ads blast McCready as a money-grubbing businessman and corrupt insider (see here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here and here.) A handful attack McCready as soft on immigration (see here).\n\nSome ads do feature \u201cthe Squad.\u201d This one depicts the Squad members as inflatable clowns. This one and this one flash images of Ocasio-Cortez and Omar and label them \u201csocialists.\u201d This one also flashes their images. This one flashes a shot of Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nOf all these ads, around two-thirds don\u2019t mention the Squad at all. What\u2019s more, the ads that don\u2019t mention the Squad have vast sums of money behind them \u2014 totaling many millions of dollars, a Democrat familiar with ad-buy info tells me.\n\nBy contrast, the ads that do mention the Squad are backed by ad buys totaling a few hundred thousand dollars, that Democrat says.\n\nThat alone suggests this isn\u2019t all that effective a line of attack. On top of this, the race is a dead heat, in a district that Trump won overwhelmingly. According to the Cook Political Report\u2019s partisan voter index, the district is 8 points more Republican than the nation as a whole.\n\nYet polls show that this race remains incredibly close. Which raises the possibility that this attack on the Squad \u2014 in addition to not even being potent enough to be heavily featured in GOP ads \u2014 isn\u2019t doing much to move the needle for Republicans.\n\nMichael McAdams, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, responded this way: \u201cWe encourage all Democrats to wrap their arms around the socialist agenda of AOC and her friends if they don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a liability in 2020.\u201d\n\nA big test for the GOP\n\nThe North Carolina race is being widely touted as a test of whether Republicans can win back the sort of suburban districts they lost in 2018, with suburban white voters badly alienated by Trump voting for the Democrats in large numbers.\n\nGiven the district\u2019s pro-Trump tilt, you\u2019d think merely energizing the GOP base should be enough to win. But if Democrats can pull off a surprise win in this district, it\u2019ll suggest that the national political environment remains terrible for Republicans, with the sort of swing voters who bolted last time still so alienated by Trump that it\u2019s enough to offset even a major pro-GOP tilt.\n\nEven if Democrats lose but keep it very close, that also bodes badly for Republicans, given that pro-GOP tilt, according to Nathan L. Gonzales, the editor of the nonpartisan Inside Elections. It would show that Trump remains a serious liability for the GOP.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this would be a race if there were a different president,\u201d Gonzales told me. \u201cHe\u2019s the shadow that looms over this race.\u201d\n\nAnd so, if Democrats keep this race close, it suggests that to the degree that the national political environment is Trumpified, it remains much more of a liability for Republicans than Democrats.\n\nMichael Bitzer, an expert in North Carolina politics, told me that what happens with suburban voters in the south Charlotte area will be a good test of whether \u201cwhite, college-educated, suburban women\u201d are still \u201cmoving against the president.\u201d\n\nIn fairness, as Republicans point out, McCready had a big head start, because he already ran once in an election that was overturned due to election fraud. But still, this is a very Republican district \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t be this close.\n\nGonzales pointed to another key nuance. Even if this race is tight, next fall Republicans could still use the Squad to attack Democratic House members running for reelection, because as incumbents it might be easier to tar them with their more progressive colleagues.\n\nStill, the vast bulk of the districts that will decide who keeps the House next year are not as Republican as North Carolina\u2019s 9th District is. And if this race is close, it will suggest Trump\u2019s continued alienation of swing voters might still be outweighing whatever benefits Republicans get from his energizing of the base.\n\nAnd the attacks on the Squad, of course, typify all the ways Trump does both of those things. Indeed, even some Republicans recently told the Washington Examiner that those attacks risk further alienating the educated and suburban white swing voters that Republicans need to win back next year.\n\nSo no matter how many times Trump tweets about his own brilliance in turning Democrats into the \u201cParty of the Squad,\u201d the idea that this works for Republicans deserves serious skepticism.\n\nRead more:\n\nEugene Robinson: Trump is melting down.
