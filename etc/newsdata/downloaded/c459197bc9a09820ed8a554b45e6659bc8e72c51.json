That\u2019s the answer to all our problems. I was able to get on the board with sacks, but everybody knows the win column is the most important stat for us. It was a tough one. It\u2019s a tough patch for us.\u201d\n\nA loss to the Chargers next week would leave the Broncos with their worst start in the franchise\u2019s six-decade history.\n\nAfter becoming the first team in league annals to go the first three games of a season without a sack or a takeaway, the Broncos sacked Minshew five times.\n\nSuddenly, though, they couldn\u2019t stop the run.\n\nLeonard Fournette ran over them for a career-high 225 yards , 190 of which came in the second half highlighted by his 81-yard run.\n\n\u201cFournette is a good back. We just got beat,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t stop the run, we couldn\u2019t tackle the quarterback.\u201d\n\nHe was stumped to explain why the Broncos can\u2019t close out games.\n\n\u201cIf you play the same game four times, you\u2019ve got to get lucky and win one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t been able to get in the win column yet. But there\u2019s really no time to feel sorry for ourselves. We\u2019ve got 12 games left, it\u2019s still early in the season. We\u2019ve got a lot of ball to play.\u201d\n\nHe won\u2019t address his team as some players do in moments like this.\n\n\u201cI talk to the guys all the time. I feel like the team, they feel my vibes all the time. They feel my presence all the time,\u201d said Miller, who needed fewer games to reach 100 sacks than everyone except Reggie White, DeMarcus Ware and Bruce Smith.\n\nThe Broncos have three gut-wrenching losses under Fangio and now will try to join the 1992 Chargers as the only teams in NFL history to reach the postseason after losing their first four games.\n\nWhile Miller said he can\u2019t figure out Denver\u2019s lack of luck given the talent on the team and the coaching staff, which he said includes \u201csome of the best coaches I\u2019ve had my entire career,\u201d he knows one thing: more hard work is coming.\n\n\u201cThe only way out,\u201d Miller said, \u201cis up.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Von Miller couldn't really celebrate his 100th career regular season sack .", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/jaguars_broncos_football_39235_c0-233-5579-3485_s1770x1032.jpg?eefe8ab425ae09a3e53fdc4d80bb1572e62b90f2", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
