The Mueller report found the president pressured Sessions into reversing his recusal, which he did not do.\n\nSessions resigned after the day after the 2018 midterm election at the president's request.\n\nTrump told NBC in June that his selection of Sessions as his attorney general was his 'biggest mistake.'\n\n'I would say if I had one do-over, it would be, I would not have appointed Jeff Sessions to be attorney general,' Trump told NBC's 'Meet the Press.'\n\nThe president won Alabama with 62 per cent in 2016.\n\nMueller found no evidence of collaboration on behalf of the Trump campaign and the Justice Department - now headed by Attorney General Bob Barr - opted not to pursue an obstruction of justice charge given long-standing policy not to indict a sitting president.\n\nRoy Moore (left) is one of the five Republicans running for the right to take on Democratic Senator Doug Jones (right)\n\nRep. Bradley Byrne (top left), former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville (top right), Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill (bottom left), and state Rep. Arnold Mooney (bottom right) are also running for the Republican nomination\n\nStill it's unclear what role the president would play in the Republican primary should Sessions toss his hat in the ring.\n\nIn the 2017 Republican Senate primary, Trump supported Moore's opponent Luther Strange - even holding a rally for him - but it was Moore who ended up the nominee.\n\nThis time around, Moore has four other primary opponents - Rep. Bradley Byrne, former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, and state Rep. Arnold Mooney.\n\nSessions, if he ran, would be the sixth Republican in the primary.", "description": "Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is considering running for the Alabama Senate seat he left in order to join Donald Trump's administration.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/15/20332600-0-image-a-35_1572363035326.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
