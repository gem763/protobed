On the eve of a rare show at the V&A, he talks about inspiration, not working too hard and how he was once sacked by Richard Avedon\n\nIt\u2019s 1995 and supermodels are not getting out of bed for less than $10,000. In Richard Avedon\u2019s studio, a converted fire station on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, Nadja Auermann and Kristen McMenamy are being shot for the new Versace campaign. Both \u201csupes\u201d are almost 6ft, and their hair has been teased upwards, like a skyline, to add another couple of inches. Their frocks and suits are bold, body-conscious, all shoulders and boobs: the acme of power dressing. Avedon \u2013 whom everyone calls \u201cDick\u201d \u2013 sets his large- format, 10x8in plate camera low, shooting upwards, making Auermann and McMenamy seem even more like Amazonian deities.\n\nIn the background, meanwhile, a skinny, somewhat pasty Englishman, not quite 25, looks on. He is Avedon\u2019s fourth assistant, meaning he defers not only to the photographer but to a third assistant, a second assistant and a studio manager. His main responsibilities are changing light bulbs, emptying wastepaper bins, getting food for everyone. He\u2019s shy and a little dreamy, but he is noticing everything.\n\n\u201cMy role was very, very basic, but having to clear dog shit off the street right in front of his studio \u2013 which I had to do a lot \u2013 enabled to me to have a front-row seat in the experience of seeing Richard Avedon photograph,\u201d recalls Tim Walker, now 49 and one of the world\u2019s leading fashion photographers for two decades. \u201cI was on the front line and how Dick communicated with the subject was everything.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Avedon actually fired me. I didn\u2019t hustle enough, I was a very tragically bad photo assistant.\u2019 Photograph: James Stopforth/Tim Walker Studio\n\nHow so? \u201cDick would give them a story,\u201d Walker replies. \u201cWhen Kristen and Nadja came out in two little black suits, he was like, \u2018Oh, I think you\u2019re crows and you are on a branch. There\u2019s a worm on the floor and you\u2019re fighting for that worm.\u2019 Very simplistic, childlike scenarios that were very immediate.\u201d You can see how this played out: in one image from the shoot, McMenamy threatens Auermann with a spike-heeled shoe; in another, Auermann throws a punch while McMenamy laughs in her face.\n\nWalker didn\u2019t stay long with Avedon, only a year. \u201cHe actually fired me,\u201d says Walker, laughing. \u201cI didn\u2019t hustle enough. I was a very tragically bad photo assistant, very slow, and the people that worked for him were very quick, fiery and technically uber-experienced.\u201d\n\nAnd, really, you probably wouldn\u2019t instinctively link the two photographers: Avedon is best known for his starkly lit portraits, often set against a minimalist white background; Walker, on the other hand, has a more whimsical, fantastical aesthetic. His work, found in magazines such as Vogue, W, Love and i-D, often exists in a surreal realm somewhere between a dream and a nightmare. The scale is off, or the colours are psychedelic, or there are a pair of white horses galloping through an English stately home or the actor Margot Robbie in pink latex is poised to bomb down a slide into a cracked egg, or a model is sitting in a biplane made from a baguette.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tilda Swinton, \u2018Mr James\u2019s Daydream\u2019, Las Pozas, Mexico, 2012. Photograph: Tim Walker/Tim Walker Studio\n\nBut Avedon, who died in 2004, is never far from Walker\u2019s mind. On the day we meet, he\u2019s at a studio in east London preparing a shoot he hopes will be the final piece of work for a new exhibition at the V&A called Tim Walker: Wonderful Things. Today\u2019s images will feature models wearing extraordinary rubber \u201cballoon\u201d creations designed by Fredrik Tj\u00e6randsen, a Norwegian just graduated from Central Saint Martins who has come along to watch. Catwalk footage of the designs, which look like huge inflatable orbs until they are deflated by the wearer and turned into dresses, went viral this summer. Tj\u00e6randsen won the prestigious L\u2019Or\u00e9al young talent award and, overnight, gained 25,000 Instagram followers.\n\nWalker is slim, his dark hair and beard trimmed to the same length. His clothes \u2013 black T-shirt, shorts and Nikes \u2013 are both less strange and less \u2018fashion\u2019 than you\u2019d expect. He has no idea how the photographs will turn out, but he is already toying with Avedon-style scenarios to create a world and coax performances from the models. \u201cThis afternoon there will be a bunch of balloons being sold and they are going to be floating around and someone\u2019s bought a balloon and a child is taking them away,\u201d he muses, as we head downstairs to a caf\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019d never talk to someone and say, \u2018Stand here, face the light, pose like this\u2026\u2019\u201d Walker pauses, making his point explicit: \u201cSo yeah, I owe everything to Avedon.\u201d\n\nLooking at Walker\u2019s portfolio, you\u2019d assume he could only have survived a disturbed, deranged childhood. Except, really, it sounds like it couldn\u2019t have been more idyllic. He was born in Guildford, Surrey, but when he and his brother were little, his parents moved to an isolated spot in rural Dorset. Their summers were spent jumping fences, building tree houses and trying to dam the little river that flowed through their valley so that they could swim in it. \u201cNot that my upbringing is any better than anyone else\u2019s,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I know the privilege of growing up feral, being allowed to run around gave me a lot of what I draw on now.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stella Tennant in Dior Haute Couture dress, \u2018Japonais\u2019, London, 2016. Photograph: Tim Walker/Tim Walker Studio\n\nWhen Walker wasn\u2019t mucking about outside with his brother, he was drawing. \u201cCartoons or cartoonesque figures, extreme,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I\u2019d be drawing an extremely tall person with very, very long hair, or I\u2019d be drawing a very round person, or a very black person, a very white person, a very pink or green person. It was sort of a Mr Men language that I\u2019m still doing in a way. There\u2019s an extremity to my interest in beauty.\u201d\n\nWalker is that rare photographer who doesn\u2019t post images to Instagram. \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with people looking at technology too much, because it takes you out of reality in a relentless, needy way,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think just looking at images all in one size makes everything very linear. There\u2019s a great joy of encountering an enormous Wolfgang Tillmans print he\u2019s just stuck up with a nail on a wall in the Tate, then looking at a tiny Cecil Beaton in the National Portrait Gallery taken in the 1930s, then opening up the Sunday Times and seeing Don McCullin\u2019s pictures. Instagram is scary. Be careful. Nineteen Eighty-Four.\u201d\n\nAfter school, Walker spent a few months cataloguing the Cecil Beaton archive at magazine publishing house Cond\u00e9 Nast in London, followed by art school in Exeter. Being given the boot by Avedon during a year in New York didn\u2019t derail his career, in fact the opposite: aged 25, back in the UK, he received his first commission for Vogue (a relationship that continues to this day). Walker soon became the go-to for high-concept fashion shoots, often in collaboration with the set designer Shona Heath.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cate Blanchett skiing on the moon, Comme des Garc\u0327ons & Julien d\u2019Ys, Paris, 2015. Photograph: Tim Walker/Tim Walker Studio\n\nA turning-point, though, came in 2009 when Walker was asked by Vogue to photograph the designer Alexander McQueen. Walker was on a roll before the shoot: the previous year, he\u2019d staged his first major solo exhibition at the Design Museum, and he had recently been honoured with an Infinity Award from the International Centre of Photography in New York. For McQueen, he sourced a skull and asked the set designer Andy Hillman to make a bow tie out of bones that McQueen would wear.\n\nThe problem was that McQueen didn\u2019t want to wear the bow tie and he didn\u2019t want to put the skull on his head, as Walker envisioned. There was an awkward impasse. But then McQueen popped a cigarette in the mouth of the skull, now perched on the table in front of him. He lit another for himself. The portrait would become one of Walker\u2019s most famous, and an iconic image of McQueen, who killed himself the following year.\n\n\u201cMcQueen taking control of that sitting taught me the importance of the subject owning their photograph,\u201d says Walker now. \u201cSo I am very into all creative people who I work with, whether it\u2019s Fredrik Tj\u00e6randsen or McQueen, I want them to own and enjoy and exist within their photograph.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kate Moss, Chanel boxes and a Coca- Cola, Chanel Haute Couture, The Ritz, Paris, 2012. Photograph: Tim Walker/Tim Walker Studio\n\nWalker insists that inspiration for his unhinged dreamscapes comes from \u201cthe same place it does for you and everyone\u201d. He goes on, \u201cI look at television, I read, I look at National Geographic, at newspapers, at documentary photography, at fashion photography, at cinema, at Fassbender\u2019s films, I look at Merchant Ivory films\u2026 Anything that any one of us has seen \u2013 high, low, mid \u2013 and then I mix it all up.\u201d\n\nHis best ideas come when he is daydreaming: cycling through Victoria Park, near where he lives, swimming in the Olympic pool in Stratford, walking the dog. A few years ago Walker photographed the director David Lynch, who explained his weirdest thoughts came after he had been doing transcendental meditation. \u201cIt was a state that sends up so much creativity for him,\u201d says Walker. \u201cSo I learned how to meditate transcendentally.\u201d He breaks into a broad grin, flashing a gold tooth, \u201cAnd it didn\u2019t really give me a lot!\u201d\n\nWalker was approached by the V&A back in 2016 about doing an exhibition that looked back at his career in the fashion industry, but also included new, specially commissioned work. It was a huge honour for the photographer, but perhaps an equally outsized gamble for the museum.\n\n\u201cIt is rare for the V&A to give an exhibition of this scale to a photographer so young,\u201d admitted Susanna Brown, the V&A\u2019s curator of photography, at the launch in March. \u201cBut I feel he has achieved so much over the last 25 years. His work speaks to so many people.\u201d The invitation came at a perfect time for Walker. The commissions from magazines and brands have never stopped rolling in, but he was finding himself disenchanted with the fashion world. There are some exceptions \u2013 the Vogue editor Edward Enninful, for example, is a friend and Walker credits him with \u201cde-stagnating\u201d what we think of model beauty \u2013 but the industry was leaving him cold. \u201cIt\u2019s isolated figures making a lot of money and creating very banal work,\u201d he says. \u201cArtistry is at a premium.\u201d\n\nAlongside a more conventional retrospective of 100 or so images in a white room, the V&A asked Walker to explore their archives, which contain some 2.3m objects spanning 5,000 years of human creativity, and select 10 items that excited him. He would then make new photographic projects based around each of those. \u201cI spent a year opening boxes and speaking with each archivist at the V&A,\u201d says Walker. The objects he picked include a manuscript made for the Duchess of Brittany in the 1470s, illustrations by Aubrey Beardsley and a dress from McQueen\u2019s 2009 Horn of Plenty collection. The photographs, alongside the objects that inspired them, will be displayed in room sets created by Shona Heath \u2013 think a burned-out cathedral or an opulent country house \u2013 so you will feel like you have stumbled into one of Walker\u2019s photographs.\n\n\u201cThe best thing about the V&A project is that it\u2019s a never-ending resource of inspiration,\u201d says Walker. \u201cAnd coming at that point in my life, it was like a feast! It\u2019s like when you suddenly discover a new restaurant and you\u2019re tasting flavours you\u2019ve never tasted before.\u201d Walker needs to go back to his shoot with the balloon dresses. After today, three years of work on the V&A show will be complete. As for what happens next, he\u2019s not sure. As much as Avedon remains a touchstone, Walker is less interested in emulating his ferocious work ethic. He has a newish boyfriend and he likes being one step removed from the fashion world. \u201cI feel sorry for Dick,\u201d says Walker. \u201cHe was brilliant, but I don\u2019t know how much fun he had. Working with him was very, very hard, like being in the army. Every time he photographed, it was like going into war. Whereas I\u2019m trying to have a nourishing life and also hopefully make some memorable photographs. But if it doesn\u2019t happen, it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that magazines are shuttering at an alarming rate. \u201cIt\u2019s undeniably the death of print media and where does that leave culture?\u201d he says. \u201cI grew up wanting to see photographs that I make on the printed page, so it\u2019s quite an interesting time to stop and take stock and decide where I could go next.\u201d Does that mean Walker might stop taking photographs then? \u201cI just need six months off,\u201d he replies, gnomically. \u201cAnd when I say time out, not really, because I\u2019m going to be reading, watching, looking.\u201d He smiles, \u201cI\u2019ll still be the same old voyeur.\u201d\n\nTim Walker: Wonderful Things is on at the V&A from 21 September to 8 March 2020.
