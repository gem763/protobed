But the trip has garnered attention not for the memorial, but because Abraham accidentally called September 11th \u201c7-Eleven.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of the video, the reality star says, \u201cOkay, so we wanted to do, since it\u2019s gonna be September 11, in honor of the Freedom Towers, and observatory deck and everything, of 7-Eleven, we are going to do this. Wow, look at this guys.\u201d\n\nAbraham brushed right past her mistake to say how important she believes it to be that her daughter learn about the tragedy.\n\n\u201cI think this is gorgeous, beautiful, and in memory of a lot of loved ones, a lot of others lost,\u201d she goes on. \u201cI remember being in fifth grade when September 11 attacks happened, Sophia was not born yet, so I think it\u2019s really important that Sophia learns about it, and here we go.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty gorgeous here. It\u2019s such a great day. The buildings are so beautiful,\u201d she added.\n\nRELATED: Farrah Abraham Has Wardrobe Malfunction as She Goes Commando on Venice Film Festival Red Carpet\n\n\u201cI kind of wanted to make this video while I\u2019m here at the Freedom Tower for September 11,\u201d she continued. \u201cHowever we all deal with loss, I encourage you guys to check out my last videos for bereavement, depression, but it\u2019s good to have a memorial for those. It\u2019s great to visit loved ones and have good memories.\u201d\n\nView photos Farrah Abraham and her daughter | Johnny Nunez/WireImage More\n\nFor an Instagram video with clips of the longer YouTube video, Abraham wrote in the caption, \u201cIn memory of September 11th , I was in 5th grade when this happened & now Sophia being in 5th grade we enjoy this experience watch now link in bio FarrahTube.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Couple Who Met Because of 9/11 Open Up About Their Love Story\n\nInstagram users were quick to point out the mistake, and several found the slip disrespectful.\n\n\u201cIts 9/11 not 711.. has the botox leaked into your brain,\u201d one commenter wrote.\n\n\u201ctake this down !!! So many mistakes and insensitivity\u201d another added.\n\n\u201cUnfollowing right now. The fact that she said 7-11 is disgusting. She is using this horrible moment in history to try to gain more fame and exploit her child even more. So shameful,\u201d another disappointed follower said.\n\nAmidst the negative comments, Abraham added her own: \u201c\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc.\u201d", "description": "Farrah Abraham Calls 9/11 '7-Eleven' in Tribute Video with Daughter", "authors": ["Ashley Boucher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hrU6kwvRQE8sT_F1hyXEEg--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/447d9c9ae783e8d6e4d3faedc3000111", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
