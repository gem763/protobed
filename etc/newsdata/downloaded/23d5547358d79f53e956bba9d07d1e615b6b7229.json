That\u2019s because tariffs are taxes, and American businesses and consumers are paying higher taxes every day.\n\nThe latest increase of tariffs came on Sept. 1. Two more increases are scheduled for later this year, on Oct. 15 and Dec. 15.\n\nThe passionate supporters of tariffs argue that the aim should be not just to change China, but to encourage Americans to stop doing business in China altogether. They suggest that American businesses can simply find alternative suppliers in countries like Vietnam or Mexico.\n\nHowever, the reality isn\u2019t as simple as moving pieces on a chessboard. The numbers reflect what businesses already know: that you can\u2019t just pack up and move production on command.\n\nSince the Trump administration began placing tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods coming from China, it has also granted hundreds of exemptions from these tariffs for Americans who can\u2019t find alternative suppliers outside of China.\n\nThe White House claims the tariffs have been an immense cost to the Chinese economy and are being paid for by China, but roughly $20 billion worth of products are exempt from these taxes because they would be too costly for American businesses to go without.\n\nJust a few months ago, the Trump administration announced tariffs for a separate $300 billion worth of goods coming from China. But shortly after, the tax on half this amount was delayed out of fear of cutting into Christmas shopping.\n\nSpecific products like pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals inputs, select medical goods, rare earth materials and critical minerals were exempt from tariffs altogether.\n\nOf course, there are those that aren\u2019t exempt from the tariffs. And because they aren\u2019t able to find alternative suppliers outside of China either, they\u2019re stuck paying the price \u2013 more than $20 billion in additional taxes over the last year.\n\nOverall, trade between the two nations has declined but not enough to displace China as one of the U.S.\u2019s top trading partners. U.S. goods imports from China are down 12 percent from last year, and exports are down 18 percent. But the U.S. and China are looking to do $570 billion worth of trade in 2019, compared to the $660 billion worth of trade in 2018.\n\nIf there\u2019s a silver lining to all of this U.S.-China trade turbulence it\u2019s that it\u2019s unlikely to cause a U.S. or Chinese recession. That\u2019s because total trade with China makes up only 3.6 percent of U.S. GDP; trade with the U.S. makes up only 5.4 percent of China\u2019s GDP.\n\nIt bears noting, however, that business with China isn\u2019t just about trade, it also includes investment.\n\nRecent reports suggest U.S. business investment in China isn\u2019t slowing, despite the tariffs. In fact, investment in China is growing. U.S. businesses have already invested $6.8 billion in China this year, up 1.5 percent from a year ago.\n\nMore than 80 percent of the American businesses that actually operate in China say they have no plans to move out of China. They also have no plans to reduce their investments in China.\n\nHistorically, the U.S. is the second-largest investor in China, with direct investment totaling $117 billion.\n\nAs much as some would like to see the U.S. \u201cwin\u201d a trade war, or Americans and Chinese stop doing business with each other, the numbers suggest that\u2019s not happening.\n\nUntil President Trump gets what he wants, nothing is certain but more trade uncertainty.", "description": "If the last two years have taught us anything, it\u2019s that\u00a0trade wars\u00a0are neither good nor easy to win.\n\nSupporters of the Trump administration\u2019s tariff tactics continue to assure us that China will ultimately change its\u00a0bad behaviors, and at little cost to the U.S. Now, however, weaker economic data is coming not just from China but from the U.S. as well.", "authors": ["Riley Walters", "Policy Analyst", "Asia Economy", "Riley Walters Is Policy Analyst", "Technology In The Heritage Foundation S Asian Studies Center."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-09/GettyImages-1021648148.jpg?itok=_FHF_XRi", "published_at": "2019-09-02"}
