These Are the Best.", "language": "en", "text": "Growing up, the best thing about Disney shows was that they were on during that window after the bus dropped you off, but before your parents got home from work. The amount of math homework that was staved off because of Boy Meets World must be incredible. Kim Possible was basically just an outlet for Christy Carlson Romano super fans who needed more of her beyond Even Stevens. That\u2019s So Raven taught Disney kids that clairvoyant meant being able to see into the future and was not just Black Widow\u2019s real name (Claire Voyant).\n\nOn November 12, Disney+ will drop 7,500 episodes of TV, which means there will be plenty of time to escape stressful family talk (or maybe even math homework? We don't know your life) with thousands of hours of old Disney shows. Remember a time when your shows were your shows? When your parents didn\u2019t also binge the same things and want to have an in-depth discussion about Stranger Things? DuckTales belonged to you.\n\nPretend that you\u2019re still living in those glorious after-school hours and kick back with all the shows that kids these days have never gotten the privilege of experiencing\u2014or God forbid\u2014even know exist. Remember the original lessons that came along with them: the first and most important being that heroes and heroines always have friends who help them get out of trouble or generally know better. Disney taught us that it\u2019s sometimes better to be the sidekick than to be the main character; aim a little lower for a better life.\n\nAdult Disney fans, it's time. Go and learn new lessons.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Qmcl2VRHaaqISgAIHqWZJQ--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/esquire_269/ed6bc4f5bbd6a5b4e6b3c68aad05d870", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
