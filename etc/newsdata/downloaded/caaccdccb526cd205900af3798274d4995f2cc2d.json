PCG, +22.07% soared for second day on Wednesday, in the wake of some reports of progress in containing the Kincade fire that has ravaged California's Sonoma County. The shares rose 19% in afternoon trading, to pace the NYSE's gainers. On Tuesday, the stock had blasted 32.4% higher, after plunging 53.7% in three days to close Monday at a record low given concerns the company may have helped start the Kincade fire. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said as of Wednesday morning, 76,825 acres and 30% of the Kincade fire was contained.
