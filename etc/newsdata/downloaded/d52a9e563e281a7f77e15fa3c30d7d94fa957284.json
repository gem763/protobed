This announcement is the first step and Singh said the party would have more details over the coming weeks.\n\nThe number of gang-related homicides in Canada has increased over the past four years, from 82 in 2014 up to 157 in 2018, according to Statistics Canada.\n\nSeveral major cities in the country have seen a spike in shootings and gang-related violence in the same time period.\n\nThe Liberal government created a minister for organized crime reduction in July 2018, charged with working to reduce gun violence and aiding the fight against organized crime. Bill Blair now fills that role.\n\nThe Conservatives have also proposed measures to address gangs in Canada.\n\nSingh also hosted a town hall on youth violence Sunday night in B.C. It was Singh's sixth straight day campaigning in the province, where he is running for re-election in the Vancouver-area riding of Burnaby South.", "description": "Leader Jagmeet Singh committed to invest $100 million over five years to fund after-school programs, sports and drop-in centres for youth across the country in an effort to keep them from joining gangs.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5302043.1569776209!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-ndp-20190929.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
