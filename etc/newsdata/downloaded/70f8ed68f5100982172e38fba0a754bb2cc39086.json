Billy won a scholarship to Harrow before signing his first contract at 20.\n\nA fascinating school photo shows a nine-year-old Billy Vunipola as a budding rugby star as he poses with boys a year older than him in his under-11s club\n\nAnother photo shows the young player holding aloft a rugby trophy as he dwarfs a fellow teammate in stature.\n\nBilly made his England debut in 2013 and has since won 45 caps. He and his brother are hoping to lead the country to victory against South Africa on Sunday's final.\n\nIt comes after the brothers and their teammates are yet to discover whether they'll face a fine for their V-shaped response to New Zealand's haka during Saturday's Rugby World Cup semi-final.\n\nThe England players fanned out to symbolically out-flank the All Blacks' traditional Maori challenge, with several players spilling over into the New Zealand half of the field.\n\nFrance were fined \u00a32,500 for breaching a 'cultural ritual protocol' after they linked arms and marched towards the haka ahead of the 2011 World Cup final.\n\nAnother photo shows the young player holding aloft a rugby trophy as he dwarfs a fellow teammate in stature\n\nAnd given this precedent, it is expected that England will be sanctioned in a similar way by World Rugby.\n\nThe players revealed afterwards that the v-shape was the idea of their coach Eddie Jones, with Mako Vunipola admitting afterwards that 'we knew it would rile them up.'\n\nCaptain Farrell was pictured smirking while the dance was performed, with New Zealand scrum-half Aaron Smith saying afterwards that Farrell winked at him.\n\nBilly made his England debut in 2013 and has since won 45 caps.

'He thought he was supposed to go all the way around it and go to their 10.\n\n'But because of that, he's the one who has to pay the fine. He dishes it out a lot so the boys would be more than happy if he has to pay it.'\n\nEngland responded to New Zealand's haka on Saturday by standing in a V-formation", "description": "It's plain to see the England\u00a0hero, 26,\u00a0showed  signs of becoming a major athlete at a young age as the star-in-the-making towers over his teammates in the astonishing picture.", "authors": ["Sophie Law For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/01/20307712-0-image-a-55_1572313538159.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
