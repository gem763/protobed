That constitutional crisis has arrived.\n\nThe White House has released an extraordinary letter from White House Counsel Pat Cipollone to congressional Democrats, a document that will live on in infamy from this day forward as evidence of how profoundly Trump corrupted the office of the president and everyone around him.\n\nDespite the fact that it appears under the signature of the chief lawyer of the White House, the letter reads like some combination of a deeply misinformed seventh-grader\u2019s social studies paper and a rant from Sean Hannity, randomly tossing around terms like \u201ccivil liberties\u201d and \u201cseparation of powers\u201d without any apparent understanding of what they mean.\n\nBoiled down to its essence, the letter asserts that Trump is beyond the reach of oversight, of impeachment and of any checks and balances from the legislative branch. Because he thinks Congress is not treating him \u201cfairly\u201d (the word \u201cfair\u201d appears eight times in the letter), Trump has decided that he can issue a blanket refusal to \u201cparticipate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry.\u201d All requests for documents and testimony will be rejected, and all subpoenas will be thrown in the trash.\n\nTo put this in context, there are regular disputes between Congress and the executive branch over particular subpoenas or other ways Congress exercises its oversight power.\n\n\u201cThe executive rarely if ever is willing to give up everything Congress wants on the terms that Congress wants,\u201d Professor Melissa Murray of New York University law school told me. But the usual procedure is that after some negotiation, \u201cthey reach some compromise that\u2019s mutually acceptable. And when they can\u2019t, they will then go to the courts.\u201d\n\nThe White House, however, is not saying that they have legal grounds to refuse some particular request Congress has made. They don\u2019t even make a claim of executive privilege. They say instead that the entire inquiry is unfair, and therefore they can reject all of it.\n\n\u201cIf Congress cannot exercise its power of oversight or its power of impeachment, it essentially means the president doesn\u2019t have to answer to anyone but the political process, which only comes around every four years,\u201d Murray says. \u201cAnd that essentially makes the president a king.\u201d\n\nI also spoke to Elizabeth Wydra, the president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, who agreed. The letter, she said, \u201chas no basis in the Constitution, and its claims to wrap its partisan obstruction in the Constitution are outrageous.\u201d\n\nWydra added that the blanket assertion that the White House will refuse to comply with \u201cthe most important constitutional check on executive misconduct \u2014 the impeachment process \u2014 that\u2019s just unprecedented and extraordinary, and frankly has no place in a properly working constitutional democracy.\u201d\n\nEven Richard Nixon fought with Congress over particular subpoenas, such as for the Oval Office tapes that revealed his guilt, but didn\u2019t claim that he was immune from honoring the entire impeachment process.\n\nThe fact that these claims are being made by the White House counsel, who is supposed to be the lawyer for the presidency, demonstrates how everyone around Trump is implicated in his corruption.\n\nThe letter\u2019s repeated assertions that the House is violating Trump\u2019s \u201ccivil liberties\u201d and \u201cdue process\u201d rights are laughable, because the Constitution says nothing about the particular processes by which the House has to carry out impeachment. The House can establish any rules it wants.\n\nFurthermore, the privileges the letter demands, such as the president being able to cross-examine witnesses, are a matter for the trial phase of impeachment, which happens in the Senate. If Trump wants all that, he should take it up with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nCipollone and the lawyers who work for him know this full well, which is what makes the letter so preposterous. This letter, Wydra told me, \u201cdishonors both the presidency and the White House Counsel\u2019s Office. And frankly, as a lawyer, especially as a constitutional lawyer, I find it repugnant to our duty to the law.\u201d\n\nSo will Republicans be standing up to the White House in the face of this outrageous assault on the very idea of checks and balances? You remember, the ones who cried \u201cTyranny!\u201d whenever Barack Obama signed an executive order, the ones who shouted \u201cStonewalling!\u201d if the Obama administration resisted a single document request from Congress, the ones who intoned about the Constitution and the rule of law with such seriousness when they demanded Bill Clinton\u2019s removal from office?\n\nIf they wanted, they could say that they don\u2019t think Trump should be impeached and hope that if he is he\u2019ll be acquitted by the Senate, but nonetheless they insist that of course he has to respect the powers Congress is granted by the Constitution, because they believe in that Constitution and the system it created.\n\nThey won\u2019t say that. Some won\u2019t say it because they\u2019re cowards, afraid of backlash from Trump himself and his most rabid supporters. Some won\u2019t say it because they don\u2019t actually believe in the Constitution if it isn\u2019t delivering the outcomes they prefer.\n\nWhatever the source of their silence \u2014 or worse, their despicable defenses of all of Trump\u2019s misdeeds \u2014 the result is the same. They\u2019re just as corrupted as the White House lawyers who wrote that shameful letter. And they\u2019re helping Trump drag our entire democratic system down.\n\nRead more:\n\nPaul Waldman: Putin helped Trump in 2016.
