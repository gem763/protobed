Suffice it to say, Hell hath no fury like a president, especially this president, disappointed yet again.\u201d\n\nCavuto said he understood the president\u2019s concern, but also noted that economies in some of the countries lowering their rates \u201caren\u2019t exactly firing on all cylinders\u201d and aren\u2019t necessarily something the U.S. should emulate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy issue is the economy already is strong, or certainly strong enough that the Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t have to be doing this,\u201d he said.\n\nDavid Asman, co-anchor \u201cBulls & Bears,\u201d said it\u2019s unlikely that Trump will actually fire Powell as some have suggested and noted that some voting Fed members wanted no interest rate cuts at all.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s worried that with Europe and Japan issues $16 trillion worth of negative interest rate bonds, pour rates have to come down more to make our exports more competitive,\u201d Asman said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a point that the Fed has an important role in maintaining the dollar\u2019s parity against foreign currencies.\u201d\n\nIt was the second interest rate cut in three months, lowering the federal funds rate between 1.75 percent and 2 percent. Officials with the Fed said they made the cut \u201cto keep the economy strong.\u201d\n\nConnell McShane, co-host of \u201cAfter the Bell,\u201d noted that recent data has shown that the economy is hanging in pretty well, despite slowing in certain areas, like manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you could easily make arguments for Powell and company to cut rates and/or leave them as is. It\u2019s also why we see so much disagreement, or diversity, on the committee itself,\u201d McShane said. \u201cHowever, most investors were looking for a cut and we likely would have seen a large stock market sell-off if we didn\u2019t get one.\u201d\n\nCavuto believes the markets seemed \u201cmore confused than relieved\u201d by the news of Wednesday's cut.\n\n\u201cWe swung within a more-than-200-point range before stocks ended the day kind of where they began,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember, confusion isn\u2019t always better, especially when it comes to the Federal Reserve and whether it\u2019s going to cut rates again or not.\u201d\n\nJerome Powell, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, speaks during an event at the University of Zurich in Zurich, Switzerland, on Friday, Sept. 6, 2019. Powell said the most likely outlook for the U.S. and world economy is continued moderate growth, Expand\n\nWhile Powell didn\u2019t say if the Fed will definitely cut rates again, his comments also didn\u2019t sink the market like they have previous times, FOX Business\u2019 Charles Payne, host of \u201cMaking Money,\u201d wanted to remind Fed watchers.\n\n\u201cThe move will keep the economic expansion going, helping consumers and encouraging investments,\u201d Payne said.\n\nAnd the stock market did hang in pretty well, initially selling off but starting to rally when Powell talked about expanding the Fed\u2019s balance sheet sooner rather than later.\n\n\u201cBasically, he\u2019s willing to go back into \u2018money printing mode\u2019 if needed and stocks seemed to like that,\u201d McShane said. \u201cMore than anything, investors were looking for as much clarity as possible on what comes next today. They didn\u2019t really get that. The only thing clear from Powell\u2019s comments and the Fed statement is there is no clarity.\u201d\n\nBut nothing is creating more uncertainty than the trade war, declared McShane. \u201cCertainty is what investors and businesses crave and there\u2019s just no way to get that in this environment,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Payne said, the White House \u201cwill remain furious\u201d as long as Trump can\u2019t get the same response out of the Fed that Chinese President Xi Jinping gets from the People\u2019s Bank of China.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping make joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, November 9, 2017. REUTERS/Damir Sagolj - RC167AEF0C00\n\n\u201cMany market observers agree with Trump's frustration, which is now underscored by the fact the U.S. financial system ran out of dollars this week \u2014 something that wouldn't have happened if the Fed had not taken money out of the system,\u201d Payne said.\n\nIf we do get a slowdown or a recession, it most likely will be brought on by the president\u2019s trade policy, McShane said.\n\n\u201cIt seems obvious he wants someone to blame if that slowdown comes to fruition,\u201d McShane said. \u201cThat someone is Jay Powell.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced a 25-basis point interest rate cut.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/FS_ANCHOR_LINEUP_CAVUTO_MCSHANE_PAYNE_ASMAN.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
