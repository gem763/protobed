REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nEasily rankled when Democrats accuse him of wrongdoing, Trump boiled over on Wednesday at the impeachment inquiry they are pursuing over his July 25 phone call to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nDemocrats want to prove he sought personal political gain by appealing to Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden.\n\nTrump sees the impeachment probe as a harassing follow-up to the Russia investigation that failed to knock him out of office and is frustrated that much of the U.S. news media do not cover what he views as Democratic hypocrisy.\n\nFrom hard-boiled tweets to lashing remarks to reporters in the Oval Office and later in the East Room, Trump\u2019s anger built throughout the day.\n\n\u201cThe Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone\u2019s time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016,\u201d he said in a tweet.\n\nHe was just clearing his throat.\n\nIn the Oval Office, Trump called U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, the Democrat whose House Intelligence Committee is leading the probe, \u201cshifty Schiff.\u201d\n\nTrump said Schiff would not be able to carry the jockstrap of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, calling it a \u201cblank strap\u201d out of deference to his sense of Oval Office decorum.\n\n\u201cAll they want to do is try and win the election in 2020, so they come up with this impeachment nonsense!\u201d Trump said of the Democrats.\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable U.S. ally to meddle in the 2020 election for his own political benefit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more corrupt course of conduct,\u201d Schiff said on Wednesday.\n\nAn innocent bystander to the White House events was visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, who hosted Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin for a summit in Helsinki in July 2018.\n\nA Finnish reporter looking to change the subject told Trump that \u201cFinland is the happiest country in the world,\u201d to which the president replied: \u201cFinland is a happy country.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, for sure,\u201d Niinisto agreed amiably.\n\nAfter the two leaders had a lunch of Dover sole in the Cabinet Room, the stage was set for a joint news conference in the East Room.\n\nIt started out evenly. Trump expressed condolences for a stabbing attack in Finland, and Niinisto talked about European security and melting Arctic sea ice.\n\nBut when the questions turned to impeachment, Trump\u2019s stormy mood gathered force.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump responds to a question about Ukraine and the whistleblower report during a joint news conference with Finland's President Sauli Niinisto at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 2, 2019. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nHis voice rising with anger, Trump lashed reut.rs/2oAAIP0 out at Reuters reporter Jeff Mason, who asked what he had wanted Zelenskiy to do when Trump brought up the business ties to Ukraine of Biden's son Hunter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole hoax, and you know who\u2019s playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country,\u201d he retorted. He told the reporter not to be \u201crude\u201d and repeatedly evaded the question.\n\nThe news conference was supposed to include two questions from the American side and two from the Finnish side. But after the third questioner, Trump had enough, ending the event and walking off stage.", "description": "President Donald Trump is mad as hell.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436439579&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911ZQ"}
