Health and security officials said 183 were injured in the protests, adding that most of the injuries were to the head and chest.\n\nAccording to officials, that raised the national death toll to at least 64 people killed since the demonstrations erupted in the capital and the south\u2019s major cities on Tuesday.\n\nOn Saturday, security remained heavily deployed in Baghdad. Streets and main squares were open to traffic after curfew was lifted at 5 a.m. local time, though access to the Green Zone, the area housing government offices and foreign embassies, was restricted. Municipal workers were clearing the streets of the bullets and debris left behind by the latest confrontations.\n\nAbu Muslim, a taxi driver in Baghdad, praised the lifting of the curfew.\n\n\u201cIt is a good move for the sake of our families. We are now able to go on the streets. I have been on the street since 5 a.m., nothing is going on today,\u201d he said.\n\nParliament is to convene for an emergency session later in the day to discuss protesters\u2019 demands. Both Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi and Parliament Speaker Mohammed al-Halbusi called on protest representatives to meet to hear their demands.\n\nBut with a call from the largest bloc in parliament to boycott the session, it was not clear if a session would take place.\n\nCurfew remained in place in other southern cities, where violence has been deadly and where there are concerns more rallies were organized.\n\nSpontaneous rallies started as mostly young demonstrators took to the streets demanding jobs, improved services like electricity and water, and an end to corruption in the oil-rich country.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to curb the growing rallies, authorities blocked the internet and imposed an around-the-clock curfew in the capital.\n\nBut the protesters, many of whom camped on the streets, continued to turn up in Baghdad and a number of southern cities, including Nasiriyah, Amarah, and Kut.\n\nOn Friday, influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr has called on Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s government to resign and hold early elections, saying in a statement that the shedding of blood of \u201cIraqis cannot be ignored.\u201d Al-Sadr, who controls the largest bloc in parliament, also called on members of his coalition to boycott sessions until the government puts forth a program acceptable to the people.\n\nAbdul-Mahdi said in an address to the nation that the protesters\u2019 \u201clegitimate demands\u201d had been heard, adding that the security measures used against the demonstrations were like \u201cbitter medicine\u201d that needs to be swallowed.", "description": "BAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 Iraq faced the prospect of a deepening political crisis Saturday, after four days of unrest left at least 64 people dead, and authorities", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/05/b96310_iraq-protests-05350-anti-government-protesters-set-fires-close-street-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
