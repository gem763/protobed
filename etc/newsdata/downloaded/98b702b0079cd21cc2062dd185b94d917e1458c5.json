We know those are the rules, so yes,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cYou\u2019d be foolish if you hadn\u2019t prepared for it, but I would be highly surprised if after 80 minutes, then 10 minutes each way (extra time), then sudden-death extra-time \u2026 that someone hasn\u2019t scored some points. But funnier things have happened.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they got the cricket one right really.\u201d\n\nThe New Zealand cricket team won a lot of praise from fans of the game around the world for the way they reacted to the heartbreaking outcome, despite taking more wickets than England in the regulation overs. The International Cricket Council has subsequently scrapped the boundary countback tiebreaker for future tournaments.\n\nAll Rugby World Cup matches to date have been decided within normal or extra-time, but there\u2019s provision for a shootout that would involve five players from each team taking place kicks.\n\nUnder the rules, a coin toss would be made and the winner would decide which team kicks first, or from which end of the field the kicks are taken.\n\nThe five kickers from each team must be on the playing field at the end of the extra, extra-time period to be eligible for the shootout, which would be taken in a sequence from three positions on the quarter-line - in front of goals, and from 15-meters in from the touchline on the left and right sides.\n\nNew Zealand had the best goalkicking percentage in the group stage with 84 percent accuracy, although with 23-man squads the calculations on who takes the kicks could get complicated. Veteran lock Sam Whitelook wasn\u2019t really aware of the rules when he was asked Tuesday, but fellow second-rower Scott Barrett reckoned he would be a good choice if one of the All Blacks forwards was required to step up to the tee.\n\n\u201cDepending on injuries. \u2026 I\u2019m sure there\u2019d be a few backs first,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d have to be quite short (of options). Out of the forwards, I\u2019d definitely back myself, sure.\u201d\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t even be the first option in his family, if a place kicker was needed.\n\nThere were three Barrett brothers in the All Blacks\u2019 23-man squad for the quarterfinal win over Ireland last weekend. Beauden Barrett is usually a flyhalf but is playing fullback for New Zealand, and Jordie Barrett is a utility back. Both are regular goalkickers.\n\nScott and Beauden Barrett are roommates this week - for the first time since 2002, apparently - so if there\u2019s any kicking advice required, it\u2019ll come from close to home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite nice to have a key driver of our game to be rooming with and chat about stuff to prepare for this game,\u201d Scott Barrett said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The inevitable question of the tiebreaker was posed to New Zealand coach Steve Hansen ahead of the Rugby World Cup semifinal against England.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Pye"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
