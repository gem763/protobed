But there's another way to track this development beyond the U.S. Census: follow the music.\n\nAs soon as numbers hit a critical mass in developing communities in the South, Northeast and the Midwest, someone invariably comes along to present concerts, live music in nightclubs and eventually festivals.\n\nSuch is the case with the third annual Los Dells Festival held in central Wisconsin. This year, the two-day festival featured big names like Caf\u00e9 Tacvba and Ozuna as well as indie faves like Salt Cathedral. Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Man\u00e1 have performed in previous years alongside regional acts.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gabriella Cisneros/Radio Milwaukee Gabriella Cisneros/Radio Milwaukee\n\nOur pals at 88Nine Radio Milwaukee spent two days in the bucolic backdrop situated about halfway between Chicago and Minneapolis. New Alt.Latino contributor Kenny Perez hung out backstage and gathered interviews with Caf\u00e9 Tacvba, Salt Cathedral, Ximena Sarina\u00f1a and Natalia Lafourcade.
