Autumn officially begins on September 23 at 3:50 a.m. EDT.\n\nHowever, this year's Harvest Moon is unlike most in that it will coincide with Friday the 13th. This rarity hasn't happened since a full moon appeared on October 13, 2000.\n\nThe next time a full moon will coincide with Friday the 13th will be August 13, 2049.\n\nThe name Harvest Moon has symbolic meaning, NASA explains, because farmers sometimes need to work late into the night by the light of the moon to prepare for the winter ahead.\n\nWhile Friday the 13th is usually considered a day of bad luck, you may be fortunate enough to view the Harvest Moon, especially if you try in the middle of the night. According to NASA, peak viewing time will be a little after midnight \u2014 on Saturday, September 14 at 12:33 a.m. EDT.", "description": "Lucky us \u2013 the rare occurrence hasn't happened in 19 years", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2008/10/16/57abb682-a642-11e2-a3f0-029118418759/thumbnail/1200x630g2/f01b946b534395027a0781bf883e5df4/image4526178.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
