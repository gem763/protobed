Mandatory Credit: Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Packers had won all four previous visits to AT&T Stadium \u2014 including Super Bowl XLV \u2014 led in three of the four by quarterback Aaron Rodgers, but it was the team\u2019s other Aaron that carried the load. Jones had 19 carries for 107 yards and added team-leading figures of seven receptions for 75 yards as the Packers (4-1) won without star receiver Davante Adams.\n\nJones\u2019 fourth touchdown gave Green Bay a 31-3 lead with 3:30 left in the third quarter, but Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott then took over the game. Despite facing a strong pass rush, he threw a 40-yard touchdown pass to Michael Gallup and a 53-yard touchdown pass to Amari Cooper, with the latter cutting the margin to 34-24 with 7:46 remaining in the game.\n\nDallas pushed into the red zone on its next possession, but the drive bogged down, and kicker Brett Maher missed a 33-yard field goal wide right to seal Dallas\u2019 second consecutive loss following a 3-0 start.\n\nRavens 26, Steelers 23 (OT)\n\nBaltimore\u2019s Marlon Humphrey caused and recovered a JuJu Smith-Schuster fumble, setting up Justin Tucker\u2019s 46-yard field goal in overtime as the Ravens won in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe game was marred by a concussion to Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph, who was knocked unconscious at 7:26 of the third quarter. He was replaced by Devlin Hodges, who was 7 of 9 for 68 yards in his NFL debut.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s Lamar Jackson was 19 of 28 for 161 yards with one touchdown. He was intercepted three times and sacked five times by Pittsburgh (1-4). Mark Ingram II ran for a touchdown for the Ravens (3-2), who lost safety Tony Jefferson in the fourth quarter to a torn ACL.\n\nPanthers 34, Jaguars 27\n\nChristian McCaffrey ran for 176 yards and scored three touchdowns and Carolina won its third straight game by holding off Jacksonville in Charlotte, N.C.\n\nAfter McCaffrey limped off the field with about five minutes left, backup Reggie Bonnafon broke off a 59-yard touchdown run to put the Panthers (3-2) ahead by seven with 3:34 to play.\n\nDJ Chark caught eight passes for 164 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Jaguars (2-3), who drove to the Carolina 24 in the waning seconds before ending the game with an incomplete pass by Gardner Minshew II.\n\nBills 14, Titans 7\n\nJosh Allen\u2019s 7-yard touchdown pass to Duke Williams in the fourth quarter lifted Buffalo to victory against Tennessee in a defensive battle in Nashville, Tenn.\n\nAllen, who took a hit to the head from New England\u2019s Jonathan Jones last week, had been in concussion protocol until Saturday morning. He finished 23 of 32 for 219 yards, two TDs and one interception for the Bills (4-1).\n\nAllen found Williams in the end zone to give Buffalo a 14-7 advantage with 9:46 left in the fourth. The six-play, 77-yard drive was highlighted by Isaiah McKenzie\u2019s 46-yard reception.\n\nRaiders 24, Bears 21\n\nOakland used a fake punt in their own territory to set up Josh Jacobs\u2019 go-ahead touchdown with 1:57 remaining in a 24-21 triumph over Chicago at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.\n\nJacobs rushed for 123 yards and scored twice for the Raiders (3-2), who have responded with consecutive wins after back-to-back losses.\n\nTarik Cohen had a 71-yard punt return to set up a go-ahead touchdown in the third quarter for the Bears (3-2), who rallied from a 17-0 deficit with a 21-point blitz in the third period.\n\nTexans 53, Falcons 32\n\nDeshaun Watson passed for a career-high 426 yards and five touchdowns and Will Fuller tied a franchise record with 14 catches for a career-high 217 yards and three TDs as host Houston stormed past Atlanta.\n\nThe Texans (3-2) amassed a season-high 592 yards and did not allow a sack of Watson, who entered the game having been sacked 18 times, the third-highest total in the league.\n\nThe slumping Falcons (1-4) led 17-16 at halftime but lost momentum in the third quarter, punting on all three of their possessions while surrendering 222 yards as Houston scored 17 unanswered points.\n\nSaints 31, Buccaneers 24\n\nTeddy Bridgewater passed for 314 yards and four touchdowns as New Orleans defeated visiting Tampa Bay, improving to 3-0 since he replaced injured Drew Brees in the starting lineup.\n\nBridgewater completed 26 of 34 passes and had his highest yardage total of the season for the Saints (4-1). Michael Thomas caught two of the touchdown passes and finished with 11 catches for 182 yards. Jared Cook and Ted Ginn Jr. caught one touchdown each.\n\nThe Buccaneers (2-3), who set a franchise record for points in a 55-40 victory over the Los Angeles Rams a week earlier, finished with 252 total yards. Jameis Winston completed 15 of 27 passes for 204 yards and was sacked six times.\n\nEagles 31, Jets 6\n\nNathan Gerry and Orlando Scandrick each scored touchdowns on defense for host Philadelphia, which cruised to a 31-6 win over reeling New York.\n\nThe Eagles (3-2) have won two straight. The Jets, who were without starting quarterback Sam Darnold (mononucleosis) for the third straight game, are 0-4 for the first time since 2003.\n\nLuke Falk, the third quarterback to start this season for the Jets, struggled mightily against the Eagles, who entered Sunday with just five takeaways and three sacks this season. But Philadelphia forced three turnovers and collected 10 sacks, including three by Brandon Graham and two by Scandrick.\n\nPatriots 33, Redskins 7\n\nTom Brady passed for 348 yards to move into third place on the NFL\u2019s all-time leaderboard as unbeaten New England methodically defeated winless Washington in Landover, Md.\n\nBrady surpassed Brett Favre (71,838) on a 15-yard toss to Julian Edelman with 6:56 left in the third quarter. He finished with 71,923 to creep within 17 yards of second-place Peyton Manning (71,940).\n\nBrady completed 28 of 42 passes with three touchdowns and one interception and recorded his 90th career 300-yard effort for the Patriots (5-0). An early 65-yard touchdown run by Steven Sims Jr. was the only highlight for the Redskins (0-5), off to their worst start since 2001.\n\nCardinals 26, Bengals 23\n\nRookie quarterback Kyler Murray\u2019s late scamper set up Zane Gonzalez\u2019s 31-yard field goal as time expired, lifting Arizona to its first victory of the season at Cincinnati.\n\nMurray, who rushed for a 6-yard touchdown in the first quarter, used his feet again to rush 24 yards up the middle on the final drive for the Cardinals (1-3-1), who were playing their first game since the death of owner Bill Bidwill. He passed away at the age of 88 on Wednesday.\n\nMurray rushed for a team-leading 93 yards, and Chase Edmonds added a 37-yard touchdown run as Arizona was able to present Kliff Kingsbury with his first win as a coach while preventing Cincinnati (0-5) from doing the same for Zac Taylor.\n\nBroncos 20, Chargers 13\n\nPhillip Lindsay rushed for 114 yards and a touchdown as Denver upset Los Angeles in Carson, Calif., presenting Vic Fangio with his first win as an NFL coach.\n\nThe Broncos (1-4) led 17-0 at halftime and did just enough to hold off the Chargers (2-3) after the break. Denver\u2019s only points in the second half came on Brandon McManus\u2019 46-yard field goal with 1:55 left, providing a 20-10 lead.\n\nRookie kicker Chase McLaughlin drew Los Angeles within seven points on a 32-yard field goal with 10 seconds left, but Denver recovered the ensuing onside kick to seal the outcome.\n\nVikings 28, Giants 10\n\nKirk Cousins, Dalvin Cook and Adam Thielen had monster games and Minnesota became the first team to quiet Daniel Jones-mania, defeating New York Giants in East Rutherford, N.J.\n\nCousins completed 22 of 27 passes for 306 yards and two scores, both to Thielen (130 yards), and Cook had 218 total yards to snap the Vikings\u2019 five-game losing streak in outdoor stadiums.\n\nIt was the first loss for Jones, who had engineered a two-game winning streak since taking over for Eli Manning. The rookie finished with just 182 yards on 21-of-38 passing with a touchdown and a late interception for the Giants (2-3) against the Vikings (3-2).\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Aaron Jones tied a franchise record with four touchdown runs, and the Green Bay Packers held off a furious comeback to beat the Dallas Cowboys 34-24 on Sunday in Arlington, Texas.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437892053&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF96014-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
