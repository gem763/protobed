TXN, +1.77% and Xilinx Inc. XLNX, +1.91%, which were less optimistic.\n\nCowen analyst Matthew Ramsay, who has an outperform rating and a $40 price target, said there\u2019s been a lot of \u201cnoise\u201d since AMD\u2019s last earnings report with the company\u2019s Aug. 7 release of its \u201cRome\u201d chip, which got picked up by Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOG, +0.33% GOOGL, +0.41% Google Cloud Platform.\n\n\u201cCombined with announced partners Amazon AMZN, -1.09%, Microsoft MSFT, +0.56%, Baidu BIDU, +0.17% and Tencent 700, -0.75%, we believe this has the potential to allow AMD to quickly capture x86 server share against Intel\u2019s roadmap that may need Sapphire Rapids in 2021 to get fully back on track,\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cSapphire Rapids\u201d is the code name for either Intel\u2019s new refinement of its 10-nanometer process or its new 7-nanometer process.\n\nIn chip parlance, nanometers, or nm, refers to the size of the transistors that go on a computer chip, with the general rule being that smaller transistors are faster and more efficient in using power. Rome uses a 7-nm process, while Intel has struggled to bring its 10-nm process chip to the market.\n\n\u201cWe believe 7nm Rome has the technical merits to offer a superior TCO in many server workloads,\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cAlong with socket compatibility with Naples, a consistent roadmap, and deep customer engagements, we believe this has renewed AMD as a viable second source to Intel in a market that has been starved for competition.\u201d\n\nRead: Intel suggests the chip recovery is here, even as rivals are still waiting\n\nEarnings: Of the 32 analysts surveyed by FactSet, AMD on average is expected to post adjusted earnings of 18 cents a share, down from the 22 cents a share expected at the beginning of the quarter. Estimize, a software platform that uses crowdsourcing from hedge-fund executives, brokerages, buy-side analysts and others, calls for earnings of 19 cents a share.\n\nRevenue: Wall Street expects revenue of $1.81 billion from AMD, according to 31 analysts polled by FactSet. That\u2019s down from the $1.94 billion forecast at the beginning of the quarter, but up from the $1.65 billion reported in the year-ago period. Estimize expects revenue of $1.83 billion.\n\nStock movement: AMD shares have declined 3.4% since the company\u2019s last earnings report, rebounding from a big drop following its outlook. In comparison, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.41% has gained 0.3%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.70% has declined 0.4%, and the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, +2.05% has gained 3.5% in that time.\n\nWhat analysts are saying: Of the 38 analysts who cover AMD, 14 have buy or overweight ratings, 21 have hold ratings and three have sell or underweight ratings, with an average price target of $33.01, nearly 1% above Friday\u2019s close.\n\nWells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers, who has an outperform rating and a $40 price target, said he\u2019s bullish on the stock ahead of earnings, most notably to the company\u2019s thoughts on Intel\u2019s chip price cuts.\n\nGiven Intel\u2019s \u201ccompetitive reaction\u201d to AMD\u2019s Rome release, Rakers asked \u201cWhy would AMD not have to react to the 50%+ list price reductions by Intel?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile AMD\u2019s EPYC Rome deployments at hyperscale / cloud customers are a key focus, we continue to think the company\u2019s expanding list of supercomputing / HPC wins should be considered a very positive competitive validation,\u201d Rakers said.", "description": "Advanced Micro Devices Inc. this week gets to showcase how its new smaller-architecture chip impacted its business, hot on the heels of a positive earnings...", "authors": ["Wallace Witkowski"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP005_amd080_ZG_20190807195713.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
