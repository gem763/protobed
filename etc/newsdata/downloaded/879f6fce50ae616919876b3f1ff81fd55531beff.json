The former tech executive has emphasized that UBI is a necessity because globalization and automation will continue to devastate manufacturing and low- income jobs from Americans.\n\nProponents of UBI, like Yang, say that granting a guaranteed income will reduce poverty and economic inequality. If there is a guaranteed income, Yang argues, people will have the resources to afford basic necessities if they are looking for work, caring for elderly or ill family relatives, going to school or trying to start a business.\n\nOpponents, however, argue that a guaranteed income for everyone would be too costly and would deprive the poor of targeted support. The National Bureau of Economic Research estimated in a February report that paying for UBI would cost more than $3 trillion annually, which is more than three-fourths of the federal budget.\n\nIf UBI is implemented under Yang\u2019s proposal, some economists argue that poverty and inequality will be exacerbated because money for government assistance programs, like food stamps and housing vouchers, will instead be converted to payments to people across the economic spectrum, meaning less money for programs that target poor Americans.\n\nOn his campaign website, Yang has proposed \u201cconsolidating some welfare programs\u201d to pay for his Freedom Dividend, and that\u2019s worrisome to people like Robert Reich, who served as Labor secretary during the Clinton administration.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI'm supportive of a universal basic subsistence income that keeps Americans out of poverty,\u201d Reich, who's now\n\na professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley,\n\nsaid in an email. \u201cBut, I worry about Yang's proposal in two respects. First, Yang would get rid of public assistance for people who accepted the $1,000 per month cash benefit -- meaning that no one would be better off than they are now.\u201d\n\nThere are some exceptions, though. Social Security benefits would still be available, regardless of whether people accept the $1,000 a month.\n\nReich and Pugh both said UBI should supplement rather than replace social welfare programs.\n\nYang's campaign responded by saying recipients of social benefits would not lose them under the Freedom Dividend.\n\n\u201cAnyone would be free to keep their current benefits and the Freedom Dividend stacks on top of SSI, Medicare/Medicaid, as well as housing supplements,\u201d campaign spokesman S.Y. Lee said in an email. \u201cThe Freedom Dividend is meant to be an alternative to means-tested welfare programs, most of which amount to less than $1000 a month. These programs often provide a disincentive to work or volunteer, and force people to spend time interacting with an unwieldy bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nStill, Yang's website says: \"Current welfare and social program beneficiaries would be given a choice between their current benefits or $1,000 cash unconditionally \u2013 most would prefer cash with no restriction.\"\n\nYang has also proposed a 10 percent value added tax (VAT) to help pay for his Freedom Dividend. A VAT, which is the value added to a product in the supply chain, is added to the sales price when it reaches the retailer.\n\nPugh and Reich argued that a VAT would hurt consumers, especially low-income Americans.\n\n\u201cBecause the Freedom Dividend is funded through a regressive Value Added Tax, costs will rise for low-income Americans, leaving some of the most vulnerable Americans worse off than before,\u201d Pugh said.\n\nReich added that the poor would pay a higher percentage of their income under a VAT. Instead, Reich argued, UBI should be \u201cfinanced through a wealth tax.\u201d\n\nYang's campaign argued that a VAT at 10 percent forces massive tech companies like Amazon and Google to pay more in taxes, and consumers will not see a dramatic increase in prices for basic necessities like food.\n\nLuxury goods, however, will be subject to \u201chigher rates\u201d Lee said.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget published an article in June that challenged Yang\u2019s claim that a VAT would cover a sizable portion of the bill for his guaranteed income proposal. In its analysis, the group determined that a 10 percent VAT would generate an estimated $600 billion in annual revenue, which would cover about one-fifth of the total cost of the Freedom Dividend.\n\nThe Brookings Institution in August published a paper co-authored by Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who argued that proposals like Yang\u2019s would do very little to \u201creduce inequality of advance opportunity and social mobility.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Kearney argued that the Freedom Dividend is a \u201cpoorly designed tool to reduce poverty and inequality in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if we really were serious about reducing poverty and income inequality in America,\u201d Kearney said. \u201cWe would devote a lot more resources to increasing the income and living standards of those in the bottom of the income distribution.\"\n\nYang has championed the idea that UBI will encourage people to find work, increase entrepreneurship, help people make smarter decisions, and improve labor market efficiency.\n\nAnd he has some prominent supporters in his camp.\n\n\u201cA Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month, for the first time in history, would put every citizen above the government established poverty level,\u201d said Andy Stern, President of Emeritus of SEIU and Senior Fellow at The Economic Security Project. \u201cIt would provide economic stimulus for local communities and raise the Income floor for Americans.\u201d\n\nKearney, however, said that she has found \u201cno compelling evidence that leads me to believe that giving people money will generally lead to any appreciable increase in work or successful business creation.\u201d", "description": "Advocates of universal basic income (UBI) are cautioning against Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang\u2019s proposed \u201c", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/yangandrew_091919gn10_lead_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
