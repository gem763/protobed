(TropicalTidbits.com)\n\nDespite firmly being on the downslope of traditional hurricane season, the Atlantic is showing signs of life again, with a trio of disturbances marching across the basin; one of them is likely to become a named storm, while another could bring rain to portions of the Gulf Coast and Florida later this week.\n\nMeanwhile, a pair of tropical waves in the Pacific are catching eyes. One of these two could enhance or trigger bouts of heavy rainfall in West Texas on Monday into Tuesday.\n\nArea to watch may produce heavy rainfall along Gulf Coast\n\nA strong tropical wave is chugging along over central Honduras. It will bring heavy rain to Belize and parts of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, which will spur the risk of dangerous mudslides \u2014 especially in the higher terrain. By Thursday or Friday, the system will emerge toward the Bay of Campeche, where it will encounter waters running about 3\u00bd degrees warmer than normal.\n\nWhile that disturbance is unlikely to consolidate enough to develop further, it\u2019s marked by a pool of deep tropical moisture that will be drawn north toward the Gulf Coast in the Thursday through Saturday time frame.\n\nEarly indications suggest a highly saturated atmosphere will overspread the Interstate 10 corridor from central Louisiana through the Florida Panhandle by Sunday. The moisture could then get drawn farther north along the Eastern Seaboard early next week, though uncertainty reigns this far out.\n\n\n\nA plume of moisture from a system over the Bay of Campeche may facilitate the blossoming of heavy downpours late week along the Gulf Coast. (Weatherbell.com)\n\nThe next Atlantic storm: Nestor?\n\nThe most impressive tropical wave in the Atlantic is one just off the coast of Senegal. The National Hurricane Center gives it an 80 percent chance to develop. Conditions are \u201cconducive for a tropical depression to form within the next day or two,\u201d according to the center, which would put Cabo Verde in line for gusty winds and heavy downpours toward midweek.\n\nIf this system manages to inch up to tropical storm strength, it would be given the name Nestor. The name \u201cMelissa\u201d was used for a subtropical storm that developed within a nor\u2019easter off the New England coast last week; Melissa\u2019s disheveled remnants remain out to sea.\n\n\n\n(National Hurricane Center)\n\nRegardless of how the disturbance evolves, its window for growth is limited; strengthening upper-level winds should disrupt the system\u2019s circulation by midweek, capping its intensity at whatever it achieves by late Tuesday or early Wednesday.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve seen a summer of systems spin up off the African coast in the Atlantic\u2019s \u201cmain development region,\u201d seeing one potentially gel there this time of year is unusual. Ordinarily, the threat shifts to more homegrown systems \u2014 including from the Gulf of Mexico and the western Atlantic waters adjacent to the Gulf Stream \u2014 by the time autumn rolls around.\n\nPhilip Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State, pointed out on Twitter that no named storm had ever formed east of 37 degrees west longitude this late in the year. If our first system does indeed elicit a name, it could set a new territorial record for mid-October.\n\nAnother system in this main development region is approaching the Windward Islands, but isn\u2019t long for this world. The National Hurricane Center gives it just a 20 percent chance of development, with the system exhibiting a ragged, disorganized look on satellite. By Wednesday, upper-level winds will become \u201cquite hostile\u201d for development, according to the center.\n\nIn the Pacific\n\nJust like in the Atlantic, a plume of tropical moisture in the Pacific is set to get slingshot north. The culprit is a disturbance near the tip of Baja California. By Monday afternoon and evening, shower and thunderstorm activity is predicted over the Texas Big Bend and Trans-Pecos. Extreme southern and southeastern New Mexico may also be affected.\n\n\n\nSatellite imagery shows moisture streaming north ahead of a disturbance near Baja California. (TropicalTidbits.com)\n\nThe National Weather Service in El Paso noted \u201csatellite images showing very abundant moisture to the south associated with tropical disturbance over the southern Gulf of California.\u201d Models indicate a half to three-quarters of an inch is probably beneath many of the downpours, with isolated inch-and-a-half totals. This may not seem impressive, but consider that El Paso averages only 9.71 inches year round. It also doesn\u2019t take much to spur flash flood concerns in the sandy soil, especially in dried-up river beds and arroyos.\n\nAn additional system west of the shores of Nicaragua has an 80 percent chance of development. While western Mexico will have to watch this one, the system poses no threat to the United States.", "description": "Moisture from a Pacific system may reach west Texas, while a second system could enhance rain along the Gulf Coast late this week.", "authors": ["Matthew Cappucci", "Meteorologist", "Capital Weather Gang", "October At Am", "Matthew Cappucci Is A Meteorologist For Capital Weather Gang.
