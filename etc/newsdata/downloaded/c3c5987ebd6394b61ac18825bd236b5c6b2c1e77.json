More than 11 groups want to disrupt the city every day until Friday to protest about a mining conference\n\nVictoria Police will deploy more than 300 officers each day to keep everyone safe\n\nViolent far-left group Antifa, which claimed responsibility for a physical attack on conservative journalist Andrew Bolt in 2017, has also joined the blockade.\n\nPolice said they were deploying more than 300 police per day to keep everyone safe until the conference ends on Thursday.\n\nVictoria Police spokesman Tim Tully warned protesters on Monday to keep it peaceful.\n\n'We're there to facilitate a safe and peaceful protest and we can work with you in achieving that,' he said.\n\nViolent far-left group Antifa has joined the protest calling on 'comrades' to 'get on it'. More than 11 groups have joined the Blockade IMARC Alliance. Protest groups are trying to use media coverage to promote their event\n\n'However ... If we see that it is unlawful or causing disruption to the community and puts their safety in danger, we will act and we will act swiftly.'\n\nActing Commander Tully said police had reached out to the Blockade IMARC Alliance protesters to work with them, but they had not responded.\n\n'It is frustrating, the lack of engagement that we've had,' he told reporters on Monday.\n\nNo naked rallies such as this one from Melbourne, October 12, are known to have been planned\n\nPolice expect Blockade IMARC to disrupt inner Melbourne in a similar manner to the Extinction Rebellion protests earlier this month where protesters used lock-on tactics to block roads and thoroughfares.\n\nDisruptions are expected for traffic, pedestrians and public transport in the South Wharf area with a flow-on effect felt in the CBD.\n\nA mass blockade has been planned for Clarendon Street on Tuesday morning, the main day of protest, while Greens Senator Adam Bandt will address the blockade on Wednesday.\n\nBlockade IMARC said on social media that it wants to use non-violent civil disobedience tactics, and was delighted to get media coverage in the Herald Sun, calling it 'advertising'.\n\nPolice expect some of the same tactics used by Extinction Rebellion earlier this month to block CBD streets such as lock-ons, swarms or protesters gluing themselves to the ground\n\nAt a planning meeting on Sunday, protest organisers said they would try to get into the conference, block entrances to the centre and use decoy groups to confuse police, the Herald Sun reported.\n\n'We want to make life hell,' said one protester.\n\nProtest groups posted media coverage of the planned protest to social media on Monday in an effort to promote their action.\n\nMore than 7000 mining industry leaders, policy makers and investors from 100 countries are expected to attend the conference, IMARC says on its website.\n\nConference organisers warned attendees to come early as registration and security would take at least 45 minutes for each person to counter the threat, with mandatory bag searches.\n\n'We have worked very hard with the venue, local police and our security team to ensure we minimise disruption to your arrival at the event and your safety throughout your attendance,' organisers said on the IMARC website.\n\nProtesters march in Melbourne on Monday against Australia's biggest mining conference", "description": "About 30 activists with signs gathered outside the International Mining and Resources Conference (IMARC), at the Melbourne Convention Centre, on Monday morning.", "authors": ["Alison Bevege For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/02/20265010-0-image-a-33_1572231467588.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
