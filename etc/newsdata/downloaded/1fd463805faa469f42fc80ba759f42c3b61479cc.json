With an aim to build up a better and friendlier digital assets ecosystem, Bithumb Global is launching new tools to help create inclusive community resources and a new \u201cUnleash\u201d program which strives to bring awareness to their vision.\n\nFounded in 2014, Bithumb Korea is the earliest and most influential digital currency exchange in South Korea. With 8 million registered users, 1M mobile app users and a current cumulative transaction volume has exceeded 1 trillion US dollars, Bithumb is one of the market leaders in digital asset trading with a loyal community. Bithumb also facilitates 59.19% of the entire Korean Bitcoin transaction volume and accounts for approximately 15% of the global market. The highest daily transaction volume for the Korean exchange has reached over 7B USD.\n\nEven with these successes, Bithumb has only been mainly focused on the South Korea region with over 80% of its platform users originating from there. Due to this, Bithumb launched its spinout, Bithumb Global, earlier this year to connect liquidity and market potential to the rest of the world.\n\nWith Bithumb Global operating as an independent entity equipped with its own internal resources, the spinout is able to provide a better crypto trading experience and create the new standard which the community will come to expect. With improved technology such as advanced order matching engines, coin staking features, and many unrevealed product offerings, Bithumb Global is the next-generation digital asset exchange which serves the global audience.\n\n\u201cSince Bithumb Global\u2019s beta launch in May of 2019, it has on-boarded more than one million users worldwide, and have had their daily trading volume exceeded over $381 million,\u201d says Javier Sim, Co-Founder and Managing Director of Bithumb Global. \u201cIt has become the only exchange established in 2019 that was ranked among the top trading platforms in the world.\u201d\n\nOne of the most unique features of Bithumb Global is their \u201cBG Staging\u201d initiative. With BG Staging, pre-selected projects are able to reach Bithumb Global\u2019s community and drive attention. Unlike IEOs (Initial Exchange Offering) and other exchange fundraising activities, BG Staging does not require users to invest fiat or currency in a fundraising round, rather they stake their digital assets to show their interest and receive back their stake plus potentially a voucher for the featured project\u2019s tokens after a lock-up period.\n\nBithumb Global has also implemented tighter security measures, a low latency order matching engine with proprietary technology and advanced algorithms, and a friendlier user interface.\n\nFor those interested in joining the BG Community, please find more information at Bithumb Global.\n\nAbout Bithumb Global\n\nBithumb Global is a decentralized digital asset trading platform providing world-class cryptocurrency trading services to users worldwide. Derived from Bithumb, one of the most popular cryptocurrency trading platforms in South Korea, BG enables each global user to trade, participate or contribute in the digital assets ecosystem.
