He said this jet-powered type will be revelled soon.\n\n\u201cThese drones ... carried four precise bombs per strike,\u201d Saria said.\n\nOther drones were also \u201cused to confuse the enemy so the main planes could reach their targets,\u201d he said.", "description": "Yemen's Houthi group said on Wednesday it had identified dozens of sites in the United Arab Emirates as possible targets, in an attempt to underscore its military clout following a weekend attack it claims to have carried out on Saudi oil facilities.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431360833&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1VO", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
