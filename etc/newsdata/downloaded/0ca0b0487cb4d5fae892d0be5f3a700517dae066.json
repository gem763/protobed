yesterday jailed for 18 months at Leeds Crown Court.\n\nProsecuting, Mr Dunn told the court how Hargreaves sent the messages to the BBC anonymously via an online complaints form.\n\nThe BBC was made aware of the messages by a member of staff from Capita, the organisation which handles complaints on behalf of the corporation.\n\nMr Dunn said common features of the messages included a preoccupation with Formula 1 racing and the use of 'grossly offensive racist language.'\n\nHargreaves' complaints included claims that Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton 'should not be described as an Englishman.'\n\nThe defendant also accused the BBC of being a 'left-wing organisation.'\n\nMr Dunn said: 'He threatened to act on those complaints by threatening to shoot a BBC

troubling'.\n\nMr Dunn added: 'It was at the forefront of his mind and he felt exposed when travelling to and from work.'\n\nHargreaves also sent a similar threatening message to the London Evening

arrested for posting a menu with 'racist words' written on it through the letterbox of an Indian restaurant.\n\nDescribing the content of the messages, Judge Rodney Jameson, QC, said: 'They were not only grossly offensive in the sense of expressing, in the crudest imaginable terms, racist views, but they were specifically designed to create anxiety.'\n\nHargreaves was also ordered to sign the sex offender register for seven years.\n\nMr Myrie is a news journalist and presenter who works for BBC News as London World Affairs Correspondent and as presenter of BBC Weekend News.\n\nMr Nicholls is a
