Island authorities hope to achieve UNESCO Biosphere Reserve status. Yet still, the natural environment is under threat from an insatiable assailant.\n\nGoats outnumber human inhabitants 15-fold and they are munching stretches of Samothraki into a moonscape. After decades of trying to find a solution, experts and locals are working together to find a 21st century way to save the island\u2019s ecology and economy.\n\nSemi-wild, the goats roam across the island, which is about three times the size of Manhattan, and can be spotted on rooftops, in trees or on top of cars as they scour the landscape for anything to eat. Their unchecked overgrazing is causing crisis-level erosion.", "description": "", "authors": ["Latimes.Com World-Nation Story Tens-Of-Thousands-Of-Goats-Munch-Greek-Island-Into-Crisis"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
