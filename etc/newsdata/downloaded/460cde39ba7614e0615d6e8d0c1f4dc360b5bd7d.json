External factors driving this change include regulatory support of regtech solutions, and consultancies offering more help to FIs wanting to sift through solutions. Startups offering regtech solutions will also play a part by partnering with each other, forming industry organizations, and taking advantage of new opportunities.\n\nThe Regtech Revisited report from Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, provides a brief overview of the current global financial regulatory compliance landscape, and the regtech industry's position within it. It then details the major drivers that will shift the dial on FIs' adoption of regtech over the next 12-18 months, as well as those that will propel startups offering regtech solutions to new heights. Finally, it outlines what impact these drivers will have, and gives insight into what the global regtech industry will look like by 2020.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways:\n\nRegulatory compliance is still a significant issue faced by global FIs. In 2018 alone, EU regulations MiFID II and PSD2 have come into effect, bringing with them huge handbooks and gigantic reporting requirements.\n\nRegtech startups boast solutions that can ease FIs' compliance burden \u2014 but they are struggling to scale.\n\nSome changes expected to drive greater adoption of these solutions in the next 12 to 18 months are: the ongoing evolution of startups' business models, increasing numbers of partnerships, regulators' promotion of regtech, changing attitudes to the segment among FIs, and consultancies helping to facilitate adoption.\n\nFIs will actively be using solutions from regtech startups by 2020, and startups will be collaborating in an organized fashion with each other and with FIs. Global regulators will have adopted regtech themselves, while continuing to act as advocates for the industry.\n\nIn full, the report:\n\nReviews the major changes expected to hit the regtech segment in the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nExamines the drivers behind these changes, and how the proliferation of regtech will improve compliance for FIs.\n\nProvides our view on what the future of the regtech industry looks like through 2020.\n\nInterested in getting the full report?
