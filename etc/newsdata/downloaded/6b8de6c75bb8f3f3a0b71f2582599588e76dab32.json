Wilder\u2019s got to fight Ortiz, so we\u2019ll see how that fight goes and then make a decision on whether it\u2019s going to be in February or not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If he loses, it\u2019s definitely not going to be in February is it? It\u2019s not going to happen at all. He\u2019s going to have a rematch with Ortiz. So then we\u2019ll have to look for a new opponent for February 22. Either or, I\u2019ll be fighting on February 22.\n\n\u2018Whatever happens in other people\u2019s lives and careers, it\u2019s none of my concern, but my life and career I\u2019ll be boxing February 22 in Las Vegas that\u2019s for sure. Whether the cut is okay or not, I\u2019ll still be fighting February 22 because that\u2019s what I do!\u2019\n\nIn a further interview with IFL TV, Fury expanded: \u2018What happens if Wilder gets [knocked out]? Everyone is overlooking Ortiz like he\u2019s a bum. Wow! Although the guy is 50 years old he\u2019s still dangerous for four rounds.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t go to sleep on Luis Ortiz, because he\u2019s a monster. He\u2019s definitely a bad old man, that\u2019s for sure. And he\u2019s dangerous in four rounds. In four or five rounds he\u2019s as good if not more dangerous than anyone in the world. So don\u2019t go to sleep on him.\n\nBig-hitting heavyweights Wilder and Ortiz will face off for the second time in November (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018If you overlook him, you\u2019ll go to sleep just like AJ did. So don\u2019t concentrate on me, concentrate on what Deontay Wilder is going to do. Leave me wrestling alone. If I get injured, I get injured. But he\u2019s more likely to get injured than me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The thing is, it\u2019s not me that\u2019s going to get pulled out, or because I don\u2019t want to fight in February, it will be because he\u2019s had a tough fight. \u201cOh I can\u2019t go in February because I\u2019m injured\u201d or he\u2019s been beat or whatever.\u2019\n\nProbed on whether he thinks that would happen, he added: \u2018Is it not possible? It\u2019s heavyweight boxing isn\u2019t it?
