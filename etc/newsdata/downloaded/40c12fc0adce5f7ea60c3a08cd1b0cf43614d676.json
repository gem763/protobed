But that advantage has disappeared amid the growing momentum and war chests of two neighboring state rivals, and now, as the official filing date for the primary kicked off on Wednesday, his early backers are blaming different parts of the campaign\u2019s structure for hampering his ability to stay on top.\n\nSome Biden backers in New Hampshire believe the problems are at the national level, where they see a visible lack of direction that has trickled down to the early states for some time now. Others dismiss that dynamic as natural friction between any state and national teams, and say the greater issue is a communication breakdown happening on the ground.\n\n\u201cWe just need to know who we\u2019re supposed to be talking to on a regular basis,\u201d Peter Sullivan, a Democratic former state legislator, told The Daily Beast.\n\nThat critique was echoed in interviews with multiple Democrats who are publicly supporting Biden, including some who have worked on his previous presidential campaigns, as well as those who have longstanding ties to state politics.\n\n\u201cCommunication has been a problem. We\u2019re all busy but we all need direction,\u201d one longtime veteran of New Hampshire politics who endorsed Biden, said, expressing frustration about several aspects of the campaign.\n\nThe supporter added, \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been a lot of activity that I\u2019ve been involved in. That\u2019s their choice. They can use me as they like. But obviously, you want to do more.\u201d\n\nSupporters of rival candidates tend to promote their crowd sizes as markers of success, and New Hampshire is no different. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have both attracted throngs of people to their recent events. But supporters of Biden contend that while he doesn\u2019t generate the same massive crowds, he\u2019s better than both of the progressive senators at retail politics, and that his personal connection with people helps in the wooing process.\n\nHowever, a recent survey shows that style only gets Biden so far. In a University of New Hampshire poll released on Tuesday, Biden\u2019s support reached its lowest point in the primary in the state, dropping from 24 percent in July to 15 percent. Rocketing past him were Sanders, with 21 percent, and Warren with 18 percent.\n\nAndy Smith, a professor at UNH who conducted the poll, told The Daily Beast that it shows the limitations of name recognition and the campaign\u2019s \u201celectability\u201d argument.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re electable until people don\u2019t think you are,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be extremely difficult and he\u2019s going to have to have a fairly significant shakeup in the campaign to get things going.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the fundraising issue. The release of his third quarter totals revealed Biden\u2019s campaign was more cash strapped than other top-tier contenders. He raised $15.2 million over three months, ending with just $9 million on hand, compared to Sanders, who raised raised $25.3 million, Warren, who raised $24.6 million, and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who brought in $19.1 million during the same time frame.\n\nThat problem, one longtime surrogate said, rests solely with the national campaign.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the problem is as much in New Hampshire as it is in the upper echelon [of the campaign],\u201d a longtime Biden surrogate in the state said. \u201cThey have to adjust more, they have to be more flexible, and more cognizant of New Hampshire politics and what their staff is going through and how difficult it is.\u201d\n\nA Biden New Hampshire campaign official pointed to 10 offices and 50 staff on the ground, adding that they engage early backers by sending weekly updates, holding regular conference calls, and asking them to meet with organizing staff to provide advice. In addition, the official said the team regularly connects supporters with national staff.\n\n\u201cI feel a lot of empathy for the campaign workers because this time there are so many undecided voters,\u201d former Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, a top Biden backer, told The Daily Beast.\n\nSullivan, who also acknowledged the work of the organizers on the ground, said sometimes his concerns would be better handled by a political staffer. \u201cMost of my direct communication has come from the field staff,\u201d he said. \u201cBut sometimes I\u2019ll have things I need to talk about and that\u2019s not the appropriate point of contact.\u201d\n\nNed Helms, a veteran Democratic activist and former state official, said any concerns he has about the campaign are largely based on the nature of the competitive primary, and the increased spotlight on Biden in the 24/7 news cycle.\n\n\u201cDo I have concerns? Sure I do, because I know it\u2019s going to be a close campaign,\u201d Helms said. \u201cThere\u2019s always more to be done but the ground game is on target.\u201d\n\nAnd some prominent supporters say Biden\u2019s efforts in the Granite State are going just fine.\n\nFormer Gov. John Lynch, the state\u2019s longest serving governor who endorsed Biden just hours after he launched his bid, said their campaign has done a \u201cgreat job at communicating,\u201d adding that he receives direction from both the national and state directors.\n\n\u201cI probably get 10 or 15 emails a day saying exactly where the vice president is,\u201d Lynch told The Daily Beast.\n\nStill, some of Biden\u2019s top backers say they want to be more involved and intend to go directly to top campaign officials for guidance.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the whole thing is to replace the person who\u2019s in the White House right now,\u201d said Chris Spirou, a veteran of New Hampshire politics who\u2019s held elected positions in the state. \u201cI plan to talk to people in the campaign and see that we get everybody to pull their weight.\u201d", "description": "\u201cYou\u2019re electable until people don\u2019t think you are,\u201d Andy Smith, a professor at the University of New Hampshire, said.", "authors": ["Hanna Trudo"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572480059/191030-trudo-biden2-tease_atdr9z", "published_at": "2019-10-31"}
