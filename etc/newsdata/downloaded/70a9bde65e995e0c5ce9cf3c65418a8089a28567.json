No wonder people are outraged at the grotesque unfairness of our tax system.\u201d\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAnd Labour MP and tax campaigner Margaret Hodge said the bill was \u201coutrageous\u201d.\n\nFacebook , founded in the US by Mark Zuckerberg, expanded here in 2008 and its main UK-registered business has had total turnover of \u00a34.2billion.\n\nLast year\u2019s \u00a31.6billion was up \u00a3300million on 2017 and of that, some \u00a3800million came from advertising \u2013 up 50%.\n\nThe remainder came from \u201csales support, marketing and engineering support\u201d for other group entities.\n\nFacebook UK started off with a \u00a3439,884 profit in 2008 \u2013 9% of its turnover \u2013 and paid \u00a3147,884 tax. But it had losses of almost \u00a3109million from 2011 to 2015.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAccounts from Companies House reveal profits rose from \u00a362.8million to \u00a396.6million last year. But it has only made a \u00a3219million profit in a decade \u2013 or 5% of turnover. Once losses are offset, it is 2.6%.\n\nProfessor Richard Murphy, a tax expert from City, University of London, said: \u201cWe need all large companies to declare precisely what tax they pay on their profits in each country.\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll know what\u2019s paid and they will have to explain their tricks, or stop doing them.\u201d\n\nThe Tax Justice Network\u2019s Alex Cobham added: \u201cIf Facebook had declared UK profits on sales at the same rate it does globally, it would have paid another \u00a3100million in tax.\u201d\n\nSteve Hatch, Facebook\u2019s vice president for Northern Europe, said: \u201cRevenue from customers supported by our UK teams is now recorded here so any taxable profit is subject to UK corporation tax.\u201d", "description": "Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said the social media giant's bill is an example of \"the grotesque unfairness of our tax system\u201d", "authors": ["Graham Hiscott", "Alex Clarke", "Image", "Reuters", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20563319.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_FILE-PHOTO-Facebook-CEO-Mark-Zuckerberg-makes-his-keynote-speech-during-Facebook-Incs-annual-F8-de.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
