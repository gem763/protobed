Given the tepid flow of donations coming his way, there wasn\u2019t much to sort through but there were still a few surprises. One of them, uncovered by the New York Post, was the revelation that Hizzoner had hired his son Dante for a couple of months to act as a policy analyst. Of course, he wasn\u2019t in the race long enough for any of this to add up to a ton of money.\n\nDante de Blasio, the mayor\u2019s son who graduated from Yale University in May, earned $650 a week from Aug. 1 through Sept. 16 as a policy analyst for his father\u2019s presidential campaign, according to Federal Election Commission disclosures filed late Tuesday. His salary was just $175 a week less than the campaign\u2019s South Carolina political director, Breanna Spaulding. Dante\u2019s Yale pal, Ashtan Towles, also worked for the campaign at the same time as the mayor\u2019s son, earning an equivalent salary. Most of the campaign\u2019s $1 million in expenses from July through September were related to the mayor\u2019s travel to early-primary states.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much of a bombshell this actually is. Sure, it\u2019s technically nepotism, but it wasn\u2019t for a government job. It was just a campaign staff position. And while I\u2019m sure there were tons of more qualified and experienced candidates available, Dante did at least graduate from Yale so it\u2019s not as if he might not have had the chops for the job. (And frankly, de Blasio was never within smelling distance of the nomination so did it really matter?)\n\nHiring his friend from college falls pretty much into the same category. $650 a week isn\u2019t a bad salary at all for that sort of position, but it\u2019s also not exorbitant to the point of calling it an abuse of donor money I suppose.\n\nOf far more interest is the series of very real campaign finance scandals following de Blasio around back home in New York. There are currently several people sitting in jail for dodgy manipulation of campaign cash related to the Mayor\u2019s previous runs. Heck\u2026 there are two people behind bars who pled guilty to bribing de Blasio, though prosecutors somehow never managed to get around to wondering if he might be guilty of something also.\n\nWhen looked at in that light it\u2019s not surprising that the press corps would want to sift through his presidential campaign finances. But if a job for his son and a college buddy are all they come up with, he ran a much tighter ship than he did in his mayoral campaigns.", "description": "All in the family", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DeBlasio.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
