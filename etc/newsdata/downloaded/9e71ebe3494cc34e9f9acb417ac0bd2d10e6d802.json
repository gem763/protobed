If Republicans ever did this they would be excoriated by the Fake News,\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. \u201cLet the facts come out from the charade of people, most of whom I do not know, they are interviewing for 9 hours each, not selective leaks.\u201d\n\nTrump is dealing with a converging series of bad headlines on different topics.\n\nDemocrats in late September launched an impeachment inquiry, and a steady stream of witnesses have come to Capitol Hill over the past week to deliver damning testimony.\n\nEach witness seems to create a bad headline for Trump. On Tuesday, it was Fiona Hill, the senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs who said former national security adviser John Bolton John BoltonBolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Ex-top Trump Russia aide to testify about 'shadow policy' on Ukraine: report Bolton to write memoir on time serving under Trump: report MORE described Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiBolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report Ex-Trump aide on Russia testifies for 10 hours as part of impeachment inquiry MORE as a \u201chand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has seen two of his associates \u2014 both photographed in the past with Trump \u2014 arrested on campaign finance charges related to Ukraine. There have also been reports that Giuliani could be the subject of a criminal investigation in the Southern District of New York.\n\nOn Monday, the White House faced questions about a violent video shared at a conservative gathering over the weekend that depicted Trump gunning down media organizations and prominent liberals. The White House denounced the video, but Trump has yet to say anything about it.\n\nAnd Trump has come under intense criticism over his Syria maneuverings from lawmakers in his own party, who represent his lines of defense on impeachment.\n\nRepublican strategists and former Trump advisers doubt that Republicans will break with Trump on impeachment because of differences over Syria, no matter how angry they are.\n\n\u201cPrivately, it's yet another example of where congressional Republicans find themselves at extreme odds with the administration,\u201d said Republican strategist Doug Heye.\n\n\u201cBut publicly is another matter. Yes, they can be critical of the decisions Trump made on this, even loudly, but while so many of them privately would like to see Trump go, they are not willing to say so publicly,\u201d Heye said.\n\nHe added that GOP lawmakers are likely to stick with Trump unless something really changes in the polls.\n\n\u201cWe've started to see some loss in Republican support in the polls, but it\u2019s not clear if this is a trend or not,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil that's clear, we likely won't see any real change \u2014 just more hand-wringing on policy of the candidate they still support.\u201d\n\nTrump has taken the lead on fighting impeachment, firing off tweets critical of Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiPelosi says Trump sanctions package on Turkey 'falls very short' Graham throws support behind Trump's Turkey sanctions Feehery: Trump may be down, but he's not out yet MORE (D-Calif.) and other key Democrats and using his rallies and other public appearances to unload on an unfair \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nWhite House aides have made scant television appearances to bolster Trump\u2019s defense, and some former administration officials said they were privately waiting to see how testimony with House lawmakers played out in assessing the political landscape ahead.\n\nSome Republicans have gripes with the White House strategy on impeachment, saying the administration should bring on more communicators to work on messaging.\n\n\u201cRight now, public opinion is moving against him,\u201d said GOP strategist Ford O\u2019Connell, who argued that Trump has been smart in branding the impeachment inquiry unfair but that he would eventually need to hand over the reins to someone else to carry through the message.\n\nO\u2019Connell said he thinks Trump can shift public opinion, though he suggests it will be a challenge.\n\nWhite House allies like Sen.
