UK will maintain (the) highest standards of workers' rights and environmental standards when we leave the EU,\" business minister Andrea Leadsom said on Twitter in reply to the FT report.\n\nHowever Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the FT report showed members of parliament would be unwise to trust government promises on workers' rights.\n\n\"These documents confirm our worst fears. Boris Johnson's Brexit is a blueprint for a deregulated economy, which will see vital rights and protections torn up,\" he said.\n\nJunior business minister Kwasi Kwarteng said it was not in the government's interest to seek to loosen employment rules.\n\n\"I think this is completely mad, actually,\" he said when asked about the FT report by the BBC. \"Nineteen Labour MPs have come with us and voted for a second reading (of Brexit legislation). It would not make any sense at all to dilute workers' rights.\"\n\nUnder the Brexit deal negotiated by Johnson's predecessor Theresa May - which parliament rejected three times - the United Kingdom as a whole would have been bound by some \"level playing field\" commitments as part of a customs agreement.\n\nAccording to Johnson's deal, only Northern Ireland will be obliged to continue to follow rules similar to those in the EU, and the rest of the UK can diverge if it is willing to accept greater barriers to trade with the EU.\n\nMost economists think preserving trade ties with the EU should be a priority after Brexit, and see few obvious gains from significantly different regulation.
