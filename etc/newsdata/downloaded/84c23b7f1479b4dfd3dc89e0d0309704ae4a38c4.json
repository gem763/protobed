Though no crashes or incidents have yet been attributed to the cracked pickle forks, the consequences would be dire should the mechanism fail mid-flight\n\nHowever, Southwest Airlines confirmed Tuesday that two of its 737 NGs have been grounded following the probe after both were found to have suffered cracking.\n\nIn a statement to KOMO, a spokesperson for the airline said: \u2018During our inspections of the high-cycle NGs, we did not find abnormalities on the vast majority of our inspected fleet but did identify signs of cracking on two aircraft.\n\n\u2018Southwest removed the aircraft from our operation and reported the findings to Boeing and the FAA.\u2019\n\nThe airline added that both of the troublesome 737 NGs will remain out of service until the issue is fully resolved and understood, with no return to service for the aircraft scheduled.\n\n\u2018Safety is always our uncompromising priority, and our Technical Operations Team is now focused on completing inspections on the remaining portion of the NG fleet covered by the AD,\u2019 the company added.\n\nModels of the 737 NG include 737-700, 737-800, and the 737-900. American Airlines, United, and Delta are all listed as other operators of the model on Boeing\u2019s website.\n\nIn a statement to DailyMail.com, American Airlines said none of it's 737 NGs have been impacted by the FAA's investigation.\n\n'We continue to work closely with the FAA and Boeing regarding the new inspection requirements for our 737-800 fleet,' a spokesperson said.\n\nDelta and United Airlines have not yet responded to a request for comment.\n\nSouthwest Airlines, confirmed Tuesday that two of its 737 NGs have been grounded after cracks were found in the critical component following the probe. The airline added that both of the troublesome 737 NGs will remain out of service until the issue is full resolved and understood, with no return to service for the aircraft scheduled\n\nIssues with the pickle fork were first discovered on a passenger plane being converted into a cargo jet for Amazon Prime.\n\nThe cracks were found to have formed in the outer chord of the rear pickle forks and the behind lying safety straps, just where they pass from the rear spar of the center wingbox to the fuselage side of the aircraft.\n\nThe pickle fork, named so because of its resemblance to the kitchen utensil, is a component that helps attach a plane\u2019s fuselage to its wing structure, managing the stress, torque and aerodynamic forces that bend the connection between the wings and the body of the jet.\n\nEngineers designed the forks to last the lifetime of the plane - more than 90,000 take-offs and landings \u2013 without sustaining any wear and tear.\n\nBut though no crashes or incidents have yet been attributed to the cracked pickle forks, the consequences would be dire should the mechanism fail mid-flight.\n\nIn a statement to DailyMail.com, Boeing spokesperson Paul Bergman ensured 'safety and quality' remain the companies 'top priorities'.\n\n'Boeing notified the FAA of this issue and has been actively engaged with our 737NG customers globally in a plan to support the required inspections. Boeing has provided all 737NG customers detailed instructions for conducting the inspections and reporting the results,' Bergman said.\n\n'Boeing regrets the impact this issue is having on our 737NG customers worldwide and we are working around the clock to provide the support needed to return all airplanes to service as soon as possible.'\n\nBergman added that Boeing is setting up a repair plan and will be providing customers parts and technical support as necessary.\n\nThe FAA\u2019s discovery comes as the latest blow to Boeing who were forced to ground its entire global fleet of the the 737 NGs successor, the 737 Max aircraft, in March, following two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that left 346 dead.\n\nLast week, pilot-union leaders at Southwest Airlines suggested it could be February or March for the company resumes flights using the 737 Max, which has led to cancellation of around 30,000 flights since the grounding was ordered.\n\nBoeing had initially suggested the 737 Max would take the skies again in late 2019, but suffered a number of set-backs attempting to fix a software issue said to have played a key role in the two crashes.\n\nThe FAA\u2019s discovery comes as the latest blow to Boeing who were forced to ground its entire global fleet of the the 737 NGs successor, the 737 Max aircraft (above), in March, following two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that left 346 dead\n\nAmerican Airlines followed Southwest\u2019s lead Wednesday, announcing it too was pushing back its return of the 737 Max until early next year.\n\nThe airline said it expects to slowly bring the plane back into its schedule starting January 16 - six weeks later than American planned just last month, and the sixth time the airline has pushed back the plane's return.\n\nOfficials of the Fort Worth-based company says it will drop about 140 flights per day until mid-January because of the grounding.\n\nAmerican has 24 Max jets in storage and expected to have 40 by the end of the year.\n\nThe setbacks add to a dogged year for Boeing, whose successive scandals have tarnished their public standing and caused share prices to plummet.\n\nBut the manufacturer\u2019s losses may increase still, after Southwest Airlines pilots launched a lawsuit against them earlier this week, seeking $100 million in compensation for 10,000 pilots who claim to have lost wages because of the 737 Max\u2019s grounding.\n\n\u2018As pilots, there is nothing more important to us than the safety of our passengers,\u2019 Capt. Jonathan Weaks, president of Southwest Airlines (LUV) pilots association, said in a news release. \u2018We have to be able to trust Boeing to truthfully disclose the information we need to safely operate our aircraft. In the case of the 737 MAX, that absolutely did not happen.\u2019\n\nIn response, a company spokesperson told Barrons the company believed the \u2018lawsuit is meritless and will vigorously defend against it.\u2019\n\nSouthwest\u2019s pilots aren\u2019t said to be the only group aggrieved by Boeing, with investors also being hurt by the scandal.\n\nAirlines that operate the 737 Maxs have seen their share prices under perform in the past seven months when compared with airlines that don\u2019t operate the troublesome jet.\n\nMost Wall Street analysts expect the stock market to react positively when the 737 Max takes to the skies again. After that initial jump however, its predicted shares will trade in a tight range while the public \u2013 and pilots \u2013 wait for a substantial period of safe operation.\n\nAfter the initial drop from $422 a share following the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March, Boeing shares have traded roughly in a $50 range and are down about 12 percent.", "description": "Cracks were found in a vital reinforcing component known as the 'pickle fork' - which attaches the wings to the plane's fuselage - in three of the jetliners last week, which prompted an emergency FAA probe.", "authors": ["Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/16/19498920-0-image-a-21_1570635876478.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
