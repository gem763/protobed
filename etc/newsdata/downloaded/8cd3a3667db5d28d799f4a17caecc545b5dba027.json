The product was sent to distribution centers in Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Virginia, and then to Taco Bell restaurants in 21 states across the eastern Midwest, northern Southeast and Northeast regions, Taco Bell said.\n\nTaco Bell restaurants in some states reportedly were suggesting chicken or steak to customers as a beef substitute before the recall was publicly announced, prompting some to call out the company on social media.\n\n\"The secrecy of what's going on makes me afraid to ever eat at your restaurant again,\" one Twitter user wrote.\n\nHey @tacobell can you guys be real about what\u2019s going on with your beef.
