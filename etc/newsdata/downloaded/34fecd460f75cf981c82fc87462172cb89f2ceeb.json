The Atlanta rapper, born Jeffery Lamar Williams, has been a growing force in hip-hop for the better part of a decade. His instantly recognisable alto has been slithering and crawling its way up the charts for almost a decade, but the last 24 months have seen Thug rise to become the sun king at the centre of rap\u2019s solar system.\n\nIn 2019, Young Thug became his own genre. He won his first Grammy for backing vocals and ad-libs on Childish Gambino\u2019s This is America. Thug's last album So Much Fun debuted at number one in the United States, a commercial culmination that displayed the artist\u2019s musical contrasts in all their glory. It\u2019s his answer to Lil Wayne\u2019s career-defining Tha Carter III, a smartly-constructed distillation of his appeal \u2013 more coronation than a classic \u2013 diluting his berserk experimentation in favour of a restrained fluorescent joy that could appeal to suburban teens discovering vape pens and rap for the first time.\n\nAs well as topping the album chart, he briefly occupied 11 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, including his Post Malone collaboration, Goodbyes, which still receives over a million streams daily. And yet, Thugga's most impressive legacy is his army of imitators; young artists who discovered that there's money and fame to be made from idiosyncratic rhymes and unconventional sounds.\n\nIn the early 2010s Thug emerged from Atlanta, the city that has largely set the tone for hip-hop across this decade. The conventional narrative around Thug\u2019s convention-melting screeches and warbles always considered him far too extraterrestrial, idiosyncratic, and hostile to the promotional demands required to become the chart-topping festival-headlining star that his talent warranted.\n\nYet, the 10th of 11 children from the Jonesboro South projects in Atlanta has become ubiquitous on the Spotify US Top 50, even when he\u2019s not in plain sight. Consider Camilla Cabello, the ex-Fifth Harmony singer \u2013 her biggest solo record is Havana, her 2017 collaboration with Young Thug. Or Drake, the most commercially impactful rapper of the decade, who has repeatedly cribbed Thug\u2019s slippery electric-eel cadences, most notably on last year\u2019s track Mob Ties.\n\nIn rap, influence usually begins regionally and expands outward. So, it\u2019s unsurprising that practically every recent Atlanta artist owes paternity to the rapper briefly known as SEX. Take February\u2019s Three Headed Snake from Gunna, a rapper signed to Young Thug\u2019s label YSL. Last year, Gunna and another Thug prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Lil Baby, broke beyond the Rolling Loud discourse with Drip Too Hard, an unofficial spinoff of Future and Thug\u2019s Drippin on Me.\n\nEven someone as revolutionary as Thugger couldn\u2019t have existed without his acknowledged idol, Lil' Wayne\n\nThe difference between homage, imitation, and apprenticeship may remain forever murky. The old rap line held that no biting was allowed was summed up by Wu Tang Clan\u2019s Raekwon: \u201cI don\u2019t want no one sounding like me on no album.\u201d A more equanimous view came from TS Eliot: \u201cImmature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different.\u201d Even someone as revolutionary as Thugger couldn\u2019t have existed without his acknowledged idol, Lil Wayne, whose slurred codeine hexes splintered rap\u2019s possibilities in a thousand directions.\n\nListening to Thug\u2019s first mixtapes from the beginning of the decade, the dragon-in-couture croak and Jabberwocky rhyme schemes that followed are absent. It\u2019s all muted riffs on Wayne. Even on his first notable project, 2011\u2019s I Came From Nothing 2, he remains in thrall to his hero, though songs like Keep In Touch revealed his limitless potential. Like all of Thug\u2019s best work, the track is resistant to critical rambling. It\u2019s built on puppy-dog romanticism that could have come from Motown\u2026 if it were hijacked by a 6-foot-4-inch nose-ringed, gambling-obsessed, ex-high school quarterback from the slums.\n\nYoung Thug\u2019s breakthrough came with 2013\u2019s Stoner. It was an entirely different species from what had come before, forged from a DNA mutation whose bloodstream was equal parts strawberry jolly rancher, promethazine, weed, molly, and esoteric powders beamed in from the plug on Betelgeuse.\n\nOn Stoner, he shrieks and moans, vomiting nightmare cantillations and euphoric wails, stretching syllables until they collapse under the stress, disappearing into the vanishing point. He spell-screams \u201cL-E-A-N-I-N-G\u201d like a spoiled child begging to open his Christmas presents early, but discovering that the only things under the tree are Styrofoam and codeine. Thug\u2019s voice contorts into neon lava; he uses it like Jimi Hendrix using a wah-wah-pedal. It\u2019s a live power cord writhing in the street during a lightning storm.\n\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible to guess who will end up surpassing him, or at least annexing new territory\n\nThe next three years marked a run that can match nearly any creative streak in history. There was the Rich Gang project with fellow Atlanta MC Rich Homie Quan (whose own stylistic influence is often overlooked), which somehow fulfilled Quan\u2019s boast that they were the \u201chardest duo since OutKast\u201d. As for Thug\u2019s solo work, the first two volumes of the Slime Season series are deliriously improvised masterpieces, often overlooked because like Rich Gang, they never made it onto streaming services. The zenith may have been 2015\u2019s Barter 6, his first project made available for commercial release. There\u2019s arguably his most innovative song, Halftime, where he introduces half-a-dozen different flows, switching direction with the startling agility and blinding speed of a Simone Biles floor routine.\n\nTo date, his rap family hasn\u2019t captured the full summation of what has made Thug immortal. Each of his proteges seem to work within a small parcel of his flows, melodies and vocal textures. It\u2019s nearly impossible to guess who will end up surpassing him, or at least annexing new territory. It could be his \u201clittle brothers\u201d Gunna and Lil Baby, whose collaboration Drip or Drown 2 reached number three on the Billboard album charts earlier this year. This summer, Thug and Future announced that the little brothers would join their elders for a Super Slimey sequel, forming an Atlanta rap Avengers.\n\nWeighing art is more complex and inscrutable than merely playing a game of spot the influence\n\nThat said, there is an argument that the first half-generation of Thug-influenced rappers have already transformed his innovations into something singular. Travis Scott famously cribbed Thug\u2019s Pick Up the Phone for one of his first huge solo hits, and it\u2019s obvious that the Houston rapper\u2019s ad-libs, vocal pitch and melodies are derived from Thug, albeit blended with 808s and Yeezus-era Kanye).\n\nPlayboi Carti has become one of the biggest artists of the moment by triangulating Chicago artist Chief Keef with Thug. Philadelphia-born Lil Uzi Vert rapped like Meek Mill until he moved to Atlanta, signed to DJ Drama\u2019s label, and popped up on Slime Season 2.\n\nOf course, weighing art is more complex and inscrutable than merely playing a game of spot the influence. A hit song like Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s XO Tour Llif3 was clearly informed by Uzi\u2019s own life and emotions, not to mention the mall punk of the last decade. But it\u2019s hard to imagine it existing or having the impact it did without Young Thug laying the foundation.\n\nIt\u2019s been 20 years since that MTV Music Awards where Eminem famously stormed the stage with a hundred lookalikes with bleached hair, white tees, and blue jeans. The idea was that he embodied the millions of aggrieved middle-American white boys obsessed with rap, who up until that point hadn\u2019t seen themselves credibly represented within the genre. For a year or two after Eminem blew up, every major label attempted to trot out their own Eminem replicant, but none survived (save for a few classic Bubba Sparxx singles).\n\nBut now tastes and music distribution models have changed, and with it, the desire to hear artists that are better or at least different. If you were going to redo that same awards show today, you might do it with 100 Young Thugs standing in a straight line onstage, the alien visionary at the forefront, his descendants in designer clothes and dyed hair, taking his cue and rapping along simultaneously. It would be hard to hear the difference over the sound of the applause.\n\nMore on BBC Music\u2019s greatest hip-hop songs of all time:\n\nThe 25 greatest hip-hop songs of all time\n\nWhat critics had to say about the top 10\n\nFull list of critics who participated \u2013 and how they voted\n\nTrends and surprises in the poll (not available in UK)\n\nWhy are there so few women in hip-hop polls?\n\nPlaylist of the top 25 songs (Spotify)", "description": "The Atlanta star has become his own genre; he is the sun king at the centre of rap\u2019s solar system", "authors": ["Jeff Weiss"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7r/md/p07rmdsh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
