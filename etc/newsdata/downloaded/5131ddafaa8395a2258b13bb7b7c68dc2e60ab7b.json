Lawyers for both men said they would follow Trump\u2019s orders.\n\nCorey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, who never worked for the White House, is expected to attend the hearing as its sole witness on Tuesday. In a separate letter, Cipollone said Lewandowski should not reveal private conversations with Trump beyond what is in the former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report.\n\nDemocrats are challenging such claims of \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d in a lawsuit against the former White House counsel Don McGahn, who defied a subpoena earlier this year on Trump\u2019s orders. They say that such a claim does not legally exist.\n\nThe House judiciary committee chairman, Jerrold Nadler, invited the three men to testify at the hearing as part of the panel\u2019s inquiry into Mueller\u2019s report and what Nadler is calling an \u201caggressive series of hearings\u201d this fall to determine whether Trump should be impeached. The committee has so far been hobbled by the White House\u2019s blockade of witness testimony and document requests, and the House speaker, Nancy, Pelosi has said she wants to wait to see what happens in court before making a decision on impeachment.\n\nPlay Video 1:27 'Our subpoenas are not optional': Democrats stonewalled again by Donald Trump\n\nIn another letter to Nadler, Brant W Bishop, Porter\u2019s lawyer, said that his client was trapped between \u201ccompeting and incompatible demands from coordinate and coequal branches\u201d and would, for now, defy the subpoena. He indicated that Porter would testify if he was instructed to by the courts.\n\n\u201cSuch conflicting demands must be resolved through an accommodation between the executive and legislative branches, or by the Judiciary,\u201d Bishop wrote. \u201cIn the meantime, because the inquiry at issue relates to his service as a senior official at the White House, Mr. Porter must respect the White House\u2019s instruction.\u201d\n\nIn the letter regarding Lewandowski, Cipollone wrote that his conversations with Trump \u201care protected from disclosure by long-settled principles protecting executive branch confidentiality interests\u201d.\n\nLewandowski would be free to discuss Trump\u2019s campaign, which he worked on until he was fired in the summer of 2016. But the judiciary panel is most interested in Mueller\u2019s report, and whether Trump obstructed justice.\n\nAccording to the report, Trump asked Lewandowski twice to ask the former attorney general Jeff Sessions to limit Mueller\u2019s investigation. Trump said that if Sessions would not meet with Lewandowski, then Lewandowski should tell Sessions he was fired.\n\nLewandowski never delivered the message but asked Dearborn \u2013 a former Sessions aide \u2013 to do it. Dearborn said he was uncomfortable with the request and also declined to deliver it, according to the report.\n\nPorter, a former staff secretary in the White House, took frequent notes during his time there that were detailed throughout the report. He resigned last year after public allegations of domestic violence by his two ex-wives.", "description": "Corey Lewandowski told to limit his remarks as sole witness at what committee calls first impeachment hearing", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94ca04ea12e80bb4738e6553deb68313d5aa3c06/0_0_2110_1266/master/2110.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5981e52b2a73dd8f04d4477f725efb8a", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
