You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe package \u2013 likely to be brought back if there is an election and the Conservatives win \u2013 is dominated by six other bills to fully implement Brexit, as well as the \u201cpaused\u201d withdrawal agreement bill.\n\nAlso among 26 pieces of legislation, unveiled by the Queen at last week\u2019s state opening of parliament, were measures for tougher sentencing of serious and sexual criminals, as well as an environment bill with increased powers to tackle air pollution and introduce new charges on single-use plastic items.\n\nThe programme also includes controversial legislation to require voters to show picture ID at polling stations, which opposition parties and campaigners warn will exclude thousands of people \u2013 particularly the vulnerable, disadvantaged and elderly \u2013 from taking part in elections, while doing little to counter fraud.\n\nAnd there are also promises of future bills to accelerate improvements to the NHS, reform adult social care and modernise the treatment of people with mental health problems, at potentially huge financial cost.\n\nBut the prime minister was accused of betraying private tenants after shelving Theresa May\u2019s promise to end the misery of \u2018no-fault evictions\u2019.\n\nThe absence of a housing bill cast doubt on a raft of measures pledged by the last prime minister \u2013 also including help for leaseholders and a regulator to enforce new homes of a higher-standard.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
