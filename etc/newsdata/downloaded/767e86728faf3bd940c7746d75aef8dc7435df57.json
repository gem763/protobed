Jim Himes: Trump-Ukraine developments 'really ups the ante' on impeachment", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Jim Himes on Monday said the latest developments involving President Trump and a conversation with the Ukrainian president in which he apparently discussed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden \u201creally ups the ante\u201d in terms of House Democrats\u2019 moving forward on impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cExtorting a foreign leader for the purposes of getting that leader to do your political work, to try to find dirt on your opponent, is extortion,\u201d Mr. Himes said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cIt is using the assets of the United States of America and the public trust for your own corrupt, if you will, ends, certainly political ends.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that the House will move into impeachment mode right away, but this really ups the ante,\u201d said Mr. Himes, Connecticut Democrat.\n\nMr. Himes pointed to a letter House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent to colleagues on Sunday saying that if the administration failed to turn over a whistleblower complaint reportedly tied to the conversation, they \u201cwill be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of hard not to read between the lines there about what she means,\u201d Mr. Himes said.\n\nMr. Trump on Sunday appeared to confirm reports that he spoke about Mr. Biden during a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but said he did nothing wrong and that he delayed aid to the country because others weren\u2019t offering a fair share.\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine has got a lot of problems,\u201d Mr. Trump told White House reporters as he left for a rally in Texas.\n\n\u201cThe new president is saying that he\u2019s going to be able to rid the country of corruption, and I said that would be a great thing. We had a great conversation,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Trump urged Mr. Zelensky \u201cabout eight times\u201d to cooperate with his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani on investigating Mr. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, over a possible nexus between the son\u2019s business interests and the vice president\u2019s push in 2016 to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday.\n\n\u2022 Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
