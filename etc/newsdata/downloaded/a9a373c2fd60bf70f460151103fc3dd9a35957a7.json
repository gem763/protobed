Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower.

As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy.

Giuliani insists that he is fighting corruption on Trump\u2019s behalf and has called himself a \u201chero\u201d. AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/19 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year. Getty 8/19 Joe Biden The former vice-president is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination, which would make him Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2020 election. Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant.

Getty\n\nWhen House speaker Nancy Pelosi last month announced a formal impeachment investigation of Mr Trump after a whistleblower complaint emerged accusing the president of seeking to pressure the leader of Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, the White House sought to dismiss it as nothing more than a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d and refused to co-operate.\n\nMr Trump made the same point at an election rally in this city, during which he also attacked local congresswoman Ilhan Omar, and claimed Minneapolis had accepted too many Somali refugees.\n\n\u201cThey know they can\u2019t win the 2020 election, so they\u2019re pursuing the insane impeachment witch-hunt,\u201d he told supporters.\n\nMr Painter, who currently serves as vice-chair of a government accountability watchdog, claimed the president\u2019s wrongdoings went beyond those even of Richard Nixon, one of just four US presidents to be subjected to the threat of impeachment, and who resigned before congress could oust him.\n\nThe lawyer, who last year failed in a bid to win a Senate seat in Minnesota, said both Mr Trump and Mr Nixon were guilty of several offences, including the obstruction of justice.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

I would say far stronger than the evidence against Nixon,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat we did not have with Richard Nixon that we have with Donald Trump is efforts to persuade a foreign power to interfere in our election, to dig up dirt on our opponents.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u2018Richard Nixon did not do that. Richard Nixon was a crook but at least we were confident he was our crook, as opposed to working with foreign governments against his fellow Americans.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the president have said unlike a number of his predecessors, Mr Trump has sought to keep Americans out of foreign wars, especially in the Middle East. While Mr Trump was widely criticised over his decision to pull US troops out of northeast Syria and permit Turkey to launch a military assault on Kurdish fighters who had previously been allies, the president campaigned to bring home US soldiers.\n\nMr Painter said it was possible to go back through American history and criticise the policies and actions of Mr Trump\u2019s predecessors, including Mr Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq based on false evidence of weapons of mass destruction, Barack Obama\u2019s controversial use of drone strikes in places such as Pakistan, and the decisions that plunged the country into the Vietnam war.\n\n\u201cWe can go back through American history and find examples of bad history and bad policies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut none of that excuses Donald Trump. He is the only president I know of to ask foreign countries to dig up dirt on his political opponents to interfere in American elections.\u201d\n\nMr Painter said given most of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates had backed calls to impeach the president, it was essential the party moved forward promptly.\n\nHe said the house should set out formal articles of impeachment before the end of the year to give time for the Senate to consider the matter in the spring. If it was left later than that, it would look like it was intended to interfere with the election.\n\nHe added: \u201cIf Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats don\u2019t impeach him, Trump would ridicule his opponent in the debate stage and could very well win a second term.\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s multiple abuses of office are more serious than those even of Richard Nixon, and Democrats must trigger their effort to impeach him before the end of the year, a former top Republican administration lawyer has claimed.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/18/painter-impeach-2.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
