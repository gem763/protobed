When someone else asked about birthdays last week, I mumbled: \u201cOh, I\u2019ll probably organise a drink somewhere,\u201d which also wasn\u2019t true, because, just like every other October, I\u2019ll be operating a policy of dodging and denial.\n\nI don\u2019t like birthdays. Never have done. Not when I was little and it involved the wild decadence of a Wimpy Brown Derby doughnut with chocolate drizzle, and even less so as I grew older. Now, birthdays mark the years passing with ghoulish rapidity, as New Year lunges into Valentine\u2019s Day, then summer solstice into Bonfire Night.\n\nWhere did the last year go? How have some of my contemporaries spent it winning Emmys, completing triathlons and lavishly renovating barns in an eco-compliant manner? I\u2019ve still not quite got round to replacing the landing lightbulbs, which fused last October, because that involves a step-ladder. What are you doing for your birthday, Grace? Screaming into a mirror, in the dark.\n\nWith birthdays, the planet divides roughly into two sets of people, and both find the other equally bamboozling. There are those who adore their birthday, or their \u201cbirthday week\u201d, as they often call it, unveiling a giddy schedule of opportunities to spend time with them, clutch their face and love them. All this cuddling, singing and cake unveiling will take place in holiday cottages, marquees, private dining rooms and roped-off areas of pubs. It will be costly, time-consuming and exhausting, but it\u2019s easier to acquiesce and parp along supportively on a kazoo. These people loved birthdays as a child, and as adults count down to their big day on Facebook, saying: \u201cFive more sleeps to Joyce-Fest!\u201d\n\nThen there are folk like me, and perhaps you, too, who feel anxious \u2013 for weeks beforehand \u2013 that anyone might be secretly commissioning ganache icing on their behalf. I mean, what if that hypothetical person is going to a lot of hassle, which is in turn making them secretly resentful? Won\u2019t they, by trying to prove they love me, end up loving me a little less?\n\nWe\u2019re not the ones asking people to block three days out of the diary in June 2020 and cart a fancy-dress outfit to the Yorkshire Dales\n\nAnd what if they try to organise a party and find no one wants to come? Or what if my friends say they\u2019ll come, but only because they feel obliged, when they\u2019d rather watch TV horizontally in loose-fitting lounge pants? Because isn\u2019t that what we\u2019d all rather do, all of the time, always?\n\nThis is the sort of thing that crosses my mind before birthdays. Also that I do not want any presents, not ever. If I desire something badly enough, I\u2019ll buy it for myself; and this thing will never be a Yankee Candle gift set or a book bought beside a shop till that delivers The Tao Of Pooh. This type of tat, accompanied by surprise singing, will also make me anxious.\n\nObviously this whining could make me \u2013 and other birthday-avoiders \u2013 sound self-absorbed and childish. But then we\u2019re not the ones asking people to block three days out of the diary in June 2020, cart a fancy-dress outfit to the Yorkshire Dales and check out your \u201cDirty Thirty\u201d gift register, which suggests pooling funds for a Swarovski decanter. We\u2019re not the ones counting our birthday cards, identifying the friend who missed the Royal Mail delivery and posting passive-aggressive memes on Insta. We\u2019re just ambling on, humbly asking for nothing gift-wrapped from anyone; life\u2019s little troupers.\n\nIs it too soon to argue about Christmas? Some monsters among us are very organised Read more\n\nIn fact, we are life\u2019s immortal little troupers, because by hiding from birthdays, locking down all social media reminders and refusing to blow out candles, we have found the secret of circumnavigating time. Potentially.\n\nStick with me, as this is my least watertight but heartfelt theory of all. My plan, for several years, has been to simply let one year merge into the other, without fanfare, so that the Grim Reaper won\u2019t notice me and move me closer to my exit interview. And it\u2019s working. Look at me: I\u2019m floating agelessly and enigmatically through the epochs, like Virginia Woolf\u2019s Orlando. By entirely refusing to eat Victoria sponge with candles or put up rows of cards with funny captions like \u201cDecaying Old Bag\u201d or \u201cHow ancient?\u201d, I am buying myself decades, if not another century.\n\nThis won\u2019t happen to you, Joyce, in your minibus en route to a friends-and-family paintballing excursion. We all know you\u2019re 57. You\u2019re carrying the number in gold helium balloons and wearing a sash that says \u201cBirthday Girl\u201d. Bang the big birthday drum if you like \u2013 I\u2019m staying shtum. Death is going to find you before me. You\u2019re making it too damn easy.", "description": "My plan is to hide and let one year merge into the other, thereby circumnavigating time altogether", "authors": ["Grace Dent"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9044a6203b4531531eeea22455861480eb6f7154/0_0_2268_1361/master/2268.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=aebe7e49d1a724729346c05863560377", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
