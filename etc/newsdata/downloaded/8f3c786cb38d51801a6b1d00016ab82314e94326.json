REUTERS/Scott Heppell - RC180C44C550/File Photo\n\nOYAK\u2019s affiliate Ataer Holdings was granted a 10-week exclusivity period to take over British Steel, which went into liquidation on May 22, ending on Thursday.\n\nBritain is now looking to resume talks with other interested parties, the Official Receiver said on Wednesday.\n\nTwo sources with knowledge of the matter said that India\u2019s JSW Group (JSTL.NS) and Sanjeev Gupta\u2019s GFG Alliance, which had expressed an interest after the steel producer was put into compulsory liquidation, will likely return to bid.\n\nJSW and GFG Alliance were not immediately available to comment.\n\n\u201cWhile discussions with Ataer are continuing, discussions with other parties who have expressed continued and renewed interest in acquiring the whole British Steel business will now be possible,\u201d the Official Receiver said.\n\n\u201cAtaer remain very much interested in acquiring the business and we remain in detailed discussions with them to conclude a sale,\u201d it added.\n\nBritish Steel produces high-margin, long steel products used in construction and rail networks. It has a series of contracts to supply steel rails to customers in Britain, Italy, Spain, Belgium and other European countries, as well as a 60,000 tonne a year supply contract with digger maker Caterpillar.\n\nIt sources iron ore and coal, essential primary materials in the making of steel products, from several countries including Australia, Brazil and Argentina.\n\nIts closure would impact 5,000 jobs in Scunthorpe, northern England, and a further 20,000 jobs in the supply chain.\n\nThe European steel industry as a whole says it faces a crisis as U.S. imports tariffs are pushing extra volumes of steel into Europe.\n\nOn top of that, steelmakers in Britain pay some of the highest green taxes and energy costs in the world, and face high labor costs and business rates.", "description": "A deal to save Britain's second largest steelmaker British Steel from collapse is in jeopardy as exclusive negotiations with Turkey's military pension fund OYAK approach a deadline without an agreement.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444137625&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1BV", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
