They initially hunted humpbacks because they were found in the near-shore waters and were very accessible.\u201d\n\nIn the 1960s the whaling industry collapsed because there were no longer any whales to hunt and by the 1980s the population numbered just a few hundred.\n\nTreaties were signed to prevent hunters killing them and other protections were put in place. The whales are now listed as being of \u201cleast concern\u201d on the IUCN Red List of endangered species, but there is uncertainty about different sub-populations.\n\nHumpbacks are believed to return faster than other whale species like blue whales because they mature faster, have a shorter gap between pregnancies and have centralised breeding grounds.\n\n\u201cContinued monitoring is needed to understand how these whales will respond to modern threats and to climate-driven changes to their habitats,\u201d researchers wrote in the paper published in the Royal Society Open Science.\n\n\u201cThe population status is much more optimistic than previously thought and abundance should reach its pre-exploitation level within the next 10 years or so, assuming mortality from anthropogenic threats remains low.\u201d\n\nIt is illegal to approach a humpback whale within 100m by sea, or 300m by plane.\n\nNew research also shows these whales use flippers to trap their prey by swatting the water, according to another paper published in Royal Society Open Science.\n\nResearchers from the University of Alaska Fairbanks were able to capture this behaviour on video for the first time.\n\nScientists monitored the whales over a period of three years in southeast Alaska and studied a behaviour called \u201cpectoral herding\u201d where whales use their flippers to generate bubbles and confuse their prey.", "description": "Southwest Atlantic\u00a0humpback whales have recovered from the brink of extinction and are\u00a0now reaching\u00a0record numbers not seen since whaling started in the early 20th century.\u00a0 Before whaling, the global population was\u00a0about 27,000 and now there are an estimated 25,000, meaning they have recovered 90 per cent of their numbers, a new study has found.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/16/12/istock-1028748818.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
