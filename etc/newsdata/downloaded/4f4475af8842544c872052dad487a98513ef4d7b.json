The HP Spectre Folio is unique thanks to its leather exterior, making it perfect for professionals or anyone who likes the look of it \u2014 and for a limited time, it's on sale at Amazon for an impressive $482 off its normal price. With the discount, you pay $917.99 instead of the original price of $1,399.99.\n\nThis particular variant of the laptop is pretty high performance, but perhaps the coolest thing about it is its design. The Folio's leather exterior looks great and extends onto the palm rests and around the keyboard. It's a super classy look, and helps make the laptop look more like a fancy folder than a piece of tech.\n\nThe device also has a 2-in-1 design, so it has a touchscreen and can be used in tablet mode. Its 13.3-inch screen has a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels, which looks crisp and bright.\n\nOf course, perhaps even more important than the design of the device are the specs under the hood. The HP Spectre Folio 2-in-1 laptop boasts an Intel Core i7 chip, coupled with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB solid-state drive. Those specs makes it a solid choice for anyone using this laptop for work in an office or for college.\n\nIn our testing, we found the laptop to be a unique-looking, high-performing machine. Our reviewer called it a \"workhorse\" that's well worth the original price tag.\n\nAs mentioned, the HP Spectre Folio is discounted by $482, bringing it down to a reasonable price of $917.99. The stock appears to be limited on Amazon, and we do not know how long the deal will last, so you may want to act fast if you're interested.", "description": "The HP Spectre Folio is one of the most popular laptops in the PC market, and for a limited time you can save $482 on the device at Amazon.", "authors": ["Christian De Looper"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d850a262e22af5870089bc8-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
