The other railroads' lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nCiting meetings, phone calls and emails, Hyundai and Kia accused the railroads of conspiring to impose fuel surcharges, under the guise of a fuel cost recovery program, that ultimately generated billions of dollars in profit at customers' expense.\n\nTheir lawsuits cited a 2007 independent study that said the railroads' fuel surcharge revenue exceeded their fuel costs by more than $6 billion from 2003 to March 2007.\n\nHyundai and Kia sued 6-1/2 weeks after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. said nationwide litigation over the surcharges could not proceed as a class action because more than 2,000 members of the proposed class were not harmed. The automakers' law firm also worked on that case.\n\nThe cases in the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, are Hyundai Motor America Inc v BNSF Railway Co et al, No. 19-01878; Hyundai Motor America Inc v BNSF Railway Co et al, No. 19-01880; an Kia Motors America Inc v BNSF Railway Co et al, No. 19-01881.", "description": "Hyundai, Kia sue four big U.S. railroads over fuel surcharges", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF902ZS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
