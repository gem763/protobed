They are torn between a wish to finally put the Brexit issue to bed and a devout desire to avoid the economic ramification of Britain leaving without a divorce deal in place.\n\nJohnson on Sunday used surrogates to make the case that he likely has the votes needed to gain passage for his new Brexit plan and won\u2019t need any delay.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC he believes Johnson has enough support to get his deal through Parliament, but added the government would keep talking with its Northern Ireland ally, the Democratic Unionist Party, to persuade it to back the deal.\n\nSo far, the party, which holds 10 seats in Parliament, has refused to support Johnson\u2019s agreement because it treats Northern Ireland differently than other parts of the U.K.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep talking to the DUP and see if there\u2019s any further reassurances that can be provided,\u201d Raab said.\n\nThe DUP votes might well give Johnson a comfortable margin, but it seems steadfast in its opposition to the plan, which replaces an earlier divorce deal negotiated by Theresa May\u2019s government but rejected three times by Parliament.\n\nMonday will also feature more legal action, more arm-twisting, cajoling and veiled threats by Johnson and his ministers and more amendments designed by lawmakers to stymie Johnson\u2019s plan to have Britain leave the 28-nation bloc on Oct. 31.\n\nIn the midst of all this, EU leaders and officials across the English Channel were pondering whether to grant the British leader a Brexit extension that he doesn\u2019t even want.\n\nAs required by law, Johnson sent a letter to the EU late Saturday night seeking a delay to Britain\u2019s impending Oct. 31 departure. He waited until the last possible moment, withheld his signature and immediately followed it with a signed letter indicating that he doesn\u2019t actually favor another Brexit extension.\n\n\u201cMy view, and the government\u2019s position, (is) that a further extension would damage the interests of the U.K. and our EU partners, and the relationship between us,\u201d Johnson wrote to European Council President Donald Tusk.\n\nHis decision to send a second letter saying he doesn\u2019t really want an extension is likely to trigger court challenges from opponents who believe he intentionally set out to block Parliament\u2019s intent even if he technically complied with legal requirements.\n\nThe Court of Session in Scotland is already considering the matter and it may end up being decided in the U.K. Supreme Court, which in September ruled that Johnson had acted unlawfully when he suspended Parliament for five weeks as the Brexit deadline crept closer.\n\nScottish National Party legislator Joanna Cherry, part of a group that brought the earlier successful case against Johnson, said the legal battle over Brexit continues.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re back in court on Monday morning and it will be possible then to secure the court\u2019s assistance if the prime minister has flouted the law and the promises he gave to the court,\u201d she said.\n\nThe court action is aimed at keeping Johnson from taking Britain out of the EU without a deal.\n\nJohnson has long declared that he plans to take the U.K. out of the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a divorce deal, and his minister in charge of Brexit again emphasized that stance.\n\n\u201cWe are going to leave by Oct. 31st,\u201d Michael Gove insisted Sunday. \u201cWe have the means and the ability to do so.\u201d\n\nGove also said he was holding a special meeting to discuss Operation Yellowhammer, the government\u2019s \u201cno-deal\u201d planning apparatus, to make sure Britain is ready for an Oct. 31 departure. The government\u2019s own analysts have warned an abrupt break with the EU could lead to recession, massive delays at British ports, and shortages in food and prescription medicine.\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said Tusk would consult with other leaders \u201cin the next days\u201d about Johnson\u2019s request, but most signs indicate the EU would prefer an extension to an abrupt no-deal Brexit.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne, whose country holds the European Union\u2019s rotating presidency, said Sunday \u201cit makes sense to allow extra time.\u201d\n\nWhile Johnson\u2019s Conservatives are focused on getting more votes, the opposition Labour Party was calling for a second referendum on the whole question of leaving the EU.\n\nLabour\u2019s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said it is \u201cinevitable\u201d that lawmakers opposed to Brexit will put forward an amendment seeking a second referendum \u2014 something strongly opposed by Johnson and his government.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s this deal or any future deal, it\u2019s got to go back so the public can say, \u2018Do you want to leave on these terms?\u2019\u201d Starmer said. \u201cIf so, then we do. If not, we remain.\u201d", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces a frenzied week of activity in Parliament, and possibly in the courts, as he tries to woo rebellious lawmakers in...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP814_borisj_ZG_20190820163308.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
