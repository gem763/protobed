Only 39 per cent expect their sales volumes to rise.\n\n\"It's about not over-committing on expansion plans...it's about being prudent,\" said Suresh Sidhu, chief executive officer of edotco Group, a telecoms infrastructure firm headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, with business across South and South-east Asia.\n\n\"I don't see people stopping, I just see people thinking about stopping. We definitely have not scaled up very aggressive plans...in times of great complexity and unpredictability, people generally don't spend.\"\n\nEconomic indicators also suggest a gloomy outlook.\n\nRising global protectionism could shave 0.8 per cent from the world's economic output next year, the International Monetary Fund said last week.\n\nFlagging demand has already flayed Asian firms such as Samsung Electronics Co, whose profit halved for the June quarter, and automakers from Japan's Mazda Motor Corp to India's Tata Motors Ltd.\n\nAnd data released this month showed China's economic woes deepened in August, with growth in industrial production at its weakest in more than 17 years, while USmanufacturing also shrank.\n\nAlvin Liew, senior economist at Singapore's United Overseas Bank, said the trade war is the biggest driver of the slowdown that will probably deepen unless a breakthrough in negotiations can recharge business confidence and investment.\n\n\"I don't think anybody has the kind of delusion that both countries will come to a full-scale agreement and the world will turn into a better place after that,\" he said.\n\n\"But there's still some hope holding out and some optimism that they could do an interim trade deal...something to put some certainty back,\" Liew said. \"At the end of the day both sides know that this is not good overall.\"\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [SINGAPORE] Confidence among companies in Asia lifted slightly in the September quarter from 10-year lows, but most firms do not plan on hiring or expect business to pick up as they see a risk of a global recession looming, a Thomson Reuters/Insead survey found. .
