The sponge soaks up the polish, leaving behind plenty of glitter.\n\nThis glitter is then dabbed onto the finger nail and left to dry.\n\nOnce it's dry, simply peel off the liquid latex and apply a top coat to the glitter to give it a sleek, shiny finish.\n\nAnd Voil\u00e0, fabulous glitter nails!", "description": "Ever wondered why your glitter nail polish doesn't look as good as you'd hoped?
