Local groups are being encouraged to run tree-planting events and councils are being asked for permission to plant trees on their land, or outside schools and other publicly owned properties. Businesses are also being urged to plant trees on their own premises if possible.\n\nPeople without gardens or the means to plant their own trees are being encouraged to spot potential sites and ask their local council or the landowner for permission to plant.\n\nGrow your own forest: how to plant trees to help save the planet Read more\n\nBy 2025, the Woodland Trust \u2013 the charity behind the Big Climate Fightback \u2013 hopes to have planted a tree for every person in the country. All of the trees provided by the charity will be native broadleaf varieties, such as oak, birch and hawthorn.\n\nThe writer and broadcaster Sandi Toksvig has pledged to plant a tree and called on others to do the same. \u201cClimate change is a real threat and affects us all, but there is the simplest of all solutions: the humble tree,\u201d she said. \u201cI urge people to get off their sofas and plant a tree. It\u2019s very simple and you could be one in a million.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Committee on Climate Change, the government\u2019s statutory advisers on the climate crisis, the UK should have 1.5bn new trees by 2050 to meet the net zero carbon target, set in line with international scientific warnings on the climate crisis. The government has set a target of 5,000 hectares a year for England alone, but planting rates have fallen well short of that, with last year only 1,420 hectares (3,508 acres) of new woodland planted.\n\nHowever, trees will also need to be cared for after planting to ensure they survive, so groups are encouraged to participate beyond the planting stage. The Woodland Trust also warned that tree planting alone was not enough. \u201cAs individuals, we all need to do much more to reduce our impact on the planet by cutting emissions and reducing pressure on resources,\u201d said Darren Moorcroft, the charity\u2019s chief executive.", "description": "Woodland Trust urges volunteers to grab a spade and help tackle the climate crisis", "authors": ["Fiona Harvey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32fe7b263f2135d8bdb7ff0fd2165e0723724af5/0_159_6037_3622/master/6037.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6668fbaf509738d43a792ddfd35a244f", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
