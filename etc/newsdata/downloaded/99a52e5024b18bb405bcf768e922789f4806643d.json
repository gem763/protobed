Protecting that fast-growing slice of the electorate has become a major priority for voting rights groups, which are expanding their legal staffs and scouring the country for potential barriers to challenge as they prepare for the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAD\n\nWhile most of the legal challenges are being made in Republican-controlled states, both Virginia\u2019s and Fairfax County\u2019s governments are controlled by Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe take any policies or practices that might have the effect of suppressing student votes very seriously, and we\u2019ll be working tirelessly to protect their rights in the 2020 election cycle,\u201d said John Powers, a lawyer with the D.C.-based Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which has challenged the 171 application rejections in Virginia.\n\nAD\n\nScott, the Fairfax County registrar, said the origin of the problem is that GMU \u2014 a sprawling state university of more than 25,000 undergraduates about 20 miles west of Washington \u2014 allows any student to have a campus mailbox, whether they live on campus or not.\n\nThat made it impossible to discern eligibility for the students who listed their post box number with the school\u2019s main campus address, rather than their dorm name or off-campus residential address, Scott said.\n\nAD\n\nAt least three of the 171 students actually live in neighboring Prince William County, meaning they\u2019re not eligible to vote in Fairfax, he said.\n\n\u201cThe point is, unless we know where on campus you reside, we can\u2019t register you,\u201d Scott said.\n\nAD\n\nPowers said his primary objection is to Scott\u2019s decision to send a \u201cnotice of rejection\u201d to each of the 171 students. Virginia election law prohibits local registrars from rejecting an application because of insufficient address information. In that case, the registrar is supposed to send a request for information \u2014 not a notice of rejection.\n\nScott said that after mailing the rejection letters, his office sent follow-up letters to students specifying how to fix their application: by providing either a dorm name indicating that they live on campus, or a private residential address indicating they live elsewhere. The office initially gave students until Oct. 26 to act, then moved the deadline back to Nov. 2, three days before the election.\n\nAD\n\nBut Powers said the initial rejection letters could dissuade the students from fixing their registrations.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo some extent the damage may have been done,\u201d Powers said. \u201cSome of these students may be first-time voters. Essentially what\u2019s happened is, they\u2019ve gotten a letter saying, \u2018We rejected your application.\u2019 There\u2019s no mention of Oct. 26 or Nov. 2 or any kind of cure period.\u201d\n\nScott conceded that students do not often check their campus mailboxes and may not have seen the correspondence. He said it\u2019s too soon to say how many students will successfully fix their applications, as he just sent the most recent letter this week.\n\nCarson Heisel won\u2019t be one of them. Heisel, 18, a freshman studying forensic science at GMU, said he\u2019s too busy with school to redo his application.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was definitely planning to vote, but I was not interested enough to go back and take the time and fill everything out,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nIf the students don\u2019t fix their applications, they will be unable to vote in a momentous election on Nov. 5 in Virginia, the only state in the country where contests will determine the legislature\u2019s balance of power this year.\n\nRepublicans are defending thin margins of 51 to 48 in the House and 20 to 19 in the Senate, with one vacancy in each chamber. With Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam in the Executive Mansion, a Democratic sweep of the legislature would give the party its first consolidated hold on power in a generation.\n\nAD\n\nThe Lawyers\u2019 Committee is one of numerous national civil rights groups monitoring election practices across the country as the 2020 election approaches.\n\nKristen Clarke, the group\u2019s president, said the goal is to increase the staff, now featuring about 35 attorneys, by about 50 percent in the coming months.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a larger threat, a greater need, more complaints to resolve and cases to be filed,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cWe want to meet the demands that we face in this era.\u201d\n\nGMU is not the only university with addresses that can present complications to students seeking to register to vote. James Madison University, another state school in Harrisonburg, Va., is so large that it is divided into two precincts, meaning students must include their dormitory name when they register to vote.\n\nAD\n\nIn the city of Prairie View, Tex., which doesn\u2019t have its own Zip code, students at Prairie View A&M University are sometimes assigned addresses listing the name of the neighboring town, prompting some of them to go to the wrong voting location.\n\nOne factor at GMU is the level of training of those working on registration drives. Maya Castillo with the New Virginia Majority, which conducted registration drives at GMU this year, said: \u201cWe\u2019re generally aware of some of the issues around student voter registration. It\u2019s something that we try as much as possible to train our team on. We want to make sure when we turn in voter registration applications they get registered. Sometimes that can get complicated.\u201d\n\nA GMU spokeswoman said the university has worked with the county registrar for years to \u201cconvey accurate information to students about voter registration.\u201d\n\nRose B. Pascarell, the school\u2019s vice president for university life, said once officials learned of the issues this year, they notified students to check their registration status.\n\nAD", "description": "The Fairfax County registrar rejected 171 registration applications of students who listed a general university address.", "authors": ["Amy Gardner", "National Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4jgFv9nO8V7BPDxROvAHh-LQook=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LUSNJLUMI4I6TNXUAMZVMUBNZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
