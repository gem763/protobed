Biden, the current front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, is connecting to \u201ctoday\u2019s\u201d Democratic party.\n\nHe said on Friday he\u2019s comfortable about his past comments, but said he\u2019ll support whoever the nominee ends up being \u201cwith energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do believe we need a progressive,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone here would doubt the party has moved in a much more progressive direction the last four years \u2014 that\u2019s where the energy is.\u201d\n\nHe said Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, a 2020 contender who said recently that Mr. Biden will generate \u201cvery little excitement,\u201d is making an \u201cimportant point.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, great respect to the vice president \u2014 he\u2019s certainly not presenting that agenda that will energize that vote,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cI believe in redemption \u2014 there\u2019s plenty of time. \u2026 There has to be a vision and a message and a believable presentation.\u201d\n\nMr. de Blasio joins a handful of other high-profile contenders who have ended their bids for the Democratic presidential nomination in recent weeks and months, including Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Rep. Eric Swalwell of California.\n\nMr. Hickenlooper has since announced a run for U.S. Senate in Colorado.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
