The print version is nearly as bad at a jaw-dropping #7,636.\n\nThe old saying goes there is no such thing as bad publicity, but that really was the only publicity this hardcover chunk of fake news received.\n\nThe book\u2019s hook was supposed to be the uncovering of an all-new allegation of sexual misconduct against our newest associate Supreme Court justice, and when news of this allegation hit the pages of the Times, it consumed the news-cycle. For at least forty-eight hours America was dropped right back into Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s bitter confirmation battle.\n\nOn top of all that publicity, the hoaxtresses behind the book enjoyed the additional hoopla of having almost every major Democrat presidential candidate call attention to the book by calling for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment.\n\nThe problem, though, is that in just a few short hours the book\u2019s hook was proven to be a lie \u2014 you know, just like every other phony allegation of misconduct against Kavanaugh was proven to be a lie.\n\nYou see, what the Times failed to tell us is that Kavanaugh\u2019s so-called victim has *ahem* no memory of being a victim. Apparently, the book itself reports this fact (but still smears Kavanaugh by reporting the ludicrous allegation), but the Times chose only to report there\u2019s a new allegation while leaving out the rather pertinent fact the so-called victim has no memory of being a victim.\n\nYes, you read that correctly\u2026 The book\u2019s sole hook is a steaming pile of fake news. How in the world the Times thought it could get away with claiming there\u2019s a new victim when the new victim says she\u2019s not a victim, or how the hoaxstresses thought it was ethical to publish such a thing\u2026 Man alive, the deceit makes your head spin.\n\nAnyway, what no one can blame this stunning failure on is a lack of interest or burnout with respect to Justice Kavanaugh. Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court has sold a total of 100,000 copies (print and digital) since its early July release. Written by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino, and almost completely ignored by the same media that threw a parade for Pogrebin and Kelly, three months after its debut, Justice is still out-selling the hoaxtresses\u2019 smear. As of right now Justice sits at #1,383 in print sales and #4,964 in Kindle sales.\n\nJustice also debuted at number one at Amazon and Publisher\u2019s Weekly and number two at Barnes and Noble and the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe failure of The Education of Brett Kavanaugh once again proves the power of New Media. Despite the imprimatur of the New York Times and millions of dollars in free publicity, New Media not only debunked its whole reason for being, New Media was also able to get the word out to potential buyers \u2014 even those leftists who so very much wanted it to be true \u2014 that they would be wasting their money on a hoax.\n\nOn the flip-side, even with the establishment media blacklisting them, Hemingway and Severino produced a best-seller because of their credibility in the New Media eco-system and bulletproof reporting. Believe me, if Justice on Trial had so much as a comma out of place, fake news outlets like CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times would have declared war against it and its authors.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
