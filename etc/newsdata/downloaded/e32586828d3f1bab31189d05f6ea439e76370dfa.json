For example, our prime minister visited a hospital, and met a sick child\u2019s father, who was angry at the state of that hospital, and angry that Boris Johnson visited for \u201ca press opportunity\u201d. And Johnson replied \u201cthere\u2019s no press here\u201d, in front of a big pile of press.\n\nBut luckily our most prominent political reporter dared to hold the powerful to account, by revealing the father is in the Labour Party, the deceitful pig.\n\nOther reporters might have been distracted by tittle-tattle, such as why hospitals have got into such a state. But she stuck to the main issue, uncovering the scoop that he was in the Labour Party with exhaustive research, such as looking at his page on Twitter that said \u201cI am in the Labour Party\u201d.\n\nThat stopped his game of pretending he was angry because his child was ill and the hospital was falling to bits. He probably planned it all along, arranging for the baby to be born a week earlier, having moved to that area because it was the sort of place Boris Johnson was likely to visit, then fed the newborn baby unripe apples and cigarette butts to make it ill so he could pop down the hospital, bump into the prime minister and make a cheap political point.\n\nAt least he should have been honest and said to Boris Johnson, \u201cHello prime minister, I\u2019m distraught as my child is ill and relying on a crumbling underfunded health service, which brings its anxieties but in the interests of balance, before I continue I should disclose I\u2019m a Labour activist\u201d, the way any reasonable person would have done.\n\nHolding the father up to scrutiny like this, is much more important that asking how a prime minister can claim \u201cthere are no press here\u201d, while stood amongst a squad of reporters and camera crew.\n\nThere\u2019s probably more footage from later on, when he said \u201cI\u2019m not the prime minister, I\u2019m one of the patients. I\u2019ve just had my nose removed. I can play the xylophone with Twiglets. My father invented the ostrich. Where are we going next?\u201d\n\nAt the moment he claimed \u201cthere\u2019s no press here\u201d, right next to him was a BBC camera crew, a video journalist and a journalist from the Press Association. But it\u2019s possible the prime minister hadn\u2019t noticed them, as cameras and tripods look uncannily like nurses and surgeons, and men with Press Association tags dangling round their neck are easily mistaken for bundles of laundry.\n\nSo he may not have known the press were there, as there were no other clues, apart from a notice sent out as a press release to the press including the Press Association. But we shouldn\u2019t expect him to work out from this sort of complicated jargon that his visit had anything to do with the press.\n\nDowning Street also sent round an operational note about the visit, to all the press, with the subject line \u201cPM to visit hospital in London\u201d. But this doesn\u2019t mean the visit was for the press. He was simply informing them so they could avoid the area, as it was likely to cause traffic congestion while they were on the way to a more important story about a squirrel that climbed onto a bus.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\nAfter the visit, the Press Association posted forty-five photos of the trip, despite the fact they weren\u2019t there, which is certain to be a major story in the next issue of Psychic News.\n\nYou might think, if someone was surrounded by a group of people that were obviously from one profession, which they had arranged themselves, it would be a worry if they couldn\u2019t see them. If you booked painters and decorators, then wandered into your kitchen while they were painting and decorating and said \u201cat least I won\u2019t meet any painters and decorators today\u201d, that might be a cause for concern.\n\nIf it happened in a hospital you might consider this was quite lucky, as the afflicted person could be wheeled straight in for an emergency scan to see if their brain had tipped upside-down.\n\nIf the person concerned was the prime minister, and this was only the latest example of such confusion, this could be a major story, but thankfully we live in a more thoughtful country than that so the actual major story is that the bloke he said it to, is in the bloody Labour Party.", "description": "There are times when you realise how fortunate we are, to live in a free society with a media that questions authority.
