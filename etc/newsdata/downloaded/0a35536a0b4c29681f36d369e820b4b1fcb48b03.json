No doubt that the Indian equity markets showed some strength on Friday, and may find some strong moves on October 28th, 2019 after a positive session in U.S. and European markets on October 25th, 2019. Everything looks rosy, while U.S. and Chinese officials are \"close to finalizing\" some parts of a trade agreement after high-level telephone discussions last Friday, the U.S. Trade Representative's office and China's Commerce Ministry said, with talks to continue. President Donald Trump has said he hopes to sign the deal with China's President Xi Jinping next month at a summit in Chile.\n\nBut, I find that the protracted trade war between the world's largest economies has already hurt manufacturing activity, exports and business confidence globally during the last 15 months; and continue to dent profits of many major industrial firms of the world; if both the U.S. and China delay in sealing a final deal. No doubt, may see sliding moves amid growing volatility during the month of November 2019; if this move becomes steeper during the upcoming month, an advent of market crash of 2019 will be confirmed. On the other hand, growing uncertainty over the delay in deciding the final deadline for Brexit deal, which may likely extend up to January 31st, 2010; looks evident enough to extend volatility in global equity markets.\n\nFinally, I conclude that the global equity markets may see steep sliding moves during the month of November, which may continue to swell in December 2019.
