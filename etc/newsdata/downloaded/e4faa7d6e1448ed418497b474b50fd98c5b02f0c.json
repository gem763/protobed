Backed by the United States\u2019 right-wing media, Trump intends to hunker down in America\u2019s polarized battlefield and fight for his survival, even if that means dragging the country\u2019s institutions into the morass. The bulk of Republican politicians remain too afraid to turn against him, while administration officials and federal bureaucrats see their personal fate tethered to his moods.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nELECTION INTERFERENCE! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 3, 2019\n\n\u201cThe implicit day-to-day charge for many Trump advisers is simple,\u201d reported my colleagues at the White House. \u201cFigure out how to handle or even polish Trump\u2019s whims and statements, but do not have any illusion that you can temper his relentless personality, heavy consumption of cable news or thirst for political combat.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s disregard for long-standing norms leaves U.S. politics in a somewhat unfamiliar place. \u201cAuthoritarian regimes have this problem all the time \u2026 when all government activity is the product of the id of the leader,\u201d Timothy Naftali, a historian and former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, told my colleagues. \u201cBut in a republic, that\u2019s unusual.\u201d\n\nIf there is central theme to the age of Trump, it\u2019s precisely that: What was unusual in sophisticated republican democracies is becoming increasingly commonplace. And not just in the United States. The impeachment saga convulsing Washington \u2014 where an embattled leader is calling into question the very legitimacy of those opponents challenging his conduct \u2014 has, to a certain extent, analogues elsewhere.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a close Trump ally, complained of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d launched by his rivals as the country\u2019s attorney general pursues possible corruption charges against him. In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson \u2014 who came to power this year via the votes of a fraction of a fraction of the British public \u2014 smeared members of Parliament thwarting Brexit as agents of \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal.\u201d In India, the world\u2019s biggest democracy, the country\u2019s Hindu nationalist leaders routinely cast their rivals as \u201canti-national\u201d liberals who ought to move to Pakistan.\n\nOn both sides of the pond, talk of \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy theories is rife, often with an all-too-familiar undertone. Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son, laid the impeachment inquiry at the feet of Jewish financier George Soros \u2014 whose support of liberal causes over the years has made him a frequent target of anti-Semites and nativists. On Thursday, Jacob Rees-Mogg, an influential Brexiteer and current leader of the House of Commons, conspiratorially cited Soros as a supposed enemy of Brexit and backer of its British opponents. The remarks led to calls from Jewish politicians in Britain for Rees-Mogg to resign.\n\nGeorge Soros as a sinister international Jewish puppetmaster is the classic antisemitic trope of our time. If Jacob Rees Mogg didn't know that, he is a disturbingly ignorant man. If he does know, then where do you even begin. pic.twitter.com/iRSDe59ayg \u2014 Owen Jones\ud83c\udf39 (@OwenJones84) October 3, 2019\n\nThere are immediate consequences to such demagoguery, not least in the form of far-right terrorist attacks and violence carried out by people inflamed by this sort of rhetoric. But there\u2019s also a long-term toll, one that\u2019s more imperceptible, yet no less corrosive, to the body politic. It\u2019s the kind of erosion on display in places such as Hungary, Poland and Turkey, where majoritarian, nationalist politicians have steadily undermined democratic institutions and the liberal norms they\u2019re supposed to uphold.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe death of democracy is now typically administered in a thousand cuts,\u201d wrote the Stanford political scientist Larry Diamond earlier this year. \u201cIn one country after another, elected leaders have gradually attacked the deep tissues of democracy \u2014 the independence of the courts, the business community, the media, civil society, universities and sensitive state institutions like the civil service, the intelligence agencies and the police.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t need to look further than Trump\u2019s Twitter timeline. The president has lambasted any federal agency, independent civic institution or media organization he sees working against him, even when their employees can only be accused of doing the job they are supposed to do. State-appointed judges are either his judges or enemies. Journalists who say nice things about Trump are good; those who don\u2019t are \u201cfake.\u201d Law enforcement officials posing next to Trump along the southern border are heroes, but those investigating Trump\u2019s campaign or using internal channels to voice their alarm over his dealings are traitors.\n\nDiamond placed Trump at the center of \u201cAmerica\u2019s own political decay\u201d and observed how the president\u2019s excusing of \u201ca grim list of dictators\u201d abroad and embrace of nativist politics at home had \u201cshaken the post-World War II liberal order.\u201d He also blamed political cynicism on both sides of the aisle, \u201ccalcified systems that don\u2019t deliver public goods and complacent citizens who cannot bestir themselves to vote.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs myriad analysts have already argued, Trump is not a sui generis figure, but a symptom of American politics and, in particular, of the radicalization of the American right. \u201cThe GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics,\u201d wrote political scientists Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein in a prescient piece long ago in 2012. \u201cIt is ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.\u201d\n\nThe uproar over impeachment may only underscore these hard-line positions. It gives Trump the fuel to drive an angry, resentful reelection campaign, and it reveals the frailties of an American system bound together by fraying civic understandings and aging conventions.\n\n\u201cWhat makes Trump dangerous is that he exposes parts of liberal democracies that were only shadowily visible up until now,\u201d said Peter Sloterdijk, celebrity German philosopher and frequent critic of the left, in an interview with the New Yorker last year in which he spoke of the American president as a \u201cdegenerate sheriff,\u201d happy to flout the rules of the state he leads. \u201cIn democracies, there is always an oligarchic element, but Trump makes it extremely, comically visible.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
