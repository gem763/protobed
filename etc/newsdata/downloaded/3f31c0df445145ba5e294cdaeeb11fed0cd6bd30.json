Some still help send people to prison.", "language": "en", "text": "Revat Vara should not have gone to prison.\n\nOne night in 2006, Houston police pulled him over for a missing license plate and told him to walk a straight line.\n\nVara said that he hadn\u2019t had a drop to drink and that he passed the sobriety test. Officer William Lindsey said otherwise.\n\nAt trial, jurors were told about Lindsey\u2019s expertise evaluating drunken drivers. They were told about Vara\u2019s two previous DWIs.\n\nWhat jurors weren\u2019t told: Officer Lindsey had been found guilty of misconduct by his department 35 times. He was investigated for padding his overtime \u2013 by manipulating DWI arrests so he would have to be called to testify.\n\nRevat Vara spent 11 years in prison because of a missing front license plate and prosecutors' failure to disclose the disciplinary history of the officer who testified against him. Since his exoneration, he's been living in Houston.\n\nIn a case that came down to one man\u2019s word against another\u2019s, jurors believed the police officer. Vara was sentenced to 25 years in prison.\n\nWhat happened to Vara has been unconstitutional for more than 50 years.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1963 that prosecutors must tell anyone accused of a crime about all evidence that might help their defense. That includes sharing details about police officers who have committed crimes, lied on the job or whose honesty has been called into doubt.\n\nA USA TODAY Network investigation found that widespread failure by police departments and prosecutors to track problem officers makes it impossible to disclose that information to people whose freedom hinges on the integrity of law enforcement.\n\nReporters for USA TODAY and its partners, including the Chicago-based Invisible Institute, spent more than a year gathering Brady lists from police and prosecutors in thousands of counties to measure compliance with the landmark 1963 ruling in the Brady v. Maryland case.\n\nThe inconsistent compliance with the Brady requirements comes amid a nationwide debate over law enforcement tactics. A string of killings by police over the past five years in Ferguson, Missouri, Baltimore, Chicago and elsewhere have sparked unrest and a reckoning that put pressure on cities and mayors to crack down on problem officers.\n\nThe revelations also come as reversals of wrongful convictions pile up. The National Registry of Exonerations shows that cases overturned because of perjury and official misconduct by prosecutors or police have more than doubled from 2008 to 2018.\n\nUSA TODAY talked to dozens of prosecutors and police officials across the nation.\n\nTwo county prosecutors promised to alter their policies or procedures for complying with Brady\u2019s requirements in response to inquiries from USA TODAY.\n\n\u201cNow that you have raised this issue, we will consult with our corporation counsel and our circuit court supervisor about creating and maintaining a list,\u201d Maui County Prosecutor John Kim told the newspaper.\n\nMost prosecutors who don\u2019t keep a Brady list said they don\u2019t need one because they know all of their police officers well.\n\n\"I do not have a so-called Brady list. I do not have a written policy,\" said Steve Giddens, the district attorney in Talladega County, Alabama. \"I do not need one to follow the law.\u201d\n\nOthers raised concerns about unfairly jeopardizing law enforcement officers\u2019 jobs by placing them on a list based on minor or unfounded accusations.\n\nUnions representing law enforcement officers have been especially outspoken opponents. In California, the union representing Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies went to court to stop the department from disclosing 300 deputies with misconduct histories. The state Supreme Court ruled against the deputies in August.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe lists are not designed to track people who should not be officers. Rather they are a tool prosecutors use to identify those whose past conduct might raise questions about their fairness or truthfulness as a witness in a trial \u2013 and require disclosure to defendants.\n\nThe argument about maintaining the lists or making them public has led to political battles, especially in cities where newly elected prosecutors have made fighting police misconduct part of their platform.\n\nA training manual for Brady disclosure in the Philadelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office states that the general rule is \u201cDisclose. Disclose. Disclose.\u201d\n\nThe tack has put the prosecutor\u2019s office at war with the Philadelphia police union, which called the office\u2019s maintenance of a Brady list a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nIn Baltimore, State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby started forcing officers who could be witnesses to disclose their internal affairs investigations.\n\nMosby appointed a \u201ccriminal discovery liaison\u201d to review all court-related requests for officers\u2019 internal affairs information and send detailed records to prosecutors and other parties within 48 hours.\n\nMosby said the effort was necessary to increase trust and transparency in the city\u2019s criminal justice system after years of scandal around corrupt police units and the increased tension between residents and police since the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody in 2015.\n\nLast year, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office started reviewing court cases involving at least 25 Baltimore police officers because of misconduct charges against them.\n\nProsecutors recently began asking the courts to vacate nearly 800 convictions that involved testimony or investigations by these officers \u2013 and more could be coming as the office continues to gather information.\n\nMore than 530 Baltimore police officers have been added to an internal notification system, and defense attorneys are contacted if those officers are considered by prosecutors as witnesses. That list includes 183 officers who, because of their backgrounds, are automatically disclosed to the defense.\n\nFor Vara, who spent a decade behind bars for a crime he said he didn\u2019t commit, an easily available Brady list could have changed his life.\n\nAt the time of his trial, Houston police and the Harris County prosecutor\u2019s office were aware of Lindsey\u2019s history of misconduct. As part of its last investigation into Lindsey, the police department asked the prosecutor's office to charge him with a crime. The officer resigned rather than answer more questions \u2013 months before Vara's trial.\n\nVara\u2019s attorneys said the case boiled down to Lindsey\u2019s word against Vara\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThere's no breath test, no blood tests,\u201d said Celeste Blackburn, who represented Vara on appeal.\n\nBlackburn said Lindsey was the only police officer present that night to testify that Vara was drunk. In fact, court records indicate the other two officers said the smell of alcohol could have come from the passenger \u2013 a drunken buddy whom Vara had gone out that night to give a safe ride home.\n\nNeither Vara nor his defense lawyer knew about Lindsey\u2019s history at the time of trial.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy and it's scary how these guys got the power to change your life like that,\u201d Vara said. \u201cThe badge and that uniform gives them the power to do that.\u201d\n\nA police union attorney informed the Houston Police Department in 2006 that Lindsey would not respond to the allegations, department records show. At Vara's trial, Lindsey testified that he left law enforcement to pursue his love of teaching. He could not be reached for comment for this article.\n\nHow the system is supposed to work\n\nFor decades, U.S. courts have set a high standard for prosecutors when it comes to disclosing problems in police officers' pasts that might raise questions about their honesty and integrity as witnesses.\n\nBuilding on Brady vs. Maryland, a landmark case that exonerated a wrongfully convicted Maryland man, courts have repeatedly held that prosecutors must tell defendants what they know about law enforcement officers' backgrounds.\n\nIn a series of separate rulings, the Supreme Court has said that means prosecutors should know the backgrounds of the officers they rely on to put people in prison \u2013 and they must tell defendants what they know, whether they ask or not.\n\n\u201cSociety wins not only when the guilty are convicted, but when criminal trials are fair,\u201d Supreme Court Justice William Douglas wrote in the Brady decision.\n\nLegal scholars have generally interpreted the rulings as a requirement that prosecutors create a list of officers with credibility problems.\n\nBut there is no comprehensive rule for what kind of behavior lands an officer on a list and few repercussions for police and prosecutors who flout the requirement.\n\nAs a result, how the Brady disclosure rule is applied depends heavily on individual prosecutors in thousands of jurisdictions nationwide.\n\nSome prosecutors include only officers who have lied in court or falsified evidence. Others list those who have committed crimes, including drunken driving, or shown racial bias on the job. USA TODAY found wide variation in the level of documentation or investigation underlying officers' inclusion on the list. Some might have been convicted criminally or flagged by judges for lying in court. Others had been found guilty in internal investigations. And many have been accused of wrongdoing and their cases are pending. In some cases, prosecutors' lists don't even say why an officer's name is there.\n\nExplore: Search hundreds of prosecutors' responses to USA TODAY's questions about Brady lists\n\nSearch the answers of prosecutors who responded to USA TODAY.\n\nIn Miami-Dade County, internal training presentations obtained by USA TODAY show prosecutors being taught legal tactics to avoid disclosing officers\u2019 histories.\n\nThe documents say prosecutors don\u2019t have to go out of their way to disclose, and the burden of proving they covered up a questionable officer\u2019s history is on the defense.\n\nProsecutor training in Miami\n\nIn Miami-Dade County, internal training presentations obtained by USA TODAY show prosecutors being taught legal tactics to avoid disclosing officers\u2019 histories. The documents say the burden of proving they covered up a questionable officer\u2019s history is on the defense. The end of the slideshow casts disclosure as a game of strategy between prosecutors and the defense.\n\nRead document\n\n\u201cMere speculation by defense that information MAY be exculpatory is not enough to trigger state\u2019s obligation to disclose,\u201d the presentation states.\n\nThe end of the Miami training slideshow casts the strategy of hiding officer misconduct as a contest between prosecutors and the defense.\n\n\u201cYou were happily playing Scrabble ... but now you\u2019re playing Chess,\" one slide reads. \u201cTHAT\u2019S A GAME CHANGER, SON.\u201d\n\nEd Griffith, a spokesman for Katherine Fernandez Rundle, the elected state attorney in Miami-Dade County, contended the presentation does not provide instructions on avoiding disclosure of Brady material and said the chess game comparison in the slide was an attempt to \u201cadd a level of attention-getting levity to a very serious subject.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem with levity is that it does not always accomplish its intended goal,\u201d he said. \u201cThis appears to be one of those situations.\u201d\n\nBennett Gershman, a former prosecutor and now Pace Law School professor, said the courts have made it clear the burden is on prosecutors and leans heavily toward disclosure. Failing to disclose is not a game to be won, Gershman said, but a duty designed to protect the integrity of the court system.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dishonest if that\u2019s the way they\u2019re presenting the obligation of Brady,\u201d he said.\n\nGershman said the lack of tracking and policies about disclosing officers\u2019 misconduct is troubling because it\u2019s at the heart of the legal system\u2019s promise to provide every defendant a fair trial \u2013 a standard prosecutors are sworn to protect.\n\n\u201cIf you're putting a witness on the stand \u2013 whoever the witnesses, but particularly a police officer \u2013 and you have doubts about his credibility, doesn't that raise a question of whether you're prosecuting a guilty or an innocent person?\u201d Gershman asked.\n\nOfficers with misconduct in their past continue to testify\n\nUSA TODAY sought records and comments from nearly every state prosecutor in the country to compile the first national view of where Brady lists exist and don\u2019t.\n\nNearly half the prosecutorial districts that responded reported not keeping an official list. More than 1,000 did not respond to the requests at all.\n\nIn Chicago, the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney, the second biggest prosecutor\u2019s office in the country, said it does not keep a Brady list.\n\nInstead, the office sends individual memos to its prosecutors when it learns a police officer was convicted of a crime or was found by a judge to have lied under oath, telling them to avoid using the cops if possible or to notify defense attorneys. The system leaves individual prosecutors in the sprawling jurisdiction with America\u2019s second-largest police force on their own to track officers with credibility issues.\n\nShare your stories of police misconduct with us\n\nWe want to hear from you if you believe you\u2019ve encountered misconduct by a law enforcement officer or agency. You can send tips and records about an officer or agency to policetips@usatoday.com.\n\nEmail Us\n\nThe result: A USA TODAY analysis found that dozens of officers flagged by judges or convicted of crimes were summoned to testify at trial in recent years, with no assurance the defense was notified.\n\nIn at least four officers\u2019 cases, criminal court judges found the cops lied under oath during a trial. Court records show those four officers alone were listed as witnesses in at least 48 cases after prosecutors began receiving notices about them.\n\nOverall, officers who appeared in notification memos were called to testify in cases resulting in more than 100 felony convictions from 2013-2018.\n\nAcross the country, thousands of defendants have gone to trial with no clear way to know that law enforcement witnesses had a history of misconduct.\n\nMore: Fired for a felony, again for perjury. Meet the new police chief.\n\nDavid B. Green was among the officers who continued to patrol the streets despite a history of misconduct.\n\nIn 2011, Little Rock police suspended Green after he bashed a handcuffed suspect\u2019s face into the ground during an arrest, then lied about it.\n\nGreen claimed the suspect resisted him by trying to stand up during the encounter. A department review of body camera footage showed that the suspect didn\u2019t try to stand. Two other officers were holding the man down while Green beat him.\n\nGreen was suspended for 30 days for untruthfulness and excessive force. His personnel file includes at least 19 suspensions and reprimands for offenses including domestic violence, excessive force and neglect of duty.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: Help support quality journalism like this.\n\nGreen, who unsuccessfully appealed the charges against him, could not be reached for comment. In an interview conducted as part of an internal affairs investigation, Green did not deny the allegations against him but expressed dedication toward his job. \"Even though I get to work and I may not go home, I still love this job,\" he said. Department records show he is a military veteran and received commendations in 2000 and 2005 for taking lifesaving actions.\n\nUntil November 2015, Green continued to patrol Arkansas\u2019 largest city. His word was relied upon to arrest and help convict defendants.\n\nFormer Little Rock Police Chief Stuart Thomas disclosed in legal proceedings that his agency doesn\u2019t inform anyone at the courthouse about problems with his officers.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t maintain or forward a result of every disciplinary action to either the U.S. attorney or the state court,\u201d Thomas said in a deposition in 2013. \u201cI\u2019m not aware that we provide a list or a continuing update or anything like that.\u201d\n\nUSA TODAY reviewed discipline files for Little Rock police officers going back 15 years, then compared them with court records. The analysis found officers who the department determined lied or committed crimes were witnesses in at least 4,000 cases.\n\nOfficer Kenneth Thompson filed a report falsely claiming no one was injured after he knocked a suspect off his chair in 2005, despite video evidence to the contrary. He was suspended by the police department for 30 days. His sworn testimony has been used in at least 687 criminal cases since then.\n\nOfficers James Stanchak and Michael Terry were suspended in 2011 after they were caught on body camera video conspiring to lie about using force while arresting a man at a football game. Stanchak's sworn statements have since been used in 222 cases. Terry\u2019s have been used in four.\n\nOfficer Eugene Gray was suspended for 30 days in 2008 after he lied to internal affairs investigators about an off-duty arrest he never reported. During that arrest, he seized a cellphone that was never turned into the police department as evidence. Gray\u2019s word has been used in 256 prosecutions since 2009, court records show.\n\nPulaski County Chief Deputy Prosecutor John Johnson, whose office prosecutes cases in Little Rock, said the prosecutor's office handles cases properly when it is aware an officer participating in a criminal proceeding has been disciplined.\n\n\"When this office is made aware of disciplinary actions by an officer (and) they're going to testify as a witness,\" he said, \"we disclose that to the judge and let the judge make an independent finding as far as whether or not something is admissible pursuant to Brady.\"\n\nWrongful convictions\n\nFailing to disclose officers\u2019 past lies and bad acts can lead to wrongful convictions.\n\nSince 1988, data from the National Registry of Exonerations shows 987 people have been convicted, then exonerated in cases that involved a combination of official misconduct by prosecutors and perjury or a false report by police and other witnesses. They spent an average of 12 years each behind bars.\n\nThe registry shows a rapid increase in exonerations in such cases. There were 112 in 2018 stemming from government misconduct in the prosecution \u2013 up from 48 in 2008.\n\nAmong those wrongly imprisoned was Debra Milke.\n\nAfter returning from a trip to see Santa Claus at the Metrocenter mall in Phoenix, Milke\u2019s 4-year-old son, Christopher, asked her if he could go back.\n\nDebra Milke cries as she is embraced by Attorney Lori Voepel, right, during a news conference, March 24, 2015, Phoenix. Milke spoke out for the first time after spending two decades on death row in the killing of her son. In 2013, Milke was freed after 25 years in prison. More\n\nMilke sent Christopher back to the mall with a friend, James Styers, who drove him to a nearby ravine and shot him three times in the head.\n\nStyers and another man were convicted of the murder, but so was Milke, on the word of a Phoenix detective, Armando Saldate Jr., who interrogated Milke and concluded she plotted the killing.\n\nDuring Milke\u2019s trial, evidence was withheld from her and her attorneys: Saldate\u2019s police personnel file, which detailed eight cases in which indictments or convictions were thrown out because Saldate lied or otherwise violated a defendants\u2019 rights.\n\nIn 2013, Milke was freed after 25 years in prison.\n\nFor Revat Vara, the cost of 11 years behind bars has been heavy.\n\nVara\u2019s father died one week after his trial. His mother contracted leukemia while he was in prison, and he was unable to care for her. Two years after his release, he struggles to pick up his life.\n\n\u201cOnce the structure of the family goes ... pretty much everything starts falling apart,\u201d he said.\n\nRevat Vara, left, who spent 11 years in prison for a wrongful DWI conviction, speaks with his lawyer Maverick Ray, right, in Houston. Vara studied the law in prison as he worked with his legal team to win his release in 2017. More\n\nVara said he grew up in a low-income community in Houston, and his formal education ended at eighth grade. He made his living before his arrest working odd jobs in a convenience store and at a plant.\n\nOnce he found himself behind bars, Vara said, he began contacting attorneys to ask for help with an appeal.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t afford the legal help, but one lawyer sent him information about Lindsey\u2019s history of misconduct \u2013 which was well known among local defense attorneys.\n\nVara researched how to file legal appeals on his own.\n\n\u201cI knew I could never trust nobody again,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way that I'm going to do this is I got to study the law. I've got to get in that law library and fight for my freedom.\u201d\n\nVara said he spent two hours every day in the library. He was allowed a double session on Thursdays and Saturdays. He convinced one corrections officer to spend her lunch in the library to give him an extra hour.\n\nIt worked. But Vara is still trying to put his life back to together on the outside.\n\nStill living in Houston after his release from prison, Vara said he hopes to attend law school or start a nonprofit group to educate youth in his community about the law. He said he is not angry at the officer whose testimony put him in jail, but he is frustrated that the criminal justice system allowed the cop\u2019s misconduct to go on in secret for years.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Mr. Lindsey\u2019s fault, it was the public\u2019s fault,\u201d Vara said. \u201cMr. Lindsey was allowed to do what he did because they allowed him to do it.\u201d\n\nThe team behind this investigation\n\nREPORTING AND ANALYSIS: Mark Nichols, Eric Litke, James Pilcher, Aaron Hegarty, Andrew Ford, Brett Kelman, John Kelly, Matt Wynn, Steve Reilly, Megan Cassidy, Ryan Martin, Jonathan Anderson, Andrew Wolfson, Bethany Bruner, Benjamin Lanka, Gabriella Novello, Mark Hannan\n\nFROM THE INVISIBLE INSTITUTE: Sam Stecklow, Andrew Fan, Bocar Ba\n\nEDITING: Chris Davis, John Kelly, Brad Heath\n\nGRAPHICS AND ILLUSTRATIONS: Jim Sergent, Karl Gelles\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEOGRAPHY: Phil Didion, Christopher Powers, David Hamlin, Robert Lindeman\n\nDIGITAL PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT: Spencer Holladay, Annette Meade, Craig Johnson, Ryan Marx, Chris Amico, Josh Miller\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA, ENGAGEMENT AND PROMOTION: Anne Godlasky, Alia Dastagir, Felecia Wellington\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in this series\n\nFired for felony, then perjury.
