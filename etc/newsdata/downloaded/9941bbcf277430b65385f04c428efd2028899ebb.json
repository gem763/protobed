For example, on the page of Earl Shilton's instant access cash Isa, paying 1.15 per cent, the charges are not mentioned.\n\nUnder a section titled 'can I withdraw money', the building society only says 'yes \u2013 instant access'.\n\nThe fees are listed under a separate heading on the savings section of the society's website titled 'savings administration fees'.\n\nThis then gives you the link to the fees, which shows the withdrawal fees the society has charged for the last two years.\n\nThe building society does not reference it withdrawal fees on the pages of its savings products, instead it lists them in a document in a separate section of its website\n\nGiven how the cash Isa would pay you \u00a311.50 per year in interest on a balance of \u00a31,000, making a next-day transfer using Faster Payments from the account to your bank account would wipe out all but \u00a31.50 of that interest rate gain.\n\nIts instant access savings account pays even less at 0.25 per cent on balances up to \u00a310,000 and 0.3 per cent on balances between \u00a310,000 and \u00a3180,000.\n\nEarl Shilton defended the fees by pointing out that as it has not online withdrawal system for customers to use themselves, each payment out must be processed individually by a member of staff.\n\nA spokesman told This is Money: 'Faster Payments and CHAPS are processed individually and the respective charges reflect the reasonable time and effort of that processing together with the immediacy, or not, of the request, and finally the bank charges incurred by us from our clearing bank.'\n\nThe building society's clearing bank is taxpayer-owned high street giant NatWest.\n\nIt added: 'Faster payments are only permitted up to \u00a3250,000, as advised to us by our clearing bank. This accounts for payments over this sum being required to be sent by CHAPS.'", "description": "Leicestershire-based\u00a0Earl Shilton Building Society, which has 'over 10,000 members', does not allow users to transfer money out of its savings accounts online.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
