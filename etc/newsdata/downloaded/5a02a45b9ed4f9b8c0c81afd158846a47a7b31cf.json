Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), a House Oversight Committee member who chairs the subcommittee with jurisdiction over Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington. \u201cThat was the risk from day one \u2014 foreign governments and others trying to seek favor because we know Trump pays attention to this.... It\u2019s an obvious attempt to curry favor with him.\u201d\n\nThe investigation began after the committee received information that two entities \u2014 a trade association and a foreign government \u2014 booked a large quantity of rooms but only used a fraction of them, according to a person familiar with the allegation but isn't authorized to speak for the committee.\n\nThe so-called emoluments clause of the Constitution forbids Trump from profiting from foreign governments, or from receiving any money from the U.S. government aside from his annual salary.\n\nTrump has faced criticism for not fully separating from his namesake company after he was sworn into office.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, (D-Calif.), a member of the House Oversight Committee, said if Trump or his staff solicited the hotel reservations they could have broken the law. But even if they didn\u2019t, it\u2019s still a problem.\n\n\u201cIf true, at minimum this suggests there is a culture of corruption that the administration has created,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that to curry favor you have to engage in pay to play. That\u2019s exactly what the American people hate about Washington.\u201d\n\nConnolly confirmed that committee staff was investigating but said he didn\u2019t have the specific details of the allegations. The committee, White House and Trump\u2019s company, the Trump Organization, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied that he is using the presidency to promote his resorts. \u201cI have a lot of hotels all over the place, and people, they use them because they\u2019re the best,\u201d he told reporters last month.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi directed six committees, including Oversight, to continue their investigations as part of the impeachment inquiry and then send relevant cases to the Judiciary Committee.\n\nPelosi is considering narrowing the House inquiry to Trump's call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, but one lawmaker told POLITICO that even if it happens, she may quietly allow a couple other issues to be included. Those could include Trump illegally making money off his presidency and obstruction of justice in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election.\n\nTrump has admitted he asked Zelensky to look into whether former Vice President Joe Biden pressured Ukrainian officials to fire a prosecutor to quash a probe of Biden\u2019s son\u2019s company, but he insisted there was nothing wrong with what he did.\n\n\u201cThe unifying theme of congressional investigations is examining the president\u2019s abuse of his office and his power to advance his personal political agenda and his goal of financial self- enrichment,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the House Oversight Committee.\n\nTrump has faced criticism for not fully separating from his namesake company after he was sworn into office. The president still owns his business but placed his holdings in a trust designed to hold assets for his benefit. He can receive money from the trust at any time without the public\u2019s knowledge.\n\nLast month, the Oversight and Judiciary committees released letters they sent to the administration and Trump\u2019s company demanding details about both the president\u2019s call to host a G-7 summit at one of his Florida resorts as well as Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s recent stay at a Trump resort in Ireland.\n\nTrump's trips have led the Secret Service and other federal agencies to spend money at his properties.\n\nBut, according to people familiar with the congressional investigation, Oversight\u2019s inquiry goes beyond those two recent instances and into a broader look at other spending at Trump properties that could lead to conflicts of interest, a waste of U.S. taxpayer money and violations of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cPotential violations of the Foreign and Domestic Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution are of grave concern to the Committee as it considers whether to recommend articles of impeachment,\u201d wrote Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), chairman of the Oversight Committee and Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nTrump frequently visits his properties \u2014 primarily in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia \u2014 and has traveled to them more than 300 times since he was sworn into office, according to a compilation of information released by the White House. In 2017, he and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, a top presidential adviser, even made an unannounced stop at the Trump International Hotel Waikiki, staying for a few minutes to thank employees for their work.\n\nTrump's trips \u2014 and the regular visits by Pence and Trump\u2019s adult children \u2014 have led the Secret Service and other federal agencies to spend money at his properties.\n\nThe Air Force also acknowledged in September it has housed crews at Trump Turnberry in Scotland up to 40 times since 2015, and it's undertaking a broader review after POLITICO first reported the stays.\n\nNo single entity tracks how much the administration is spending at Trump properties, but it\u2019s likely well into the millions of dollars. Some federal agencies, including the Secret Service and the Air Force, have disclosed some documents in response to public records requests.\n\nPublic Citizen, a watchdog group, compiled a list of federal agencies, including the National Security Council and the General Services Administration, that had spent money at Trump properties in 2018. By that time, the Secret Service had already spent $64,090 at Trump businesses since 2015.\n\nTrump already faces lawsuits that he violated the Constitution by accepting payments from foreign officials at his resorts and hotels. His company donated nearly $200,000 to the U.S. Treasury in February that it says came from profits from foreign governments, but watchdog groups say the amount should be more.\n\nRevenue increased at many of the resorts Trump visited in 2018, including the Trump International Hotel in Washington, which has become a top destination for Republicans, according to Trump\u2019s most recent personal financial disclosure forms. That comes even as Trump\u2019s overall income dipped slightly from $450 million in 2017 to $434 million in 2018.\n\nSeveral House committees have pushed Trump to release his tax returns to learn more about his businesses, but he has refused to do so. The Trump Organization, comprising more than 500 businesses, is not required to publicly release financial information.", "description": "The House is investigating whether groups tried to curry favor with Trump by booking rooms at his hotels but never using them.", "authors": ["Anita Kumar", "Oma Seddiq", "Alex Isenstadt"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1148483127-1200x628.jpg"}
