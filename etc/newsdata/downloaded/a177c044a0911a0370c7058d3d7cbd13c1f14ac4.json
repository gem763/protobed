The Atkinsons got Addie, then a puppy, to comfort Jake and keep him company.\n\nthegoldensrule/Instagram\n\nAs Addie was growing up and learning the ropes from Jake, the two formed a close bond. And there are cute puppy videos to prove it!\n\nBut soon, the Atkinsons started noticing that something was wrong with Jake's eyes.\n\nWhen he first started experiencing symptoms, \u201cAddie would go up to his eyes and try to start licking his eyes,\" Kim Atkinson recalls.\n\nthegoldensrule/Instagram\n\nAfter months of treatment and vet visits, they realized Jake was no longer able to produce tears and would have to get his eyes removed. If not, they'd have to put him down.\n\n\u201cWe were very concerned about it, because it just seemed so barbaric to have your dog's eyes removed,\u201d Kim Atkinson said. But after hearing from other dog owners who had been through similar procedures, they realized it was the best way to ensure Jake could live pain-free.\n\n\u201cHe must\u2019ve been so miserable ... he had them removed, he was just a happy dog again. The vet said he was wagging his tail when he woke up from the surgery,\u201d Kim Atkinson told \"GMA.\"\n\nAfter he came home, Addie was so excited to see her brother again. She stayed close to him and he turned to her for cues on how to get around.\n\n\"For a really long time afterwards, she was always really close to him...He had to map out our house again, and learn where things were.\" Kim Atkinson said.\n\nWhen Kim and her husband Joe would try to coax Jake down the stairs, he was not able to do it, so Addie would come halfway up the stairs to show him how to get down.\n\nthegoldensrule/Instagram\n\n\"What Joe and I would do wouldn't have the same effect as if Addie did that, kind of encouraging him.\"\n\nJake has learned a lot from Addie since he lost his sight, so much so that he's able to run around in open spaces and play just like he used to.\n\nBut when the family goes on trips and to new environments, he definitely still relies a lot on his little sister.\n\n\"They snuggle up close together and just love being together.\"\n\nAs for if Addie is officially Jake's seeing eye dog, Joe Atkinson doesn't think so. \"I think people try to give her superpowers, but it's a lot more simple than that,\" he said. \"I think their story is about just being there for each other and that it can make the difference.\"", "description": "After golden retriever Jake lost his eyes, a puppy named Addie was there for him, helping guide him through life.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/jake-addie-ht-jt-191015_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
