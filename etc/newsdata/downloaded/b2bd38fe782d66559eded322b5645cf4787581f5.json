As impeachment clouds gather, his position seems in peril\n\nMike Pence, meet Dan Quayle.\n\nCrossfire Hurricane review: tale of Trump and the FBI is a gas gas gas Read more\n\nLike Pence, Quayle hailed from Indiana and feared being dumped by a president whose re-election seemed uncertain. In Quayle\u2019s case, George HW Bush calculated that the cost of unloading his gaffe-prone and draft-avoiding veep outweighed any potential advantage. Quayle kept his spot. Bush lost to Bill Clinton.\n\nPence\u2019s prospects appear similarly shaky. With Trump trailing in the polls \u2013 and facing impeachment \u2013 reports are rife of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump seeking to drop Pence for Nikki Haley, a former South Carolina governor and ambassador to the United Nations. Pence\u2019s beatific gaze at his boss, coupled with his evident discomfort with modernity, have left him vulnerable to media mockery as well as presidential whim.\n\nTom LoBianco is the latest author to attempt to fill in the blanks on the canvas that is the vice-president. Unlike some Pence books, the result is neither hit job nor hagiography. Rather, the veteran Pence-watcher portrays his subject as a committed Christian with sharp elbows and a sonorous voice, one who has struggled with the tugs of faith and ambition, his sensibilities now dulled by baptism in Trump\u2019s swamp.\n\n\u201cThe man with stark principles kept slipping away, clouded by his ambition and political maneuvering,\u201d LoBianco writes. But \u201cTrump only made Pence\u2019s machinations more obvious to those who had watched for decades\u201d. For the biblically minded, Jacob\u2019s sojourn in the house of Laban, his corrupt father-in-law, gives steadfastness a better name than the current VP.\n\nPence refused to be interviewed by LoBianco. But those in his orbit provide useful context in assessing a man whose time as governor of Indiana was filled with more than a fair share of debacles but who wound up on a winning national ticket.\n\nPence owes much to the fusion of evangelical Protestantism to unvarnished capitalism and the spirit of the Tea Party\n\nHe made a hash of the state\u2019s Religious Freedoms Restoration Act, which would have prohibited a \u201cgovernmental entity from substantially burdening a person\u2019s exercise of religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability\u201d.\n\nDespite Pence\u2019s denials, the law was instantly viewed as an invitation to discriminate against gays and lesbians. Pence capitulated and signed remedial legislation, but only after receiving a drubbing at the hands of ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos \u2013 a Rhodes scholar, holder of an Oxford degree in theology, son of a Greek Orthodox priest.\n\nPence\u2019s political existence owes much to the fusion of evangelical Protestantism to unvarnished capitalism and the spirit of the Tea party. While seeking divine guidance, he has kept at least one eye on the Koch brothers\u2019 munificence, broader cultural resentments and demographic upheaval.\n\nBack in 1992, when Bush and Quayle were primed for defeat, Pence was thinking kindly of Pat Buchanan, the Nixon speechwriter and paleo-conservative who challenged Bush for the nomination. Buchanan\u2019s ideological heir now lives in the White House, Pence striving to stay by his side.\n\nLoBianco also writes of the Pence and his wife Karen, the spouse he calls \u201cmother\u201d, and their time in the Indiana statehouse. They would spend the day talking on the phone, even as she maintained a nearby office, in order to avoid prying eyes. According to LoBianco, it was Karen, not Mike, who was the \u201cnew sheriff in town\u201d.\n\nPiety and Power describes an exchange between Trump and Pence in which the candidate tells his prospective running mate he wants a \u201ckiller\u201d on his ticket, and cites Chris Christie as a prime example. Pence did not rise to the bait, reportedly responding that if Trump truly wished for a \u201cconstant attack dog, I suggest that you go find someone else\u201d. But if Trump wanted a vice-president \u201cto help get bills passed through Congress\u201d, then Pence was his \u201cguy\u201d.\n\nPence is in the middle of Trump\u2019s efforts to shake down Ukraine in exchange for lowering the boom on the Bidens\n\nReally? Pence stood helplessly on the Senate floor as the late John McCain torched the attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, after Pence had \u201cconsistently reassured\u201d the president \u201cthat they would have the votes needed to do away\u201d with Obamacare.\n\nPence also verged on the irrelevant to the president\u2019s signature achievement, the 2017 tax cut. Pence played cheerleader but the plays were called by Republican congressional leaders and the gods of industry.\n\nPence lacks the impact he had on the campaign trail. His advice is not in demand. Trump has forged his own bonds with the religious right. The distance between Trump, Stormy Daniels, Jerry Falwell Jr and his pool boy is about a hair\u2019s breadth. Figuratively, if not literally.\n\nKaren Pence remarked in October 2015, \u201cWe knew what we were signing up for.\u201d Really?\n\nWhat Pence does do well is swallow his pride and raise money. In contrast to Trump, who hates schmoozing and schnoring, \u201cdonors loved talking with Pence and he loved listening\u201d. But Pence could and did go \u201ctoo far\u201d. His standard $75,000-per-person ask for lunches and dinners in \u201csmall settings\u201d triggered Trump. For all of Pence\u2019s obsequiousness, Trump came to question his loyalty.\n\nCall Sign Chaos review: James Mattis pulls a flanking manuever on Trump Read more\n\nUnfortunately, Pence now finds himself in the middle of Trump\u2019s efforts to shake down Ukraine in exchange for lowering the boom on the Bidens. This is what the brass ring can look like.\n\nPence\u2019s journey, and to a lesser degree LoBianco\u2019s book, reflect the dilemma faced by faith communities at a time when religious \u201cnones\u201d are a growing part of the population, organized religion is mired in scandal and mainline Protestantism, the creed of the Founding Fathers, has ceded its sway.\n\nAs Ted Cruz, a preacher\u2019s son, learned in the 2016 Republican primaries, the heart of political evangelism lies not in the pews but at Daytona and Talladega, the cathedrals of Nascar. American evangelism has evolved into caffeinated American nationalism, white identity lurking near the surface.\n\nThe spirit of Protestant dissent, which fueled rebellion against the crown, has given way to declaring that Trump is God\u2019s anointed. Franklin Graham, the late Billy Graham\u2019s son, threatened Americans with heaven\u2019s wrath if they had the temerity to criticize the president: \u201cThe Bible says it is appointed unto man once to die and then the judgment.\u201d Piety and Power is an American tale.", "description": "The VP brought the evangelicals to the table but not much else.
