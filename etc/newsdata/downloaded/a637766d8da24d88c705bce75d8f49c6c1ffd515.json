I did play against them in the Sevens back in the day but I'm looking forward to the opportunity,\" added the 33-year-old, whose family emigrated to Canada when he was a teenager.\n\nMeanwhile van der Merwe was in no doubt of the challenge posed by the Springboks.\n\n\"They have got a physical pack that's complemented with a real speedy backline,\" he said.\n\n\"For us it's a great opportunity just to measure ourselves against one of the best teams in the world.\"\n\nVan der Merwe will be playing in his 15th World Cup match, a record for a Canadian.\n\nHe now has the chance to become just the fifth player after Samoa's Brian Lima, Ireland's Brian O'Driscoll, Wales's Gareth Thomas and Australia's Adam Ashley-Cooper to score a try at four different World Cups, although the modest van der Merwe said Tuesday's game was \"not about me\".\n\nCanada, who will have a new front row, play South Africa just six days after suffering a 63-0 thrashing by reigning champions New Zealand in the most lop-sided result of this tournament so far.\n\nFacing the rugby union superpowers in quick succession would be a daunting challenge even for any side, let alone Canada, as their performance manager, Huw Wiltshire, admitted.\n\n\"For any Tier One nation playing the All Blacks and the Springboks in one week is a challenge,\" he said, with Canada eyeing a win against fellow minnows Namibia in their final pool match.\n\n\"I've done that with Wales and I know from personal experience it takes a toll on the players.\"\n\nCanada great Gareth Rees, sent off in a 20-0 loss to eventual champions South Africa in the infamous 'Battle of Boet Erasmus' at the 1995 World Cup, said the current side had made Canadians \"proud of the jersey\" at this edition.\n\nBut he lamented that matches against the likes of New Zealand and South Africa were \"unfortunately all too rare\" for Canada.\n\nTeams:\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Damian Willemse, 14 Warrick Gelant, 13 Damian de Allende, 12 Frans Steyn, 11 Sbu Nkosi, 10 Elton Jantjies, 9 Cobus Reinach, 8 Francois Louw, 7 Kwagga Smith, 6 Siya Kolisi, 5 Franco Mostert, 4 RG Snyman, 3 Vincent Koch, 2 Schalk Brits, 1 Thomas du Toit\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Frans Malherbe, 19 Eben Etzebeth, 20 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 21 Herschel Jantjies, 22 Handre Pollard, 23 Willie le Roux\n\nCanada\n\n15 Andrew Coe; 14 Jeff Hassler, 13 Conor Trainor, 12 Ciaran Hearn, 11 DTH van der Merwe; 10 Peter Nelson, 9 Phil Mack; 8 Tyler Ardron (captain), 7 Matt Heaton, 6 Lucas Rumball; 5 Kyle Baillie, 4 Evan Olmstead; 3 Jake Ilnicki, 2 Andrew Quattrin, 1 Hubert Buydens\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Benoit Piffero, 17 Djustice Sears-Duru, 18 Matt Tierney, 19 Josh Larsen, 20 Michael Sheppard, 21 Jamie Mackenzie, 22 Shane O'Leary, 23 Guiseppe du Toit", "description": "Canada star DTH van der Merwe is relishing the prospect of finally facing his native South Africa in 15-a-side action when the countries meet at the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7887/886ab10dec4b44a5b781074cc4c3da62.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
