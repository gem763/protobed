The British couple detained are not pictured here\n\nA British couple say they have been detained in the US after accidentally crossing the border from Canada.\n\nDavid and Elaine Connors say they are being held in Pennsylvania with their three-month-old baby - which has left them \"traumatised\".\n\nThey say were driving with relatives on 3 October when, to avoid an animal, they veered into an unmarked lane.\n\nA police officer then pulled them over, told them they were in the US state of Washington and arrested them.\n\nThe couple have detailed the \"scariest experience of our entire lives\" in a sworn statement that was provided to BBC News by their lawyer.\n\nThe family statement is the basis for a legal complaint lodged by their lawyer with the US Department of Homeland Security inspector general.\n\nUS immigration authorities confirmed to the BBC that the couple were being held, but denied their allegations of mistreatment.\n\nWhere were they taken?\n\nThe family's attorney, Bridget Cambria, of Aldea - the People's Justice Center, said the couple were driving in the Vancouver area on 3 October when they took a detour to avoid an animal on the road.\n\nThe family say they did not realise they had strayed over the US border.\n\nThey were pulled over by a police officer who did not read them their rights, nor allow them to \"simply turn around\" and go back to Canada, according to the complaint.\n\nAt first the young family say they were separated - first with Mr Connors, 30, in a male-only cell, and his 24-year-old wife and infant son in a women's cell.\n\nLater, Mr Connors was taken to a detention centre in Tacoma, Washington, while Mrs Connors and their son were taken to a budget hotel near Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, according to the complaint.\n\nThe following morning they say they were driven to the airport, which raised their hopes that they were being flown back to Canada or the UK.\n\n\"But that was not the case,\" Mrs Connors says in the sworn statement. Instead, they were flown to Pennsylvania - on the other side of the country.\n\nThey were taken on 5 October to Berks Family Residential Center (BFRC), one of three immigration detention centres in the US that can accommodate families.\n\nMrs Connors says: \"We will be traumatised for the rest of our lives by what the United States government has done to us.\"\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirmed the Connorses were in detention at the BFRC facility in Leesport, Pennsylvania.\n\nA spokesman for the agency told the BBC that BFRC \"provides a safe and humane environment for families as they go through the immigration process\".\n\n\"Reports of abuse or inhumane conditions at BFRC are unequivocally false,\" he added.\n\n'The worst experience'\n\nThe Connorses' sworn statement says the cells are \"frigid\", and staff have refused to turn the heating on until the end of next month.\n\n\"When I ask how I am supposed to keep my baby warm in this horrible cold, all they tell me is to put a hat on him,\" Mrs Connors said in the statement.\n\n\"My baby can't wear a hat all the time, he feels uncomfortable with hats and mittens and starts to cry.\"\n\nStaff, she added, confiscated her son's formula for three days, as well as his teething powder, and would only provide \"disgusting\" blankets that smell \"like a dead dog\".\n\nThey say the baby's skin is now rough and blotchy and he appears to have an eye infection.\n\n\"We have been treated like criminals here, stripped of our rights, and lied to,\" she said. \"It is not right.\n\n\"We have been treated unfairly from day one. It is undoubtedly the worst experience we have ever lived through.\n\n\"We have been traumatised and it has even damaged our relationship. No one should have to suffer this kind of treatment.\"", "description": "The young couple are being held in an immigration centre with their three-month-old baby.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4D83/production/_109234891_gettyimages-1155463883.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
