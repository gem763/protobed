He attacked me several times and was convicted three times for assault, but I always went back.\n\n\u201cHe told me what to wear and how to behave. If we didn\u2019t have sex every day, he would accuse me of cheating on him.\n\n\u201cAfter our first daughter was born, I went on the contraceptive pill but Jamie went mad. He said he wanted more kids and so I had to come off it.\n\n\u201cWhen I went into labour, I asked him to take me to hospital, but he said we had no food and he made me do an Iceland shop first.\n\n(Image: FOCUS FEATURES)\n\n\u201cWhen I look back, I can\u2019t believe the way he controlled me and made me so miserable. My message to other women is walk away \u2013 and stay away.\u201d\n\nLaura was just 17 when she met McKinlay, who was seven years older than her, and quickly fell under his spell.\n\nShe said: \"I bumped into him a few times in the corner shop. He was very attractive, he worked out a lot.\n\n\"He was much older and so I looked up to him \u2013 I did as he said.\u201d\n\nTheir relationship moved quickly and just two weeks after they met McKinlay had Laura's name tattooed on her chest.\n\n(Image: FOCUS FEATURES)\n\nHe then asked her to move in with him.\n\nLaura said: \"I was very young, and I felt flattered. He was very intense. He would insist on sitting next to me all the time on the couch, I wasn\u2019t even allowed to sit on my own.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t like me going anywhere without him. I couldn\u2019t send a text without him checking it first.\n\n\u201cWe had to have sex daily \u2013 sometimes twice a day \u2013 or he\u2019d accuse me of cheating. It was draining, physically and emotionally.\u201d\n\nIn July 2010, McKinlay was jailed for six months for assaulting Laura but she took him back after her pleaded for forgiveness.\n\n(Image: FOCUS FEATURES)\n\nIn May 2011, their first daughter was born, and struggling to cope, Laura went on the pill.\n\nShe said: \"I didn\u2019t want any more children with him, I was making plans to get away.\n\n\"But he went crazy when he found out I was taking contraception because he wanted to me to have loads of kids so he could control me.\n\n\u201cI had to take it \u2013 I had no choice.\u201d\n\nJust over a year later, in June 2012, she gave birth to their second daughter.\n\nLaura said: \"I had a check-up with my midwife, and she said my labour was starting and to pack my bag and get to the hospital.\n\n(Image: FOCUS FEATURES)\n\n\u201cI cleaned the house, got my sister to look after my daughter, and asked Jamie to take me to hospital.\n\n\u201cBut he refused, because we had no food in. He made me do a big shop at Iceland and by the time I had finished \u2013 and put the shopping away \u2013 I was in agony.\n\n\u201cHe was sorting out his golf clubs, like there was no problem.\n\n\u201cI got to hospital and I was already 7cms dilated. Jamie started shouting: \u2018It doesn\u2019t take anyone else this long to give birth\u2019 and he stormed off the labour ward.\n\n\u201cTwenty minutes later, our daughter was born.\u201d\n\nMcKinlay was handed a two-year suspended sentence for assault but Laura took him back for a second time, admitting she was \"infatuated with him\".\n\n(Image: FOCUS FEATURES)\n\nShe added: \"I had got to the stage where I felt I couldn\u2019t cope without him. He made me feel that I needed him.\"\n\nIn May 2014 McKinlay served 20 weeks on remand for assault and Laura had a third child, a boy, the following year.\n\nBut the turning point came at the end of 2015 when Laura was brave enough to finally walk away for good.\n\nMcKinlay was later sentenced to two years in jail for breach of a restraining order.\n\nThe judge said that he was \u2018utterly controlling\u2019 and that Laura was \u2018immensely vulnerable.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u201cHe had her over a barrel and could do whatever he wanted.\u201d\n\nPreston Crown Court heard McKinlay had a 46 offences on his record, including a number for violence and harassment.\n\nLaura said: \u201cThat was the end for me. I found the strength to stand up to him, for my sake and for my children.\u201d\n\nShe has since met a new partner and they have a son, two, and baby daughter together.", "description": "Laura Wallis also had to have sex with Jamie McKinlay at least once a day and was even screamed at for \"taking too long to give birth\"", "authors": ["Ann Cusack", "Jane Lavender", "Image", "Focus Features"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20715556.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-THP_CHP_241019SLUG_7005JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
