It\u2019s good, but it\u2019s Zellweger that\u2019s great.\n\nJust when we might have been writing Ren\u00e9e Zellweger off as a fading has-been, the Chicago star comes storming back with a performance that may just land her a fourth Oscar nomination\n\nStructurally, it\u2019s similar to both My Week With Marilyn and Stan & Ollie, in that all three take a famous American star and revisit an often short period when Britain played a small but important role in their lives.\n\nWith My Week With Marilyn, it was Marilyn Monroe\u2019s troubled time here as she filmed The Prince And The Showgirl with Laurence Olivier. With Stan & Ollie \u2013 a film that Judy resembles very strongly indeed \u2013 it was a final theatre tour of Britain the comedy duo embarked on in a doomed attempt to revive their film careers.\n\nAnd with Judy it\u2019s a troubled cabaret season at London\u2019s Talk Of The Town, which Garland took on in a desperate attempt to restore her wretched finances. Barely six months later she would be dead.\n\nRupert Goold's film is centred on Judy Garland's troubled cabaret season in London shortly before her death. Above: Zellweger with Finn Wittrock as Garland\u2019s 5th husband, Mickey Deans\n\nZellweger, who\u2019s a good match for Garland in so many ways (age, size and apparent fragility), gives it everything she\u2019s got to convince as the deeply troubled singer. She\u2019s twitchy, nervous, wide-eyed \u2013 to some extent it\u2019s a masterclass in conveying vulnerability and desperation.\n\nBut it\u2019s a little one-note \u2013 sometimes rather lacking in light and shade, at others just a little too much. Once or twice I thought I spotted the briefest glimpse of Julie Walters\u2019s great comic creation, Mrs Overall, the tremulous caricature she once dreamt up with Victoria Wood.\n\nBut for the most part this is a deeply moving, pathos-packed performance that reminds you how good Zellweger can be.\n\nGoold is best-known as a theatre director and Judy, for all its qualities, isn't quite cinematic enough. A great Zellweger apart, it's all just a little small and contrived\n\nThe film is adapted from Peter Quilter\u2019s stage play End Of The Rainbow, and directed by Rupert Goold, the British director far better known for his many theatre productions than his, to date, modest film work.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be fair to say that its theatrical origins are obvious, but it would be fair to describe it as a film that \u2013 for all its qualities \u2013 isn\u2019t quite cinematic enough. Zellweger apart, it\u2019s all just a little small and contrived.\n\nGarland\u2019s troubled childhood and teenage years are beautifully established, however, through a series of flashbacks to the late Thirties, when she was under contract to MGM, run then by the bullying and intimidating Louis B Mayer (played here with suitable menace and looming physical presence by Richard Cordery).\n\nIT'S A FACT On the day that Judy Garland died, a tremendous tornado tore through Kansas, where Dorothy was once blown away to Oz.\n\nIn scenes that suggest there is nothing new about #MeToo abuse, the young British actress Darci Shaw is terrific as the younger Garland, who, as she makes the transition to womanhood, is told what she can eat (the studio throws a 16th-birthday party for her with a cake they forbid her to eat), is force-fed with Benzedrine diet pills, and is then given sleeping pills when she understandably can\u2019t sleep. Thirty years later it was a similar toxic cocktail that would accidentally claim her life.\n\nMusically, the first half of the film is a subdued affair, as Goold concentrates on establishing Garland\u2019s situation \u2013 broke, lonely, vulnerable and, eventually, even deprived of her children.\n\nBut he more than makes up for that as the action moves to London, the sequin-clad showgirls kick up their heels, and Garland \u2013 after a considerable case of nerves \u2013 finally takes to the stage.\n\nGoold slightly overcooks the big emotional climax but Zellweger can certainly belt out a tune, and with Over The Rainbow clearly on its way, we know we\u2019re definitely not in Kansas any more. Or anywhere near a happy ending come to that.\n\nALSO OUT THIS WEEK\n\nJoker Cert: 15, 2hrs 1min\n\nRating:\n\nFor one extraordinary moment in Joker, Joaquin Phoenix looks so like the late Heath Ledger that it takes your breath away, as the baton is symbolically passed from one great portrayal of Batman\u2019s arch enemy to another.\n\nLedger, of course, won a posthumous Oscar for his performance in The Dark Knight in 2009, and no one would surely bet against Phoenix picking up a golden statuette in person next year.\n\nThe only difference would be that Phoenix would be accepting the Best Actor Oscar rather than the Best Supporting Actor award, because this is a film that not only invites us to feel sorry for the Joker but places him absolutely centre-stage. Batman, even in the shape of a still-schoolboy Bruce Wayne, barely gets a look-in.\n\nNo one would surely bet against Joaquin Phoenix picking up the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Batman's arch enemy, Joker; his performance is spot-on and a tour de force\n\nInstead, Todd Phillips, hitherto best known for directing the Hangover films, focuses his camera and co-writing responsibilities on Arthur Fleck, a lonely man in early middle age who still lives with his mother, scrapes a white-faced living as a not-very-funny clown and nurses deluded dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian.\n\nThe fact that he has a mental illness that causes him to laugh maniacally at the most inappropriate moments is going to do nothing to help that ambition or lessen his mounting sense of social isolation.\n\nHe has been in and out of institutions from an early age, and we soon get the firm impression that a tough Gotham City is not going to accommodate someone as odd as Arthur. Unless, of course, something snaps inside his head \u2013 or he comes off his medication.\n\nWith Robert De Niro leading the supporting cast, comparisons with the films of Martin Scorsese are inevitable with both Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy coming to mind\n\nPhoenix, an actor capable of overcooking a performance, gets it spot-on, delivering a tour de force. Yes, he\u2019s eventually overindulged a little and, yes, the film is probably ten minutes too long. It\u2019s also noticeably short on action, although be warned, when it does come it\u2019s as nasty as anything in The Dark Knight.\n\nWith Robert De Niro leading the supporting cast as Arthur\u2019s favourite chat-show host, comparisons with the films of Martin Scorsese are inevitable. Both Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy come to mind in a film that is beautifully made but empathises so wholeheartedly with the loner who eventually picks up a gun \u2013 so often a real-life nightmare in modern-day America \u2013 that it\u2019s possible to be both very impressed and deeply disturbed at the same time.", "description": "Bridget Jones's Baby apart, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger has been missing from British cinema screens for nearly a decade, the handful of films she has made apparently not meriting a release here.", "authors": ["Matthew Bond For Event Magazine"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/15/19257456-0-image-a-2_1570113213732.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
