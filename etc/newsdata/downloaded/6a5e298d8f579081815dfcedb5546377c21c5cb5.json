Roughly half ends up in landfills.\n\nUK company Powerhouse Energy wants to turn this plastic deluge into an opportunity by producing energy from non-recyclable plastics and other waste.\n\nPowerhouse Energy has developed a process where it shreds the waste and then heats it to around 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit to produce syngas \u2014 a mixture of hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide. Syngas can either be burned to produce electricity, or the hydrogen can be separated out to power fuel cells in vehicles.\n\nHydrogen fuel cell vehicles are powered by electric motors, but instead of carrying their energy in a battery pack, they create electricity by combining hydrogen with oxygen from the air in a fuel cell. Water vapor and heat are the only byproducts at the tailpipe.\n\nHydrogen cars have two big advantages over battery-powered electric vehicles: they can usually drive farther before needing to refuel, and refueling takes only a few minutes, not the hours it can take to charge an electric battery.\n\nRead More", "description": "A UK company is using non-recyclable plastics and other waste to generate electricty and hyrdogen.", "authors": ["Anna Fletcher", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191002135402-econundrum-powerhouse-plastics-00004429-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
