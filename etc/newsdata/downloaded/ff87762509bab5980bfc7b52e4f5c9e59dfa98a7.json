But Eric Adams says the solution is a solution. More specifically, an alcohol and vinegar solution.\n\nAdams is the borough president of Brooklyn. He just unveiled a new bucket-sized trap called the Ekomille that lures, traps and drowns the rodents in a brine-like mixture.\n\nAs It Happens host Carol Off spoke to Adams about the new trap and whether it might be a more effective and humane way to control the burgeoning rat population in the city. Here is part of their conversation.\n\nEric, first of all, just how bad is the rat problem in New York these days?\n\nIt is at a crisis level. We are experiencing a substantial increase in the rat population.\n\nAnd sometimes people don't understand the significant diminishment of quality of life when you're dealing with rats.\n\nI always remember when I was a child, my neighbour had a baby. After the baby vomited a little overnight, she woke up hearing her baby scream. There was a rat gnawing at her mouth from the vomit.\n\nYou never lose sight of that. And it really impacts the quality of life of everyday people when you have a rat-infested building or a block.\n\nAdams says the rat population is so high partly because of development in the city that pushes rats from their burrows.

I still think about it from when I was seven years old.\n\nSo you could only imagine if every day you open a cabinet and rats jump out. It's traumatizing.\n\nNow, I want to ask you about this latest device, this rat trap. How does it work?\n\nIt's a very interesting device.\n\nWe're spending $32 million [US] on rat mitigation annually.\n\nWe use everything from the dry ice, to poison, to the black boxes where rats go inside \u2014 and even, almost $5.6 million we spent on mint-scented bags. All of these devices and items are unsuccessful.\n\nAnd so I wanted to search far and wide and find out: are there new methods of dealing with an old problem?\n\nAnd we were able to discover that this new device, which is environmentally friendly, humane, and it could hold up to 80 rats.\n\nWhat happens is you put it out one day to get the rats used to eating the food. And once they follow that trail, they're creatures of habit.\n\nIt's a small little flip contraption that when they step on a contraption they fall down into a solution that's made out of alcohol and vinegar and they drown in that solution.\n\nThe Ekomille trap lures rats into a solution of alcohol and vinegar. (Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSo they're landing in this fluid. Is it like they're pickled in this stuff?\n\nYes. It's a sealed canister. The device is no larger than probably three inches in height and 2 \u00bd inches in width.\n\nWhen we showed this off last week, we had up to 107 in one location of Brooklyn Borough Hall.\n\nAnd we were seeing rats every day. Rats going through the trash, hiding under cars, running over the feet of people. It became really a rat-infested location. And this really resolved that problem.\n\nAdams says using more traditional methods like rat poison is dangerous to other wildlife. (Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nNow, you mentioned, not that many people care about what happens to rats, but you said it was humane. How is this humane?\n\nWell, there's several ways we deal with rats now in the city. One, you can use a poison. That takes days before the poison takes effect. The rat goes through a great deal of suffering. ... And it also leaves a dead rodent where birds and other animals can also have cross-contamination.\n\nYou can use a trap that would break the neck or the body. A very painful encounter. It could take a great deal of time before they die.\n\n[With] this contraption, within seconds, the rat drowns. It doesn't bring the same level of torture that poison and other methods that have been used in the past.\n\nIn the pilot project for the new trap, Adams says dozens of rats were caught and killed over the course of a month. (Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nJust because it speaks to how large the rats are in New York, one of them was so big that it actually broke the device. Right?\n\nYes. And that was a rarity. It probably was a king rat. And king rats normally lead their colonies. It was a very large rat and it actually broke the flipper part of it, which is not a major issue. You can replace the top unit.\n\nSomebody mentioned that if you are actually able to reduce the rat population significantly, it actually might even have the opposite effect because then the rats don't have as much competition for food and then their population explodes again. Is that is that a concern?\n\nI haven't heard that.\n\nBut right now, I have an urgency that I must address and it would be irresponsible that I would ignore the cries of the public who are really traumatized by the number of rodents that are impacting the quality of their lives.\n\nAnd if we don't do something to get it under control, we're not only going to need a borough president, we're going to need a Pied Piper.\n\nWritten by Morgan Passi and John McGill.
