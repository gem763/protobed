We\u2019ve already seen them make corrections after omitting key details about a supposed witness. They also reported an allegation without bothering to note that the alleged victim doesn\u2019t even have memory of it happening. In other words, they ran a rehash of discredited accusations from Debra Ramirez while tacking on an even less credible, third hand claim from Bill Clinton\u2019s former lawyer.\n\nSeems legit.\n\nNow, we are starting to find out just how biased the Times was being in their reporting of this story. CBS News went on record late last night with a major revelation that further destroys Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s allegations against Kavanaugh. Note that Mollie Hemingway put this in her book way back in July as well. She deserves the primary credit.\n\nWe report tonight the real bombshell: Christine Ford\u2019s close HS friend (who Ford says was at the party when Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her) said Ford\u2019s story is not believable and told the FBI Ford\u2019s allies pressured her, threatened her with a smear campaign to say otherwise https://t.co/GQhBTXHcze \u2014 Jan Crawford (@JanCBS) September 17, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s pretty big news as it turns Ford\u2019s claim on its head. Not only did her \u201cwitness\u201d not recall the incident, she didn\u2019t feel it was believable. Worse, Ford\u2019s allies stepped in to try to pressure her to change her story to help complete the take down of Kavanaugh.\n\nFord, her lawyers, and the Democrats who facilitated the smear were acting with no regards for truth or ethics. They had one goal and that was to blow up Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. It\u2019s troubling to think of just how close they claim to succeeding.\n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker. After CBS reported that, the Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman decided to jump on Twitter and snark that they had the information too.\n\nthat information was also said to the same NYT reporters https://t.co/86yArtDf96 \u2014 Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) September 17, 2019\n\nWell, ok then Maggie. Why wasn\u2019t it reported?\n\nWeird that it was in their book but left out of their big article! https://t.co/cmckcusZL2 \u2014 Peter J. Hasson (@peterjhasson) September 17, 2019\n\nlove to act indignant when a competing newsroom exercises better editorial judgment \u2014 T. Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) September 17, 2019\n\nEven though the information was in the book itself, which the article in question was based on, the \u201creporters\u201d minimized it and presented a different picture anyway.\n\nNot just downplayed, but dismissed in favor of their \"gut\" feeling that the incident with no evidence happened. \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 17, 2019\n\nTo summarize, the Times had information that Ford\u2019s account was essentially nuked and discredited. Instead of running that as the lead story delved from this garbage book, they reran old allegations and included a new one which lacked any credibility at all, to the point where even the alleged victim has no recollection of it.\n\n\u201cJournalism.\u201d\n\nAre we supposed to believe that was just an honest editorial decision? Come on. The authors of this book were so partisan, so wrapped up in their own narrative that they did everything they could to frame things in a way to hurt Kavanaugh. It just so happens that they did such an awful job at it that their claims fell apart within hours.\n\nThe Times has no credibility left. I\u2019m tired of some on the right insisting we can\u2019t just dump these outlets wholesale. What have they done to earn anyone\u2019s trust at this point? Let this also be a reminder of just how far the left and their enablers in the media are willing to go to take down Republican interests. There are no lines they won\u2019t cross and this was just a preview of what we are going to see in 2020. You can bet they\u2019ve got a whole (new) dossier cooked up to run against Trump and the press will be right there to dutifully regurgitate the talking points without questioning their validity.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
