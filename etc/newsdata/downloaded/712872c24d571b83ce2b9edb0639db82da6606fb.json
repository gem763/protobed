I should have scored. It\u2019s disappointing, but I feel proud as well.\n\n\u201cThe confidence levels are quite high because of last week and I felt if I came on, I would make an impact. I feel like I did, but at the end of the day I feel like I should have scored as well. It\u2019s disappointing.\u201d\n\nManager Mick McCarthy desperately wanted to leave Georgia with three more points in the bank ahead of Tuesday night\u2019s trip to Switzerland, but was in no mood to be too down-hearted after seeing his side fight a rearguard action for long periods to protect keeper Darren Randolph, who barely had a save to make despite the home side\u2019s dominance of possession.\n\nAsked if it was a point gained or two dropped, McCarthy said: \u201cI see it absolutely as a point won. They are a very good side, but we did hit the post and Duffer (Shane Duffy) could have scored the winner from the corner at the end.\n\nRepublic of Ireland striker Aaron Connolly had two late chances in Georgia (Steven Paston/PA)\n\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea Ireland are 3 points clear at the top of Group D.\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddf0 Denmark host \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udded Switzerland later...\n\n\n\nWho'll finish 1st & 2nd? \ud83e\udd14#EURO2020 pic.twitter.com/Eg6DQx4VCb \u2014 UEFA EURO 2020 (@UEFAEURO) October 12, 2019\n\n\u201cAaron Connolly\u2019s had a chance running through and Darren hasn\u2019t made a save, so for all the possession and moving us around, he\u2019s not made one save.\n\n\u201cWe could have been better offensively, but defensively we were very good. If you had offered me four points in the games against Georgia at the start of the group, I\u2019d have taken it.\u201d\n\nIt was John Egan who glanced a fourth-minute header against the upright from a Conor Hourihane free-kick, but Ireland chances were few and far between until Connolly was thrown into the mix.\n\nAsked if he might have made the move earlier in the game, McCarthy said: \u201cI make the substitutions as I see fit, I don\u2019t look back with regret and think I should have done them sooner.\u201d\n\nGeorgia boss Vladimir Weiss was once again left to reflect upon what might have been with the nation\u2019s record against Ireland now standing at two draws and nine defeats.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis was a match of football without many chances. We tried to win, but we didn\u2019t have enough quality in the box. We tried shots and tried to score from set-pieces.\n\n\u201cI am happy for the guys. I said yesterday we needed to be at 120 per cent to win. Today it was maybe 110 per cent.\n\n\u201cIreland are maybe also happy (with a draw) as by the end of the game, they played five at the back. Maybe getting one point from Georgia is not bad.\u201d", "description": "The teenager came off the bench to breathe new life into Ireland\u00b4s quest.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/17/wire-19631334-1570898924-542_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
