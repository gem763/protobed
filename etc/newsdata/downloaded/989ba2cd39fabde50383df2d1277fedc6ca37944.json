Thank you for contacting us, your comments help us improve every day!\"\n\nThe move was praised by a number of people, including Ben and Melly, for being inclusive.\n\nAnother person on social media that supported the decision, said: \"I understand that you guys love girl positivity but please understand that there are trans men that get periods.\"\n\nHowever many women were unhappy about the decision and argued that it was \"eliminating women's biology\".\n\nFeminist campaigner Julie Bindel told The Mail on Sunday: \"Removing the female symbol from sanitary towel packaging is basically denying the existence of women.\n\n\"We\u2019re now moving towards the total elimination of women\u2019s biology. The women\u2019s symbol has been used by feminists for decades. This is pure cowardice and virtue signalling from these big corporate brands who are capitulating to the trans agenda.\"\n\nSimilarly over on Twitter more people shared their frustration.\n\nA woman named Caroline vowed to boycott Always.\n\nShe said: \"So that\u2019s Always boycotted in my family where there are five females. Men cannot have periods. Stop erasing women.\"\n\nA user named Vicki also commented: \"Women are quite literally being erased from sanitary products now. Is there anywhere we are allowed to be visible!? @Always I have bought your product since the age of 10. Stop erasing the people who use your product from your product. Or you erase my purchase power too.\"\n\nA third, named Anne, added: \"When will any company stand up for women? A company providing personal sanitary products for females keels over after 'Ben' complains.\"\n\nFollowing the announcement, a spokesperson for Proctor & Gamble said: \"For over 35 years Always has championed girls and women, and we will continue to do so.\n\n\"We\u2019re also committed to diversity and inclusion, and after hearing from many people across genders and age groups, we realised that not everyone who has a period and needs to use a pad identifies as female.\n\n\"To ensure that anyone who needs to use a period product feels comfortable in doing so with Always, we updated our pad wrapper design. Our mission remains to ensure no girl loses confidence at puberty because of her gender or period and we do this through our puberty education programs, by providing access to period products with programs such as #EndPeriodPoverty, and by using our brand voice to tackle societal barriers and stigmas like we did with #LikeAGirl.\"", "description": "A sanitary towel brand has announced they will be removing feminine logos from their products from December", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Universal Images Group Via Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20660628.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Always-Ultra-Sanitary-towels-on-a-white-background.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
