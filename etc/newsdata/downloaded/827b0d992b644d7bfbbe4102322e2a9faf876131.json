The majority of its transactions are associated with providing foreign exchange services to its clients, the most significant of which is the Australian government, to which it will pay A$1.7 billion.\n\nAustralia's official reserve assets, which include foreign currency assets, gold and international reserve asset created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), totaled A$77.5 billion as at June 30.\n\nThe RBA reported that staff costs rose 1.9% over the year, largely reflecting salary increases. While that is broadly in-line with industry pay rewards, it is well below the \"3 point something\" of wage growth that Governor Philip Lowe has repeatedly said he would like to see for a pick up in household consumption and inflation.\n\nLowe's total remuneration during the year was A$1.06 million.", "description": "Australia's central bank posts 18% rise in 2018/19 profit on currency fall", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9G0CU_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
