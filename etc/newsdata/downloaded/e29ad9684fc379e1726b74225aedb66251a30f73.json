Saudi Arabia might do worse than pinch that line as, for the first time, it rolls out the red carpet for foreign tourists as it seeks to develop a source of revenue other than that from oil, which so far has been its sole cash cow and is vulnerable to the slings and arrows of outrageous misfortune, such as the recent terrorist attack on a major production site. However, the nation\u2019s strict social mores \u2013 which, among other things, prohibit alcohol and require women to wear the hijab in public \u2013 could prove to be a drawback in its efforts to lure seekers of sun, fun, and frolic, which conventionally constitute the less-than-holy grail of mass tourism.\n\nAs a major concession to liberalism, the authorities will now permit men and women visitors to share hotel rooms without providing documentary evidence that they are married to each other.

It remains to be seen if such ploys will get the Saudis their just deserts or be dismissed as being no great sheikhs.", "description": "In the bad old days when advertisements for tobacco products were still allowed, a slogan for an American cigarette said \u2018I\u2019d walk a mile for a Camel\u2019.
