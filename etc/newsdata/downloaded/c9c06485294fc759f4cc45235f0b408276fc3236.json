But it said it sees a risk that the government\u2019s oil output forecast of 1.9 million barrels per day will not be met next year.\n\nCurrent oil output, the vast majority of which is produced by state-owned Pemex, averages about 1.7 million barrels per day.", "description": "S&P Global Ratings said on Friday that the Mexican government's 2020 economic growth forecast of 1.5% to 2.5% likely is too optimistic.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
