You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThere are recognisable parts of the old version of the site: it\u2019s similar colourful design, and that all-important search box.\n\nBut much else is very different. For one, the site was at that time referred to as \u201cGoogle!\u201d, with the shouting exclamation mark that introduced it to the world.\n\nIf you would prefer to actually use the old version of Google yourself, it is saved inside of the internet archive. Clicking this link will take you to that cached version \u2013 and you can even fast forward to how it looked later on, too.\n\nOver time, the search page actually becomes more simple, dropping the \u201cspecial searches\u201d and newsletter sign up in favour of the very simple page that appears to users today. But, of course, that appearance only hides the vast complexity that underpins today\u2019s Google, including the autocomplete option that cleverly guesses what you might be searching, and the live search results that show you information even before you stop typing.\n\nGoogle\u2019s official story began in 1995, at Stanford University, where founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin first met. Page, then considering Stanford for graduate study, was being shown around by student Sergey Bring \u2013 and there the pairing began.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

the pair were said to have fallen out about just about everything. Eventually, however, they came to realise they could work together, and they did: to create a website called Backrub.\n\nThat website soon had its name changed, to Google. That name was chosen because of the number 1 followed by 100 zeroes, an attempt to reflect the fact the pair were trying to organise the vast amount of information in the world.\n\nFrom there, Google continued to grow. It received its first investment, for $100,000, in August 1998 \u2013 marking one of its many birthdays. The technology grew, too, from the first server made of lego to the vast farms that power the company today.\n\nSo, too, grew the website itself, from the clunky vision of the early web that it appeared as in 1998 to today\u2019s deceivingly simple homepage.", "description": "It is Google\u2019s 21st birthday, and it is looking very grown up.
