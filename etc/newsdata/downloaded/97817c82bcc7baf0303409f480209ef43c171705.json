He'd rather show you.", "language": "en", "text": "Up close, you notice more subtle things about Jones. The lack of personal vanity that shows itself in a rumpled shirt. A perfectly imperturbable, unblinking gaze. A levelheadedness so pronounced that receiver Sterling Shepard says that \u201cnot once\u201d has the rookie quarterback done anything silly or immature.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s hard to see by his demeanor if he\u2019s not confident about anything,\u201d Coach Pat Shurmur says.\n\nAD\n\nThese all happen to be vital qualities for any athlete who wants to try to play under New York\u2019s klieg lights, much less succeed a legend in Eli Manning.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not an excuse-maker. He\u2019s stoic in his outlook, and he just keeps coming at you,\u201d said Jay Bilas, a longtime friend who coached Jones in youth basketball back in Charlotte, N.C. Yes, that Jay Bilas, who has known him since kindergarten.\n\nJones has been an NFL starter for only a week, but that\u2019s long enough for one of the great told-you-so\u2019s in NFL annals. The hoots when the Giants drafted Jones sixth overall still hum in the inner ears. Let\u2019s review, just for fun. \u201cBlue Clueless\u201d the New York Post headline blared. \u201cYou have got to be kidding me,\u201d Stephen A. Smith tweeted. \u201cThe Giants are completely lost,\u201d Mike Francesa brayed. Then there were Jones\u2019s competitors. The passed-over Dwayne Haskins said, \u201cThe NFL done messed up.\u201d The Cleveland Browns\u2019 Baker Mayfield told GQ Magazine he \u201ccannot believe\u201d the Giants drafted Jones, because he wasn\u2019t a \u201cwinner.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnalysis: The Browns could be in trouble\n\nJust try getting a rise out of Jones with any of it, try getting him to respond with a brag, after leading the Giants to that epochal victory over Tampa Bay last week in his first start, the second-largest comeback (18 points) by a rookie quarterback in NFL history. Try shaking him out of his habitual, implacable steady state. Can\u2019t do it.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to keep it going, stack a few wins together,\u201d he said equably after practice Wednesday.\n\nIt was, as Shurmur points out, just \u201ca one-game sample size.\u201d But there was something in the quality of that victory that suggests the Giants may have found their next great quarterback. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the smartest players I ever been around,\u201d Shepard says. Asked if he has seen any change in Jones\u2019s demeanor over the past week since he went from jeered joke to Wonder Boy in the space of a Sunday, Shepherd replied, \u201cYou see the same thing, which is great, and what you want to see: the same guy every day, that\u2019s going to come to work and handle business. And that\u2019s what he does.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrying to draft an answer at quarterback, a long-term face of the franchise, is the most precarious, job-threatening, trap-door task in the NFL. It\u2019s a metric-defying mystery why some slight-chested guy turns out to be great, while the head-turner built like a fountain statue fizzles. It\u2019s therefore worth exploring just what the Giants saw in Jones, while others shrugged and pegged him a low-rounder.\n\nAD\n\nStart with the discerning eye of Shurmur, who has been on eight playoff staffs, so he knows quality. And that of General Manager Dave Gettleman, a deeply experienced pro scout who started with the Buffalo Bills in 1986, and was sitting at the elbow of the legendary Ernie Accorsi on the day that Accorsi controversially traded for Eli Manning 15 years ago. If there was one thing both men understood about drafting a quarterback, it was that you don\u2019t risk a high pick on a player who had one wondrous season. Those are the most likely to disappoint.\n\nWhat gave them the certainty to seize Jones at No. 6 was three seasons of evidence, reams of film from 36 straight starts at Duke in a pro-style offense under renowned coach David Cutcliffe, during which Jones consistently showed some unmistakable traits: leggy 6-foot-5 athleticism, pro-caliber reads, and the ability to complete throws accurately under pressure.\n\nAD\n\nThe NFL\u2019s search for the next Sean McVay has created a new role: Head Coach of the Defense\n\nThere was a something else too: an underlying tenacity. Bilas saw it when Jones was the AAu basketball teammate of Grant Williams, the future No.1 NBA draft pick of the Celtics.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGrant was the most talented player, but Daniel was the best all-around player we had, and the toughest,\u201d Bilas says.\n\nJones attended Bilas\u2019s annual camps every summer, and in his junior year, he showed up with a cast on his broken right wrist. Bilas thought Jones had just come to watch, but Jones said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m playing,\u201d and took the court.\n\n\u201cLeft-handed, he was the best player in camp,\u201d Bilas said.\n\nHe was an unassuming, coachable kid, \u201cquiet, not demonstrative.\u201d Bilas had to threaten to bench him to get him to be more aggressive with the ball and drive one-on-one to the basket. Bilas told him, \u201cIf you don\u2019t get a charge called on you, you\u2019re coming out. I want you to knock a guy down. Go run somebody\u2019s ass over, and don\u2019t help them up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJones just nodded at him with spaniel eyes, and then went out and drove straight inside on two consecutive plays, \u201cguys bouncing off him.\u201d He made the shots and drew fouls.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t just come ready to play; he comes ready to fight,\u201d Bilas said. \u201cIf you put him in a room with a bunch of competitors and only one guy can come out? I\u2019d bet on him.\u201d\n\nThe film at Duke showed the same thing. Washington Redskins Coach Jay Gruden this week articulated what everyone now recognizes: Jones\u2019s middling collegiate career at Duke was actually a triumph of competitiveness over awfulness. His receivers dropped nine percent of his passes, the second-highest rate of any quarterback in his class. He\u2019d hit a guy right in the hands, and the ball would fall to the turf. He was constantly in danger of being overwhelmed, with an offensive line that ranked among the worst in major college football, 83rd in pressures allowed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe took a lot of shots; they were outmatched a lot of times,\u201d Gruden said. But Jones stood in, \u201cand did some really good things, showed his accuracy, toughness and athletic ability.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKevin B. Blackistone: Antonio Brown is guilty of self-immolation, but there was some truth in his NFL tirade\n\nFormer lineman turned NFL Network analyst Brian Baldinger perhaps summed up Jones\u2019s Duke career most succinctly: Of all the college quarterback prospects, Jones \u201chad to endure the most Saturdays full of wrong routes, poor protections, and the drops.\u201d\n\nHe still he threw for 8,201 yards and 52 touchdowns to just 29 interceptions and rushed for 17 more TDs. After he had run for his life against an undefeated Clemson, Cutcliffe marveled, \u201cI mean, how can you fight and battle and put the ball where he put it time and time again against that kind of pressure?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t have been so shocking then, when Jones completed 73 percent of his throws under pressure against Tampa Bay last week. Yet so many evaluators apparently hadn\u2019t paid proper attention, drawn more to louder talents or more vibrant eye candy. As Shurmur said with such a smack of satisfaction, \u201cI\u2019m fond of the phrase \u2018still waters run deep.\u2019 So that\u2019s what I think of Dan.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLike all rookie quarterbacks, naturally, Jones will have his reversals and bad days. One might even come this week against the win-starved Redskins. But it seems increasingly apparent that the much-mocked Giants properly valued this interesting self-contained young player, who radiates such stillness and yet promise. In fact, Jones may have shown everybody who he really is way back on Aug. 20, before he ever took the field. That was the day Mayfield\u2019s comments went public. Jones was asked how he\u2019d respond if they met face to face on a field.\n\nJones just said calmly, \u201cI\u2019d make sure we won the game.\u201d\n\nRead more NFL coverage from Post Sports:\n\nNFL owners shift focus from 18-game season to 17 games, expanded playoffs\n\nBaker Mayfield vs. Rex Ryan might be the NFL season\u2019s most fun, unexpected battle\n\nJalen Ramsey saga takes another turn as he leaves Jaguars for birth of child\n\nAD", "description": "On the NFL's biggest stage, Giants rookie quarterback stays focused on hitting his marks.", "authors": ["Sally Jenkins", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AmhidRwp46SAGVsYmYOoMfq1YwQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PER5MXHAV4I6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
