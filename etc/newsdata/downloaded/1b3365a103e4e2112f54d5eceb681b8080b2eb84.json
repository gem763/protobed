Or are there additional sexes?\n\nIn this same case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit decided that an individual's sex is whatever the individual says it is.\n\nA person's sex, in that court's vision, is neither static nor binary.\n\n\"By the same token, discrimination 'because of sex' inherently includes discrimination against employees because of a change in their sex,\" Judge Karen Nelson Moore, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, wrote in the opinion handed down by that court.\n\nShe elaborated in a footnote, comparing discrimination against \"transgender, intersex, or sexually indeterminate\" people to religious discrimination -- because, in her view, people can decide to change their sex, just as they can decide to change their religion.\n\n\"Moreover, discrimination because of a person's transgender, intersex, or sexually indeterminate status is no less actionable than discrimination because of a person's identification with two religions, an unorthodox religion, or no religion at all,\" wrote this judge. \"And 'religious identity' can be just as fluid, variable, and difficult to define as 'gender identity'; after all, both have 'a deeply personal, internal genesis that lacks a fixed external referent.'\"\n\nIs there truly no \"fixed external referent\" that would indicate to a medical doctor -- or even just a modestly intelligent person -- that a particular individual happens to be male or female?\n\nIn the Supreme Court on Tuesday, Justice Samuel Alito accurately noted that this case about the meaning of \"sex\" will open the door to other cases.\n\n\"Let me move beyond the bathroom to another example,\" Alito said. \"And it is not before us, but it will be coming. So a transgender woman is not permitted to compete on a woman's college sports team. Is that discrimination on the basis of sex in violation of Title IX?\"\n\nTitle IX prohibits discrimination \"on the basis of sex\" in education programs that receive federal funding.\n\nIf five Supreme Court justices decide in the funeral home case that a person's sex under Title VII is whatever the person says it is, the same logic applied to Title IX would mean that a high school boy could simply declare himself a female and then play on the girl's basketball team.\n\nBut the ultimate issue here is not bathrooms or basketball courts. It is truth.\n\nA person's sex is an objective and unchangeable fact. To claim otherwise is simply a lie.\n\nTerence P.
