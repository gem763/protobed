In the past year and a half, Dick\u2019s has overhauled its gun sales policies, most recently pulling all guns out of more than 100 stores. And even while the National Rifle Association, Republican lawmakers and critical customers have blasted Stack, he says that the company\u2019s entire firearms category is under \u201cstrategic review.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe said, \u2018The system is broken, we need to stand up and say something,\u2019 \u201d Stack told CNBC Tuesday morning. \u201cIf you have an expertise on this, and you feel that it\u2019s important to say, you should stand up and say it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTuesday marks the release of Stack\u2019s memoir, in which he tracks the company\u2019s evolution from a modest regional chain to one of the biggest players in the $70 billion sporting goods market. Stack often turns to gun reform as a particularly urgent issue facing his company, corporate America and the nation. Last month, Stack joined 145 CEOs who pressed Senate leaders to expand background checks to all firearms sales and enact stronger \u201cred flag\u201d laws. Signatories to a letter included the heads of major retailers, tech firms and financial institutions, from Levi Strauss to Twitter to Bain Capital.\n\nImmediately after the Parkland shooting, Stack raised the possibility of getting Dick\u2019s out of the gun business altogether, The Post reported earlier this year. In his memoir, Stack describes days of internal debates about the financial risk of such a drastic move. Even if the margin rate on guns wasn\u2019t terribly strong at Dick\u2019s, the company knew that hunters didn\u2019t only buy guns, but also hunting coats, boots, socks and other big-ticket items. Plus, hunting had been a mainstay of its business since the company\u2019s earliest days.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf we stopped selling guns altogether, we\u2019d be punishing those customers, some of whom had been with us for sixty years \u2014 men and women who knew to treat firearms with respect and who used them for legitimate sport,\u201d Stack wrote. \u201cDid it make sense to needlessly alienate loyal Dick\u2019s customers who bought shotguns and deer rifles, and were law-abiding and do-right citizens?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nUltimately, Dick\u2019s pulled all assault-style weapons from its stores, banned high-capacity magazines and \u201cbump stocks\u201d that could effectively convert semiautomatic weapons into machine guns. Stack also announced that Dick\u2019s would not sell firearms to people younger than 21.\n\nBut that strategy didn\u2019t cushion the company entirely. The policy changes after Parkland cost the company about a quarter of a billion dollars, Stack told CBS News. (The company has never disclosed what share of its sales come from gun sales alone.) For the fiscal year ending Feb. 2, 2019, same-store sales fell 3.1 percent, according to company earnings, with Stack blaming much of the slump on gun issues. Customers boycotted the company, and more than 60 employees quit.\n\nAD\n\nBut there\u2019s evidence of a turnaround. In August, Dick\u2019s announced that same store sales jumped 3.2 percent in the second quarter \u2014 its strongest showing since 2016 \u2014 and the company raised its full year guidance.\n\nAD\n\nSome of the company\u2019s critics charge that Stack and Dick\u2019s oppose Second Amendment rights, or that limiting sales of assault-style weapons means that all weapons will eventually be banned. The National Rifle Association on Monday tweeted a Breitbart story about Dick\u2019s destroying its unsold assault style rifles \u201cto keep them out of private hands.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Tex.) \u2014 who advocates for a ban on assault weapons and also a mandatory buyback \u2014 shot back. \u201cDick\u2019s Sporting Goods is doing more to keep Americans safe from assault weapons than Congress,\u201d O\u2019Rourke tweeted.\n\nAD\n\nDick's Sporting Goods is doing more to keep Americans safe from assault weapons than Congress. https://t.co/vDxjPMCxt2 \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) October 7, 2019\n\nAmerica\u2019s largest retailers have drawn particular scrutiny for their gun policies. After 24 people were killed in shootings at Walmart stores this summer, the company announced it would stop selling ammunition for military-style weapons and no longer allow customers to openly carry firearms in stores. Other retailers also changed their open-carry policies, including Kroger, CVS and Walgreens.\n\nAD\n\nLawmakers may be stalled on major gun legislation, but there is broad public support for change. A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found Americans across party and demographic lines overwhelmingly support expanded background checks for gun buyers and allowing law enforcement to temporarily seize weapons from troubled individuals. The poll found 86 percent of Americans support implementing \u201cred flag\u201d provisions that allow guns to be taken from people judged to be a danger to themselves or others. In addition, 89 percent support expanding federal background checks to cover private sales and gun-show transactions.\n\nAD", "description": "Tuesday marks the release of Ed Stack\u2019s memoir, in which he tracks the company\u2019s evolution from a modest regional chain to one of the biggest players in the sporting goods market.", "authors": ["Rachel Siegel", "National Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RDxJ3Z09l-mRh4RkRUgAiTOABG8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QU6VHRQ4T4I6RGHVZ3WPVB2BWY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
