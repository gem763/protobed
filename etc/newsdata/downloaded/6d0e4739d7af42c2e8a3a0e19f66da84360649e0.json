When the bill to block a no-deal Brexit becomes law today, he will be required to ask for an extension if a deal hasn\u2019t been agreed by 19 October. The opposition parties won\u2019t let him have an election. So what can he do?\n\nOne suggestion is that he should simply ignore the law and refuse to sign the letter to Donald Tusk, the EU president, daring his opponents to do their worst. Commentators have conjured up visions of Boris Johnson being escorted out of Downing Street by the Metropolitan Police; of court injunctions being sought; or of parliament reviving the ancient law of impeachment.\n\nNone of those is very likely. If parliament failed to approve a withdrawal agreement, and Johnson refused to send the letter, Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, would have to intervene, possibly by withdrawing civil service support for ministers.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut, more importantly, parliament will be sitting on 19 October, and the Commons would presumably pass a motion of no confidence in the government if the prime minister were trying to defy the law. Many loyal Conservatives would not support him.\n\nIt could be complicated for the Commons to then pass a motion of confidence in a government led by someone else. Disaffected Conservatives, independents and Liberal Democrats would want a temporary prime minister such as Kenneth Clarke, while Jeremy Corbyn would no doubt insist that if anyone should be prime minister it should be him, as leader of the second largest party.\n\nWe would then be in the same scenario as if Johnson resigned \u2013 which is what defying the law would be, in effect. Eventually, the House of Commons would have to accept someone as a prime minister to replace Johnson, even if it is impossible to predict how such an unprecedented situation might play out.\n\nBut the one thing it is possible to predict is that a prime minister would be unable simply to carry on regardless if they ignored a law passed by parliament.\n\nThe same goes for the idea that Johnson could advise the Queen today not to give the royal assent to the Hilary Benn bill, now that it has been passed by both houses of parliament. That process is as close to automatic as such things can be. As the saying goes, the monarch is \u201cjust a pen\u201d in British legislation.\n\nFor Johnson to try to interfere with it would be unconstitutional \u2013 that really would be \u201cdragging the Queen into politics\u201d \u2013 and he would probably simply be ignored.\n\nIf Johnson is to find a way out of his bind, it has to be by politics, not by defying the law or the constitution.", "description": "The prime minister is in a difficult position.
