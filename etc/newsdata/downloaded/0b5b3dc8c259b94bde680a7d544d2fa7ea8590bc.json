On Wednesday they had an opportunity on the Fed interest-rate cut but could only manage pressure for 30 minutes or so before the buyers jumped back in.\n\nWhat the bears need is a \"sell the news\" reaction that causes some worries that the market is running out of positive catalysts.\n\nWhile the bears complained again about the futility of Fed rate cuts the market is not showing any concern. The market has always been happy to celebrate a dovish Fed and even when it is well anticipated it still brings in buyers.\n\nThe action Thursday morning is slow but the longer the indices stay in positive territory the more likely buyers are going to inch back in and put capital to work. It is a combination of \"fear of missing out\" and \"climbing a wall of worry\" with a little \"short squeeze\" added the longer it lasts.\n\nI'm hopeful that with the Fed behind us and some of the other macro matters temporarily on hold that we will see more interest in stock-picking. I'm not seeing much yet but will be making some minor buys as the day continues.\n\nThe big buyback news from Microsoft (MSFT) is hitting at a very good time as it illustrates that there is still plenty of capital out there to push stocks higher even while bears are fretting about EPS growth.\n\nThis market could use more buying energy but conditions are good for it to drift higher from here.", "description": "The longer the indices stay in positive territory the more likely buyers are going to inch back in and put capital to work....MSFT", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "This Combination Makes The Market Ripe To Go Higher Here", "The Longer The Indices Stay In Positive Territory The More Likely Buyers Are Going To Inch Back In", "Put Capital To Work.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Bob Ciura", "Bruce Kamich", "Jim Cramer", "Jim Collins"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/5fb3a5d2-cdee-11e9-848d-6316b8a19abd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
