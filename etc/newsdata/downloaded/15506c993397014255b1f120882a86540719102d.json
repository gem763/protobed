I got my boyfriend Jamie on board and we were up for the challenge.\n\n\"We started by briefly working out how much it would cost us for a completely new kitchen and were shown prices of up to \u00a38,000.\"\n\nShocked, Jessie said it motivated them both to make their kitchen \"look brand new for a fraction of the price\".\n\n\"We decided on a \u00a3400 budget at the most, but the less we spent the better as we are looking to update the rest of the house too.\"\n\nTo begin with, Jessie and her partner started by looking up the prices of new cupboard doors - often the most expensive, second to appliances.\n\n\"These came in at around \u00a330 each and we were going to need 21. This already exceeded the budget so we started looking for different paints and ideas on how to give the kitchen a new lease of life in a different way.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n\"In terms of design, the rest of the kitchen then followed, for example the tiles to match the cupboards, colour grout pen and accessories etc.\n\n\"A lot of it we just learnt along the way, trial and error. Sugar soap was recommended to wash and wipe our cupboard doors before painting. I found this out on the DIY On a Budget page.\n\n\"We found the best way to get the paint on thick and smooth was to use the sponge roller. The tile grout needed a lot of patience and a steady hand, so we used the straight edge of a box lid to help with the lines.\"\n\nJessie said they'd always check reviews to make sure they were getting the best value for their money - and made sure to keep an eye on any home renovation programmes for extra tips and tricks.\n\n\"The paint we actually decided on was from Wilko\u2019s and was the cheapest and best reviewed one that we could find,\" she said.\n\n\"The trickiest part was the grouting for me. We used a dark grey grout pen from Amazon for around \u00a310. It gets easier as you get into it but takes a lot of patience to begin with as it has to be straight lines to follow the tiles.\n\n\"Jamie had more patience than me when it came to the grouting, he took over in the end whilst I did the finished touches on the cupboards and tiles.\n\n\"The accessories and spotlights were just personal things that we both liked from browsing online or watching home renovation shows.\n\nJessie got her wine rack, spice rack and under cupboard spotlights from Amazon.\n\n\"The most expensive part of the renovation was probably the clock which cost \u00a330. We picked this up whilst browsing in The Range for artificial flowers for the window sill.\n\n\"The paint was the second most expensive, we only had to use two and half litres costing \u00a325 which was such good value!\"\n\nJessie said her go-to stores were Wilko\u2019s for most of the tools and paint, Ikea for plants and kitchen utensils, Argos for the appliances to match and Amazon for things like, spotlights and cupboard handles.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n\"It took about a week's worth of evenings after finishing work at 5:30, and then our weekends on either side altogether - but we're so pleased with the end result.\n\n\"Some nights were up until 11pm fuelled by cups of tea! Forgetting that we hadn't had dinner yet, but it was so worth it.\"\n\nThe couple say they now plan to stay in their redecorated home and start a family - together with their three cats, Jj, Rupi and Luna.\n\n\"We plan to stay in our home for as long as possible. Maybe until we start a family and we out grow it. Or until something else catches our eye.\n\n\"We are hoping to make a start on the upstairs bathroom next as the kitchen has motivated us to achieve more! There will be more renovation rooms to follow I'm sure. This will probably be on a similar budget too.\n\n\"A brand new kitchen will probably take time to save up some money but this will be more than okay for now. We are so pleased with the results and the fact we worked so hard together to achieve it, makes us love it even more!\"", "description": "Exclusive: Jessie-lee Jarvis, 24 and her partner Jamie, 25 said they were left feeling inspired after joining a Facebook page on how to renovate for less", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Mirrorpix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20539188.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Excl-Couple-knock-\u00a38000-off-their-kitchen-renovation-by-doing-it-themselves-and-it-looks-amazin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
