All 189 people on board died.\n\nThe official crash report, released by Indonesia last week, gives a definitive timeline of what happened on the doomed flight.\n\nIt shows that the pilots tried more than 20 times to stop the plane's computer forcing its nose down. But they could not bring it under control, and the plane crashed into the sea at 450mph.\n\nThis is the full timeline of the fatal flight, according to investigators.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nLion Air flight JT 610 took off from Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport at 6.20 a.m. on October 29, 2018. Less than 13 minutes later it smashed into the sea, killing everyone on board.\n\nIt was the first of two fatal crashes for Boeing's 737 Max. A second crashed over Ethiopia in March 2019, leading to the grounding of the plane, and plunging Boeing into an ongoing crisis.\n\nThe final report, released by investigators last week, pointed to flaws in Boeing's design of the plane, as well as mistakes by the airline and its staff.\n\nThe timeline it outlines shows the crew wrestling to control the plane as automatic anti-stall software, known as MCAS, overrode their instructions and pushed the nose down more than 20 times. It crashed into the Java Sea at around 450mph.\n\nHere is what happened on board:\n\n6.18 a.m.: JT 610 was given clearance to take off from Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.

Two displays in the cockpit recorded different wind speeds, while the plane's two angle of attack sensors, which measure its orientation in the air, disagreed by a substantial 21 degrees.\n\nREUTERS/Beawiharta/File Phot\n\n\n\n\n\n6.20 a.m., 32 seconds: The plane experienced a \"control column stick shaker\" warning, which physically shakes the plane's controls to alert the pilots of a potential stall. It continued for most of the flight.\n\nThis video shows the controls column stick shaker on flight simulator for the Boeing 737-800, a predecessor to the 737 Max.\n\nYoutube Embed:\n\n//www.youtube.com/embed/NtQqb7rstrQ\n\nWidth: 560px\n\nHeight: 315px\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.20 a.m., 37 seconds: The plane sounded a \"takeoff configuration warning\" \u2014 a generic alert which flags potential problems.
