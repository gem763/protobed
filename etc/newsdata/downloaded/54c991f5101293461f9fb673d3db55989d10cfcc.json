Instead, this is a camera that prioritizes a simple, compact form factor to help you look much more skillful with a camera than you actually are.\n\nModern vlogs, with their tight editing and many establishing shots, take a lot of precision and patience to shoot, and that\u2019s where a camera like the Osmo Pocket comes in. Over the past decade, YouTube vlogging has developed its own style of cinematography, with beautifully framed time-lapses serving as frequent scene transitions between succinct monologues. Although this is designed to create an impression of effortlessness, its execution is anything but. DJI\u2019s new camera is packed with features that are designed to close this gap.\n\nAt its core, the Osmo Pocket has a three-axis stabilized gimbal that ensures your footage is smooth and appears professional even when you\u2019re operating without the help of a tripod. It\u2019s also got more advanced functionality like support for time-lapses and motion-lapses that make the other staples of the vlogging genre far easier to capture.\n\nDJI\u2019s $349 Osmo Pocket shoots in HD or 4K resolution, and once you\u2019ve captured your footage, you can offload it via a USB-C cable to your PC or export it directly to your phone via the DJI Mimo app. It\u2019s a very capable camera, but it falls short of being the all-in-one vlogging powerhouse that it aspires to be.\n\nOur review of DJI Osmo Pocket Verge Score 7.5 out of 10 Good Stuff 4K video capture at 60 fps\n\nEasy to start shooting\n\nMotion-lapse is intuitive to use\n\nClever controls for such a small device Bad Stuff Audio doesn\u2019t match video quality\n\nNot rugged at all\n\nOne-inch screen is really tiny Buy for $349.00 from DJI Buy for $349.99 from Best Buy\n\nThe centerpiece of the DJI Osmo Pocket is its three-axis stabilizer. It\u2019s a compact and proficient mechanism, and the Osmo Pocket is keen to remind you of this. Every time you turn the camera on, the gimbal rotates one way and then the other with a satisfying click, like it\u2019s doing a morning stretch after getting out of bed.\n\nAs a whole, the camera feels solidly built, but the gimbal mechanism seems delicate. You\u2019re not going to take the Osmo Pocket to many of the locations where you\u2019d use a GoPro Hero 7. DJI\u2019s camera isn\u2019t waterproof, and I worry about dropping it onto concrete, let alone using it to capture myself skiing down a mountain.\n\nDJI\u2019s handheld camera is much better suited for vlogging. Its long handle is designed to be held rather than strapped to the side of a helmet, and its gimbal won\u2019t even be able to move properly if you don\u2019t give the camera enough space.\n\nBeneath the camera, there are a pair of buttons \u2014 one multifunctional and one for recording video and taking photos \u2014 and a small one-inch touchscreen. The camera also comes with a small, removable pair of connectors (one USB-C and one Lightning), which you attach to the camera. These then allow the Osmo Pocket to be fixed to the bottom of a phone and held horizontally to allow you to control the camera using your phone\u2019s touchscreen or transfer your footage. When not in use, the connector can be flipped around so it doesn\u2019t protrude.\n\nThe Osmo Pocket can be easily attached to a smartphone, but that makes it much more bulky\n\nThe one-inch screen is tiny, so it\u2019s got a basic user interface that\u2019s designed around four menus that each swipe in from a different side. You can use these to change settings like the resolution you\u2019re using or putting the camera in selfie mode. As you\u2019d expect from a touchscreen of this size, attempting to use it directly is a bit of a pain. The menu options are small and hard to tap accurately, and swiping the bottom menu upward can be a challenge when you\u2019ve got the phone connector accessory inserted beneath it.\n\nThankfully, unless you\u2019re constantly switching between resolutions or frame rates, most of the functions you\u2019ll want to use can be accessed from the multifunction button, leaving the screen for simpler tweaks like setting the part of the frame where you want the image exposed or picking an object for the camera to automatically keep in focus.\n\nHolding the camera\u2019s multifunction button turns the Osmo Pocket on and off, pressing it once toggles between video and stills mode, two presses recenters the camera, and three will flip the camera into selfie mode. There will almost certainly be people who need more immediate access to the camera\u2019s advanced features, but for me, the quick-access selection adequately covered the things I needed immediate access to while using the camera.\n\nIf you want more immediate access to the camera\u2019s advanced functionality, attaching it to a smartphone is a great way to achieve that. The only problem is that this turns the Osmo Pocket from a device that can comfortably be used with one hand into something that feels like it needs two hands to operate properly. For me, this trade-off doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nWithout a phone attached, you can shoot within 10 seconds; using a phone adds a couple of seconds of setup. With the Android device I was using (a Pixel 3), the phone was clever enough to open the companion DJI Mimo app automatically every time I plugged the camera in. It was never as quick as opening the camera app on my phone, but it was fast enough that I rarely missed something that I was intending to capture.\n\nAlthough there are a fair amount of additional features like time-lapses, panoramas, and motion-lapses for those who want them, the Osmo Pocket is at its best when you\u2019re just walking, shooting, and letting the three-axis gimbal do its work.\n\nI was almost ready to believe that I was going to effortlessly create Kubrick-esque steady-cam shots before I started using the Osmo Pocket for myself, but the reality was a lot more modest. Yes, you can try to steady your shots so they glide through a space, but in my experience, you\u2019ll always be able to see the camera bob slightly with each step you take, no matter how careful you are. If you take less effort, then your footage starts to look like a scene from a first-person shooting game, and that\u2019s especially true if you try running with the camera.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to be prepared to adjust settings so your shot isn\u2019t overexposed or underexposed\n\nThe quality of the footage I captured with the Osmo Pocket was also good. Colors are vibrant (if a touch oversaturated). There\u2019s a little bit of noise when you\u2019re shooting in 4K, but the detail was generally good. Unfortunately, the camera\u2019s low-light performance wasn\u2019t quite as strong. I recorded a fair amount of footage on city streets late at night, and there was plenty of noise visible in the resulting shots.\n\nFor the most part, you can get away with pointing the camera at whatever you want to shoot and pressing the record button, but you\u2019ll still need to be prepared to manually adjust settings in order to make sure your shot isn\u2019t overexposed or underexposed. At one point, I tried to capture a building against a bright afternoon sky, and the detail of the building was almost entirely lost in shadow because I didn\u2019t tap the building to tell the Osmo Pocket to expose for it.\n\nAlong with supporting multiple resolutions, the Osmo Pocket can also be switched between 30 fps and 60 fps. I spent some time playing around with the different options before settling on 30 fps as the one that offered me the best mix of video quality and file sizes.\n\nThe aforementioned time-lapse feature is one of the real highlights of the Osmo Pocket. It can either do a static time-lapse or it can pan between two points. Setting up the latter is surprisingly simple to do; you place the Osmo Pocket on a stable surface and then physically rotate its gimbal to indicate the time-lapse\u2019s start and end points. The only problem here is that the Osmo Pocket isn\u2019t exactly designed to be stood up like this, and I was constantly worried that the wind was going to blow it over whenever I tried capturing a time-lapse outside. A wireless module gives the camera a wider, more stable base, and it also lets you wirelessly control the Osmo Pocket from your phone, but it\u2019s an optional accessory that costs around $100.\n\nThe Osmo Pocket is also capable of shooting in slow motion, where you\u2019ll be able to capture at 120 fps to create a 30 fps video. Unfortunately, when I tried the mode, the footage came out looking very noisy and grainy, and it was a definite step down from the camera\u2019s normal quality. In the end, this was the mode with which I spent the least amount of time, which is a shame since it could have been such a useful feature.\n\nThe Osmo Pocket is tailored to the vlogging genre, which makes its mediocre audio a letdown\n\nQualms about the quality of its slow-motion recording aside, overall, I liked the quality of the video footage that the DJI Osmo Pocket produced. However, audio was more of a letdown. Part of it is an ergonomic oversight. The Osmo Pocket has two microphones, one just above the recording button and another on the bottom of the device, and if you\u2019re not careful, you\u2019ll rub your hand all over both of them as you change grip positions. I got better at not holding the camera \u201cwrong\u201d with some practice, but ultimately, the Osmo Pocket\u2019s audio always sounded like it was recorded from a small built-in microphone \u2014 because it was.\n\nGrid View Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\n\nConsidering how geared the Osmo Pocket is toward the vlogging genre, it\u2019s fair to expect better sound quality from it than a typical tiny video camera. DJI sells a small USB-C to microphone jack converter for the camera, and there are also mics available that connect directly over USB-C. You\u2019ll want to verify that third-party accessories work before buying one for yourself. If you intend to do any serious vlogging with the Osmo Pocket, I\u2019d seriously think about picking up an external mic to use with the camera.\n\nYou can also use the DJI Osmo Pocket to take photographs. You can switch to this mode quickly by tapping the multifunction button once. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this mode, given that shooting photos is almost an afterthought with a camera of this kind. It\u2019s not that the photographs are especially good \u2014 I\u2019d say they\u2019re about on par with an average smartphone camera \u2014 but quickly taking them is very easy to do. Whenever I take a photo with a smartphone or standalone camera, I always have to pause momentarily before I take the first shot to avoid blur from the motion of me raising the camera. With the Osmo Pocket, this wasn\u2019t nearly as much of an issue. I could move the camera around, snap shots, and worry far less about making sure it was steady before pressing the shutter button. That\u2019s the magic of the gimbal at work.\n\nTaking photographs with the video-focussed camera is a surprising highlight\n\nIf you\u2019re a more considered photographer, then you\u2019ll likely do better with a proper camera. In particular, I often found it hard to frame subjects properly with the Osmo Pocket. Not only is the camera\u2019s screen really small, but the stabilization meant that it could be hard to tilt the camera to make sure the scene was level. I\u2019d try to tilt the camera, and it would work to cancel out the movement. It was often a frustrating experience.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDJI\u2019s Osmo Pocket does a great job of delivering on the capabilities of its form factor. It\u2019s compact, easy to use, and I liked the quality of the video footage it produced (even if its audio falls short of its aspirations as a vlogging camera). But it\u2019s a harder camera to recommend than other portable solutions for shooting video because of its price and lack of versatility. It\u2019s not as rugged as an action cam, and it\u2019s not as cheap as a standalone gimbal for your existing smartphone.\n\nThe DJI Osmo Pocket is a great example of a gadget that\u2019s designed to fit a particular form factor. It really is tiny for the job that it does, and if that\u2019s the overriding priority for you, then there\u2019s little else out there like it. But if you don\u2019t need the ergonomics and pocketability, then you might be better served by a more general purpose alternative.\n\nPhotography by Jon Porter / The Verge", "description": "DJI\u2019s Osmo Pocket handheld video camera isn\u2019t designed to give you the same raw video or audio quality that you would get when recording with a DSLR and an external mic.
