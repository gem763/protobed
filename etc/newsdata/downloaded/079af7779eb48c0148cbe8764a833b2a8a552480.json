Rookie Victor Olofsson matched an NHL record in becoming the fourth NHL player to score first six career goals on the power play in a game Buffalo converted two of five opportunities.\n\nJeff Skinner also scored and defenceman Rasmus Dahlin had two assists, while Carter Hutton stopped 23 shots and improved to 3-0.\n\nJoel Armia scored twice and added an assist in a game the Canadiens rallied from a two-goal, third-period deficit. Jesperi Kotkaniemi and Ben Chiarot, with the tying goal with 7:06 remaining, also scored for the Canadiens (1-0-2)\n\nKeith Kincaid stopped 34 shots, including getting his right pad out to stop Skinner redirecting Johansson's pass into the crease with 2:51 remaining.\n\nTurning point\n\nThe game was decided just as Montreal's Paul Byron exited the penalty box while serving a slashing penalty.\n\nEichel's shot from the slot was blocked by Chiarot and the puck dribbled to Sabres defenceman Colin Miller in the left circle. Miller immediately slid a pass to Johansson, who swept it into the open side from the right circle.\n\nEichel scored the most impressive goal of the game in putting Buffalo ahead 3-2 late in the second period.\n\nCircling with the puck inside his zone, Eichel eluded Tomas Tatar's check at his own blue line and then built up a head of steam driving through the neutral zone. With Chiarot and Jeff Petry backing up, Eichel fired a low hard shot that sneaked in under Kincaid.\n\nMontreal was coming off a 6-5 shootout win at Toronto on Saturday in which the Canadiens rallied from a 4-1 deficit. The Habs also overcame a 2-0 deficit in a season-opening 4-3 shootout loss at Carolina last week.\n\nSuper power\n\nThe Sabres entered the game tied for league lead in converting 60% of their power-play chances (6 of 10), before Olofsson capitalized on Buffalo's first opportunity with a one-timer off Eichel's pass into the right circle to open the scoring 5:04 into the first period.\n\nThe 24-year-old Swede's power-play goal streak dates to the two he scored in two games last season.\n\nWinnipeg's Craig Norwich in 1979-80, Hartford's Sylvain Turgeon in 1983-84 and Islanders' Jeff Norton, from 1987-88 to 1989-90, also scored their first six career on the power play.", "description": "Marcus Johansson scored 1:30 into overtime, leading the Buffalo Sabres to a 5-4 win over the Montreal Canadiens on Wednesday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5315761.1570672571!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/canadiens-sabres-hockey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
