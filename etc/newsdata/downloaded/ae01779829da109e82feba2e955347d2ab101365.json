As the country\u2019s southernmost prefecture, Okinawa is closer to Taiwan than it is to Japan\u2019s main island of Honshu, and boasts different traditions, landscapes, architecture and cuisine that makes it a fascinating place to visit.\n\nOur reporter Mai recently took a trip down to Okinawa, and one of the first things she did after arriving was seek out the local soul food, heading straight to a place that had come highly recommended: Pork Tamago Onigiri.\n\n\u25bc The name of the restaurant is written in Japanese beneath a larger sign that shouts \u201cOnigiri Breakfast\u201d.\n\nWith a name that literally translates to \u201cPork Egg Rice Ball\u201c, there was no mistaking Pork Tamago Onigiri\u2019s specialty, but when Mai arrived, she found there was a huge variety of rice balls to choose from on the menu. And while most rice balls in Japan are triangular in shape, the ones here looked more like seaweed-covered sandwiches than onigiri.\n\nPork Egg Onigiri is a local soul food that\u2019s popular in Okinawan homes but virtually unheard of in mainland Japan, so Mai wasn\u2019t going to miss out on getting one now that she was here. The only problem was deciding what type of pork to get, but the choice was made easy when she realised that the head store she was at, located in Okinawa\u2019s American Village in Chatan, had some exclusive items unavailable at their other three stores.\n\nSo she went for a limited-edition \u201cTacope\u00f1o\u201d for 450 yen and a \u201cTonkatsu Tamago\u201d, which was also 450 yen. And when they arrived, they were wrapped in paper, which made them look more like burgers than rice balls.\n\nUnwrapping them like gifts on Christmas Day, Mai was delighted to see that they really did look more like burgers, as they were much bigger than any rice balls she\u2019d ever seen.\n\nWith their contents spilling out enticingly, the \u201cTacope\u00f1o\u201d beckoned to Mai first, with its red-tinged contents hinting at the spice kick to come. Underneath the top layer of rice and seaweed was a slice of egg omelette, followed by pork in the form of Spam, a beloved ingredient in Okinawa that\u2019s used in a large number of local dishes, and underneath that was a huge fried tomato that looked to be twice as big as a regular tomato.\n\nIt was fresh and insanely delicious, and when Mai added the small tub of salsa sauce to it, it added a taco-style flavor to the Tacope\u00f1o, giving her two different taste sensations for the price of one.\n\nNext, it was time to try the enormous Tonkatsu Tamago (Tonkatsu Egg), which comes with not one but two tonkatsu (breaded, deep-fried pork cutlets), along with a slice of egg omelette, a slice of Spam, some cabbage, and a generous serving of mayonnaise.\n\nIt tasted so good and so bad for you at the same time, just like a true soul food should, and while it had all the familiar ingredients you would find in a regular tonkatsu dish, the extra addition of Spam, egg and seaweed gave it a bold, punchy flavour that made it truly unique.\n\nThe rice balls from Pork Tamago Onigiri certainly live up to their slogan of being a \u201cfreshly made, one-handed feast\u201d, and Mai highly recommends trying them when you\u2019re in the area. Not only are they a great introduction to Okinawa\u2019s homely, local cuisine but they\u2019re a rare treat you won\u2019t find on mainland Japan.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re looking to refresh your palate afterwards, you might want to try a Coke in a limited-edition Okinawan design bottle, or this quirky yet tasty rice beverage that\u2019s exclusive to the area.\n\nRestaurant Information\n\nPork Tamago Onigiri Honten Chatan American Village branch / \u30dd\u30fc\u30af\u305f\u307e\u3054\u304a\u306b\u304e\u308a\u672c\u5e97 \u5317\u8c37\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u30f3\u30d3\u30ec\u30c3\u30b8\u5e97\n\nAddress: Okinawa-ken, Nakagami-gun, Chatan Mihama 9-21\n\n\u6c96\u7e04\u770c\u4e2d\u982d\u90e1\u5317\u8c37\u753a\u5b57\u7f8e\u6d5c9-21\n\nHours: 7 a.m.-8 p.m. every day\n\nWebsite\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Hungry and on the go?
