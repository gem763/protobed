Maybe they should have done that earlier. If they'd believed that they could not service that debt, they should have done something about it before 2019.\"\n\nProfit warnings\n\nMr Fontenla-Novoa said that from about 2011, after he had left the business, Thomas Cook \"shrank capacity\" in real terms by reducing the number of available seats on aircraft or hotel rooms.\n\n\"You look at turnover in 2010, it was \u00a39bn. You look at turnover in 2019, [it was] \u00a39bn, which in effect, because of inflation, capacity has gone down,\" Mr Fontenla-Novoa said.\n\n\"In the same period of time, Jet2holidays have grown from nowhere to four million passengers a year. On the Beach have grown from nowhere to 1.6 million passengers a year. Love Holidays, similar amounts. I believe there was growth in the market. I believe we would have grown with that growth in the market. Instead, Thomas Cook... has shrunk, competitors have grown.\"\n\nMs Reeves cited Mr Fankhauser's comments that Thomas Cook could not have grown because it was spending \u00a3150m to \u00a3170m per year servicing debt.\n\nHowever, Mr Fontenla-Novoa said it \"was not about buying businesses or investing in technology, it's about the capacity that you put onto the marketplace.\"\n\nFormer chief executive Harriet Green said she had inherited in 2012 \"three profit warnings, a huge wall of debt, and a business model that was entirely out of sync with the industry.\"\n\n\"That's what I fought for 28 months, 22 hours a day, to change. And my responsibility is that I failed to complete that. This is a brand that was loved, with staff as loyal and as amazing as I've seen anywhere in the world,\" she added.\n\nBonus\n\nMs Green, who now works for IBM, said she had implemented a strategy that was more focused on technology, but was asked to leave her post by the chairman before she had fully implemented it.\n\nThomas Cook, whose founder was born during the Industrial Revolution, was Britain's oldest holiday company before going into liquidation in September. This put around 9,000 UK jobs at risk and left 150,000 holiday-makers overseas, who were repatriated at an estimated cost of \u00a3100m to the taxpayer.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Former Thomas Cook staff protested outside Parliament after the company went into liquidation\n\nMr Fankhauser last week told MPs on the committee that the company was dragged down by its debts, which reached over \u00a31.4bn in 2018. \"I'm sorry for not being able to turn around this company at pace and to really pay back this debt.\n\n\"Since 2012 we paid \u00a31.2bn of interest costs and refinancing costs. Imagine if we had only half of that reinvested in the business, we could have been faster,\" Mr Fankhauser said.\n\nFormer senior Thomas Cook executives told the BBC the company's debt problems began with the MyTravel merger. \"We were told we're carrying this debt from a deal that was done many years ago and now we've got this baggage around our necks,\" said one former executive, who asked not to be identified.\n\n\"What that means is we have to sell about 2,000 holidays to even pay a very small piece of that debt back. What we're doing is essentially working to pay back the interest,\" she said.\n\nThe year after the MyTravel deal, Mr Fontenla-Novoa was awarded a \u00a35m bonus. He said it was \"not for delivering the deal\" but \"for delivering the synergies\". He said \"those synergies were not just delivered, they were audited by external auditors\".", "description": "Manny Fontenla-Novoa and Harriet Green defend their roles at the tour firm as its debts mounted.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1457C/production/_109342338_thomascookexecs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
