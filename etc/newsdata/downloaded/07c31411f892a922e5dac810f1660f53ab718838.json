I'm sunny\n\nThese pictures are the stuff of dreams . . . and nightmares. I could only fantasise about being that pretty when I was a teenager. It makes me look angelic, which as a tomboy I was not. Even then I had high cheekbones, which have been softened to give me a heart-shaped face and the hint of dimples. The de-ageing has also made my nose look smaller. Sadly I can attest that the Platell hooter made its unwanted appearance long before my 15th birthday.\n\nAnd now for the nightmare of the \u2018Benjamin Button\u2019 treatment which \u2018aged\u2019 us all. First, I\u2019d never go grey. My mum had her hair dyed honey blonde until the day she died at 90 and I intend to follow in her footsteps. In this image my eyes have disappeared into hard, disappointed, little currants. As for the creases across my nose, that\u2019s a frowner\u2019s face, and that\u2019s not me.\n\nI\u2019m fairly content with the way I look now. With help from fillers and twice annual cosmetic procedures my face is not bad for my age. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have a facelift. A tendency to see the sunny side of life means I\u2019ll never look like that crumpled old bag in the picture.\n\nFrom left to right: Amanda Platell aged 15, de-aged to look 15, the real Amanda at 61 and aged to look 80\n\nSarah Vine: Stern? I look like Cruella De Vil!\n\nWell, that\u2019s a relief. This de-ageing lark is clearly rubbish, because the digital young me looks nothing like the real young me who, as you can see, was not nearly as \u2018Instagrammable\u2019 as the AI version. The 16- year-old me was not remotely polished. This person looks like something off the Disney Channel. Still, it gives me hope since it implies the aged version of me might also not be accurate. Which would be nice because she looks like a cross between Quentin Crisp and Cruella de Vil. The main worry is how stern I look. And the fact that I seem to have gone a bit orange. And the wrinkles. And the jowls. Oddly the grey hair doesn\u2019t bother me so much: I think you get to a point when dyeing your hair dark actually makes you look older. At 52, I don\u2019t feel too bad about my appearance but that has not always been the case. Stress, thyroid problems, illness and hair loss sapped my confidence in my 30s and 40s and it\u2019s taken over two years to get myself back in any kind of shape. Maybe I\u2019ll put a picture of the old bag on the fridge, a terrifying reminder of what awaits me if I don\u2019t stick to the programme.\n\nFrom left to right: Sarah Vine aged 16, de-aged to look 16, Sarah aged 52, and made to look 80\n\nAndrew Pierce: Book me in for plastic surgery!\n\nI was curious about the de-ageing technique in De Niro movie The Irishman. I\u2019m adopted, so have no way of knowing if my blood family aged well or not. But I can\u2019t stand the image of me as a teenager. I look like a girl \u2014 and much older than the 15 years I\u2019m supposed to be. There is also one glaring omission from my youthful visage. I was stricken by acne from 14 to 25. The doctor recommended cabbage water. The result? The acne stayed but my carbon emissions went through the roof. But in this image my skin is baby smooth.\n\nGazing into the future is even more depressing. I\u2019m more lined than an Ordnance Survey map. However, I draw comfort from the fact I still have hair. Six years ago mine was falling out. I invested in a treatment which involves a cocktail of vitamins and minerals being injected into the scalp, and with top-ups my barnet is still intact. Now and again I treat myself to a chemical peel, which smooths the surface of the face. But having peered into the future, perhaps I should consider more cosmetic treatments to prevent that age-old insult \u2018he\u2019s got a great face for radio\u2019.\n\nFrom left to right: Andrew Pierce aged 15, de-aged to look 15, Andrew at 58, and made to look 80\n\nHenry Deedes: Boyband star to ripped Tony Blair\n\nYowzers! That was my first reaction to the picture of my future self. No one likes the thought of getting old, do they? Particularly when you end up looking like a gym bunny Tony Blair as I seem destined to.\n\nBut I\u2019ve actually quite grown to like this image of my aged self. Offered the chance to look like that I\u2019d probably take it. Mainly because the hairline\u2019s held pretty steady, even if it is a bit Sven-Goran Eriksson.\n\nIt\u2019s odd looking at the real picture of me as teenager and seeing how unhealthy I Iook. Weird because I barely touched alcohol then so I would have thought my skin would have been much clearer but it looks bloody awful. I assume that\u2019s probably diet \u2014 I ate garbage then. So the de-aged pictured, with its baby-smooth skin, is too generous. That said, I don\u2019t like it. It makes me look like something out of a boyband.\n\nLooking to the future, my teeth are going slightly wonky with my advancing years, so I\u2019d consider getting them straightened again.\n\nOtherwise, I\u2019m happy to see what nature has in store \u2014 and if I look like my aged picture at 80, so be it.", "description": "Robert De Niro, 76, has been 'de-aged' in his new film The Irishman and manages to turn back the clock 50 years.
