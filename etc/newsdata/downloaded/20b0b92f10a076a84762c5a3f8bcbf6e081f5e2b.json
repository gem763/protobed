In itself, this does not damn successive Australian governments for doing hardly anything to cut emissions. In fact, Australia has led the world in installing renewable energy generation, particularly rooftop solar, that now accounts for about one-quarter of energy generated. Instead, the IMF\u2019s assessment of G20 nation climate change policies confirms that Australia faces one of the steepest bills for reducing emissions because of its economy\u2019s traditional reliance on fossil fuels, as highlighted by Santos\u2019s consolidation of northern Australian gas assets such as Darwin\u2019s LNG plant. The most cost-efficient and fair instrument for reducing global emissions - a global carbon price - would likely still leave Australia with fossil fuel industries such as LNG exports demanded by a power hungry world.\n\nThe failure of successive governments to come clean on the relatively high costs of Australia\u2019s climate change challenge lies behind the national debacle of climate change and energy policy over the past decade. Bill Shorten even insisting during this year\u2019s election campaign that it was stupid to ask about the costs of Labor\u2019s ambitious renewables and emissions reductions targets. Failure to recognise the challenge has pushed the political process into more costly policies - such as the concentration on the renewable energy target - that are now destabilising the national energy market itself and which have simply raised the political costs of further action. The Grattan Institute reckons that $400 billion of new energy generation and distribution assets will be required over the next 30 years to transform Australia\u2019s energy system. If the cost is not to be ruinous for the taxpayer, it will require huge amounts of private investment to transform one of the world\u2019s longest electricity grids into one that can accommodate the \u201canarchy\u201d of widely dispersed and unreliable renewables. That will require a well-functioning market to attract the necessary risk capital.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t start from here, as more than one speaker suggested at The Australian Financial Review National Energy Summit last week. The market has been so distorted by high-cost renewable energy subsidies, argues Energy Minister Angus Taylor, that the government has no alternative but to intervene with more subsidies, taxpayer-backed investments and price controls just to keep the lights on. In particular, the system needs more peak-demand gas generation to take over when the sun doesn\u2019t shine and the wind doesn\u2019t blow. Yet the nation\u2019s peak energy regulator, Energy Security Board chair Kerry Schott, warned at our Summit that this could in fact crowd out the needed private investment, just as zero marginal renewables threaten to kill off the economics of baseload coal power. Today we reproduce much of her compelling address to last week\u2019s Energy Summit in our features pages to inform readers about the complexity of the task. Ms Schott warns that the risks of an energy grid not designed to cope with such an influx of unreliable wind and solar power extend to a lack of control of its physical inertia and power flows that threaten to damage household appliances. The network will be transformed from a dumb grid to a sophisticated trading platform of energy services. But the inevitable costs of this transition will force the Australian debate to face up more clearly to the trade-offs. Even as we harness the opportunities of our rich solar and wind resources, Australia must seek to exploit the possibilities to capture, store and use carbon emitted by the new-generation of more efficient coal-fired power stations. Even as coal tapers off, gas will become more important. It is the feedstock for new fuels like hydrogen. Rather than restricting gas supplies, investing in gas will be central to a market solution for climate change in Australia and globally. Finally, as the industry superannuation funds have figured out, Australia should stop ruling out the modern version of nuclear power as a reliable baseload alternative to coal. A genuine climate emergency surely requires all hands on deck.", "description": "The scale of the IMF's global carbon tax shows a problem that needs all solutions -- including clean coal and nuclear", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4996%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_14/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a10428d1b13a0e571448a869f876a7745dc3431f", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
