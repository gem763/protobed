Pence, of course, agreed.\n\nPence\u2019s European trip has become a vehicle to transfer American tax dollars into Trump\u2019s pockets. But the direct impact of this minor grift pales beside the much larger consequence of suborning the vice-president\u2019s participation in Trump\u2019s corruption.\n\nAs an ethical violation, what\u2019s notable about Pence going (literally) out of his way to stay at a Trump property is the meagerness of the stakes and the black-and-white clarity of the offense. Any government official below Trump\u2019s rank who engaged in a similar offense would be fired. Just imagine if some assistant secretary was running a hotel on the side and told one of their subordinates to stay there on official business. They\u2019d be fired on the spot.\n\nIt might seem strange for Trump and Pence to incur the awful publicity that comes with engaging such corruption in broad daylight, especially when the payoff \u2014 a handful of additional customers at a resort \u2014 is relatively small. But it is precisely that disjuncture between the brazenness and the scale that makes this episode significant. Pence is establishing the principle that Trump is entitled to profit from his office, and \u2014 far more importantly \u2014 his participation signals his culpability in the scheme.\n\nTrump is generally an outgrowth of the party\u2019s broader authoritarian evolution, but one way in which he is an outlier is his determination to blend his business with his public duties. Before Trump, Republicans never contemplated the idea that a president could run a private business while serving in office. Trump has blurred this line so repeatedly it barely registers when he does so. His staffers promote his daughter\u2019s brand, he touts one of his resorts as a potential host site for next year\u2019s G7 summit, his Washington hotel becomes a marker for foreign and domestic allies to pay tribute \u2014 the accretion of small violations gradually implicates the entire party establishment.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to run his business throughout his presidency is closely linked to his decision to keep his financial information private. Nobody knows just how Trump made his money or who is paying him now. And while Republicans have an ideological incentive to defend other gross aspects of Trump\u2019s persona \u2014 like his racism and authoritarianism, which are all inflated versions of endemic tendencies within the conservative movement \u2014 they have no ideological incentive to defend his personal corruption. It would be easy for the party to break from Trump\u2019s extraordinary demands to conceal his tax returns and collect payments from interested parties. That makes it all the more crucial for Trump to lock in their support.\n\nTrump has been compared to a mobster by both his enemies and his friends. James Comey, who has faced off with organized crime, observed that Trump\u2019s leadership style eerily follows La Cosa Nostra. \u201cThe \u2014 the loyalty oaths, the boss as the dominant center of everything, it\u2019s all about how do you serve the boss, what\u2019s in the boss\u2019 interests,\u201d he recalled.\n\nOne of the key tools used by organized crime bosses is to implicate their underlings. It\u2019s hard to trust your flunkies until they have actively collaborated in your crimes. Once they have done so, they have demonstrated their willingness to violate the law on your behalf, and surrendered any claim to innocence. The point of asking Mike Pence to violate government ethics on Trump\u2019s behalf is not to put a few more dollars in Trump\u2019s pocket, but to put Mike Pence in his pocket.\n\nQuestioned about his decision by reporters, Pence gave two justifications. First, he said the Trump resort gave him a chance to visit long-lost Irish relatives who live nearby. In other words, Pence\u2019s own account is that he is locating a government delegation 150 miles away from his official meetings for personal reasons. Second, Pence argued that, because Trump himself has taken an official visit to the facility, the Secret Service gained familiarity with it, making it an especially good place to stay:\n\n.@realdonaldtrump took a side trip to his golf resort in Ireland this summer. Now, @vp cites Trump's trip as a justification for *his* trip there: after all, the Secret Service already knows the place! https://t.co/SX1ihj6Njr \u2014 David Fahrenthold (@Fahrenthold) September 3, 2019\n\nIt is the grift that keeps on grifting.\n\nThis post has been updated throughout.", "description": "President Trump asked Vice-President Mike Pence to stay at the Trump International Golf Club in Doonbeg, Ireland rather than Dublin for his meetings, despite the distance.
