Yet as Canada heads toward a general election, the prime minister has also become the subject of racist and Islamophobic conspiracy theories.\n\nAnd unlike the 2016 US election \u2013 in which a significant portion of online misinformation was created on Russian troll farms \u2013 much of the anti-Muslim propaganda aimed at Trudeau is produced and disseminated by Canadians.\n\nThe video of the YouTube imam, for example, was uploaded by a prominent Ontario anti-Muslim activist, and then viewed, shared and liked on at least three anti-Trudeau Facebook pages with a collective reach exceeding 185,000.\n\nDozens of videos on these pages are a conspiratorial pastiche in which Trudeau coddles Muslim extremists and throws open Canada\u2019s borders at the behest of George Soros. And they have been clicked almost 700,000 times.\n\nThe eddies of such online outrage sometimes spread into the real world. At a town hall meeting in January, an audience member accused Trudeau of supporting Sharia law \u2013 before intimating that he should be hanged for treason.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Recent polling suggests many Canadians are a politely jingoistic bunch who are inclined to believe that immigrants in general, and Muslims in particular, are too numerous above the 49th parallel.

Neither the conspiracy-mongering nor the threats have hampered the site\u2019s popularity. In 2016, it had 25,000 followers. Today it has nearly 235,000.\n\nThe conspiracies only heightened when the Liberals introduced a non-binding motion condemning \u201cIslamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination\u201d \u2013 a move which Trudeau\u2019s opponents on the fringe right were convinced was proof of his government\u2019s fealty to radical Islam.\n\nLiberal MP Iqra Khalid, the motion\u2019s sponsor, was inundated with hate mail and death threats. Meanwhile, Canada\u2019s statistical agency, found that police-reported hate crime targeting Muslims increased by 151% in 2017.\n\nNow Muslim groups found themselves in a unique situation: criticizing both Trudeau for donning brownface, as well as his enemies on the far right who say he is secretly Muslim.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Mislabeling someone as Muslim to castigate them is despicable. It engages in a longstanding hateful mythology about the Muslim community.\u2019 Illustration: Guardian Design/The Guardian\n\n\u201cIt was disheartening to see the Prime Minister engage in blackface/brownface,\u201d said Mustafa Farooq, Executive Director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims. \u201cThat said, mislabeling someone as Muslim to castigate them is despicable. It engages in a longstanding hateful mythology about the Muslim community.\u201d\n\nThat Canadians should be the source of this should not be a surprise: contrary to prevailing stereotypes, recent polling suggests many Canadians are a politely jingoistic bunch who are inclined to believe that immigrants in general, and Muslims in particular, are too numerous above the 49th parallel.\n\nOne poll,found 41% of Canadians believe there are too many immigrants in the country \u2013 and more than 60% of self-described Conservatives say there are too many visible minorities here.\n\nMany of the far right\u2019s most prominent provocateurs are Canadians, including Faith Goldy, Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern \u2013 who was banned from Facebook earlier this year.\n\nA 2018 report by the country\u2019s intelligence agency found that Canadians who hold extreme rightwing views \u2013 including Islamophobia, anti-immigration and white nationalism \u2013 actively use chat forums and social media.\n\n\u201cThese individuals leverage online chats and forums in attempt to create an online culture of fear, hatred and mistrust by exploiting real or imagined concerns,\u201d the report found.\n\n\u201cWe strongly expect much of this kind of content to be domestic,\u201d said Taylor Owen, director of the Digital Democracy Project, which is monitoring instances of mis- and disinformation ahead of the election. \u201cAs in the EU parliamentary elections, domestic groups saw the tools and tactics which worked for Russia in the US election and simply co-opted them.\u201d\n\nAll of this has kept fact-checkers busy. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the country\u2019s public broadcaster, has devoted seven journalists to fact check stories, ads, posts and other media that could have an impact on the election.\n\nEarlier this year, the AFP news agency debunked a widely circulated story which said the Trudeau government had \u201cpleaded\u201d the Nigerian government to send one million immigrants to Canada. (The same site had Trudeau making similar requests of six other countries.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, makes an election campaign stop in Surrey, British Columbia, on 24 September.
