That, in his view, would be good for both the advanced and the developing world.\n\nBacking: IMF boss Kristalina Georgieva said if the Boris Johnson's Brexit deal is approved by Parliament it would boost confidence and output across Britain and the EU\n\nSterling rose more than 1 per cent against the dollar to a five-month high of $1.2988 in the minutes after the deal was announced. But it then retreated amid fears the deal will be blocked by MPs.\n\nThe pound continued to swing wildly throughout the day as the perceived chances of a Brexit deal being passed ebbed and flowed. Georgieva said: 'Where there is a will there is a deal. I hope this holds in all quarters.'\n\nBusiness leaders in Britain also gave a cautious welcome.\n\nJonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: 'As MPs study the draft deal, they must keep firmly in mind the damage a disorderly exit could cause businesses large and small.\n\nA further extension offers no guarantees of avoiding this outcome, but if a passable deal is in touching distance then politicians on all sides should be pragmatic about giving us the time to get there.'\n\nAdam Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce said: 'For business, this deal may be the end of the beginning \u2013 but it is far from the beginning of the end of the Brexit process.'\n\nAdrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, said: 'Boris Johnson's announcement of a great new deal has gotten currency markets excited but investors should be wary, we have been here before and it didn't end well.'", "description": "The Bulgarian economist, who succeeded Christine Lagarde at the watchdog this month, said if the deal is approved by Parliament it would boost confidence and output across Britain and the EU.", "authors": ["Alex Brummer In Washington For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
