I thought, \u201cYou just don\u2019t get it, do you?\u201d\n\n\u2018You weren\u2019t moved, and whatever, but f**k you actually. F**k you all the way to the bank, actually.\u2019\n\nThe movie had Rami Malek win an Oscar for best actor for his role as Freddie Mercury.\n\n\u2018Bad reviews usually mean that it\u2019s going to be really successful,\u2019 Roger continued. \u2018I think people know a lot more than film critics, and the word of mouth via social media is so much more powerful than review from a guy who probably watches 40 movies a week, and has probably lost the essence of the joy of a movie.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBohemian Rhapsody made a whopping $903 million (\u00a3700 million) at the worldwide box office, and that already was an amazing feat.\n\nThe resemblance is uncanny (Picture: 20th Century Fox/Moviestore/REX)\n\nCritics thought the movie was too predictable (Picture: Richard E. Aaron/Redferns)\n\nThe movie doing well didn\u2019t stop Roger from holding a grudge against the critics who deemed the movie as predictable and typical.\n\nPredictable? We would hope so.\n\nAt least Roger isn\u2019t seething with anger on his own.\n\nGuitarist Brian May mentioned how he found the criticism of the movie \u2013 which had a 49 out of 100 on Metacritic \u2013 \u2018deeply disturbing\u2019.\n\n\u2018I found the public activity behind the whole awards season, and the behaviour of the media writers surrounding it, deeply disturbing,\u2019 he said. \u2018Vitriol and dishonesty, and blatant attempts to shame and influence the members into voting the way they, in their arrogance required them to.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not the fault of the awards panels \u2013 they stood up well. It\u2019s a kind of vindictive sickness that seems to have gripped public life.\u2019\n\nAudience reviews have been a lot better than critic ones, which is usually expected in this type of movie.\n\nThe bipic focused more on their music than Freddie\u2019s illness (Picture: A Bailey/20th Century Fox/Kobal/REX)\n\nOne critic said: \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody is a soulless, predictable, conventional and emotionally extortive musical biopic, although it\u2019s all hidden behind the songs and musical sequences.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, one viewer wrote: \u2018The music of Queen is such a collection of hits that this alone makes for a good time, but the movie is visually appealing as well.\n\n\u2018Rami Malek is fantastic along with the rest of the crew, good direction by Bryan Singer. This movie takes you on a wild ride right by the bands side, I loved the insight into their journey as a band.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
