That scheme ran between 2016 and 2018, with the Bristol Robotics Laboratory acting as one of its \"key technology partners\". The project developed a \"prototype modular robotic system\" which uses the brand name of JUVA.\n\n\n\nIn a statement issued on Saturday, the Bristol Robotics Laboratory's Praminda Caleb-Solly said that \"assistive robots\" could provide \"essential support for those who need help carrying out everyday tasks,\" enabling people to \"maintain their independence for as long as possible.\"\n\n\"But making sure we can trust these robots by reducing the risks associated with this technology is essential,\" Caleb-Solly added. \"Unlocking their full potential means they could assist with anything from physiotherapy to assistance for older people with mobility issues, improving people's quality of life significantly.\"\n\nSmart, innovative technology is now being used in a number of interesting ways in medicine. In September 2019, researchers at the University of Oxford announced they had developed artificial intelligence technology that could identify whether someone was at high risk of a fatal heart attack years before it occurs.", "description": "The way people are cared for in later life could be on the cusp of some significant changes.", "authors": ["Anmar Frangoul"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106207097-1572264164960gettyimages-1067907282.jpeg?v=1572264187", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
