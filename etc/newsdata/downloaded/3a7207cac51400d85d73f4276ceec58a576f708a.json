OK, the second season, was a bit more difficult but he tried, you know, and did his best to help the team. Then they decided to sack him and that\u2019s football.\n\n\u201cFor me, yes (they were too quick to sack him) because a manager like that comes and he needs a lot of players to do his own philosophy. He wanted to build his team and after two and a half years they decided to sack him because the results were not there.\n\n\u201cThey brought in one of the best managers in the world in Jose Mourinho, he wanted to build a team and they sacked him. It\u2019s not easy to build a team in that time, you need more than two years.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what they will do with this manager (Solskjaer)) but, for me, to win things and to improve, you need time. That\u2019s the problem with the coach and the direction, they have to find a solution together.\n\n\u201cNow you have a new manager, they wanted young players and that\u2019s what happens when you play with just young players. They will be up and down, up and down, that\u2019s football.\n\n\u201cOf course in football, you can\u2019t play with just young players, you need a mix. To win games, to win titles, to win big games you need experience. Of course you can win with young players but not every game.\u201d\n\nIt was Solskjaer who decided to sell Fellaini and even United legend Gary Neville claimed last weekend they would have been far better off with the Belgium international. They sold the big names of Romelu Lukaku and loaned Alexis Sanchez to bring in young players.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nFellaini was United\u2019s Plan B during his six years at Old Trafford, their go-to guy for big goals and they now miss his presence in midfield with Fred struggling, Paul Pogba looking unhappy and Scott McTominay unable to carry the team on his own.\n\nBut bigger than all of that, Fellaini is concerned about the way football is going in general.\n\n\u201cThey are like, they said, in transition, they want to build a team, but for a good team, you need time and to make the right decisions. You need the right players,\u201d said Fellaini.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always nice to receive a comment (from Gary Neville) like that. I did my time there, I won things, OK we didn\u2019t win the league but we finished second.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nFellaini helped United win an FA Cup, League Cup, the Europa League and their second place finish under Mourinho - which the manager was mocked for calling his greatest achievement - now looks completely different.\n\nBut Fellaini knew his time was up at Old Trafford when Solskjaer did not even pick him for the FA Cup games.\n\n\u201cThe players who left are players of experience,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the coach decided he didn't need them that\u2019s the choice of the coach. You cant judge the things of the coach. He decided he don\u2019t need Sanchez or Lukaku. That\u2019s his problem.\n\n\u201cNo he (Solskjaer) didn\u2019t have a conversation if I will play or not. I was thinking I would start in the FA Cup but I didn\u2019t because he put young players in. After that, in my mind I knew I would not be part of his team and I accept that, that\u2019s his choice. No problem.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nFellaini is now enjoying his new lease of life in China and watches from afar at his former clubs with the genuine hope things pick up for both United and Everton .\n\n\u201cI have only positive things to say about Chinese football, they have good players, they are improving every time because foreign players are coming, foreign managers, foreign directors and they want to improve because the president of China wants to go to the World Cup,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super happy here and I\u2019m improving always. I\u2019m happy with it because in England the intensity is super high, every year it gets higher and higher so it was a good change for me.\u201d", "description": "Fellaini, who was also let go by the Red Devils, believes they made a big error wielding the axe on Mourinho", "authors": ["John Cross", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20561004.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1036094258.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
