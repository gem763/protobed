It seems like a good idea, but any longer than 40 minutes in this hell-hole can be damaging for relationships,' she wrote in the post.\n\n'Even a snag on some s***ty bread with onions (on the bottom) isn't enough to take the edge off this Marriage Destroyer\u2122\ufe0f disguised as a DIY paradise.'\n\nA woman who took to Facebook to vent her frustration over a recent trip to Bunnings with her husband and kids said even a sausage and bread didn't take the edge off\n\nWhile she said the store seems to 'family-friendly with miniature trolleys for the kids and 'the promise of a playground' before long chaos descends.\n\n'Soon enough, while you are arguing over which length of hose you need, cart or no cart, wall-mounted or not, kink rating (settle down) and a multitude of attachments, they [the children] start to crack the s**ts,' she said.\n\n'But you've committed to this and they have to shut the hell up while you do this dance of decisions on a piece of f*****g pipe. That's the first hurdle.'\n\nThe mum said part of what makes shopping at the store so annoying was it's 'labyrinth-like' layout\n\nShe said the nuisance factor was compounded by the fact the store was laid out in such a manner it made finding what she needed an extremely difficult process.\n\n'The next one comes when you don't know if the goods you're after are in aisle 44 or aisle 2,' she said.\n\n'That's a lot of ground to cover, even if Stuart the helper was able to guide you through this labyrinth of pain.'\n\nAdding to her rising annoyance was the problem of having to manoeuvre a 'big flat trolley' which only has 'two wheels that move at the back'.\n\nWhile the store offers miniature trolley for the kids and even a playground, it doesn't take long for boredom to set in\n\n'So between aisle 44 and aisle 2 you are kneecapping strangers with this unwieldy beast and screeching at the kids to get out of your way,' she said.\n\n'Sure, someone will suggest you pull it backwards, but then there's the part where you NEED TO F*****G SEE WHERE YOU ARE GOING. Thanks for that advice, random stranger.'\n\nHer patience was tested further after she had to steer her children through the manure aisle.\n\n'The kids want to climb the bags of s**t and your eyes water as you try to figure out which sort of s**t to buy,' she said.\n\nA further 30 minutes was then spent by the couple trying to decide on the type of waste needed for the garden.\n\nThe gardening section of Bunnings is incredibly extensive which can make it very hard to choose exactly what you need\n\nBunnings, known for its extensive selection of plants, is a godsend - for some; for others, this is a form of torture.\n\n'Try picking plants as a couple at your peril. Native or ornamental? Edible or flowers? Succulent or delicate?' The woman said.\n\n'More kneecapping and twitchy kids who look dangerously close to smashing a pile of terracotta pots. That sausage seems like it happened decades ago.'\n\n'Try picking plants as a couple at your peril. Native or ornamental? Edible or flowers? Succulent or delicate?' The woman said\n\nAs well as the pressure of deciding on what greenery to purchase, the mum said she felt compelled buy a range of extras.\n\nThese included cheap portable air conditioners, an '$18 sawhorses', fire pits and bargain-priced buckets.'\n\n'You load up not thinking about how Crystal at the checkout is going to check you out,' she said.\n\n'The barcodes are hidden under 400 kilos of potting mix and s**t. Your bird netting is smashed between the cheap $30 door for your sawhorses and the piping for the strawberry patch.\n\nThe woman said that the trouble with shopping at the mega outlet was it is all too easy to load up on additional bargain priced extras\n\n'The kids are now thumping each other and reminding you why you always say that a trip to Bunnings is like sticking a knife in your eye on the weekend.\n\n'The Husband is staring at you like he wants to leave you for Crystal at the checkout.'\n\nThe woman said capping off the whole experience was the need to pack the car while trying to keep an eye on the kids as well as return the trolley to the bay and deal with frustrating drivers.\n\n'Then you get home and there's been a cool change, the sun is gone and you can't be f****d doing any gardening.\n\n'Bunnings. Who'd bother? F**k You.\n\nWhile the hardware store is a haven for the DIY enthusiast, it can be trying for even the most patient of partners\n\nHer post, which has garnered over 3,400 reactions, has struck a chord as well as prompting thousands to leave comments regaling their own tales of shopping at the store.\n\n'I think this was written from watching the security footage of our last visit to Bunnings,' one person joked.\n\nWhile another helpfully suggested the megastore install a 'bored s**tless' lounge for partners to wait in instead of having to endure being dragged around the shop.\n\n'Don't get me wrong I love Bunnings but when I go I'm in getting what I need maybe a quick look here and there then out,' they said.\n\n'When hubby is in his let's look at EVERYTHING mood we can be there forever.'", "description": "An Australian mum has unloaded with a hilarious rant listing all the reasons why she can't stand shopping at hardware retailer Bunnings.", "authors": ["Emilia Mazza For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/01/19420626-0-image-a-77_1570495089890.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
