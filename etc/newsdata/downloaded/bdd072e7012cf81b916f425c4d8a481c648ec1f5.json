The accounting standard setter gave private companies the option to amortize goodwill in 2014, and offered nonprofits that option in May this year. But public companies still have no alternative and have been largely following the same rules, which since 2001 have required them to test goodwill for potential impairment each year.\n\nThe FASB\u2019s latest research is focused on the goodwill rules\u2019 impact on public companies, but the board is considering making larger changes that would affect all companies, according to the FASB\u2019s invitation to comment.\n\nDuring the period, the FASB received a total of 95 letters, including ones from International Business Machines Corp. , Ford Motor Co. , Verizon Communications Inc., Eli Lilly & Co., Chevron Corp. and Cummins Inc.\n\nThe majority of companies that provided feedback for the study said the goodwill rule has room for improvement and that the FASB\u2019s updates over the years have simplified the process. But some went further in their critiques to say that associated costs outweigh any possible benefits. While public companies have expressed grievances with the rules in the past, the board is now seriously considering addressing those concerns.\n\nThe FASB is hosting a public roundtable to discuss the feedback on Nov. 15. In a statement, a FASB spokeswoman said the input \u201cwill help the board determine what direction it should take at this early stage of the project.\u201d\n\nEngine maker Cummins continued to incur costs associated with hiring third-party valuation experts, developing cash-flow forecasts and determining discount rates for its annual goodwill impairment test, the Columbus, Ind.-based company\u2019s controller, Christopher Clulow, wrote in a statement.\n\nA qualitative screen, which the FASB incorporated into the standard to reduce the cost to perform the goodwill impairment test in 2011, isn\u2019t enough, he said. \u201cEven performing the qualitative screen can still prove to be costly and time-consuming due to the documentation required and review by the auditors,\u201d Mr. Clulow wrote.\n\nCigna, the Bloomfield, Conn.-based health insurer, found the current standard \u201coperationally cumbersome,\u201d citing the time spent on the required documentation, review time examining the inputs and outputs, and an external auditor\u2019s involvement, Cigna\u2019s chief accounting officer, Mary Terese Agoglia Hoeltzel, wrote.\n\nThe FASB previously received feedback from companies requesting additional disclosures on goodwill and intangible assets to improve transparency. But New York-based Verizon, for one, said proposed additional disclosures on key performance assumptions and targets would introduce even more costs on a continuing basis.\n\nThe disclosures would also run counter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s recent push to simplify disclosures, Tracy Krause, Verizon\u2019s vice president of accounting and external reporting, wrote.\n\nRespondents also offered suggestions for improving goodwill. To reduce the goodwill rule\u2019s subjectivity, Ford recommended the amortization of goodwill over a default period and testing for goodwill upon a triggering event instead of annually, wrote Julie Garity, the Dearborn, Mich., automaker\u2019s director of global accounting policy.\n\nWrite to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com", "description": "Company executives, in recent comment letters to the Financial Accounting Standards Board, say the rules on goodwill have saddled them with unnecessary costs and are too subjective.", "authors": ["Mark Maurer"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-116403/social", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
