During the session, the details of which have not been previously disclosed, Cairncross in turn sought the perspective of the American media for a report, commissioned by then-Prime Minister Theresa May, on the fate of journalism in the digital age.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe meeting was part of an ongoing campaign by news publishers in the U.S. and Europe to counter the growing power of Silicon Valley \u2014 a significant, if often overlooked, aspect of the anti-tech backlash brewing on both sides of the Atlantic. And it comes amid an existential struggle for most U.S. news companies, at a time when Google and Facebook control 60 percent of online ad dollars and can decide the fate of newsrooms by tweaking their algorithms.\n\nThe news companies\u2019 efforts have taken many forms, including complaints with regulators and lawmakers in multiple countries about tech\u2019s alleged antitrust or copyright violations. But the American publishers\u2019 major focus at the moment is persuading Congress to grant them an exemption from antitrust law, which would let them combine forces to negotiate the terms of the online platforms\u2019 use of their news content.\n\nThat effort, which recently got a plug from Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, echoes the tactic behind a new European Union copyright directive that gives publishers greater economic leverage against tech. That EU law is the result of years of hit-or-miss efforts to combat what the media companies call a Google-Facebook \"digital duopoly.\"\n\nMorning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

No one publisher, even a really big publisher, in itself can impact the relationship with the platforms. You need everybody to coordinate.\u201d\n\nThe combatants include some of the media industry\u2019s biggest players \u2014 among them the major German publisher Axel Springer SE as well as News Corp., the U.S. company founded by Rupert Murdoch that owns Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal. (Axel Springer is the co-owner, along with POLITICO, of POLITICO Europe.) The involvement of such media powerhouses has inspired some eye-rolling among some Silicon Valley defenders in Washington, even if the vast majority of U.S. newsrooms have spent the past decade in an economic free fall.\n\n\u201cIf only somebody would help Rupert Murdoch,\u201d quipped Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel of the tech trade group NetChoice, whose members include Facebook and Google.\n\nChavern, a former U.S. Chamber of Commerce executive, has repeatedly traveled to Europe to learn from his EU counterparts about their combat with tech. During a January trip to Berlin, he met with VG Media, a so-called collecting society that serves as a clearinghouse for fees owed to news publishers, and sat down with Axel Springer\u2019s chief lobbyist, Dietrich von Klaeden.\n\nChavern said he plans to head back to the continent in the fall.\n\nMeanwhile, von Klaeden has been to the United States more than a half-dozen times over the past year to explain the European media strategy and make the case for changes in Washington, he told POLITICO Europe in an interview.\n\nVon Klaeden has spread the message in the U.S. that when it comes to news publishers' dealings with Google and Facebook, it's possible to \"get the dollar to change direction.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for the U.S. to maintain the momentum,\u201d said von Klaeden, who sits on the News Media Alliance\u2019s board.\n\nIn February, shortly after Chavern returned from Europe, Cairncross issued the results of her investigation into the state of the British news industry. Among the conclusions of the 160-page report were that \u201cthe government must take steps to ensure the position of Google and Facebook does not do undue harm to publishers.\"\n\nMagazines and newspapers of German publisher Axel Springer. | Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nThe publishers' efforts in the EU have already borne fruit. This spring, amid an intense lobbying campaign by the media and other industries, the European Parliament and European Council in Brussels adopted sweeping copyright legislation that includes a so-called publisher\u2019s right provision, giving news organizations the right to demand payment for the small snippets of news that appear on Google News and elsewhere. Critics call it a \u201clink tax.\u201c\n\nEuropean media had years of misfires before getting some traction against the major internet companies. In 2014, Spain passed a law requiring payments to Spanish publications whose content populated Google News. Google reacted by shuttering the service there, and it remains closed.\n\nBut unlike in the Spanish case, publishers say that under the new EU-wide regulation, they\u2019ll be in a position to trade payments for other concessions from the tech platforms, such as access to data collected on their digital audiences. (EU member states have two years from the date of passage to enshrine the directive into their national laws.)\n\nIn the U.S., the News Media Alliance is throwing its lobbying efforts behind a bill that would give publishers a time-limited exemption from antitrust law, allowing them to negotiate together to make content deals with online providers without being charged with illegal collusion.\n\nThe legislation represents a major change in the media companies\u2019 strategy: Until recently, individual American publishers attempted to negotiate one-off, ad hoc deals with Google and Facebook in attempts to extract more money or more online readership data on better terms. It was, they say, an unsatisfying experience.\n\nOne thing going for American news organizations is that in the wake of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, both Democrats and Republicans began turning on Google and Facebook over everything from Russian election interference to the proliferation of online hate speech to, in the GOP's case, unproven allegations of anti-conservative bias.\n\nThat anger is beginning to manifest itself in concrete action in Washington. In late July, the Justice Department announced a broad antitrust review of the major tech platforms; a person familiar with the situation said the media companies\u2019 grievances are on the DOJ\u2019s radar. A day later, after being hit by a $5 billion privacy fine from the Federal Trade Commission, Facebook disclosed that it was the subject of a new FTC antitrust investigation.\n\nAt least one media mogul isn't waiting for regulators to take notice of the news industry's unhappiness. News Corp. has in recent years complained to the European Commission about Google\u2019s scraping of its news and has argued to Australian authorities that Silicon Valley firms need to be more heavily regulated. Last summer, the company urged the FTC to look into whether any of the online platforms are behaving like a \u201cbottleneck monopolist\u201d by dictating what kind of relationship news outlets have with their digital audiences.\n\nNews Corp. is also a member of the News Media Alliance and sits on its board. But Chavern said his group isn\u2019t pinning its hopes on federal antitrust regulators in the U.S., whose investigations can take years to wrap up. (An FTC antitrust case against the chip maker Qualcomm begun in January of 2017 is still ongoing.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking the government to do anything other than leave us alone,\u201d said Chavern. \u201cI\u2019m trying to drive an immediate solution for news publishers to build a sustainable future.\u201d\n\nStill, the group has taken advantage of Congress' growing interest in cracking down on tech companies to press its agenda.\n\nRep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), chairman of the House Judiciary Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee, chose to devote the first hearing of his wide-ranging tech industry investigation to the fate of the \u201cfree and diverse press.\u201d Cicilline used the June hearing to call attention to the News Media Alliance\u2019s proposed antitrust exemption, which he is sponsoring in the House.\n\nIn the Senate, the backers of the bipartisan legislation are Louisiana Republican John Neely Kennedy and Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.\n\nWhile getting any legislation through Congress at the moment is an uphill task, the House bill has gotten traction on the presidential campaign trail with Sanders, who linked to the measure in a recent op-ed, saying, \"We must also explore new ways to empower media organizations to collectively bargain with these tech monopolies.\"\n\nAnd the tech industry is seeing the push for the antitrust exemption as enough of a threat to quietly lobby against it. That\u2019s in part because the country\u2019s publishers are a unique kind of Silicon Valley critic, with built-in high public profiles and longstanding political connections.\n\n2020 Dems on the issues \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\nTechnology: Online Privacy Social Media\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to the news industry as it works to adapt to the new economics of the internet,\u201d a Google spokesperson said in a statement, saying the company drives tens of billions of clicks to news sites that spur ad revenue and subscriptions.\n\nFacebook declined to comment on the record, but a person familiar with the company\u2019s thinking said it believes that the proposed media antitrust exemption could lead to the sort of news blackouts that sometimes result from the breakdown in negotiations over cable programming.\n\nThe internet giants have lately touted a series of initiatives to work more closely with the media. In March 2018, for example, Google said it was putting $300 million into a \u201cGoogle News Initiative,\u201d which provides funding, training and digital tools to local news outlets. Facebook, meanwhile, is planning to launch a \u201cnews tab\u201d under which the company will reportedly pay publishers for content.\n\nTo support the U.S. legislation, the News Media Alliance is connecting lawmakers with representatives of their local newspapers to make their case.\n\nKevin Riley, the editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said he overcame the awkwardness of getting engaged in politics to talk to Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on House Judiciary, about the challenges facing his paper in the digital era. (Collins is a co-sponsor of the media antitrust bill.)\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be in a position that you\u2019re lobbying people you cover, but I wanted him to know how important it was,\u201d said Riley, who also testified at Cicilline\u2019s hearing in June.\n\nRiley said he stopped short of asking Collins to support the exemption: \u201cThe [News Media] Alliance can take it from there.\u201d\n\nCritics of the bills say Congress has been rightly reluctant to create loopholes in the country\u2019s antitrust rules. And, they say, an exemption for publishers has been tried in the past, without much success. In 1970, President Richard Nixon signed an exemption allowing local news publishers to enter into joint operating agreements, which allowed competing newspapers in the same city to combine their business operations while maintaining separate newsrooms.\n\nSome opponents charge that the move only shored up entrenched media giants to the detriment of up-and-coming outlets.\n\n\u201cGenerally, society as a whole abhors cartels. So why pass a statute to create one?\u201d said Jonathan Jacobson, a former member of the congressionally mandated Antitrust Modernization Commission, which warned in 2007 against such exemptions. (Jacobson, a lawyer in private practice, has Google as a client, though he said he isn\u2019t speaking for it.)\n\nBut advocates for the measure say that times and circumstances have changed \u2014 and that newspapers and other media outlets, though crucial to American democracy, are in the untenable position of competing for revenue with the online platforms that distribute their content.\n\n\u201cI think the bargaining power between any individual publisher and a tech platform is just too vast,\u201d said Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, an advocacy group critical of the tech industry.\n\nThe News Media Alliance had a high-profile misstep in its U.S. campaign. A study it released in June, which was featured in The New York Times, asserted that Google made about $4.7 billion off news publishers\u2019 content in 2018. That number met with immediate skepticism, and the director of Harvard\u2019s Nieman Journalism Lab called the figure \u201cimaginary.\u201d\n\nBut the group says it's seeing the political winds in the U.S. blowing in its favor. Chavern said board members recently told him they were encouraged to see the traction the group's campaign is getting, urging him to \"punch the gas.\u201d\n\nMatthew Karnitschnig contributed to this report.", "description": "U.S. news companies are using a playbook from Europe to challenge the online platforms they see as an existential threat.", "authors": ["Nancy Scola", "Margaret Harding Mcgill"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/74/dd/da7d164e4c13977660f2bb076b32/19829-fb-gty-773.jpg"}
