First came Trump\u2019s suggestion that other nations should be responsible for protecting maritime transit through the Hormuz Strait or reimburse the United States for doing so. He subsequently questioned the one-sided nature of the U.S.-Japan alliance, saying, \u201cIf we\u2019re attacked, Japan doesn\u2019t have to help us at all.\u201d\n\nThough Trump is unlikely to take action on either topic, his comments concern U.S. allies since they are consistent with decades of remarks fixating on the cost rather than the purpose of American military forces and operations overseas. For instance, the recent U.S.-South Korea Special Measures Agreement (\u201cburden-sharing\u201d) negotiations were more contentious than usual, fueled by Washington\u2019s demands for exponential increases in Seoul\u2019s reimbursement for stationing U.S. forces there.\n\nThose negotiations concluded with only an 8 percent increase in South Korea\u2019s contribution, but with the requirement to renegotiate annually instead of every five years. Next year\u2019s negotiations with both South Korea and Japan will occur under the cloud of this year\u2019s demands for a 100 percent increase or even Trump\u2019s \u201ccost plus 50 percent.\u201d The focus on monetary compensation reflects Trump\u2019s transactional view of alliances and stationing U.S. forces overseas.\n\nTrump and Kim Jong-un\u2019s exchange of \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cexcellent content\u201d letters has fueled speculation of an imminent return to summit diplomacy. A media article even suggested a possible surprise photo op between the two leaders when Trump travels to the demilitarized zone during his trip to South Korea. Both Washington and Seoul denied any meeting is scheduled.\n\nWashington does hope, however, for a resumption of working-level meetings. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo commented that there is a \u201cvery real possibility\u201d of America resuming talks with North Korea \u201cat a moment\u2019s notice.\u201d But Pyongyang rejected numerous attempts by Special Envoy Stephen Biegun for dialogue to add meat to the bare bones of the year-old Singapore Summit statement.\n\nBiegun recently admitted that despite two summits, there is still not even a common definition of denuclearization. His statement contradicts repeated claims by Pompeo that Kim privately accepted the United Nations definition of denuclearization as well as the complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of his nuclear and missile programs and arsenal.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s visit to Seoul after the G20, the U.S. will seek to reassure South Korea that, despite the lack of progress, it remains committed to a diplomatic resolution of the nuclear crisis. Washington must concurrently strive to brace Seoul to maintain rigorous sanctions enforcement. There now appears to be less tension in the bilateral relationship since President Moon Jae-in is pushing less forcefully for a reduction or exemptions to international sanctions to enable inter-Korean economic projects.\n\nHowever, South Korea\u2019s self-appointed role as a go-between for Washington and Pyongyang has been eclipsed by China. Kim\u2019s recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, while refusing dialogue at any level with Seoul, reflects how sidelined President Moon has become. Pyongyang dismissed Seoul as an \u201cobsequious mediator\u201d and even rejected South Korean offers of humanitarian assistance as \u201cinsulting.\u201d The South Korean government, surprised by the outcome in the Hanoi summit, is now at a loss on how to proceed.\n\nKim Jong-un seeks to negotiate an arms control agreement that caps rather than eliminates his nuclear and missile programs, akin to a North Korean START agreement. According to North Korean documents, Kim told his generals that talks with the United States were \u201cthe first step to elevating North Korea\u2019s status as a global nuclear-capable state.\u201d Prior to the Hanoi summit, Kim said the goal of dialogue with Washington was to \u201cobtain the ultimate result\u201d of being recognized as a nuclear weapons state.\n\nTrump must resist the temptation to prematurely agree to another summit with North Korea. Through presidential letters and other means, Washington should emphasize to Pyongyang that productive working-level meetings must precede another leader meeting.\n\nWashington should also emphasize that the maligned \u201cbig deal\u201d it offered in Hanoi is only what North Korea is required to do under eleven UN resolutions and what Pyongyang already committed to doing in eight previous international denuclearization agreements.\n\nThat said, such an expansive agreement can be implemented in phases. The Trump administration has issued conflicting public messages on whether total denuclearization must precede any sanctions relief. Private discussions with U.S. officials have also provided contradictory depictions of an acceptable agreement. The Trump administration should more clearly articulate the parameters of a comprehensive agreement that fulfills UN resolution requirements while providing a path to reducing UN sanctions.\n\nTrump must carefully balance resolute action against Chinese, Iranian, and North Korean transgressions with affirming strong support for U.S. allies and maintaining U.S. forces in the region. That\u2019s no small challenge. His messaging to date has often undercut coherent U.S. policies.", "description": "While Donald Trump is in Asia, Japanese and South Korean leaders will no doubt seek clarity on his views about alliance responsibilities and his strategy regarding North Korea.", "authors": ["Bruce Klingner", "Senior Research Fellow", "Northeast Asia", "Bruce Klingner Specializes In Korean", "Japanese Affairs As The Senior Research Fellow For Northeast Asia."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-07/GettyImages-1152691942.jpg?itok=v3F0gWi0"}
