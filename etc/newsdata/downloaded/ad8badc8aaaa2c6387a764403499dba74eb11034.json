AT&T May Now Rally to Our Next Targets", "language": "en", "text": "AT&T Inc. ( T ) is in the news Monday with reports that Elliott Management is now the owner of $3.2 billion worth of T. In addition, Elliott Management sent a letter to the board of the company outlining steps to lift the stock price to $60 or more by the end of 2021. We were positive on the stock back in late June , noting that \"Traders and investors should consider going long T at current levels and on strength. Risk below $30 looking for gains to the $38-$42 area in the months ahead.\"\n\nWith T reaching the bottom-end of our target price, a new look at the charts seems in order.\n\nIn this updated daily bar chart of T, below, we can see a bullish set-up leading into Monday's gap to the upside. Prices have been in an uptrend from the late December nadir. T is above the rising 50-day moving average line and last month the slope of the 200-day line turned positive.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been in an uptrend from December and has made new highs with the price action. The buying of $3.2 billion in stock has obviously pushed up the OBV line. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a bullish configuration above the zero-line.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of T, below, we can see that the bulls are in control. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line is pointed up and so is the MACD oscillator. All are bullish.\n\nIn the weekly close-only Point and Figure chart of T, below, we can see a lot of price history. A weekly close at $38 or higher will give us an upside breakout on this chart and open the way to a projected $55 price target.\n\nBottom line strategy: If you took our recommendation to buy T back on June 28 you are in the driver's seat. Now $41 and then $55 are our next price targets. Enjoy. Risk a close below $34.50 now.", "description": "If you took our recommendation to buy T on June 28, you are in the driver's seat, and now $41 and then $55 are our next price targets....T", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Did You Hear Our Call", "At T May Now Rally To Our Next Targets", "If You Took Our Recommendation To Buy T On June", "You Are In The Driver'S Seat", "Now", "Then", "Are Our Next Price Targets.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/9538d1be-d31a-11e9-805f-8f2ce1338f34.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
