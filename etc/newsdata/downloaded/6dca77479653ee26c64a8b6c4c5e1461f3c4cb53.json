Instead, Don King was eating a plateful of ribs, making those waiting on him in Las Vegas very anxious. It was only a bit of the gamesmanship that went on in one of the most significant fights promoted by the two leading promoters in boxing history.\n\nKing and Felix Trinidad were supposed to be in Las Vegas for an early evening news conference to push the upcoming bout between Trinidad and Oscar De La Hoya, the 1992 Olympic gold medal winner and the star, at the time, of promoter Bob Arum\u2019s stable.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDe La Hoya and Trinidad were unbeaten welterweight champions, each with a legitimate claim to the 147-pound throne, and a combined 66-0 record with 55 knockouts.\n\nThe intrigue in the fight was obvious. It pitted De Le Hoya, the boxer, versus Trinidad, the powerful slugger. It was De La Hoya, the wildly popular Mexican-American star, versus Trinidad, the idol of millions in Puerto Rico.\n\nAnd perhaps most of all, it was a battle of boxing\u2019s most intense and long-running rivalry, Bob Arum versus Don King.\n\n\u201cMost of my fights were in the heavyweight division, but there were a couple of guys at that time who were very popular and you knew could do big numbers,\u201d King told Yahoo Sports on Wednesday. \u201cJulio Cesar Chavez was an idol in Mexico and we did that massive crowd [of over 130,000 in Mexico City] there with [Greg Haugen]. He was a fighter of the people. And then there was Oscar and Tito. They were two really good fighters and they had a great rivalry and there was that Mexican and Puerto Rican rivalry there and the thing with me and old \u2018Lonesome Bob,\u2019 and it just clicked.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bout was something of a litmus test about how non-heavyweights could do on pay-per-view. Pay-per-view, in the form it is known now, wasn\u2019t quite 10 years old in 1999. It debuted on April 19, 1991, when TVKO, HBO Sports\u2019 pay-per-view arm, put on a heavyweight title fight between George Foreman and Evander Holyfield in Atlantic City.\n\nDe La Hoya-Trinidad wasn\u2019t a heavyweight fight on the scales, as combined their 294 pounds were only slightly more than the 257 Foreman weighed eight years earlier when he fought Holyfield. But their bout was a heavyweight attraction at the box office and probably the most compelling non-heavyweight match in the sport since Sugar Ray Leonard fought Marvelous Marvin Hagler for the middleweight title 12 years earlier.\n\nThe 20th anniversary of the day that, as King gleefully put it on Sept. 18, 1999, \u201cthe lights went out in Arumville,\u201d is one that still makes De La Hoya\u2019s stomach flip.\n\n\u201cThat fight haunts me every single day of my life,\u201d De La Hoya told Yahoo Sports on Wednesday. \u201cJesus. It\u2019s a tough one for me to talk about even now. Not a day goes by that people don\u2019t bring it up to me. Of course, they tell me that they think I won, but still \u2026 \u201d\n\nHis voice trails off, his disappointment at the controversial majority decision that favored Trinidad still gnawing at him.\n\nOscar De La Hoya congratulates Felix Trinidad following their welterweight championship bout at the Mandalay Bay Events Center on Sept. 18, 1999 in Las Vegas.

King was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1997 and Arum in 1994. De La Hoya and Trinidad went in together in 2014, while judge Jerry Roth was inducted in 2017.\n\nRoth had one of the two scorecards that infuriated many who saw the fight. He favored Trinidad, 115-113. Bob Logist scored it 115-114 for Trinidad, while judge Glen Hamada had it 114-114.\n\nThe fight was De La Hoya\u2019s to win, but he inexplicably ran the final three rounds and threw next-to-no punches.\n\nDe La Hoya was trained for the Trinidad fight by another Hall of Famer, the late Gil Clancy. De La Hoya was boxing well and scoring, and told Yahoo Sports on Wednesday he felt he could have stopped Trinidad down the stretch had he fought differently.\n\nBut Clancy was among the greatest trainers of all time and his instructions in the corner were to do anything but engage with Trinidad.\n\nDe La Hoya obeyed instructions and it led to the most disappointing loss of his career.\n\n\u201cI swear to you, my trainer, Gil, he was almost slapping me in the corner and was yelling at me, \u2018Get out of the way and box; do not stand in front of him,\u2019\u201d De La Hoya said. \u201cI was hearing it almost every round when I\u2019d go back to the corner. I think in those last three rounds, if I\u2019d have stood in front of him, Gil Clancy might have knocked me out.\u201d\n\nWhen ring announcer Michael Buffer called Trinidad\u2019s name as the winner, Mandalay Bay erupted and King exulted.\n\nHe\u2019d won what would turn out to be the biggest non-heavyweight bout in boxing to that point. The fight did 1.4 million on pay-per-view, then a record for non-heavyweights, and revenue was higher than expected across the board.\n\nKing crowed at Arum at the post-fight news conference and insisted the contracts be flipped for the rematch since Trinidad had won. De La Hoya, as the bigger star, had gotten more in the first fight. Arum refused and they never fought again.\n\nKing was cackling and mocking Arum so much at the news conference, referring to him repeatedly as \u201cLonesome Bob,\u201d that Arum ordered publicist Bill Caplan to end the proceedings. Caplan pulled the plug on King\u2019s microphone as King repeatedly bellowed, \u201cThe lights are out in Arumville!\u201d\n\nKing held his own news conference at the Las Vegas Hilton the next day, where a massive Puerto Rican flag flew in front.\n\n\u201cThere should have been a rematch, but that\u2019s Bob, you know?\u201d King said. \u201cYou saw how mad he was. If things weren\u2019t his way, if you added your own style or flair or personal interpretation, \u2018Lonesome Bob,\u2019 couldn\u2019t take it. He was a my-way-or-the-highway kind of a guy. I\u2019m a promoter for the people and of the people, and I think that common person\u2019s touch is what led to my success.\n\n\u201cBut that fight was a good fight, but Oscar didn\u2019t want to get in there at the end. Most people don\u2019t remember how good the fight was, because all they remember was Arum pulling the microphone off of me and then not doing the rematch.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The 20th anniversary of the day that, as King gleefully put it on Sept. 18, 1999, \u201cthe lights went out in Arumville,\u201d is one that still makes De La Hoya\u2019s stomach flip.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/X.sw0oR0_yTCZLU48rOJPA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD02ODkuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RKoivCbLyMjeRYJRqXDmpg--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MzM0NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/cdccbc90-da70-11e9-b5f7-d12d516cfd08", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
