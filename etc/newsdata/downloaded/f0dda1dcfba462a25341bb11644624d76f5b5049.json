The boy was reportedly in stable condition with a gunshot wound to the leg as of Monday afternoon.\n\nThe South China Morning Post (SCMP) described video that showed the plainclothes officer getting into a \u201cquarrel\u201d with protesters in which he was \u201cattacked from behind by a masked man,\u201d knocked to the ground, and beaten.\n\nThe officer fired a shot to disperse the crowd \u2013 evidently the shot that struck the young boy in the leg \u2013 and was then set on fire by a gasoline bomb that detonated at his feet. The officer dropped his gun while attempting to beat out the flames, but later \u201ctook it back with force\u201d after a protester tried to pick it up.\n\nAccording to a source in the police department, the warning shot only hit the boy because a protester stuck the officer\u2019s arm while he was trying to fire in the air.\n\nAnother video showed the officer with blood on his face making a phone call for help, only to have another gasoline bomb detonate near him. The officer\u2019s car was reportedly vandalized and pushed onto the train tracks. The officer was later treated for burns across two percent of his body.\n\nSCMP cited criticism that the plainclothes officer in question ran several people down with his car before the confrontation in which he was beaten, but no video evidence of this had been produced as of Monday.\n\nProtesters who were already angry about the shooting of an 18-year-old student last week became even more furious as news of the 14-year-old\u2019s injury spread. The L.A. Times quoted some demonstrators who talked about overwhelming Lam\u2019s emergency laws through sheer numbers, confronting the authorities with hundreds of thousands of people wearing \u201cillegal\u201d masks and daring the police to arrest or shoot them all. The L.A. Times reported:\n\n\u201cCarrie Lam wants to turn Hong Kong into China. This is only the start. Next, they censor the media, monitor our communications online, reporting people,\u201d said Samuel, 18, a protester in a full-face mask who, like other protesters, asked not to use his full name for protection from authorities. \u201cWe have no way to keep ourselves safe anymore.\u201d [\u2026] \u201cCarrie Lam is declaring war on us with this law. If she wants a war, bring it on,\u201d said Emma, 22, a protester in jeans and a black surgical mask. \u201cShe thinks she\u2019s the queen of Hong Kong but now she\u2019s only Xi Jinping\u2019s puppet. If we burn, she burns with us.\u201d \u201cOf all the available options, you can always trust the government to choose the worst one,\u201d said June, 32, who said she didn\u2019t usually protest but had stepped out of her office to join the crowds. \u201cThey have no idea how to de-escalate the situation and I\u2019m afraid of what will happen next.\u201d Charles, 38, an office worker in a buttoned-up shirt and a surgical mask, said he planned to wear a mask every day from now on. \u201cPeople will find creative ways to circumvent it, like saying they\u2019re sick or the air quality is bad or they\u2019re wearing religious dress,\u201d he said. \u201cGiving herself and the police more power won\u2019t restore order. It\u2019ll only lead to greater uprising.\u201d\n\nAn editorial at the Hong Kong Free Press on Monday pointed out that the authorities have a habit of announcing all use of force by the police, including the use of lethal ammunition, was fully justified before the incidents are investigated, which fuels the long-standing protest movement complaint that the police cannot be trusted to investigate themselves.\n\n\u201cWe may hope that the shooting will still be investigated. But the person handed this tricky job will undertake it knowing that his superiors want a particular result. Producing the wrong outcome may well blight his or her prospects in the force,\u201d the editorial noted.\n\nProtest marches continued throughout the weekend despite bad weather, roadblocks, railway stations closing, tear gas, rubber bullets, and water cannon. Widespread vandalism against businesses owned by mainland Chinese or supportive of Beijing was reported.\n\n\u201cHong Kong police attempt to murder. Our gov is killing us,\u201d read banners carried by the protesters, alluding to the two police shootings thus far. The previous protest chant of \u201cFive Demands, Not One Less\u201d was updated over the weekend to mention six demands, the new demand being \u201cdisband the police force.\u201d\n\nNearly all of the demonstrators wore masks in defiance of Lam\u2019s mask ban, in some cases resorting to improvised face coverings such as paper bags with eye holes or even their own braided hair. Pro-democracy lawmakers tried to file an injunction against the mask ban, but it was rejected by the Hong Kong High Court on Sunday.\n\nThe People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) became involved in the protests for the first time over the weekend, raising a yellow warning flag over its East Kowloon Barracks and shining spotlights on demonstrators. The yellow flag was meant to warn protesters that they could be arrested for shining laser pointers on the barracks, but dozens of them did it anyway.\n\nChina\u2019s state-run Global Times hammered the protesters with a string of editorials over the weekend, denouncing them as \u201cblack-clad Western puppets\u201d on a \u201crampage.\u201d\n\nThe Global Times complained that Western media and politicians found time to denounce Lam\u2019s mask ban but none to condemn the violent actions of the \u201crioters.\u201d\n\n\u201cWashington only views the Pearl of the Orient as a political tool designed to contain the Chinese mainland. If the protesters could reach a proper level of sobriety, then they would easily see through such amateur tricks,\u201d the Global Times sneered.\n\nAnother editorial castigated the \u201crioters\u201d for attacking \u201ccivilians,\u201d including journalists covering the protests.\n\n\u201cRioters have continued assaulting ordinary Hong Kong residents who hold different political views or oppose their illegal acts as the hit-and-run mob reached a new height of lawlessness,\u201d a third Global Times editorial said on Monday, accusing the protest movement of \u201cdepriving the public of free movement\u201d by blockading streets.\n\n\u201cBeating ordinary people who do not agree with rioters has become a common sight amid illegal demonstrations. The Global Times reporters witnessed that if passerby holds different views or gets into a spat with protesters, he may end up being brutally thrashed,\u201d the paper claimed.", "description": "Hong Kong police shot a 14-year-old boy on Friday as protests continued, growing more intense after a ban on masks was announced.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1173908547-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
