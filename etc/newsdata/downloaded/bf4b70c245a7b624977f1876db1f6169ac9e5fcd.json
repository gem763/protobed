In song, and on stage and screen, the sorrows of love absorb far more fodder than its moments of elation and joy. Still, it is the joy of love that makes all the struggle worthwhile, and knowing that someone is at one\u2019s side through every darkness develops the sense of purpose and unity in life. All these themes are part of this week's exquisitely created Episode 4 of Season 3 of \u201cThe Good Doctor,\u201d \u201cTake My Hand,\u201d airing October 14.\n\nDr. Claire Brown (Antonia Thomas) is on duty, not taking a single day off or daring to mention that her mother has died in a fatal car crash. The dedicated surgical resident is also not even dealing with her own feelings of responsibility in the loss or working toward self-forgiveness. Instead, she is drowning herself in work while some very raw emotions are on the surface.\n\nDr. Shaun Murphy and Dr.\n\nCarly Lever (Freddie Highmore and Jasika Nicole) are finding more and more in common in their young relationship, and even feel fine about sharing kisses during television commercials. Another simple gesture of connection, however, becomes a hurdle. Carly sees holding hands as necessary support and symbol of affection in their union. Shaun only feels the discomfort of such physical closeness.\n\nShaun\u2019s mentor, Dr.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news! Click on the topic you interest most.

TV Shows\n\nGlassman (Richard Schiff) has to move past his own discomfort of the unknown and doubt to marry Debbie (Sheila Kelley), two untypical patients present their own issues in love, trust, and pain.\n\nHigh-profile patient and following the proposal\n\nIt\u2019s a fun twist for fans to see Joshua Malina from \u201cScandal\u201d as the high-profile, prominent conspiracy theorist, Mitchell Stewart, as a patient in San Jose St.\n\nBonaventure Hospital, and he isn't taking any chances with his care. He is surrounded by a full staff and tells all of his attending physicians that he has no trust in their expertise. A lovely moment arises when Dr. Murphy relates that lulling a body into complete sedation before \u201ccutting you open\u201d requires that \u201cyou trust us just a little.\u201d\n\nDr. Murphy becomes the one doctor whom Mitchell trusts because he can't lie.\n\nWhen \u201cThe Good Doctor,\u201d says \u201cI can lie,\u201d meaning as an actual act itself, Dr. Park (Will Yun Lee) interjects, \u201cbut not successfully\u201d to seal the deal. Stewart is convinced that he is being poisoned when his liver is not showing improvement even after surgery. Shaun is on the case, and it's not long until Stewart himself is made the culprit, consuming high levels of a problem ingredient in his herbal supplements.\n\nDr. Murphy also makes a point to debunk the touted link between vaccines and autism, as well as probing into some of the reasons for his patient\u2019s far-flung concepts.\n\nAaron Glassman lets his fear of failure get in the way of future happiness as he waits with Debbie at the courthouse. He panics after she tells him about her time in the Merchant Marine (and snoring). He seeks Shaun\u2019s counsel about remarriage. Shaun is honored by this \u201chuge\u201d moment but has no advice. Instead, he confirms that Dr. Glassman has already made up his mind, referring to a first wife, thus implying a second one. When Debbie comes to the clinic to find her fianc\u00e9 \u201cleaping\u201d on the trampoline, he asks her to take another leap to the courthouse. This time, the pair is all dressed up for the occasion, along with Shaun and Carly serving as best man and bridesmaid. As Debbie and Aaron kiss, Shaun reaches for Carly\u2019s hand, in their own gentle hold.\n\nThe ending touch was quite a contrast to the initial effort made by Shaun after Carly's eloquent appeal for her need of hand-holding, insisting that it speaks of \u201cholding each other up as long as we can\u201d when life gets cold and dark. The experience was like a vise grip for Shaun, and Carly relents. Dr. Park assured Shaun that this gesture was one \u201clittle thing\u201d that would mean big problems for their relationship.\n\nA sacred song with sea lions\n\nClaire and Morgan (Fiona Gubelmann) are confronted with a patient with another kind of pain issue. Lily Barstow (Jennifer Lafleur) has a ruptured appendix and doesn't really feel any hint of pain. When the residents try to test her pain receptors, they discover that she senses physical pain as the only touch, never as a marker for anything more severe. There is another parallel here with Claire Brown, who stuffed so much of her emotional distress with her mother into her professional pursuit. Lily Barstow also endured the loss of her mother as a child, and the experience made all forms of pain dull to her.\n\nDuring surgery to remove an infection from her hand, the team is forced to amputate the hand to preserve Lily\u2019s life. During the explanation of her condition, and how she needs to monitor her body henceforth, Lily\u2019s husband (Mark Hildreth), becomes disenchanted and dumbfounded. He realizes that his wife has never experienced the love or the losses in their lives in the way that he has. He walks out, and that provokes distress in Lily. The husband eventually returns, deciding that he will be her monitor for pain instead of utilizing medication. Lily\u2019s first genuine tears of joy flow as she embraces him, and once more, \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d teaches about deeper dimensions of love.\n\nMeanwhile, Morgan is psychoanalyzing Claire all day long about her mother, and Claire rightly nails that Morgan is seeking \u201ca toy to break\u201d in her attitude. When Morgan discovers that a canister in the back of Claire\u2019s car contains the ashes of her mother, Claire relates the full story and her conundrum of how to move forward. In one of those rare \u201conly Morgan\u201d acts of friendship, Dr. Reznick insists that Claire fulfill her mother's final wish to \u201cbe\u201d with the sea lions at the marine life center. It just so happens that a gay pride sea life fashion show is running that evening. \u201cWe'll have to dress up,\u201d Morgan assures, and she and Claire are glittered and feathered to the nines in this mission.\n\nClaire tells Morgan that her mother wasn't religious, to which Morgan retorts, \u201cEverybody's got a religion-- not everybody has a God-- but everybody has a religion.\u201d She then says that \u201cmusic\u201d was the religion of Breeze Brown. Claire offers a pure and genuine rendition of \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d as she pours out her mother's ashes into the sea lion tank. The following tender scene shows Morgan resting her head on Claire\u2019s shoulder, just before Claire leaves the subway. Thomas\u2019 performance is wrenching and tremendous.\n\nUnfortunately, Claire hasn't yet come to giving herself grace in the loss. She goes to a bar, drinks, and meets a stranger, allowing him to have \u201ca quickie\u201d in the alley as the episode closes. Anesthetic only works for a while, even on \u201cThe Good Doctor,\u201d and these choices will only make the real pain worse.\n\nThis deeply personal and impactful episode speaks to every human being on some level. Love, loss, and pain are part of every life journey, and the scenes speak beyond the dialogue.\n\nNext week, \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d brings Dr. Murphy's lead surgery, and the preview certainly indicates a diversion from the well-deliberated plan for the gifted resident.", "description": "Shaun and Carly explore nonverbal connection while Claire fulfills her mother\u2019s final wish.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Ramon Sanchez", "Jane Flowers", "Read More On The Same Topic Tresa Patterson", "Dylan Dreyer", "Of", "Today", "Drafts Son Calvin As Impromptu Sous Chef", "Hawaii Five-O", "Season Episode"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/15/os/b_1200x630/shaun-and-carly-dont-have-success-in-their-first-try-at-holding-hands-on-the-good-doctor-image-source-abc-youtube_2339857.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
