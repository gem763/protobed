Maybe I should\u2019ve bought more than a $10 value pack of Woolies thin sausages and 2 litres bottles of Fanta\u2026 Either way, we\u2019re burnin\u2019 up, baby.\n\nWhen \u2018Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head\u2019 \u2013 debut single from Fever, Kylie\u2019s eighth studio album \u2013 spawned into the world 8th September 2001, it forged a new path\u2026 a horny, space-age, disco path. It spent 3 months atop the ARIA charts and reached number one in 40 countries.\n\nAt the age of 6, I was entranced.\n\nIf Kylie was a drug of choice, consider me under the influence. Watching Saturday morning Rage, I, too, wanted a bath sheet with slits for legs and a plunging neckline. I, too, wanted to be surrounded by a sea of robot men wrapped in red cellophane. I, too, wanted to boogie on a CBD rooftop adorned in my finest disco ball mini-dress.\n\nThank you, \u2018Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head\u2019, for being a tune that I could always rely on \u2013 the mere intro to the track sent even the most basic of my childhood parties into a UDL-flying, Lynx Africa-smelling mosh-pit (the best kind of mosh-pit).\n\nThank you, \u2018Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head\u2019, for being way ahead of your time in the fashion department. Thank you for being at least partly responsible for turning me into the thriving homosexual I am today.\n\nSo it\u2019s time to raise a toast to one of the most iconic tunes of our generation, which is now old enough to get a Prosecco at the RSL.\n\nBut seriously, I expect you all to hulk-smash the play button right now, blast it at maximum level, get naked and roll around on the floor. It\u2019s what Jesus would want.\n\nMerry Kylie-mas, kweens.", "description": "Kylie Minogue's highest-selling single, 'Can't Get You Out of My Head', is 18 today so it's time to get your glam rags on, kid.", "authors": ["Louis Hanson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/kylie18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
