The officer had been with the department since April 2018 and has now been placed on administrative leave.\n\nLt. Brandon O\u2019Neil, a department spokesman, said at a news conference that the department was continuing to investigate the shooting, and would look at why the officer did not identify himself as a police officer. The officer is scheduled to be interviewed by the department\u2019s major case unit on Monday.\n\nOfficers tried to provide medical care, but Ms. Jefferson was pronounced dead by 3:05 a.m., according to the Tarrant County medical examiner. Police said they had found a gun in the room \u2014 not the one the officer used \u2014 but have declined to answer further questions.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement has not said that she wielded a weapon,\u201d Mr. Merritt said, adding that she owned a gun legally. \u201cAlso, it wouldn\u2019t matter, because that\u2019s her home.\u201d\n\nKelly Allen Gray, a city councilwoman who represents the neighborhood where Ms. Jefferson was killed, said it did not make sense that a neighbor\u2019s concern could lead to a woman\u2019s death.", "description": "A police officer fired the shot that killed Atatiana Jefferson from outside her bedroom window.
