But He Didn\u2019t Step Up To Oppose An NRA Champion.", "language": "en", "text": "Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Democratic congressman from El Paso, Texas, is hoping a push for tougher gun laws can lift the fortunes of his struggling presidential campaign.\n\nIn the wake of the mass shooting in an El Paso Walmart that killed 22 people, he has backed more ambitious gun safety policies than any of his rivals, particularly his call for a mandatory buyback program for military-style assault rifles already in circulation.\n\nBut this new ardor on gun regulation hits a still-raw nerve for some of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s critics, who recall his neutrality in a key House race in 2018 that returned a National Rifle Association-approved lawmaker to Congress.\n\nAt the time, O\u2019Rourke was engaged in his own high-profile, grassroots-approved run for the Senate against incumbent Ted Cruz (R-Texas).\n\nThe race to represent Texas\u2019 23rd Congressional District pitted Gina Ortiz Jones, a Democrat backed by the Giffords gun safety group, against Rep. Will Hurd, a Republican who had an \u201cA\u201d rating from the NRA. O\u2019Rourke declined to endorse Ortiz Jones, a lesbian Iraq War veteran who would have been the first Filipina-American in Congress. She went on to lose the race to Hurd, who is friends with O\u2019Rourke, by a mere 926 votes.\n\nAlthough it is impossible to know for sure what O\u2019Rourke\u2019s endorsement would have done for Ortiz Jones, he racked up bigger vote totals than she did in a number of the 23rd District\u2019s rural counties that November, which suggests his blessing could have made a difference. The district covers 26 counties and parts of three more. A HuffPost analysis of election results found that if Ortiz Jones had attained O\u2019Rourke\u2019s totals in these seven counties \u2015 Culberson, Brewster, Val Verde, Maverick, Zavala, Dimmit and Presidio \u2015 she would have netted an additional 970 votes, more than Hurd\u2019s margin of victory.\n\n\u201cI am glad that Beto is coming to this [guns] fight when so many have been organizing and making policy on it for so long,\u201d said Annie Weinberg, a former elections director for the liberal group Democracy for America, which endorsed both O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate bid and Ortiz Jones\u2019 House run. \u201cIt remains to be seen the depth of his commitment and how he is going to follow through, because he was willing to give a pass to a congressman who had an A rating from the NRA. That is a trust deficit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Beto had a chance to help elect a pro-gun control Democrat over the NRA favorite, he stayed on the sidelines,\u201d said Monica Klein, who advises progressive women running for office. \u201cHis newfound gun control activism is the kind of inauthentic posturing that turns voters off of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nBeto O'Rourke has endorsed a mandatory assault weapons buyback, among other tough gun safety provisions.

In March 2017, after a Washington snowstorm scuttled air travel plans, the neighboring House members embarked on a buddy road trip from San Antonio, Texas, back to the nation\u2019s capital in time for important votes. The pair, who earned some viral attention with a live stream of their trip, appeared together at an official event more than a year later, at a time when O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate run and Hurd\u2019s reelection bid were in full swing.\n\n\u201cWhen it came to his congressional career, Beto was never about the issues. Beto has always been about protecting his buddies in Congress,\u201d said progressive strategist Murshed Zaheed, noting that O\u2019Rourke endorsed Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney for New York attorney general in 2018 over both progressive law professor Zephyr Teachout and Tish James, who became the state\u2019s first Black attorney general.", "description": "O\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t endorse Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones in her 2018 race against GOP Rep.
