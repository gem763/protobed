Silver has urged players to speak out on issues of concern, including questions of police brutality and gun violence.\n\nBut Silver told Kyodo News in an interview the league\u2019s stance was firm that members of the NBA community were free to express themselves and that the league backed their right to do so.\n\n\u201cThere are the values that have been part of this league from its earliest days, and that includes free expression,\u201d Silver, in Japan for a preseason game on Tuesday between the Rockets and the Toronto Raptors, told Kyodo.\n\n\u201cI think as a values-based organisation that I want to make it clear ... that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression,\u201d he told the news agency. \u201cI accept that it is also Chinese governments\u2019 and Chinese businesses\u2019 right to react to those words and, at least from my long-time experience in the NBA, it will take some time to heal some of these issues.\u201d\n\nSilver said the league also supported Brooklyn Nets owner and Alibaba Group co-founder Joseph Tsai, who issued a lengthy statement criticising Morey\u2019s tweet.", "description": "NBA commissioner Adam Silver defended the league's response to the Houston Rockets general manager's tweet backing Hong Kong democracy protests, telling Japan's Kyodo News that his organisation supports freedom of expression without necessarily endorsing a point of view.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438298195&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9706X", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
