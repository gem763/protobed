But for all of his lunacy, one thing Giuliani hasn\u2019t yet done is suggest that Trump is a king and that Democrats are trying to murder him.\n\nOn Tuesday\u2019s episode of Fox News\u2019 The Ingraham Angle, Joseph diGenova did what Giuliani hasn\u2019t. The lawyer and ardent Trump fan appeared on the show right next to Giuliani, when he called the impeachment proceedings against Trump \u201cregicide.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is regicide,\u201d said diGenova, who was under consideration for a role on Trump\u2019s legal team last year. \u201cThis is regicide by another name, fake impeachment.\u201d He bashed \u201cdespicable\u201d Democrats, then called the whistle-blowers who have spoken out against Trump \u201csuicide bombers that the Democrats have unleashed on the Democratic process.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that this first suicide bomber who sent that complaint to the inspector general was a paid Democratic operative of the Democratic Party,\u201d diGenova added, showing off the type of conspiratorial thinking that\u2019s endeared him so much to Trump in recent years.\n\nIngraham let diGenova\u2019s invocation of \u201cregicide\u201d pass without remark, even though Trump is not a king and no one is trying to kill him. But she did clarify his \u201csuicide bomber\u201d smear.\n\n\u201cYou mean political suicide bomber, obviously,\u201d Ingraham said, urging anyone who takes diGenova literally to \u201cget a sense of humor.\u201d Giuliani, sitting a few feet away, could not contain his laughter.", "description": "Trump superfan Joe diGenova called the whistle-blowers \u201csuicide bombers\u201d and accused Democrats of \u201cregicide.\u201d", "authors": ["Adam K.
