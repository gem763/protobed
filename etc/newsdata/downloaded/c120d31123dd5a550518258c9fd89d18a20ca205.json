Upfront pricing for the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro costs $149 and $199, respectively.\n\nBut on the online store, consumers are also offered the choice to \"pay monthly until canceled\" for $3.99 per month and $7.99, respectively. Similar options are available for the iPad and Apple Watch.\n\nThe option to pay monthly for the previously available fixed two- or three-year periods has also gone. So consumers either pay upfront for two years' coverage, or pay a monthly subscription-like fee for indefinite AppleCare+ coverage.\n\nThe changes to term and renewal come as replacement cycles slow for all smartphones, with consumers often keeping devices for more than three years.\n\nWhile consumers will pay more over 24 months for AppleCare+ on a monthly basis, this new option could be a sweetener for consumers who decide to keep their phones beyond two or three years.\n\nThe key section of the updated legal document highlights that the plan will continue \"unless canceled\" or in the event that Apple no longer has service parts. In the latter event, Apple will provide 30 days notice.\n\n\"For Monthly Plans, your Plan Term is one (1) month. Your Plan will automatically renew each month unless cancelled as set forth in the \"Cancellation\" Section 9 below, including in the event that Apple is no longer able to service your Covered Equipment due to the unavailability of service parts, in which case Apple will provide you with thirty (30) days' prior written notice of cancellation, or as otherwise required by law,\" Apple states.\n\nApple also made another significant change to AppleCare+ services for 'Accidental Damage from Handling' or 'ADH Service'.\n\nIt previously had a lower price for the first 'service event' within the two- or three-year period and then charged $10 or $20 more for the second service event, depending on the device.\n\nIn the case of the Apple Watch, the first and second events previously cost $69 and $89, respectively, while screen-only damage on the iPhone previously cost $29 and $39, respectively.\n\nSEE MORE: iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max: Everything Apple unveiled and what it means\n\nIn the updated legal document, there is only price \u2013 equivalent to the previous first service event \u2013 for each service event. And there is no longer a limit of two service events on monthly AppleCare+ plans, with the exception of Apple Watch Edition and Herm\u00e8s, which are restricted to two service events within a two- or three-year period. Single-pay plans are still limited to two service events.\n\nThe new document states: \"Further, services for ADH expire and all of Apple's obligations to you under this section are fulfilled in their entirety once Apple has provided to you: (i) for Single-Pay Plans, two (2) Service Events; or (ii) for Monthly Plans, two (2) Service Events within a twenty-four (24)-month period (or thirty-six (36)-month period for Apple Watch Edition or Herm\u00e8s) based on your Plan's original purchase date as specified on the original sales receipt.\"\n\nThe former document stated: \"Further, services for ADH expire and all of Apple's obligations to you under this section are fulfilled in their entirety once Apple has provided to you two (2) Service Events.\"", "description": "Apple also reduces the price of second-event damages to devices including iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/12/050fe08b-722f-40c4-ac74-b4e89ff91630/thumbnail/770x578/caedba4a9a74de1d194fb59ec6d5e141/apple-event-091019-iphone-11-90161.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
