Happy times.\n\n\"They\u2019re memories that I have to keep about Julie. There\u2019s only a handful of photos of me and Julie together. We grew up together in the centre of Durham.\n\n\"We argued like brother and sister do all the time. I was always there for her if she was ever upset or anything like that.\n\n\"Julie was lovely. She got on with everybody. She was well-known in Durham and was friendly with everybody.\"\n\nBut the 31-year-old desperately wanted to be loved and craved stability.\n\nJulie was in a happy relationship with Alan Taylor, with who she had a child.\n\nHowever, she battled depression and would occasionally vanish for a few days at a time, always returning home to her family.\n\nSo when she failed to return home one night in 1998, Alan wasn't worried.\n\n(Image: North News & Pictures Newcastle)\n\nThen her absence went on for longer than usual and when she missed an appointment with one of her daughters, her worried partner reported her missing to police.\n\nHer disappearance coincided with a far more chilling discovery - a human torso had been found in the search for another missing person.\n\nFormer Darlington police officer, David Davies, was the man who made the grim find.\n\nHe had released his police dog, Tyler, who caught a scent and started to bark.\n\nDavid told Crime+Investigation's Murdertown: \"I tasked the dog with searching this area for anything bearing human scent.\n\n\"His head went up in the air and he started to sample the air, or sniff the air.\n\n\"He them jumped up, put his paws up on the wall, started to run to and fro, like he was playing a piano, and then he started to bark; the bark being the indication that he had found something bearing human scent.\n\n\"I\u2019ve gone across to where he was, looked through the fence, or the hedge, and seen what looked like a derelict house, a derelict bungalow.\n\n\"My initial reaction was that he\u2019s probably found a homeless person.\n\n\"I called out to see if there was anybody there, no reply, put my arm through the hedge, felt what I now realise was a binbag, pulled at it, which caused it to split open a little bit, and of course that released the smell of decomposing flesh.\"\n\nThe house wasn't derelict and the woman living there told the officer that some \"lads\" had thrown the bag over her wall a few weeks earlier.\n\nShe insisted the group had told her it was a dead dog and that she'd thought nothing more of it.\n\nPolice quickly realised they had found one of Julie's body parts and told her devastated family she had been killed.\n\nBut when police discovered to horrifying reality of what had happened to the troubled young mum, it would rock her home town of Darlington in the North East for decades.\n\nJulie was on a night out when she met David Harker.\n\nDespite having a criminal record, Harker had made a good impression on his neighbours and was popular with women.\n\nAfter a few drinks in the pub, Harker persuaded Julie to come back to his flat and the pair had sex.\n\nHarker then strangled the mother and had sex with her corpse before cutting off flesh from her thigh.\n\nHarker then made a gruesome meal of Julie's cooked thigh, pasta, garlic and cheese and ate it before dragging her body down to the basement of his block of flats.\n\nHe kept his victim in the basement for several weeks while he chopped off her arms, legs and head before dumping her torso in a bin big in what he thought was a derelict garden.\n\nIt was Harker himself who let slip what he had done to the tragic mum, who was the same age as her own mother when she was killed.\n\nHe boasted to friends that \"I've killed a girl called Julie\", who alerted police and he became their number one suspect.\n\nWhen officers searched Harker's flat they found horrific evidence that proved he was responsible for what had happened to Julie.\n\nOne forensic officer even said it looked like a scene from Silence of the Lambs, with surfaces covered in blood - but no sign of the rest of the body parts.\n\nHarker was arrested but when it came to trial his charges were reduced to manslaughter on the grounds of diminshed responsibility rather than murder.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe was jailed, but the search for Julie's remaining body parts continued as all that had been recovered was her torso.\n\nForensic officers scoured woodland, parks and even Darlington's sewers to find the rest of the remains - but nothing was recovered.\n\nThe ordeal of not knowing what had happened to his girlfriend's remains was taking its toll on Alan Taylor.\n\nHe would visit her grave every Sunday and became increasingly fearful that Harker would one day be released.\n\nThen, in 2005, Alan came up with a troubled plan that he believed would finally solve the mystery and punish Harker.\n\nPolice were called to a home and found the body of John Harrison.\n\nHe had been strangled to death and the man responsible was Alan Taylor, who was one of his friends.\n\nJulie's brother, Michael, said: \"He believed when he would go to jail, that he could get at David Harker and obviously that wasn\u2019t going to happen.\"\n\nTaylor believed that justice had not been served for his girlfriend and wanted to take matters into his own hands.\n\nThe authorities saw straight through his plan and made sure he was never in the same prison as Harker.\n\nJust three months into his prison sentence, Taylor was found hanged in his cell.\n\nJulie's brother Michael said: \"I hope he's up there with Julie.\"\n\nHarker, who has now been in prison for more than 20 years, has never revealed the location of the rest of Julie's body.\n\nMichael said: \"If he was to tell us where Julie\u2019s head was, I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with him getting parole.\n\n\"But he wouldn\u2019t, I know he wouldn\u2019t say nothing. I know he won\u2019t. He enjoys all of this. He does.\n\n\"He hasn\u2019t just ruined my life, he ruined me family\u2019s life and two other family\u2019s lives. So there\u2019s a lot of people being affected.\"", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Mum-of-four Julie Paterson was butchered by David Harker in Darlington, who dumped her torso but has never revealed where he left the rest of her body", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "North News", "Pictures Newcastle", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20577915.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-David-Harker.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
