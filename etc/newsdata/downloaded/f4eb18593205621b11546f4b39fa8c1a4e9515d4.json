And some C-sections are performed electively, at maternal request.\n\nThis complexity regarding C-section decision making is not, in and of itself, a problem. If a doctor and a patient have a nuanced, fully informed discussion about the right mode of delivery, given the risks and benefits, they may reasonably arrive at the conclusion that a C-section is the right approach, even if it is not strictly required. The trouble is, that ideal of a doctor and a patient making an objective and informed decision together is hard to come by.\n\nDoctors and patients are not the only people involved in the decision, and they certainly don\u2019t make it in a vacuum. Most births in the U.S. occur in hospitals. By their very nature, hospitals introduce pressures that may alter birth choices. Labor rooms are scarce, and patients (and their doctors) may be subject to implicit or explicit pressure to avoid \u201ctaking too long.\u201d\n\nHospitals also tend to be risk-averse; many have developed systems that are intended to improve patient safety, but may result in pressure to perform C-sections rather than letting labor continue. If there is any doubt that the culture of individual hospitals can have an effect on a patient\u2019s chance of a C-section, one need only observe that hospitals\u2019 C-section rates vary from 7 percent to 70 percent. Differences in patient complexity cannot account for that spread.\n\nBut even setting aside risk aversion, the decision to perform a C-section can be clouded by considerations other than medical necessity. For example, physician-patients are about 10 percent less likely to have a C-section than comparable nonphysician patients. Why this is the case is not clear, but it suggests that doctors may treat some patients differently from others. Studies have also found that C-sections\u2014especially first-time C-sections\u2014spike around morning, lunchtime, and the end of the day, which could be (could be) interpreted as induced demand by doctors who are responding to scheduling pressures: getting to office hours, eating lunch, going home.\n\nYet another possible reason for the country\u2019s high C-section rate, as we mentioned, is that physicians are routinely paid more for a C-section than they are for a vaginal delivery\u2014on average, about 15 percent more. Why is this the case? The prevailing logic is that a C-section is a major surgery, so the physicians\u2019 payment should reflect the greater potential for complexity. But this logic rests on a crude generalization. Vaginal birth can be very straightforward, but it can also be very complicated and time-consuming. The same is true for a C-section. Despite this, payments are fixed\u2014they reflect the mode of delivery, not the difficulty.", "description": "A doctor and an economist note that doctors are generally paid quite a bit more for a C-section than for a vaginal birth.", "authors": ["Emily Oster", "W.
