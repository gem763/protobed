Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) saw a massive fundraising surge in the last three months, lending further credence to her status as a frontrunner among a large 2020 presidential field.\n\nIn an email shared with supporters on Monday afternoon, Warren's campaign manager Roger Lau said that in the second quarter of the year, the Massachusetts Democrat raised more than $19.1 million from more than 384,000 people making more than 683,000 donations. The average contribution was $28 and, according to the campaign, more than 80 percent of second-quarter donors were first-time givers. The campaign said they now have $19.7 million cash on-hand.\n\nThat haul represents an enormous increase from Warren\u2019s first-quarter fundraising\u2014which, early on, raised doubts about whether her policy-centric campaign would resonate with voters. In the first quarter, Warren\u2019s campaign said she raised more than $6 million, somewhat quieting those early concerns, especially as more than $1.4 million of that came in during the last week of the quarter.\n\nAlthough, simultaneously, the campaign spent $5.2 million, in part on building up a large staffing operation in the early voting states. That hasn\u2019t tapered off at all as Warren\u2019s operation boasts over 300 staffers with 60 percent working in the four early-voting states.\n\nDuring the second quarter, the Warren campaign had several big moments that seemingly contributed to both her polling and fundraising upswings: The senator called for impeachment early on, following Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report; introduced her student debt cancellation plan; and publicly turned down a Fox News town hall as other Democrats chose to participate on the network.\n\nThe senator\u2019s haul was accomplished after swearing off high-dollar fundraisers, a move her campaign has said allows her to focus on policy rollouts and near-constant grassroots events throughout the country.\n\nWarren\u2019s second-quarter tally puts her behind former Vice President Joe Biden, who recently announced raising $21.5 million since his late April launch, and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who announced raising $24.8 million\u2014the largest of the field so far.\n\nBut Warren\u2019s second-quarter numbers beat out both Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), another competitor who has rejected high-dollar fundraisers, and Kamala Harris (D-CA), whose performance in the first Democratic debate has helped propel her poll numbers upward.\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign recently said that she brought in nearly $12 million during the second quarter, with more than $2 million coming in the 24 hours after her strong debate performance. Warren's campaign did not share the amount of her total she earned following her debate performance on the first night of the back-to-back event.\n\nSanders raised $18 million in the last three months from nearly one million individual contributions.\n\nSeeming to acknowledge that Warren narrowly beat Sanders in her fundraising total, Lau wrote in the email: \u201cTo sum it up: We raised more money than any other 100% grassroots-funded campaign. That\u2019s big. You sent a message that Elizabeth\u2019s vision for the future is worth fighting for. And you showed the rich and powerful that change is coming \u2014 sooner than they think.\u201d", "description": "Warren is now considered among the race\u2019s frontrunners and her raising $19 million over the last three months seems to confirm as much.", "authors": ["Gideon Resnick", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1434,w_2550,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1562601136/warren_fundraising_quarter_2_s899a5", "published_at": "2019-07-08"}
