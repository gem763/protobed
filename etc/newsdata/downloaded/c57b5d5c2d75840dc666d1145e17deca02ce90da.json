REUTERS/Oleksandr Klymenko\n\nWhile the exchange of 35 prisoners on each side could help rebuild confidence between Moscow and Kiev and allow them to start negotiating seriously on other issues, any road to a full rapprochement is likely to be long and complex.\n\nAfter lengthy negotiations, expectations have been running high for the prisoner swap, which had been described as imminent by the leaders of both countries in recent days.\n\nOn Saturday a Russian aircraft carrying freed Russian prisoners from Kiev landed in Moscow while a Ukrainian plane with released Ukrainian prisoners aboard touched down in Kiev.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hugged and shook hands with the freed Ukrainians while Russia\u2019s Rossiya 24 TV showed Russian prisoners disembarking the plane in Moscow.\n\nZelenskiy told reporters at the Kiev airport that the swap was part of his deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHe said all steps had to be taken \u201cto finish this horrible war,\u201d referring to the five-year-old conflict with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe swap was carried out on a \u201c35-to-35\u201d basis, Interfax news agency quoted Russian human rights commissioner Tatyana Moskalkova as saying. \u201cUkraine has handed out 35 people to Russia, we handed out the same number to Ukraine,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe view the agreed mutual release of persons held in Russia and Ukraine as a positive signal that should be followed by other important steps to break the impasse in the current situation in Russia-Ukraine relations,\u201d the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\nLINGERING SEPARATIST CONFLICT\n\nThough Ukraine\u2019s demands for the return of Crimea have fallen on deaf ears in Russia, Saturday\u2019s exchange is seen in some quarters as a win for Zelenskiy, who swept to power this year promising to repatriate compatriots held in Russia.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kiev congratulated Zelenskiy on bringing home the Ukrainian citizens and called on Russia to release \u201cthe many other Ukrainians who remain unjustly in Russian custody,\u201d it said in a social media post.\n\nRussian-backed separatists continue to control a swathe of Ukraine\u2019s east in a conflict that has killed more than 13,000 people. Zelenskiy has pledged to end the regular, low-level clashes that persist despite a ceasefire signed in 2015.\n\nThe swap could set the stage for serious talks, even though major differences remain between the two countries. French President Emmanuel Macron has been pushing for a summit to discuss the issue with Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France.\n\nPutin said on Thursday the exchange would be \u201ca good step forward toward the normalization (of relations)\u201d with Russia\u2019s fellow former Soviet republic, adding he expected large numbers of prisoners to be involved.\n\nAmong the Ukrainians freed on Saturday were 24 sailors detained by Russia during a clash in waters off Crimea last year. Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, jailed in Russia, was also in the group.\n\nAmong prisoners handed over to Moscow was Volodymyr Tsemakh, suspected of involvement in the downing of a Malaysia Airlines flight over rebel-held eastern Ukraine in 2014 that killed all 298 aboard.\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\nThe airliner was on a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, and the Dutch government issued a statement saying it \u201cseriously regrets that under pressure from the Russian Federation Mr Tsemakh was included in this prisoner swap\u201d.\n\nDutch prosecutors did get a chance to question Tsemakh before his release, it added. Ukraine\u2019s security service has identified Tsemakh as a former commander of Russian-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine.\n\nOne of the 35 freed Russians brought a black-and-white cat with him on the flight back to Moscow, released Russian journalist Kirill Vyshinsky told RIA news agency. \u201cIt is a year and three months old, it is called Mashka,\u201d he said.", "description": "Russia and Ukraine carried out a long-awaited prisoner swap on Saturday in a step that could thaw a deep freeze in relations since Moscow's annexation of the Crimea region in 2014.", "authors": ["Anton Zverev", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427263392&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF860JG", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
