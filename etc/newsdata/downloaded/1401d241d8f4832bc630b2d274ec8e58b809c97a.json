When Bungaree died in 1830 he was the best-known Aborigine in the New South Wales colony\n\nMost of those illustrations show Bungaree dressed in discarded military uniforms given to him by governors and other important citizens.\n\nBorn about 1775 among the Garigal people, Bungaree was described in the Australian Dictionary of Biography in 1966 as of 'happy disposition and much intelligence.'\n\nHe was also recorded as Boongarie, Bongaree, Bongary, Bonjary and Boungaree and moved to the Port Jackson settlement in the 1790s with the remnants of an indigenous clan from Broken Bay, north of Sydney.\n\nBungaree was a talented mimic, being able to imitate the walk, talk and other mannerisms of each of the governors he knew.\n\nBungaree was so well-known that at least 18 portraits and other illustrations were made during his lifetime, whereas there are just two or three of his friend Governor Lachlan Macquarie\n\nHe used his skills in street performances to cadge rum, tea, tobacco, bread and sugar for himself and his people.\n\n'He spoke English well and was noted for his acute sense of humour,' according to the Australian Dictionary of Biography.\n\n'Although he had no tribal authority his adaptation to the life of the settlement, his talent for entertaining and his high standing with governors and officials established him as the leader of the township Aborigines.'\n\n'It seems likely that Bungaree's facile exhibitionism too easily impressed his white contemporaries, who quite failed to understand the Aborigines.'\n\nThe late author and historian Geoffrey Dutton put it this way: 'He mocked the white men by mocking himself.'\n\nBungaree was described later in life as a beggar and drunkard but deserves to be remembered as a diplomat and seafarer.\n\nHis voyages with the celebrated Flinders make him a significant figure in Australian maritime exploration.\n\nFlinders arrived in Sydney in 1795 on board HMS Reliance with surgeon George Bass and the indigenous leader Bennelong, who was returning from England having been presented to the king.\n\nA bust of Bungaree is displayed at the entrance to Mosman Civic Centre, which houses Mosman Council and Chambers\n\nHistorians think it likely that during that voyage Flinders discussed with Bennelong the worth of taking an indigenous person on his planned explorations.\n\nBungaree and another Aborigine called Nanbarry sailed with Flinders to Norfolk Island in May 1798 on Reliance and during that 60-day round trip impressed the young English naval lieutenant.\n\nThe following year he sailed with Flinders and Nanbarry on the longboat Norfolk for a coastal survey of Moreton Bay and Hervey Bay in what is now Queensland.\n\nFlinders relied on Bungaree's knowledge of Aboriginal protocol and used him as a go-between with Aborigines the party encountered during the six-week voyage.\n\nBungaree also took part in the establishment of the penal settlement on the Hunter River at what is now Newcastle in 1801.\n\nHis greatest maritime adventure began in 1802 when he set out with Flinders, Bass and their crew in the sloop HMS Investigator to circumnavigate and map the continent. That voyage also included a trip to Timor.\n\nThroughout these journeys Bungaree helped Flinders negotiate peaceful passage among coastal Aborigines, despite not speaking their languages.\n\nUsing improvised dialogue and hand gestures he communicated the explorers' intentions and showed crew members which plants were safe to eat.\n\nFlinders late wrote that Bungaree was particularly kind to his cat Trim.\n\nIn A Voyage to Terra Australis published in 1814, Flinders wrote that Bungaree's 'good disposition and open and manly conduct had attracted my esteem.'\n\nBungaree was a talented mimic, being able to imitate the walk, talk and other mannerisms of each of the governors he knew. He used his skills in street performances to cadge rum, tea, tobacco, bread and sugar for himself and his people. His death in 1830 was widely noted\n\nIn 1815 Governor Macquarie set up 16 members of Bungaree's clan on a farm at George's Head on the north shore of the harbour near what is now Mosman.\n\nThe group was given two huts, stock, seed, a boat and farming implements on a 6 hectare lot. Bungaree, who was an expert spear fisherman, planted peaches.\n\nIn 1817 he set sail again - this time to north-western Australia and Timor in the cutter Mermaid under Phillip Parker King once more acting as a guide and interpreter.\n\n'He was about forty-five years of age, of a sharp, intelligent and unassuming disposition, and promised to be of much service to us in our intercourse with the natives,' King wrote of him.\n\nMacquarie had begun to use the term 'Australia' after reading Flinders's Terra Australis and on May 26, 1818 botanist Allan Cunningham referred to Bungaree as an 'Australian' in his journal.\n\n'During the whole of this day's excursion I was accompanied by our worthy native chief, Bongaree, of whose little attentions to me and others when on these excursions I have been perhaps too remiss in making mention, to the enhancement of the character of this enterprising Australian,' he wrote.\n\nWhile his feats of exploration earnt Bungaree's place in navigational history, back in Sydney he became part of town folklore.\n\nWhen any ship dropped anchor in Port Jackson Bungaree would greet the vessel in a fishing boat rowed by his wives, ready to collect 'tribute' he claimed was owed to him.\n\nDressed in a ragged military dress jacket with brass buttons, and in bare feet, he topped the look with a black cocked hat featuring gold ribbons and feather plume.\n\nIn 1828 Bungaree and his clan moved their camp to the Domain, where he was seen naked and 'in the last stages of human infirmity'.\n\nBungaree died on November 24, 1830 after a long illness and the news reported three days later on page 2 of The Sydney Gazette.\n\n'We have to announce the death of his Aboriginal Majesty King BOONGARIE, Supreme Chief of the Sydney tribe,' the newspaper said.\n\n'He expired on Wednesday last, at Garden Island, after a lingering sickness of several months. A coffin has been despatched thither from the Lumber Yard, and he will be interred at Rose Bay, beside the remains of his late Queen, this day.'", "description": "The remains of Captain Matthew Flinders, who led the first circumnavigation of Australia, were discovered by experts excavating St James's burial ground, Euston, London (pictured).", "authors": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/00/19814098-0-image-a-32_1571269503124.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
