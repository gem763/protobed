But I would sure walk across the aisle, shake their hands and stand shoulder to shoulder with them through what is going to come. They have the guts to stand up for what they believe to be the best interests of the country. Decent human beings and worthy opponents in the process of dialogue that lies at the heart of our democratic system. hughfromalice\n\n\u2018Corbyn gave one of his best Commons performances today\u2019\n\n\u2018Corbyn gave one of his best Commons performances today (thought on his feet, had solid attack lines) \u2013 just as Johnson gave his worst since becoming PM. A reminder that if there is a snap election, it won\u2019t be plain sailing for the Conservatives.\u2019 Labertha Trickle\n\n\u2018There are plenty of Conservatives who are still conservative and they\u2019re not going to like the way Boris is behaving\u2019\n\n\u2018Johnson thinks his party can simply ditch the likes of Benyon, Hammond, Letwin, Vaizey, Stewart, Soames, Gyimah etc without suffering any electoral consequences \u2013 I reckon he\u2019s in for a nasty surprise if he manages to force an election. Plenty of Southern Tory constituencies are ripe for a swing to the Lib Dems and he\u2019s going to lose plenty of seats in Scotland. He\u2019s a dangerous, reckless fool \u2013 there are plenty of Conservatives who are still \u2013 well \u2013 conservative and they\u2019re not going to like the way he\u2019s behaving.\u2019 Abobrinha\n\n\u2018Remain Tory voters are now looking at the risk of a Corbyn premiership which will split some of the remain\u2019\n\n\u2018Corbyn is positioned as remain by siding with the remain voters so the Labour leave voters will go to the Brexit party. Boris now looks like he has his hand forced to be able to deliver any Brexit, so Nigel backs Boris and the manifesto says repeal the Benn amendment which has a delivery date of 19 October which is after the election. Maybe he wins the election, maybe he doesn\u2019t but if he had to go to the polls, there aren\u2019t any more metrics he\u2019d want in his favour. Remain Tory voters are now looking at the risk of a Corbyn premiership which will split some of the remain, while leave is possibly united as long as the Brexit party vote is behind Boris.\u2019 trazer985\n\n\u2018They don\u2019t seem to have any political nous whatsoever\u2019\n\n@UKLabour\u2069 for a deal have decided to try and revive Theresa May\u2019s thrice-rejected deal\n\n\u2018What is it with these people? They don\u2019t seem to have any political nous whatsoever. Jeremy Corbyn and his team have done a fantastic job in very difficult circumstances to hold the Conservatives to account and bring about a situation where we have a real chance to stop or mitigate Brexit. Then at this crucial time, they go off in their own direction without any thought for the party and what it is trying to achieve or how their cack-handed tactics could undermine Labour\u2019s standing. Totally disrespectful of the party\u2019s leadership team, the members and the voters.\u2019 kaboios\n\n\u2018Another referendum is the answer\u2019\n\n\u2018We continually fail to address the elephant in the room ... more elections of MPs to decide whether or not we want Brexit is surely not the answer. Another referendum is the answer.\u2019 paulmarkj\n\n\u2018Our elected parliament has had three years to sort this out\u2019\n\n\u2018Our elected parliament has had three years to sort this out, both within the UK and with Europe, without managing to reach an agreement and now at the end of the line are thrashing about trying to save their bacon it seems. Disappointed to say the least. What do we pay MPs for, to deliver guaranteed (oh that suggests accountability) good results for all of us, a bit of a punt (it will be alright on the night) or snafu?\u2019 Paul Mott", "description": "You have been reacting to political events after Johnson suffers defeat in parliament", "authors": ["Guardian Readers"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0a56fdeb28baba24bb6e38d4ed9f5cd9286dca2/0_48_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3cf4fd87e0bc780981e6508cfa448b90"}
