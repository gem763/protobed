Both enigmatic France and dazzling Japan have the ability to upset the apple cart today, but it will have to be an almighty effort against Wales and South Africa sides that have been going well throughout the tournament thus far.\n\nJacques Brunel's men will be buoyed by the fact that, the last time Wales and France two sides faced each other in a World Cup, the 2011 semi-final, France came out as victors. That was a ragged France, too, don't forget, with off-field controversies and trauma dominating their campaign. That result means little today but France will take heart in the fact they were able to turn it on when it mattered regardless of a dodgy off-field atmosphere.\n\nBut Wales have forgotten how to lose. They have lost just once all year - that pretty nugatory loss at Twickenham in the World Cup warm-ups - and got beyond the tough tests provided by Australia and Fiji in the pool stages. They are battle-hardened.\n\nThe winner of this one will fact the winner of Japan vs South Africa, to come later today at 11.15am BST. Wales now have as good a chance as any of making their first ever World Cup final. Should they overcome France today, while South Africa or Japan will be no pushover in the semi-finals, avoiding a potential clash with New Zealand until the final is priceless in a World Cup.", "description": "Michael Cheika has quit as Australia head coach after his team's resounding loss to England yesterday.", "authors": ["Charles Richardson", "Sir Ian Mcgeechan", "Ben Coles", "Maggie Alphonsi", "Daniel Schofield"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000213563928-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwT27dwT8Y2Pn13Ig-0qNVC8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
