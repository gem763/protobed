Still inside the cloud, considered consolidation still. Breaking above the cloud, Kumo Twist, and breaking the 200MA, I\u2019d consider this a complete trend shift from Bear to Bull. $XRP,\u201d he noted.\n\nOBV downtrend has been broken, Guppy flipping to green should be on the horizon.

Volume is coming into them. Would be exciting to see that dominance start to drop as folks get FOMO about the altcoin markets. $XRP $ADA $EOS $TRX,\u201d he explained while pointing to the charts of the multiple altcoins listed above.\n\n$BTC dominance is at 66% but starting to see the major alts break into their 1D clouds and breaking their downtrend OBVs.
