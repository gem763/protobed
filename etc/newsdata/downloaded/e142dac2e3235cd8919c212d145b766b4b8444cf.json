It\u2019s very flashy and obnoxiously free-to-play, but I\u2019m actually having a great time. It\u2019s a neat new way to interact with my favourite fighters.\n\nDeveloped by Netmarble, The King of Fighters Allstar casts players as a person with the ability to manifest as characters from throughout the fighting game series\u2019 25-year history, from The King of Fighters \u201894 on up to The King of Fighters XIV. A girl named Noah befriends the player, urging them to battle their way up The King of Fighters rankings in order to get to the bottom of their strange, martial-artist-manifesting abilities.\n\nAt least that\u2019s the story. The real reason players can become KOF characters is so they can collect them all via the game\u2019s gacha-style summoning system. Players spend \u201crubies\u201d earned through gameplay or obtained via in-app purchases in order to buy characters from the game\u2019s 200+ strong roster. Characters are arranged in teams of three, each with a backup character to be called in during fights for a little extra.\n\nInstead of fighting in one-on-one tag-team battles like the core King of Fighters games, teams in The King of Fighters Allstar engage in side-scrolling beat-em-up battles. A virtual joystick moves the fighters across the stage as generic enemies swarm. Characters use a combination of basic hits and kicks and their signature super moves from the fighting games to plow through the masses. At the end of each stage a boss appears. The boss goes down and it\u2019s on to the next, slightly more difficult battle.\n\nPlayers can swap between the three characters on their team as they please. There\u2019s an elemental affinity system in place where characters of one element are stronger or weaker against enemies of another, so having a varied selection of fighters available is important. Each main character in a team has a striker, a backup character who can drop into the game to deliver a quick attack when needed. Players can complete missions solo or team up with others in co-op mode, though I\u2019ve not had much luck finding open multiplayer rooms so far.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty basic battle system\u2014any system with an \u201cauto-battle\u201d option generally is\u2014but it\u2019s pleasant enough. I\u2019ve tried letting my characters fight on their own while working through the game\u2019s story missions, but the special attack, block, and dodge buttons call to me.\n\nBattles might be basic, but fighter management is anything but. Each character has a skill tree that unlocks new abilities and upgrades stats. While characters level up slowly by playing through story missions and special events, experience-point-boosting items are rewarded regularly to help power up players\u2019 favourites. Players can raise their affinity with each character through gift-giving, which increases the character\u2019s power while rewarding the player with in-game currency and items.\n\nAll of this time spent managing, upgrading and customising has made me incredibly fond of my characters. I\u2019ve invested quite heavily into my Shermie, for example. When I get experience-point-boosting items, I go straight to her upgrade page. When I get new cores, items used to unlock new skill tree slots, hers is the first I check. We\u2019re partners, Shermie and I.\n\nWhat I really love about The King of Fighters Allstar is the presentation. Every screen has some character from the series rendered in 2D, animated in the infinitely GIFfable style seen above. The 2D animated sprites also appear in the main story\u2019s visual-novel-style cutscenes. Every now and then the game mixes in a special scene with a slightly more animated style, like this:\n\nIt\u2019s a joy to look at. Well, unless you have a low tolerance for free-to-play flashiness. The King of Fighters Allstar loves its advertisements. The game opens with multiple splash screens announcing upcoming or ongoing events and in-game store sales. There are multiple daily login rewards. There\u2019s a lucky roulette event going on.\n\nThere are multiple ways to summon characters or combat cards (which I\u2019ve not unlocked yet) or upgrade items. There\u2019s even a special event where players can get free weekly summon tickets for being Amazon Prime members, the first I\u2019ve seen of that sort of cross-promotion in a mobile game.\n\nIf you\u2019re at all worried about your self-control when it comes to microtransactions, run from The King of Fighters Allstar. Though I\u2019ve gotten plenty of in-game currency by playing through the game, completing challenges, or through launch window promotions, the urge to collect more characters in order to build a fighting force of extraordinary magnitude is strong.\n\nOtherwise, I\u2019m having a wonderful time with this greedy little game. The King of Fighters series has so many exciting characters. It\u2019s nice to play with them outside of their element. If you\u2019re a fan of the series and don\u2019t mind a little free-to-play mobile tomfoolery, then you win.", "description": "Out now on iTunes and Google Play, The King of Fighters Allstar takes the expansive roster of fighters from SNK\u2019s long-running fighting game series and turns them into collectible characters in a side-scrolling beat-em-up action RPG.
