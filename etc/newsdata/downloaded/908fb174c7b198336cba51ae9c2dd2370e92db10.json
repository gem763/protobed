And they\u2019re bringing them together. Nice hot meal provided by Lunchbox Fund,\u201d said Harry.\n\nMany of the young people had been terrified of the sea before they joined the youth group, he said.\n\nBritain's Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex join surf mentors, as they visit Waves for Change, an NGO supporting local surf mentors to provide mental health services to vulnerable young people living in under resourced communities, at Monwabisi Beach, in Cape Town, South Africa September 24, 2019.

Abalone, known locally as \u201cperlemoen\u201d, is prized in Asia. Poachers often trade it for drugs, Dyason said.\n\nEvery year, poachers steal about 2,000 tonnes of abalone from South Africa, worth around $60 million, said Traffic, an organization monitoring global trade in animals and plants.\n\nPrince Harry, joined by two Royal Marines helping to train the unit, briefly went out on an inflatable dinghy but high winds prevented him from visiting Seal Island, an abalone poaching hotspot in False Bay.\n\nIn 1795, the British defeated the Dutch in a sea skirmish in False Bay known as the \u201cBattle of Muizenberg,\u201d allowing Britain to take over Cape Town, an important sea trading port.\n\nLater in the day, the Duke and Duchess will visit South Africa\u2019s oldest mosque, Auwul Mosque, in the former slave enclave of Bo-Kaap in Cape Town\u2019s city center.\n\nHarry, Queen Elizabeth\u2019s grandson and sixth in line to the throne, has been visiting southern Africa for two decades for holidays and conservation work.\n\nHe will travel alone on Thursday to Botswana, where he and Meghan holidayed shortly after they began dating in July 2016 and returned to in 2017 for a romantic getaway.\n\nSlideshow (22 Images)\n\nHarry then heads to Angola, visiting the landmine clearance project that featured in iconic photographs of his late mother, Princess Diana, during her campaign to ban landmines.\n\nHe ends the solo section of his tour in Malawi, where he will meet President Peter Mutharika.", "description": "Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan danced and chanted with a group of mental health mentors at Cape Town's Monwabisi beach on Tuesday, on the second day of their ten-day Africa tour.", "authors": ["Wendell Roelf", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433337981&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N146", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
