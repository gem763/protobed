Will this hold true for BTC too?\n\nAnalysis by Thomas Lee Confirms S&P Bull Market\n\nThis Monday, the Fundstrat co-founder tweeted out his analysis of the state of S&P 500. Despite weakening global growth, increasing uncertainty surrounding trade wars and backlash against big tech companies, the S&P 500 closed at a new all-time high.\n\nS&P 500 closed at a new all-time high and given the broad participation, seems decisive. \u2013 if markets follow path of 3 precedent \u2018markets to nowhere\u2019 this is good news for equity investors. \u2013 avg gain is 51% over next 2 years. Means 2019 looks like the start of new bull#BTD pic.twitter.com/fGcV7FP5gf \u2014 Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) October 28, 2019\n\nHe pointed to three past precedents whereby the S&P suddenly went on a tear on the back of previous lows, confirming:\n\nIf markets follow path of 3 precedent \u2018markets to nowhere\u2019 this is good news for equity investors.\n\nWhen asked by one of his followers if that would have \u201cany positive effect on BTC\u201d, he replied in no uncertain terms:\n\nYes. Bitcoin is ambidextrous anyways.\n\nBitcoin Has a Positive or Negative Correlation with Stocks?\n\nTom Lee holds somewhat of an unpopular opinion in the bitcoin community. On Friday, when BTC saw its highest intraday gain since 2011, he tweeted out that it performs best when S&P rallies:\n\n+12% rally in #Bitcoin coinciding with strong equity day as S&P 500 nearing all-time highs\u2026 \u2013 a reminder of the 'unpopular' opinion that the bitcoin performs best when S&P 500 rallies. \u2013 best years Bitcoin when S&P 500 return >15%.$BTC mostly retail, thus, mostly 'risk-on' \u2014 Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) October 25, 2019\n\nHowever, most people believe that bitcoin has a negative correlation with the stock market. That is, when stocks go down, like gold, BTC typically goes up.\n\nThis is key to the argument held by many, including Galaxy Digital\u2019s Mike Novogratz, that bitcoin is \u201cdigital gold\u201c.\n\nIn times of economic turmoil when stocks are down, investors typically turn to gold as a hedge. And there\u2019s a growing camp of bitcoiners who see BTC becoming the new safe-haven asset.\n\nThis is not supported by staunch gold supporters in the likes of long-term \u2018gold bug\u2019 Peter Schiff. The Euro Pacific Capital CEO never misses an opportunity to point out that BTC is not a safe-haven asset.\n\nBitcoin has again failed the safe haven test. On Friday, as escalating trade tensions sent global stock markets plunging, investors sought refuge in monetary safe havens. The Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and especially gold all moved higher. Yet Bitcoin plunged by more than stocks! \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) August 28, 2019\n\nBut if bitcoin indeed has a positive correlation with the stock market, and the S&P takes off, that means the asset class should also register significant gains.\n\nIt\u2019s not good news if the wider calls for a global recession toward the end of the year are right, however.\n\nJPMorgan Claims Global Recession Risk Is 40%\n\nAmid rising trade tensions and geopolitical issues, analysts at JPMorgan place the risk of recession as high as 40%.\n\nThey pointed to \u201cslow and uninspiring\u201d global growth but admitted that \u201cwe\u2019re not there yet\u201d. However, there were significant concerns.\n\nIf the global downturn indeed begins to bite, that won\u2019t be good for the S&P. And if Tom Lee is right, BTC could be in for a troublesome time.\n\nWill Tom Lee\u2019s bullish comments on the US stock market hold true for bitcoin?
