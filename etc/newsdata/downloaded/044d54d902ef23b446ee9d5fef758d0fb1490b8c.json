The group, which is the most powerful military and political force in Lebanon, said it meant the attack as retaliation to an Israeli drone strike against it in Beirut. Israel hasn\u2019t commented on the drone attack.\n\nIsrael and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, a peacekeeping mission, said calm returned to the area. But the incident has pushed the region closer to conflict as Israel aggressively attempts to contain Iran and its allies.\n\nIsrael has urged Lebanon to curtail Hezbollah\u2019s military activities in the country, as it expands its campaign to challenge Iranian military entrenchment in the region with attacks against Tehran and its allies in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria in recent days.\n\nSunday\u2019s incident closely mirrored what occurred in January 2015, when Hezbollah fired an antitank missile that hit an Israeli army vehicle near the Israel-Lebanon border, killing two Israeli soldiers. Hezbollah said that attack was in retaliation for Israel\u2019s alleged killing of Jihad Moughnieh, a senior Hezbollah commander. United Nations officials helped negotiate a cease-fire. Israel never claimed responsibility for the killing.\n\nThe latest Hezbollah attack initially stoked fears of a major military response from the Netanyahu government, but those concerns eased once Israel said it didn\u2019t suffer any casualties. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is touting his security credentials to win a tough re-election battle this month.\n\nMr. Netanyahu on Sunday said Israeli soldiers \u201chadn\u2019t [even suffered] a scratch,\u201d adding that his country was ready for any more developments.\n\nIsraeli officials said there were no restrictions for Israeli civilians as a result of the attack except for agricultural work on the border.\n\nThe attack came a day after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah reiterated threats to retaliate against the drone strike in Beirut.\n\n\u201cFor us, this is not a matter of a symbolic response, but is related to confirming [regional] equations, confirming the rules of engagement,\u201d Mr. Nasrallah said in a speech on Saturday.\n\nIsrael has intensified its campaign to thwart potential attacks from Iran and its allies in recent months, launching strikes targeting Iranian assets in Syria and Iraq. Iranian forces have attempted to launch rockets and missiles at Israel from Syria three times last year, Israeli military officials said. It recently carried out airstrikes in Syria to prevent what Israel said was a planned drone attack against the country. Two Hezbollah members were killed in the attack.\n\nThe Hezbollah unit that carried out Sunday\u2019s attack was named after the two fighters that were killed in Syria.\n\nThe Israeli military has bolstered its forces on the Lebanese border in recent days in anticipation of a Hezbollah reprisal. Earlier Sunday, Israel\u2019s military dropped incendiary material and fired artillery into a forested area close to the Israeli border, the official Lebanese news agency reported. An Israeli military spokesman said these measures weren\u2019t connected to the Hezbollah attack. The territory has been a base for Hezbollah to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers in the past.\n\nIn response to Sunday\u2019s incident, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Emmanuel Bonne, adviser to French President Emmanuel Macron. He asked the U.S., France and the international community to intervene, Lebanese state media reported.\n\nAndrea Tenenti, a spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, said the peacekeeping force has urged Lebanon and Israel to exercise restraint.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah last fought a war in 2006, when Hezbollah fired nearly 4,000 rockets at Israel over 34 days. More than 1,000 Lebanese, mostly civilians, and more than 100 Israelis, mostly soldiers, were killed in the conflict.\n\nIsrael on Thursday accused Hezbollah, with the help of Iran, of accelerating attempts to convert existing rockets into precision-guided missiles by smuggling the required components into Lebanon from Syria.\n\nMr. Nasrallah denied having precision-missile factories in Lebanon, but said the group has such missiles in the country.", "description": "Israel fired scores of artillery shells into southern Lebanon in response to a missile attack by Hezbollah, raising fears of a broader conflict amid growing regional tensions between Israel and Iran.", "authors": ["Dov Lieber In Tel Aviv", "Nazih Osseiran In Beirut", "Dov Lieber", "Dov.Lieber Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103208/social"}
