Yes, I can see the shape of it,\u201d Johnson asserted at a separate appearance before reporters at the British ambassador\u2019s residence.\n\nEU leaders were far more skeptical.\n\nWith the Brexit deadline just 45 days away, the European Commission said the first in-person meeting between Johnson and European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker ended with no breakthrough in the impasse over how Britain can leave the EU with a plan in place to manage the divorce.\n\nBritain had yet to offer any \u201clegally operational\u201d solutions to the problem of keeping goods and people flowing freely across the Irish border, the main roadblock to a deal, it said in a statement.\n\n\u201cSuch proposals have not yet been made,\u201d the Commission said, adding that officials \u201cwill remain available to work 24/7.\u201d\n\nJohnson insists the U.K. will leave the EU on the scheduled date of Oct. 31 with or without a Brexit deal. He hopes to strike a revised agreement with the bloc at an EU summit on Oct. 17-18, in time for an orderly departure. The agreement made by his predecessor, Theresa May, was rejected three times by Britain\u2019s Parliament, prompting her to resign.\n\nOpponents fear Johnson \u2014 who helped lead the 2016 referendum campaign that ended in a vote to leave the EU \u2014 is heading full-speed toward a disruptive no-deal Brexit.\n\nMany EU leaders suspect the same thing, and mistrust the brash British leader\u2019s populist rhetoric. Johnson has vowed to complete Brexit \u201cdo or die,\u201d and has compared himself and the U.K. to angry green superhero the Incredible Hulk, telling the Mail on Sunday newspaper: \u201cThe madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets, and he always escapes ... and that is the case for this country.\u201d\n\nLuxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, who also met Johnson on Monday, said the British leader needed to \u201cstop speaking and act.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need more than just words,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a legally operable text to work on as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe key sticking point to a Brexit deal is the so-called \u201cbackstop,\u201d an insurance policy in May\u2019s agreement intended to guarantee an open border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland. That is vital both to the local economy and to Northern Ireland\u2019s peace process.\n\nBritish Brexit supporters oppose the backstop because it keeps the U.K. bound to EU trade rules, limiting its ability to forge new free trade agreements around the world after Brexit.\n\nBritain has suggested the backstop could be replaced by \u201calternative arrangements\u201d \u2014 a mix of technology to replace border checks and a common area for agricultural products and animals covering the whole island of Ireland.\n\nA small but noisy crowd of anti-Brexit protesters booed and shouted \u201cshame on Boris!\u201d as Johnson arrived after lunch for a meeting with Luxembourg prime minister Bettel.\n\nJohnson pulled out of a planned outdoor news conference, saying later that the pair would have been drowned out. Instead Bettel addressed reporters alone, next to an empty lectern, while Johnson issued his statement outside the British ambassador\u2019s nearby residence.\n\nThe visibly frustrated Luxembourg leader said Brexit had become a \u201cnightmare,\u201d and U.K. and European citizens face huge uncertainty.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hold their future hostage for party political gains,\u201d Bettel said.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s on Mr. Johnson,\u201d he added, gesturing at the empty lectern in front of a Union Jack.\n\nDespite the EU\u2019s frustration at the lack of detail, Juncker and Johnson agreed to ramp up the pace of talks, with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and U.K. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay getting involved.\n\n\u201cOver the last couple of weeks there\u2019s been a lot of work \u2014 papers have been shared \u2014 but we are now in the stage where we have to start really accelerating the work,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat was the agreement today.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s meeting kicked off a tumultuous week for Johnson.\n\nOn Tuesday, Britain\u2019s Supreme Court will consider whether Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend the British Parliament for five weeks was lawful, after conflicting judgments in lower courts.\n\nJohnson sent British lawmakers home until Oct. 14, a drastic move that gives him a respite from rebellious lawmakers determined to thwart his Brexit plan.\n\nLast week, Scotland\u2019s highest civil court ruled the move illegal because it had the intention of stymieing Parliament. The High Court in London, however, said it was not a matter for the courts.\n\nIf the Supreme Court overturns the suspension, lawmakers could be called back to Parliament as early as next week.\n\nMany lawmakers fear a no-deal Brexit would be economically devastating, and are determined to stop the U.K. from crashing out of the bloc on Oct. 31.\n\nJust before the suspension, Parliament passed a law ordering the government to seek a three-month delay to Brexit if no agreement has been reached by late October.\n\nJohnson reiterated Monday that he will not seek a delay under any circumstances, though it\u2019s not clear how he can avoid it.\n\n\u201cI will uphold the constitution, I will obey the law but we will come out on October 31st,\u201d Johnson told the BBC.\n\nEU leaders, meanwhile, are reluctant to delay Brexit any longer unless Britain radically changes course.\n\n\u201cAn extension is only an option if it serves a purpose,\u201d Bettel said. \u201cWe will not grant another extension just for the sake of granting another extension.\u201d\n\nThe pound GBPUSD, -0.0161% traded lower on Monday, exchanging hands at $1.2420.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed Monday to ramp up talks on securing an elusive Brexit deal,...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR372_bojo_j_ZG_20190916114613.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
