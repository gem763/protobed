In recent days, company executives have bombarded contractors, including General Electric \u2019s Baker Hughes , with phone calls, faxes and emails seeking emergency assistance, according to Saudi officials and oil-services suppliers in the kingdom.\n\nOne Saudi official said costs could run in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the world\u2019s most profitable company are struggling to recover from the attacks, which came within weeks of the Saudi government reviving plans for its on-again, off-again initial public offering of Aramco shares. Now, the IPO, the company\u2019s financial health and the country\u2019s economy may be in danger, say Saudi officials and advisers.\n\nSaudi officials and Aramco executives have been consistent since the attacks, communicating statements aimed at reassuring oil markets that the state-owned company will recover quickly while continuing to supply customers as usual.\n\nOn Saturday, Aramco\u2019s Chief Executive Amin Nasser reiterated production would be back to its precrisis level by the end of the month. \u201cNot a single shipment to our international customers has been missed or canceled as a result of the attacks,\u201d he said. The company intends to return to its maximum output capacity by the end of November.\n\nAramco already has begun shipping equipment from the U.S. and Europe to rebuild damaged facilities, said Fahad al-Abdulkareem, the general manager of southern operations at Aramco.\n\nSaudi officials say there is little sense of calm at the highest levels of the company and the Saudi government, however. It could take some contractors up to a year to manufacture, deliver and install made-to-measure parts and equipment, the Saudi officials and the oil contractor said.\n\n\u201cWe are still in a frantic search for spare parts,\u201d one Saudi official said. \u201cIt is not really as great as rosy as you may think.\u201d\n\nLittle more than a week has passed since Khurais oil field and Abqaiq, the world\u2019s largest oil-processing facility, were struck by missiles, causing the largest single outage the oil industry has ever seen. The attack knocked out 5.7 million barrels a day of Saudi crude-oil production\u2014about half the country\u2019s output and nearly 6% of global supply.\n\nThe Trump administration and Saudi Arabia have blamed the attack on Iran, which has said it wasn\u2019t responsible.\n\nOn Sept. 14, the world woke up to see the biggest oil processing plant in Saudi Arabia burning. The smoke plume was visible from space. Planet Labs The damage was so extensive that it took 5% of the world\u2019s total oil supply off the market. Planet Labs But what was hit? Why was it so damaging? What does it tell us about the accuracy of the weapons used? Planet Labs The Processing Trains Planet Labs If their attackers wanted to hit something to cause maximum damage for the longest period of time, this would be the optimum target. A treatment and distribution center, these units remove hydrogen sulfide and reduce vapor pressure, making crude safe to ship. Planet Labs They are the very heart of the operation where the oil is separated into grades and readied for the market. Planet Labs Processing train components were under repair on Sept. 20. The Separation Tanks Planet Labs These neatly-hit spheroid domes were used to separate gas from oil before further processing Planet Labs A technical expert from the Atlantic Council, Phillip Cornell, says the hit was both precise and superficial (not deep enough to reach the gas and cause an ignition), suggesting it was struck by drones. U.S. government/Digital Globe via Associated Press Domes were under repair on Sept. 20. Storage Tanks Planet Labs What appears to be hit were tanks that hold water extracted from the crude processing. Planet Labs The tanks were under repair on Friday, Sept 20. Amr Nabil/Associated Press The Drainage Facility Planet Labs Oil was redirected to a drainage site outside the facility to keep the fires within the complex from spreading and engulfing it.

Eleven spherical structures that take gases out of the crude oil were hit at Abqaiq, as were another two tanks that hold water removed from the crude oil, the company said.\n\nThe extent of the damage means a return to normal operations at Abqaiq could take up to eight months, said some Saudi officials. Most technical experts who have seen the destruction firsthand said they share that view.\n\n\u201cRepairing the damaged units will take time, anywhere from two to nine months depending on the damage, even if Aramco had contingencies in place and spare tailor-made equipment,\u201d said IHS Markit in a note.\n\nThe Saudis reached out to Saipem SpA late last week and told the Italian contractor the kingdom would pay generously for repairs, said Saudi officials and a contractor with operations in the kingdom. Saipem is considering how it might assist Aramco but with $3.5 billion worth of contracts with Aramco signed in July, it is already overstretched in Saudi Arabia, the contractor said.\n\nSaipem is \u201csupporting [Aramco] in the assessment of damages caused by the attack\u201d at the Khurais field, where it already has contracts, the company said in an email.\n\nContractors can deliver many of the spare parts Aramco needs within a month or so, but only if they are rushed using air delivery at an extra cost of 50%, the contractor said. Made-to-measure turbines and compressors can typically take up to a year from the time they are ordered to be ready to install, the contractor said.\n\nAramco also has sought the help of General Electric\u2019s Baker Hughes and is negotiating with the company to help replace damaged machinery, according to Saudi officials and a contractor familiar with the negotiations.\n\nGeneral Electric, which acquired Baker Hughes in 2016, lost its controlling interest in the company last Monday. GE didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Baker Hughes declined to comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Aramco is working hard to keep a lid on the severity of its challenges. As part of a tour for the media on Friday, the company showed reporters and television crews a stabilizer that was completely blackened and another under repair that was in a somewhat better state. Hundreds of workers in hard hats were on the Khurais site, while cranes appeared to swing into action.\n\nAramco staffers say they were stunned when they saw the Saudi energy minister announce the company\u2019s triumphant recovery on international television last week.\n\n\u201cI have been honored by the king and crown prince,\u201d he said, \u201cto deliver the good news to citizens of this country and its supporters that oil supplies to market have returned to what they used to be.\u201d\n\nMany Aramco executives and board members, meanwhile, are privately expressing doubt that the company can meet its target of a three-week return. They estimate the production recovery will take twice as much time, according to people in touch with them.\n\nSome \u201cboard members are horrified\u201d that the company could communicate such optimistic assessments, said one of the people.\n\nFrom the moment fires from Abqaiq and Khurais began to light the Saudi sky last week, the company has been slow to come to grips with the scale of the attack and the extent of the damage, said Saudi officials.\n\n\u201cWe knew looking at the screens something very serious was going on, but we just did not know what it was,\u201d said an Aramco official.\n\nWhile the strikes were under way, entire sections of a display showing Aramco\u2019s facilities across Saudi Arabia went dark. Control-room staffers at Aramco\u2019s headquarters in Dhahran initially logged the incident as a series of routine fires.\n\nBut as firefighters tackled the blazes on the ground at the Khurais site, emergency staffers looked up and saw streaks across the sky as two more missiles whistled into the facility with a bang, said Aramco\u2019s Mr. al-Abdulkareem.\n\nIn total, four cruise missiles hit the Khurais facility on Saturday, each targeting the oil field\u2019s 98-foot stabilization towers. Metal debris from the structures was still scattered on the ground Friday.\n\n\u2014Sarah McFarlane contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com, Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com and Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com", "description": "Aramco is telling contractors to spare no expense getting facilities in working order after attacks.", "authors": ["Summer Said In Dubai", "Benoit Faucon In London", "Rory Jones In Riyadh", "Summer Said", "Benoit Faucon", "Rory Jones", "Summer.Said Wsj.Com", "Benoit.Faucon Wsj.Com", "Rory.Jones Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109681/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
