They could also oppose the unusually short timetable, with a vote on that planned for later the same day.\n\nEven if Johnson wins both of Tuesday's votes, MPs could then attempt to attach amendments to the bill, with opponents signaling either a second referendum or a requirement to stay in the EU's customs union might gather support from a majority in the Commons. Either would wreck Johnson's plan and instead renew the government's push for a general election.\n\n\"I hope parliament today votes to take back control for itself and the British people and the country can start to focus on the cost of living, the NHS, and conserving our environment,\" Johnson will tell MPs ahead of Tuesday's vote, according to a press briefing.\n\n\"The public doesn\u2019t want any more delays, neither do other European leaders and neither do I. Let\u2019s get Brexit done on 31 October and move on.\"\n\nThe Labour Party's Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer told MPs on Monday that the government was \u201ctrying to bounce MPs into signing off a bill that could cause huge damage.\u201d\n\n\"The truth is Boris Johnson knows that the more time people have to read the small print of his deal, the more it will be exposed for the risks it represents to our economy and communities across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Scottish National Party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, echoed the sentiment, saying it was \"an insult to democracy that the Tory government is trying to push this bill through on limited time.\"\n\nFor now, the EU is holding its breath, but if word comes that leaders in Brussels will grant an extension to negotiations, opposition MPs will see little incentive to stick to Johnson\u2019s timetable.\n\nDowning Street plan\n\nDowning Street officials are still hopeful they will get the numbers to push the deal through.\n\nMichael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal preparations, said Sunday that he could \u201cguarantee\u201d Brexit would be done in time. \u201cWe have the means and the ability to do so,\u201d he told Sky News' Sophy Ridge.\n\nOn Monday, he attempted to drive home the consequences of failure, announcing to MPs that he had triggered Operation Yellowhammer, the government's no-deal contingency plan, and officials would now meet seven days a week to discuss no-deal preparations.\n\nJohnson has the support of most of the hardline Brexiteers in his own Conservative Party, including Steve Baker, Owen Paterson and Anne Marie Morris. He also has secured the votes of several Labour MPs, including Melanie Onn, Gareth Snell and Sarah Champion. None of them voted for former Prime Minister Theresa May's deal, which was defeated by 58 votes on the third attempt.\n\nBut like May, Johnson is missing the support of the Conservative Party\u2019s informal partners in government, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\n\nThe DUP has been resolute in its opposition to the deal, because it says it creates a divergence in rules and regulations between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.\n\nIn a House of Lords committee hearing on Monday afternoon, a slip-up by the Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay was a gift to those making this point.\n\nAsked whether Northern Irish businesses would have to fill out customs declarations when sending goods to Great Britain, Barclay initially replied: \u201cWe\u2019ve said in terms of [trade] from NI to GB that it will be frictionless, and so there wouldn\u2019t be [declaration forms].\u201d\n\nBut a few minutes later, he interrupted the hearing to read out a correction: \u201cThe exit summary declarations will be required in terms of NI to GB.\u201d\n\nExit summary declarations are required when goods leave the EU\u2019s customs territory. The implication is that the exporters in Northern Ireland would have to complete paperwork in order to sell goods within their own country, the U.K.\n\nThe DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson did not pull his punches. \u201cClear breach of U.K. government commitment in Joint Report of 2017 [negotiated by May] to allow unfettered access to GB market for NI businesses,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cHow can any Conservative & Unionist MP argue this does not represent a border in the Irish Sea?!\u201d\n\nThe slip-up served to demonstrate the complexity of what MPs must consider in the starkest of ways: the U.K.\u2019s own Brexit secretary could not accurately recall the details of the deal\u2019s implications.\n\nThroughout the day Monday, MPs and peers expressed serious concerns at being asked to rush through such a momentous piece of legislation. Barclay\u2019s response was that they would have time to scrutinize it during the Brexit transition period \u2014 after it had passed.\n\nOne day at a time\n\nEven if the bill survives its first Commons vote with a narrow majority, it could yet be sunk on Wednesday.\n\nAny majority that exists for the proposal is fragile, made up of disparate factions of MPs, who only agree that some form of Brexit should occur.\n\nOnce amendments can be proposed to the legislation on Wednesday, the government faces the threat of a customs union or even a second referendum being appended to the deal.\n\nGloria De Piero, a Labour MP who has expressed her intention to vote for a deal and announced she is standing down at the next election, has tweeted that she will be backing a customs union amendment.\n\nWhen MPs held non-binding indicative votes in April on a series of possible Brexit outcomes, a customs union came the closest to getting a majority in the Commons. It was defeated by just three votes \u2014 276 to 273 \u2014 with a number of abstentions.\n\nThose who voted in favor of a customs union included most of the parliamentary Labour party, as well as 36 Tories \u2014 several of whom have since been expelled from the party, such as Ken Clarke, Alistair Burt, Margot James, Anne Milton, Oliver Letwin, and Stephen Hammond. The Liberal Democrats' Norman Lamb also backed the idea in the indicative vote.", "description": "The British prime minister may get a Brexit vote Tuesday but more parliamentary hurdles stand in his way.", "authors": ["Eleni Courea", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Annabelle Dickson"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1173267050-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
