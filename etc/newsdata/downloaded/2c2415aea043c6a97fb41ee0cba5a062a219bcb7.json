In fact, it's downright vile,\" the animal rights campaigner wrote.\n\n\"It's produced by ramming metal tubes down the throats of gentle geese and ducks in order to force-feed them until their livers swell up, pressing against their lungs and making it hard for them to breathe.\"\n\nAnderson added that serving \"this abhorrent p\u00e2t\u00e9\" is \"not in keeping with the Playboy brand\", recommending that the club consider offering vegan faux gras as an alternative.\n\nFoie gras is the liver of a duck or goose fattened by force feeding the bird with corn through a tube.\n\nFollowing the publication of the letter, Playboy Club London said it has taken the food off its menu and \"pledged never to serve it again\".\n\nAnderson, who is vegan, has a history of campaigning to have foie gras discredited.\n\n\"Over the past few years, she has written to London department store Fortnum and Mason urging it to ditch the vile, vile p\u00e2t\u00e9 and called on the French National Assembly to ban the force-feeding of geese and ducks,\" Dawn Carr, director of vegan corporate projects at Peta, said in October 2018.\n\n\"Consumers have the power to take a stand against foie gras by refusing to buy this 'torture in a tin' and instead choosing one of the many healthy and cruelty-free vegan vile p\u00e2t\u00e9s available.\"\n\nIn February, a bill which would ban the sale of foie gras in New York City restaurants was proposed.\n\nThe bill was put forward by New York City councilwoman Carlina Rivera, who described the proposed legislation as \"common sense\".\n\n\u201c[Foie gras] is not part of the diet of everyday New Yorkers,\" Ms Rivera said.\n\n\u201cLess than one per cent of all New York City restaurants serve it. This is truly a luxury item.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, California formally banned the sale and production of foie gras in the state.\n\nIf Californians are caught selling foie gras, they can face fines of up to $1,000 (\u00a3799).\n\nFoie gras is illegal to produce in the UK under animal welfare laws, the RSPCA states.\n\nThe food product is produced predominantly in France, Hungary, Bulgaria, Spain and Belgium.", "description": "Pamela Anderson has successfully managed to have foie gras removed from the menu at Playboy Club London after writing an open letter to the venue's director.", "authors": ["Sabrina Barr"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/14/12/pamela-anderson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
