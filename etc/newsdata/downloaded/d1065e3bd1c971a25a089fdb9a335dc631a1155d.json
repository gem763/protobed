Remarks indicating that the blacklist of Chinese companies is to be reviewed and that both Chinese investment and Chinese students are welcome in the US, suggest that it is now willing to adopt a healthier and more objective view of bilateral relations.\n\nAll in all, it seems that the complex and tortuous negotiations have at last produced something that both sides can live with, and that with agreements having been reached in principle they just need \"to be papered\" so that it can be signed into effect by President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump.\n\nThat done, it will be time to move on to the next stage - \"a big deal, covering so much territory\", as Trump described it - and both sides have reportedly already allocated various people to it. Which hopefully means that if the two countries do ink a deal on what they have agreed so far, they will be able to put in place a mechanism that will prevent their differences from faring up again so acutely in the future.\n\nBut while the negotiations do appear to have produced a fundamental understanding on the key issues and the broader benefits of friendly relations, the Champagne should probably be kept on ice, at least until the two presidents put pen to paper, as based on its past practice, there is always the possibility that Washington may decide to cancel the deal if it thinks that doing so will better serve its interests.\n\nThe US should avoid backpedaling, as it has in the past, and instead cherish what has been achieved as a manifestation of a healthy and steady China-US relationship that serves the interests of both countries and the world.", "description": "It has been a long time coming, but finally there seems to have been a breakthrough in the trade dispute between China and the United States.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/13/5da3133fa310cf3e97a1067f.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
