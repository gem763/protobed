What\u2019s more, Will was apprehensive about granting his fella\u2019s wish to have phone sex. Will was sure that the government was always listening, and \u201cthe last thing I wanna do is make another donation to Mike Pence\u2019s spank bank!\u201d Off Grace\u2019s suggestion that Will ask Karen to help him with the naughty talk, our favorite boozehound suggested that they try a little role-play: Will could be himself, and she\u2019d be \u201cthat incredibly handsome man who hasn\u2019t yet figured out he can do better.\u201d Hilariously, Karen only got more turned on when Will accidentally dropped the phone and seemed to be giving \u201cMcCoy\u201d the silent treatment. Her lips were loose enough for both of \u2019em, anyway, \u201cI bet you\u2019re wearing jeans,\u201d she purred. \u201cI bet they\u2019re tight. I bet they\u2019re women\u2019s jeans.\u201d Later, when Will gave the real McCoy the silent treatment, it didn\u2019t have the same effect whatsoever. In desperation, Will called Karen, who encouraged him to simply tell McCoy what he wanted. Which was\u2026 ? \u201cI don\u2019t want to be on hold anymore, I want to talk about us, our wedding, our future,\u201d he said, adding that he wanted to have a baby with McCoy.\n\nView photos will grace recap season 11 episode 1 pregnant baby More\n\n\u2018THE DOCTOR SAID IT WAS A GERIATRIC PREGNANCY!\u2019 | Meanwhile, Grace\u2019s visit to the doctor to have a bug bite checked out resulted in her learning that she was pregnant. Naturally, she couldn\u2019t wait to get home to tearfully discuss the surprising development, so she got a lady on the subway to lend her an ear. Isn\u2019t Grace a little\u2026 old? Yes, she acknowledged. \u201cThe doctor said it was a freaking miracle!\u201d But the timing of Grace\u2019s pregnancy couldn\u2019t be worse, in her estimation. After savoring her me time abroad, she\u2019d come up with such plans for her future. She was gonna do so many things. Was she, really? OK, she admitted to her confidante. \u201cI was gonna watch so many shows!\u201d After the woman heard about Grace\u2019s living situation and called her \u201ca seven-layer dip of mistakes,\u201d she told the mom-to-be that there\u2019s really no perfect time to have a baby; mothers just figure it out as they go and get used to the fear. Once Grace got home, she got the impression that Will knew she was expecting, and he got the impression that she knew he and McCoy were going to have a baby. Didn\u2019t Will worry that it was a mistake? \u201cA lot of people,\u201d she noted, \u201cthink that a baby should have a man in its life.\u201d Which, obviously, both Will and McCoy are. When at last the roomies figured out that they were both going to be parents, Will was ecstatic. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that I\u2019m a little old and unwed and\u2026 me?\u201d she asked. Very sweetly, Will said no. None of those things had even occurred to him.\n\nView photos will grace recap season 11 episode 1 pregnant baby More\n\n\u2018CAN YOU IMAGINE A LITTLE GAY FOOL BURSTING THROUGH THE DOOR EVERY HOUR ON THE HOUR?\u2019 | In the episode\u2019s B plot (C plot?), Jack waited until Estefan was flying out to hold a yard sale in the hallway in hopes of selling only one item: the gayest cuckoo clock ever conceived, a novelty that his husband had picked up on their honeymoon. (It struck me as odd that Jack wouldn\u2019t love the thing, considering that he\u2019d hoped his wedding would include a unicorn that shot cream out of its horn.) No sooner had Jack managed to unload the eyesore than Estefan came back. The pilot had had to turn the plane around, he explained, because \u201csome queen threw a ginger ale on Ann Coulter, and she melted.\u201d When Estefan learned what Jack had done, he said it was fine\u2026 so long as he could sell something his hubby loved: his \u201cbig-boy baby doll\u201d \u2014 Cher! When the toy wound up accidentally flying down the trash chute, Jack dove in after it. \u201cI got you, babe,\u201d he told his prized possession upon recovering it. Turned out, Jack had only gone to all the trouble of trying to sneakily get rid of the clock to avoid a fight with Estefan. His parents used to fight, and both Mom and Dad had gotten divorced. Well, he didn\u2019t need to worry about that with Estefan. \u201cI will always fight with you forever!\u201d he promised.", "description": "Warning: The following contains spoilers for the Season 11 premiere of Will & Grace.
