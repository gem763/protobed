She added birdies on Nos. 9, 11, 13, 14, 16 and 18 to get to 17 under at Brickyard Crossing, the layout that features four holes inside the Indianapolis Motor Speedway oval.\n\nThis is my first time ever in my life I had a lead all three rounds,\u201d Hur said. \u201cSo, I just want to keep it.\u201d\n\nThe South Korean player won the Ladies Scottish Open last month for her third LPGA Tour victory.\n\nShe doubled her lead with the birdie on 18.\n\n\u201cThat was my best birdie for all three rounds,\u201d Hur said. \u201cBefore I putt it, I was thinking about it. I knew I was ahead by one and I was thinking two-shot lead would be a little bit easier for me for tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHur opened with a 63 to take a two-stroke lead and kept in Friday with a 70 in windy conditions.\n\nMarina Alex, coming off the United States\u2019 Solheim Cup loss to Europe, was second after a 64.\n\n\u201cI was able to get many more birdie opportunities,\u201d Alex said. \u201cI just felt like I didn\u2019t play a whole lot different, it was just the course allowed for more birdies today.\u201d\n\nShe won the Cambia Portland Classic last year for her lone LPGA Tour title.\n\nPuerto Rico\u2019s Maria Torres had a 66 to get to 13 under.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mi Jung Hur kept her two-stroke lead in the Indy Women in Tech Championship on Saturday, birdieing five of the final eight holes for a 6-under 66.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
