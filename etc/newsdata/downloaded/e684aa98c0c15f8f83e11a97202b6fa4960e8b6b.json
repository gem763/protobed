The film followed a man and a woman who meet on a train and spend an enchanted day together falling in love, both knowing it is likely the last time their paths would ever cross again\n\nBy the time director Richard Linklater created the third installment in 2013, Before Midnight, Julie's efforts paid off and she was granted the same pay as Ethan in her fight against gender pay disparity.\n\n'As a woman, you know you're paid less than a man as a writer, as a director, as an actress,' she said of her advocating efforts.\n\nWhile fans have pined for another addition to the Before series, Julie's not sure their wishes will be granted as the world might not be ready 'to hear a 50-year-old woman expressing herself.'\n\nStill strong: Nine years later, they encounter each other once again while in France for the 2004 film Before Sunset\n\nShe added: I think it\u2019s all cute before that \u2026 It\u2019s a very tough business, and it\u2019s fine because I\u2019m tough as hell, but it\u2019s a cruel business.\n\n'I think we\u2019re done now ... but we went back to it every nine years. It was an interesting study of a 20-year-old falling in love, a 30-year-old falling in love again and then at early 40\u2019s how to sustain that love. It\u2019s really about the relationship.'\n\nJulie has since turned her acting interests into pursuits behind the camera and directed, wrote and starred in her latest flick, My Zoe.", "description": "The 49-year-old actress admitted to Variety during the Zurich Film Festival that she was paid significantly less than her co-star and had to fight for equal compensation.", "authors": ["Tracy Wright For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/22/19273056-0-image-a-108_1570138512574.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
