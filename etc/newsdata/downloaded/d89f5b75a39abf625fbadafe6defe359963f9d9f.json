Adding international far-right groups to their list could give federal prosecutors more tools to go after radicals suspected of conspiring with those organizations before an attack happens.\n\nOn Wednesday, New York Rep. Max Rose, who chairs the counterterrorism subcommittee, submitted a letter to the State Department, co-signed by 39 members of Congress. It urged the department to designate Azov Battalion (a far-right paramilitary regiment in Ukraine), National Action (a neo-Nazi group based in the U.K.), and Nordic Resistance Movement (a neo-Nazi network from Scandinavia) as terrorist organizations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the threat we face today is of a self-radicalized gunman,\u201d Rose, a Democrat, told VICE News. \u201cSomebody who has been radicalized online, whether it\u2019s in accordance with jihadi ideology or a global white nationalist, neo-Nazi group.\u201d\n\nRead more: The U.S. doesn't prosecute far-right extremists as terrorists. Here's how it could.\n\nThere is currently no domestic terror statute in the U.S. To charge a person with terrorism, prosecutors have to prove that they\u2019re affiliated with one of the 67 groups labeled as a foreign terror organization (FTO) by the State Department.\n\nThe attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March was a major turning point for the way extremism experts approached white nationalist terror. The shooter, a white nationalist from Australia, shared a manifesto online that was replete with memes and ideas trafficked by far-right extremists around the globe. The manifesto itself was titled \u201cThe Great Replacement,\u201d which is a white nationalist conspiracy theory drawn from a book by a French author, and the inspiration behind the chants of \u201cYou will not replace us\u201d heard at the violent rally in Charlottesville two years ago.\n\nSince the Christchurch mosque massacres, there have been similar attacks at a synagogue in Poway, California, a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, and most recently, near a synagogue in Halle, Germany.\n\nIn all cases, the shooters shared their own manifestos online that spoke to an international audience of white nationalist extremists who share a common goal of destabilizing society through violence to establish a \u201cwhite homeland.\u201d\n\nRead more: How the Germany synagogue shooter\u2019s manifesto follows the far-right playbook.\n\nIn the seven months since Christchurch, there have been at least six congressional hearings on the issue of white nationalist terror. In those hearings, members of Congress have heard from intelligence officials and experts who have repeatedly stressed the seriousness of the threat posed by global far-right terror. Between 2009 and 2018, right-wing extremists, like white nationalists, accounted for 73% of extremist murders in the U.S., compared to 23% by jihadis, according to the ADL. And last month, DHS unveiled a new counterterrorism strategy that, for the first time, placed a major emphasis on fighting white nationalist terror.\n\nWhich is why Rose was surprised that not a single House Republican was willing to back the letter he submitted to the State Department.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m baffled as to why my Republican colleagues have refused to sign on to this,\u201d said Rose. \u201cNot only are Azov Battalion, National Action, and Nordic Resistance Movement directly connected to inspiring attacks in the homeland, they\u2019re direct purveyors of anti-Semitic ideologies that inspire attacks against Jews. It\u2019s curious to me that the Republican Party, for the better half of this year, are claiming they\u2019re against anti-Semitism. Here they have an opportunity to label it, but they\u2019re not willing to stand against it.\"\n\nFormer FBI agent Ali Soufan, who heads global security research organization the Soufan Center, recently testified before Congress about the threat, saying that the way white nationalists were organizing internationally looked a lot like al-Qaeda in the 1990s.\n\nAccording to a recent report by the Soufan Center, some 17,000 foreigners from 50 countries \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 have traveled to Ukraine to fight in the war there since 2014. Many of those fighters joined the Azov Battalion, which embraces neo-Nazi symbols, and then returned to their home countries with new paramilitary skills.\n\nThe U.S. State Department effectively treats those returning fighters as nothing more than Americans coming back from an extended trip abroad.\n\nBut Azov has been implicated in a number of violent incidents outside of Ukraine. The Soufan Center has identified ties between the Christchurch shooter and Azov: The gunman had traveled to Ukraine in the years prior to the attack, and he'd embellished his firearm with symbols associated with the regiment (Azov has refuted Soufan\u2019s reporting and stated that the group had no relation to the New Zealand shooter).\n\nThe Rise Above Movement, a U.S.-based street-fighting gang, sent some of its members to train with Azov in 2018, according to the FBI. And an American soldier was recently arrested for sharing bomb-making manuals online. According to the federal complaint, he\u2019d discussed joining Azov. And as Rose\u2019s letter points out, the government is well aware of Azov\u2019s extremist leanings: In March 2018, Congress added a provision to its spending bill that barred the U.S. from arming Azov in the fight against Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine because of its ties to neo-Nazis.\n\nRead more: How Telegram became white nationalists' go-to messaging platform.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Home Office designated National Action as a terrorist organization in 2016 \u2014 the first time the British government had flagged a far-right group as such since World War II. Researchers in the U.K. have identified relationships between National Action and groups like American Vanguard, which the neo-Nazi who drove his car into a crowd of protesters during Charlottesville reportedly belonged to.\n\n\n\nHere's the State Department\u2019s criteria for FTO designation: A group has to be foreign; have the capacity and intent to engage in terrorism; and threaten the security of U.S. nationals, the security of foreign allies, or economic interests in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThere are numerous examples of foreign white nationalist groups that fit these conditions,\u201d Rose wrote in his letter. \u201cThe American people deserve an explanation as to why these groups are not included on the FTO list.\u201d\n\nRose and his 39 co-signers asked the State Department to respond to their letter by Nov. 4.\n\nIn a response to VICE News\u2019 request for comment, a spokesperson for the State Department wrote \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss deliberations or the potential deliberations of our designations process.\u201d\n\nCover: Combatants of Ukrainian Azov battalion pray near Bohdan Khmelnytsky monument before they were sent on a theater of ATO.
