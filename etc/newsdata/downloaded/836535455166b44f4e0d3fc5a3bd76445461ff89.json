Footage from surveillance cameras suggested there was a break-in, regional police chief Mykola Zhykovych told Ukrainian media.\n\nThe US Embassy called for an \"urgent and thorough investigation\" while a joint statement by the European and American business associations warned that \"such situations are sending the wrong message\".\n\nGontareva, an investment banker, was appointed to the central bank post in 2014, shortly after war broke out in eastern Ukraine following the declaration of independence by pro-Russian separatists in the region.\n\nRespected in the West for her reforms in Ukraine's murky financial sector, Gontareva resigned in 2017 after coming under intense pressure from tycoons and lawmakers who wanted to throw her in jail for devaluating the national currency.\n\nUkrainian investigators conducted searches last week in Gontareva's flat in Kiev as part of a criminal case into abuse of power.\n\nGontareva came into conflict with Ukrainian oligarch Igor Kolomoisky, whom she accused of siphoning $5.5 billion from the country's largest bank PrivatBank, which was nationalised in 2016.\n\nKolomoisky, who returned to Ukraine this year after living abroad, has links to former comedian President Zelensky.\n\nThe oligarch's channel broadcasts Zelensky's shows, and Zelensky has employed several people who formerly worked for Kolomoisky.\n\nZelensky earlier this month met Kolomoisky, who is looking to invalidate PrivatBank's nationalisation.\n\nThe tycoon denied the two discussed a deal on PrivatBank, but said he saw a \"good window of opportunity\" for a \"settlement\".", "description": "Ukrainian police on Tuesday investigated a fire that destroyed the house of a reformist former central bank chief, who along with the bank called it an act of \"terror\".
