But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it isn\u2019t available at Amazon for all that much longer, now that its cover encourages Amazon workers to form a labor union.\n\nThis past Thursday, Monteiro tells The Verge, he realized he could change his self-published book\u2019s cover as easily as uploading a new PDF \u2014 and used it to add a new message to Amazon workers they\u2019ll presumably see as they print and package it for delivery.\n\nEvery time you buy my book from Amazon, a warehouse worker has to pull it off the shelf. From now on, this is what that worker will see. At least until Amazon shitcans the whole thing.

While Monteiro says he\u2019s sold over 10,000 copies of the book so far, only 150 paperbacks have been printed since he changed the cover, which isn\u2019t a lot of opportunities for it to catch the right person\u2019s eye.\n\nMonteiro says he was working on some union organizing when he came up with the idea: \u201cWe were discussing how to get messages in front of people and I realized \u2018Oh, huh. I have this thing that Amazon workers see every time a book gets ordered. Let\u2019s put a message there.\u2019\u201d\n\nAmazon hasn\u2019t contacted him yet, he says \u2014 even though the book\u2019s updated cover went through one of Amazon\u2019s QA processes.\n\nWe\u2019ve been tracking Amazon worker protests following the news that the company robotically tracks and terminates workers who fail to meet quotas, some of whom skip bathroom breaks just to keep their jobs.
