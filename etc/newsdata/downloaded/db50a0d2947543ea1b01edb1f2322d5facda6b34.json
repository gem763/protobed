What\u2019s more, their abortion costs are likely to go up.\n\nResearchers from Texas A&M University analyzed the impacts of Tennessee\u2019s mandatory waiting period (MWP), which was enacted in 2015 and requires that a minimum of 48 hours elapse between in-person counseling and a woman\u2019s abortion.\n\nLaws requiring two visits to a clinic are associated with a $107 increase in the price of an abortion, according to one 2015 analysis.\n\nThe policy increased the share of Tennessee women getting second-trimester abortions in 2016 by 4.1 percentage points, they found \u2014 a 62% increase from 2014. The number of abortions fell overall by 6%, though the authors cautioned that estimate had \u201climited statistical power.\u201d\n\nThe waiting period also carried an added financial cost of up to $929, the study authors estimated. \u201cIn total, the mandatory waiting period could increase the monetary cost of obtaining an abortion by a total of over $900 when accounting for fees, transportation costs, lost wages, and child-care,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive-health think tank that supports abortion rights, points out that \u201cfirst-trimester abortions are much less expensive than second-trimester procedures, often by several hundred dollars.\u201d\n\nStudy co-author Jason Lindo, an economics professor at Texas A&M and research associate at NBER, has served as \u201can expert witness in litigation regarding abortion regulations, including litigation regarding the regulation examined in this study,\u201d the paper discloses.\n\nAnti-abortion groups say the unborn have a right to life, believe life begins at fertilization and object to abortion on moral grounds.\n\nThe anti-abortion advocacy group National Right to Life says that many single mothers \u201cfind free help and support from local pregnancy care centers.\u201d The group also suggests giving the baby up for adoption as an alternative for people who can\u2019t afford to care for a baby.\n\nRepublicans say they oppose \u201ctaxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d Anti-abortion groups say the unborn have a right to life, believe life begins at fertilization and object to abortion on moral grounds. They comprise a range of views from those who believe abortion is wrong under any circumstance to others who believe it\u2019s acceptable in cases of rape, incest or when a woman\u2019s life is at risk.\n\nThat said, some 71% of voters oppose overturning Roe v. Wade, a July poll from The Wall Street Journal and NBC News found.\n\nNine in 10 abortions are performed within the first 13 weeks of pregnancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And, as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists notes, \u201cabortion-related mortality increases with each week of gestation\u201d \u2014 though the risk of childbirth-related death remains far higher.\n\nWomen are required to get counseling before they can have an abortion in 34 states, 14 of which require the counseling be delivered in person, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Twenty-seven of those states mandate a typically 24-hour waiting period from counseling to procedure, and waiting periods can stretch as long as 72 hours in states like Arkansas, Missouri and North Carolina.\n\nWomen who obtained second-trimester abortions paid an average of $854, compared to the average of $397 paid by first-trimester patients.\n\n\u201cIn states in which the counseling must be obtained in person (rather than via mail, fax, Internet or phone) and the woman must then wait a specified time period \u2026 between the counseling and the procedure, the woman is effectively required to make two trips to the health care provider in order to obtain an abortion, a requirement that could constitute a hardship for some women,\u201d Guttmacher says.\n\nIndeed, laws requiring two visits to a clinic are associated with a $107 increase in the price of an abortion, according to one 2015 analysis of two-visit and Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers laws.\n\nAdvocates for mandatory waiting periods, meanwhile, \u201cargue that they ensure women will receive information about pregnancy and abortion and will have ample time to weigh their options before deciding to terminate a pregnancy,\u201d the present study\u2019s authors note.\n\nAbortion costs tend to rise after the first trimester, partly due to the amount of time and level of skill required to perform the procedure, Guttmacher Institute principal research scientist Rachel Jones previously told MarketWatch; 2013 research co-authored by Jones found that women who obtained second-trimester abortions paid an average of $854, compared to the average of $397 paid by first-trimester patients.\n\nSix months after being denied an abortion, women were less likely to be employed full-time and more likely to be dependent on public assistance.\n\nThree in four women who obtain abortions are low-income, and almost half live below the federal poverty level, research shows. Meanwhile, women who are denied abortions are more likely to endure long-term \u201ceconomic hardship and insecurity\u201d than women who receive abortions, according to a 2018 study published in the American Journal of Public Health.\n\nSix months after being denied an abortion, women were less likely to be employed full-time and more likely to be dependent on public assistance, it added. The findings indicated that women who were denied a wanted abortion had four times greater odds of having a household income below the federal poverty level and three times greater odds of being unemployed after six months.\n\n\u201cThe additional financial costs for a woman to obtain an abortion caused by Tennessee\u2019s mandatory waiting period over and above prior costs can amount to a very large share of women\u2019s monthly income,\u201d the Texas A&M researchers wrote.", "description": "Abortion costs tend to rise after the first trimester, partly due to the amount of time and level of skill required to perform the procedure.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ964_aborti_ZG_20190909153011.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
