Lores and Chief Financial Officer Steve Fieler laid out a financial road map for the company\u2019s fiscal year 2020 several hours before HP\u2019s analyst day was to start.\n\nThe boldest move is a job reduction of up to 13% to 16% of HP\u2019s 55,000 employees worldwide to save $1 billion in operation costs. Those savings, in turn, would be invested in software and services as HP HPQ, -1.02% attempts to \u201creinvent business,\u201d Lores said.\n\nHP shares slid 3% at $17.83 in after-hours trading Thursday.\n\nCorporate disruption and transformation will also come from evolving personal systems (PCs) and printers with a focus on services, expanding beyond hardware to create \u201ctrue end-to-end solutions\u201d for customers, and \u201ca new operating model that puts our teams closer to our customers,\u201d according to the 80-year-old company that was famously started in a garage in Palo Alto, Calif.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new chapter for HP,\u201d Lores, a 30-year veteran of HP who most recently led its $20-billion printer division, told MarketWatch. Lores, who takes over Nov. 1, was named successor to Dion Weisler in August. Weisler is returning to his native Australia because of a \u201cfamily health matter\u201d but remains on HP\u2019s board.\n\nRead more: HP Inc. names head of printer division as new CEO\n\nLores inherits a company whose printer supply revenue in the recently completed third quarter dove 7% to $3.2 billion \u2014 its worst year-over-year performance in three years, and Weisler warned of \u201cmacroeconomic softness.\u201d HP shares are down 30% the past 12 months, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.80% has been flat.\n\nHP did not specify which divisions would be affected by layoffs, only that it was \u201cchanging processes for back-end infrastructure\u201d and becoming more digitally focused, said Fieler.\n\nThe bottom-line impact, Fieler estimates, is non-GAAP earnings for fiscal 2020 of $2.22 to $2.32 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $2.24 a share. Additionally, HP raised its dividend by 10% and authorized an additional $5 billion for future repurchases of its outstanding shares of common stock.\n\nHP is \u201cmoving to services, and the only way to get there is to invest $1 billion,\u201d Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, told MarketWatch. Moorhead was briefed by HP on Thursday. \u201cThey have come up with the right story for Wall Street\u201d and a more effective way to compete with Dell Technologies Inc. DELL, +0.55% and VMware Inc. VMW, +0.60% as HP sells hardware and supplies to customers, he added.\n\nHP\u2019s corporate reboot is its latest since it and Hewlett Packard Enterprise were split from Hewlett-Packard Co. in late 2015. Last year, HP announced 4,500 to 5,000 jobs would be eliminated at the end of fiscal 2019.\n\nThe cyclical PC market has been no help. As it ebbs and flows, so do the fortunes of HP, says Crawford del Prete, president of International Data Corp. \u201cThis goes with the territory,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cSo, they are trying to streamline operations and invest in new business models.\u201d VMW, +0.60%", "description": "HP Inc. on Thursday announced a major restructuring that will eliminate 7,000 to 9,000 jobs over the next three years as part of a series of moves to...", "authors": ["Jon Swartz", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS408_HP_ZG_20191001120538.jpg"}
