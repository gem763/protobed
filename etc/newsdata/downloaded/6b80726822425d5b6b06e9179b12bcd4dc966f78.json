They should get into or close to the final if Manu Tuilagi stays fit. He's the most important player in that team for England to go deep in the competition.\n\nAnd I like Ford-Farrell at 10 and 12. Ford has a really good ability to read the game, and if he does get caught with the ball there is someone else at first-receiver who can continue the game. Eddie likes that.\n\nI ran into Owen the other day in my hotel. When he went on the 2013 Lions tour as a 22-year-old I invited Brian O'Driscoll to come to dinner in Brisbane.\n\nEddie Jones' side should get into or close to the World Cup final if Manu Tuilagi stays fit\n\nOwen Farrell is a very measured, mistake-free player which is what you need in World Cups\n\nI know Brian really well and just thought it would nice for him to have a home-cooked dinner rather than eat at the hotel buffet, and said: 'why don't you bring a young player who can experience getting out of the hotel' so Owen came out.\n\nHe was pretty quiet! But he came to our place for dinner, and you could see how determined he was.\n\nHe's not a Dan Carter or a Jonny Wilkinson but he is a very measured, mistake-free player which is what you need in World Cups.\n\nIn my three World Cups I found the most-important match was the quarter-final.\n\nIt's a new competition now after the Pool stage. You lose your quarter-final and you're on the plane home. If players can get that realisation in their heads - how desperate you have to be - it helps.\n\nSemi-finals and finals look after themselves. I only lost to England once - in the 1995 quarter-final. The embarrassment of seeing 2,000 fans waiting to get on planes at Perth airport when we had just come back from Johannesburg having been knocked out was awful.\n\nThe Wallabies have fight in them and must get at England from the off during the quarters\n\nBack in the present Australia have been treading water. But I have full confidence in how they're going to play at the weekend. They've got one half in them.\n\nThey had one good half against Wales when they came back, but gave them too much of a start.\n\nThere's potentially a really good game in them - they need to pull it out now, as you can't keep going back to beating the All Blacks 47-26 in Perth - that's six Test-matches ago. They can't hang onto that.\n\nWe won't beat England if we try to bash them - we've got to be skilful, play quick-paced, fitter rugby and get offloads away. That's a risk, but Michael Cheika won't want them to kick the ball away.\n\nThe Wallabies have some fight in them. Eddie knows they're coming. It's just whether the players do.", "description": "TIM HORAN - INSIGHT: Australia are underdogs against England and we like that. England are a pretty complete team at Twickenham.
