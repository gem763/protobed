The latest reports are that he'll be transfer-listed come January, so the playmaker may well see this international break as a way to put himself in the shop window of Europe's top clubs.\n\nEveryone is waiting to see whether the old Eriksen will turn it on for Denmark, away from the negative air currently engulfing Mauricio Pochettino's out-of-form side.\n\nFixtures: vs Switzerland (H), Saturday Oct 12 & vs Luxembourg (H), Tuesday Oct 15\n\nChristian Eriksen has struggled for Spurs of late, and all eyes will be on him in a Denmark shirt\n\nMarcus Rashford (Manchester United and England)\n\nA very similar scenario awaits Rashford, as he gets away from a disappointed club dressing room to join his international colleagues in Gareth Southgate's notoriously jovial one with England. Pressure has been heaped on his shoulders at Manchester United, and he has been entrusted to fire the club back up the Premier League.\n\nWith Harry Kane alongside him, who also will likely enjoy his time away from club duty, can the pair find a bit of form and dust off those shooting boots that have been hidden for the last few weeks?\n\nFixtures: vs Czech Republic (A), Friday Oct 11 & vs Bulgaria (A), Monday Oct 14\n\nMarcus Rashford has been under pressure at United, and may relish him time with England\n\nMichael Keane (Everton and England)\n\nSince last playing for England, Michael Keane has conceded nine goals in four games at the heart of Everton's defence, losing every single fixture. He will be glad to head to St Georges' Park and to a team that are expected to win both games.\n\nHis personal form has been well below-par too... in his second season at Everton he shone but is thought by many fans to have now gone backwards to the levels of his disappointing first campaign at Goodison. Despite that, Southgate has stuck by him and a couple of impressive displays here will help his confidence no end.\n\nFixtures: vs Czech Republic (A), Friday Oct 11 & vs Bulgaria (A), Monday Oct 14\n\nMichael Keane (centre) is struggling for form, but is still a big part of the England set-up\n\nNicolas Otamendi (Manchester City and Argentina)\n\nAnother centre back in poor form, and at the worst time for Pep Guardiola with a series of injuries really stunting the club's progression in their battle with Liverpool at the top of the league. Otamendi will be expected to step up for his country in a really tough game against Germany, in which he could well wear the captain's armband.\n\nAt City, some fans are calling for him to be dropped in place of 18-year-old Eric Garcia, so the Argentine could do with a couple of impressive displays to get him back onside with the Etihad supporters frustrated with him - and the entire team - at dropping eight points behind Liverpool.\n\nFixtures: vs Germany (A), Wednesday Oct 9 & vs Ecuador (A), Sunday Oct 13\n\nCity's Nicolas Otamendi could captain Argentina against Germany on Wednesday night\n\nGareth Bale (Real Madrid and Wales)\n\nBale's struggles at club level have been well-documented, and the latest reports from Spain are that he wants to leave in the summer and will try and force an exit from the club. One thing that is for sure is that the Welshman loves going home and playing for his country.\n\nWhen on international duty, he's the main man, the team play to his strengths - and he's easily the best player in the side. Two upcoming matches against Slovakia and Croatia will give Bale the chance to put on a show, in the knowledge that Zinedine Zidane will be watching closely.\n\nFixtures: vs Slovakia (A), Thursday Oct 10 & vs Croatia (H), Sunday Oct 13\n\nGareth Bale will love being back home in Wales after a difficult period with Real Madrid\n\nDavid de Gea (Manchester United and Spain)\n\nManchester United sit just two points outside the relegation zone in the Premier League, and De Gea has received much stick for his part in their failings over recent weeks. With Liverpool up next, things may continue to get worse, so the keeper will be happy to rid himself of his club-level stresses for a week or so.\n\nThat said, it's not been plain sailing for Spain either, with Kepa currently their No 1 after knocking De Gea off his long-term perch a few months ago. If he gets some time between the sticks, it's clear the United man has much to prove.\n\nFixtures: vs Norway (A), Saturday Oct 12 & vs Sweden (A), Tuesday Oct 15\n\nDavid de Gea is having a torrid time and will want to take his chance with Spain when it comes\n\nPhil Foden (Manchester City and England Under 21s)\n\nHaving played just 10 minutes of Premier League football this season, Foden is well within his rights to feel frustrated at Manchester City. His talent is abundantly clear but he has struggled to break through to City's star-studded first team.\n\nFor England U21s though, the youngster is the main man and will likely play two full games over the next fortnight. If there was ever a chance to make Guardiola sit up and notice, this is it...\n\nFixtures: vs Slovenia U21s (A), Friday Oct 11 & Austria U21s (H), Tuesday Oct 15\n\nPhil Foden could look at Under 21s duty over the next fortnight as his Manchester City audition\n\nRoss Barkley (Chelsea and England)\n\nThe former Everton midfielder is almost becoming the forgotten man at Chelsea, and has not played a minute of football over the last couple of weeks, dropped for the likes of Jorginho and Mason Mount.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Gareth Southgate has stuck with him in the England set-up, opting to call him up over the likes of Jack Grealish. He needs to get stuck in when he gets the chance this week, and prove himself to Frank Lampard once more.\n\nFixtures: vs Czech Republic (A), Friday Oct 11 & vs Bulgaria (A), Monday Oct 14\n\nRoss Barkley is the forgotten man at Chelsea but still has a chance to impress for England\n\nMarc-Andre Ter Stegen (Barcelona and Germany)\n\nThe Barcelona goalkeeper has been involved in a very public spat with Manuel Neuer and Bayern Munich over Germany's No 1 spot. Bayern threatened to boycott the national team if Neuer was displaced, but it has been confirmed that Ter Stegen will get 90 of the 180 minutes Germany are set to play over the international break.\n\nHe will be desperate to prove his doubters wrong and cause more difficulties for Joachim Low by keeping a clean sheet, before heading back to the Nou Camp to prepare for the upcoming first Clasico of the season. It's a big month ahead.\n\nFixtures: vs Argentina (H), Wednesday Oct 9 & Estonia (A), Sunday Oct 13\n\nIt has already been confirmed that Marc-Andre Ter Stegen will play at least once for Germany\n\nChristian Benteke (Crystal Palace and Belgium)\n\nIt was a surprise to many to see Benteke in Belgium's most recent squad, given he isn't even starting for Crystal Palace at the moment. The striker is playing second fiddle to Jordan Ayew, and has scored one goal since April 2018... that's one goal in 30 matches.\n\nPalace fans are furious with his form, but he will be hopeful that an appearance off the bench for his national team against minnows San Marino or Kazakhstan could see him score and spark some desperately-needed form. If he doesn't net again this season, he will surely be out the door at Selhurst Park come next summer.\n\nFixtures: vs San Marino (H), Thursday Oct 10 & Kazakhstan (A), Sunday Oct 13", "description": "As an exciting club football season is pushed to one side for a fortnight, the international fixtures are set to come to the fore.
