Critics have accused Gabbard of parroting Syrian and Russian talking points in saying the U.S. has supported \u201cterrorists\u201d in Syria.\n\nGabbard on Tuesday said it is \u201ccompletely despicable\u201d that critics of her stance on the Syrian civil war label her a \u201cRussian asset\u201d and an \u201cAssad apologist.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs president I will end these regime change wars by doing two things: ending the draconian sanctions that are really a modern-day siege the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen that have caused tens of thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve, and I would make sure that we stop supporting terrorists like al Qaeda in Syria,\u201d she said.\n\nButtigieg said that while he didn\u2019t support the Iraq War and thinks the United States should withdraw from Afghanistan, a small number of special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were \u201cthe only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we\u2019re seeing now, which the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, soldiers in the field are reporting that for the first time, they feel ashamed, ashamed of what their country has done,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen I deployed, I knew one of the things that was keeping me safe was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country known to keep its word, and our allies knew it, and our enemies knew it. You take that away, you are taking away what makes America America.\u201d\n\nGabbard responded to Buttigieg by saying he would have U.S. troops in Syria for \u201can indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would continue to have our country involved in a war that has undermined our national security. You would continue this policy of the U.S. actually providing arms and support to terrorist groups in Syria like al Qaeda \u2026 That\u2019s really what you\u2019re saying,\" she said.\n\nButtigieg replied that it is possible to \u201cend endless wars\u201d without embracing Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nGabbard interjected, asking Buttigieg, \u201cWill you end the regime change wars?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word,\u201d Buttigieg responded. \u201cPart of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is undermining the honor of our soldiers,\u201d he added. \u201cYou take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next.\u201d", "description": "Rep.
