Barring only a handful of exceptions, it\u2019s born out every election cycle since 1860: whoever has bagged the heartland state has gone to the White House.\n\nBut as the presidential campaigns gear up for 2020, national political strategists are betting that\u2019s no longer the case. Ohio, they argue, simply isn\u2019t the electoral predictor it once was.\n\nThe shift is the result of changing demographics. Ohio voters in 2019 look a lot less like the rest of the country than they once did: they are whiter, older, and less schooled. Meanwhile, populations in other states like Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina are trending the opposite direction\u2014becoming more diverse and younger, and more well-educated. As that shift intensifies, Ohio is on track to become solidly Republican, while other states are more likely to swing Democratic\u2014forever changing that predictable national electoral map.\n\nTop national Republican and Democratic strategists are urging party leadership this time around to put less emphasis on Ohio\u2019s 18 electoral votes as a once-indispensable stepping stone to the 270 required to win the Presidency. National Republicans say the famously swingy state threatens to consume a disproportionate share of party resources, while National Democrats, argue there are simply more efficient places to route resources and ad buys.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

It\u2019s less a question of the past and more a question about what states are likely to decide the election.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ohio-based political operatives of both parties are pushing back. Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken says that the reason Republicans have done well in Ohio in recent elections is not because of demographic inevitabilities, but because the GOP has invested heavily in the state. \u201cWe are not going to let up. We are going to treat Ohio as a swing state. Because we need to makes sure the President wins Ohio and its 18 Electoral College votes,\u201d Timken tells TIME. \u201cI think Ohio is trending red, but I think it\u2019s in part because of the work we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Timken successfully leveraged Trump\u2019s popularity among activists, amassing more than 5 million voter contacts. Bucking national trends, Ohio Democrats failed to pick up a single U.S. House seat. (Democrats did, however, net six state House seats and two Supreme Court seats.) She argues that Ohio is culturally Republican. \u201cWe care about things like football on Friday nights, going out to restaurants once in a while, going to church on Sunday,\u201d Timken says. \u201cThe messaging that we\u2019re getting from the Democrats, quite frankly, is so far away from the priorities of the average Ohio voter.\u201d\n\nOhio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper also disagrees with national strategists\u2019 assessment of Ohio\u2019s declining importance. He makes the case instead for the strategic value of forcing Trump to play defense in a state he won in 2016 by 8 percentage points.\n\nOhio, he adds, is less red than it was in 2006 and 2008, and Democrats are making inroads among female voters. Quinnipiac\u2019s July poll of Ohio voters found 54% of women had an unfavorable view of the President\u2019s handling of the job and just 41% approved of it. In 2016, Trump carried 46% of the female vote, which was more than half of all votes in Ohio. He has scant room for eroding support. Among independents, the same poll found trouble for the President\u2019s re-election: 58% of them disapprove of Trump\u2019s job performance.\n\nPepper also looks to Democratic gains in Ohio\u2019s wealthy suburbs, which were once GOP safeguards against its deep-blue cities. He points for example at Westerville, Ohio, the site of the Oct. 15 Democratic debate, where Democrats have enjoyed a seven-percentage point swing since 2010, and Hudson, a similar suburban enclave near Cleveland, which has seen a nine-point swing toward Dems.\n\n\u201cThe margins they used to run in the suburbs were very important to their overall coalition. It really changes the path,\u201d Pepper tells TIME. \u201cThey\u2019re really only relying on rural Ohio. At some point you run out of runways. They need the suburbs to offset our margins in the cities.\u201d\n\nPepper also cites ever-larger Democratic vote totals. Although victories haven\u2019t followed the numbers, the Democratic turnout is there. In 2018, Democrats carried 48% of congressional votes and 49% of the vote in state legislative races. This would suggest the state is very much in play, he says\u2014especially if Trump continues to be dogged by impeachment inquiries. \u201cWe are more blue than we were in a year Obama won, if you look at 2012,\u201d Pepper says.\n\nTimken, the Ohio Republican chair, acknowledges that President Trump\u2019s declining popularity, but argues that the Republican base will continue to support him when faced with a tangible alternative. \u201cThey may not love the President but he\u2019s delivering for them,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a binary choice.\u201d\n\nIf anything, Trump\u2019s foundering popularity among voters has supercharged his focus on his base\u2014including Trump-loyalists in Ohio. The President\u2019s re-election advisers says he will focus on re-creating the fervor of 2016, visit Ohio regularly and spend campaign cash securing the state. Among states without a Trump golf club, Ohio is the top destination for Air Force One. Ohio is the fourth highest digital spend for the President\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nPepper, the Democratic state chair, says the President\u2019s strategy could go either way. \u201cHis digital stuff worries me,\u201d Pepper acknowledges, but adds that the spending is a major drain on Trump\u2019s resources. \u201cIf we have him fully engaged here, we just won Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. We just did the hard work making Trump fight here,\u201d he says.\n\nFor some Ohio Democrats, Hillary Clinton\u2019s last race is something of a cautionary tale. In 2016, she largely wrote off the state, going more than a month without a visit after Labor Day. She instead emphasized growing demographics in North Carolina, Colorado and Florida.\n\nBut for now, national campaigns continue to view the state as less vital than it once was. It\u2019s perhaps telling that on Oct. 12, when the Ohio Democratic Party hosted its major fundraising dinner\u2014a typical draw for all of the contenders to pitch donors and activists\u2014none of the top-three polling Democrats showed up. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders all skipped the dinner.\n\nOhio Democrats were not crushed. They\u2019re betting the trio will be back to court them ahead of the state\u2019s March primary. Ohio\u2019s true believers are counting on the long-held norms to take over and the state to again be the first agenda item in strategy sessions. After all, both parties have spent decades preaching to donors that Ohio is a proxy for political fortunes.\n\nWrite to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com.", "description": "As national demographics shift, Ohio's status as a must-win state declines.", "authors": ["Philip Elliott", "Columbus"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/dem-debate-09.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
