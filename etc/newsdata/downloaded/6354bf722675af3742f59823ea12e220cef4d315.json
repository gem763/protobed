With national debt growing at a rapid pace, and a rapidly aging population, there are large concerns over the future of the South Korean economy.\n\nMoon assumed office in 2017 after the impeachment of then-President Park Geun-hye. A known progressive, Moon was elected as part of a movement to remove all traces of Park\u2019s conservative party. Since his election, Moon has been increasingly imposing his policies at an enormous cost to South Koreans.\n\nMoon has lowered the maximum workweek from 68 hours to 52 hours. His administration has also significantly increased South Korea\u2019s minimum wage.\n\nThe result of those policies is that there are fewer jobs and a reduction in monthly income for many workers. That\u2019s especially true for young South Koreans looking to enter the workforce.\n\nBusinesses are now less willing to hire and have become selective in the hiring process, given that low-wage employment has become arbitrarily more expensive.\n\nThe youth unemployment rate in May was 9.9%, higher than it was two years ago, when Moon was inaugurated. If you include job seekers and part-time employment, the expanded unemployment rate for youth in South Korea jumps to 23%.\n\nUnable to find work, many students are opting to prolong their education\u2014a cost that doesn\u2019t always pay off. Some are even looking for jobs abroad in China and Japan.\n\nThe cap on workable hours and fewer jobs from an increased minimum wage have also led to a fall in disposable income for the poorest in South Korea, which includes many young adults.\n\nWhile recent reports show that South Korea\u2019s overall unemployment is at a four-year low, that can be misleading as the reduction in unemployment has primarily come from those over the age of 64 looking to re-enter the workforce.\n\nMoon\u2019s policies are only exacerbating an already weak South Korean economy.\n\nHistorically, South Korea is an economy that\u2019s heavily reliant on the export of its manufactured goods. However, manufacturing jobs (a sector already heavily staffed by young workers) and production have been on a steady decline since 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, government debt has risen to $596 billion, at a rate faster than any previous administration, due to increased government spending on economic-stimulus efforts. Of course, that debt will eventually have to be paid by today\u2019s youth\u2014who can\u2019t find work\u2014in the form of higher taxes in the future.\n\nThat creates real concerns for the next generation of South Korea\u2019s workforce and the overall health of the northeast Asian nation\u2019s economy.\n\nThe Index of Economic Freedom, an annual report by The Heritage Foundation, measures the economic freedom of every country based on 12 factors. A reduction in those freedoms could mean a reduction in South Korea\u2019s economic prosperity.\n\nWhile over the past five years, South Korea\u2019s economy has been mostly free, since 2017, there has been a decline in its overall economic-freedom score. According to the report, labor freedom and government integrity in South Korea are seen as mostly unfree. And government spending is becoming more of a problem.\n\nThe South Korean economy is facing great danger due to these illiberal economic policies, and the nation\u2019s young people are bearing the brunt of it.", "description": "The progressive policies of South Korean President Moon Jae-in are a threat to his nation\u2019s economy.\u00a0\n\nYoung people in South Korea are suffering most from those policies as youth\u00a0unemployment continues to rise.\u00a0With\u00a0national debt growing\u00a0at a rapid pace, and a rapidly aging population, there are\u00a0large concerns\u00a0over the future of the South Korean economy.", "authors": ["Riley Walters", "Commentary By", "Policy Analyst", "Asia Economy", "Fall Member Of The Young Leaders Program At The Heritage Foundation"], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-10/GettyImages-833194112.jpg?itok=gxB_85QA", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
