Was it to cover up for \u2018Alabama\u2019 Twitter flub?", "language": "en", "text": "On Wednesday, it appears the White House attempted to retroactively justify a tweet that President Trump issued over the weekend in which he warned, erroneously, that Alabama would be affected by Hurricane Dorian.\n\nIn a White House video released Wednesday, Trump displays a modified National Hurricane Center \u201ccone of uncertainty\u201d forecast, dated from 11 a.m. on Aug. 29, indicating Alabama would in fact be affected. The graphic appears to have been altered with a Sharpie to indicate a risk the storm would move into Alabama from Florida.\n\n\u201cWe had, actually, our original chart was that it was going to be hit \u2014 hitting Florida directly,\u201d Trump said as he displayed the graphic from Aug. 29, which now includes an added appendage extending the cone into Alabama. \u201cThat was the original chart,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt could\u2019ve, uh, was going towards the gulf,\u201d Trump explained in the video.\n\nAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx \u2014 NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019\n\nAsked about the altered hurricane forecast chart at a White House event on opioids Wednesday afternoon, Trump said his briefings included a \u201c95 percent chance probability\u201d that Alabama would be hit. When asked whether the chart had been drawn on, Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t know; I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary J. Hogan Gidley later confirmed that the drawing was made using a black Sharpie, while criticizing the media for focusing on it.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet on Sunday came as Dorian was hitting the Bahamas as a high-end Category 5 hurricane, and the tweet sparked enough public alarm that it prompted the National Weather Service in Birmingham, Ala., to bluntly tweet 20 minutes later: \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe actual National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast map President Trump was shown in a briefing on Hurricane Dorian on Aug. 29. (White House via Flickr)\n\nPhotos posted on the White House\u2019s Flickr site reveal that Trump did receive the correct briefing on Aug. 29 from acting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration head Neil Jacobs, in which the National Hurricane Center\u2019s forecast called for Dorian to hit Florida. Alabama was never included in any National Hurricane Center forecast cone for Dorian, though it was included for a time in a map on the probability of tropical storm conditions, but that showed a low likelihood of that outcome.\n\n\n\nA comparison shows the original Cone of Uncertainty graphic on Aug. 29 and the one shown in the White House video on Sept. 4. (NOAA/White House)\n\nIt is not clear whether Trump was responsible for altering the forecast chart, but the modified photo appeared to show Alabama in Dorian\u2019s eventual line of fire. The original forecast by the National Hurricane Center can be seen here. The National Hurricane Center\u2019s text bulletin at that time included Florida in its discussion five times, but it did not mention Alabama. Instead, the center urged caution from residents in \u201cthe Bahamas, Florida, and elsewhere in the southeastern United States.\u201d\n\n[Hurricane Dorian, one of the Atlantic\u2019s most intense storms on record, baffles the president]\n\nWhen Trump tweeted his original warning to Alabama, the concurrent National Hurricane Center forecast called for Dorian to pass off the Georgia coast, with the center of Dorian\u2019s expected track passing 300 miles east of the Alabama border. The far western extent of the cone was located more than 150 miles east of the Alabama border.\n\nNOAA did not immediately respond to a request for a statement about the altered forecast map, which has the agency\u2019s official logo.\n\nThe White House did not reply requests for comment for this report.\n\nIn a Wednesday evening tweet, Trump defended his Alabama warning and use of the altered map by pointing to raw computer model data provided to state and local governments on Aug. 28, a day before his storm briefing with NOAA and four days before his Alabama tweet.\n\nThe data shows the majority of models called for Hurricane Dorian to make landfall well southeast of Alabama, most likely in Florida. By the time of his controversial tweet on Sunday, the projections on that map showing potential impacts on Alabama had long been ruled out. He doubled down on that defense on Thursday morning, retweeting the Aug. 28 model plot and stating: \u201cAlabama was going to be hit or grazed, and then Hurricane Dorian took a different path (up along the East Coast). The Fake News knows this very well. That\u2019s why they\u2019re the Fake News!\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Trump continued to focus on the Alabama threat, pitting himself against the media as well as meteorologists. Trump tweeted a NOAA chart from August 29 that depicted the likelihood and timing that Alabama would see tropical storm force winds.\n\nThe map indicated only a five to 20 percent chance of such conditions in southeastern Alabama beginning on Monday. However, by the time of President Trump\u2019s tweet on Sept. 1, those odds were down to a 5 percent chance of tropical storm conditions in a sliver of extreme southeastern Alabama on Tuesday night, far below Trump\u2019s figure of 95 percent.\n\nThe White House released a statement Thursday afternoon that cites the possibility of tropical storm force winds in a portion of Alabama to justify Trump\u2019s tweets and public statements on the topic.\n\nAltering official government weather forecasts isn\u2019t just a cause for concern \u2014 it\u2019s illegal. Per 18 U.S. Code 2074, which addresses false weather reports: \u201cWhoever knowingly issues or publishes any counterfeit weather forecast or warning of weather conditions falsely representing such forecast or warning to have been issued or published by the Weather Bureau, United States Signal Service, or other branch of the Government service, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ninety days, or both.\u201d\n\nThat law applies to what is now known as NOAA\u2019s National Weather Service, which contains the National Hurricane Center.", "description": "Trump had erroneously stated last week that Hurricane Dorian threatened Alabama.", "authors": ["Matthew Cappucci", "Meteorologist", "Capital Weather Gang", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "Matthew Cappucci Is A Meteorologist For Capital Weather Gang.
