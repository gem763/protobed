Rouhani did not say who Tehran believed the culprit was but did note that it looked like the party behind the attack was a government rather than a terrorist group.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a terrorist move, nor was it carried out by an individual. It was carried out by a government,\u201d Rouhani told media.\n\nIranian tanker Sabiti was attacked on Friday, off the Saudi coast near the port of Jeddah. The Saudi coast guard confirmed yesterday that the vessel had sent a distress signal, via email since its geolocation was switched off. The signal said the tanker had suffered damage in the front and that oil was leaking from it.\n\nInitial reports in the Iranian media blamed the attack on Saudi Arabia, but later the National Iranian Tanker Company, which confirmed the attack, said there was no evidence pointing towards any one particular country. The only suggestion a NITC official made was that the missiles that are believed to have been used to strike the tanker may have \u201cpossibly\u201d been fired from Saudi soil.\n\nRelated: Buffett\u2019s Big Bet On Energy\n\nRouhani first warned there will be a response to the tanker attack on Sunday. That was the first time he referred to the culprit as a country: \u201cIf a country thinks that it can create instability in the region without getting a response, that would be a sheer mistake.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia was quick to deny any blame.\n\n\u201cWe did not engage in such behaviour at all. This is not how we operate and that\u2019s not how we did (it) in the past,\u201d Saudi Arabia\u2019s foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, told media.\n\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oillprice.com:\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "description": "Though details of Friday\u2019s tanker attack have not yet been confirmed, Iran has made it clear that it plans to retaliate against the responsible party", "authors": ["Irina Slav"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
