Make a plan\n\nWhat are the 10 cooking staples Jessica always has on hand? Chilli flakes Lemons Garlic Curry powder Tahini Extra virgin olive oil Dijon mustard Tamari Sesame seeds Sea salt\n\nMost importantly, Jessica said a plan is key.\n\nBefore you even visit the supermarket, sit down and plan out what you intend to eat for the week - and the items you need to buy to prepare these meals.\n\n'Buying only what you truly need is not only helpful when it comes to budgeting but also eliminates waste,' Jessica said.\n\nShe recommends downloading the JSHealth app for inspiration with meal planning and shopping lists.\n\n2. Check out the online specials\n\nBefore she does her weekly shop, Jessica said she'll always check the weekly specials by heading online to the big retailers' websites.\n\nThat way, she said, you can take these into account when you're planning out your meals.\n\nA seasonal shop is a healthy one, but it's not just good for your waistline - it will save you precious dollars, too - Jessica (pictured) recommends you check out what's in season\n\n3. Shop seasonally\n\nA seasonal shop is a healthy one, but it's not just good for your waistline - it will save you precious dollars, too.\n\n'A quick Google search will help you find out what is in season for your personal location,' Jessica said.\n\nThis seasonal produce guide is a good place to start.\n\nWhen you get to the supermarket, Jessica said you should never discount the ugly fruit and vegetables - as this doesn't mean they don't boast the same nutrients (pictured)\n\n4. Don't be turned off by the ugly produce\n\nWhen you get to the supermarket, Jessica said you should never discount the ugly fruit and vegetables - as this doesn't mean they don't boast the same nutrients.\n\n'Rather than turn your nose up at a carrot with a few extra growths, pop these guys in your trolley instead,' she said.\n\n'They are often half the price and it's a great initiative to eliminate waste and support farmers.'\n\n5. Buy in bulk\n\nBuying in bulk is a great way of ensuring you're healthy and well within budget.\n\nJessica said grains, meat, rice and flours are all great foods to buy in larger sizes.\n\n'When you get home, slice your meat into portions yourself, pop what you are going to use in the fridge for the week and store the rest in the freezer,' she said.\n\nKeep an eye out for when your favourite items are on sale for when you stock up.\n\n6. Add plant-based protein\n\nMeat isn't the only form of protein you should look for.\n\nJessica said plant-based protein is wallet-friendly and healthy.\n\nHer favourites are tinned beans and lentils, which she'll whip into salads and Mediterranean-inspired dishes.\n\n7. Try frozen fruit and veg\n\nJust because you're shopping healthily, it doesn't mean you have to buy everything fresh.\n\nJessica revealed snap-frozen fruit and veg are great for just throwing together a quick meal, and often they retain a larger percentage of their nutrient content than fresh.\n\n'These are generally cheaper and won't spoil,' Jessica said.\n\nHer favourites are frozen spinach, blueberries, broccoli and sugar-snap peas.\n\n8. Check your local farmers' market\n\nIf you're lucky enough to live close to a farmers' market, Jessica said these in fact go a long way to keeping costs down.\n\nShe recommends you head there just before the markets close, when you'll find prices are often reduced even further.\n\n'Each suburb or community will often have a fruit/veggie co-op or delivery service. The only downside of this is you often don\u2019t get to choose what you get,' Jessica (pictured) said\n\n9. Research local fruit and veg co-op options\n\n'Each suburb or community will often have a fruit/veggie co-op or delivery service. The only downside of this is you often don\u2019t get to choose what you get,' Jessica said.\n\nThe positive is that you will constantly be being exposed to new flavours and food items, meaning your tastebuds never get bored.\n\n10. Try ordering your groceries online\n\nLast but not least, Jessica said you should do an online shop to save you time and money.\n\nShe said this can help with a budget, as you can see how much everything is costing, before you get to the checkout.", "description": "Sydney-based nutritionist Jessica Sepel has revealed her supermarket tricks for shopping on a budget - and the ten pantry staples she always has on hand.", "authors": ["Sophie Haslett For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/02/19865970-0-image-a-16_1571362247279.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
