Viktualienmarkt beer garden. Photo: Nikada/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s commonly understood that the best way to explore a new place is to go straight to the locals. Each week in the Urbanist, we take that wisdom one step further by seeking out not just locals but local experts \u2014 those who are especially well versed in their cities\u2019 newest and most noteworthy scenes \u2014 to give us insider recommendations. This week, we asked brewer Thomas Girg, owner of the Haderner Br\u00e4u M\u00fcnchen, for his picks in Bavaria\u2019s capital city.\n\n\u201cPeople in Munich don\u2019t just wear lederhosen and dirndls because there\u2019s a carnival or whatever. The people live this tradition. They live Bavaria, they talk Bavarian. Throughout the year, there are many small festivals and other beer festivals in Munich and Bavaria. This is the real Munich. Oktoberfest is more for the world. I absolutely recommend going to Auer Dult (Mariahilfplatz); it\u2019s a mixture of a traditional festival and market that happens three times a year, including two weeks after Oktoberfest. There you can have a beer and walk through stalls selling rare books, handmade soaps, and wooden goods. During the summer months, almost every district has its own street festival. Especially popular is the great Streetlife Festival on the Leopoldstra\u00dfe but also the Hans-Sachs-Stra\u00dfenfest or Ois Giesing. The time just before Christmas is something: the many small Christmas markets, the people of Munich really love those. The best known is the one on Marienplatz, but just around the corner, at the Viktualienmarkt, a small but colorful Christmas market called Winterzauber takes place. Here you have delicious homemade cheese or warm gl\u00fchwein (mulled wine) or gl\u00fchbier (mulled beer). We make one ourselves with our dark organic beer, cherry juice, rum, and many Christmas spices.\u201d\n\nThe Christmas market on the Marienplatz.

But there are also many family-run houses, usually a bit out of town. I especially like the Schlossgut Oberambach (Oberambach 1) on Lake Starnberg, which is about 30 kilometers south of Munich and under an hour from the city with the rapid-transit railway or over the Autobahn A95. The house has about 40 rooms and is in a secluded location with a 50-hectare forest and meadows around. The onsite Restaurant Roseninsel has a very good breakfast. It\u2019s an ecohotel, so almost everything is organic (except the fish and venison), and there are plenty of vegetarian and vegan dishes. The \u2018superior\u2019 rooms in the historical castle part of the estate have views of the Alps, and there\u2019s an adjoining newer building with rooms decorated in a French-country-house style.\u201d\n\nR e s t a u r a n t s B\u00fcffelhof Beuerbach. Photo: B\u00fcffelhof Beuerbach/Facebook \u201cFrischeParadies (Zenettistra\u00dfe 10e) is a specialty food shop. There\u2019s no better place in Munich to get fresh food. It\u2019s actually an Italian-style deli, market, and bistro in one; you can see the kitchen in the middle of it. They have really fresh fish and really nice wine. I usually get the fish platter \u2014 the type of fish changes daily depending on what\u2019s available. It\u2019s really amazing. It\u2019s served with vegetables and wild-herb salad. They also have our Haderner Br\u00e4u organic beers on tap. A little further out in the country there\u2019s B\u00fcffelhof Beuerbach (Benediktstra\u00dfe 4). It\u2019s a buffalo farm, and the restaurant is run by four top chefs who make great dishes from everything buffalo: buffalo meat, buffalo milk, buffalo butter. My favorite dish is their baked buffalo schnitzel with cranberries, horseradish, and potatoes. It has a fabulous taste, different from any other schnitzel you had before. It\u2019s a really special place. You can walk through the farm and see the buffalos.\u201d\n\nB a v a r i a n F o o d Ratskellar. Photo: Ratskellar/Facebook; \u00a9CarolineMartinPhotographer.

The Haderner Augustiner (W\u00fcrmtalstra\u00dfe 113) is just around the corner from our brewery. It\u2019s really Bavarian, so you have schweinshaxe, which is pork leg. You get a great pork roast; it has a really crunchy crust. They have a nice beer garden, too, and the building is almost 300 years old. It\u2019s one of the first breweries in Munich. If you stay in Munich, you have to visit Ratskeller (Marienplatz 8). It\u2019s very good Bavarian cuisine. Both places have typical Bavarian styles inside, lots of wood: wood floors, wood paneling, wood chairs. But Ratskeller is more Gothic with stained glass and painted vaulted ceilings.\u201d\n\nB r e w e r i e s a n d B e e r H a l l s Tilmans brewery and bar. Photo: Courtesy of Tilmans Biere \u201cMunich is a beer city. At our small, family-run brewery, Haderner Br\u00e4u M\u00fcnchen (Gro\u00dfhaderner Str. 16) in Hadern, most of the beers we produce are traditional ones, like the dunkels, the popular dark Munich beer, or a hefeweizen or a lager. In the past, only dark beer was brewed in Munich. Our most popular beer is the natural, cloudy helles lager. It\u2019s very tasty and only slightly hopped. Augustiner-Br\u00e4u (Landsberger Str. 31-35) is the oldest brewery in Munich. The building was an old monastery, and they have a really nice beer garden. The biggest breweries here, like Augustiner and Hofbr\u00e4uhaus, have similar beers on tap because they are serving the crowds. But I like the smaller beer halls, like Tilmans Biere (Thalkirchner Str. 53), Giesinger Br\u00e4ust\u00fcberl (Martin-Luther-Stra\u00dfe 2), and Crew Republic (Andreas-Danzer-Weg 30), where you can drink craft beers: IPA, stout, and so on. At Tilmans, try the oyster stout, which has impressions of roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee.\u201d\n\nF l e a M a r k e t s Hofflohm\u00e4rkte outside people's homes or inside their gardens.

Almost every week, there\u2019s a flea market in one of neighborhoods. At some, you can buy everything from clothes to chairs, and some have old historical goods. Then there are others that take place outside people\u2019s homes, called Hofflohm\u00e4rkte. You can go from house to house \u2014 people will open their garden gates or garages \u2014 and you can find many beautiful treasures. The Hadern borough really started this trend, but you find these all over Munich, and you can find out where these garden and yard markets are happening here.\u201d\n\nM u s e u m s a n d A t t r a c t i o n s Clockwise from the top: Deutsches Museum, Olympiaturm, and BMW Welt.

It\u2019s in the city center and for all ages. They have exhibits about planes, animals, the first moon walk, everything. Art lovers should go to Pinakothek der Moderne (Barer Str. 40) as well as the Alte Pinakothek and Neue Pinakothek (Barer Str. 27). Together they have one of Europe\u2019s best collections of fine art. And Museum Brandhorst (Theresienstra\u00dfe 35a), which focuses on contemporary art, has more works by Andy Warhol than anywhere in Europe. At the Olympiaturm, or Olympic Tower, in the Olympic Park, you can dine in the restaurant at the top. The whole space turns, so you can see all of Munich as you sit there. It also has a wonderful view of the Zugspitze, which is the highest peak of the Wetterstein Mountains. Afterward, visit the BMW Welt (Am Olympiapark 1) \u2014 Munich is the headquarters of BMW \u2014 which traces its history back to its first motorbike.\u201d\n\nD a y T r i p Lake Starnberg (left) and Zugspitze.

Half of the mountain is on the Austrian side, but the highest point is on the German side. It\u2019s almost 3,000 meters. You can hike and climb around there and take the cable car or lift to the peak. It\u2019s a big ski area. You can also paddle on Lake Starnberg, about 20 minutes by car outside of Munich. Germans love to go there in the summertime and stand-up paddleboard, which is really big in Germany right now. It\u2019s unbelievable, they\u2019ve already started to limit the number of people who can do it at some Bavarian lakes.\u201d", "description": "For a local\u2019s guide to Munich, Germany, we asked brewer Thomas Girg, owner of the Haderner Br\u00e4u M\u00fcnchen, for his picks in Bavaria\u2019s capital city, including beer festivals that aren\u2019t Oktoberfest, craft-beer halls, the best Christmas market, and more.", "authors": ["Trupti Rami"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/urbanist/2019/09/munich/viktualienmarkt-beer-garden.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
