As vice president of communications, he has overseen internal and external messaging, striving to keep Apple\u2019s product plans secret and preserve its brand reputation as a leading tech company.\n\nApple marketing chief Phil Schiller will oversee the communications team on an interim basis, the company said. Dowling told staff of his decision in a memo, saying he had decided to step away from his role and would help with the transition through next month. He plans to spend more time with his family, he said.\n\nDowling\u2019s planned departure comes at a time of transition for Apple AAPL, +0.94% , which is trying to make itself more of a services and entertainment company as sales of its iPhone and other devices have stalled in recent years. The company also has lost several high-level executives this year, most notably design chief Jony Ive, who said in June he would leave the company. That came two months after the departure of retail chief Angela Ahrendts.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\n\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\n\n\u2018This is not the way everybody behaves.\u2019 How Adam Newmann\u2019s over-the-top style built WeWork.\n\nU.S., Saudi military forces failed to detect attack on oil facilities.", "description": "Apple Inc. said Wednesday its head of communications was leaving the company, the latest of several senior executive departures this year as the tech giant...", "authors": ["Tripp Mickle"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GH034_appleh_ZG_20180409174825.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
