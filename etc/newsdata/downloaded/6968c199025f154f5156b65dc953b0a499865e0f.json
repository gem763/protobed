We don\u2019t plot, governments make decisions.\n\n\u201cWe went up with British Airways, the three relevant ministers - me, the leader of the House of Lords and the government chief whip.\n\n\u201cAnd we had a fantastic journey from Aberdeen airport to Balmoral because we travelled with the Queen\u2019s hairdresser - I hope it\u2019s not too indiscreet to tell you that, who was absolutely charming and full of fascinating stories, which I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d\n\nRees-Mogg was asked if he worried he was a proxy for misleading the Queen over prorogation. He replied: \u201cOh what nonsense, no, absolute nonsense.\u201d\n\nHe labelled Nigel Farage a \u201cvery distinguished political figure\u201d a \u201csignificant British statesman\u201d but would not be drawn on whether he should receive a knighthood or a peerage.\n\nRees-Mogg was also asked if there was a way back for the 21 MPs who lost the Tory whip earlier this month. He replied: \u201cI think that it is human to err, it is divine to forgive and the prime minister is very close to being divine I think.\u201d\n\nHe also expressed regret at his decision to recline on the front bench while listening to a key Brexit debate. Rees-Mogg said he was \u201csimply sitting comfortably\u201d, adding: \u201cI do accept it was a mistake.\u201d", "description": "Sir John Major\u00a0has compared\u00a0Boris Johnson\u00a0to a dishonest estate agent in his written submission to the Supreme Court on the final day of the hearing over prorogation.
