The research firm stated that the total market forecast is expected to grow 2.6 percent annually through 2023 and that influencers will be vital in capturing the future generation of dieters.\n\nThe following five celebs have played an influential role in weight loss programs and fitness revolutions throughout the years:\n\nKhloe Kardashian\n\nBefore she was sculpting bodies on reality TV, Khloe Kardashian was briefly a spokesperson for the diet supplement line QuickTrim. The defunct company reportedly generated $45 million in revenue after it inked a deal with New Jersey-based Windmill Health Products in 2009, however, a $5 million class action lawsuit over false advertising tarnished the brand.\n\nIn 2017, Khloe starred in her solo reality TV series, \u201cRevenge Body,\u201d which aired on E! Entertainment. The show follows the starlet guiding participants through a weight loss challenge. Each episode ends with a dramatic makeover reveal and a celebration of each person\u2019s trimmed down figures \u2013 which serves as a symbolic representation of \u201crevenge\u201d against anyone who spoke badly about their previous form. The show has had three seasons so far.\n\nKhloe has also been a social media influencer for controversial detox brand Flat Tummy Tea, which earned her criticism in March from actress Jameela Jamil.\n\nKirstie Alley\n\nActress Kirstie Alley has been very open with the public about her weight loss struggles. From 2005 to 2008, she was the spokesmodel for weight management program and nutrition company Jenny Craig, Inc. While she was with the company, she lost over 75 pounds and maintained that weight for more than a year before she stepped down from the position.\n\nShortly after leaving Jenny Craig, Kirstie ventured out on her own with a weight loss elixir called Rescue Me, which was designed to curb hunger. By July 2012, the former \u201cCheers\u201d starlet was involved in a class action lawsuit that alleged her business used false claims about her self-proclaimed hundred-pound weight loss.\n\nA few years later, Kirstie admitted she gained the weight back and aimed to lose 80 pounds to wear a bikini again. In 2014, Kirstie joined Jenny Craig as a spokesmodel once more to get back her body and confidence, according to a report from People.\n\nMarie Osmond\n\nSinger and actress Marie Osmond has been an ongoing success story for weight loss program Nutrisystem, which she joined as spokesmodel in 2008. She lost 50 pounds while following its diet and fitness plans and has maintained her weight for over a decade.\n\nHer partnership with the brand eventually evolved from print advertisements to TV commercials, campaigns and infomercial hosting segments.\n\n\u201cTwelve years ago, I made it my goal to take better care of my body so I could live longer and better serve my children; it helped me SEE more clearly the beauty in each day,\u201d Marie wrote in an Instagram post earlier this year. \u201cIt gave me a clearer desire and the energy to serve and spread this message of joy as much as I possibly can!\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nOprah Winfrey\n\nTalk show host and media mogul Oprah Winfrey opened up viewers about her weight loss struggles originally in the 1980s back when she starred on \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show.\u201d She started her dabble in wellness with a publicized liquid diet using Optifast. She lost 67 pounds using this lineup of drinks and celebrated the achievement with an unforgettable episode where she wheeled in a wagon full of fat.\n\nFrom that TV moment on, Oprah\u2019s weight has yo-yoed. However, she partnered with Weight Watchers in 2015 and appeared in a commercial where she declared her love for bread. In her testimony, the Weight Watchers program has helped her eat healthier food without feeling deprived. Aside from losing over 40 pounds while following the company\u2019s dietary and fitness plans, Oprah has given Weight Watchers a stock boost and has even bought a stake in the business.\n\nOprah is going on tour with Weight Watchers in 2020, which is said to have an overall focus in healthy living rather than obsessing over a number on the scale. The venture is a nine-city tour that kicks off in the beginning of the year.\n\nRob Lowe\n\nActor, producer and director Rob Lowe became the face of the low-carb weight loss program Atkins Nutritionals, Inc. in 2018. Or as the brand likes to put it, \u201cAtkins Has Gone \u201cLowe Carb.\u201d The diet emphasizes eating protein and healthy fats.\n\n\"Having a healthy lifestyle and trying to eat well has been a natural part of my life for a long, long time,\" Rob told INSIDER regarding his decision to join the weight loss company. \"So when [Atkins] asked me to partner with them to help remind people that it was a lifestyle, not necessarily a diet, it was a really good fit. That's what I've been doing anyway.\"\n\nIn a separate 25-second advert shared this summer, Rob tells audiences that Atkins is Keto compliant due to its low-carb, high-fat philosophy \u2013 which may be the brands way to remain competitive in the crowded weight loss market.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Adele flaunted her newfound dedication to wellness on social media.
