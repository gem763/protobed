These investments have been funded by Best Buy's core consumer electronics retail business and investments in services.\n\nBest Buy\n\nCEO Corie Barry unveiled Best Buy's next phase of its strategy called Building the New Blue: Chapter Two. Barry noted that Best Buy has hit its previous targets ahead of schedule and now is targeting revenue of $50 billion in fiscal 2025 with $1 billion of cost savings and a non-GAAP operating income rate of 5%.\n\nBarry said Best Buy's \"strategy is working\" and the company's goal is to expand with its services footprint as well as continued innovation in the tech space.\n\nBest Buy's goal for fiscal 2025 is to double what it calls significant customer relationship events to 50 million. Barry said the a commitment to the customer for tech support, homes visited, consultation, active digital engagement and senior lives supported.\n\n\"Our deep understanding of the customer is only matched by our unique ability to meet their needs,\" said Barry.\n\nBest Buy's Barry noted that the traditional consumer electronics category is at least as stable as other durable good categories. That relative stability combined with tech innovation and new devices will give Best Buy good footing to expand into new markets. \"One of the reasons the CE category continues to grow is because of tech innovation,\" said Barry.\n\nTechnologies such as digital health, 5G, foldable phones, 8K TVs are all growth areas. Barry said that Best Buy is uniquely suited to combine tech and high-touch customer service. Indeed, Best Buy has invested in analytics, marketing, people and partnerships with key vendors such as Amazon, Samsung, Apple and Microsoft.\n\nPerhaps the biggest takeaway is how Best Buy is planning to sell technology as well as services to make integration less complex. With that approach, Best Buy can advance into adjacent categories such as healthcare.\n\nHere are slides outlining Best Buy's healthcare progression.\n\nSpecial Feature The NHS and technology: How innovation is revolutionizing healthcare (free PDF) AI and robots, IoT, virtual and augmented reality, and wearables\u2014all are innovative technologies that could boost healthcare and productivity across the NHS. This ebook looks at how these technologies are being implemented and their current and future impact on health services.

There are also free services and partnerships to deliver Apple Care repairs. \"The goal of services we provide is to strengthen our customer relationships,\" said Barry. \"We aim to be the CTO of your daily life.\"\n\nBarry said Best Buy's orientation around tech and the culture can move it into healthcare where today it primarily sells devices. Best Buy's acquisition of Great Call last year started a healthcare push.\n\nAsheesh Saksena, president of Best Buy Health, outlined how the retailer is entering the healthcare market. Saksena outlined how the first step in Best Buy's health strategy revolves around bringing health tech to market and helping consumers navigate the landscape.\n\nFrom there, Best Buy wants to scale its remote monitoring tools and ultimately add care coordination services as a benefit within health insurance plans.\n\nBest Buy will have to move beyond being an omnichannel retailer to one that revolves around services. The healthcare industry is moving toward Best Buy's sweet spot. Consider:\n\nTechnology is making the home a node in healthcare delivery.\n\nThe population is aging and two out of three seniors live with two or more chronic conditions.\n\nThere will be 54 million seniors in 2023 and 90% of them want to stay at home.\n\nPayments are tied to value delivered and in-home services play into improving outcomes.\n\nConsumers want more control over health matters and care giving.\n\nBest Buy has filled in health technology gaps with acquisitions of Great Call and CST.\n\nToday, Best Buy aims to build out its remote monitoring capabilities via Geek Squad, which installs home technology. Passive monitoring, artificial intelligence and smart home technology can all improve healthcare outcomes.\n\nWith remote monitoring, there's an avenue for Best Buy to serve Medicare users to aid frail seniors. Best Buy is betting it can deliver savings for insurers serving frail seniors for a monthly fee per person. As for home health services, Best Buy also sees a role via its CST unit.\n\nBest Buy executives noted that the company will have to operate differently as it builds out services and drives its retail business with automation, e-commerce, analytics and fulfillment improvements.", "description": "Best Buy is already aiming to be the CTO of your home and now it is aiming to grab a slice of the digital healthcare market via remote monitoring, services and integration with insurers.", "authors": ["Larry Dignan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/25/2b17c43e-305e-4a6f-879f-d129f03b4371/thumbnail/770x578/2ec38e0437e5f458475a3b38d41340d3/best-buy-barry.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
