As long as Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is running the Senate, major Democratic proposals are going nowhere; his power as majority leader\u2014and a filibuster rule that requires 60 votes for most legislation\u2014makes the chances of success unlikely. As the 2020 primary cranked up to its next level of seriousness with the third debate last night, so did that big question for the Democrats onstage: How exactly are they going to do what they\u2019ve proposed?\n\nMost of the candidates said they were eager for a detailed discussion. Yet none were ready to embrace the challenge entirely. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, for example, tried to avoid directly answering a question about whether middle-class taxes would go up under Medicare for All\u2014even though Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose plan she\u2019s endorsed, acknowledges they would. (He\u2019s argued that Americans would save money overall on their health-care costs.) And Warren has still never quite explained how she proposes to pass the 2 percent wealth tax that is at the core of her candidacy. Meanwhile, the moderators wanted to know, what is Joe Biden\u2019s plan to counter China\u2019s economic rise if not the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal he once helped sell but now opposes? How would Sanders get any of his major proposals through the Senate when he still supports keeping the filibuster in place? How would former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas build support in Congress for mandatory assault-rifle buybacks? The answers largely remain mysteries.\n\nEventually the how can catch up to politicians. Consider Republicans\u2019 \u201crepeal and replace\u201d pledge. For years, GOP leaders promised to release a health-care plan that managed to retain all the popular elements of the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans voted dozens of times to roll back the ACA, with Democrats in the Senate ultimately blocking their efforts. In 2017, a repeal push in the upper chamber only failed because of the late Senator John McCain of Arizona and his famous thumbs-down. Yet at no point has a full replacement plan emerged, even as Donald Trump has promised that he\u2019s not done trying to get rid of Obamacare.\n\nSome of the candidates last night rejected getting in the weeds, preferring to campaign in clear, bold swings. \u201cFrankly, I think this discussion has given the American public a headache. What they want to know is that they\u2019re going to have health care and cost will not be a barrier to getting it,\u201d Harris said at one point, trying to short-circuit a long exchange on health care. \u201cThis reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington: scoring points against each other, poking at each other, and telling each other that\u2014my plan, your plan,\u201d South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said a few minutes later, trying to muscle into an exchange between Biden and former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s called the Democratic-primary election, Pete,\u201d Castro fired back. \u201cThat\u2019s called an election.\u201d", "description": "The candidates onstage heard a version of that big question over and over again.", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19255860124543/facebook.jpg?1568383788", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
