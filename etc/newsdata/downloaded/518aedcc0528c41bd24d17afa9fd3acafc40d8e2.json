You will hear from us about our fears over financial collapse,\" he said.\n\n\"Dialogue is always the best for salvation. I am waiting for you.\"\n\nAoun's comments are his first since the protests started on Thursday, but his speech was met with derision at demonstrations in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, and other cities.\n\nDozens of protesters listening to the speech on loudspeakers outside parliament in Beirut booed it and resumed their calls for fundamental reform.\n\nAmong them, Rabah Shahrour said he was fed up with hearing the same speeches for years.\n\n191023153239365\n\n\"We were looking for a little hope from him,\" he told the AFP news agency. \"But sadly the president today spoke in generalities. We've being hearing these generalities for three years, and they haven't led to anything.\"\n\nAl Jazeera's Zeina Khodr, reporting from Beirut, said Aoun's pledges were not enough to sway protesters.\n\n\"The protesters don't trust the people in power. They want a technocrat government, ministers who are not affiliated with the different political parties, who will work in the interests of Lebanon. They also want early elections \u2013 Aoun addressed that.\n\n\"He said if you want change, it has to go through constitutional means, change cannot come from the street. What he means is the next election, the ballot box. So clearly he didn't meet the demands of the protesters but he is reaching out to protesters.\"\n\nCommenting on Aoun's address, Lebanese journalist Jamal Ghosn told Al Jazeera that the president's speech appeared to be a government tactic to try to \"defuse the protests\".\n\n\"They [the Lebanese government] will try to break up the protest by any means possible and they don't seem open to change,\" he explained.\n\nGhosn added that unless the protesters continue to demonstrate, it was unlikely the government will address their concerns.\n\n\"If they [the protesters] have the staima to keep things going [for more than one week] then we might see things change.\n\n\"Another option would be for the protests to escalate and put more pressure [on the state],\" he added.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Michel Aoun says he is ready for dialogue with protesters to find the best solution for Lebanon's economic crisis.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/24/653566ad5b0344d199e20957c9b0e54f_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
