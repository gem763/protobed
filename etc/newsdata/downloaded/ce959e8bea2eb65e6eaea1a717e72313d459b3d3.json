Some fear the splits mean that \u201cthe people claiming to want to stop Brexit may end up being the ones who let it happen\u201d.\n\nThe splits have culminated in a power struggle over control of a future Remain campaign, should a second referendum happen. Many insiders believe senior figures will be dismissed. \u201cIt\u2019s civil war,\u201d said one insider. \u201cIt\u2019s total hell.\u201d\n\nWhile several people said day-to-day relations among staff were happy, disharmony broke out in earnest in the spring. A major disagreement erupted over the March for Change, a pro-Remain rally in London in July. The event, set up by a small group of campaigners wanting to embrace a more explicitly pro-Remain stance, caused outrage among some in the People\u2019s Vote headquarters in Millbank Tower. Opponents regarded it as picking \u201cthe wrong time, the wrong message and the wrong people\u201d.\n\nFrustrations led staff to sign an extraordinary letter. \u201cThis splinter group has confused our supporters, diverted staff attention and resources, disrupted our relationship with our local groups and grassroots activists, as well as seriously damaging morale,\u201d it stated. \u201cGiven the differences in strategy, fundraising and data collection, it is necessary to formalise the separation between us.\n\n\u201cWe hope our views will be listened to and it is understood why it is necessary to make serious and urgent changes to our organisation and governance \u2026 If these matters are not speedily and fully resolved, we fear that a number of our valued colleagues will resign \u2013 potentially derailing the campaign at a crucial point, destroying morale and risking adverse publicity.\u201d\n\nThe letter remains highly contentious. While some claim almost 60 members of staff signed it, others say some signatories were pressured into doing so, while others later retracted their names or had not seen the text. \u201cThere are bound to be differences of emphasis in campaigns,\u201d said one sympathetic official. \u201cSome people decided March for Change was more of an enemy than the Brexiteers.\u201d\n\nCampaign chiefs were also accused of giving too much support to Labour in the European elections, against advice and despite the party\u2019s ambiguous Brexit stance.\n\nHowever, the most recent warring has centred on the decision by Roland Rudd, the PR guru, to form a new company to oversee a potential Remain campaign. Rudd is the outgoing chair of Open Britain, the most powerful group under the People\u2019s Vote umbrella. The new company, called Baybridge, has several Open Britain directors on its board, including the businessman Richard Reed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The March for Change in London in July.

However, allies of Rudd said the company was part of a plan to bring order to the campaign, and that it would have a large board and some directors directly elected from grassroots Remain organisations. They claimed some pro-Remain groups had already signed up.\n\n\u201cThe People\u2019s Vote campaign has done amazingly well, but we can\u2019t rest easy because we still haven\u2019t got there,\u201d said a supporter. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be unified and you do that by all being part of one group.\u201d\n\nOpponents of the Rudd plan said that a rival campaign blueprint, drawn up earlier this year by philanthropist Stephen Dawson, was ready to go and should be pursued. It envisages making Michael Heseltine, the former Tory deputy leader, campaign chair and appointing Labour\u2019s Margaret Beckett and former Tory MP Dominic Grieve as his deputies.\n\nSeveral sources also cited a strategic disagreement, with Rudd wanting to embrace a more pro-Remain position and campaign directors wanting to concentrate on winning over soft Leave voters and wavering Labour and Tory MPs. One figure described Rudd\u2019s group as the \u201cKensington splinter\u201d, adding: \u201cWhatever he says, Rudd at heart doesn\u2019t understand how another referendum has to be won on the streets of Pontefract, rather than over cocktails in Phillimore Gardens [a premium Kensington address].\u201d\n\nA Rudd ally disputed the description: \u201cRoland spends huge amounts of time trying to win over new supporters, but at the same time, it\u2019s just absurd to pretend that many of our grassroots supporters aren\u2019t driven by a desire to reverse this madness. Their concerns shouldn\u2019t dictate the campaign, but they should be respected.\u201d\n\nDespite the clashes, senior officials still believe a second referendum can be achieved. \u201cWe are still very much in the fight,\u201d said one. \u201cWe have come so far and we believe we are close in terms of votes in parliament. And if there\u2019s an election and we run a trusted tactical voting campaign, we\u2019re in business.\u201d", "description": "Row over explicitly pro-Remain \u2018splinter group\u2019 leads some staff to call for formal split", "authors": ["Michael Savage"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b8d097055c2211d923752ab7d62007fbad0d2a0/0_0_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7e6c67537ff229efe1699c0945f3415d", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
