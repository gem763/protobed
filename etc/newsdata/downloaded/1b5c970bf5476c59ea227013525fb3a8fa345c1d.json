We don't know what time they will finish amid uncertainty over the votes.\n\nPeers started their debate at 10:00 and are due to finish at 15:00.\n\nCommons proceedings got under way with a statement from Prime Minister Boris Johnson and a response from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nThe prime minister took questions on his Brexit deal from MPs for nearly two hours - and they are now debating the government motion on it.\n\nImage copyright UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor\n\nWhat time will voting get under way?\n\nIt's likely to begin after 14:30 but the timings have yet to be announced.\n\nThere could be up to four votes - or no votes at all.\n\nCommons Speaker John Bercow has selected two amendments to be voted on by MPs.\n\nThey are:\n\nFormer Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin's proposal to withhold approval for the deal unless and until legislation implementing it is passed\n\nA cross-party amendment rejecting a no-deal Brexit and seeking a second referendum\n\nThe first vote will be on the Letwin amendment, if it is moved.\n\nThis could be followed by a vote on the main government motion - whether or not to back the deal.\n\nThe government does not want this vote to happen if MPs back the Letwin amendment, as it could delay Brexit.\n\nIt is not clear at this stage how they would prevent the vote happening - it's possible Tory MPs could abstain - but the motion has already been tabled.\n\nIf it does take place, and MPs reject the deal, we could then move to votes on a second government motion on whether or not there should be a no-deal Brexit.\n\nBefore a vote takes place on that, MPs could get a chance to vote on the cross-party amendment rejecting a no-deal Brexit and seeking another referendum.\n\nMPs would then vote for a fourth time - on the government no-deal motion. We know there is a majority in the Commons against a no-deal Brexit, so this would be unlikely to pass.\n\nRegardless of what happens on Saturday, the government has said it plans to push ahead with the legislation enacting the treaty agreed by Boris Johnson in Brussels - the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.\n\nThey plan to hold the second reading of that bill on Tuesday, which would give MPs a chance to register their support - or not - for Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.\n\nWhat happens if MPs vote for the deal?\n\nIf the government motion is passed by MPs without being amended, it will just be the first stage of getting the deal into law.\n\nThe government is likely to want to move quickly so it can meet Boris Johnson's 31 October deadline.\n\nThe Withdrawal Amendment Bill, which implements the legally-binding treaty, will be presented to Parliament early next week - something the government now plans to do whatever happens in Parliament on Saturday.\n\nHow can you follow the debate?\n\nYou can find out the latest developments on the BBC News website and app, where we'll have live coverage in text and video, and analysis from our experts.\n\nThere will also be coverage on BBC One from 09:00 to 13:15, BBC Two from 13:15 to 16:30, and continuous coverage on the BBC News Channel.\n\nThere will also be extended editions of BBC News at Six and News at Ten, as well as a special edition of BBC Newsnight.\n\nWhy is the Letwin amendment significant?\n\nImage caption Oliver Letwin does not support a no-deal Brexit\n\nBy the BBC's Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy\n\nThe government seems to be all but conceding that the Letwin amendment will pass, and is making its dispositions accordingly - announcing plans to hold a \"meaningful vote\" on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill on Tuesday.\n\nThis would corner MPs into a Yes/No vote on their deal, and given there are a fair number of Labour rebels, the government could well win.\n\nCertainly, the vote would put any number of Labour MPs - and MPs for other parties - from Brexit-voting constituencies in a very awkward place.\n\nWatch out for an attempt to attach a second referendum to the deal in some way.\n\nBut the success of that effort would require full-throated support (and whipping of their MPs) from the Labour Party. They are not there yet, and they may never be.\n\nIf the government wins a \"meaningful vote\" on Tuesday, the legislation to underpin the new deal would then go forward - and that would provide further opportunities to attempt amendments.\n\nWinning the next meaningful vote is only the beginning of a new phase of Brexit; it's not even the beginning of the end.\n\nRead Mark's full blog", "description": "MPs could vote four times on Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F397/production/_109295326_ukparliament_jessicataylor.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
