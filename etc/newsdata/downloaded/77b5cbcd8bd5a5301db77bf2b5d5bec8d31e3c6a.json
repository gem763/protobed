credit agencies in other countries, such as Sweden, by capping lending to fossil fuel projects.\n\nIt urged the department to commit funding only to projects which align with the government\u2019s target of net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nResponding to the committee, the international trade secretary insisted Britain was \u201cplaying a leading role in the transition to a low carbon future\u201d but there \u201cremains a need for a mix of energy sources and technologies\u201d.\n\nIn a letter published on Tuesday, Ms Truss said the government was \u201cmindful that the transition to a low carbon economy, both in the UK and overseas, must also be equitable\u201d.\n\nShe wrote: \u201cln developing countries, energy security is central to continued development and poverty alleviation. The UK\u2019s oil and gas sector is a significant source of skilled jobs across different regions of the UK and continues to play an essential role in the UK\u2019s energy security even as we transition to lower carbon and renewable energy sources.\u201d\n\nLabour MP Mary Creagh, who chairs the committee, said it was \u201cunbelievable\u201d the government had \u201crejected our call to end taxpayer money being poured into new high carbon projects\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe called for the government to commit to only back British business export projects that support the UK\u2019s climate goals. Their refusal to do so completely undermines the government\u2019s commitment to get to net zero emissions by 2050.\n\n\u201cPeople expect their political leaders try to stop, not accelerate, the pace of climate breakdown.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental campaign group Global Witness said the government\u2019s position was one of \u201cutter hypocrisy\u201d.\n\nSenior climate campaigner Adam McGibbon added: \u201cJust last week the prime minister was in New York, for the UN Climate Summit, pledging action whilst his government at home was committing to funding fossil fuel projects abroad.\n\n\u201cThe UK is trying to portray itself as a global climate leader ahead of the UN climate summit in Glasgow next year, but this stands violently at odds with reality.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Ban Ki-moon, the former secretary general of the United Nations, called UKEF\u2019s fossil fuel investments \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and said they were \u201chard to reconcile\u201d with the government\u2019s commitment to limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\n\n\u201cThere is now a growing consensus that fossil fuels should not be funded in any way by export finance organisations,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn April, teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg told MPs the UK\u2019s active support for new exploitation of fossil fuels was \u201cbeyond absurd\u201d and \u201cirresponsible behaviour\u201d.\n\nA report by the Committee on Climate Change in May warned UKEF was \u201cnot aligned with climate goals and often supports high-carbon investments\u201d.\n\nThe following month UKEF announced it had agreed to lend \u00a3406m to companies working on the expansion of a state-run Bahraini oil refinery.\n\nIt is currently also considering whether to grant funding for gas drilling platforms off the coast of Mozambique, a project advisers have warned could have \u201csignificant adverse\u201d environmental impacts.\n\nCompanies to have received funding from UKEF in recent years include Turkish construction firm Enka, which was handed \u00a3578m in subsidies for its work on two gas-fired power plants in Iraq.\n\nThe company\u2019s subsidiary, registered in the UK in 2016 without an office, staff or operations in the country, was granted the money on the condition at least 20 per cent of contracts on the project went to British businesses.", "description": "The government has been accused of \u201cutter hypocrisy\u201d after it rejected calls from MPs to stop spending billions on overseas fossil fuel projects while claiming to be a leader in the fight against global warming.
