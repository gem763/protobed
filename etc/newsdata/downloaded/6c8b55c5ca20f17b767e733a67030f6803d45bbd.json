Subscribers can also access 3,000 instructional cooking videos on-demand.\n\nAnd in select cities, subscribers to the interactive cooking service will have ingredients mailed to their homes through Amazon Fresh and the Food Network Kitchen app, while pots, pans, utensils and appliances will be available through Amazon in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to be working with Discovery to bring the new Food Network Kitchen content to Echo Show, Fire Tablets, and Fire TV,\" said Dave Limp, senior vice president, Amazon Devices and Services. \"We hope the combination of Food Network\u2019s world class cooking content and the simplicity of Alexa inspires and delights customers throughout every part of their cooking journey \u2013 whether they\u2019re a seasoned cook or just starting out,\u201d\n\nModeling itself off of the popular Pelaton platform, which is an interactive exercise class designed for people to use in the comforts of their own homes, Discovery and Amazon said they will be featuring the likes of Bobby Flay, Daniel Boulud, and Guy Fieri as celebrity chefs on the Food Network Kitchen service.\n\nAmazon will be handling distribution in terms of ingredients and eventually cooking apparatuses, while Discovery will provide content creation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSubscribers to Food Network Kitchen will be able to stream classes through Fire TV and Fire Tablet and they will be integrated with Amazon\u2019s Alexa.
