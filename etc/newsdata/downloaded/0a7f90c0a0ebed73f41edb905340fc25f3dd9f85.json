They brought their book tour to Washington\u2019s Lisner Auditorium on Friday. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nColumnist\n\nHillary Clinton is suddenly everywhere these days, except for where roughly 66 million Americans wish she were, which is the White House.\n\nShe\u2019s on \u201cThe View.\u201d She\u2019s on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\u201d She told \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that the bravest thing she\u2019d ever done was to stay in her marriage; she told People magazine that voters should \u201cget over it\u201d \u2014 \u201cit\u201d being Joe Biden\u2019s handsiness with women. Actually, that\u2019s not quite what she said \u2014 she was making a point about the need to defeat President Trump \u2014 but that was the interpretation that became engraved in the news cycle because, well, it seemed like the kind of tone-deaf thing she might say?\n\nShe went to Venice for a famous art festival, and while she was at that art festival she performed in an installation, and for that installation she sat behind a re-creation of the Oval Office\u2019s Resolute Desk, and while sitting at the desk, wearing a fancy caftan and symbolically acknowledging the dumbest whataboutism to emerge from the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton read her emails.\n\nShe has tweeted. She has clapped back. Rudy Giuliani claimed that Joe Biden hadn\u2019t been properly vetted because he was protected by the Clintons. \u201cYes,\u201d Clinton dryly replied. \u201cI am famously underscrutinized.\u201d\n\nAnd she\u2019s right, of course, my God, it\u2019s hard to think of another human whom we so love to hate and so hate to love, and can\u2019t get rid of, and then fiercely miss as soon as we do.\n\nMost recently, on Friday night, she was in Washington to promote a new book \u2014 her second book and her third national tour since losing to Trump three years ago.\n\nSo there we were \u2014 again \u2014 buying an expensive ticket \u2014 again \u2014 to listen to Hillary Clinton \u2014 again \u2014 and think about what she meant to us. Or means. Or will mean, a decade from now when we\u2019re still stuck in whatever codependent relationship this is.\n\n\u201cI am crying,\u201d a young woman informed her seat mate as Clinton walked onstage to a standing ovation and sat in a cushioned chair at George Washington University\u2019s Lisner Auditorium. The young woman repeated, as if her wet face were not self-evident: \u201cI am crying.\u201d\n\nLissa Muscatine, the evening\u2019s moderator, settled in next to Clinton and her daughter and co-author, Chelsea, also on the tour. Muscatine \u2014 a longtime Clinton speechwriter and co-owner of Politics and Prose bookstore, which helped organize the event \u2014 waited until the tearful applause died down, and then, facing the audience, revved it back up again: \u201cIs there a gutsier woman than Hillary Rodham Clinton?\u201d\n\n\"Gutsy Women.\" Yes! This is the title of the new book! A dutiful periwinkle brick. The pages are glossy, the chapters are short and the women inside are gutsy. This is the kind of book that seems perfect for very specific audiences, and those audiences are: stepmoms searching for books to help them bond with their spouse's daughters. Parents looking to supplement a favorite teacher's classroom library. Thirty-four-year-old women who are about to spend the holidays with their future mothers-in-law and still don't have a Christmas gift.\n\nIt is very easy to picture this book being unwrapped. It\u2019s harder to picture this book being read, cover to cover, with a sense of delight. Mostly, it feels like a laborious collection of Wikipedia entries on women and girls you\u2019ve already heard of \u2014 Helen Keller, Harriet Tubman, Anne Frank \u2014 plus a few you might not have, like Somali obstetrician Hawa Abdi or \u201cSesame Street\u201d creator Joan Ganz Cooney.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing particularly inspired about the idea or execution; there\u2019s nothing wrong with it either. Hillary and Chelsea describe it as an \u201congoing conversation\u201d between the two of them, a manifestation of Sally Ride\u2019s idea that sharing women\u2019s stories is important because \u201cyou can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see.\u201d This book is a compendium of all the women you might like to see and be, organized into categories: inventors, healers, storytellers, etc.\n\nMother and daughter have done an admirable job of showcasing not only diverse professions but also diverse beliefs, backgrounds, races and sexual orientations. Danica Roem, the first openly transgender person to be elected and serve in a state legislature, gets an entry. So does Olympian Caster Semenya, whose biology has been the subject of prurient scrutiny. Their inclusion is important: quiet affirmations that \u201cbeing a woman\u201d can look all kinds of different ways.\n\nI want to love this book.\n\nAnd that, of course, is how millions of readers will know that Hillary Clinton wrote it. Because holding it in my hands, this book, which is well-researched, and historically significant, and which represents everything I hold dear, a book that seems thoughtful and prepared, a book that probably had a plan for campaign finance reform and climate change, and couldn\u2019t help that its horndog husband abused his power with an intern more than 20 years ago (but should really stop complicitly brushing off the offense now) \u2014 holding this book in my hands, I cannot tell how much I actually love it, and how much I just desperately, desperately wish I did.\n\nWhat more can we possibly want from this woman?\n\nAnd by woman, I mean, book?\n\nHere are some things Hillary and Chelsea told us onstage:\n\nHillary still writes everything longhand, which drove Chelsea crazy as a collaborating author: \u201cI thought surely she would have to understand why track changes are important.\u201d\n\nHillary admires teen environmental activist Greta Thunberg because she\u2019s been criticized by \u201ceveryone from Donald Trump to Vladi\u00admir Putin, so you know she\u2019s doing something right.\u201d\n\nChelsea, as a little girl, once wrote a letter to President Ronald Reagan begging him not to visit a Nazi cemetery because she\u2019d learned via \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d that Nazis were bad. She was devastated not to get a response; later, as first lady, Hillary started an initiative to make sure children who wrote the White House would always get responses.\n\nHillary wanted to write this book partly because she wanted to make sure the country didn\u2019t lose any ground it had gained for women: \u201cWe\u2019re not giving up, we\u2019re not going back, we\u2019re not going to let \u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 happen.\u201d\n\nAn audience-submitted question from someone named Alex asked Hillary what she did whenever she was \u201cnot feeling her gutsiest.\u201d\n\n\u201cP.S.\u201d Muscatine said, reading Alex\u2019s note aloud. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\nHillary laughed. When she\u2019s not feeling gutsy, \u201cI think about you, Alex.\u201d She was kidding. But, she explained, she did think about the gutsy women and men who inspired her.\n\nHillary believes that \u201cTrump knows he\u2019s an illegitimate president.\u201d She also believes that \u201cimpeachment is the appropriate remedy. I am all in favor of what the House is doing. . . . This president has to be held to account.\u201d\n\nThe audience gobbled it all up. The audience, more women than men, more young than old (it was a college campus), snorted it up, as one snorts the heady drug of the alternate reality you all thought would come to pass.\n\n\"I love Hillary,\" says Sarah Harig, an audience member I talked to after the event. She'd shown up four hours before the reading to ensure good seats.\n\n\u201cI love Hillary,\u201d adds Harig\u2019s friend Casey Archer.\n\n\u201cShe loves Hillary,\u201d says Kartic Padmanabhan, pointing to his 9-year-old, whom he had brought along for a father-daughter date.\n\n\u201cWe love Hillary,\u201d says Laura Hennessey, nodding to her companion Mary Thornton. \u201cWe love the relationship she has with her daughter.\u201d\n\nThornton is quiet for a moment, and then confesses it\u2019s because the question I\u2019d asked her, Why are you here?, had made her choke up.\n\n\u201cShe should be president,\u201d Thornton says finally. \u201cThe hatred directed toward her is unimaginable, and she should be president.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love Hillary,\u201d says a woman named Rose who won\u2019t give me her last name for reasons that soon become apparent. \u201cI didn\u2019t, but I do, but I was frustrated by her, but now . . .\u201d\n\nRose, no last name, was so frustrated by Hillary that she didn\u2019t vote for her. She wrote someone else in. It was meant to be a protest. She thought Hillary had the election in the bag. She feels terrible. She doesn\u2019t quite remember, now, what quality seemed so bad about Hillary, at least not compared with Donald Trump, that she felt the need to protest it.\n\nHere is what I think many people want from Hillary.\n\nI think they want to live in a world in which they are allowed to love Hillary but be exasperated by her comments on Joe Biden. Allowed to protest her. Allowed to become justifiably incensed by her positions \u2014 too liberal? too conservative? \u2014 because, in this alternate reality, they are weighty policies made by the president of the United States, rather than inconsequential comments made by a retired politician who is hawking another book.\n\nI think they want to be able to say that Hillary wasn\u2019t perfect. I think they want to be able to talk about her in the complicated way she deserves to be talked about, rather than defensively pretend she\u2019s a saint merely because the people attacking her are so rabidly crazy and sexist.\n\nIt would be lovely, just lovely, if instead of being a gutsy woman, Hillary was just a boring president.\n\nIt would be lovely if we could look at her as a human instead of a reminder of messy marriages and messy times and the limits of our own forgiveness and the repercussions of letting the perfect be the enemy of the sane.\n\nEvery time Hillary Clinton makes another public appearance, she is giving us a gift. The gift is not her mediocre book. The gift is not magnetic wit. The gift is all her complications. The gift is being able to tell her to go away while simultaneously wishing she would never leave.\n\nMonica Hesse is a columnist writing about gender and its impact on society.
