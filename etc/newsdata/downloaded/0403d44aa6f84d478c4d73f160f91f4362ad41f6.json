The next he ruminated about what a mistake it had been for the United States to get entangled in Middle East wars and welcomed Iran\u2019s president to visit.\n\nTo help sort through the alternatives, Mr. Trump on Wednesday named a hawkish new national security adviser, Robert C. O\u2019Brien, the State Department\u2019s chief hostage negotiator. But as Mr. Trump spoke with reporters, shouting to be heard over the roar of Air Force One engines, Mr. Trump sounded like a commander in chief searching for a way to be tough without pulling the trigger.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to attack, but if you ask Lindsey, ask him how did going into the Middle East, how did that work out? And how did going into Iraq work out?\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters, referring to Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Republican ally who warned against showing \u201cweakness\u201d toward Iran. \u201cSo we have a disagreement on that. And you know, there\u2019s plenty of time to do some dastardly things. It\u2019s very easy to start.\u201d", "description": "To help sort through the options \u2014 including sanctions and the deployment of more American forces \u2014 the president chose Robert C.
