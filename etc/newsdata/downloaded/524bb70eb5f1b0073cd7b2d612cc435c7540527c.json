If we lose a soldier, we will have 10,000 born in his place,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nAhmet Kaymaz, watching from the nearby customs gate, said he would not leave.\n\n\u201cWe will not go anywhere. We will die in Akcakale,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cCan a person leave their motherland? We will not abandon it.\u201d\n\nA farmer, Ahmet Celikcan, who had travelled especially from his nearby village to watch the action, said he believed the government was not interested in seizing Syrian land and that the operation would allow the return of refugees.\n\n\u201cIt is for the Syrians who are here that we want this. We do not want anything there. We don\u2019t have our eyes on any land,\u201d he said.", "description": "Ak\u00e7akale (Turkey) (AFP) \u2013 Mixed feelings permeated the Turkish town of Akcakale on the border with Syria on Thursday, with families fleeing a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/d18c25_residents-fled-turkish-border-town-akcakale-stayed-watch-troops-push-syria-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
