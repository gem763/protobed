We explain why this is the case. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nTrump needs the protection that comes with staying president. But Ukraine has accomplished what Robert Mueller could not: America is paying attention.\n\nThe thing about being president is that your every move, past and present, is subject to microscopic examination. That can be a problem if your closet is filled with skeletons \u2026or decomposing bodies.\n\nIn Donald Trump\u2019s case, his skeletons often include legal jeopardy. The most recent example of his legal exposure is the whistleblower complaint that detailed Trump\u2019s efforts to persuade the president of Ukraine to produce dirt on political rival Joe Biden, possibly in exchange for the release of U.S. financial aid. Trump\u2019s solicitation could well be a violation of federal campaign contribution laws.\n\nWhile the whistleblower allegations are at the center of the newly official congressional impeachment inquiry, the president\u2019s latest legal breach is preceded by a long line of similar activities. Who could forget the New York U.S. Attorney\u2019s \u201cporngate\u201d indictment in which Trump is named as an unindicted co-conspirator, \u201cIndividual 1,\u201d alongside his former personal attorney? Or the multiple examples of criminal obstruction set forth in former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report?\n\nTrump can be indicted for past crimes\n\nWhile it appears to many Americans that Trump is above the law, this status is only conferred on him as long as he remains president. An Office of Legal Counsel opinion forbids the indictment of a sitting president but offers no protection to a former president. Once he leaves office, Trump can be indicted for past crimes, including those he committed as president.\n\nAt that point, his only legal protection will be the statute of limitations \u2014 the time limit for charging a crime. The federal statute of limitations for most crimes, including campaign finance and obstruction violations, is five years.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in New York on Sept. 25, 2019.

But paying hush money to Stormy Daniels, firing FBI Director James Comey, and ordering the White House counsel to fire Mueller are all fair game for indictment if Trump does not win a second term.\n\nThis sobering recognition on Trump\u2019s part could be fueling what appears to be his escalating desperation to ensure that he secures another four years in the White House.\n\nHe'll burn the house down to win 2020\n\nThe cards, as Trump has played them, leave him in a predicament. If he loses the 2020 election, he will be red meat for a Democratic president and attorney general eager to hold him accountable for his flagrant abuses of power. To avoid being fed to the Democrats, Trump\u2019s best bet is to follow the tried-and-true playbook that secured his 2016 win. This means illegally soliciting foreign assistance in the upcoming election.\n\nIf time and experience have shown us anything about Trump, it is that he is willing to burn the house down to secure his own advantage. How else to explain his recent effort with Ukraine? It is essentially the same crime that put him in Mueller\u2019s sights for nearly two years.\n\nAnd it accomplished what Mueller could not. The former special counsel\u2019s 448-page report showed a sprawling pattern of corruption. The call between Trump and the Ukrainian president is a discrete nugget of corruption that has a beginning and an end, and it's easily understood. It\u2019s perfectly geared to the many Americans who view politics like a TV sitcom \u2014 23 minutes of attention and done.\n\nNothing to see here: Is Donald Trump's Justice Department part of the Ukraine scandal cover-up?\n\nAt the moment, impeachment is the best bet for Democrats. Unlike a criminal prosecution, impeachment does not require strict adherence to a criminal statute. And unlike a criminal trial, one MAGA juror cannot derail the train.\n\nReelection is Trump's only protection\n\nAssuming the House votes in favor of articles of impeachment, it looks unlikely at this point that there will be enough straight-spined Republicans to convict and remove Trump in a Senate trial. Even so, impeachment in the House will have its own rewards, including a rallying cry to flip the Senate.\n\nAnd the tide might be turning on Trump. Even the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard Burr of North Carolina, is conducting an \u201cinquiry\u201d into the whistleblower complaint. But even if the critical mass of Trump\u2019s apparent effort to trade U.S. money for dirt on a political rival reaches hurricane proportions, Trump will not go quietly. To the contrary. Think feral cat cornered in a back alley. Trump has already floated the idea of executing those involved in blowing the whistle on his under-the-table deal with Ukraine.\n\nPunishing treason the old-fashioned way: Trump's new impeachable offense is threatening the life of a CIA officer\n\nIn order to maximize the political punch that comes with impeachment proceedings, Democrats must abandon the \u201cwhen they go low, we go high\u201d platitude. With all due respect to former first lady Michelle Obama, those days are long gone. If House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and his congressional backup singers are not willing to fight in the mud, Democrats will be forever eating Republican dust.\n\nIn 2016, Trump\u2019s run for the presidency was motivated by narcissism and greed. In 2020, Trump needs the protection that comes with reelection. Don\u2019t expect him to go from a solid gold toilet to an industrial prison urinal without a fight.\n\nMichael J.
