Her sister, right, Danica, played Winnie Cooper. They are pictured here in 1991\n\nAlthough the notes weren't signed, the envelopes sometimes contained a return address with the initials of the purported sender.\n\nThe initials allegedly 'caused more than one recipient to assume the letters originated from one of Mithril's more significant limited partners,' the suit suggests.\n\nBosses at the firm decided to employ the services of a forensic handwriting expert. They managed to identify McKellar as their author.\n\nThe findings shocked Mithril especially after the praise McKellar had given Royan before she departed the company.\n\nMcKellar wrote that he was 'a person of great personal integrity' who is 'brilliant at tech investing.'\n\nBut it appears that no sooner had McKellar left the company, within a month she began roles at three other venture capital firms, despite having signed a non-compete agreement.\n\nThe suit alleges McKellar attempted to 'solicit Mithril's limited partners almost immediately' claiming that her former firm was being investigated by US regulators.\n\nThe breach of contract suit seeks more than $1 million in damages.", "description": "Crystal McKellar, 43, a former child actor and lawyer for Mithril Capital based in Austin, is accused of spreading rumors to partners and competitors after leaving Peter Thiel's company.", "authors": ["James Gordon For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/06/19284434-0-image-a-54_1570167479868.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
