The best deal of the bunch is on the Fitbit Versa Lite, which is currently $119.95. That\u2019s $30 off of its usual $159.95 price. This is the biggest price drop yet for this model, and it can track sleep and various exercises. However, it doesn\u2019t offer music playback, swim laps, floors traveled, or Wi-Fi connectivity \u2014 features found in the more expensive Versa. Speaking of the Versa, that\u2019s a little cheaper, too. It\u2019s $169.95 instead of its usual $199.95 price.\n\nThe Versa is a good option for most people, unless you want to track your runs or walks without bringing a phone with you. If that describes you, the Fitbit Ionic has GPS built-in, as well as NFC for contactless payments, and support for all of the workouts listed above. The Ionic is $169.95, as well, down from $249.95.\n\nRelated Here are the best Amazon Prime Day 2019 deals so far\n\nLastly, Fitbit\u2019s Ace fitness tracker for kids is almost half off at Amazon. It\u2019s $59.95 (usually $99.95) until Prime Day ends tonight. This is a showerproof tracker that provides more encouragement for kids than the other Fitbit models do, so it\u2019s the best fit for your kid if they want to be active.", "description": "If you don\u2019t want to spend over $200 for an Apple Watch, Fitbit\u2019s fitness trackers, like the Versa, Ionic, and Ace are up to $80 off of the usual prices for Amazon Prime Day 2019.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MA3QHIo2yn31M7LI_wrUnKiLOAU=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15588834/ngarun_190305_3273_0034.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-16"}
