I just knew it had to be in a Caesar,\" said Allan, who won a contest using Jugo Maggi as a secret ingredient in his adaptation of the classic Canadian drink.\n\n\"This sauce is so meaty and rich and big,\" he said.\n\n\"Without [tasting] like \u2014 a medium-rare steak per se.\"\n\nMaggi ranked as a top-five consumer brand globally\n\nJugo Maggi \u2014 more commonly known as Maggi Seasoning \u2014 is one of the most popular condiments on earth.\n\nThe market research firm Kantar, which publishes a report every year ranking the brand footprint of the world's most recognized consumer packaged goods, pegs Maggi at number three.\n\nThat puts the sauce just behind giants such as Coca-Cola or Colgate.\n\nThere are more than 7,000 'stock keeping units' of Maggi products sold in 98 countries around the world, in forms such as soups, seasonings, noodles and sauces. (Nestl\u00e9)\n\nNestl\u00e9, which owns the Maggi brand, estimates that more than 4,600 food portions are prepared across the world using Maggi products every second. Larger markets include Germany, India, the Middle East and Central and West Africa.\n\nEveryone thinks it's theirs\n\nWhile Canadians and Americans remain largely in the dark when it comes to Maggi, many other cultures likes to claim it as their own.\n\nCalgary restaurateur Shovik Sengupta thought it was from India, where his family originated. He grew up with Maggi Hot and Sweet Sauce, and its taste evokes memories of childhood.\n\n\"Maggi entered my life early,\" said 40-year-old Sengupta, who explained his family would go to India every few years to spend the entire summer.\n\n\"There were always Maggi commercials. Sitting in certain restaurants, they'd have chutneys but they'll often have a bottle of Maggi Hot and Sweet at the table.\"\n\nSengupta is co-owner of Calcutta Cricket Club, a hip restaurant on Calgary's famous 17th Avenue SW, and said he spreads his love for Maggi through the restaurant's kati rolls.\n\nAccording to Sengupta, the sauce adds a critical \"umami\" taste to the menu offering.\n\nThe secret is umami, via hydrolyzed vegetable protein\n\nUmami is a Japanese word that roughly translates to \"delicious, savoury taste.\"\n\nIf there's one thing Maggi is known for, it's adding a little umami magic.\n\nCentral to many Maggi products is an ingredient called hydrolyzed vegetable protein, produced by boiling foods such as soy, corn, or wheat in hydrochloric acid and then neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide.\n\n\"It doesn't sound appealing but it adds such an interesting and essential flavour even to plain rice, that's why it's travelled all over the world,\" said Maryann Tebben, author of Sauces: A Global History.\n\nSauces that are popular across different cuisines tend to be versatile, she said.\n\n\"The Maggi company allows individual countries to sort of tweak the formula so it might be a little more pungent or a little more salty,\" said Tebben.\n\nThe North American market\n\nSo why hasn't Maggi, or any of its 7,000 versions, been able to capture the North American market and become a kitchen staple in every household?\n\nIt's a tale of food history \u2014 and competition.\n\nShovik Sengupta grew up with Maggi. The hot and sweet sauce is now featured in his restaurant in Calgary. (Falice Chin/CBC)\n\nJulius Maggi, the Swiss creator and namesake of the Maggi empire, became a pioneer in food production in the mid-1880s when he created a new type of flour made with ground-up peas and beans in Zurich. Soon after came the company's first concentrated bouillon.\n\nAn old advertisement from 1895 was found by soy historian Bill Shurtleff, who wrote 40 books on soy-based foods.\n\nIt listed Maggi bouillon next to Liebig's Extract of Meat\n\n\"They must have been very similar products,\" said Shurtleff.\n\nBut in America, Maggi sauce ran into another competitor \u2014 one that had cornered the market a few decades earlier.\n\nJulius Maggi (1846-1912) was the Swiss founder of Maggi Seasoning. (Nestl\u00e9)\n\n\"Lea and Perrins got their Worcestershire sauce on every ocean liner leaving and coming into Britain by paying the head steward a fee for each bottle that he took,\" said Shurtleff.\n\n\"People who were on those liners who were obviously wealthy tasted this thing like they'd never tasted before.\"\n\nBy the time Maggi came around, Shurtleff said America had gone through a Worcestershire sauce craze. Imitations had popped up all over the country and the New York Times archives from the latter half of the 19th century are peppered with legal notices from Lea and Perrins challenging the imitators.\n\nThe taste of meat \u2014 without the meat\n\nThere is one final detail that could help solve the mystery of why Maggi isn't as popular in North America.\n\nMaggi was created to add a meat-like, umami flavour to food.\n\nPulses \u2014 the main ingredient in Maggi's early creations \u2014 were seen as a solution to improving the lives of Swiss workers, because in Nestl\u00e9's words, \"nutritious meat was beyond their meagre budgets.\"\n\nThe Worcestershire sauce was so popular in the late 19th century, imitations popped up all over the U.S. (Soyinfo Center)\n\nThough Nestl\u00e9 Canada declined to comment on its marketing strategy, from the beginning Maggi seasoning has been advertised as a vegetarian product.\n\nMaggi creates a meat flavour without a hefty price. It's an irresistible promise for many places in the world, but less so in North America.\n\n\"We are used to getting our flavour ... from things like steak and hamburgers and other types of meat,\" said soy historian Shurtleff.\n\nNorth Americans eat the real thing\n\nAmericans and Canadians still lead most of the world when it comes to meat consumption per capita.\n\n\"We are addicted to meat,\" said Sylvain Charlebois, professor of food distribution at Dalhousie University.\n\n\"Number one, the socio-cultural factor. Basically, it's part of our diet,\" he said.\n\n\"Two, wealth. You need wealth in the economy to eat meat.\"\n\nIn addition, North Americans are often not enticed by offal or organ meats, including traditional dishes from Anglo-Saxon cultures such as black pudding, head cheese and haggis. That reflects our abundance of expensive meat in recent history, and with an abundance of expensive meat \u2014 Maggi is not a necessity to add umami.\n\nNot only can we skip the entrails, we don't even need the seasoning.\n\nBecause who needs Maggi, when you've got steak?\n\nWritten by Falice Chin.", "description": "More than 4,600 food portions are prepared across the world using Maggi products every second, according to Nestl\u00e9.
