Like many Soros-related claims, this one is, well, flimsy. Indeed, Guiliani\u2019s argument appears to rest almost entirely on innuendos, a single op-ed in The Hill, and his vague claims about unnamed \u201cpeople\u201d in Ukraine.\n\nRussia\u2019s Election Hackers Are Back\u2014and Targeting George Soros\n\nGiuliani\u2019s allegations center on a \u201cSoros NGO\u201d that manufactured evidence against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a former FBI agent who Giuliani claims is on Soros\u2019s payroll.\n\n\u201cGeorge Soros has a not-for-profit called AntAC,\u201d Giuliani said in a CNN appearance last Thursday. \u201cAntAC is the one that developed all of the dirty information that ended up being a false document that was created in order to incriminate Manafort.\u201d\n\nIn a Monday appearance on Fox Business, Giuliani claimed that \u201cSoros\u2019s NGO was involved in this whole thing.\u201d On Tuesday, he told Fox News host Laura Ingraham that Biden was somehow involved in an effort to save a Soros-run organization in Ukraine from prosecution.\n\n\u201cThat organization was run by George Soros, who then hired the crooked FBI agent, who is now working for George Soros,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nSoros, who is one of the Democratic Party\u2019s largest givers, has long been targeted by right-wing activists, who often paint him as a global, political puppetmaster\u2014a charge that critics contend reeks of anti-Semitism. Few figures, indeed, are more often portrayed as a boogeyman by Republican politicians.\n\nGuliani\u2019s vague, nefarious accusations about Soros, have been echoed by Trump allies and the Trump campaign as well. In fact, the line has become so central to the messaging war against the Bidens that Giuliani often offers it up without being prompted.\n\n\u201cOh, and Soros\u2014Soros!\u2014is very important here,\u201d Giuliani said in a Monday interview, one of several with The Daily Beast in the last few days in which he discussed the progressive donor. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that.\u201d\n\nConsidering the gravity with which Giuliani discusses Soros, one would think that there is ample evidence that something untoward has taken place. And yet, the allegations rest largely on a March 2019 op-ed in The Hill written by opinion writer John Solomon, who became a star on the right for his willingness to push attacks on Special Counsel Robert Mueller. In his March story, Solomon declared that the U.S. embassy in Ukraine \u201cpressed Ukraine to drop [a] probe of George Soros group during 2016 election.\u201d\n\nThe op-ed centers on Anticorruption Action Centre (AntAC), a Ukrainian anti-corruption group that has received funding from Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation. Contrary to Giuliani\u2019s description of it as \u201cSoros-run,\u201d though, AntAC has also received funding from the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and the European Union. Soros doesn\u2019t control AntAC\u2019s activities. It is instead operated by Ukrainian activists.\n\nIn 2016, AntAC was under investigation by Ukrainian prosecutors for the alleged misuse of $4.4 million in aid, in what appears to have been a politically motivated pursuit from the investigators meant to punish the good-governance group. Even U.S. State Department sources in Solomon\u2019s own op-ed said the prosecution was believed to be just \u201cretribution\u201d for AntAC\u2019s anti-corruption work. In a letter sent to Ukrainian prosecutors, a State Department official in Ukraine said the United States had \u201cno concerns\u201d about the money.\n\n\"We have accounted for every single foreign assistance dollar provided within the framework of this project,\u201d the State official continued.\n\nSmollett Conspiracy Theories Target George Soros\n\nNevertheless, Giuliani has accused the group, without any evidence, of falsifying the \u201cBlack Ledger\u201d that listed millions in undisclosed payments to Manafort and setting the stage for his prosecution. But that document has never been disproven, as a story from The Intercept investigating Giuliani\u2019s claims found, and AntAC wasn\u2019t involved in its creation.", "description": "HERBERT NEUBAUER/GettyDonald Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani\u2019s bizarre media tour defending President Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure the president of Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden has focused on a seemingly unrelated target: billionaire Democratic financier and Republican bogeyman George Soros.\u00a0In several", "authors": ["Will Sommer", "Asawin Suebsaeng"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WYQ3NhXWrlE41Lce1TraJw--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/e7be9d1cf8beb3fed4de718fb8f41ddf", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
