At first it had been suspended for the infraction of . . . unknown. He reached out to the Twitter bureaucrats: What gives? Came the nebulous response:\n\nHello, We received your appeal regarding your account. Please reply to this message and confirm that you have access to this email address. Once we receive your confirmation, we\u2019ll review the information you provided and will respond as soon as possible. We typically suspend accounts for violations of the Twitter Rules (https://twitter.com/rules) or Terms of Service (https://twitter.com/tos). Additionally, repeat violations may result in permanent account suspension. Thanks, Twitter Support\n\nA few hours later, he was sent a nameless/faceless/details-less communication by Twitter:\n\nHello, Your account has been suspended and will not be restored because it was found to be violating the Twitter Terms of Service, specifically the Twitter Rules against managing multiple Twitter accounts for abusive purposes. You can learn more about our rules around multiple accounts and against abusive behavior here: https://twitter.com/rules. Please note that creating new account(s) to evade this suspension is also against the Twitter Rules and will result in additional account suspension(s). Thanks, Twitter\n\n\u201cThanks, Twitter.\u201d That\u2019s rich.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo Merritt\u2019s increasingly popular account is now permanently kiboshed, his 20,000 followers disappeared, and his right (well, ability) to create a new handle non-existent \u2014 indeed, it\u2019s expressly forbidden. He has been rendered a Twitterverse non-person. The reason why this has come to pass remains unknown, except to Twittercrats who issued the death sentence.\n\nMerritt has co-founded two uber-patriotic companies (employing hundreds in the Savannah area): Nine Line Apparel and Georgia Land and Cattle. They\u2019re about a lot of things, including guns and Old Glory. In the past, he has noticed that when he tweeted about such topics, his retweets, likes, etc. experienced a huge drop-off. He felt he was being targeted for ghost banning, and believes his strong Second Amendment stand is the principle reason behind his account\u2019s eventual demise.\n\nThe Merritt campaign (here\u2019s the website) is intentionally a grassroots effort, hence it\u2019s dependent on social-media platforms for getting out messages (his opponent, incumbent Republican congressman Buddy Carter, one of the House\u2019s wealthier members, might not have so constrained a reelection strategy). So this is a big and suspicious blow.\n\nWhat we do know is this: The platoon leader who risked his life in Iraq\u2019s Tigris River Valley so Twitter (yes, a private company) could contrive its special brand of more Miranda-philic rights \u2014 and enforce them regularly on distinctly conservative voices \u2014 has found out that no good favor goes unpunished in the Silicon Valley.", "description": "Daniel Merritt, the conservative combat vet now running for Congress in Georgia, has had his Twitter account shut down.", "authors": ["Jack Fowler", "Andrew C.
