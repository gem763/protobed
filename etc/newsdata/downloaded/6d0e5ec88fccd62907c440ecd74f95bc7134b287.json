(AP) - Connecticut will receive $2.9 million in federal funding over 18 months to develop a plan to provide more substance abuse services to Medicaid recipients\n\nThe goal of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services grant is to ultimately increase the capacity of Medicaid providers to deliver substance abuse disorder treatment or recovery services.\n\nConnecticut plans to contract with a behavioral health company to assess the needs of individuals and the capacity of the current treatment system, and develop a plan to address the unmet needs of residents with substance abuse disorder. The Department of Social Services will contract with an actuarial firm to develop alternative payment models for providers.\n\nDSS Commissioner Deirdre Gifford says the funding will help lay the groundwork to make an even deeper impact on opiate misuse.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Connecticut will receive $2.9 million in federal funding over 18 months to develop a plan to provide more substance abuse services to Medicaid recipients", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
