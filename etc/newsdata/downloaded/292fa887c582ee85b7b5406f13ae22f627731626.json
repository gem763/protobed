The Ladykillers (2004) The first film in which Joel and Ethan Coen shared both producing and directing credits; previously Joel had always been credited as director and Ethan as producer. A largely pointless remake of the classic Ealing comedy, this has some funny moments and Tom Hanks gives a committed performance in the Alec Guinness role \u2013 but one can\u2019t help but wonder why they bothered. Touchstone Pictures 2/17 16. Intolerable Cruelty (2003) The film that preceded 'The Ladykillers', this was the siblings\u2019 first job as writers-for-hire. Tapping into a similar vein of screwball comedy to Preston Sturges's work in the Forties, it has a formidable cast: George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Geoffrey Rush are excellent. Yet this is a rare Coen comedy that does not stand up to a repeat viewing. Snap Stills/REX/Shutterstock 3/17 15. Hail, Caesar! (2016) Audiences felt misled by 'Hail, Caesar!' due to its panoply of Hollywood stars and laugh-heavy trailer. The result was a huge discrepancy in enjoyment between the critics and the punters. A love letter to the golden age of Hollywood, this is one of their lighter efforts, but some of the recreations of film styles of yore are dazzling. 4/17 14. Burn After Reading (2008) This one finds the lads in a playful mood: a spy caper populated with idiotic characters portrayed by the likes of George Clooney, Brad Pitt and John Malkovich (the latter\u2019s pronunciation of \u201cmemoir\u201d is a highlight). The plot is less important than the dialogue, characterisation and jokes. Pitt shows a real aptitude for comedy as a dim-witted fitness instructor. 5/17 13. True Grit (2010) Some see 'True Grit' as a poor man\u2019s 'No Country for Old Men', but this is a more faithful adaptation of the Charles Portis novel than the John Wayne version. The Coens, so often accused of cynicism, have rarely produced anything more heartfelt. Hailee Steinfeld, in her breakthrough role, is staggeringly good as a teenager attempting to avenge the murder of her father. REX 6/17 12. Miller\u2019s Crossing (1990) There are those who consider this gangster flick \u2014 released in the same year as Scorsese\u2019s 'Goodfellas' \u2014 to be the Coens' peak achievement. Slow and contemplative, the film contains two of the greatest moments in the entire Coen filmography: John Turturro in the woods and Albert Finney under the bed. Scorsese would later direct the pilot episode of 'Boardwalk Empire', a television show with more than a hint of 'Miller\u2019s Crossing'. 20th Century Fox 7/17 11. Raising Arizona (1987) The opening 11 minutes of the Coens\u2019 sophomore effort \u2014 before the title even appears \u2014 is one of the most beautiful, hilarious and perfectly executed sequences in modern cinema. Nicolas Cage didn\u2019t enjoy the experience of making 'Raising Arizona' since the filmmakers allow their actors very little leeway in terms of improvisation. Holly Hunter has rarely been better and this contains some of the funniest Coen scenes. 20th Century Fox 8/17 10. The Hudsucker Proxy (1994) The Coens attempt at a family film (\u201cyou know, for kids\u201d) that was expected to make waves at the box office but proved a flop, perhaps partly as a result of its idiosyncratic title. This is a comedy with shades of Sturges and Frank Capra. The flashback involving the tailor might be the most perfect gag in the entire Coen canon. Universal Pictures 9/17 9. Barton Fink (1991) John Turturro stars as Barton Fink, a playwright attempting to write a screenplay in a deserted hotel while wrestling with his demons and/or John Goodman. Sharp, with a good dose of pathos, it deservedly won the Palme d'Or in 1991. That the Coens decided to make a film about writer\u2019s block while they themselves were struggling to complete 'Miller\u2019s Crossing' means there's a personal element to it, too (\u201cI\u2019ll show you the life of the mind,\" says Goodman's Charlie Meadows). 10/17 8. A Serious Man (2009) A favourite with fans, this begins in a 19th-century Eastern European shelter and ends with the disclaimer that \u201cNo Jews were harmed in the making of this motion picture\u201d. In between, we are treated to the Coens\u2019 most personal film, pitched somewhere between the 'Book of Job' and Saul Bellow\u2019s 'Herzog'. Michael Stuhlbarg is mesmerising as a Minnesotan physics professor who sees his life fall apart in 1967. 11/17 7. O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000) The title may be a reference to Sullivan\u2019s Travels, and the plot inspired by Homer's 'The Odyssey', but this is an astonishingly original musical that stands as the most joyous film in the siblings\u2019 filmography. The soundtrack won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and this sepia-tinted tale of convicts on the run during the Great Depression never fails to lift the spirits. Touchstone/Universal/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock 12/17 6. Blood Simple (1984) The maverick filmmakers burst onto the scene with one of the most accomplished debuts in the history of the medium. Shot in just eight weeks, this is a startlingly violent neo-noir with moments of pure horror and that streak of bleak fatalism that would become a recurring theme. 13/17 5. Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) Quite possibly the film of the decade, 'Inside Llewyn Davis' stars Oscar Isaac as a folk singer struggling to make ends meet in and around the Greenwich Village scene of 1961. For anyone who\u2019s ever embarked on a creative pursuit and was worried that talent alone might not be enough, this is more terrifying than any horror. 14/17 4. The Man Who Wasn\u2019t There (2001) The Coens most underrated film, 'The Man Who Wasn\u2019t There' was inspired by a poster showing various haircuts from the 1940s that the brothers came across while shooting 'The Hudsucker Proxy'. Billy Bob Thornton has never been better than he is playing Ed Crane, a quiet barber who suspects his wife of having an affair and becomes embroiled in the kind of classic noir perfected by Billy Wilder. Working Title/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock 15/17 3. No Country for Old Men (2007) A crime classic cut from the same cloth as 'Fargo' and 'Blood Simple', this adaptation of Cormac McCarthy\u2019s novel won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay at the Oscars. It is the Coens\u2019 most taut film and their most critically acclaimed this century. Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh is a cinematic villain for the ages. 16/17 2. Fargo (1996) Deftly blending comedy and horror, this timeless crime caper propelled the Coens into the mainstream and spawned a widly successful television series. The screenplay won an Oscar; so, too, did Frances McDormand (wife of Joel) for her terrific performance as the pregnant police chief investigating a double homicide in Minnesota, birthplace of the filmmakers. 17/17 1. The Big Lebowski (1998) Creedence. White Russians. Bowling. We end where we began, and while some will argue that the Coen brothers have made deeper, wiser and worthier films \u2013 that\u2019s just, like, their opinion, man. This is their funniest work and, after a lacklustre reception, its reputation has grown to the point where it is now the quintessential cult movie. More importantly, for large swathes of us, it is absolutely guaranteed to ensure a good mood. The film, like its hero and the brothers behind it, abides. Rex Features 1/17 17.

Rex Features\n\nThe Jesus Rolls \u2013 inspired by Bertrand Blier\u2019s 1974 French film of the same name \u2013 has been approved by Joel and Ethan Coen.\n\nAfter years of reports about the film, Turturro recently told The Independent that he\u2019s completed an edit he\u2019s happy with \u2013 and he unveiled the final product at the 2019 Rome Film Festival this week.\n\nYou can read the first reviews of the film below.\n\nVariety\n\n\u201cWith his signature strut, hairnet-covered cornrows, purple-painted pinky nail and disarmingly high voice, Jesus Quintana may seem like a big joke to some (he was played that way in The Big Lebowski), but Turturro believes in him as a real, complex human being. With that in mind, the writer-director-star picks and chooses situations from Blier\u2019s controversial novel Les Valseuses to fuel this freewheeling joyride, about a pair of long-haired rabble-rousers who steal cars, stir up trouble and harass women at every stop.\u201d\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter\n\n\u201cTurturro\u2019s Jesus Quintana is certainly the best thing in this fluffy indie, and it\u2019s a pity he doesn\u2019t have a more meaningful trajectory. He gets an automatic laugh of appreciation posing in profile with his trademark purple pinkie nail, which is now supplemented by several gold rings and long braided hair. But these details are forgotten in the chain of repetitive joyrides in stolen muscle cars.\u201d\n\nNo other Big Lebowski characters are expected to show up in the film despite Jeff Bridges admitting he\u2019d be up for playing \u201ca little cameo\u201d as The Dude in the future.\n\nThe Jesus Rolls will be released in 2020.", "description": "The first reviews of the spin-off \u201csequel\u201d to\u00a0Coen brothers classic\u00a0The Big Lebowski\u00a0are in.", "authors": ["Jacob Stolworthy"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/18/09/john-turturro-jesus-big-lebowski.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
