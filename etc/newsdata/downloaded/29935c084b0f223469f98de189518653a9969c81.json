China has forcefully and repeatedly demanded that the US stay out of the country\u2019s internal affairs with regard to how it the handles the anti-government protests in Hong Kong.\n\nIn addition, on Monday the U.S. placed 28 Chinese public security bureaus and technology companies on a trade blacklist over Beijing\u2019s treatment of Uygur Muslims and other predominantly Muslim members of ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang.\n\nTo further complicate the situation, Trump has publicly requested that Beijing investigate the business affairs in China of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, a current leading Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cEspecially for the U.S. side, domestic politics make it hard for the trade talks to really be immune from other problems,\u201d said Louis Kuijs, the head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics.\n\nUntil this week, Taoran Notes, a social media account affiliated with the official Economic Daily that is used by Beijing to manage public expectations, had been expressing optimism about the result of the trade talk. But on Tuesday, it wrote that the likely result of the talks was a continuation of \u201ctalking while fighting.\"\n\n\u201cSome people may ask, if the U.S. raises tariffs further, is it still necessary to continue the talks \u2026 the answer is that it\u2019s as necessary to take countermeasures as to continue the talks,\u201d read commentary from Taoran Notes, hinting that China is ready to retaliate if the U.S. goes ahead with a planned tariff increase set to come into force next week.\n\nThe U.S. is scheduled to increase tariffs on US$250 billion worth of Chinese products from 25 percent to 30 percent on Tuesday, having delayed the implementation from last week to avoid clashing with the 70th anniversary of the founding of People\u2019s Republic of China on October 1.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. is threatening to impose a 15 percent tariff on US$160 billion worth of Chinese-made consumer goods on December 15, after a 15 percent levy on US$115 billion worth of such goods took effect on September 1.\n\nKuijs at Oxford Economics said that the US would probably go ahead with the tariff plan on October 15, which would trigger \u201csome retaliation\u201d from China, although he still expects the two countries to reach a small deal to call off the December tariffs.\n\n\u201cThe bar for a small deal does not seem to be very high,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile officially demanding that the U.S. withdraw all punitive tariffs, which now cover virtually all Chinese exports, China is continuing to place new orders for U.S. farm products such as soybeans and pork before the talks to pave the way for a possible mini-deal involving China buying American agricultural and energy products.\n\nIn turn, the U.S. would have to agree to postpone or scale back tariffs, sweeping thornier issues such as an enforcement mechanism, structural changes in Chinese intellectual property protections and government industrial subsidies aside at least in the short term.\n\nTrump, though, has said he prefers a comprehensive deal involving all elements rather than a small agreement on relatively easy issues.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come this far. We\u2019re doing well. I would much prefer a big deal and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re shooting for,\u201d Trump said on Monday.\n\nShen Jianguang, a veteran Chinese economy watcher and now the chief economist at JD Digit, said there was still a good chance for the talks in Washington to produce a tariff truce.\n\n\u201cIn previous rounds of talks when there were high expectations, a deal was always out of reach; the expectations for this new round of talks are low, but it doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be anything,\u201d Shen said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a comprehensive deal, but a formal truce is likely as both economies are gradually feeling the pain of the trade war.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/57/27/08f4fdc44b1eb643abde1db62f37/190905-liu-lighthizer-mnuchin-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
