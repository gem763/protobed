Thirty days later, they will reveal a series of shocking conspiracies that only the most perceptive \u2014 some might even say paranoid \u2014 sleuths could possibly uncover. And if they succeed in their mission, nobody will believe a word of it.\n\nThe project is called National Conspiracy Writing Month, an unofficial spinoff of the long-running National Novel Writing Month (or NaNoWriMo) challenge. Where NaNoWriMo requires participants to write a 50,000-word novel, the inaugural NaCoWriMo asks them to produce a \u201cdeep, viable, and complete conspiracy theory.\u201d Its creator Tim Hwang hopes these fake plots can illuminate a pervasive cultural phenomenon \u2014 helping both participants and spectators understand how conspiracy theories emerge. He just hopes people don\u2019t take them too seriously.\n\nNaCoWriMo is based on the idea that conspiracy theories are an artistic medium. \u201cFor better or for worse (frequently the worse), the genre of conspiracy includes some of the most narratively ambitious, memetically successful, and potent oral traditions of modern American life,\u201d Hwang explains in a Medium post. \u201cConspiracy theory is a uniquely powerful species of fan fiction about reality, one whose fandoms are capable of creating massive change.\u201d And the best way to understand these stories, he speculates, is to build one yourself.\n\nConspiracy theories have permeated American politics for decades, but in recent years, they\u2019ve become almost inescapable. President Donald Trump is an avid conspiracy theorist, boosting the long-standing \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy while running for office. Anti-vaccination theories have created a public health emergency. Social media has made spreading these ideas incredibly easy, leading to a reckoning for companies like Facebook and Google. But conspiracies are entertainment, too \u2014 one of the summer\u2019s biggest internet memes was a plot to storm Area 51 and \u201csee them aliens.\u201d And Hwang thinks exploring the creative side of conspiracism can help us understand its dangers.\n\n\u201cThe origin of this project was a conversation with a friend of mine. We were talking about how nowadays we live in a real world of conspiracy theories,\u201d says Hwang, formerly Google\u2019s AI policy head and the director of Harvard and MIT\u2019s Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative. \u201cI think one of the biggest challenges is thinking about, \u2018okay, how do we understand what they are and how they spread?\u2019 And I\u2019m always one to learn in a hands-on sort of way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe live in a real world of conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nWhen I spoke with Hwang last week, he\u2019d recruited around two dozen NaCoWriMo participants to create \u201cconspiracy kits.\u201d Each kit starts with a Revelation: a 10,000-word document outlining the basis of the theory and its potentially sinister implications for society. To explain the conspiracy, theorists need a Chart: a visual guide that makes their theory \u201cso obvious that it becomes surprising that no one has ever seen it before.\u201d To back it all up, they\u2019ll assemble the Clues: \u201ca corpus of curious facts\u201d for future theorists to examine.\n\nHwang isn\u2019t revealing participants\u2019 plans, but he says they reflect the diverse nature of real-world conspiracies, including the ways they\u2019re constructed. Some people are building on existing theories, while others are working from scratch. Some start with a premise like \u201call world leaders are alien lizard people,\u201d then find evidence to back it up. Others find a topic and pick out strange, suggestive connections, waiting for a pattern to emerge.\n\nNaCoWriMo needs to avoid a \u201c\u2018Foucault\u2019s Pendulum\u2019 situation\u201d\n\nNaCoWriMo is designed to explore the point where logic goes haywire, so a lot of these links will be fanciful \u2014 Hwang, for example, plans to expose mysterious ties between American politics and Wrestlemania. (Given Trump\u2019s history in pro wrestling, it\u2019s not as far-fetched as it sounds.) But the project also raises a strange possibility: what if somebody uncovers a real conspiracy?\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s this broad gray area that you explore once you really get into the business of trying to work on this,\u201d says Hwang. \u201cI\u2019m hoping we have conspiracies that are across the map \u2014 ones that are patently absurd and ones that are just on the edge. That are just sort of \u2018Hey, I did some investigation and this seems like a weird connection... but if you keep digging, it kind of seems like this might be true.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a darker alternative, too: what if a fake NaCoWriMo theory gains a real-life following? Hwang jokingly acknowledges the risk of a \u201cFoucault\u2019s Pendulum situation\u201d \u2014 referring to the 1988 Umberto Eco novel, where a handful of occult enthusiasts construct a story about secret societies for fun, only to see their made-up plot become real. In fact, some actual conspiracy groups, like flat-earthers, blur the line between ironic joke, earnest movement, and bizarre entertainment phenomenon. Many people even speculate that the deadly serious QAnon theory started as a prank.\n\n\u201cThere are people interested in learning about conspiracy theories as a way of subverting conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nNaCoWriMo\u2019s goal is dissecting \u201cconspiracy genre\u201d narrative tricks, not fooling readers. \u201cOne of the intriguing intellectual challenges of all this is \u2018How can you do this in a way that seems good?\u2019\u201d says Hwang. \u201cConspiracy theories have a lot of dark purposes and have motivated a lot of bad action. And I think there are people interested in learning about conspiracy theories as a way of subverting conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nAs sociologist Ted Goertzel told The Verge last year, though, one goal of real conspiracy theorists is \u201cto prove that nothing is provable, that all assertions are arbitrary.\u201d Creating an arbitrary conspiracy theory doesn\u2019t necessarily subvert that goal. And people often don\u2019t believe conspiracy theories for rational reasons \u2014 they just want to feel like the world makes sense.\n\nPolitics professors Russell Muirhead and Nancy Rosenblum even argue that the \u201cclassic\u201d conspiracy model, with its charts and obsessive research, barely applies to modern theories like QAnon and Pizzagate. In their recent book A Lot of People Are Saying, Muirhead and Rosenblum describe a \u201cnew conspiracism\u201d that relies on innuendo and wish fulfillment \u2014 in other words, \u201cconspiracy without any theory.\u201d\n\nThat won\u2019t fly during NaCoWriMo. \u201cIn some ways, we may be quite old-fashioned, in that the hope is that there\u2019s some legwork that goes on here,\u201d says Hwang. \u201cWhen you get midway through the month, you should be like, \u2018ugh, I don\u2019t know if I can keep going on this thing.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhatever its real-world effects, NaCoWriMo is an intriguing fiction challenge. Hwang welcomes people who want to write a NaNoWriMo novel about their conspiracy kit \u2014 or even write code that will generate a conspiracy theory, true to the spirit of spinoff movement NaNoGenMo.\n\nUltimately, Hwang thinks of conspiracies as an extension of our natural pattern-finding impulses \u2014 not just a political enterprise, but part of the same basic human urge that produces pareidolia and TV fan theories. \u201cI think actually what\u2019s interesting is that the origin of it is investigation, it\u2019s trying to connect dots. And in a lot of cases, we really admire people who are able to find connections between things that other people have not seen before,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018Conspiracy theory\u2019 has a certain kind of baggage about politics and sinister doings and smoke-filed rooms. But I think in some ways, the cognitive exercise of it has a lot of parallels with a lot of things.\u201d", "description": "National Conspiracy Writing Month or NaCoWriMo is an unofficial offshoot of National Novel Writing Month, challenging participants to create a viable conspiracy theory in 30 days.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GjhWRDmDlg9MOrtsMtuedRXWyTQ=/0x274:3742x2233/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19316985/629534017.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
