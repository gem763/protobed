The US has also reduced some military spending in Europe to finance, such as the border separation wall with Mexico.\n\nIn 2014, NATO members agreed to increase military spending to 2% of their gross domestic product by 2024.\n\nThe Dutch military spending has increased by 25% since 2014, but still only reached 1.2% of GDP last year. The Rutte government plans to further increase defense spending in the coming years. \"But we have to be honest, that we won't reach 2% by 2024,\" Rutte said.\n\nSome analysts and leaders wonder if it is not time to bury NATO. To put pressure on his partners, Trump declared last year that \"he may be outdated\".\n\nThe US is the country that contributes most to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with 22% of direct contributions.
