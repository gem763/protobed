Some of those breaks happened because Samsung didn\u2019t warn reviewers that a \u201cprotective layer\u201d that looks exactly like a removable screen protector is not removable at all, but instead it\u2019s a \u201cpart of the display structure.\u201d\n\nAt least two outlets \u2014 The Verge and CNBC \u2014 had review units with similarly catastrophic results but much more mysterious causes. I still don\u2019t know how I got the bulge in my first Fold\u2019s hinge that ultimately destroyed its flexible OLED panel, but it happened.\n\nAs of this writing, Samsung hasn\u2019t said what the cause might be. And since I and the journalists at CNBC returned the broken units to Samsung so we could get replacements, we\u2019re waiting on Samsung to offer up an explanation.\n\nUpdate: at 10:00AM ET on Monday, April 22nd, three days after the original publication of this review, Samsung announced that it is indefinitely delaying the release of the Galaxy Fold. There may even be design changes in the works to improve the durability of the screen. The rest of our review follows as is. Instead of looking at it in the spirit of reviewing it \u201cas if\u201d the screen issue was resolved, consider it now a review \u201cas if\u201d it had been released to the public in the same form that I reviewed it. We will, of course, re-review the device after Samsung tells us what, if any, changes it is making to the design.\n\nI\u2019ll just say it right out front: I cannot recommend that anybody buy this thing until we know what\u2019s up with these broken screens. The whole situation isn\u2019t quite the fiasco of exploding Note 7 smartphones, as nobody\u2019s safety is threatened, but it is, well, weird.\n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do: review the Galaxy Fold as if this whole terrible screen breaking thing will get resolved. Don\u2019t take that to mean that I think it absolutely will be or that I think you should dismiss these problems. Entirely the opposite: you should not buy this phone until we get more information \u2014 and even then, it\u2019s not a great purchase.\n\nBut there\u2019s enough to say about this device, its foibles, and the future it promises that I want to tell you about it. Because the other weird thing about the Galaxy Fold is this:\n\nI have never used a device with this many problems that I have liked this much.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Fold essentially takes the recent Galaxy S10 Plus and turns it into a platform for a wild new kind of device. It has a flexible 7.3-inch OLED screen that folds up, with a second little screen on the outside. The result is a tiny Android tablet that folds up into phone that\u2019s much smaller than a tablet \u2014 albeit much thicker.\n\nBecause it\u2019s a new kind of device, there are a thousand things to talk about, the kinds of things that we don\u2019t usually need to address when we\u2019re talking about plain old smartphones. Which way does the screen fold? Is plastic really durable enough? Is there a gap when it\u2019s folded? Is it too heavy? What is the hinge mechanism like? How does the software translate from a small screen to a big screen? Is there a visible crease in the screen? If there is a crease, how noticeable is it, and should we be forgiving of it in the same way we forgive notches?\n\nThe more important questions to answer are different. Is a foldable phone fundamentally different than either a phone or a tablet? Does it help you get more done or have more fun or \u2014 maybe \u2014 help foster a healthier relationship between you and your gadget? Ultimately, is a folding phone better in some tangible way than a regular phone?\n\nI\u2019ll try to answer as many of those questions as I can, but I can only gesture at some of them. What I can definitively say is that at $1,980 and with a cloud hanging over the Fold\u2019s reliability, you should not buy it.\n\nThe Galaxy Fold is also beset with issues that stack up into a pile that you can\u2019t excuse away by saying this is just a first-generation product. There are basic user experience issues that are unacceptable on any smartphone, much less one that costs two grand.\n\nWhat you should do is head to a store and play around with it because it is legitimately a marvelous thing to play with. Beyond that, it\u2019s a status symbol, a curiosity, and a little tease at a possible future.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the main screen, the big one on the inside that folds. On an objective basis, using the same standards we apply to any smartphone, the screen on the Galaxy Fold is bad. And that is wild to say because, again, subjectively, I deeply enjoy using it.\n\nThe biggest issue everybody wants to know about is the crease. There\u2019s just no pretending that it isn\u2019t there or that you don\u2019t see it or feel it when you run your finger across it. Especially when you\u2019re looking at it from an angle, it\u2019s just a really obvious line through the middle of the screen. What\u2019s worse, it\u2019s a really obvious line that has two different color temperatures on either side of it when you look at it from an angle.\n\nThe crease is nearly invisible when you look straight at it, but it\u2019s clearly visible at an angle\n\nBut when you start using the Fold, it tends to disappear. I stopped seeing it; it is actually difficult to spot when you\u2019re looking at the Fold straight-on, which means that my subjective experience is just that it\u2019s a great little 7-inch tablet. The screen is just slightly smaller than the iPad mini\u2019s, but the Galaxy Fold has radically smaller bezels.\n\nIf that were the whole story, I\u2019d tell you that the crease is a sort of modern version of the notch: a thing that is annoying but ultimately something you can get used to. I could tell you that it\u2019s one of the things that is just going to happen on a folding phone, then move on to say that the colors are super vivid, the text is sharp, and it gets plenty bright.\n\nBut I can\u2019t tell you that because the crease is just the start of this screen\u2019s issues. I am sympathetic to the argument that one of the first folding smartphone screens should be judged differently than the screen on a top-tier smartphone like an iPhone or regular Galaxy S phone. But even if you lower or change the bar, you really can\u2019t paper over the rest of the problems with this screen.\n\nThe blunt fact of the Galaxy Fold\u2019s main screen is that it\u2019s made of plastic and covered over with that thick, polymer layer. It isn\u2019t as smooth as glass, and it\u2019s nowhere near as hard. My second review unit has a little \u201cdimple\u201d in one spot, and in just a couple days of use, it has picked up a half-dozen little nicks.\n\nThose flaws are hard to see when the screen is on, but I shudder to think what this plastic layer is going to look like in a month, six months, or a couple of years. I\u2019ve asked Samsung if it plans to have some sort of extended warranty program to replace that screen protector thing, but it doesn\u2019t have a comment on that. Here\u2019s my suggestion: every Fold owner should be able to get that plastic layer replaced by Samsung on a regular basis. (And, no, do not try to peel it off yourself.)\n\nAlthough Samsung wouldn\u2019t comment on most of the questions I\u2019ve been asking in the course of doing this review, it did have a statement about the dings and nicks on the screen.\n\nThe main display of the Galaxy Fold is made with a new, advanced polymer layer and adhesive that\u2019s flexible and tough enough to endure repeated folding actions with an extra protective layer to guard against impact. The protective layer is susceptible to blemishes and marks in certain circumstances, but they will not hinder your experience or the content you are viewing.\n\nI\u2019m not done. There\u2019s one more problem, one that I had hoped to never see again: the dreaded \u201cjelly scroll.\u201d One side of the screen scrolls faster than the other side. I think it\u2019s because, unlike with most other phones, the guts that run the screen are probably on the side instead of on the top or bottom. It\u2019s the sort of thing you won\u2019t notice until it\u2019s pointed out to you. Then you notice it. Then you can\u2019t not see it.\n\nAnother thing that\u2019s hard to unsee is the notch at the top right of the screen that houses the cameras. It\u2019s really big. That\u2019s fine when you\u2019re just reading or browsing around on the internet, but it\u2019s terrible when you\u2019re watching video. YouTube, Netflix, and HBO Now all get cut off by the notch. The only fix is to dig way into the Fold\u2019s settings to find the checkbox that hides the entire top bar of the phone. It works, but it means you lose a bunch of screen real estate as the status bar gets pushed down.\n\nThe screen picks up dings, has a bad jelly effect on scrolling, and many mechanical points of failure \u2014 but it\u2019s still enjoyable to use\n\nEven if you\u2019re willing to forgive all of that (and you really shouldn\u2019t), there are still a lot of moving parts. Literally: the hinge behind the screen; the bending of the screen itself; the fact that there are tiny gaps right at the bend point where debris could get in underneath the screen and damage it; the weird plastic rail that serves as a bezel and holds the whole thing down, under which the screen probably needs to be able to move just a little.\n\nThose are all potential points of failure. One of those things might have been the root cause of what broke the screen on my original review unit.\n\nAnd yet, using the Galaxy Fold in tablet mode is a joy. It\u2019s great to have a huge screen for watching videos and reading. You can get real tabs in your browser, across the top where they belong. You can get a full three-column layout in Gmail. Plus, this might actually be my favorite Kindle book reading device \u2014 and I own a top-flight Kindle Oasis. You can rotate it sideways and get two columns of text, and you get all of the Android app features that work better with a real touchscreen than they do on a traditional Kindle.\n\nThe screen is terrible, but quite often, using the screen is wonderful.\n\nIf this were a traditional phone, we\u2019d be spending a lot of time talking about the standard stuff you talk about with phones: the speed, the specs, the cameras, and so on. The bottom line for all of that on the Galaxy Fold is that it performs very well. It\u2019s fast, it has a ton of storage, and it has remarkably good battery life. It also takes very good photos.\n\nThat\u2019s because the core guts of the phone are very nearly the same as the Galaxy S10 Plus. It has a Snapdragon 855 processor, 12GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. I have had zero problems with performance, and I have been able to get as many as five app windows open at the same time \u2014 likely thanks to that capacious RAM. Gaming works great, too: I could hold 30 fps in Fortnite with pretty aggressive graphics settings.\n\nIn terms of pure specs, the Galaxy Fold holds up \u2014 especially on battery life\n\nThere are six cameras. On the back is a wide, regular, and telephoto lens. The selfie camera on the front is the same as the Galaxy S10, and the dual-selfie cameras inside are the same as the S10 Plus. What all that really means is that your photos will be very good, but not quite as good as what you\u2019ll get on a Pixel 3 or Huawei P30 Pro.\n\nOne spec I am super impressed by is battery life. The Fold has a 4,380mAh battery, and it just lasts. My screen time has been well over eight hours pretty much every day, and I haven\u2019t been bothering to ratchet down the screen brightness. Tablets generally have great battery life, and the Galaxy Fold is better thought of as a tablet that folds than a phone that unfolds.\n\nThere\u2019s wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, and a USB-C port. There is no headphone jack. There are two speakers, and they sound good and get loud, but they\u2019re super easy to muffle with your palms when you hold the Fold in landscape mode to watch a video.\n\nAll of the buttons are on the right side, including the fingerprint sensor. Once it\u2019s set up, the fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate. But instead of living on the power button, it lives on the Bixby button. So I ended up accidentally triggering the somewhat-useless Bixby Assistant a bunch of times, and it did make me wonder if that was exactly Samsung\u2019s goal.\n\nIn terms of overall build quality, well, what can I say? Before my first unit broke, I thought that the hinge felt remarkably solid. I wish there was some kind of waterproofing, but I get that it would be really hard to do. Until we know more about why at least two of the review units out in the world broke, we have to call build quality a huge question mark.\n\nAs a physical object, there\u2019s no getting around the fact that this thing is pretty awkward. When folded, it\u2019s super tall and super skinny, more like a remote control than a phone. It\u2019s also really thick. Lots of people have made the joke that this feels like two phones taped together, and they\u2019re not wrong. The thickness is not helped by the fact that there\u2019s an \u201cair gap\u201d by the hinge because it can\u2019t fold completely flat.\n\nIt\u2019s so tall and so thick that fitting it into a pants pocket is awkward. And if you have smaller pockets, forget about it. You will want to put it in a purse or jacket pocket or just carry it around everywhere.\n\nWhen the Fold is closed, you can use a tiny 4.6-inch screen on the front that sits weirdly in the middle of the device and is surrounded by giant bezels. It might sound strange to say that 4.6 inches is \u201ctiny,\u201d but that\u2019s the diagonal measurement. The reality is that it\u2019s a bad measurement for such a tall, narrow screen. (Ask Pythagoras.)\n\nThe front screen is so narrow that it\u2019s nearly impossible to type on. I should also note that it uses an entirely different home screen layout than the main home screen (though it shares the organization of your app drawer).\n\nThat turns out to be a huge boon because, practically speaking, you should think of that front screen like a superpowered lock screen. I just put the apps I use during my commute on it, including Spotify, Google Maps, and Holedown. I\u2019ll dismiss notifications and do little tasks, but for anything more serious than that, you\u2019ll want to open the phone up and use the main display.\n\nOverall, the software is better than I expected, but I didn\u2019t expect a lot. Android has never been great on tablets, but Samsung\u2019s One UI helps. The big new thing is a feature called App Continuity. If you have an app open on the tiny front screen, it will be right there on the big screen when you unfold it, fully resized. It\u2019s based on the work Google is doing to make Android apps resizable on Chromebooks and tablets, but not all apps support it. Sometimes you get black bars on the big screen, and you\u2019ll have to relaunch the app to fix it.\n\nResizable apps also let Samsung do its multitasking trick, which amounts to a split-screen mode with an option to tile a third window. To enable it, you can swipe over from the right to pull up a recently used list of apps and select one to open on a split screen. When you do that, there\u2019s a little bar at the top of each app, which turns blue to indicate which app has the focus for typing. You can drag the divider to change the size of each of the two apps.\n\nThen you can open a third app on the right by repeating the same action. Grabbing those little bars lets you rearrange which app is in which tile, but that two- or three-up layout is all you get. It works better than previous Android windowing systems I\u2019ve used, but that\u2019s not saying much. And even on a 7.3-inch screen, it feels really crowded.\n\nIf you really want them, all of the wackadoo multiscreen options from Samsung\u2019s One UI interface are still here. You can tap on that bar and pop out the app into a little resizable window, which can also collapse into a floating icon that you can put anywhere on the screen. It\u2019s neat if you have a messaging app you always want to be quickly available.\n\nAll of this is fine, but it\u2019s also kind of confusing. It\u2019s definitely less elegant than the relatively simple split-screen-plus-slide-over system the iPad uses. What\u2019s more, if you close the tablet, all of those tiled windows go away, and you lose the state of your workspace. Hopefully, the promised changes coming in Android Q will fix some of this (and hopefully, Samsung will actually update the Fold with that software in a timely manner).\n\nI think that the vast majority of people who get this will use one app at a time on the main screen and be happy about having a big screen.\n\nAll this week, I kept coming back to a thought about how we use our phones. We pull them out to check something quickly, but then, all of a sudden, a half-hour disappears scrolling Instagram or Twitter or whatever. It\u2019s a real problem.\n\nBut it\u2019s a problem I didn\u2019t really have with the Galaxy Fold. When I was using the tiny screen, I just wanted to get something done quickly and put it away because the screen was small, and I wasn\u2019t in a place where I wanted to unfold it.\n\nOn the flip side, when I was using Galaxy Fold unfolded, I was really using it. I had to hold it in two hands, and it felt much more like using a tablet, an active device I was choosing to use. It requires some small measure of intentionality \u2014 more than a phone, anyway.\n\nI found myself using it in meetings, and nobody batted an eye. I was reviewing docs for the meeting, but I could have just as easily been messing around on social media. But think about the social rules of a work meeting: somebody messing around on their phone is a jerk, but somebody using a tablet is more likely to be doing something relevant. The Fold feels like a different device with different social rules, and that\u2019s fascinating.\n\nPhones are funny things. They fit into our in-between times when you\u2019re waiting in line or you have a minute to glance at something. But then they fill up all of those moments \u2014 and much more. The Galaxy Fold is just too big to fit in those in-between times. It is less useful than a phone when you\u2019re walking, and it\u2019s way more useful when you\u2019re sitting down. I ended up feeling better about how I was using this than I usually do with a regular phone.\n\nIs that worth two thousand bucks? Is it worth all of the compromises and first-generation problems you run into with this device? Is it worth the risk of buying a phone whose screen might be so fragile that it could break at any minute if a piece of debris gets in between it and the hinge? No, it is not.\n\nBut it is worth thinking about. Even though I would never buy the Galaxy Fold and wouldn\u2019t recommend anybody else does either, I\u2019m going to keep thinking about it. Because there might be the start of something really new here, something really different.\n\nI just wish it wasn\u2019t also something really broken.\n\nVox Media has affiliate partnerships.
