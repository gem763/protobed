Our product allows ordinary users to invest and make their money appreciate over time, instead of leaving it dormant in a bank and accruing interest at rates equal to or below inflation.\u201d\n\nBitrue users will be able to gain up to 10.3% interest on a wide variety of coins, including Bitcoin (BTC), XRP (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT) and more. The amount that can be invested is proportional to the amount of Bitrue Token (BTR) held, providing a further use case for this platform token.\n\n\u201cOur Power Piggy program, which allows the community to compete for investment opportunities, has been a runaway success and has attracted a lot of attention in the industry. We now find ourselves in a unique position to bring this opportunity to the loyal customers who are supporting us long term by holding BTR.\u201d\n\nBitrue plans to continue developing innovative products and services that link the traditional financial markets with the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry. Further features will continue to be developed around Bitrue Token (BTR), such as reduced interest rates on the recently launched \u200bBitrue Loans\u200b feature and increased weighting when receiving airdrops.\n\nMore details about VIP Caps can be found at the \u200bofficial announcement page\u200b.\n\nAbout Bitrue\n\nBitrue is a growing cryptocurrency exchange and digital asset management service that is disrupting the industry by adapting traditional financial services to the newly emerging crypto markets.
