(Rich Pedroncelli)\n\nGregory Cheadle went to a Trump rally out of curiosity and left it as an international headline.\n\nThe infamous moment, like many at Donald Trump\u2019s rallies that summer in 2016, seemed to materialize out of nowhere. Trump was telling a story about an African American supporter when suddenly he spotted Cheadle in the front row at the Redding, Calif. event, and paused to single out the black man.\n\n\u201cOh, look at my African American over here!\u201d Trump exclaimed, pointing at Cheadle. \u201cLook at him! Are you the greatest?\u201d\n\nCheadle laughed at Trump\u2019s outburst then.\n\nNow, citing the president\u2019s \u201cwhite superiority complex,\u201d Cheadle isn\u2019t in the same party anymore.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cheadle revealed he has abandoned the GOP to launch a bid for Congress as an Independent in California\u2019s 1st Congressional District, saying he\u2019s had enough of Republicans\u2019 failure to condemn Trump\u2019s comments denigrating black people. Cheadle doesn\u2019t identify any one moment as his breaking point, but rather a deflating succession of them. Somewhere between Trump\u2019s feud with former NFL star Colin Kaepernick and his attacks on Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), between his \u201cshithole countries\u201d comment and his \u201cgo back\u201d tweets, \u201cI said, enough is enough. I\u2019m sick of it.\"\n\n\u201cI just hope this is a wake-up call for the GOP,\u201d Cheadle, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress four times as a Republican, told The Washington Post. \u201cThe GOP is going to be in the Smithsonian the way they\u2019re going. Their only concern is for whites. They don\u2019t care about the poor. They don\u2019t care about anybody else.\"\n\nTrump responded to Cheadle\u2019s comments on Thursday by claiming he didn\u2019t know who Cheadle was, according to PBS NewsHour, which first reported Cheadle\u2019s decion. When a PBS reporter pressed Trump on the White House lawn about Cheadle\u2019s claim that the president is pursuing a \u201cpro-white\u201d agenda, Trump touted his backing from black voters.\n\n\u201cWe have tremendous African American support,\u201d Trump told PBS NewsHour. \u201cI would say I\u2019m at my all-time high. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had the support that I have now. I think I\u2019m going to do very well with African Americans. African American support has been the best we\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nHis approval rating among African American voters is at 10 percent, according to the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll. A July 30 Quinnipiac University poll found that 80 percent of African American voters believe Trump is a racist \u2014 a result that came on the heels of numerous explosive racial comments from Trump that month.\n\n[How a racist tweet became a Trump rally chant in three short days]\n\nOn July 14, he suggested that four minority congresswomen \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they came from, then shortly afterward stood by while a crowd at his rally chanted \u201cSend her back!\u201d referring to Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), a Somali refugee and naturalized citizen. Two weeks later he called Baltimore \u201crodent-infested\u201d and said people there were \u201cliving in hell,\u201d claiming Cummings had done nothing to help them. The attacks were largely condemned as racist.\n\n\u201cVery few Republicans spoke out, and that\u2019s part of the problem,\u201d Cheadle said. \u201cI just found myself in amazement with the GOP just remaining silent when this was just so wrong. These things are wrong. I\u2019m tired of blacks being denigrated and disrespected. I\u2019m sick of it. And the GOP has done an excellent job of fueling my disgust by the way they have been treating us.\u201d\n\nCheadle, who joined the GOP in 2001, said that he voted for Trump in the general election but never really saw himself as a big MAGA guy. He didn\u2019t even consider himself a Trump supporter the day he went to Trump\u2019s 2016 rally. He just wanted to see what the reality-television star had to say \u2014 only to become a part of Trump\u2019s campaign news. It was yet another moment critics described as evidence of Trump\u2019s racism, coming just after with Trump\u2019s attack on a Mexican American judge for his race.\n\n\u201c#TrumpsAfricanAmerican\u201d started trending and Cheadle started getting hate mail. He came forward to NPR to explain that actually he was not a Trump fan, as the then-candidate had assumed, but that he also was not offended by Trump\u2019s comment, seeing it as a lighthearted moment easy to laugh off with the rest of the crowd.\n\nHe still sees it that way, he said Thursday. \u201cThe only difference now, though, is I question his motivation for making that statement,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 62-year-old real estate broker said he\u2019s been frustrated by Trump\u2019s tendency to exaggerate his support among black voters. Trump has frequently touted criminal justice reform and black unemployment numbers (while also attacking black celebrities for not giving him enough credit). But Cheadle said he was bothered by the Trump administration\u2019s plan to cut back food stamps, a policy that he said will only make \u201cthe poor poorer and the rich richer.\u201d\n\nHe also worried about the dearth of diversity in Trump\u2019s judicial appointments, fearing the federal courts would become full of \u201cwhite guys who have no interactions with blacks whatsoever, their minds set to stereotype us.\u201d A recent NPR analysis found 87 percent of Trump\u2019s nominees are white.\n\nCheadle said bringing awareness to the plight of black people is his priority in his run for Congress, focusing on issues including prison reform and improving the public school system. His online platform also features a hard-line immigration stance, including stripping undocumented immigrants of non-emergency medical care and access to public school.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I will have to revisit,\u201d he said on Thursday when asked about the measures.\n\nHe\u2019ll face incumbent Rep.
