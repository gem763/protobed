To that, Kilmeade responded: \u201cAbandon our allies? That\u2019s a campaign promise?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll we did is arm them and they did all the work. And now we say, \u2019Good luck. Good luck surviving,\u2019\u201d said Kilmeade. \u201cDisaster.\u201d\n\nBrian Kilmeade fights with his co-hosts over Trump throwing Syrian Kurds under the bus: \"What kind of message is that to the next ally that wants to side with us? ...

The announcement led Jim Mattis to resign as defense secretary and then-national security adviser John Bolton to take steps attempting to protect the Kurds.\n\nTrump\u2019s new decision to abandon the Kurds has already sparked backlash beyond Fox News. A Syria Kurdish official told NBC that \u201cthe Americans are traitors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have abandoned us to a Turkish massacre. We can no longer fight against ISIS and have to defend ourselves. This could allow ISIS to return to the region,\u201d the official said.\n\nAlso on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Trump\u2019s decision compromises America\u2019s promise to allies.\n\n\u201cThe thing I believe is if you make a commitment and someone is fighting with you, America should keep its word,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nSen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) also called into the show to say that Trump\u2019s \u201cimpulsive\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d decision to abandon the Kurds has \u201cundone all the gains we\u2019ve made\u201d and \u201cthrown the region into further chaos.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m an ISIS fighter, I\u2019ve got a second lease on life,\u201d said Graham, normally one of the president\u2019s most vigorous defenders. \u201cTo those who think ISIS has been defeated, you will soon see.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI like President Trump. I\u2019ve tried to help him. This to me is just unnerving to its core. To say to the American people, \u2019ISIS has been destroyed in Syria\u2019 is not true.\u201d\n\nLindsey Graham calls in to Fox & Friends & calls Trump's decision to abandon the Kurds \"impulsive.\"\n\n\n\n\"I hope I'm making myself clear how shortsighted & irresponsible this decision is in my view,\" he says. \"This to me is just unnerving to its core.\" pic.twitter.com/URH0DVA1bo \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 7, 2019\n\nDespite the criticism, Trump doubled down with a series of tweets.\n\n\u201cThe United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cWe stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight.\u201d\n\nHe went on: \u201cThe Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so. ... it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home. WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN.\u201d\n\nHe added in another tweet: \u201cWe are 7000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us!\u201d\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
