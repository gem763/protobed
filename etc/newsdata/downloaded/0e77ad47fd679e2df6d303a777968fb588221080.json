(TSX.V: XLY) (OTCQX: CBWTF) (\u201cAuxly\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) today announced that, further to the Company's October 18, 2019 press release, certain holders of the Company's remaining 6% unsecured convertible debentures in the principal amount of $98,690,000 maturing on January 16, 2020 (the \"Debentures\") elected to either convert or amend their Debentures, resulting in $95,425,001 of the principal amount of the Debentures being settled and reducing Auxly\u2019s interest expense by approximately $1.25 million through: (i) the repayment of $79,439,174 of debt; and (ii) the conversion of $15,985,826 into 21,602,460 common shares of the Company at the price of $0.74 per share.\n\n\u201cThe successful repayment of the majority of the Debentures has strengthened our balance sheet and effectively left Auxly with no long-term debt payable for the next three years,\u201d said Hugo Alves, CEO of Auxly. \u201cThe additional funding received from the partial conversion of the Debentures further strengthens Auxly's financial position as we continue to execute on the roll-out of our \u2018cannabis 2.0\u2019 derivative product portfolio later this year. We are counting down the weeks until our branded cannabis products are available to Canadian consumers!\u201d\n\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD\n\n\"Hugo Alves\" CEO\n\nAbout Auxly Cannabis Group Inc.
