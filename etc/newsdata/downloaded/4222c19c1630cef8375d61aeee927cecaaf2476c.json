Honestly, the hypocrisy that comes from these people,\u2019 Piers began.\n\n\u2018They went to McDonald\u2019s to eat mass produced meat out of cardboard boxes. Maybe they\u2019re not having a veggie burger, maybe they\u2019re shameless hypocrites going to the epicentre of fast food.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018How does McDonald\u2019s sit with their eco-warrior \u2013 I mean seriously, how does it sit with it?\u2019 he wondered.\n\nAfter being challenged by Susanna, Piers claimed he\u2019s \u2018doing a lot\u2019 for climate change but his co-host celebrated Greta and the protestors for raising awareness about the issue.\n\nThat prompted Piers to launch into a ruthless impersonation of Greta, crying out: \u2018How dare you? You stole my airtime.\u2019\n\nOh, Piers.\n\nPiers\u2019 impression of Greta was quite something (Picture: ITV/Rex; Reuters)\n\nContinuing his rant, Piers said of the protestors: \u2018They went down and defaced the famous horse with their stupid signs and stuff. We all want to save the planet. I\u2019m not lying down on the floor, defacing the white horse, paralysing traffic in London for two weeks and genuinely behaving like a total imbecile. That\u2019s not how you affect change.\n\n\u2018They hate them for the destruction they\u2019re causing, they hate them for the smell.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018They\u2019re making it personal to us, they\u2019re saying we\u2019re gas-guzzling horrible people and there they are nipping off to McDonald\u2019s. Shameless hypocrites.\n\n\u2018They\u2019ll probably be down at Glastonbury won\u2019t they for three weeks. This is the latest jolly.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d be sick too if I hadn\u2019t washed for two weeks.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
