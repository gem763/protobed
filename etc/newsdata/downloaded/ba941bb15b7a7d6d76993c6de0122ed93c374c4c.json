Tear gas was fired as some demonstrators and police clashed in the early hours.\n\nFires lit in the street in central Beirut were smouldering on Friday morning. Pavements were scattered with the glass of several smashed shop-fronts and billboards had been torn down.\n\nProtesters blocked roads in the north, the south and the Bekaa Valley, among other areas, the National News Agency (NNA) reported. Schools were closed on the instructions of the government.\n\n\"We are one people united against the state. We want it to fall,\" a protester in the town of Jeita, 15 km (9 miles) said. \"Revolution, revolution!\" they chanted.\n\nTwo foreign workers choked to death from a fire that spread to a building near the protests in Beirut, the NNA said.\n\nThis was the second wave of nationwide protests this month.\n\nIn a country fractured along sectarian lines, the unusually wide geographic reach of these protests has been seen as a sign of deepening anger with politicians who have jointly led Lebanon into crisis.\n\nThe government, which includes nearly all of Lebanon's main parties, is struggling to implement long-delayed reforms that are seen as more vital than ever to begin resolving the crisis.\n\nThe Lebanese newspaper an-Nahar described it as \"a tax intifada\", or uprising, across Lebanon. Another daily, al-Akhbar, declared it \"the WhatsApp revolution\" that had shaken Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri's unity government.\n\n\n\n\n\nELUSIVE REFORMS\n\nSeeking ways to boost revenues, a government minister on Thursday announced plans to raise a new fee of 20 cents per day for calls via voice over internet protocol (VoIP), used by applications including Facebook-owned WhatsApp.\n\nBut as the protests spread, Telecoms Minister Mohamed Choucair phoned into Lebanese broadcasters on Thursday evening to say the proposed levy on WhatsApp calls had been revoked.\n\nShattered by war between 1975 and 1990, Lebanon has one of the world's highest debt burdens as a share of its economy. Economic growth has been hit by regional conflict and instability. Unemployment among those aged under 35 runs at 37%.\n\nThe kind of steps needed to fix the national finances have long proven elusive. Sectarian politicians, many of them civil war veterans, have long used state resources for their own political benefit and are reluctant to cede prerogatives.\n\nThe crisis has been compounded by a slowdown in capital flows to Lebanon, which has long depended on remittances from its diaspora to meet financing needs, including the state's deficit.\n\nThe financial crunch has added to the impetus for reform but the government's steps have yet to convince foreign donors who have offered billions in financial assistance conditional on changes.\n\nThe strains have emerged recently in the real economy where importers have been unable to secure dollars at the pegged exchange rate.\n\nThe cabinet is due to meet on Friday at the presidential palace in Baabda in what a minister has said would be the final session to discuss the 2020 state budget.
