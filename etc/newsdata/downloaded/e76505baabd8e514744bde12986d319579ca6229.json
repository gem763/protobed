All of American basketball, from high school to college to the pros, they all answer to Nike.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of the democracy movement in Hong Kong, where for weeks protesters have been clashing with police and one was shot. In the fallout of an angry response from the Chinese government and the state-run basketball league, Morey deleted that tweet and in subsequent posts walked back his view to a more nuanced position but the rift was already made between the NBA and China.\n\nChina is a huge market for the NBA, arguably the largest overseas audience for basketball, and the criticism is that the league caved into pressure over Morey\u2019s tweet. Whitlock is a co-host of \u201cSpeak for Yourself\u201d on Fox Sports 1 and has been a frequent critic of the NBA\u2019s handling of the Morey's tweet.\n\nIt\u2019s a story about really Nike, its dependence on the Chinese market, its dependence on Asian market. Nike dictates \u2013 Nike is a $40 billion a year business and the NBA is an $8 billion a year business. Nike is the one telling the NBA we can\u2019t get crossways with the Chinese government and we will acquiesce. And we will shut up, dribble and obey. - Jason Whitlock, FOX Sports 1 analyst\n\nThe world\u2019s largest nation isn\u2019t just a huge market for the NBA but also for Nike. The apparel and sneaker company wields tremendous influence on the league and globally, something Whitlock said shouldn\u2019t be lost in all of this as Nike did a shade over $5 billion in sales in China last year.\n\n\u201cLook at Nike\u2019s history in Asia, look at how dependent it is on China as a market,\" Whitlock said. \"Every NBA player basically runs to China every offseason to collect money and tap into the shoe market in China. We beholden, and Nike is the leader of this \u2013 And Nike is a great American company - but are they answering to America or are they answering to China?\u201d\n\nIt all makes for a tense situation as several NBA teams are currently in China for preseason. The NBA has backpedaled on the issue, caving to China\u2019s pressure and issuing retractions and apologies. But it still isn\u2019t good enough.\n\nChinese television, for example, has canceled the broadcast of all NBA preseason games.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve handled it very well because they\u2019ve boxed themselves by promoting themselves as freedom fighters and social justice warriors,\u201d Whitlock said. \u201cAnd now the general manager of the Houston Rockets has actually supported people who are fighting for their freedom in Hong Kong and now the league has gone voiceless and the Chinese government has basically told everyone over there \u2018Shut up and dribble.\u2019 And they are complying, they shut up and dribbled the basketball this morning. Didn\u2019t talk to the press, aren\u2019t going to make a statement.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "FS1's Jason Whitlock says that Nike is pulling the strings on the NBA's response to China.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Daryl-Morey-.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
