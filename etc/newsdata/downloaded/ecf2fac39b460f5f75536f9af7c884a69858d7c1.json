The game, called \"Baseball's Next Level,\" allows players to play as MLB athletes who are each wearing their own limited-edition cleats from the Adidas 8-bit collection, which Snapchat users can then purchase directly within the game. The game is also available outside Snapchat on a microsite. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe shoppable game could help Adidas appeal to Snapchat's young user base, which tends to engage in both mobile gaming and social commerce:\n\nSocial commerce. Ninety percent of all 13-24 year-olds in the US use the app, according to Snap as of Q2 2019. In general, younger consumers are more interested in social shopping compared with their older counterparts \u2014 both for discovering and purchasing products. More than half (59%) of Gen Z shoppers ages 18-23 and 55% of millennials ages 24-37 say they often discover products through social media platforms, per ViSenze. Further, 44% of US internet users ages 18-34 say they've purchased products through social media \u2014 and another 28% of those who haven't are interested in doing so, per Bizrate Insights.\n\nMobile gaming. More than two-thirds (67%) of Americans \u2014 or about 211 million people \u2014 say they play video games, and of that group, 90% play games on a mobile device, per Electronic Entertainment Design and Research. Already, that gamers have shown appetite for making in-game purchases: For example, Fortnite, which generates all of its revenue through in-game purchases, grossed $3 billion in profit in 2018, per Sensor Tower. While Fortnite's purchases are for digital goods, like character \"skins\" \u2014 outfits for a gamer's avatar \u2014 Snapchat's shoppable game attempts to build on the behavior among gamers to inspire the purchase of real-world goods.\n\nThe game further indicates how mobile-first branded experiences will become increasingly immersive, entertaining, and interactive in order to drive conversions and retain users. Sponsored experiences built for mobile arguably need to be more engaging compared with other media environments because mobile users have total control over their screen and a moment's frustration could send them elsewhere: 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take more than 3 seconds to load, per Google.\n\nMore immersive, interactive ad experiences compel users to actively choose to engage with them, which likely makes them more effective compared with interstitial ads. Built-for-social sponsored experiences are likely to proliferate beyond Snapchat: Earlier this week, TikTok reportedly rolled out a new ad format called playable ads, which encourage downloads of a game or app by offering a playable preview, to ad buyers in East Asia, for instance. More of these experiences could begin to incorporate e-commerce functionality, especially as platforms look to both drive engagement and boost ROI for brands.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
