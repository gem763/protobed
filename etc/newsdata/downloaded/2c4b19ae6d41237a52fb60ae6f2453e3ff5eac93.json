The lawsuit argued that in 2014 Johnson was prescribed hormonal birth control despite tests showing she had a high risk of blood clots. It accused doctors of incorrectly documenting those test results.\n\nThe suit said Johnson went to urgent care a month later with various symptoms and was repeatedly misdiagnosed days before she died from a pulmonary embolism.\n\nThe family said in a statement through their attorneys that they hoped the suit would prevent similar situations from happening.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
