Considered a potential future captain of this side, Markram still averages a touch over 40 in the format and must be backed to find his best soon.\n\nDe Bruyn and Bavuma, however, do not have that luxury.\n\nBavuma may have been named Test vice-captain ahead of this tour, but he still needs to justify his selection with the bat and so far, that has not happened in India.\n\nDe Bruyn, meanwhile, continues his battle to get going in Test cricket and after 11 matches he averages a disappointing 18.95.\n\nWaiting in the wings is the highly-rated Zubayr Hamza, the 24-year-old Cape Cobras batsman who has just one Test to his name.\n\nWith the third Test a dead-rubber, the Proteas brains trust will be tempted to give Hamza a look-in, but they need to be careful about what such a selection could mean for whoever is left out.\n\nDe Bruyn is considered one of the most naturally gifted batsmen in the Proteas set-up by his team-mates, most of whom believe he is just one knock away from finding the confidence he needs to take his game to the next level.\n\nEver since he debuted in New Zealand back in 2017, De Bruyn has spent a lot of time on the sidelines having to be patient as the likes of Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers and Bavuma were backed in the middle order.\n\nWith Amla and De Villiers no longer, an opportunity has now presented itself for De Bruyn to be given an extended run in the South African Test set-up.\n\nIt would be foolish, then, to pull the plug on him just two Tests into the summer.\n\nI would argue that De Bruyn be given the last Test against India as well as all four against England at home over December and January. That way, he can bat with the freedom that comes with knowing that he isn't playing for his life every time he walks to the middle.\n\nThe hope is that, with that injection of faith, De Bruyn will start delivering on the potential he undoubtedly possesses.\n\nBavuma, meanwhile, has been in good touch in India in the weeks leading up to the Test series where he scored runs for South Africa 'A' and for the Proteas in a warm-up match against an Indian Presidents XI.\n\nThe fact that he has been given the vice-captaincy shows that he has become a core member of this Test side and, with Amla now gone, the South African middle order is crying out for experience.\n\nBavuma, with his leadership ability well documented, offers that.\n\nHe needs big runs soon, but leaving him out of the side at this crucial stage of renewal would be more damaging than anything to his long-term role in this side.\n\nInstead, if South Africa want to go with Hamza for the third Test, they might look at leaving out all-rounder Senuran Muthusamy.\n\nIt would be harsh given the grit Muthusamy showed with the bat on debut in Visakhapatnam, but are the Proteas really getting enough out of him with the ball to justify selection?\n\nIt is a decision that Nkwe and skipper Faf du Plessis will have to think long and hard about before Saturday.\n\nThe series may be lost for this struggling group, but there is still the opportunity for these players to deliver performances of substance, and right now nobody needs that more than De Bruyn and Bavuma.\n\nFollow @LloydBurnard on Twitter ...", "description": "The struggling middle order pair of Theunis de Bruyn and Temba Bavuma need to receive backing from the national selectors, writes Lloyd Burnard.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7928/838636115a32430e820fd47c4b7c2460.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
