She\u2019s very uncomfortable with her skin and wants to go about changing it. But then, a magical night through the night sky changes her mind and she learns how to love herself.\u201d\n\nNyong\u2019o put her own experiences in the book, including the nightly prayers she would say as a child for lighter skin.\n\n\u201cI would pray to God every night for lighter skin, because my mom told me God performs miracles. I thought, \u2018Oh, here\u2019s one for me. Give me some light skin,\u2019\u201d the star recalled.\n\n\u201cI had a younger sister who\u2019s much lighter,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery morning I\u2019d wake up and run to the mirror and see whether he\u2019d answered my prayer, and I\u2019d always be so disappointed.\u201d\n\nNyong\u2019o said Sulwe is a \u201cmirror\u201d for dark-skinned girls to be seen and a \u201cwindow\u201d for people who don\u2019t know about colorism to learn more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mirror for dark-skinned girls to see themselves, specifically because I didn\u2019t have that growing up. I wanted to kind of use the pain that I felt, for it to be my weapon, my gift,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also for other people who might not know, I hope this book is a window into understanding what people that may not be like you can go through. Ultimately, the message is that the most important thing is to love yourself before anything else.\u201d\n\nLater on in the show, Nyong\u2019o name-dropped Sulwe and celebrity couple Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z while rapping as her alter-ego, Troublemaker.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, Troublemaker came out to play with Jimmy & The Roots!\u201d she tweeted.\n\nNyong\u2019o played Nakia in Black Panther and will reprise Maz Kanata in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, which opens in theaters Dec. 20. She will release Sulwe on Oct. 15.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 Lupita Nyong\u2019o says her book, Sulwe, reflects her journey to self-love.
