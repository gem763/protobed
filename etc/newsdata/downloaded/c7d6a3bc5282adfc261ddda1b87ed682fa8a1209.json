Yet this year, it resonates in a different way, because now I'm a father.\n\n\"Last year, when my wife and I attended, we knew we were expecting our first child\u2014no one else did at the time, but we did\u2014and I remember squeezing Meghan's hand so tight during the awards, both of us thinking what it would be like to be parents one day, and more so, what it would be like to do everything we could to protect and help our child should they be born with immediate challenges or become unwell over time. And now, as parents, being here and speaking to all of you pulls at my heartstrings in a way I could have never understood until I had a child of my own.\"\n\nThe prince struggled to choke back tears during his heartfelt speech\u2014a moment that BAZAAR royal correspondent Omid Scobie captured and shared on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\n\nTouching words from a moved Prince Harry, who has just handed out the awards to @WellChild\u2019s youngest inspirational child winners.

So thank you for being you.\"\n\nHarry might have managed to hold back his tears, but we're not so sure we'll be able to do the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "And, yes, there's video.", "authors": ["Kayleigh Roberts"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TVYCEPyxxf7qFIpg5rgisg--~B/aD03MjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_391/3530ae4dbff629dea4da085d74906636", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
