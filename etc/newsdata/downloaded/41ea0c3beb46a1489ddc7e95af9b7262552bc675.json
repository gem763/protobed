Bolton had been hawkish on Iran and other global challenges.\n\nRouhani\u2019s website quoted him as further urging the U.S. to \u201cabandon warmongering and its maximum pressure policy\u201d on Iran. He spoke at a Cabinet meeting in Tehran.\n\nAli Rabiei, a government spokesman, said after the meeting that Bolton\u2019s dismissal may help the U.S. have a \u201cless biased\u201d attitude toward Iran.\n\nThough he stressed the dismissal was an internal U.S. issue, Rabiei called Bolton \u201cthe symbol of America\u2019s hawkish policies and its animosity toward Iran.\u201d\n\nBolton was critical of any potential talks between Trump and leaders of Iran and persuaded Trump to keep U.S. forces in Syria to counter the Iranian influence in the region.\n\nTrump last year pulled the U.S. out of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal that lifted sanction on Iran in exchange for caps on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The U.S. administration later also intensified sanctions on Iran, slashing its sales of crude oil abroad and sending the country\u2019s economy into freefall.\n\nIn response, Iran has in recent months crept past the limits the nuclear deal imposed on uranium enrichment and its uranium stockpile. And over the weekend, Tehran announced it would use advanced centrifuges prohibited under the deal.\n\nMeanwhile, mysterious attacks on oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, the downing of a U.S. military surveillance drone by Iran and other incidents across the wider Middle East have exacerbated the crisis in the region as Tehran tries to pressure Europe to find a way to sell crude oil abroad despite U.S. sanctions.\n\nRouhani has called the use of faster centrifuges Iran\u2019s \u201cthird step\u201d away from the nuclear deal. On Wednesday, he said that \u201cif necessary, we will take other steps in [the] future.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Iran's president urged the U.S. on Wednesday to \"put warmongers aside\" as tensions roil the Persian Gulf amid an escalating crisis between Washington and Tehran in the wake of the collapsing nuclear deal with world powers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Nasser Karimi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/05/iran_persian_gulf_tensions_23677_c0-0-2500-1457_s1770x1032.jpg?0fe0070a1052bfe99ea41a6259e31e206339a006", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
