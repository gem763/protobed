Democrats overreaching? SCOTUS may decide", "language": "en", "text": "Three House committees conducting depositions set deadlines for subpoenas seeking documents from Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, the Pentagon, and the Office of Management and Budget. Giuliani refused to comply, as did the others.\n\nAt the same time, investigators are seeking documents from Vice President Mike Pence and others \u2013 with the implied threat that court action could follow.
