The officer and the man struggled and \u201cshots were fired,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. The commissioner, who said that he watched video surveillance of the incident, said the fight was \u201cextremely disturbing\u201d and that the two ended up on the floor. O\u2019Neill also said that the suspect punched the officer repeatedly, injuring the officer\u2019s face.\n\nThe officer\u2019s colleagues rushed over to intervene and shot at the suspect, hitting him \u201cseveral times,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. The man was pronounced dead at Harlem Hospital Center later that night. Police did not identify him, but O\u2019Neill said that he\u2019d had \u201cdomestic violence interactions\u201d with the police in the past.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

O\u2019Neill did not say whether the suspect had been shot by the suspect or by another officer, but said that police were investigating how many shots had gone off.\n\nLocal news channel PIX11 reported that the officer was treated for his injuries and released from the hospital later that morning. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio visited the the officer at the hospital and said that he seemed to be in \u201cgood spirits.\u201d\n\nThe president of the police union, Patrick Lynch, called the officers \u201cheroic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s odd when you come to the hospital and say, \u2018Hey kid, you were lucky,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cHe\u2019s lucky that he was shot? No, he\u2019s lucky that he\u2019s a professional police officer. His partner\u2019s a professional police officer. And he had that bullet-resistant vest on.\u201d\n\nWrite to Tara Law at tara.law@time.com.", "description": "Police say that an officer was shot in his bullet-resistant vest after a \"violent struggle\" with an armed man in New York City on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Tara Law"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/police.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
