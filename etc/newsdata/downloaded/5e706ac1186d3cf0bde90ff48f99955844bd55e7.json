It represented the first truly new kind of depression drug since Prozac arrived in 1988.\n\nThe new studies are part of Johnson & Johnson's effort to win FDA approval for treating depressed patients who are also suicidal.\n\nThe company envisions having suicidal patients take the drug twice a week for four weeks along with an oral antidepressant, Hough says. After that, doctors could choose to continue prescribing esketamine to patients with major depression that didn't respond to other drugs.\n\nDepression drugs are rarely tested in suicidal patients because of concern that they may harm themselves, Hough says. And that concern proved warranted in the two new studies.\n\n\"There were some suicide attempts in both treatment arms and there was one completed suicide,\" he says.\n\nBut both esketamine and ketamine have great potential to prevent suicide, according to mental health professionals. Suicide claimed more than 47,000 lives in the U.S. in 2017.\n\nWhen the FDA approved esketamine for depression in March, Dr. Dennis Charney, dean of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York told NPR it was \"potentially a game changer for millions of people.\" He helped develop the treatment two decades ago for people with treatment resistant depression. \"Many of them are suicidal,\" Charney said. \"So it's essentially a deadly disease when you haven't responded to available treatments.\"", "description": "Spravato, a nasal spray of the anesthetic ketamine, has been shown to help people with major depression.
