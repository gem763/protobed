Umbrella Academy s2 is coming soon \u2602\ufe0f.\u2019\n\nThe show burst on to screens earlier this year and swiftly gained a huge and loyal fanbase, as a staggering 45 million viewers tuned into the show in its first month streaming on Netflix.\n\nSeason two is set to be one of the streaming giant\u2019s most anticipated releases when it comes out next year, but until that time, there\u2019s one overarching question on every fan\u2019s minds (this one included) \u2013 what on Earth (or off Earth, really) happens next?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecap\n\nDedicated viewers of the show will remember The Umbrella Academy ended on the mother of all cliffhangers.\n\nOur favourite antiheroes escaped their crumbling home as their sibling Vanya destroyed their mansion, with Diego saved from the falling debris by Ben whilst Five got drawn into meeting The Handler at a motel \u2013 which turned out to be a distraction.\n\nSeason one ended on a rough note (Picture: Netflix)\n\nThe siblings escaped and headed to The Icarus Theatre, where Vanya planned to destroy the world, and whilst Allison managed to incapacitate Vanya, it was too late, and her energy destroyed the moon.\n\nThis of course kick-started the destruction of Earth \u2013 which was what the siblings had been tasked with preventing in the first place.\n\nFaced with the destruction of his world, Five suggested they use their abilities to travel back in time to stop the Apocalypse as a team.\n\nVanya had no idea of what she was able to do (Picture: Netflix)\n\nCue cliffhanger ending.\n\nWhat\u2019s the cast saying about season 2?\n\nFirstly, all the Hargreeves kids will be back; Vanya (Ellen Page), Luther (Tom Hopper), Klaus (Robert Sheehan), Allison (Emmy Raver-Lampman), Diego (David Castaneda), Number Five (Aidan Gallagher) and Ben (Ethan Hwang).\n\nTom Hopper, who plays Luther Hargreeves, has suggested that time travel is likely to be an important theme in the upcoming new season.\n\nSpeaking to Den of Geek, he said: \u2018With this show that\u2019s a huge question \u2018cause we could go in so many different directions.\n\n\u2018And yeah, the time travel element is gonna be a huge one. Where we are and then what we do in that time period remains to be seen.\u2019\n\nIf they go back in time, will they be teenagers again? (Picture: Netflix)\n\nThere will be more of Vanya, according to Page. She told the publication: \u2018For me, it\u2019s going be so interesting to explore Vanya. It\u2019s like Vanya 2.0 \u2013 less repressed and what does that mean in the good ways and bad kinda thing.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if the \u2018murmurings are to be believed,\u2019 said Robert Sheehan, who plays Klaus, his character will change completely.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s [Klaus] constantly emerging into this new self. He\u2019s a butterfly that refuses to leave the cocoon, or he keeps going back into it.\n\nWill Klaus come to terms with his troubling power? (Picture: Netflix)\n\n\u2018I\u2019d love to see Klaus re-formed as something else, different completely. Hopefully, if the murmurings are to be believed, that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re headed.\u2019\n\nCameron Britton, who plays Hazel, said the cast are just as much in the dark about it as fans: \u2018There are so many questions of what happens next but [showrunner] Steve Blackman\u2019s being horrible and won\u2019t tell me about it.\u2019\n\nTheories\n\nIt is likely that the kids\u2019 adoptive father Sir Reginald Hargeeves will return, if in no other form other than flashbacks \u2013 as he did in the first season\u2013 especially given Klaus\u2019s ability to summon the dead.\n\nMary J Blige plays a hilarious assassin (Picture: Netflix)\n\nHazel and Cha-Cha (Mary J Blige) may also return as the idiosyncratic time-travelling assassin duo, though it remains to be seen how that will happen given Cha-Cha was vaporised as chunks of moon rained down on Earth.\n\nIf showrunners dip into the Dallas volume of the comics, they may be taken to an alternate universe where John F Kennedy was never assassinated and the Lincoln monument is on a rampage (yes, really.)\n\nIf they dip into Hotel Oblivion, the show will have the siblings dealing with their father\u2019s most troubling creation: the Hotel Oblivion, an Arkham Asylum-style institution where Hargreeves sent the villains that his children captured.\n\nWe want Ben back from the dead (Picture: Netflix)\n\nIt may well be that, like season one, season two will dip into a bit of both whilst ultimately creating a new narrative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does the Umbrella Academy comic book say?\n\nWith little to go on in terms of spoilers, we have to look to the comic books by Gerard Way and Gabriel Ba for plot theories.\n\nWay and Ba have written three volumes of The Umbrella Academy \u2013 Apocalypse Suite, Dallas and Hotel Oblivion.\n\nOnce more for the people at the back: We. Want. Ben (Picture: Instagram)\n\nThere are elements of Apocalyse Suite in season one, so it stands to reason that there may be elements of Dallas and/or Hotel Oblivion in the second season.\n\n\u2018The goal for us is to stay ahead of the show,\u2019 Way told Digital Spy, \u2018and since we\u2019re on series three [of the comics], we are now ahead of the show. So that\u2019s a good thing.\n\n\u2018The idea with the comic is to go right from series three, take a three-to-four-month break, then go right into series four. That is kind of our schedule to keep us on track. So there is story there and it\u2019s all planned out.\u2019\n\nNew cast members\n\nNetflix has revealed three new additions for the second season \u2013 exciting stuff.\n\nJoining the second season will be new cast member Rit Arya, of Humans ilk as character Lila, who is described as a \u2018chameleon who can be as brilliant or as clinically insane as the situation requires\u2019 \u2013 standard.\n\nYusuf Gatewood (Good Omens) is also joining the ranks as Raymond, who is a \u2018born leader with the smarts, gravitas, and the confidence to never have to prove it to anyone\u2019 and has the ability to \u2018disarm you with a look.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarin Ireland plays Sissy, who is described as a \u2018fearless, no-nonsense Texas mom [sic] who married young for all the wrong reasons.\u2019\n\nRitu Arya, Yusuf Gatewood and Marin Ireland (Picture: Getty)\n\nA group of misfits joining a group of misfits? Sounds about right.\n\nNone of the new characters are from the original comic, prompting fans to wonder how far season two will deviate from the source material.\n\nWhat do we want to happen?\n\nWe\u2019ve written an extensive list of all our requirements for season two, so listen up Umbrella Academy folks.\n\nAmong other things, we want Luther and Allison to figure out whether their love story will be more Romeo and Juliet or Taming of the Shrew.\n\nWe also want to see more of the people born with supernatural powers at the same time as the Hargreeves. That\u2019s 36 different potential superpowers that are just waiting to be discovered.\n\nAlso, we want Ben to come back from the dead. Please.\n\nThe Umbrella Academy season two is expected for release on Netflix in 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
