Major indexes flitted between small gains and losses for much of the day before turning lower in the afternoon.\n\nAs the week progresses, traders say they will be keeping their eyes on headlines emerging from Washington. High-level officials are set to meet there to discuss trade relations between the U.S. and China.\n\nWith expectations low among investors, even a partial deal might be enough to help keep things on track, said Geoffrey Yu, head of the U.K. investment office at the wealth-management arm of UBS.\n\nInvestors will be watching the U.S. consumer, and the agricultural sector in particular, for a positive response to any reduction in trade hostilities, Mr. Yu said.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 95.70 points, or 0.4%, to 26478.02. The S&P 500 fell 13.22 points, or 0.4%, to 2938.79 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 26.18 points, or 0.3%, to 7956.29.\n\nLosses among shares of food and drink producers kept the S&P 500 under pressure.\n\nConstellation Brands fell $5, or 2.6%, to $188.74, while Mondelez International declined 91 cents, or 1.6%, to $55.07.\n\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 advanced 0.7%, with gains for health-care stocks and food and beverage companies offsetting losses among auto makers.\n\nShares of auto-parts maker Continental AG were among the biggest decliners in the region, falling EUR1.28, or 1.1%, to EUR112.76 ($123.70). The company last month confirmed it would close production plants in several countries.\n\nSome European data heightened investors' worries about the global economy. Factory orders in Germany slipped more than expected in August, while confidence among eurozone investors fell to the lowest level in six years.\n\nThe reports, coming days after a gauge of U.S. factory activity slipped to the lowest level in a decade, added to signs that economic growth is softening around the world.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average slipped 0.2%, while South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.1%. Markets in Hong Kong and mainland China remained shut for a national holiday.\n\nLee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG, said there had been a number of reports that China may not be as willing to compromise as much as the Trump administration hopes.\n\n\"The U.S. would like a trade deal with China, a wide-ranging deal, but those demands look like they're unlikely to be accepted by China,\" he said. \"Things like intellectual-property rights and other structural issues like state subsidies look unlikely to be resolved.\"\n\nHe added that China may buy more agricultural goods, but it is unclear whether or not that partial agreement will be a big enough win for the U.S.\n\nWrite to Anna Isaac at anna.isaac@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 07, 2019 19:36 ET (23:36 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
