However, it can be challenging to attract and retain sufficiently qualified and experienced auditors to commit to this each year,\u201d the submission said.\n\n\u201cMany competent auditors tire of this constant pressure and opt for roles in commerce.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother submission to the inquiry, the author of which was redacted, said the stress of a busy season on overworked junior auditors meant the final steps of audits were not completed satisfactorily.\n\nMr Francis called for audit deadlines to be spread through the year, with different timelines based on company size or sector both possible solutions.\n\nASIC\u2019s reporting\n\nBentleys' submission also said ASIC\u2019s audit inspection process was up to scratch, contradicting Deloitte\u2019s managing partner of audit and assurance Jamie Gatt's stance that ASIC\u2019s reporting is \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe feedback I get from across the group is when ASIC does come and audit files, it\u2019s a really comprehensive and detailed process. They really focus on an area and dig into it,\u201d Mr Francis said.\n\nHe also said the corporate watchdog did \u201ca good job\u201d of communicating where it saw risks and stuck to these \u201cpretty consistently\u201d.\n\nThis counters complaints from large audit firms that they do not know how ASIC chooses its areas of focus each year, which Monash University auditing professor Robyn Moroney said was a common concern.\n\nMr Francis said the issue with ASIC\u2019s reporting instead lay in the results being \u201csensationalised\u201d by the media and hence misunderstood by the public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the audit itself that has failed or is wrong, but the sufficiency of documented audit evidence the auditors relied on when forming their opinion.\"\n\nBentleys also undergoes its own audit checks, where partners from other cities peer-review and rate each other\u2019s audits. These results matched those of ASIC's reviews on audits that underwent both processes.\n\nIn its submission, Bentleys said it understood some firms did not have a similarly robust annual quality assurance process, suggesting this may lead to reliance on insufficient audit evidence.", "description": "Big four firms using audit as a \u2018loss leader\u2019 to get more lucrative consulting work from audit clients risk creating an uncompetitive audit market, according to a national accounting firm.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2718%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_42/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c740c2d8d438d80eb4a6ff82b09134b801f62838", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
