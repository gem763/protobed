More than 42 days have passed without any new measles cases in New York's Sullivan and Orange counties, the statement said, and outbreaks in Rockland County and New York City also ended recently.\n\n\"The threat, however, for vaccine-preventable diseases remains and the Department is not letting down its guard,\" New York state Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said in a statement Thursday, adding that there are responses underway in Nassau, Monroe and Putnam counties, which have measles exposures related to international travel.\n\nIn 2000, measles was declared eliminated in the United States, meaning it was no longer continuously transmitted in the country. The World Health Organization removes a country's elimination status when measles has been spreading continuously for one year. Losing that elimination status would be a black eye on the United States, public health experts have said.\n\n\"The end of the New York state measles outbreak is a credit to the great work by local and state health departments, community and religious leaders, and other partners,\" the CDC's Thursday statement said. \"However, this outbreak is a grave reminder that we need heightened vigilance around measles as well as other vaccine preventable diseases, and we continue to address the myths and misinformation driving these outbreaks. CDC continues to encourage parents to speak with their family's healthcare provider about the importance of vaccination. We also encourage local leaders to provide accurate, scientific-based information to counter misinformation. Vaccines remain the most powerful tool to preserve health and to save lives.\n\nRead More", "description": "With the end of the New York state measles outbreak, \"the United States anticipates maintaining its measles elimination status,\" a statement from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Jamie Gumbrecht", "John Bonifield"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190129140155-20190129-measles-outbreak-illustration-super-tease.jpg"}
