Toy Story was the first-ever entirely computer-animated film; now CGI animation is common, and the hand-drawn cel animation it replaced is a shrinking rarity. Toy Story was considered a huge success because it made more than $300 million at the box office; the newest sequel was considered a mild disappointment because it didn\u2019t meet the outstanding projections for its performance, meaning it only brought in $1 billion.\n\nBut more significantly, Toy Story dropped into a world where Pixar Animation Studios was still an unknown, rather than an industry-shaping inspiration. Expectations for the first Toy Story were modest. Expectations for Toy Story 4 were outsized in part because Pixar has been such a powerful industry force over the last 25 years, and the Toy Story series in particular has been such a critical, aesthetic, narrative, and financial success. It was a major legacy to live up to with a third sequel. First-time feature director Josh Cooley is a Pixar vet who\u2019s worked as a storyboard artist, writer, and shorts director on projects from Ratatouille and the Cars movies, to Up and Inside Out. With Toy Story 4 releasing digitally on October 1st, and coming to 4K UHD and Blu-ray October 8th, Cooley talked to The Verge about the biggest challenges on the film, from specific story beats to character design and making the perfect virtual spider.\n\nWhat was your biggest challenge on Toy Story 4 from a technological perspective?\n\nJosh Cooley: It would definitely be the antique store. We have about 10,000 items in that store, and each one had to be shaded and built and rendered, so there\u2019s a lot of information for the computer to wrap its head around. And we knew we were going to be in that antique store for a big chunk of the film. There\u2019s also dust, and spiderwebs, and all this detail. So at first, we weren\u2019t even sure we would be able to fill a store that big with that much stuff. The tone I really wanted was like a jungle, like a crammed city jungle, just a lot of stuff, how the stores are. We did a test a couple summers earlier, and we were able to make it work, so it seemed like would be possible.\n\nYou\u2019ve said you put a lot of visual Easter eggs in the antique store because you got \u201clazy,\u201d so you put in renders of things like Bing Bong\u2019s rocket from Inside Out. What else should viewers watch out for on home video?\n\n[Laughs] I should verify that it wasn\u2019t out of laziness. That was just a joke. We do actually have to re-render everything, it\u2019s not as easy as just clicking and dragging something from an old film. We have to start over again every time. But my favorite thing is, in one shot, there\u2019s a casting of a hand in the background. And that is Ed Catmull\u2019s hand. Ed\u2019s the [former] president of the studio, and it was the very first computer model that was ever created. He did it as like, a project in school. I think they even used it in Star Trek: Wrath of Khan or something. [Catmull worked on the film\u2019s computer-generated Genesis simulation.] So we made it into a plaster statue that you can purchase at an antique store.\n\nIt\u2019s so random.\n\nTalking to Pixar over the years about its evolving technology, we\u2019ve heard a lot about your light renderers and how they change the textures of your world. How does your lighting interact with something as visually complex as spiderwebs?\n\nYeah, that\u2019s a great question. I\u2019m not exactly sure even how that works. I do know they had to build, basically, a virtual spider to design the webs realistically. They\u2019d say, \u201cWhere exactly would you like to have spiderwebs?\u201d And I\u2019d point on the screen where I\u2019d like them, and then they would send the spider into action that would create natural-looking spiderwebs. It was insane, it was amazing. To be able to direct that side of the film, the technological side, all I had to do was talk about the emotion I wanted, and the animators would go do their magic and come back and show me incredible stuff. It was like a magic trick. It was insane.\n\nWhat was the hardest sequence to plan and design?\n\nThe big action scene in the store, when they\u2019re rescuing Forky out of the cabinet. That was a tough one. There were a lot of moving parts, a lot of characters. The staging had to be very clear as to where the characters were. We use the lighting to help sell that. The light coming in from the front of the store is casting into the store, so in the beginning, Woody and the toys are in shadow, and then when they get into the cabinet, the light\u2019s streaming in. So we really made a difference between the two parts of the set they were on. But there\u2019s a lot of action, a lot of story beats within that action scene that had to be very clear. So that was a tough one.\n\nWhat about from an emotional perspective? What was hardest to convey when you were trying to break down the narrative and get the script set?\n\nProbably the Bo and Woody relationship. Overall, we kept a real close eye on it. It was so important. Because this is a movie about their relationship, we looked at a lot of movies about relationships. Often there\u2019s not a lot of dialog to establish a relationship. It\u2019s mostly the looks between actors and the chemistry you can feel when you\u2019re seeing how someone will look at someone else for just an extra little beat. Really subtle little things. And so, whenever we had moments like that, we made sure when we were animating it to bring everybody into the room at the same time and look at all the shots back to back. We wouldn\u2019t just look at a single shot, like we tend to do. We\u2019d look at the whole scene in whatever state of animation it was, just to make sure that every beat was being timed correctly and was being acted in the correct way.\n\nThe boldness of the ending was a big surprise to a lot of fans of the franchise, but Pixar just released an alternate ending that went in the exact opposite direction, and it apparently got as far as the animatic stage. What kind of conversations did you have about how you wanted to end the film?\n\nWell, the very first version \u2014 this was always just in animatics \u2014 all the toys, including Bo, came back to Bonnie\u2019s house at the end, and it was kind of like, \u201cBonnie has a new lamp now, and everything\u2019s reset the way it was, but now with Bo in the picture.\u201d And it just wasn\u2019t emotionally satisfying. We didn\u2019t really learn anything in that version.\n\nSo we thought, \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens with a Casablanca-type ending,\u201d where they love each other, but they know they have different duties they have to perform now. So that\u2019s what you saw in the deleted scenes. And that wasn\u2019t satisfying, either. And then we went on to the next step, which was, \u201cLet\u2019s see what it looks like if they both don\u2019t return.\u201d I had this thought \u2014 I remember walking through this pitch with the producers. Just talking about him staying with the love of his life and saying goodbye to his friends, and saying \u201cTo infinity and beyond!\u201d with Buzz, my voice cracked with the emotion of that moment. I could feel that. So I was convinced that if I could put that emotion on the screen, it could mean something.\n\nWhat were the biggest challenges in the design stage, particularly in designing Ducky and Bunny?\n\nWell, the great thing is \u2014 my production designer, Bob Pauley, was a designer on the first Toy Story. He actually designed Buzz Lightyear. So he came in with the design aesthetic, knowing the world. Toy Story is all about exaggerated shapes seen from low perspectives, because that\u2019s where the characters are going to be most of the time. He knows theatrical lighting and realistic textures are the things that defined Toy Story. With Ducky and Bunny, I said, \u201cThese are carnival toys. Most carnival toys are crappy.\u201d They don\u2019t look like you can really hug them, because they\u2019re made of this awful material that\u2019s really cheap. These guys are designed to be as cute as possible, which will contrast perfectly with their actual personalities. So the designers showed me tons of different designs of cute animals, and we narrowed it down to two, who are attached and have these off colors, you know, with a bright blue Bunny and such.\n\nForky is a new visual element for this world, and he has to look like trash but still be a personable, relatable character. What were the discussions around his design?\n\nThere weren\u2019t that many! [Laughs] He\u2019s very simple, which is what I love about him. When we first started speaking about an art craft becoming a toy, the very first drawing, I think, was of a spork. And when we all saw that, we all just kept drawing sporks with different types of arms and legs. It was just that sporks are funny. In a weird way \u2014 we didn\u2019t even plan this, but the idea of a spork being a fork and a spoon also complements the idea that he\u2019s trash and a toy at the same time. Even in his creation, he\u2019s not even sure what he is. So there was just something really funny and entertaining about that.\n\nPeople take Pixar movies so seriously, debating your timeline and your philosophy and so forth. And Forky freaked people out because they\u2019re saying, \u201cSo can anything be a toy? Can anything in this world come to life, and then it\u2019s alive forever?\u201d Do you guys have these kinds of philosophical discussions? Did you talk about what Forky was doing to your world?\n\nOh yeah! That\u2019s how he was born. We were in a room talking about our own kids, and how the rules of Toy Story are that toys come to life. We said, \u201cWell, our own kids in real life, they will pick up a rock and play with it. If Bonnie does that, does that mean the rock\u2019s alive?\u201d So we started pulling the threads on the universe. But then we were like, \u201cWell, wait, let\u2019s embrace that! Let\u2019s say what would happen!\u201d And the fact is, that thing that was not a toy would come to life. It has never seen Toy Story 1, 2, or 3, so it doesn\u2019t understand any of the rules of the world. And we were just busting ourselves up with how ridiculous that was.\n\nBut also just the fact that the audience is coming in with all this knowledge of Toy Story. So to have a character show up that doesn\u2019t understand it gives you so much leverage, comedy-wise. But also, it allows you to have an innocent character that can force Woody to explain what it means to be a toy. And then we could say, \u201cOh, now he\u2019s supporting Woody\u2019s story. Now there\u2019s a real reason to have him in the movie.\u201d", "description": "Pixar director Josh Cooley, who\u2019s worked on Pixar projects from Inside Out to the Cars movies, takes us behind the scenes on Toy Story 4, talking about the movie\u2019s biggest narrative and technological challenges.
