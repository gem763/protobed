But the public\u2019s rising disgust with corruption in the Democratic administration of Mayor David Rose led to steady and significant gains for the socialists, and in 1910 they won 21 of 35 City Council seats, 14 state legislative seats and the mayor\u2019s office. That year, Victor Berger also became the first socialist elected to Congress.\n\nThere was no need to go on a \u201clistening tour\u201d to find out what the working class wanted, since so many of the party\u2019s newly elected officials were workers themselves, including the new mayor of Milwaukee, a woodcarver named Emil Seidel. The eldest of 11 children, Seidel had been forced to go to work after grammar school. He and his fellow socialists in city government \u2014 including his personal secretary, the poet Carl Sandburg \u2014 instituted dozens of measures to improve their constituents\u2019 lives.\n\nThey installed hundreds of drinking fountains, prosecuted restaurateurs for serving tainted food and compelled factory owners to put in heating systems and toilets. Most significantly, Seidel appointed an aggressive new health commissioner, whose department oversaw a reduction of more than 40 percent in the number of cases of the six leading contagious diseases, among them scarlet fever, whooping cough and smallpox, within two years.\n\nThe most widely admired trait of the sewer socialists was their integrity. \u201cThey never were approached by the lobbyists, because the lobbyists knew it was not possible to influence these men,\u201d William Evjue, a Republican assemblyman, said of his socialist colleagues. Chicago, 80 miles to the south, was awash in corruption for decades, while Seidel\u2019s administration had largely cleaned up Milwaukee\u2019s municipal government in its brief run. But Democrats and Republicans joined forces to run a single candidate against Seidel, and he and most of the city\u2019s elected socialists were defeated in 1912. (Later that year, when Debs ran for president, Seidel was his running mate, helping the Socialist Party win 6 percent of the vote, its highest percentage ever.)\n\nOne Milwaukee socialist who survived, however, was Daniel Hoan, the city attorney, who was not up for re-election that year. In 1916, Hoan avenged the socialists\u2019 losses by winning the mayor\u2019s office, which he held until 1940. Hoan oversaw further public investment, including the construction of the nation\u2019s first public housing project, Garden Homes.\n\nDuring Hoan\u2019s tenure, an urban planner named Charles Whitnall designed sewer socialism\u2019s most enduring achievement: the Milwaukee County park system, one of the most extensive and acclaimed in the country. The city added miles of new parkland along Lake Michigan\u2019s waterfront, which had been dominated by private mansions.\n\nHoan adhered to sewer socialism\u2019s tradition of spending taxpayer money frugally. \u201cThe objective is to give the best government possible,\u201d Hoan once said. \u201cBut not necessarily at a low tax rate \u2014 at the lowest cost that can be paid.\u201d During the Depression, he created a voluntary program in which city employees, including Hoan, took a 10 percent pay cut to fund public works projects that put nearly 15,000 unemployed people to work.", "description": "When \u201csewer socialism\u201d ruled during the first half of the 20th century, Milwaukee flourished.", "authors": ["Dan Kaufman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/opinion/15Kaufman1/15Kaufman-02-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
