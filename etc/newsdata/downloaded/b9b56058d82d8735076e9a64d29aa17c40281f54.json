And that's part of the plan.\n\n\"But results are always are always the main thing and we can move forward quicker if we get results and performances.\n\n\"But I'm sure we will get there. It's just still planning for the next transfer window, summer transfer window and how we see the team moving forward.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMeanwhile, Woodward hit back at the critics of Manchester United's recruitment system as the executive vice-chairman reiterated his backing of under-fire manager Solskjaer with Sunday's clash against Liverpool looming large.\n\n\"The middle section of last season, after Ole's arrival, feels most relevant to what we want to achieve and where we want to be,\" the executive vice-chairman said, having publicly pledged his faith in Solskjaer three weeks ago.\n\n\"We saw a team playing fast, fluid football, with a clear representation of the style and philosophy the manager wants.\n\n\"Ole has also instilled the discipline back into an environment where we may have lacked it in recent years.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"He is building a squad that respects the club's history, in which players work hard and respect their team-mates. No-one is bigger than the club.\n\n\"The changes we saw over the summer have resulted in a very young squad.\n\n\"But it's also a squad, with the players and the culture, that provides a base camp for us to build and grow from as we start our new journey.\"", "description": "Man Utd's executive vice-chairman\u00a0 Ed Woodward reiterated his backing of under-fire manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Manchester United Via Getty Imag", "Pa", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20647051.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
