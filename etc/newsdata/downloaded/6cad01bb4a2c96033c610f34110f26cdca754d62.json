Basetsana Makgalemele and Romeo Kumalo\n\n\n\nWhen former Miss South Africa Basetsana Makgalamele married her Romeo, not only were her relatives in attendance but her Top Billing family too.\n\n\n\nBasetsana and her husband, former Vodacom executive Romeo Kumalo, tied the knot in December 2000.\n\n\n\nThe 25-plus motor cavalcade consisted of four Rolls Royces, a Bentley and several BMWs. The convoy of luxury cars was escorted by VIP Protection Services, who have looked after Nelson Mandela.\n\n\n\nMore than 4000 white roses, St Joseph's lilies, and hydrangeas were flown in from Mauritius for the couple's big day.\n\n\n\nBassie arrived by boat on the Vaal River and was welcomed by a retinue of navy officers, who formed a guard of honour with drawn swords.\n\n\n\nBehind the camera and behind-the-scenes - Top Billing was there, beaming from ear to ear.\n\n2. Bryan Habana and Janine Viljoen\n\n\n\nWhen rugby superstar Bryan Habana married the love of his life, Janine Viljoen and Top Billing was lucky enough to be there.\n\n\n\nSport24 reported that a security company cordoned off part of the street outside with yellow cones to keep people away from the gate.\n\n\n\nGuests parked their cars a distance from the estate and were escorted in luxury cars to the ceremony.\n\n\n\nEven the caterers had to carry some of the food and beverages onto the estate since they weren't allowed to drive in.\n\n3. Rolene Strauss and D'Niel Strauss\n\nAfter Rolene Strauss became Miss South Africa and Miss World, she then married the man of her dreams, D'Niel Strauss.\n\n\n\nThe dress, the courtship, proposal and their magical wedding - Top Billing brought us the fairytale as told by Rolene.\n\n\n\nThe event planner transformed the venue into a sensational, opulent scene with cascading florals in crisp white, combined with curated elements of romance and luxury.\n\n\n\nFor a dramatic entrance, Rolene arrived by horse and carriage, and elegant clusters of crystal chandeliers hung throughout the reception area gave an opulent feel.\n\n4. Siya Kolisi and Rachel Smith\n\nAfter four years of romance, Bok flank Siya Kolisi and his fianc\u00e9e Rachel tied the knot in a Cape vineyard in 2016.\n\n\n\nAmid vineyards and oak trees at Molenvliet Wine in Stellenbosch, Rachel and Siya opening the dance floor to Michael Bubl\u00e9's A Song For You reported City Press.\n\n\n\nAmongst the groomsmen were best man Nick Holton, childhood friend Tanqa Ncwana and Siya's rugby team-mates.\n\n5.
