However, neither party controls a majority in the 120-seat parliament without the support of Avigdor Lieberman, who heads the midsize Yisrael Beitenu party.\n\nNetanyahu had hoped to secure a majority with his allies in hopes of winning immunity from an expected indictment on corruption charges.\n\nThe results raise the likelihood of a unity government between the three parties.", "description": "According to the exit polls, Netanyahu has failed to control a majority in the 120-seat parliament.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GI303_netany_ZG_20180501104608.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
