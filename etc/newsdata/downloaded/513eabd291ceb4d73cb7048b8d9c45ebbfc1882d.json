Stephens now wants a rematch, which was made clear in a hotel lobby confrontation that made neither man look better afterward.\n\nThe beginning of the saga came when, after exchanging initial blows during a UFC event in Mexico City, Rodriguez raked his left hand over the eyes of Stephens. Referee Herb Dean immediately paused the fight after seeing Stephens\u2019 reaction.\n\nStephens was unable to open his left eye for five minutes as a cageside doctor attended to him, and Dean eventually called the fight a no-contest.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Mexico City crowd was predictably livid with the decision, hurling garbage at Stephens as he exited the arena.\n\nJeremy Stephens wants a rematch\n\nRodriguez has since publicly doubted the severity of Stephens\u2019 injury. Stephens has maintained he was not able to open the eye until he was in the hospital, but has since recovered and sustained no permanent damage, per MMA Fighting.\n\nStephens also said he\u2019d be up for a rematch with Rodriguez, and he made that perfectly clear during a confrontation in a hotel lobby on Sunday.\n\nWarning: The video below contains very graphic language.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to make out every word of what is being said by the chest-to-chest fighters, but the important parts are clear.\n\n\u201cF--king p---y, bro. You\u2019re gonna have to live with that for the rest of your f---ing life, p----. It\u2019s not me, I\u2019m fine motherf---er,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s run it back,\u201d Stephens said.\n\n\u201cRun it back? How about yesterday, you f---ing p----,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\n\u201cYou poked me in the eye, f----t. You poked me in the f---ing eye,\u201d Stephens said.\n\nRodriguez can be heard repeating the slur back to Stephens.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon motherf---er. Trust me. I\u2019ll see you soon, let\u2019s do it,\u201d Stephens said as the exchange ended.\n\nPer ESPN, Rodriguez said the hostility began when he asked Stephens how the eye was. When Stephens reportedly said it was fine, Rodriguez questioned what happened in the fight.\n\nRodriguez \u2014 who, remember, caused all of this with an illegal eye poke that could have gotten him disqualified rather than a no-contest \u2014 also said he will apologize in public for doubting the severity of Stephens\u2019 injury if his former opponent will take him to a doctor and show him results of his eye exams.\n\nClearly, this situation is transitioning from \u201churling garbage\u201d ugly to \u201cpersonal animus\u201d ugly. Stephens wants a chance to redeem one of the more disappointing UFC fights in recent memory. We\u2019ll see if Rodriguez acquiesces.\n\nJeremy Stephens wants a rematch. Will Yair Rodriguez give it to him?
