(Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden defended his son\u2019s foreign business dealings during Tuesday evening\u2019s Democratic debate, saying neither he nor his son is guilty of any wrongdoing in the controversy that has become the focal point of the impeachment probe against President Trump.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not okay for a president\u2019s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it okay for your son when you were vice president?\u201d CNN moderator Anderson Cooper asked Biden.\n\n\u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden responded. \u201cI carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy son made a judgment. I\u2019m proud of the judgement he made,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring a July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asked Zelensky to help his administration investigate allegations that Biden used his position as vice president to help Ukrainian natural-gas company Burisma Holdings avoid a corruption probe soon after the younger Biden was appointed to its board of directors.\n\nBiden, for his part, has admitted that in the spring of 2016, during his tenure as vice president, he called on Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor investigating the energy company paying his son. Biden suggested he would withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine if the country did not fire the prosecutor, who was accused by the State Department and U.S. allies in Europe of being soft on corruption.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is important is we focus on why it\u2019s so important to remove this man from office,\u201d Biden said Tuesday night regarding Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky. \u201cHe\u2019s going after me because he knows that if I get the nomination I will beat him like a drum.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the controversy, the younger Biden has promised he will no longer serve on the boards of foreign companies.", "description": "Former vice president Joe Biden defended his son's foreign business dealings during Tuesday evening's Democratic debate, saying neither he nor his son is guilty of any wrongdoing in the controversy that has become the focal point of the impeachment probe against President Trump.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Kevin D.
