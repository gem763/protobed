of the during the women's singles final \u2013 her first grand slam title AFP/Getty Images\n\nWilliams has now lost in her last four Grand Slam finals and television presenter Barker, who won the French Open in 1976, feels the American could be running out of time.\n\nBarker said: \u201cThere are players out there who aren\u2019t afraid of her anymore \u2013 that\u2019s the difference.\n\n\u201cShe had this aura about her before, she was so dominant in the finals, nobody could get near her, she played the big points so well.\n\n\u201cBut (on Saturday night) it was the youngster who played the big points better.\u201d\n\nWilliams, who gave birth to her daughter, Alexis, in September 2017, won her last Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open in 2017.\n\nShe has since lost in finals to Angelique Kerber (Wimbledon 2018), Naomi Osaka (US Open 2018), Simona Halep (Wimbledon 2019) and Andreescu (US Open 2019).\n\n\u201cShe turns 38 later this month,\u201d Barker added. \u201cShe is an incredible athlete and she\u2019s been in four Grand Slam finals since she gave birth to her daughter.\n\n\u201cSo she\u2019s still right up there, she\u2019s still doing well. If she\u2019s still motivated and wanting to do it, I think she will carry on.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, she\u2019s got another four (Grand Slams) next year and the Olympics, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll want to do that, she loves playing at the Olympics.\n\n\u201cThat will be the motivation. But there are so many good players.\u201d", "description": "Serena Williams\u2019 bid to break the women\u2019s all-time Grand Slam singles title record could be beyond her, according to former British No 1 Sue Barker.
