But the chef has whipped up two simple dishes to make cooking easy, affordable and healthy for the entire family.\n\nAs the founder of Malibu Farm, a fresh farm-to-table restaurant in California, New York City and several locations across the country, Henderson shared her simple mustard, chicken and breadcrumbs recipe and a lavash pizza with cauliflower dish that\u2019s both delicious and stress-free.\n\nChicken with Mustard and Breadcrumbs\n\nABC\n\nChicken goes really well with mustard, and there are several ways to make a chicken-and-mustard dish. My \"rule of crumb\" is: the thinner the chicken, the \ufb01ner the breadcrumbs should be. So a thin breast goes well with dry bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and cornmeal or with couscous. A thicker, skin-on breast goes well with fresh breadcrumbs.\n\nIngredients:\n\n\n\n6 tablespoons Dijon mustard\n\n4 eggs\n\n6 thin-pounded chicken breasts, seasoned lightly with salt\n\n1 cup flour\n\nOlive oil\n\n30/30/30 Bread crumb mixture (breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, yellow cornmeal)\n\nDirections:\n\nCombine the mustard and eggs. Dip the chicken in the \ufb02our. Then dip the chicken into the mustard-and-egg mixture. Finally, dip the chicken into your coating of choice.\n\nThe chicken can be prepared to this stage and refrigerated one day in advance.\n\nWhen ready to serve, saut\u00e9 the breasts in butter and olive oil, two or three at a time maximum. Do not crowd your skillet. Saut\u00e9 until brown and crispy (about 3 minutes per side). Transfer to paper towels to drain.\n\nMakes 6 servings.\n\nLavash Pizza with Cauliflower\n\nABC\n\nThis isn\u2019t really a pizza at all. It is more of a cracker. A cracker full of bubbling hot cheese and thinly sliced cauli\ufb02ower.\n\nIngredients:\n\n\n\n\u00bd cup Ricotta cheese\n\n1 egg\n\nShredded three-cheese blend\n\nOlive oil\n\nFlour tortillas\n\nLots of finely sliced cauliflower\n\n\n\nDirections:\n\n\n\nIn a food processor, combine the ricotta, goat cheese and egg. The exact quantities are not important; you just want to end up with a spreadable cheese mixture.\n\nBrush olive oil on a sheet pan, and lay the tortilla on top.\n\nSpread goat cheese and ricotta mixture on tortilla, distribute shredded cheese over it, and top with lots of \ufb01nely sliced cauli\ufb02ower.\n\nDrizzle olive oil on top, and season lightly with salt. Bake in a preheated 450 degree oven until lavash is starting to brown around the edges and get crispy. I am not gonna tell you how long that will take, because it really depends on your oven. Bake it until it is done. Remove from the oven and cut into squares.", "description": "A new", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/gma-mustard-chicken-ht-ls-191002_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
