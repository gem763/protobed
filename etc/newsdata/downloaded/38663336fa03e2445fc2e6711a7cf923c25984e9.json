Mandatory Credit: Matthew O'Haren-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe next phase of the NASCAR postseason begins Sunday with the Drydene 400 at Dover International Speedway (2:30 p.m. ET, NBCSN, MRN, SiriusXM NASCAR Radio).\n\nBowman is also getting plenty of attention for an incident on pit road after the race, and he showed up at Dover fully expecting questions about it.\n\nOn Sunday, an exhausted Bowman climbed out of his car at the Charlotte ROVAL and sat on the ground leaning against the car having been ill much of the week. While a medical worker and members of his team kneeled down by him to see how he was feeling, Cup driver Bubba Wallace approached. The two drivers exchanged words, and Wallace splashed his drink at Bowman as he walked away.\n\nWallace was angry with the way Bowman raced him. And vice versa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just focused on running well this weekend,\u201d Bowman said Friday. \u201cI\u2019m focused on my race car, trying to give the best feedback I can throughout practice and being strong today and Sunday.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he expected any on-track retaliation from Wallace, Bowman deferred.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s more of a question for those guys than it is for me,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I can do is go out there and do my job. I don\u2019t know, you\u2019ll have to ask them.\u201d\n\nBowman said he and Wallace have not spoken since their heated discussion on pit road at Charlotte.\n\n\u201cI feel like he said what he had to say after the race,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI\u2019ve just been kind of moving forward since then. I don\u2019t think we need to talk before Sunday. I think it is what it is.\u201d\n\nCertainly for Bowman, it has been a positive start to the Dover weekend. He was fifth fastest in the opening practice.\n\nREDDICK READY TO RISE IN SERIES RANKS\n\nAfter announcing big career news this week that he would be moving up into the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series ranks beginning in 2020, Xfinity Series championship contender Tyler Reddick addressed the media and offered his thoughts on the significant move in his career.\n\nReddick is the defending Xfinity Series champion, earning the title last year with JR Motorsports before moving to Richard Childress Racing this year. And Reddick has not slowed down. He won the regular-season championship and is ranked third in the playoffs coming to Saturday\u2019s Use Your Melon Drive Sober 200 (3 p.m. ET, NBCSN, MRN, SiriusXM NASCAR Radio) \u2014 the final race of Round 1 of the playoffs.\n\n\u201cRichard (Childress) has been pretty open with everyone when asked if he wanted to put me in a Cup car,\u201d Reddick said Friday. \u201cI think he realized if I wasn\u2019t going to be able to race for him in the Cup Series I was probably going to be picked up by someone else. They really wanted me to stay.\u201d\n\nReddick will be replacing Daniel Hemric in the No. 8 RCR Chevrolet next season. Hemric is a longtime RCR driver who started with the team driving in the Gander Outdoors Truck Series before moving into the Xfinity Series for two years and finally up to the Cup ranks. Hemric actually leads the Cup Sunoco Rookie of the Year standings but has only a pair of top-10 finishes in his first full Cup season.\n\nReddick has five Xfinity victories this year and a series-best 21 top-5 and 24 top-10 finishes. He won at Las Vegas three weeks ago and was runner-up at the Charlotte ROVAL playoff race last week.\n\nELLIOTT ENTERS ROUND 2 OF PLAYOFFS WITH STRONG STATISTICAL OUTLOOK\n\nOn paper, Chase Elliott comes to Dover International Speedway with all the momentum a driver could want. He won last week at the Charlotte ROVAL, is the defending winner of the Drydene 400, won at next week\u2019s venue, Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway in May and is the defending race winner at the following track, Kansas Speedway.\n\nYet, the humble, always even demeanor Elliott insists he is not necessarily an overwhelming favorite in this playoff round despite his quite literal track record.\n\n\u201cPast success doesn\u2019t guarantee a good run here Sunday,\u201d Elliott said, allowing a small smile. \u201cIf it did, we wouldn\u2019t put any effort in or wouldn\u2019t try, it would just be guaranteed so we wouldn\u2019t come.\u201d\n\nThe second-generation star and the sport\u2019s newest \u201cMost Popular Driver\u201d has long adopted the mantra of taking it a \u201crace at a time.\u201d But when you\u2019ve been as good as his No. 9 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet team has been, optimism seems a given.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just part of racing,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI think we just have to keep pushing and this round definitely isn\u2019t going to be an easy round. I think it\u2019s going to be tough. I think the caliber of cars left, there are some really strong teams in that 12, so I don\u2019t expect this to be easy, and we are certainly going to treat it that way.\u201d\n\nElliott, however, has been one of the best at Dover in recent years. He has six top-5 finishes in seven starts there, including the playoff win last year and back-to-back top-3 finishes in the two Dover races his rookie year. He won the pole position and started fifth at the track this May.\n\nGOOD NEWS AND A GOOD PLAN\n\nFan favorite Corey LaJoie shared some good news Friday: He and his wife, Kelly, are expecting their first child due next spring. The couple married New Year\u2019s Eve 2018.\n\nAnd the good vibes may well continue on-track as well. The driver of the No. 32 Go Fas Racing Ford is hopeful the small team can have a good run in Sunday\u2019s race. He won a NASCAR K&N Series race at Dover in 2012. More so, LaJoie, son of former Xfinity Series champion Randy LaJoie, is excited about next week\u2019s stop at Talladega, Ala., where he feels his team has a better shot at a good outing.\n\n\u201cWe have a pretty solid average finish over the three speedway races this year, and our game plan is to not get up there and race until right there at the end because normally we have just enough speed to get right into the middle of a crash,\u201d LaJoie said.\n\n\u201cWe will let everybody crash first because it isn\u2019t a matter of if, it is a matter of when. We will stay within arm\u2019s distance, not make mistakes on and off pit road and be there at the end. If there are 15 cars left and we are in a decent spot, then you get up there and race.\u201d\n\nMONSTER ENERGY SERIES PRACTICE RECAP\n\nTeam Penske driver Joey Logano and Chip Ganassi Racing\u2019s Kyle Larson led the first and final practice sessions, respectively, on Friday at Dover, Del.\n\nLogano topped opening practice for the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, posting a fast lap of 163.222 mph around the high-banked Dover one-miler. His No. 22 Ford was a full 1 mph faster than the field in that session. Hendrick Motorsports driver \u2014 and first-year playoff driver \u2014 William Byron was second best with a lap of 162.133 mph in the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet.\n\nHendrick Motorsports\u2019 Jimmie Johnson, an 11-time Dover winner, was third quickest. He turned in his fast lap only hours after his car sponsor, Ally, announced it was extending its deal with Hendrick Motorsports and the No. 48 Chevrolet team through 2023.\n\nLarson\u2019s No. 42 CGR Chevrolet was quickest in final practice with a best lap of 162.705 mph \u2014 significantly faster than Martin Truex Jr. (161.377 mph) who won the Cup race at Dover this May. Kevin Harvick, Brad Keselowski and defending race winner Chase Elliott rounded out the top five in Friday\u2019s final practice session.\n\nThe Stewart-Haas Racing driver Harvick, a two-time Dover winner, turned in the quickest 10-lap average between both sessions.\n\nXFINITY SERIES OPENING PRACTICE RECAP\n\nPlayoff driver Chase Briscoe led opening practice at Dover with a speed of 152.394 mph in the No. 98 Stewart-Haas Racing with Biagi-DenBeste Ford.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nEight drivers among the playoff mix turned in top-10 practice runs in the first session. Joining Briscoe were Christopher Bell \u2014 a two-time defending Dover race winner \u2014 and regular-season champion Tyler Reddick, six-race winner Cole Custer and veteran Justin Allgaier, who rounded out the top five. Series rookie Noah Gragson was seventh fastest.\n\nThe top eight of the current 12 playoff drivers will remain championship-eligible following Saturday\u2019s race. Brandon Jones and John Hunter Nemechek, who are tied in ninth place in the standings, were ninth and 10th, respectively, in the first session. Eighth-place Michael Annett, who is on the playoff bubble, was 14th.\n\n\u2014By Holly Cain, NASCAR Wire Service.
