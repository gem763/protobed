It was reopened in November 2017.\n\nThe sexual assault kit was sent to a private lab where male DNA was identified, police said. That DNA was entered into the law enforcement database CODIS, but there wasn't a match.\n\nThe DNA was then sent to the DNA company Parabon Nanolabs, where analysts compared the unknown crime scene sample to \"samples in various databases, including a public genealogy website with DNA samples, to provide a list of possible suspects,\" police said. On genealogy websites, many people upload DNA to connect with relatives and explore family histories.\n\nThat list of possible suspects was then narrowed down, said police, and King was one name on that list provided by Parabon.\n\nIn August detectives surveilled King and collected a discarded item, which was sent to a lab where it was determined that King's DNA was consistent with that from the 1993 crime, police said.\n\nNewark Police Department\n\nKing, now 54, was 28 years old at the time of the assault, police said. The victim and suspect were strangers, Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings said.\n\nOn Sept. 30, a grand jury indicted King for two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse, which is what the charge was called in 1993. That charge has since been changed to rape, police added.\n\nKing, of Coatesville, Pennsylvania, turned himself into Newark police on Oct. 10 and has since posted bail, police said. He is scheduled to be arraigned on Friday. No attorney is listed for him.", "description": "The suspect was 28 at the time and not known to the victim.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/jeffery-king-mgsht-aa2-191015_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
