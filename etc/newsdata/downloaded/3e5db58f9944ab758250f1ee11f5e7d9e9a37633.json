Schumer said Monday he agrees with one of President Trump\u2019s gripes about the ongoing impeachment inquiry \u2014 there is too much focus on the process.\n\nThe New York Democrat said on the Senate floor that Trump\u2019s claims that the impeachment inquiry\u2019s focus on the process was distracting from the allegations of a quid pro quo with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe president himself is saying all this stuff about process is a diversion, look at the substance. We want to look at the substance, that\u2019s what the House is doing,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.\n\n\u201cWe have a responsibility, a responsibility, a constitutional responsibility to grapple with the facts in the public record and \u2026 ultimately make ultimate judgments based on the merits of the case,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the president of the United States, in this case, happens to be right \u2014 Republicans in the House and Senate should focus on the details of the case rather than the process.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats said Monday they were planning a vote formalizing their next steps in their impeachment inquiry. The Democrats\u2019 resolution would create a procedure for impeachment hearings to ensure that they are \u201copen to the American people,\u201d according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nRepublicans have complained that there has been a lack of transparency in the House impeachment inquiry. Last week, House Republicans stormed a secure room where lawmakers had been meeting in private to work on the inquiry. Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, subsequently introduced a resolution urging the House to vote on the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
