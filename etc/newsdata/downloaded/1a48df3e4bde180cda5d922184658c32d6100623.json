Anna Holzner\n\nIt seems like there\u2019s monkey business afoot as scientists have discovered that some monkeys in Malaysia regularly kill and eat rats in the nation\u2019s vast palm oil plantations.\n\nA report released in Current Biology on Monday (Oct 21), said that researchers in Malaysia have discovered that southern pig-tailed macaques \u2013 previously thought to eat mainly fruit and, occasionally, lizards and birds \u2013 forage for rats on plantations.\n\nNadine Ruppert, co-author of the report and senior lecturer of zoology at University Sains Malaysia, said in a statement that she was \u201cstunned\u201d when she first observed the macaques feeding on plantation rats.\n\n\u201cI did not expect them to hunt these relatively large rodents or that they would even eat so much meat,\u201d she said in a press statement.\n\nRuppert also said in a Facebook post that it was \u201cquite gross\u201d to see the primates feeding on the heads of the large rats, but added that it was fascinating to see how many rats the macaques hunted, and \u201cin a very targeted and systematic way\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was intrigued by the opportunity they provide for pest management and their own conservation, as they can become an important umbrella species if forest corridors and buffers are kept within the oil palm landscape, to allow them access to the plantations,\u201d she wrote.\n\nOriginally thought as crop-raiders themselves, the report said that macaques only damage an average of 0.56 per cent of oil palm crops by eating the fruit. This is 17-fold less than the damage created by rats, which cause an average of 10 per cent crop damage.\n\nAccording to the report, damage from rats can amount to monetary losses of US$930 million (RM3.9 billion) every year.\n\nResearchers monitored two groups of pig-tailed macaques \u2013 each with around 44 monkeys \u2013 in plantations around Malaysia\u2019s Segari Melintang forest reserve between January 2016 and September 2018.\n\nThey found that each group of macaques kills an average of 3,000 rats each year, which is a 75 per cent of reduction in rat population, the report said.\n\nThis means that macaques can help to reduce crop damage from 10 per cent to less than 3 per cent, equivalent to a gain of around US$650 million per year, it added.\n\nAs such, the researchers urged plantation owners to protect macaques \u2013 which are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) \u2013 as they are a form of biological pest control, and can contribute to greener practices in oil palms.\n\n\u201cWe expect that our results will encourage both private and public plantation owners to consider the protection of these primates and their natural forest habitat in and around existing and newly established oil palm plantations,\u201d said Anja Widdig, senior author of the study.\n\nAccording to Widdig, the research will be used to work towards a plantation design that \u201cmaintains viable macaque populations and higher levels of biodiversity\u201d while \u201cincreasing the plantations\u2019 productivity and sustainability by effective and environmentally friendly pest control\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis ultimately can lead to a win-win situation for both biodiversity and the oil palm industry,\u201d she added.\n\nRead Also:", "description": "Business Insider - Macaques could reduce crop damage by rats from 10 per cent to less than 3 per cent, said researchers, equivalent to a gain of around $650 million per year..
