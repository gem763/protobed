During a season in which officiating controversies have remained prevalent, Goodell also said he believes the new system making pass interference calls and non-calls reviewable by instant replay is functioning about as originally intended.\n\nReplay for pass interference wasn\u2019t the issue Monday night, though, when the Lions suffered a loss at Green Bay on a field goal as time expired after the Packers had their winning drive extended by a hands-to-the-face penalty called on Detroit defensive lineman Trey Flowers. Troy Vincent, the NFL\u2019s executive vice president of football operations, acknowledged Tuesday that the call was incorrect.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOfficiating is always a focus for us,\u201d Goodell said Wednesday at the conclusion of a two-day NFL owners\u2019 meeting. \u201cI joke, but I\u2019m not joking: I think I\u2019m close to 40 years [in the league], and I think there\u2019s always a two- or three-week period where there\u2019s an intense focus on it. But, listen, you never want to see a game where people are talking about officials afterwards. It was a great football game played by two great teams. ... It\u2019s tough. It\u2019s tough to be in that situation.\u201d\n\nAttempting to eliminate such game-changing officiating gaffes, Goodell said, remains a top priority for Vincent and Al Riveron, the NFL\u2019s senior vice president of officiating.\n\n\u201cWe have to do everything to improve officiating,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cAl\u2019s team and Troy and everyone, we\u2019re all focusing on how do we continue to prepare our officials, obviously using technology when we can. But that\u2019s sports. You see it in every sport. We\u2019ve seen it over the last several months. So I know when you go to other press conferences, you ask the same question.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe officiating in the Lions-Packers game amplified the public conversation about the NFL\u2019s officiating that has been ongoing. The scrutiny intensified following the missed pass interference call in last season\u2019s NFC championship game in New Orleans in January that sent the Los Angeles Rams rather than the Saints to the Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only six games into the season,\u201d Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney II said Wednesday. \u201cHopefully things will even out. We passed a rule that was a controversial rule. We\u2019re going to try it for one year, and we\u2019ll see how that goes.\u201d\n\nThe officiating blunder in the NFC title game led the owners, at the behest of coaches, to ratify a rule in March making interference calls and non-calls subject to instant replay review.\n\nAD\n\nIn the early stages of this season, coaches and other observers have been critical about a lack of consistency, in their view, to the interference-related replay rulings being made by Riveron. Replay reversals of on-field interference rulings have been increasingly rare as the season has progressed.\n\nAD\n\nBut people familiar with the league\u2019s thinking previously said that NFL leaders believed the system, while imperfect, was functioning about as intended and that the onus is on coaches to adjust. Goodell\u2019s comments Wednesday seemed to reflect that viewpoint.\n\n\u201cThis is something we spent a great deal of time on back during the March period, something that the coaches felt very strongly [about]. I think they understood that replay was not going to correct every ... pass interference close call. We\u2019re not over-officiating here. \u2026 And we\u2019re not re-officiating these plays. The thought process was to correct the obvious and clear error. So I think the numbers reflect that. If it\u2019s something close and there\u2019s not obvious and clear evidence, it\u2019s going to stay the way it was called on the field. ...\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBut as you know, whenever there\u2019s a rule change, there\u2019s a period of adaption,\" Goodell continued. \"There\u2019s also a period where people are testing, the coaches are testing, to see what types of changes are going to be made. ... And I think it\u2019s settling out where we expected.\u201d\n\nOwners approved the new replay system on only a one-year basis, meaning it will be up for reconsideration after this season. Rooney said it\u2019s too soon to draw conclusions.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to give it the whole year,\u201d Rooney said, \u201cand see how it goes.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "NFL commissioner says Monday night\u2019s missed call in the Lions-Packers game was \"tough,\" but also says that officiating gets scrutinized every year.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DPC1W0saDgxmxSwOOJJ0gzbCKRw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3JDD4EHPGMI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
