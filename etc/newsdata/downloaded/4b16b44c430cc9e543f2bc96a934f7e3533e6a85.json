Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn told CNN on Thursday morning that the president \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand\u201d how the accident that killed their son has \u201cbroken\u201d their family.\n\nDunn was killed when 42-year-old American Anne Sacoolas, who is married to an intelligence officer who was working at a spy base in Croughton, England, hit his motorcycle head-on while driving down the wrong side of the road on Aug. 27. Sacoolas initially cooperated with authorities, but then left the country under diplomatic-immunity protections in early September before authorities could formally investigate her or charge her with a crime.\n\nDunn\u2019s parents had only hoped to convince Trump to send Sacoolas back to the U.K. for justice, not to meet her in person. Radd Seiger, the family spokesman, who appeared on CNN with the family, added that during the visit, new National Security Adviser Robert C. O\u2019Brien \u201csnarled\u201d at him and jeered that Sacoolas \u201cwould never return\u201d to the U.K.\n\n\u201cI used to look up to that institution,\u201d Seiger told CNN. \u201cBut it\u2019s a bunch of henchmen trying to make him look good.\u201d\n\nDuring the White House meeting, Trump surprised Dunn\u2019s parents with the announcement that Sacoolas, who they had made clear they would only meet on U.K. soil if she returned to assist the investigation, was behind a door waiting.\n\nTrump on Wednesday said he arranged the meeting at the request of U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has been very vocal about Sacoolas returning to England. Johnson had earlier insisted Sacoolas return and promised he would take the matter up personally with the president.\n\nBut on Thursday, Downing Street denied it had asked for such a meeting between Sacoolas and Dunn\u2019s parents to take place and had not been informed or involved in the planning. \u201cThe P.M. and the president spoke last Wednesday and the P.M. asked the president to do all he could to resolve the issue,\u201d a spokeswoman for the prime minister\u2019s office told The Guardian. \u201cDuring the conversation, the president raised a possibility of a meeting with Anne Sacoolas at the White House, but at that stage we weren\u2019t aware of any plans for the family to go [to the U.S.], so it wasn\u2019t discussed further.\u201d\n\nThe Sacoolas family, who have assembled a team of lawyers versed in international diplomacy and extradition, are expected to return to the U.K. this weekend.", "description": "The parents of a British teen killed by a U.S. diplomat\u2019s wife criticized new National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien for the meeting that the U.K. now denies it ever asked for.", "authors": ["Barbie Latza Nadeau"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2599,w_4621,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571320043/RTS2R3OC_jzuzpf", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
