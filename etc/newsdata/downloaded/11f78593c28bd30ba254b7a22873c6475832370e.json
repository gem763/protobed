All those MPs who promised to respect the result of the referendum have had too long to think about it.\n\nWhat she said: I knew that delivering Brexit was not going to be simple or straightforward.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It is true that initially I wanted to achieve this predominantly on the back of Conservative and DUP votes.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Who could succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader?

Who could succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader? 1/9 Boris Johnson Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has long been hopeful, he previously stood in the leadership contest that followed the Brexit vote and has at many times since been thought to be maneuvering himself towards the goal. He remains a darling of the party's right wing, particularly those in the ERG, and is the most popular choice among Tory voters but his leadership bid would be fiercely opposed by many MPs PA 2/9 Michael Gove Environment secretary Michael Gove is another member who has long wanted to be leader. He has lately been known for rousing his party in the commons, his recent speeches on the Brexit deal and Labour's no confidence motion have overshadowed the Prime Minister's. He has been loyal to the Prime Minister, partly to shed his reputation as a backstabber who abandoned Boris Johnson to stand against him in the 2016 leadership election Getty 3/9 Dominic Raab Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has emerged as a favourite to be the Brexiteer candidate in a contest to succeed to Ms May. He displayed a grip on detail in his role as Brexit secretary. When asked recently if he would like to become prime minister he replied \"never say never\" Getty 4/9 Rory Stewart International development secretary Rory Stewart is pitching himself as the sensible candidate, promising to rule out both a second referendum and a no-deal Brexit. He was only recently promoted to the cabinet, previously serving as prisons minister, where he caught headlines with a pledge to resign if he could not reduce levels of violence within a year PA 5/9 Esther McVey The former work and pensions secretary announced that she will be standing for the leadership when May leaves. McVey is the first to explicitly state that she intends to stand. She resigned from the cabinet in protest over May's Brexit deal AFP/Getty 6/9 Sajid Javid Home secretary Sajid Javid is said to have a plan in place for a leadership race. He made headlines over Christmas when he declared that people smuggling over the English channel was a \"major incident\" and more recently when he revoked the citizenship of ISIS bride Shamima Begum. Son of a bus driver, he wants the Conservatives to be seen as the party of social mobility PA 7/9 Jeremy Hunt Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt was recently thought to be the favourite in the event of a leadership race as he could sell himself as the man to unite the party. Critics worry that his long stint as health secretary could return to haunt him at a general election. He has reportedly been holding meetings with Tory MPs over breakfast to promote his leadership PA 8/9 Andrea Leadsom Following the Prime Minister's second defeat over her Brexit deal, Leader of the house Andrea Leadsom hosted a dinner party at which \"leadership was the only topic of conversation\", The Times heard. Leadsom ran against Theresa May in the 2016 leadership election before dropping out, allowing May to become Prime Minister AFP/Getty 9/9 Priti Patel Former international development secretary Priti Patel is thought to be positioning herself as a contender. One MP told The Independent \"she knows she's from the right of the party, the part which is going to choose the next leader, so she's reminding everyone she's there.\" Patel left the government late in 2017 after it emerged that she had held undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials PA 1/9 Boris Johnson Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has long been hopeful, he previously stood in the leadership contest that followed the Brexit vote and has at many times since been thought to be maneuvering himself towards the goal.

You know how that worked out.\n\nWhat she said: I sought the changes MPs demanded. I offered to give up the job I love earlier than I would like.\n\nWhat she meant: I tried to turn my own unpopularity to my advantage. Vote for my deal and get Boris for PM, I said. That didn\u2019t work either.\n\nWhat she said: We engaged in six weeks of serious talks with the opposition, offering to compromise. But in the end those talks were not enough for Labour to reach an agreement with us. But I do not think that means we should give up.\n\nWhat she meant: That would actually be the logical thing to do, but I haven\u2019t beaten Gordon Brown\u2019s length of time in office yet. That\u2019s next Wednesday.\n\nWhat she said: Today I am making a serious offer to MPs across parliament. A new Brexit deal.\n\nWhat she meant: Same as the old one, but with a slightly more convincing sales pitch. I\u2019m doing blunt truths and heartfelt emotion this time.\n\nWhat she said: As part of the new Brexit deal we will place the government under a legal obligation to seek to conclude alternative arrangements by December 2020 so that we can avoid any need for the backstop coming into force.\n\nWhat she meant: Don\u2019t like the backstop? How about a \u201clegal obligation\u201d to try really, really hard not to have one?\n\nWhat she said: We will prohibit the proposal that a future government could split Northern Ireland off from the UK\u2019s customs territory.\n\nWhat she meant: Don\u2019t like a regulatory border in the Irish Sea? How about a law \u201cprohibiting\u201d a future parliament from having one?\n\nWhat she said: The Northern Ireland assembly and executive will have to give their consent on a cross-community basis for new regulations which are added to the backstop. And we will work with our confidence and supply partners on how these commitments should be entrenched in law.\n\nWhat she meant: You can\u2019t entrench laws in this country because no parliament can bind its successor but I\u2019ve got to say something. Plus, if the DUP want to avoid a Corbyn government they\u2019re not going the right way about it.\n\nWhat she said: To those MPs who want a second referendum to confirm the deal: you need a deal and therefore a withdrawal agreement bill to make it happen.\n\nWhat she meant: But no MP advocating a second referendum wants it to confirm the deal; they want it to stop Brexit. For them, it would be much easier just to vote against the bill, so I don\u2019t know why I am wasting my time.\n\nWhat she said: Our New Brexit Deal makes a 10-point offer to everyone in parliament who wants to deliver the result of the referendum.\n\nWhat she meant: That\u2019s seven points too many for any normal person to take in, but it makes it sound like a substantial proposal instead of a cosmetic exercise.\n\nWhat she said: All of these commitments will be guaranteed in law \u2013 so they will endure at least for this parliament.\n\nWhat she meant: At least three years! You can get a guarantee on a dishwasher longer than that!\n\nWhat she said: If MPs vote against the second reading of this bill \u2013 they are voting to stop Brexit. If they do so, the consequences could hardly be greater. Reject this deal and leaving the EU with a negotiated deal any time soon will be dead in the water.\n\nWhat she meant: Along with my place in history and the Conservative Party\u2019s future. Do you Tory MPs who intend to vote against the deal really want to spend decades in the wilderness trying to organise a pact with Nigel Farage?\n\nWhat she said: Some suggest leaving without a deal. But whatever you think of that outcome \u2013 parliament has been clear it will do all it can to stop it. If not no deal, then it would have to be a general election or a second referendum that could lead to revocation \u2013 and no Brexit at all. Who believes that a general election at this moment \u2013 when we have still not yet delivered on what people instructed us to do \u2013 is in the national interest?\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Extending it for months more \u2013 perhaps indefinitely \u2013 risks opening the door to a nightmare future of permanently polarised politics.\n\nWhat she meant: Don\u2019t think you Labour MPs are going to escape the fallout from this either. Farage has got a direct line to your working-class voters, you know.\n\nWhat she said: This is a huge opportunity for the United Kingdom. Out of the EU, out of ever closer union, free to do things differently \u2026 It is practical. It is responsible. It is deliverable. And right now, it is slipping away from us.\n\nWhat she meant: I might as well tell it like it is. This is the end for me. If you MPs, Labour and Tory, want to make it the end for you too, that\u2019s your business.
