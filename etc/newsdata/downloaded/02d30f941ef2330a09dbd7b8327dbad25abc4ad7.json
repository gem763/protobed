There is an international ban on the trade in rhino horn.", "description": "Bringing local communities into mainstream conservation was vital to South African efforts aimed at curbing rhino poaching that has steadily declined from a peak of 1,215 animals killed five years ago, the environmental minister said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432565706&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L063-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
