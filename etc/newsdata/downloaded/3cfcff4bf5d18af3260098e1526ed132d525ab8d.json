In the second half we lost the ball a few times. We weren\u2019t so courageous and got into difficulties.\u201d\n\nWith Barcelona\u2019s Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen in goal in place of regular No. 1 Manuel Neuer, it was the first time Germany started without a World Cup champion on the field since winning the trophy in 2014.\n\nNiklas Stark, who had been called up six times already, had to keep waiting for his Germany debut due to gastrointestinal problems. The Hertha Berlin defender has waited longer than any other player since his initial call-up under 13 years of L\u00f6w.\n\nLeverkusen\u2019s Jonathan Tah dropped out earlier Wednesday due to flu, leaving L\u00f6w with just Niklas S\u00fcle and Koch as the only central defenders in his squad. He had already resisted calls to bring Dortmund defender Mats Hummels back after sending him to early international retirement.\n\nL\u00f6w\u2019s injury list also included Timo Werner, Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, Toni Kroos, Jonas Hector, Antonio R\u00fcdiger, Leon Goretzka, Kevin Trapp, Nico Schulz, Leroy San\u00e9, Julian Draxler and Thilo Kehrer.\n\nCounterpart Lionel Scaloni was also forced to improvise with Messi suspended for making allegations of corruption at the Copa Am\u00e9rica, and other stars missing. The visitors were all but overrun in the first half.\n\nJoshua Kimmich captained Germany for the first time and was booked for a bad challenge in the 11th, four minutes before Bayern Munich teammate Gnabry broke the deadlock after Angel Correa lost the ball in midfield. Lukas Klostermann surged forward and crossed for Gnabry, who beat three defenders to the ball before dinking it over Agustin Marchesin to score.\n\nGnabry crossed for Havertz to score in the 22nd after another lost ball in the Argentina midfield. It was the Leverkusen midfielder\u2019s first international goal.\n\nMarcel Halstenberg struck the crossbar with a free kick for Germany, before Rodrigo de Paul replied by hitting the post at the other end. It was the only real chance for Argentina before the break, when the home side was applauded off the pitch.\n\nThe visitors enjoyed more possession after the interval and Alario duly pulled one back after Marcos Acuna was left in plenty of space to cross.\n\nL\u00f6w responded by bringing on Amiri and then Serdar for their debuts, but the visitors had all the momentum.\n\nGermany endured a few scares before Ocampos finally found the equalizer after a fine run from Alario.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A weakened Argentina side came from two goals down to earn a 2-2 draw against an injury-hit Germany team in their friendly on Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/germany_argentina_soccer_04857_c0-205-5210-3242_s1770x1032.jpg?89fd5acda5b3f84f3375b6cf61eb7a9ce601db10", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
