She's sitting at the kitchen table, little legs not nearly long enough to touch the floor. Her dad walks over and leans down toward her, putting his hands on his knees.\n\nWith his face inches away from hers, he screams at her for not eating her food.\n\n\"Eat your f-ing (expletive) food,\" he says, getting louder with each word. With his handgun strapped to his hip, he tells her to say, \"yes, sir\" when she speaks to him. She does.\n\nHer stepmom is in the other room, but she doesn't intervene. She just calls her own daughter to her, away from Maddy and her dad. He keeps yelling, telling Maddy he doesn't want to hear any \"huffing and puffing.\"\n\n\"Now grab your fork, and put food in your f\u2014\" he cuts himself off, lifts his hand and slaps her across the face. Her head snaps back and she lets out a scream.\n\nThis happened in May 2018, when Maddison's dad was the chief of police in Sunray, Texas \u2014 the small panhandle town of about 2,000 people where they lived. Maddison's dad's name is Tim Dean and he's in prison now, serving a life sentence without the chance of parole.\n\nHail to the chief\n\nTim had a nice-looking r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for a cop his age. He attended the Amarillo police academy, worked his way up in the nearby Dumas Police Department for a few years. His father was a respected sergeant with the Amarillo police. Hiring him to be Sunray's police chief seemed like a no-brainer, city officials said.\n\nBut in the office and out in the field, Tim, now 34, had a problem with authority. Tom Flood, a lieutenant in Dumas who oversaw Tim while he worked there, said Tim almost failed out of the police academy, only managing to get through by leveraging his father's reputation.\n\nPoint of No Return: What drove a police chief to commit the ultimate crime? Shawn Dowd and Georgie Silvarole, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\n\nTim didn't like to be told what to do and didn't take criticism well. Flood knows why the job in Sunray appealed to him \u2014 being chief to only two other officers meant little responsibility and even less oversight. And the title carried weight.\n\nTom Flood, police lieutenant who worked with Tim Dean He had a little-man syndrome. He feels like, 'OK, I'm the chief of police of Sunray, so you're going to respect me because of who I am.' And people didn't. People laughed at him.\n\n\"He had a little-man syndrome,\" Flood said. \"He feels like, 'OK, I'm the chief of police of Sunray, so you're going to respect me because of who I am.' And people didn't. People laughed at him.\"\n\nKathy Lee, a longtime employee at Sunray's city hall, remembers when Tim became chief. He was still married to Maddy's mom and his life seemed wholesome, she said.\n\nTen days after he got the job, he purchased 10 firearms from a pawn shop on the department's dime. In Texas, Lee explained, police departments don't supply firearms. Everyone already has their own.\n\nA receipt shows the serial numbers of each gun Tim purchased; one of those guns, a Glock 9mm, is still missing.\n\nThen Tim and his wife, Kristina Hill, split. He started seeing someone new, a 20-something from New York named Charlene Childers. She hung around the police department a lot, and Tim kept the windows covered and the doors locked. People complained about seeing them making out in the parking lot.\n\nCharlene, who spent much of her formative years in upstate New York, moved to Texas in 2013. She met Tim in 2016, when they both worked at the Dumas Police Department \u2014 he was an officer, and still married to Maddy's mom, and she worked in animal control.\n\nWelcome sign in Sunray, TX. TORIN HALSEY/WICHITA FALLS TIMES RECORD NEWS\n\nTim married Charlene in March 2018. He bought a house in Sunray \u2014 a brick ranch with a big kitchen and a two-car garage \u2014 and she posted photos to Instagram of the two of them, calling him her soulmate.\n\nThey made a new home in Sunray, a tiny city plunked down in the middle of the Texas panhandle surrounded by vast fields, farms and looming white windmills.\n\nAt city hall, more than a year later, Kathy Lee fishes out a copy of their marriage license from a filing cabinet. She searches a little longer, flicking through pages for a minute, and then pulls out a second document \u2014 an arrest warrant.\n\n\"So he had bought this new home in Sunray, he had this wife, this new career as chief \u2014 everything was going (great),\" Lee says. \"And then the child abuse thing comes up.\"\n\n#familyiseverything\n\nBefore she met Tim, Charlene's life revolved around her kids. Her two oldest, Gabby and Bentley, were born in upstate New York. Her third child, Skyler, was born in 2014 to a man who lives elsewhere in Texas.\n\nShow caption Hide caption This still is from a video shared privately on Facebook in May 2018.

In the video, former police chief and convicted killer Tim Dean slaps his then 3-year-old daughter for not eating her breakfast. Dean's wife, Charlene Childers, recorded the video, which lasts 35 seconds. Video obtained by the Democrat and Chronicle/USA TODAY Network\n\nAs her relationship with Tim Dean solidified, Charlene started sharing pictures of their blended family on social media. She'd write things like #familyiseverything and #lifeisgreat in the captions. Photos of her with Tim's daughter, Maddy, appeared on her feed, mixed in with images of her own kids.\n\nBut neighbors kept a wary eye on Tim and Charlene's house. When Tim came home from work, she'd rush outside to greet him at the car \u2014 sometimes bringing a beer out to him in the driveway. He'd take out the trash and mow the lawn with a gun in his hand.\n\nThat day in May, when Tim slapped Maddy across the face, Charlene stood by their bedroom door across the room. Then she pulled out her phone and started to record.\n\nKey players: Who is Tim Dean? Read the story\n\nAs her husband screamed at his crying daughter, Charlene crept into the kitchen. She quietly called over her own daughter, moving her out of the way, then walked behind the counter, keeping distance between herself and Tim.\n\nCharlene's shaky footage shows decorative crosses hanging on the beige walls, a pair of pink cowboy boots strewn on the floor as Tim leans down to yell in Maddison's face.\n\nShe's a fraction of his size, in a pink T-shirt and purple socks, her blond hair hanging in her face. Her body shudders as her breath catches in her throat. When he raises his voice, her face crumples. Then there's the slap, and Maddy's loud cry, and the video abruptly ends.\n\nCharlene, who also goes by Charlie, shared the video with a few friends on Facebook. Kristina Hill, Tim's ex-wife and Maddy's mom, said police showed it to her three days later. It broke her heart that she couldn't protect her daughter.\n\nBut she knew why Charlene took the video \u2014 and it wasn't to help Maddy.\n\n\"Charlie was posting on Facebook about how awful she was and how she should have never married Tim because of Maddy,\" Kristina said. \"Having to be a stepmom, I think, was kind of something that she didn't really sign up for.\"\n\nAnd Charlene was used to getting what she wanted, Kristina said.\n\n\"I think she loved the idea \u2014 the chief's wife, perfect little house, to be a stay-at-home mom,\" Kristina said. \"But when things transpired the way that they did and things got nasty, I think that's when it was the end of it.\"\n\nAn empty nest\n\nTim was arrested and charged with third-degree injury to a child, a felony. The letter asking for his resignation arrived five days later. Signed by both the mayor and the city manager, the subject line read \"Termination of Employment for Good Cause.\"\n\nMortgage payments piled up, bills went unpaid, credit cards hit their limits. He took a job as a driver for Frito Lay. Rumors buzzed through town about a hit list Tim had made, with the names of the officer who arrested him and the city officials who forced his resignation.\n\nMaddy Dean Daddy used to spank me on the face.\n\nTheir house, littered with toys and decorated with drawings taped to the walls, no longer had any children playing inside. Charlene stopped posting photos of the kids online. Instead, she shared selfies with captions like \"Keeping strong. Living life to the fullest, hoping things will start looking up.\"\n\nMaddy ended up living with her mom full time. They moved to Canyon, about 70 miles from Sunray. Out of the blue, Maddy started sharing sporadic anecdotes with her mother about what living with Tim and Charlene was like.\n\nThe stories were random and blunt, almost nonchalant. Once, Maddy walked into the living room and calmly told her mom, \"Daddy used to spank me on the face.\"\n\nThis story was made possible thanks to your subscription.

She wouldn't go swimming because she had PTSD of what she would do to her.\"\n\nCharlene's own children went back to their respective fathers. The father of her youngest child lives in Texas and still let Charlene see their daughter, but a judge granted her ex-boyfriend in Sodus, New York, full custody of her two oldest children.\n\nShe fought to get them back in court a few months later. But her marriage to Tim \u2014 a man facing a felony child abuse charge \u2014 compromised the children's safety. The judge ruled that they would stay with their father, Josh Niles, in upstate New York.\n\nTim flew up to help her drive home. She had the long, 1,500-plus mile drive back to Texas to think about life without her kids. If she wanted to see them, she'd have to buy an expensive plane ticket or drive for more than 24 hours \u2014 and then work out a visit with the kids' father, who had the ability to deny it.\n\nAs they drove, Charlene suggested a drastic solution.\n\nAnd Tim agreed.\n\nPhotos posted on the Instagram account of Charlene Childers seen Thursday, Aug. 29, 2019. \"Love my life\", she wrote. SHAWN DOWD/ROCHESTER DEMOCRAT AN\n\n'To the ends of the earth'\n\nThey finalized the plan in the two-car garage of that brick ranch house in Sunray.\n\nIt was early October in 2018, and Charlene had just returned from a visit to see her kids in New York. A new wave of depression and misery consumed her. She was ready to do something about it.\n\nShe became the mastermind, and Tim would be her weapon. It was an ultimatum, and a promise: Kill Josh, get me my kids back, and we'll be happy again. Simple.\n\nTheir friend, another police officer in Sunray named Bron Bohlar, came over and helped them talk through details. They hung out in the garage, two men who had once sworn to serve and protect, and chatted about how to get away with murder: Tim would get a gun from the police department's locker, drive a rental car up to New York on a Friday, kill Josh by Sunday, and be back in time for work on Monday. No one would suspect he had even left Texas.\n\nAbout this report \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bMuch of this story was reconstructed using public records, court documents, testimonies given in court and in-person interviews. Other elements, such as the cell phone video Charlene Childers recorded, were shared with the Democrat and Chronicle for this project.\n\nBron handed over his credit card so they could rent the car in his name, hoping to make it harder for police to tie Tim to the crime. They used Tim's phone to rent it and agreed on a story in case anyone asked \u2014 that the starter on Tim's car was acting up, and that's why he needed a rental.\n\nBron and Charlene picked up the rental car from the Amarillo airport together. Tim asked Bron to make the drive to New York with him, but he told Tim he wasn't able to get off from work.\n\nTim loaded up the car and placed a large, blue plastic tote bin in the back. He filled it with guns, ammunition, some soft armor. He tossed in a black ski mask, too.\n\nOn the night of Friday, Oct. 19, 2018, Tim started driving. He was going to be a hero, or a martyr if it came down to it.\n\nA few months before, he was a police chief who hated being told what to do. Now he had marching orders from the woman who cost him his career. If he chose to carry out her plan, it would be for one reason.\n\nHis ex-wife, Kristina Hill, put it simply: \"He loved that woman to the ends of the earth.\"\n\nMore in this series\n\nPromo to part two\n\nPromo to part three\n\nPromo to profiles\n\nGSILVAROLE@Gannett.com", "description": "Tim Dean drove across the country and fatally shot Josh Niles and Amber Washburn in Sodus, NY.
