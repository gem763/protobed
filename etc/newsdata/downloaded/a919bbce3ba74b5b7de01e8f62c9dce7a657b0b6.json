He was mad about settling for field goals three times in the first half. Mad about a delay-of-game penalty and a 13-yard run on third down when he needed 15 yards. Mad to see Justin Tucker trotting on the field again for a field goal.\n\nJohn Harbaugh saw the anger, so he called timeout and gave Jackson a chance. A critical fourth down would be in the hands of Baltimore\u2019s young QB, not on the foot of its kicker.\n\n\u201cI was tired of not scoring,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nRunning an old-school power play, Jackson rolled in an on 8-yard TD on that fourth-down call. It gave the Ravens the lead for good on their way to a 30-16 win over the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday.\n\nWhether it was scrambling away from trouble or designed runs to use his speed, there was no stopping Jackson. He was the best player on the field, outshining Seattle QB Russell Wilson on a day the Seahawks star finally made his first critical mistake of the season.\n\nJackson was especially good in the second half, when he led Baltimore on a pair of crucial scoring drives. He finished with 116 yards rushing and his TD run, 143 yards passing and one of the more impressive victories in his young career.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to play against Michael Vick. I guess I\u2019m getting the new era with Lamar Jackson right there,\u201d Seattle defensive end Jadeveon Clowney said.\n\nEarl Thomas made his return to Seattle after nine seasons of playing for the Seahawks, but aside from some occasional barking at the sideline of his former team and running off the field twirling Wilson\u2019s jersey over his head after the victory, the former All-Pro safety ceded the spotlight to Jackson.\n\nThe second-year QB gave the Ravens (5-2) a 20-13 lead on his TD run. On their next possession and backed up deep in their own end, Jackson made a series of highlight plays to drive Baltimore into scoring position for Tucker\u2019s fourth field goal and a 10-point lead with 3:47 left.\n\nJackson had a 30-yard run on third-and-8 from the Ravens 12. He scrambled 13 yards for another first down and hit tight end Nick Boyle for a 20-yard completion to get the Ravens inside the Seattle 10. Baltimore went 86 yards in 13 plays and ate 9 minutes off the clock.\n\nJackson completed just 9 of 20 passes on a cold, wet day in the Pacific Northwest. He was hampered by several drops and could have had an even more dynamic performance running if not for footing problems on the wet turf. Jackson changed his shoes twice, eventually going back to his original pair.\n\n\u201cThe other ones I put in, the screw-ins, I was running slow \u2026 getting caught by the linebackers,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018I got to go back to the original ones because there\u2019s no way I can\u2019t get caught by no linebackers.\u2019 I got mad.\u201d\n\nWhile Jackson was great, he was helped by a defense that held Seattle to three points in the second half and capitalized on two turnovers.\n\nWilson was nearly flawless for the first six games but struggled to find open receivers against Baltimore\u2019s physical secondary. Seattle (5-2) was leading 10-6 and driving when Wilson made the mistake of double-clutching and trying to throw late into the flat. Marcus Peters, traded to Baltimore less than a week ago, made a quick break on the throw, stepped in front of Jaron Brown and outraced Wilson 67 yards for his fifth career interception return touchdown, the most of any player since Peters entered the league in 2015.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we got him. Make plays like that,\u201d Baltimore running back Mark Ingram said. \u201cHe has a knack for getting the ball, a knack for getting in the end zone. Shout out to our GM for getting him because that paid dividends today in getting this victory.\u201d\n\nWilson was 20 of 41 passing for 241 yards and an 8-yard TD in the first quarter to Tyler Lockett. Seattle\u2019s last hope of a comeback ended when DK Metcalf fumbled and Marlon Humphrey returned it 18 yards for a touchdown with 3:37 remaining.\n\n\u201cSomewhere you have to make a mistake,\u201d Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. \u201cHow many games are you going to go without making an error like that?\u201d\n\nRETURN OF EARL\n\nThomas had a mostly uneventful return and finished with five tackles. He caught up with a handful of his former teammates before the game and signed a few of his Seahawks jerseys still floating around. He exchanged jerseys with Wilson after the game.\n\nThomas was given the game ball after the victory.\n\n\u201cMy teammates had been telling me all week they had my back and it felt good for those guys to show up the way they did today,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt felt so good to get that win, to come here against an MVP-type quarterback and for the defense to play the way they did today, we are on the right track.\u201d\n\nINJURIES\n\nBaltimore defensive end Pernell McPhee suffered an arm injury in the first half and did not return.\n\nMISSING\n\nSeveral key starters were missing for both teams. Seattle was without starting safety Bradley McDougald (back), defensive end Ziggy Ansah (ankle) and left tackle Duane Brown (biceps). McDougald\u2019s absence meant rookie Marquise Blair made his first start and had six tackles.\n\nThe Ravens were without starting wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor, and top cornerback Jimmy Smith. Brown and Onwuasor both have ankle injuries, while Smith has a knee injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRavens: After a bye next week, Baltimore will host New England on Nov. 3.\n\nSeahawks: Seattle will travel to Atlanta next Sunday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Running an old-school power play, Jackson rolled in an on 8-yard TD on that fourth-down call.
