But if a government is not formed, it is the citizens of Israel who will pay the greatest price.\u201d\n\nRivlin said his decision was not a solution, and that both candidates were responsible for resolving the political impasse.\n\nAlthough Rivlin\u2019s duties are mostly ceremonial, he is responsible for choosing the candidate he believes has the best chance of forming a coalition government.\n\nThat is usually a straightforward task. But in last week\u2019s election, neither Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party nor Gantz\u2019s centrist Blue and White secured the required parliamentary majority needed to form a government.\n\nBlue and White party leader Benny Gantz rebuffed Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s notion of a unity government. | Sebastian Scheiner/AP Photo\n\nAccording to final official results announced Wednesday, Blue and White finished first with 33 seats in the 120-seat parliament, just ahead of Likud\u2019s 32 seats. Even with the support of smaller allies, both parties are short of the required 61-seat majority.\n\nA total of 55 lawmakers have recommended that Netanyahu lead the next government, while 54 have lined up behind Gantz. Rivlin said that after exploring all options, he concluded Netanyahu had the better chance of forming a government.\n\nNetanyahu now has a preliminary 28-day period to try to broker a deal. But his odds of success appear to be slim.\n\nBoth sides agree a unity deal is the only way out of the deadlock, but they have disagreed over who should head it.\n\nGantz has repeatedly said he will not sit with Likud as long as Netanyahu is at the helm. Facing a likely corruption indictment in the coming months, Netanyahu is desperate to remain as prime minister.\n\nIsrael\u2019s attorney general has recommended charging Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in a series of scandals.\n\nNetanyahu, who denies any wrongdoing, is to appear at a hearing with the attorney general next week, after which a final decision on charges is expected. Legal experts say the likelihood of an indictment is high. Although Netanyahu would not be required to step down if charged, he will face heavy pressure to do so.\n\nAnother key player throughout the process will be Avigdor Lieberman, whose Yisrael Beitenu party controls eight seats. Lieberman refused to endorse either candidate and is pushing for a unity government.\n\nWithout a unity deal, Netanyahu will have a tough time putting together a coalition. The secular Lieberman says he will not be part of a government that includes Netanyahu\u2019s ultra-religious allies.\n\nNetanyahu now has 28 days to form a coalition, and Rivlin having discretion to give him an additional 14 days to do so.\n\nIf Netanyahu fails, Gantz would likely be given an opportunity. And if that fails, a majority of parliament members could offer a third name to be prime minister. And if that fails, Israel would be forced into holding its third election in less than a year.\n\nLast week\u2019s election was triggered after Lieberman refused to join Netanyahu\u2019s coalition following April elections, citing what he said was excessive influence of religious parties. Instead of giving Gantz a chance to form a government, Netanyahu dissolved parliament and ordered a new election.\n\nNetanyahu said that if he fails this time, he will allow Rivlin to choose another candidate.\n\n\u201cThe nation does not want another election,\u201d Rivlin said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Benjamin Netanyahu"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/55/f2/143a7a644a32964aeb91ce6e48e0/webp.net-resizeimage%20(38).jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
