Brian\u2019s a winner.\u201d\n\nThe same age as many of his players as he finished up his political science degree in the spring of 1983, Kelly had been a two-time captain as a linebacker on the school's club football team. He brought a different approach than the one employed by the woman who hired him, Rita Castagna, who coached multiple sports and had founded the softball program in 1976.\n\nBrian Kelly (right) greets third baseman Helen Russell of the Assumption College women's softball team. Kelly was the Greyhounds' head coach from 1984-87 after serving as an assistant in 1983 under Rita Castagna. (Photo: Courtesy Assumption College)\n\n\u201cRita would try the angry face and would pull somebody from a game if they didn\u2019t do well,\u201d pitcher Kathryn (Mama) Hubbard recalls. \u201cBrian would do humor, he really would. Or maybe sarcasm or teasing, that kind of thing.\u201d\n\nWhich made Kelly the good cop?\n\n\u201cYeah, believe it or not,\u201d Hubbard says with a laugh.\n\nKelly was enshrined in the University of Cincinnati Hall of Fame last weekend along with his 2009 Bearcats team -- the last one he coached before landing his dream job at Notre Dame a decade ago. His coaching journey has taken him through Division II Grand Valley State and Central Michigan of the Mid-American Conference.\n\nBut it all began at Assumption College, a Catholic liberal arts school in Worcester, Massachusetts, close to his boyhood roots in towns such as Chelsea and Danvers. And it started with Division II women\u2019s softball, which he coached for five seasons from 1983-87.\n\nBOLD PREDICTIONS: What unexpected result to expect in Week 9\n\nIMPACT GAMES: Five matchups that will shape the playoff race\n\nSTAFF PICKS: LSU, Ohio State face major tests at home\n\n\u201cWe practiced in the front of the university, and it wasn\u2019t even a softball diamond,\u201d recalls Kelly, who turned 58 this week. \u201cIt was rocks. But they didn\u2019t care. They just wanted to play softball.\u201d\n\n'My Little Protege'\n\nThe Assumption archives are a bit misleading.\n\nThey say Castagna, a member of both the Assumption College and Sons of Italy Hall of Fame (where she\u2019s the only woman inductee), coached softball through the 1983 season, which saw the Greyhounds go 21-5, reach the NCAA tournament and set a school record for winning percentage which still stands.\n\nActually, she handed the keys to Kelly before that season started. Her duties in athletic administration were expanding \u2013 she would later become one of the first female athletic directors in the country, holding the position at Assumption from 1986-2003 \u2013 and she needed someone she could trust to do right by a talent-laden team with seven seniors in the starting lineup.\n\nThat person, she quickly determined, was Kelly. He had dated one of her basketball players, and his college roommate had dated one of the softball players, so he was a known quantity on the cozy campus with an undergraduate enrollment of about 2,100.\n\nCastagna recalls him as a \u201cvery mature 21-year-old who was respected on the football field as a player.\u201d The late Bernie Gaughan, who would hire Kelly as a football assistant after going from defensive coordinator to head coach in 1983, recommended the budding young coach.\n\nKelly also worked as a residential director and a security guard and even coached middle-school girls\u2019 basketball to make ends meet.\n\nBrian Kelly (back row, far left) with the Assumption College women's softball team he coached as an assistant in 1983 and as head coach from 1984-87 (Photo: Courtesy Assumption College)\n\nGaughan remained a trusted mentor until his death at age 80 last November, on the eve of Notre Dame\u2019s defeat of- Florida State.\n\n\u201c(Kelly\u2019s) patience and skillful teaching methods gave me an insight into what I might expect from him as my softball coach,\u201d Castagna, 76, says via email from her vacation in Aruba. \u201cHe had surely enough knowledge of the game of baseball and easily transferred that over into the game of softball.\u201d\n\nTitle IX had been law for just over a decade, and women were still fighting for opportunities at every level of competitive sports. Kelly\u2019s competitive nature ensured the Greyhounds would continue to take their sport as seriously as ever.\n\n\u201cMy advice was to not baby the girls because they were girls -- make them do the work necessary to succeed,\u201d Castagna says. \u201cHis strategy with the women was the same as if he were training the guys. He didn\u2019t hesitate to make the women work as hard as was necessary to get the job done. There was no holding back when it came to training.\u201d\n\nKelly, who had no assistant of his own, was a whirlwind of activity that spring. He would hit fungoes and throw batting practice, tweak batting stances, catch Hubbard\u2019s warmups without catching gear and structure conditioning drills that kept the team pointed toward success.\n\nOne freezing day he even had his outfielders practicing diving catches into banks of snow. There were too many rocks on the makeshift field to run such drills on a clear day.\n\nCastagna, who remained a behind-the-scenes mentor but otherwise gave Kelly full autonomy, was impressed with the young man she called \u201cmy little prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t worry for one day with Brian at the helm,\u201d she says. \u201cbecause I saw him in action for a few days when I realized I could depend on him to do the job with great confidence.\u201d\n\nShe gave the young coach her entire $1,000 stipend for coaching the team.\n\n\u201cBefore you knew it, he was doing all the work,\u201d she says. \u201cHis real success was jumping into the ring immediately, not as an assistant but (as) head honcho. He actually owns that record.\u201d\n\nJust like Carlton Fisk\n\nKelly\u2019s sideline excitability surfaced early. His former softball players smile knowingly when they see him on national television emoting and twisting his body into pretzel shapes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so funny,\u201d says Russell, an archival producer of sports documentaries who has worked for HBO and NFL Films as well as World Team Tennis and Billie Jean King. \u201cYou see him on the sidelines now, he\u2019s in the same position he was when you were rounding third coming home for Assumption on the softball field. It\u2019s the same mannerisms, the same focus, the same intensity.\u201d\n\nA member of the Assumption Hall of Fame who threw two no-hitters and went 15-4 as a senior in 1983, Hubbard would be reminded of Carlton Fisk\u2019s famous Game 6 home run for the Boston Red Sox in the 1975 World Series.\n\n\u201cMy God, the windmill (Kelly) would get going!\u201d Hubbard says. \u201cAnd his face would get all red and he was jumping. It was Carlton Fisk, but more animated than that. He was coming down the line with you.\u201d\n\nKelly jokes that he was a \u201cbad third-base coach\u201d because he \u201chad too many girls thrown out at home plate.\u201d\n\nNotre Dame football coach Brian Kelly in 2014 with three of his softball players from Assumption College's 1983 team: (l-r) left fielder Tricia (Carter) Poirier, pitcher Kate Hubbard and third baseman Helen Russell (Photo: Courtesy Kate Hubbard)\n\nEven so, Castagna says she never felt compelled to step in and ask Kelly to tone it down, even as he struggled to a 7-12 record with a revamped roster in 1984. That would be his only losing season as a softball coach and one of just three overall, with 2004 at Central Michigan and 2016 at Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cBrian\u2019s intensity was strong,\u201d she says. \u201cHe showed great patience while demanding great results. He didn\u2019t need to be reined in. His enthusiasm was apparent but certainly not to the point of being high strung. I don\u2019t recall any ejections, but if it happened it would have been because of his need to emphasize what was right.\u201d\n\nKelly\u2019s mound visits were often memorable, which should come as no surprise to any of his quarterbacks through the years. Pitch counts were not a thing back then.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d just go by feel: \u2018OK, are you going to get out of this inning or not?\u2019\" Hubbard recalls. \u201cThe pep talk at the mound, of course, he would be very stern but then he would throw a joke in there or something. He had a really good balance that way.\u201d\n\nFrom the outset, it seems Kelly was able to dance on that fine line between pushing too hard and not hard enough.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure dealing with women was a completely difference dynamic for him,\u201d says Hubbard, a retired IT executive who now does volunteer work with the elderly in Peabody, Massachusetts. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make it sound soft, but it was a little more nurturing than he probably is now.\u201d\n\nHis players appreciated the respect Kelly showed them and returned it in kind.\n\n\u201cHe was just a classy guy,\u201d Russell says. \u201cYou just knew he was going to do something with his life. he was driven. He was optimistic. He was smart. He was so obviously great at relationships. That\u2019s part of coaching, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s knowing how to motivate and what you need to do to motivate each individual.\u201d\n\n'Curb It!'\n\nSome of the best stories from Kelly\u2019s softball days involve his driving.\n\nThe hulking white, 15-passenger team van could grow quite noisy as the Greyhounds made their way to road games around the Northeast. Kelly famously surprised his players after one tough loss with a stop at the McDonald\u2019s drive-through, where he ordered burgers for the team.\n\nKelly smiles when asked if he remembers that day.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah, absolutely,\u201d he says. \u201cWe did anything that we could on a limited budget. Those gals were so fun to coach because they knew at the end of the day we were going to find ways to make it work for them through the meagerest of funds.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the famous chant of \u201cCurb It!\u201d which started after Kelly, rushing his squad to a game on an unfamiliar campus, cut a corner a little too tight. The fact he was able to laugh at himself turned that moment into a \u201crallying cry,\u201d Hubbard recalls.\n\n\u201cOh, yes, absolutely, we had to remind him each and every time,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then he would purposely curb it. It became like the good-luck charm. That was embracing the embarrassment, right? If somebody\u2019s going to tease you about something, you\u2019ve got to own it. So, he took it from then on.\u201d\n\nAsked about his trouble with the curb, Kelly pleads ignorance.\n\n\u201cMaybe I got a ticket once coming back from North Carolina,\u201d he says.\n\nHis driving, he insists with a laugh, was \u201cprobably not as bad as it\u2019s been embellished.\u201d\n\nMaybe there was a dual purpose to the pregame \u201cHail Mary\u201d that Kelly instituted in the Assumption dugout. As the team huddled and joined hands, Kelly would say, \u201cMary Queen of Victory \u2026 \u201c and wait for the shouted response of \u201cPray for us!\u201d\n\nAt the end of his debut season, the Greyhounds took up a special collection to buy the rookie coach a religious chain. The call-and-response of that dugout chant was printed on each side of the medal.\n\nThe Prize of Assumption\n\nOver his final three seasons as a softball coach, Kelly would build his win totals to 16, 18 and finally 23. If you include the 1983 season, his five-year record should be 85-59, a winning percentage of .590.\n\nEven as his football coaching duties expanded under Gaughan, Kelly continued coaching softball until he landed an assistant coaching job for $12,000 a year at Grand Valley State in faraway Michigan.\n\n\u201cIt seemed to me to be inevitable that he would go on to great places,\u201d Castagna says.\n\nKelly, inducted into the Assumption College Athletics Hall of Fame in 2006, sent along a congratulatory video for Castagna\u2019s induction in 2015. She has yet to see him coach in person since he moved to Notre Dame, but Castagna never misses a Fighting Irish game on TV.\n\n\u201cHe is the prize of Assumption and its pride and joy,\u201d she says. \u201cI was glad to be able to give him his first head coaching opportunity. I\u2019m so proud to have had him as my coach first.\u201d\n\n\u201c", "description": "Notre Dame football coach Brian Kelly's first coaching assignment came in women's softball at Assumption College, his alma mater, in the mid-1980s", "authors": ["Mike Berardino", "Published P.M.
