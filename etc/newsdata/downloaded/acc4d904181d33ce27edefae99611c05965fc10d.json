Bill Posey, R-Florida. \"There's a lot of risk in making the date, but we want to try to do it.\"\n\nAn artist's concept of a crewed Artemis mission to the moon's surface in the 2020s. NASA\n\nThe Trump administration urged NASA in March to accelerate its latest moon-landing plans by four years to 2024. The request came a few months ahead of the 50th anniversary of the first lunar footsteps by Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.\n\nRead more: 3 Apollo astronauts say they support Trump's plan to land people on the moon \u2014 but NASA would need to make two big changes\n\nNASA has named the program Artemis after Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology and promises the first moonwalking team will include a woman. The pair would land on the lunar south pole, where vast reserves of frozen water could be tapped for future explorers.\n\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine \u2014 who's pushing Artemis every chance he gets \u2014 stresses the goal is sustainability this time around, with the moon serving as a critical training ground for Mars expeditions, perhaps in the 2030s.\n\nNASA still needs a lot of space hardware to make a 2024 landing possible\n\nThis artist rendering shows an aerial view of the liftoff of the 70-metric-ton (77-ton) lift capacity configuration SLS from the launchpad. The first flight test of NASA's new rocket is scheduled for 2017. NASA's Marshall Spaceflight Center\n\nNASA's replacement for the Apollo-era Saturn V rocket \u2014 the Space Launch System or SLS \u2014 is still in development. Its launch debut has slipped repeatedly and, according to Bowersox, will now occur no earlier than the end of next year. This initial test flight will send an Orion capsule around the moon with no one on board.\n\nThe space agency still needs to come up with new lunar landers, rovers, and spacesuits.\n\nU.S. Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Florida, asked during the space subcommittee hearing why it's taking so long and costing so much for NASA \"to get back to where we were\" during Apollo. The last Apollo mission to the moon was in 1972.\n\nA prototype of NASA's xEMU spacesuit development program called the Z-2.5.

NASA's proposed mini outpost around the moon known as Gateway, from which astronauts would descend to the lunar surface, should be delayed until later missions, according to Cooke.\n\nCooke pointed out the obvious anxiety in Mission Control during the Apollo moon landings.\n\n\"It's hard enough as it is,\" he said.\n\nAs for whether private companies like SpaceX might beat NASA to the moon, Bowersox said, \"I'd still bet on us \u2014 but they might be part of our program.\"", "description": "The White House is pushing NASA to land people on the moon in 2024 with its Artemis program.
