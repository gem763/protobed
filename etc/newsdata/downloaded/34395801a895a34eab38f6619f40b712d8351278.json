Civilians and civilian infrastructure should be protected in accordance with international law.\"The UN Security Council will meet on Thursday to address Turkey's military operation, and European Commission President Jean-Claude Junker has pressed Turkey to halt its military actions.France, Germany and the UK also released a joint statement,calling Turkey's operation an act of \"jeopardizing security and humanitarian efforts.\"KIM Da-mi, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
