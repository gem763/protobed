They have been able to say \u2018the process is unfair.\u2019 We see a protest going on right now where the hearing was disrupted, and some Republican congressmen are sitting in there, but they can\u2019t defend him on substance. I just want to read you some of the quotes from the Republicans on the Hill.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying they are \u2018fed up and tired of being asked to defend the president,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cThey say there is a growing unease, that there is no defense. \u2018We can\u2019t defend the substance. All we can do is talk about the process.\u2019 Taylor\u2019s testimony is just the beginning. They don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming next. So I think the words \u2018growing unease\u2019 are an understatement for how they\u2019re feeling right now.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Wednesday's broadcast of CNN's \"Right Now,\" network correspondent Jamie Gangel said Republican lawmakers feel \"growing unease\" over defending President | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/SafariScreenSnapz001-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
