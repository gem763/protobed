Unlike the notch-busting Mi Mix line, the Mi phones don\u2019t tend to have particularly interesting designs, and Xiaomi doesn\u2019t push the prices as far down as it can with the Redmi range. The Mi phones are always just pretty good, pretty affordable phones.\n\nThe Mi 9 is a little different. It doesn\u2019t depart from the basic Mi formula of offering high-end specs in a mainstream design at a reasonable price. But more so than any other Mi series phone in the past, the ~$500 Mi 9 narrows the gap with its high-end flagship competitors even further. If you live in a country where the Mi 9 is available, there\u2019s very little reason not to give it serious consideration.\n\nOur review of Xiaomi Mi 9 Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Excellent performance\n\nFast wireless charging\n\nIncomparable value Bad Stuff No waterproofing\n\nMIUI isn\u2019t for everyone\n\nBad speaker\n\nThe Mi series has established its own design language at this point, and this continues with the Mi 9. There\u2019s the same stainless steel frame that\u2019s thinner on the sides than the top and bottom edges, leaving a curved glass panel to fill in the space. The left side of the phone has a dedicated Google Assistant button, which I could take or leave. (I would rather have it than a Bixby button.)\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a sleek, attractive device, though my \u201cpiano black\u201d review unit is more like \u201cmirrored gunmetal,\u201d and it\u2019s one of the slippier, more fingerprint-prone phones I\u2019ve seen in a while. I\u2019d probably like the iridescent purple and blue options better, not to mention the transparent model.\n\nThe screen is a 6.4-inch 1080p OLED panel with a slight chin at the bottom and a minimalist waterdrop-style notch at the top. It looks great and also houses an optical in-display fingerprint scanner, which works well enough \u2014 if not quite as quickly as Vivo\u2019s most recent implementations. Xiaomi isn\u2019t doing anything cutting edge with its display, but if you\u2019re cool with the small notch, there\u2019s little reason to complain.\n\nThe camera can also be safely classified as solid. This is Xiaomi\u2019s first phone to use a triple-lens setup, with a 16-megapixel ultrawide and a 12-megapixel 2x telephoto camera flanking the standard 48-megapixel sensor. The extra resolution is used for pixel-binning and greater light sensitivity at 12 megapixels, but unlike the Honor View 20, there\u2019s no \u201cultra clarity\u201d mode to bring out extra detail in the 48-megapixel files. You can shoot at full resolution, but it won\u2019t do much beyond giving you unnecessarily large files.\n\nI have absolutely no complaints about performance\n\nAgain, Xiaomi isn\u2019t competing with high-end competitors with advanced AI-powered HDR implementations. You\u2019re not going to get anything like the Huawei P30\u2019s mind-blowing low-light performance, but its results are broadly satisfying. Colors are well-balanced in daylight, and the night mode is pretty good for what it is. The ultrawide and telephoto cameras aren\u2019t optically stabilized, so they\u2019re not as well-suited to low-light use, but they\u2019re a welcome addition nonetheless.\n\nThe Mi 9 is one of the first phones available with Qualcomm\u2019s latest top-end Snapdragon 855 processor, and I have absolutely no complaints about its performance. MIUI, Xiaomi\u2019s version of Android, is extremely smooth on this phone, with the kind of snappy animations and buttery scrolling that I\u2019d normally only expect from OnePlus in this space. Whether I can thank the software or the hardware or \u2014 more likely \u2014 both, the Mi 9 has been fast and reliable with everything I\u2019ve thrown at it.\n\nMIUI is certainly a radical reskin of Android, and it probably won\u2019t appeal to Pixel or OnePlus purists. But it\u2019s a mature OS in its own right, and I generally find it to be thoughtfully designed and pleasant to use. The Mi 9\u2019s implementation of a full-screen gesture-based navigation system, for example, is the best I\u2019ve seen on Android, though the iPhone-style swipe from the left side of the screen to go back does take a little practice to invoke when using apps with similar gestures.\n\nXiaomi has also thrown in a couple of features that tend to be first on Chinese phone makers\u2019 cutting room floor. The Mi 9 now has the fastest wireless charging in the world, for example, despite companies like Huawei and Vivo mostly ignoring the feature. Xiaomi sells a 20W wireless charger that\u2019s a pretty great product in its own right; it has an austere white design and a rubberized finish that ensures that even the Mi 9 won\u2019t slip off. For about $15, including a 27W USB-C wired power adapter, it\u2019s a bargain.\n\nThe Mi 9 also has the best haptic feedback of any Chinese phone I\u2019ve used. It doesn\u2019t match up to Apple or LG, and it isn\u2019t used extensively throughout MIUI, but it\u2019s a step above what companies like Oppo and OnePlus are doing. While this probably isn\u2019t the most crucial feature in the world for most people, it goes some way to enhancing the sense that you\u2019re getting far more than you\u2019re paying for with the Mi 9.\n\nSo what are you missing out on if you do go for the Mi 9 over a more expensive flagship? Not a whole lot. There\u2019s no IP rating for water or dust resistance. There\u2019s only a single mono speaker on the bottom edge of the phone, and it\u2019s pretty bad. There\u2019s no headphone jack, although that isn\u2019t associated with high-end phones any more unless you\u2019re buying from Samsung or LG. The camera isn\u2019t quite world-class, but it\u2019s a perfectly usable three-lens setup.\n\nAt \u20ac449 (just over $500) for a model with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, the Mi 9 is a ridiculous bargain as long as you live somewhere it\u2019s sold. (Right now, that basically means China or Europe. There\u2019s no Indian release on the horizon, and it doesn\u2019t have broad compatibility with US LTE bands.) Xiaomi has been talking of its ambitions to launch phones in the US for several years, but it still has almost nothing to show for it.\n\nI would say this is the best value in a flagship smartphone in the world, but it\u2019s increasingly hard to say things like that as the global tech market continues to fragment. Instead, all I can say is that Xiaomi has turned in an incredibly solid product at an extremely reasonable price, and now that the company has at least some Western presence, OnePlus and Honor should be on notice.\n\nPhotography by Sam Byford / The Verge", "description": "Lightning-fast performance at a low price... if you live in the right place", "authors": ["Sam Byford", "Apr"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NvNLgXPFqCnc2oQZAF3ewYqLhJA=/0x0:2040x1068/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16103638/DSC00414.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-17"}
