Sustainable Development Goals, to create sustainable cities and communities, while driving urgent action against climate change.\n\nProfessor David Griggs, an expert in sustainable city planning, who will be attending the Symposium, commented: \u201cThe challenge of transforming a rapidly growing city in the desert into a sustainable, responsible, and inspiring place to live is enormous. The world\u2019s largest urban parks, 7.5 million trees to green the city, a 135 km sports corridor and more than 1,000 pieces of public art, are just four of the projects that will transform the city. The \u2018Riyadh\u2019s Sustainable Future\u2019 Symposium will bring together some of the world\u2019s leading experts to provide their wisdom and advice for these projects and, in doing so, help Riyadh towards a future its citizens and the world can be proud of.\u201d\n\nFor Riyadh and its citizens, the ultimate goal is to create a more sustainable city and a thriving, active community in the long term, while acting against climate change concerns. This Symposium is an important step in achieving that goal.\n\n*Source: AETOSWire\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191015005797/en/\n\nContacts\n\nArch.
