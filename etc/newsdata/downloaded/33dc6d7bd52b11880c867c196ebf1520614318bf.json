Hitchhiking has gone digital and the only thumb action you'll need is to unlock your smartphone.\n\nUnder plans drawn up in Brussels to cut carbon emissions, an app is being developed that will connect drivers who have spare seats with people needing a lift. It could soon make its way here. Hurrah, say five writers, who fondly recall their own youthful hitchhiking adventures \u2014 complete with pictures of themselves from the time...\n\nThe art of thumbing a lift could be making a comeback \u2014 albeit in a very 21st-century form\n\n13-HOUR TRIP TO FIND MY GIRL WITH A NEW FELLA\n\nRay Connolly, writer and author\n\nWhen I was 18, standing at the side of the road with my thumb out was the only way I could afford foreign travel.\n\nIt was how I first saw the Mediterranean. I'd just sat my A-levels and went travelling with Malcolm, my sister's medical student boyfriend.\n\nJust outside Calais, after many a car had raced past, an old Land Rover with British number plates pulled up. The driver was a former soldier in his 40s. He and his wife, who was in her 20s, were newlyweds on their way to his home in Australia.\n\nThat night we all slept in sleeping bags in a field near Arras. I suppose it was romantic for them.\n\nRay Connolly: When I was 18, standing at the side of the road with my thumb out was the only way I could afford foreign travel\n\nIn those pre-Autoroute days it took a week to get to the French Riviera, where the newlyweds fell out.\n\nHe'd been happy to join us in a men's hostel but, this being her honeymoon, she insisted that they find a hotel together.\n\nAt the time, I thought she was being a bit unreasonable. It was an awkward goodbye.\n\nGetting down there had been easy.\n\nHeading home, alone \u2014 Malcolm had returned early to sit an exam \u2014 was trickier.\n\nEventually, a kind soul got me to the outskirts of Paris, after which a milk van took me on an early Sunday morning tour of the Place de la Republique and the Champs Elysees. It was wonderful.\n\nFrom there, my remaining few francs just stretched far enough to get the train to Calais.\n\nBack in Dover, I was totally broke, and an English family returning from their holiday took me to London and gave me a ten-shilling note to help me on my way. It had been the greatest adventure of my life.\n\nLess happy was when, as a student, I hitchhiked 13 hours overnight from London to Lancashire to surprise my French au-pair girlfriend with whom I was in love \u2014 only to discover her at a party in bed with another boy.\n\nI took the train back to university.\n\nWE SAT IN A MANURE LORRY AS DRIVER SANG\n\nLibby Purves, writer\n\nI wouldn't stick my thumb out now, along our anonymous howling roads. And I'm glad my children didn't.\n\nThere is, of course, a magic in the kindness of strangers, in random chance encounters.\n\nEven lately I have picked up trudging figures in the rainy Suffolk lanes, optimistically thinking I can detect signs of any murderous intent through the windscreen wipers.\n\nIn the petrol crisis I drove a weary man and his can of petrol two miles to his car, having, with ridiculous sternness, inquired: 'Look, are you an axe-murderer? No? OK, hop in.'\n\nLibby Purves: I wouldn't stick my thumb out now, along our anonymous howling roads. And I'm glad my children didn't\n\nOnce, when my faulty car locked me out in a lay-by, I was ignored by many four-wheel drives and posh people-carriers, but rescued by a scruffy van and two girls from an 'erotic-punk' group banned from various European nations, called Rockbitch. Their helpfulness warms me still.\n\nGood Samaritans.\n\nEven back in my Seventies youth I didn't hitchhike in Britain: dangerous, reckless, not sensible. I saved that for teenage holidays in the West of Ireland, where buses are rare and so people help naturally.\n\nMy brother and I would head 70 miles west from the Cork ferry. Being obsessed with recording sounds (early radio career, practising all the time), I took my tape recorder.\n\nFor years afterwards, I cherished an old recording of Mike shouting 'Bastards!' at every car that swished past ignoring us.\n\nWe once sat 20 miles up front in a manure lorry, the driver so excited by my tape machine that he sang, tunelessly. ('M it stands for Mary, and J it stands for John, and P it stands for Paddy's land, where we are homeward bound.')\n\nLater, from the annoyingly remote cottage my mother preferred, we would hitch sedate lifts on a horse-drawn milk-cart to the creamery then thumb down some friendly priest or farmer on the main road into town.\n\nThose were the days. In some lonely places, they probably still are.\n\nAnd for all the risks, there's something beautiful and human about it.\n\nI BAGGED A LIFT FROM CUMBRIA TO BRAZIL\n\nStanley Johnson, writer, author and conservationist\n\nI've always looked back on the summer of 1959 as the time of my amazing hitchhiking adventure.\n\nBefore he died \u2014 in November 1956 \u2014 my maternal grandfather, Stanley Williams, generously put \u00a340 aside for me in a Post Office savings account.\n\nTwo and a half years later \u2014 in my gap-year between school and university \u2014 it came in immensely handy.\n\nIn late spring, I hitched a lift on an iron-ore carrier sailing from Workington in Cumbria to Porto Vitoria in Brazil, with the idea of spending the next few months travelling through South America.\n\nAnd that was precisely what I did. Food was cheap, and it was easy enough to find a night's lodging.\n\nStanley Johnson: I've always looked back on the summer of 1959 as the time of my amazing hitchhiking adventure\n\nLooking back, I am amazed at how much ground I covered.\n\nI travelled west through Brazil on an old steam train through Mato Grosso, then talked myself in halting Spanish into a free ride on a plane from Santa Cruz in eastern Bolivia to the capital, La Paz.\n\nThe highlight was visiting Machu Picchu in Peru, crown jewels of Peru's Inca heritage.\n\nI had some funds of my own to supplement Grandpa's largesse but by the time I got back to Brazil, they were exhausted. I had to earn some money.\n\nOne night, around the campfire on a huge plantation near Campo Grande, there was talk of a great new project that had just been launched by the Brazilian President Juscelino Kubitschek.\n\nThey needed labourers willing to work for a pittance under the blazing tropical sun.\n\n'Count me in,' I said.\n\nThere was no metalled road to Brasilia in those days, no public transport of any kind, so I hitched a lift on a lorry. Thirty-six hours later we arrived, and I found a job on a construction site.\n\nNowadays, I am in two minds about whether the construction of Brasilia \u2014 now Brazil's capital \u2014 was a good idea: it has certainly hastened the destruction of the rain forest.\n\nBut at the time I was only too pleased to earn a few cruzeiros for a day's work, and to be able to add a steak or two to a diet of rice and beans.\n\nOne day, the police arrived and asked to see my papers and work permit. Of course, I didn't have any.\n\nAt the local police station, the commandant gave his decision: 'We are going to have to fly you straight back to Rio!'\n\nSo, yes, I hitched a lift that day courtesy of the Brazilian Army.\n\nAs it happened, I was the only passenger on board.\n\nThey gave me a meal, too, and a bottle of wine.\n\nAmazingly, in Porto Vitoria, there was another cargo ship, heading for the UK laden with iron-ore. I hopped aboard.\n\n'Are you heading for Workington?' I asked.\n\n'Cardiff, actually.'\n\n'Even better,' I said. 'I'm sure there's a direct train from Cardiff to Oxford. I may just make it in time for the beginning of term!'\n\nDRIVER SOBBED OVER SPLIT WITH HIS WIFE\n\nBel Mooney, author, journalist and the Mail's advice columnist\n\nIn August 1964, aged 17, my friend and I hitchhiked ten miles to see the Rolling Stones at Longleat, Wiltshire \u2014 having assured our parents we had a lift with friends.\n\nWe got into a battered car driven by two scruffy, older men. They asked what we did and I said we were still at school. They sniggered, the atmosphere changed and I knew we had to escape.\n\nBefore central locking you could jump out at traffic lights \u2014 and so we did. Did the scare put us off? Nope. My diary records us hitching home, 'and one of our lifts was with two fabulous boys!' Incorrigible.\n\nBel Mooney: We got into a battered car driven by two scruffy, older men. They asked what we did and I said we were still at school\n\nThe following year my new boyfriend and I hitchhiked from Wiltshire to the Isle of Wight. He'd skulk behind a bush and when a car or lorry stopped for the lone girl, he'd jump out and we'd make a joke of it with the driver. It was all good-humoured; all I can remember is jolly chats with random drivers... and standing hopefully in pouring rain waggling my thumb.\n\nThe last time I hitched turned out to be rather sad, however. It was 1967 and I was a student at UCL, living in a lonely bedsit in Muswell Hill, North London.\n\nTo get there I had to catch a bus from Highgate Tube. It was late; I just missed the bus I feared was the last one.\n\nNothing for it but to walk. A van then stopped and offered a lift. Can you believe I got in?\n\nSober but reckless, I knew it was stupid but went ahead. When we got near my road the middle-aged man pulled over suddenly \u2014 and I was ready to flee or fight.\n\nBut to my amazement he leant on the steering wheel and began to weep great racking sobs. I asked what was wrong and it poured out: his wife had left him, he was depressed and lonely, he didn't want to live.\n\nMy fear was replaced by great pity. I sat in that van for about an hour, listening and coming up with what consolations I could muster.\n\nAt last he drove me the short distance to my lodgings and said thank you.\n\nI still look back and feel a chill at the terrible risk I took that night, the start of my training for a far-distant future as an advice columnist.\n\nMY MUM CHANGED A HITCHHIKER'S LIFE\n\nToby Young, journalist\n\nIt's extraordinary to think that 40 years ago, when I was a teenager, I used to hitchhike everywhere. These days, we warn our children not to get into the cars of strange men, but back then I would stand by the side of the road and literally invite them to pick me up.\n\nAged 14, I hitchhiked 200 miles to see David Bowie perform at the Hammersmith Apollo, getting into half a dozen different cars, and it didn't occur to me to be worried about my safety.\n\nEven more unbelievable is that women would sometimes stop and invite strange men to get into their cars. In fact, that's how my mother met the writer Jeremy Clarke.\n\nToby Young: It's extraordinary to think that 40 years ago, when I was a teenager, I used to hitchhike everywhere\n\nI discovered this a few years ago at the annual summer party of the Spectator, the magazine that both Jeremy and I work for.\n\nHe told me he wouldn't have become a journalist if he'd never met my mother, Sasha. I was astonished, not least because my mother died in 1993.\n\nIt turned out that he'd been hitchhiking to London at a motorway service station in Devon in the Seventies when my mother offered him a lift. He was a labourer at the time, but when he discovered Sasha was a novelist he confessed to her that he'd always dreamed of being a writer.\n\n'She told me in no uncertain terms that if I wanted to be a writer I should bloody well get on with it,' he said.\n\n'What was stopping me? It was fear of failure of course, but she said that every writer is scared of that and you just need to screw your courage to the sticking place and take the plunge.'\n\nHe told me his journalistic career began the next day.", "description": "The art of thumbing a lift could be making a comeback - albeit in a very 21st-century form.
