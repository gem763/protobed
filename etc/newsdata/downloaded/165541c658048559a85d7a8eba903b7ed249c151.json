Take Colin Powell, for example.\n\nLast Sunday the former secretary of state told CNN that U.S. foreign policy is \u201cin shambles right now, in my humble judgment.\u201d\n\nTo quote Winston Churchill, he has much to be humble about.\n\nAs secretary of state in 2003, Powell was in a position to prevent what turned out to be one of the worst foreign policy disasters in U.S. history, the invasion of Iraq over Saddam Hussein\u2019s alleged stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nInstead, he pushed aside any doubts and gave a speech at the United Nations to urge the world to war.\n\n\u201cThe facts and Iraq\u2019s behavior show that Saddam Hussein and his regime are concealing their efforts to produce more weapons of mass destruction,\u201d Powell told the U.N. on February 5, 2003.\n\nPowell showed \u201cevidence\u201d of \u201cchemical bunkers\u201d and spoke of a \u201cthick intelligence file\u201d with information about \u201cbiological weapons factories on wheels and on rails.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gravity of this moment is matched by the gravity of the threat that Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction pose to the world,\u201d Powell said.\n\nOver and over, Powell described Iraq\u2019s \u201cbehavior\u201d as it supposedly tried to deceive U.N. inspectors into believing it had no weapons of mass destruction.\n\nAnd then, as we all know, the U.S. found no weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq began just over a month after Powell\u2019s U.N. speech and the major combat operations lasted about five weeks. Then the reckoning began. In June, Newsweek reported that when military planners at Central Command were planning the invasion, they had \u201ctried to get a fix from the CIA on WMD sites they could take out with bombs and missiles.\u201d\n\nEventually, \u201cafter much badgering,\u201d the CIA let the CENTCOM planners see the intelligence on WMD sites. \u201cIt was crap,\u201d a CENTCOM planner told the magazine. The sites were mostly old buildings the U.S. had bombed in 1991, another source said.\n\nDuring the 1991 Gulf War, Colin Powell was in charge of the Army Forces Command and was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Is it plausible that he didn\u2019t recognize what the CENTCOM planners recognized?\n\nRelated Articles Is Trump more deserving of removal from office than Clinton?: Tom Campbell\n\nCalifornia\u2019s education establishment continues to fail students and families\n\nProfit over liberty: Political Cartoons\n\nGavin Newsom\u2019s performance a mixed bag so far\n\nCalChamber files sensible challenge to acrylamide signs In 2003, Powell was likely the one person in the Bush administration with the knowledge and credibility to stand up to those who were rushing to war, a war that has been endless for the United States.\n\nYet, when his judgment mattered and the fate of millions of people and trillions of dollars were on the line, he helped lay the foundation for a chaotic foreign policy inherited by Donald Trump.\n\nWhile it may be easy to forget, history didn\u2019t just begin with Trump\u2019s election.\n\nDonald Trump campaigned on ending endless wars, and if the country hadn\u2019t agreed with him, Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton (who voted for the war) might be president today.\n\nWhile President Trump has yet to actually back up his rhetoric against America\u2019s perpetual wars, Colin Powell and other Trump critics who advocated for the war in Iraq have no ground to stand on.", "description": "", "authors": ["The Editorial Board", "Opinion Section Staff Are Independent Of The News-Gathering Side Of Our Organization.
