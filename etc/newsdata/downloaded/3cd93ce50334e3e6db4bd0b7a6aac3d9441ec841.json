Cox said fire crews would also tackle structural preservation during the brief window of opportunity when wind speeds would fall below the hurricane-force levels seen over the weekend.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHeavy winds helped the fire double in size Sunday, engulfing more than 66,200 acres \u2014 roughly the size of Sacramento. As of Monday, Cal Fire officials said the fire was just 5 percent contained and is expected to burn for at least another week and a half.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has declared a statewide emergency as fires rage at both ends of the state \u2014 most recently with the Getty Fire that erupted early Monday on the western edge of Los Angeles.\n\nAt least two firefighters have suffered injuries since the Kincade blaze began late Wednesday night in Geyserville, about 75 miles northwest of San Francisco. At least 94 structures have been destroyed, including the historic Soda Rock Winery near Highway 128.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAll public meetings in Santa Rosa were also canceled for the week.\n\nMeanwhile, 1.3 million Californians in the Bay Area are without power as state utility giant Pacific Gas & Electric implemented a historically large blackout to mitigate the risk of additional fires as high winds whip around the tinder-dry region.\n\nAD\n\nPG&E also cut gas service to more than 20,000 customers \u201cto protect homes from fire,\u201d Sonoma officials said.\n\nThe utility has faced fierce criticism over its decision to cut power to so many people, including from the governor, who blamed PG&E for failing to keep its electrical systems up-to-date.\n\nOfficials have also raised concerns that the mass outages could be particularly dangerous for hospitals, nursing homes and other facilities that depend on powered medical equipment to care for their patients.\n\nOn Monday, Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie called on Newsom to explain what he was doing to ensure veterans receiving medical care would be safe during the blackouts. \u201cWith so many Veterans dependent on these necessities, the uncertainty these power outages pose is extremely troubling,\u201d Wilkie told Newsom in a letter.\n\nNearly 3,400 personnel are fighting the massive wildfire, and they will contend with a mix of windy and dry conditions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay region \u2014 particularly the North Bay, which includes Sonoma County \u2014 a relentless 36-hour period of howling, desiccating winds will come to a temporary end Monday by 11 a.m. local time. \u201cRed flag\u201d warnings are in place until that time for most of the Bay Area, for \u201ccritical\u201d fire weather that could allow wildfires to spread rapidly and exhibit extreme behavior that would make them hard to control.\n\nThe air mass over this region is at record dry levels for this time of year, and abundant vegetation after a wet winter is also extremely dry, which primes the environment for fires.\n\nThe Bay Area won\u2019t catch much of a break after Monday, however. The National Weather Service is forecasting another around of \u201cstrong, gusty, and dry offshore winds\u201d beginning midday Tuesday and lasting into Wednesday morning, and it\u2019s likely that the red flag warnings will be hoisted yet again by Monday afternoon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis looming event would be the third major \u201cDiablo wind\u201d event in seven days, something Weather Service forecasters in the region said they have no memory of occurring before. Typically these events are more spread out over time. With the next event, winds are expected to be highest in the North and East Bay hills, where gusts up to 65 mph are possible.\n\nA chief concern among forecasters and emergency officials is whether the fire will jump across Highway 101 and, according to the Los Angeles Times, \u201cignite an area that hasn\u2019t burned since the 1940s.\u201d\n\nThe mass evacuations proved controversial in some of the areas farther from the fire. On Sunday, Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said he was \u201c100 percent convinced\u201d he made the right call in ordering the mandatory evacuations Saturday and Sunday, according to the Press-Democrat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI can understand why someone in Bodega Bay is saying, \u2018C\u2019mon. What are you guys doing?\u2019 I don\u2019t take these decisions lightly,\u201d Essick said. \u201cI look at October 2017, and I still get emotional about this because I was there. \u2026 We lost 24 lives.\u201d\n\nThe 2017 Tubbs Fire in Sonoma, Napa and Lake counties killed at least 22 people and was one of the most destructive blazes in state history, incinerating more than 5,000 properties \u2014 many of them homes in Santa Rosa \u2014 and causing more than $1.2 billion in damage.\n\nNo additional evacuation orders were issued Monday as Essick acknowledged in a late-morning news conference that many residents were eager to \u201crepopulate,\u201d or return home to areas unaffected by the blaze, particularly those in the western portion of the county who remain at a distance from the fire. The sheriff promised further updates later in the day as to when people might be able to return home.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe understand people are anxious to get back to their property and may choose to ignore the evacuation order,\u201d Essick said. He directed his deputies to use \u201cintelligence and compassion\u201d when making any discretionary arrests for attempting to enter an evacuated property, known as \u201creentry.\u201d\n\nHe confirmed that deputies arrested two people over the weekend, including one man who was jailed for alleged reentry in an area he did not live in and whom deputies suspect \u201cmay have been looking for a crime of opportunity\u201d to burglarize evacuated homes.\n\nA second arrest, of a woman in Sonoma County, was for arson, though Essick called it an isolated incident unrelated to the wildfire. The woman allegedly set the fire at a residence in retaliation for what Essick characterized as a \u201cdomestic situation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs other residents fanned out to evacuation centers in the surrounding area, Rep. Jared Huffman (D) said he had confirmation from the Department of Homeland Security that there would be no immigration enforcement at local shelters.\n\nThe scene in California as wildfires spread in historic windstorm share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Oct. 28, 2019 | The Kincade Fire burns through Mayacama late Sunday night near Windsor.
