More lending should boost the economy.\n\n\u201cBut you have to have the provider ready to provide it,\u201d Fisher said, referring to the banks. \u201cWhen you make the yield curve steeper, banks become more eager to lend and as they become more eager to lend they lend to the more marginal borrower \u2014 the lower quality corporate borrower.\u201d\n\nThe yield curve remains very flat and even spent weeks in August in inverted territory, where short-term rates were higher than long-term rates. An inverted yield curve has preceded past recessions.\n\n\u201cWhat the Fed really ought to be doing is purging itself, disgorging itself of all the stupid bonds they bought in the first place during quantitative easing, which was stupid and misguided,\u201d he said.\n\nColumnist and Investor Ken Fisher speaks to Reuters in New York, April 14, 2010.

That year, the Fed took gradual steps to start to reduce its balance sheet. It began a process known as quantitative tightening. Here, the Fed would allow a small portion of its bond holdings to mature instead of reinvesting those proceeds in new bonds. This process gradually reduced the size of the balance sheet.\n\nBut the Fed ended that process in late July 2019, amid worries over slowing economic growth.\n\nYahoo Finance More\n\n\u201cRight now [the Fed should be] disgorging the bonds, pushing the price of the long bond up a little bit, steepening the yield curve because banks are in the business of taking in short-term deposits to make long-term loans, making them more eager to lend. Who wants to lend money at these rates.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, President Trump, in a tweet, called for the Fed to cut interest rates to \u201cZERO, or less.\u201d\n\nScott Gamm is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
