Photo: Courtesy of Steven Reed\n\nThe past decade has been a crash course in the limits of political \u201cfirsts.\u201d Barack Obama, the first black president of the United States, cast himself as the personification of hope, a balm for a nation scarred by racism. He was convincing because he believed it himself: His faith in the fundamental goodwill of most white Americans and understanding that, for many black ones, he heralded a degree of power few thought they\u2019d see wielded by one of their own, made his vision of a future marked by unprecedented national unity hard to resist. But short of realizing it, he was thwarted by a racist opposition and his own inclination to engage it in good faith. Perhaps worse, he was a president like most others where it counted the most: too invested in preserving his country\u2019s global military might, rigidly enforced borders, and ballooning wealth to implement radical solutions to its ills.\n\nBy the 2016 presidential election, the merits of such a first \u2014 on its own terms \u2014 had become less evident. Bernie Sanders articulated this skepticism after Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss. \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough for someone to say, \u2018I\u2019m a woman! Vote for me!\u2019\u201d he said, weeks after the election. \u201cWhat we need is a woman who has the guts to stand up to Wall Street, to the insurance companies, to the drug companies, to the fossil-fuel industry.\u201d The term \u201cidentity politics\u201d \u2014 devised originally by black feminists to describe how broader liberation derived naturally from uplifting the most oppressed \u2014 was recast as a pejorative, used to describe liberals who privileged the optics of diversity over the practice of justice, on the one hand, and on the other to decry a politics that didn\u2019t indulge white people enough. Sanders was making a case for the former. But both spelled electoral ruin for Democrats if permitted to thrive, many argued.\n\nDespite this, naught but plaudits has greeted the election on Tuesday of Steven Reed, the first black mayor-elect of Montgomery, Alabama. Reed has no governing experience to predict how he\u2019ll perform: He was previously a probate judge, and time will tell whether his verbal commitments to addressing poverty by eliminating food deserts and improving water quality come to pass. There\u2019s vast opportunity for him to affirm the warranted misgivings of anyone who argues that a brown face adorning standard Democratic orthodoxy \u2014 cultural liberalism paired with a zeal for privatization and a barely fettered free market \u2014 does little to solve any kind of inequality. But its historic nature aside, which should not be discounted, Reed\u2019s brand of first still serves what should be an integral part of any progressive agenda.\n\nFirst, if racial justice is to be a cornerstone of any political movement, its longest-serving champions should be heard. And there are few cities where they can be found more readily than in Montgomery, which in the course of a century evolved from the first capitol of the Confederacy to the cradle of the civil-rights movement. The bus boycotts organized by local activists in 1955 and 1956 \u2014 and marked by the arrests of Claudette Colvin and Rosa Parks and the neophyte leadership of Martin Luther King, Jr. \u2014 were a citywide effort, enabled not just by protesters who agitated in the streets, but by an entire black populace that refused to ride public transit and helped each other by arranging carpools, undercharging each other for cab rides, and raising money for shoes to replace those worn thin by increased walking. Participants and their descendants, biological and ideological, still abide in the city in large numbers: Montgomery is 60 percent black, backed Reed\u2019s election at a 67 percent clip among voters, and houses the headquarters for the Equal Justice Initiative, the premiere capital defense firm in the South, and the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, billed as the first memorial to the victims of American lynchings.\n\nThe import of Reed\u2019s victory isn\u2019t lost on many of them \u2014 if largely because it suggests their work isn\u2019t futile, and charts a new avenue of possibility for a community confined to the margins of influence and opportunity and the miseries that mark both for too long. \u201cI am a lifelong resident of Montgomery,\u201d resident Janay Smith told CNN. \u201cMy family, I come from maybe about four generations of activists and community leaders. Many of those who came before me are now deceased and didn\u2019t get a chance to see this. But I\u2019m so proud of my city \u2026 My city, little bitty Montgomery, Alabama, a place known for racial tension actually came together and did something positive and historic.\u201d An energized base is better equipped to facilitate progressive change than a demoralized one. Black political leadership hasn\u2019t always implemented the policies most amenable to fighting inequality and white supremacy. But it widens the spectrum of what\u2019s possible.\n\nThis may seem cosmetic until its broader implications become clear. Georgia seemed doomed to endure Republican leadership in perpetuity until Stacey Abrams came closer to winning the governor\u2019s mansion than any Democrat in decades. She ran on an agenda as far to the left as any of her national counterparts, a platform that included robust investments in green energy and expanded health care. But her approach was largely demographic, geared toward turning out nonwhite, poor, and low-frequency voters. She almost single-handedly put Georgia in play for rescue from the maw of reactionary rule. And she would\u2019ve been the first black and first woman governor in the state\u2019s history. Even having lost, she\u2019s encouraged a surge of progressive political activity, suggesting that firsts often have a compounding effect that prompts others. The potential benefits of the unknown are just that.\n\nThis is especially true for Reed, whose lack of experience both invites skepticism and shields him from the resistance that might hound a first whose record is better known and more suspect in its progressive bona fides. He\u2019ll have to prove himself, but in the meantime, firsts like his also prompt other strategic boons to materialize, most notably a delineation of the stakes of nonwhite governing, forcing the opposition to show its hand. This goes for enemies as well as putative allies: Racism for some might still be understood as an undercurrent in national politics had Obama\u2019s presidency not coaxed it out and laid bare its electoral salience, leading to the empowerment of the Tea Party and the election of Donald Trump. Firsts can also be a barometer for one\u2019s commitment to equity in leadership. A movement for justice that doesn\u2019t entrust power to the communities it most impacts risks becoming little more than a front for paternalism. These are both true even if Reed\u2019s politics disappoint. An integral part of progressivism is discarding what doesn\u2019t work, but it does itself few favors by deriding what does. And a black first in Montgomery marks the toppling of a regime however you slice it, a turning point for a black population that was integral in making black American political power possible at all. It\u2019s a first that\u2019s rich with the capacity to beget others, for the better. That\u2019s why Steven Reed matters.", "description": "Steven Reed won Montgomery, Alabama\u2019s, mayoral election on Tuesday, becoming the first black mayor in the city\u2019s history.
