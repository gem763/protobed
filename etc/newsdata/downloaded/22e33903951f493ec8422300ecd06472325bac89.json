I personally want the best for you. I wasn't going to say this in front of my family, I don't even want you to go to jail,\u201d Brandt Jean told Guyger, standing apart from his family, who were disappointed by the lenient sentence.\n\n\u201cI want the best for you because I know that's exactly what Botham would want for you,\u201d he continued. \u201cGive your life to Christ. I think giving your life to Christ is the best thing Botham would want for you.\"\n\nHe then asked the judge if he could \"please\" hug Guyger, which she allowed.\n\nThe two embraced for a long time, with Guyger sobbing.\n\nThis is what Brandt chose to say to the officer who fatally shot his brother after mistaking him for a burglar. The media would love nothing more than to turn this into divisive racial hysteria. But this is what the love of Christ does. We can all learn from this incredible man. pic.twitter.com/aC1WxJideF \u2014 Hannah Blair (@hannaheblair) October 3, 2019\n\nJudge Tammy Kemp also spoke to Guyger privately, giving her not only a hug, but also her personal Bible, instructing her to read and live John 3:16.\n\nMoments after Brandt Jean said he forgave Amber Guyger for killing his brother Botham Jean, Judge Tammy Kemp emerged from her chambers to give Gugyer a Bible. \"You just need a tiny mustard seed of faith,\u201d the judge said. \u201cYou start with this.\u201d More: https://t.co/hm1VSFp9Tv pic.twitter.com/F6bdTFkdpf \u2014 WFAA (@wfaa) October 3, 2019\n\n\"You just need a tiny mustard seed of faith,\u201d the judge said. \u201cYou start with this.\u201d", "description": ".10/03/2019 19:23:47PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/276/143396a8-7a9e-4804-befd-9b64487996e9.png"}
