This new determination is the result, in part, of selfless NR supporters \u2014 many of whom are responding to our 2019 Fall Webathon, which right now seeks your participation and generosity \u2014 who are determined to provide material assistance that will allow NR editors to spread and share the wisdom and influence of conservatism\u2019s principal voice. Our supporters\u2019 contributions make possible these special issues \u2014 and, truth to tell, all that NR publishes, either on paper or on the web.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are proud of what we have published in these special, concentrated issues. Each one alone is a solid reason for readers \u2014 may we suggest yourself? \u2014 to consider additional support for NR.\n\nReason One:\n\nThe October 14, 2019 issue provided a detailed investigation into the many costly plans that presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren proposes in order to fix (or, in reality, complicate) various problems facing America. There were 10 Warren-focused pieces, with authors including Kyle Smith (he penned the lead essay, \u201cElizabeth Warren, Cherokee from Outer Space\u201d), Samuel Hammond, Carrie Lukas, Shawn Regan, and others, each one taking to task a different Warren \u201cplan\u201d \u2014 on energy, family leave, student debt, wealth tax, payday lenders, and others \u2014 that would tear at the social fabric while costing America trillions in government spending. If you seek one-stop shopping for a thorough takedown of the progressive politician, this special issue is it.\n\nReason Two:\n\nThe May 20, 2019 issue was the first of a one-two punch, the uppercut being \u201cIn Defense of Markets.\u201d While \u201csome on the right are raising questions about free markets, or even rejecting them,\u201d editor Rich Lowry pronounced the need for this issue, as part of our (your!) heritage: \u201cNR exists to stand up for important truths, even when they are embattled or out of favor.\u201d The issue included a dozen jewels, such as Scott Lincicome\u2019s essay, \u201cThe Case for Free Trade,\u201d Other contributors included David Bahnsen, Yuval Levin, Jonah Goldberg, Kevin Williamson, Ramesh Ponnuru, and Marian Tupy.\n\nReason Three:\n\nThe following right hook came in the ensuing June 3, 2019 issue with the simple and direct cover line: Against Socialism. Rich Lowry sets the backdrop: \u201cHere we are: A self-avowed socialist nearly won the Democratic nomination in 2016 and is a serious contender this time. Another socialist, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is the hottest thing in progressive politics today. The Green New Deal and Medicare for All are proposals for sweeping aggrandizements of government power on a scale not seen in this country since the New Deal, if ever.\u201d And then a dozen pieces follow \u2014 led by Charlie Cooke\u2019s essay, \u201cSocialism Is Not Democratic,\u201d with much more from terrific contributors such as John O\u2019Sullivan, Tim Carney, Joshua Muravchik, and Andrew Stuttaford.\n\nReason Four\n\nCome the August 12, 2019 issue, Rich Lowry dedicated NR\u2019s contents to concentrate on \u201cone of the most important policy questions for conservatives to answer today.\u201d More from his explanation for why another special issue was called for:\n\nTrends over the last several decades in the economy and the culture have undercut the interests and standing of the American worker. This helped bring about the election of Donald Trump and accounts, in part, for the overwhelming populist mood of our politics. In what follows, our authors diagnose the discontents of the American worker and sketch out a pro-worker agenda, which must begin with a greater appreciation of the worth of Americans who don\u2019t have four-year college degrees.\n\nThe dozen gems in this issue included Steven Camarota\u2019s piece, \u201cUnskilled Immigration Lowers Labor-Force Participation,\u201d which was followed by penetrating articles from Robert VerBruggen, Robert Cherry, Jay Cost, Eli Lehrer, and others.\n\nReason Five:\n\nWhat can you say but, yes! Rich Lowry argued that NR spends a lot of paper and ink defending America, or proposing ways to make it better . . . but how about stepping back and just telling why we love America? Which we did in the September 9, 2019 issue, with 31 mash notes that went way beyond mom and apple pie \u2014 from Kyle Smith praising football and Stephen Hunter thrilling to plays at the plate to Terry Teachout loving Westerns and John J. Miller groovin\u2019 to Motown. It was a unique publication, and one that we believe America and Americans \u2014 no matter the political stripes \u2014 sorely needed.\n\nLet\u2019s Add a Reason Six\n\nThere is no question that NR has been America\u2019s most consistent, articulate, and influential voice on behalf of the ever-under-attack Second Amendment, and we proved that once again in the September 30, 2019 issue, which marshaled five powerful pieces \u2014 led by Robert VerBruggen\u2019s essay, \u201cDo Guns Help People Defend Themselves?\u201d (the answer is, yeah) \u2014 in defense of your right to keep and bear arms. No, the entire issue was not about \u201cguns.\u201d But the combined firepower was significant. It was . . . special.\n\nWe find every issue of National Review to be special, and we have no illusions about why we are able to hire writers, put ink on paper, print and mail: It\u2019s due to the legacy bequeathed to us by Bill Buckley, and to the good people who not only subscribe to NR, but go above and beyond and donate to this unique and very much needed institution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast Friday, October 25th, was Saint Crispin\u2019s Day. You know the speech by Henry V, inspiring his outnumbered troops before the Battle of Agincourt. We take from it that famous line:\n\nWe few, we happy few, we band of brothers.\n\nAdd sisters. And there are a quite real happy few who see this thing called National Review as vital, as a larger entity, a cause, needing perpetuation, meriting support. Maybe not blood and life and limb, but aid material, aid that inspires, as NR fights for the conservative beliefs that we mutually cherish, that we are determined to protect, that we aim to preserve for our grandchildren, and theirs.\n\nJoin the ranks of the happy few. Please donate to the 2019 Fall Webathon. Our goal is to raise $275,000 by November 10th, and more if we can. To date, some 1,800 folks have donated a total of over $250,000. Truth be told, our needs are much, much greater than this goal, so we are determined not only to meet it, but to surpass it. With your help \u2014 can you contribute $25, or $50, or maybe $100, or those of exceptional means think about $500 or $1,000 or more? \u2014 we can and will.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd by \u201cwe,\u201d we mean we. All of us in this happy band.\n\n(Brothers and sisters who prefer to join the band by check should make one payable to \u201cNational Review\u201d and mail it to National Review, ATTN: 2019 Fall Webathon, 19 West 44th Street, Suite 1701, New York, NY 10036.)\n\nP.S.: Your generous contribution supports the journalism, commentary, and opinion writing published in National Review magazine and on National Review Online.
