We just signed an LOI [letter of intent] with a great company. They want to buy the app, continue growing it for our millions of users, and take the Kin integration to the next level. Not a done deal yet, but could be a great win win. More soon.\u201d\n\nSome exciting news: we may have found a home for Kik! We just signed an LOI with a great company.

Kin is a currency used by millions of people in dozens of independent apps.\u201d\n\nKin was the subject of an SEC lawsuit earlier this year, following its $100 million ICO raise. \u201cThe SEC charges that Kik sold the tokens to U.S. investors without registering their offer and sale as required by the U.S. securities laws,\u201d the commission wrote in June.\n\nWhat the future ultimately looks like for Kik is still very unclear following the fairly cryptic tweet. We\u2019ve reached out to the company for comment.", "description": "It\u2019s been a rough run for Kik of late.
