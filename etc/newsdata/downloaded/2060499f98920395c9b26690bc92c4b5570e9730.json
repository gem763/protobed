REUTERS/Manaure Quintero/File Photo\n\nMaduro\u2019s delegation suspended its participation last month to protest a new round of U.S. sanctions, and has not yet established when it will return to the proceedings that are meant to resolve the country\u2019s political standoff.\n\nOpposition leader Juan Guaido, who has been recognized by more than 50 countries as the nation\u2019s legitimate president, has said the country needs to hold a free and fair vote following Maduro\u2019s 2018 re-election that was widely described as rigged.\n\n\u201cIt was the regime that walked out abruptly because it did not want to discuss ... what\u2019s important for the country, which is holding a free election,\u201d said legislator Stalin Gonzalez, a lead opposition negotiator.\n\nAsked when the talks will resume, Gonzalez responded \u201cthat question should be asked of the regime, if they\u2019re prepared or not to discuss the important issues.\u201d\n\nNeither Venezuela\u2019s information ministry nor Norway\u2019s foreign ministry replied to requests for comment.\n\nFour sources told Reuters last month that Maduro allies during the talks had discussed the possibility of holding a presidential vote in the coming months.\n\nThe government delegation had in theory agreed to vote on the condition that the United States lift sanctions, that Maduro run as the Socialist Party candidate, and that it be held in a year, one of the sources said.\n\nMany opposition sympathizers say Maduro uses dialogue proceedings as stalling mechanisms to burnish the international image of the ruling Socialist Party while avoiding any significant changes.\n\nMaduro accuses the opposition and the United States of seeking to overthrow him, and attributes the country\u2019s economic collapse to sanctions. His critics say it is the result of failed economic policies.", "description": "Norway-backed talks between Venezuela's opposition and the government of President Nicolas Maduro must focus on elections, an opposition negotiator said on Monday, as the dialogue proceedings remain stalled after the government walked out.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425477643&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811HW"}
