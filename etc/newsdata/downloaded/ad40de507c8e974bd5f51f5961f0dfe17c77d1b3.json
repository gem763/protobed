It is a good car full stop.\n\n\u201cNot only do attractive leases make it cheaper to run than you would think, it is environmentally-friendly and also very fast and fun to drive.\n\n\u201cIt is the first time an electric car has been named Parkers\u2019 Car of the Year, but with all the big manufacturers spending billions on developing exciting EVs, it is unlikely to be the last.\u201d\n\nThe cheapest Tesla Model 3 costs under \u00a3400 per month on finance and range anxiety - the fear that electric car batteries will run out of power quickly - could soon be a thing of the past, as it can drive up to 335 miles on one charge.\n\nAccording to Parkers\u2019 new miles-per-pound metric, the entry-level Model 3 will travel 32 miles for every \u00a31 of electricity - three times as far as a petrol or diesel equivalent.\n\nOther big winners at the awards included the Ford Focus, which scooped the Best Small Family Car prize, while the Best Large Family Car was awarded to the Skoda Superb Estate.\n\nThe Best First Car was the Renault Clio, while the \u201cutterly charming\u201d Suzuki Jimny beat SUVs costing more than twice its price to the title of Best Off-Roader.\n\nThe Volkswagen Touareg picked up the title of Best Tow Car.\n\nSWNS\n\nSearch for used cars", "description": "The new Tesla Model 3 has picked up four awards, including Car of the Year, in a string of major industry accolades for the electric model.
