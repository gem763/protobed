No one who\u2019s followed the fallout from the Times\u2019s hit piece on Kavanaugh even casually can possibly trust these two to give them the full truth.\n\nThey say they reached out to Kavanaugh and his representative for an interview while writing their book and found him willing. Naturally he\u2019d want to seize an opportunity to get his side of the story into an investigation into his past that was likely to make news. But his spokesman supposedly said that he wanted to do it off the record, no doubt figuring that going on the record would turn out to be a major publicity coup for the book and its authors. Imagine if he let himself quoted by name \u2014 \u201cKAVANAUGH SPEAKS ABOUT HIS PAST,\u201d with all the hype that would entail \u2014 and the resulting book turned out to be a hatchet job.\n\nSo he didn\u2019t want to help them promote the book by going on the record but he was willing to talk to them \u201con background.\u201d That\u2019s \u2026 a basic, basic practice in journalism, the opposite of newsworthy. But, go figure, this time it did make news:\n\nNY Times reporters say Brett Kavanaugh asked them to lie in exchange for an interview https://t.co/n0nZ2ltP6G \u2014 Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) September 19, 2019\n\n\u201cAsked them to lie\u201d? Here\u2019s what HuffPo says:\n\nNew York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly said that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed to let them interview him for their upcoming book \u2015 as long as they would publicly lie about it. Speaking at the National Press Club in Washington on Wednesday, Kelly and Pogrebin said that Kavanaugh told them he would talk to the reporters to provide them with background information as long as they falsely noted in the book that he declined to be interviewed. A representative for Kavanaugh told The Hill\u2019s chief Washington correspondent Saagar Enjeti that they asked the Times reporters to include a line saying that \u201cKavanaugh declined to comment\u201d if the justice agreed to talk with them about the book.\n\nI ask this in earnest: How is a situation like this normally handled by reporters? If you have a source that\u2019s willing to speak but only off the record, you\u2019re lying to readers at least *implicitly* by using their information in the story without acknowledging them as a source. For instance, if you\u2019re working on a story about the White House and Trump offers to set you straight \u201con background\u201d about what\u2019s happening, and then you attribute what he tells you to \u201ca source familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking,\u201d you\u2019re encouraging the reader to believe, falsely, that someone other than the president gave you the information. It\u2019s not a direct lie but it\u2019s misleading.\n\nThe difference in this case according to Pogrebin and Kelly is that Kavanaugh (per his rep) wanted them to lie *explicitly,* by including a line claiming that he declined to comment. That would have been false: He declined to comment on the record but he didn\u2019t decline to comment. I suppose they could have written \u201cKavanaugh declined to comment on the record\u201d but the last part would have been a strong clue to readers that Kavanaugh did comment on background. His fingerprints still would have been on the book. He wanted them off completely and wanted the authors to lie to make it happen. They wouldn\u2019t do it because they care about ethics \u2018n stuff, as we\u2019ve seen repeatedly this past week.\n\nConn Carroll is Mike Lee\u2019s press secretary. Here\u2019s his take on it:\n\ntelling a reporter you want to go on background and they can say you \"declined to comment for the record\" is fine bc it is true. you aren't speaking on the record. asking a reporter to say you declined to be interviewed when you were interviewed is not normal. \u2014 Conn Carroll (@conncarroll) September 19, 2019\n\nQuestion, then. In the scenario above, in which Trump talks to a reporter on background, how should the reporter address his refusal to comment on the record? If they write \u201cThe president didn\u2019t respond to repeated requests for comment,\u201d that\u2019s the same sort of out-and-out lie that Pogrebin and Kelly claim Kavanaugh wanted. He did respond to requests for comment, after all. Should the reporter instead omit any reference in the story to contacting Trump for comment? That would avoid an outright lie, but it\u2019s good journalistic practice to note that you sought comment from the subject of a story even if the subject declines to say anything. It\u2019d be weird to write a story about Trump, in which Trump commented on background, and include not a single word either way about whether the president was contacted about it.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the answer is but I also don\u2019t know why anyone would trust Kelly and Pogrebin to give the warts-and-all truth about what was said between them and Kavanaugh at this stage. In fact, Jeryl Bier asks a good question: Since their book is all about the credibility of the major players in the Kavanaugh saga, beginning with the justice himself, why didn\u2019t they include the fact that he allegedly wanted them to lie about whether he was a source? That would have been useful to readers to know. Instead they subject seems to have come up only in interviews. Why?\n\nHere they are this morning being pressed on this subject.", "description": "On background.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Hot Air Staff", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
