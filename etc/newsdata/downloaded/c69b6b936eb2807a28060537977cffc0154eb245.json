It was heartbreaking,\" the IT operations technician said.\n\n\"I was totally devastated and we never got any money back from the tour operator or insurer in relation to it.\n\n\"It got to the point where I had to go to a local walk-in centre and after tests I was told I had salmonella \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\n\"My illness lasted around 10 days all in all, but the symptoms were so bad that we had no option but to cancel our honeymoon to the Dominican Republic.\"\n\nThe wedding photographer and three members of staff at Packington Moor also fell ill in October 2017.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nCannock Magistrates Court heard the national salmonella reference laboratory was able to isolate genetically identical bacteria from 20 samples provided by some of the victims of the food poisoning, proving they were linked to eating food from a point of source.\n\nMr Kemp, who lives in Burntwood, Staffordshire, added: \"News of the prosecution is very welcome and I hope that it is an outcome that caterers across the country pay attention to and learn from.\n\n\"No one should have to go through what we have, especially in relation to their wedding day \u2013 it is just not acceptable.\n\n\"Sadly a lot of the memories about what should have been the happiest day of mine and Vikki\u2019s lives are spoilt by what happened.\n\n\"Nothing will change what has happened, but we now just hope these issues will never happen again.\"\n\n(Image: Birmingham Live WS)\n\nGalloping Gourmet (Coulsdon) Ltd pleaded guilty to two food safety breaches, which included placing unfit food on the market and failing to follow their own food safety procedures.\n\nA spokesman said: \"We can\u2019t express how sorry we are for the distress and discomfort this incident caused.\n\n\"Food safety is a responsibility we take extremely seriously. Our priority is to serve safe, tasty and well-presented food and drink to our customers, but on this isolated occasion, our food safety procedures were not followed correctly.\n\n\"We have investigated the incident thoroughly and made a significant investment in technology to improve our procedures and minimise the possibility for individual human error.\n\n\"Since we started out in 1990, we have served well over a million people and we\u2019ve never had a problem like this before. However, we have accepted full responsibility and we are confident that the changes we\u2019ve made will help ensure that this never happens again.\"", "description": "Phil Kemp and new wife Vikki, from Burntwood, Staffordshire, were forced to cancel their honeymoon after Galloping Gourmet was found liable for the error", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Birmingham Live Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20671887.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Vikki-Kemp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
