Maher then wondered if Biden has to \u201cgo away\u201d to avoid tainting the Democratic Party like former Senator Al Franken (D-MN) did.\n\nMaher said, \u201cJoe Biden has a little Ukraine problem too. He didn\u2019t answer that question too well, I thought, in the debate. He didn\u2019t own it. His son was getting 50 grand a month to do nothing in a field he knew nothing about. It\u2019s very swampy. My question is this: Al Franken had to go away for the Democrats. Because they said, well, we have to be like Caesar\u2019s wife on the #MeToo issue. We can\u2019t have any tainting on that, so that the Republicans can\u2019t say, oh, you guys are bad on that too. Doesn\u2019t the same apply to Ukraine and Joe Biden?\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "On Friday's broadcast of HBO's \"Real Time,\" host Bill Maher stated that 2020 Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden does have a | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/08/bill-maher-lecture-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
