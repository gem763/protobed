Feliciano Lopez, the 23-year-old Russian angrily snatched a towel from a ball person, threw his racket and showed the crowd his middle finger, which led to fines totalling $9,000 and a shower of boos.\n\nThe match ended with Medvedev, arms raised amid a chorus of jeers, sarcastically thanking the spectators at Louis Armstrong Stadium then telling the New York crowd to bring it on.\n\nThe crowd let him have it again after his fourth-round win over Dominik Koepfer on Sunday when he performed a dance after match point.\n\nPerhaps sensing he had squeezed as much as he could out of the bad boy ploy Medvedev stepped back on Tuesday, offering an apology for his behaviour, saying, \u201cI try to be myself guys\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy with Daniil,\u201d said Cervara. \u201cHe\u2019s smart enough to understand that if he did the wrong thing or not, if he continue to go in this way it will put more trouble for him.\n\n\u201cOf course he likes to play also with it, but he didn\u2019t cross too much the line, I would say.\u201d\n\nMedvedev has displayed plenty of mental toughness with his willingness to absorb abuse from the fans but it was his physical fitness that was the big question mark following his quarter-final win.\n\nEarly in the first set against Wawrinka the Russian was forced to take an injury time out to deal with a problem with his left quadriceps. Although he continued Medvedev said later that he had considered quitting.\n\nCervara also acknowledged the issue but dismissed it as \u201cno big deal\u201d and with two days to prepare for his semi-final would be ready to face the winner of 20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer and Grigor Dimitrov.\n\n\u201cTough. Yes, I will tell you why,\u201d said Cervara. \u201cYou see today it was tough match because he had some problem on his leg.\n\n\u201cBut still, with this, he found a way to fight and to play good tennis with this, to put Stan maybe in trouble with no game.\n\n\u201cHis mental game is getting stronger and stronger. That\u2019s one of the parts of his success in his career and today.\u201d", "description": "When Daniil Medvedev decided to take on the hostile New York crowds as well as his opponents at the U.S. Open it seemed a doomed and dangerous path to a first grand slam title.
