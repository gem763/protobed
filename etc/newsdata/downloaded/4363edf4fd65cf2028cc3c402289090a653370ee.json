The video was edited to show Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger holding up a picture of Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, golfing with a board member of the Ukrainian energy company at the center of Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens.\n\n\u201cLOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH!\u201d Trump\u2019s tweet read.\n\nBut Trump supporters\u2019 delight at the president\u2019s use of Nickelback\u2014which has long been an Internet punchline because of the perception that its songs are terrible\u2014soon turned to anger at the Canadian band after Twitter took down Trump\u2019s video for a copyright violation.\n\n\u201cMake America Hate Nickelback Again!\u201d tweeted Matt Batzel, the head of conservative training nonprofit American Majority. \u201cNickelback was thrilled they were trending on Twitter so they complained to make sure they could unite the nation against them.\u201d\n\nKristy Swanson, the Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie star who\u2019s refashioned herself as a pro-Trump celebrity, called the takedown \u201ca bunch of bull.\u201d Swanson claimed that she had bought \u201cPhotograph\u201d on iTunes because of Trump\u2019s tweet but now planned to get a refund.\n\nBut Kroeger and the rest of Nickelback weren\u2019t even behind the copyright takedown. Instead, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act complaint was filed by Warner Music Group, which appears to own the rights to \u201cPhotograph.\u201d\n\n\u201cPer our copyright policy, we respond to valid copyright complaints sent to us by a copyright owner or their authorized representatives,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson told The Daily Beast.\n\nNickelback and Warner Music Group didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nNickelback\u2019s blamelessness didn\u2019t stem the growing MAGA anger at the band. On Twitter, rank-and-file Trump supporters urged one another to reupload the video, with one claiming Nickelback \u201cblew\u201d a chance to gain a new fanbase.\n\nBreitbart reporter Brandon Darby tweeted a picture of two upraised middle-fingers at the band. Former Breitbart reporter Lee Stranahan, now a host at Russian-owned Sputnik, declared that Nickelback \u201csucks.\u201d\n\nThe anger continued on The_Donald, a Reddit community devoted to Trump. In one well-received post, a user pretended to be Kroeger and lamented that he had ruined his chance at MAGA-world fame.\n\n\u201cMy band isn't very good but the POTUS shared my song, showing it to millions of potential new fans,\u201d the post read. \u201cUnfortunately my agent is a cuck and made me remove it so I have no new fans.\u201d", "description": "Conservatives aren\u2019t looking to make the oft-mocked Canadian band great again after a copyright spat resulted in the president\u2019s video being taken off twitter.", "authors": ["Will Sommer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570124962/191003-sommer-nickelback-trump-hero_ydjk4g"}
