There are many factors but the one thing I\u2019ll tell you is that our long history together is not going to win you any concessions. If we don\u2019t do more business with you it\u2019s because you either have the wrong product offering or your pricing is wrong.\u201d Boom!\n\nEconomics aside, the faintly audible contempt that one sensed in the diplomat\u2019s words is likely shared by many Indians. Contempt because our nation, the UK, has always chosen to gloss over and show zero remorse about its colonial past yet still expects preferential treatment from one of its own former colonies. A colony that the UK left behind deeply impoverished and in turmoil.\n\nLoquacious Indian historian, Shashi Tharoor, has campaigned vigourously for an official apology for \u201cwhat the British did to India\u201d. Realistically, our government will never apologize due to the potential legal and financial ramifications, so best stop fantasizing. Frankly, I hold those members of the Indian elite who capitulated with foreign interlopers almost as culpable for the ransacking of India as I do the foreigners themselves. Who should apologize first and to whom? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a view that won\u2019t jive with the majority but there you go.\n\nWhat I find utterly loathsome though (and I say this as a proud, liberal Englishman) is Brexiteers frequently comparing the Leave EU campaign to the Indian freedom struggle or reminiscing about the good old days of the Empire. It\u2019s an offensive comparison to any Indian (or person of Indian origin like me) who\u2019s ever had to listen to older family members talk about the sacrifices that were made during the long independence campaign or the horrors of Partition. It\u2019s thoroughly repugnant to listen to those who enjoy freedoms that colonized Indians and indeed many people in the world still don\u2019t have, talk of living as \u201cslaves\u201d under so-called EU \u201crepression\u201d.\n\nThose who are demanding \u201cfreeeedom\u201d from the EU at any cost, still can\u2019t answer simple questions like: what does the EU stop us from doing in our everyday lives? Does the EU stop us from being able to elect our own leaders? Does the EU block our right to free movement? Or the right to stand for leadership? Or the ability to self-rule or run our own finances? In a word, No.\n\nIn diametrical contrast, life under British rule in India was pretty awful and humiliating. There was nothing romantic about living in the Empire, unless you were an aristocrat, a senior bureaucrat or a character in an EM Forster novel.\n\nMost Indians were neither allowed to vote nor stand for any form of leadership. Racial segregation was widely used in public places, clubs and trains. Incarceration without due process and prison torture were commonplace. It was Apartheid. Pure and simple.\n\nLeave campaigners, next time you hold an anti-EU demonstration anywhere, spare a thought for those men, women and children who perished in the massacre of Jallianwala Bagh (1919). At least 400 unarmed people were gunned down by British soldiers for \u2018illegally\u2019, albeit peacefully, gathering in a local public compound. Or when you\u2019re tucking into your Sunday roast, remember the millions who starved to death in Bengal as a direct consequence of wartime colonial policies. Living under the demonic EU regime is exactly the same isn\u2019t it?\n\nOf course it\u2019s all about education or the lack thereof. I was lucky enough to have studied in both the British and Indian school systems. I learned about our colonial history. Unfortunately, most children in the UK have never been taught about the impact their Victorian forbears had on India. How Britain became great on the broken backs of millions of people in Asia and Africa. It\u2019s almost a state secret.\n\nWhat have British ever done for India? People will say the Raj built the railways, legal system, bridges that function even today. They\u2019d be right but these were not built out of magnanimity. These were all tools that were needed to rule over our dominion. Less talked about is how we British institutionalized the Bakshish system (back handers) and subsequently set up offshore centres to squirrel away the fruits of corruption. That money still sits in exotic locations and earns interest to this day. Money that could be used instead for public benefit.\n\nSince Independence, through various aid programmes, the UK government has sought to take some moral responsibility for the plight of the poorest in India. However, UK minister Priti Patel\u2019s recent attempt to use the contributions as leverage to gain more business exposed a cynical underbelly to these initiatives. The \u2018honorable\u2019 lady forgets that people are poor in India due largely to Britain having first fleeced their country for two hundred years and then causing the biggest mass migration in history through our hand in propagating Partition.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put the Great back in Great Britain!\u201d Brexiteers declare with great vim. Alas, delusional recollections of the Empire have helped such people to forget how devastated the UK economy was post the Second World War. There was nothing great about us. Moreover, it was joining the EU trade bloc that enabled Britain to become one of the wealthiest nations on the planet.\n\nFarage, Widdecombe et al do not speak for Modern Britain. We are known for our compassion, inclusiveness and forwardness of thought. Let\u2019s not irreparably damage our brand by spouting ill-informed colonial comparisons and provocative imperial rhetoric. We need to accept our place as a small nation in the new global pecking order and focus on setting out our stall correctly. That\u2019s how we will win new business. For those of us in the UK who continue to fanaticize about pith helmets, dinner parties at the Governor General\u2019s residence or going tiger hunting on elephant back, if and when Brexit finally happens, we may just get a taste of proper colonization ourselves.", "description": "A few years ago at a soiree thrown by the British Chamber of Commerce, a very senior Indian diplomat quite forthrightly told a gathering: \u201cI\u2019ve been asked repeatedly why India doesn\u2019t give more business to...", "authors": ["Arup Ganguly"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Arup-Gnaguly.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
