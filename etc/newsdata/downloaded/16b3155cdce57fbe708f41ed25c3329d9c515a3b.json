I started laughing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018My husband came in and he was a little angry at first \u2013 until he found the humour in it too.\n\n\u2018He was upset at first that his little girl\u2019s hair was now all scattered over the floor.\n\nLuckily Jen was there to save the day (Picture: Kennedy News)\n\n\u2018Colt had definitely had a good hack away at her hair, but Jen came to the rescue. I think the hair definitely suits her more now.\n\n\u2018My son was holding the scissors up to Kimber\u2019s head and she was sitting very still and being patient with him while he cut her hair.\n\n\u2018She was completely calm and still and was just letting him do it.\n\n\u2018We explained that we don\u2019t play with scissors and you could tell Colt felt bad. We had him vacuum up the hair that he\u2019d cut off.\n\n\u2018I think he\u2019s learned his lesson \u2013 he won\u2019t be doing it again.\u2019\n\nBreana later found that her dresses also had big rips in them, so not only had Colt been cutting Kimber\u2019s hair, but his mum\u2019s dresses, too.\n\nHer hair looks great now! (Picture: Kennedy News)\n\nBut although she\u2019s not happy about the dresses, at least she likes her daughter\u2019s new hairstyle.\n\nShe said: \u2018It turned out great. I love the new hair cut \u2013 I\u2019m a little jealous and wish I got to rock something that rad looking.\n\n\u2018Kimber is very happy and so am I. Even my husband loves it now \u2013 he thinks it\u2019s adorable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She didn\u2019t realise what they were doing was wrong, and I think she enjoyed all the attention of getting her hair cut.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s very independent and she knows what she wants. As a mum, I have the most difficult time with her, but she is teaching me a lot.\n\n\u2018She knows what she wants and she knows how to get it.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not sure if Colt is destined to be a barber. Every time I get the buzzer and scissors out to cut my husband\u2019s hair, he\u2019s always begging me to let him try it.\u2019\n\nOn receiving the emergency text and restyling Kimber\u2019s hair, hairdresser Jen added: \u2018I said \u201cokay, we\u2019re going to make this cute. I\u2019m gonna figure out what I\u2019m going to do with those hard lines and we\u2019re gone make lemonade out of this\u201d.\u2019\n\nHer mum loves her new style (Picture: Kennedy News)\n\n\u2018Once I went over there and looked at it, it seemed like the only way we could embrace this with \u201clemonade\u201d was if we embraced the lines, straightened them out, and added a few more.\n\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t sure if Breana would be on board with it, so I nervously asked, but they were completely on board and completely joyed that this disaster could actually [end in] a fun little result!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It sure seemed that the entire energy about the situation was completely elevated at that moment.\n\n\u2018I got the clippers out, had fun with that right side, created a cute shape to her full cut \u2013 and rest was history!\u2019\n\nMORE: Can\u2019t remove your fake tan?
