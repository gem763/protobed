There are a few things to consider in making this move.\n\nWhat is a Booster Seat?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s define harnessed car seat versus booster seat:\n\nA car seat with 5 point harness has \u2013 you guessed it! \u2013 5 points of contact: shoulder, shoulder, hip, hip, crotch.\n\nA belt positioning booster is a device designed to position the adult-sized seat belt in the correct locations over a child\u2019s body. Boosters work by positioning the lap portion of the vehicle seat belt low on the child\u2019s hips, contacting both the hips and thighs. Boosters also align the shoulder portion of the vehicle seat belt on the child\u2019s shoulder, ideally placing the seat belt flat and snug across the collarbone. As seat belts are designed to fit fully grown adults, children need a booster to correctly position the seat belt over their small body.\n\nDifferences Between a Harnessed Car Seat and a Booster Seat\n\nThe major difference between these types of car seats is that a 5 point harness is a restraint. When a harnessed seat is properly tightened, it doesn\u2019t allow the child freedom to move out of position.\n\nMoving a child to a booster seat gives them freedom that they\u2019ve never had before: freedom to lean sideways, slouch, bother their sister, pick up a toy off the floor, and so on and so forth. If a child is wiggling out of position at the time of a crash, that leaves them vulnerable to serious injury. That means the decision to move from harness to booster is rooted in the child\u2019s maturity. The ability to sit correctly for the entire ride, 100% of the time, happens somewhere past age 5 for most kids, and not until 6 or 7 for many others.\n\nThis booster rider is 5 1/2 years old. He\u2019s been practicing riding in a booster for short trips to begin introducing him to the responsibility (an endeavor many technicians refer to as \u201cbooster training\u201d). Let me tell you how this goes. For the first few minutes, maybe even a few weeks, things are going great. You think, gosh, my kid is so mature! He\u2019s following all the rules, he\u2019s sitting up straight, we\u2019ve got this booster thing locked down! And then, something shiny detracts his focus. The inner toddler comes out, and all the sudden you\u2019ve got this happening in your backseat:\n\nMoments like this scene are when you\u2019ll know that your child just isn\u2019t quite ready for a booster seat. We\u2019ve heard legend of children who simply nod in agreement to The Rules of Booster Seats, then sit properly every time, but so far, we haven\u2019t met those children.\n\nThree Year Olds? NO!\n\nThe right time to switch to a booster seat is different for every child. However, we draw a hard line on young children riding in booster seats.\n\nDespite the 3 year age minimum listed on some booster seats, there is not a 3 year old on the planet who is ready for the responsibility of sitting properly. Let their harnessed car seat do the work of keeping them in place.\n\nFour Year Olds? ALSO NO!\n\nBecause this message is so important, we\u2019ll say it again.\n\nThe right time to switch to a booster seat is different for every child. However, we draw a hard line on the youngest children riding in booster seats before they\u2019ve outgrown their harnessed car seats.\n\nDespite the 4 year age minimum listed on some booster seats, we wouldn\u2019t advocate for placing the burden of sitting properly in a booster seat on a 4 year old child. Let their harnessed car seat do the work of keeping them in place.\n\nIn our experience, the average child gains the maturity to sit properly in a booster seat somewhere between 5 and 7 years old. And even with that minimum age, we\u2019ve met a lot of 8 year olds who still need reminders to sit properly, too.\n\nWhat about Height and Weight?\n\nMost booster seats have a lower weight threshold of 40 pounds, though some still have a 30 pound minimum weight. That\u2019s the minimum. We advocate for waiting as long as possible to move a child to the next step in any child restraints. In this case, that means waiting until the child has outgrown their harnessed car seat before transitioning to a booster seat.\n\nFor our Canadian readers, all booster seats have at least a 40 pound minimum weight. There is some concern that a smaller child may be able to submarine (slide forward in the seat and slip out of the seat belt) beneath the lap belt in a crash, however, currently available studies do not have conclusive information for this phenomenon. We do know that a properly fitted seat belt does an excellent job of protecting a child in a crash, reducing the risk for serious injury by 45% for 4-8 year olds.1\n\nThe great news is that for most kids, there is no rush whatsoever to move into a booster seat. Not too long ago there were very few 5 point harnessed seats that could hold a child who weighs over 40 pounds. Today, there is a vast array of seats to choose from that can harness the average 5-6 year old \u2013 some of those options cost as little as $50. Check out our recommended seats list if you need help making a car seat selection!\n\nIs a Harnessed Car Seat Safer than a Booster?\n\nOnce a child has outgrown their harnessed car seat, there isn\u2019t any scientific information that gives us reason to believe that a harness is safer than a properly used booster seat. The key is the booster being properly used: where the child is of appropriate age and the belt is positioned properly. NHTSA recommends utilizing a 5 point harness until the child outgrows it. There\u2019s no rush to move to a booster right away, but if your child is nearing the weight or height maximum of their harnessed car seat and is behaviorally ready to ride in a booster, don\u2019t feel that you are reducing their safety by moving to a booster.\n\nHigh Back or Backless Booster?\n\nWe tend to prefer that children start out in a high back booster simply because the structure of the high back helps remind them to sit correctly. High back boosters also usually do a better job positioning the seat belt on smaller children than their backless counterparts. If your child likes to sleep in the car, a high back booster often makes it easier for a child to sleep comfortably without slumping out of position. When your child does move to a backless booster, be sure that they have a vehicle head restraint behind their head, at least up to the tips of their ears.\n\nFive Step Test\n\nGenerally, kids will need a booster until they are 4\u20199\u2033 tall, which tends to happen somewhere around age 11. To ride without a booster, a child needs to be able to pass the 5 Step Test:\n\nSits all the way back against the vehicle seat. Knees bent at the edge of the vehicle seat and feet on the floor. Shoulder belt fits evenly across the collarbone and sits flush with the torso. Lap belt is low on the hips, touching the tops of the thighs. Can stay comfortably seated this way the entire ride.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBefore moving to a booster seat, your child should:\n\nBe at least 5 years old .\n\n. Meet the weight and height minimums for the booster seat you\u2019re considering.\n\nBe responsible enough to sit properly 100% of the time, even while asleep.\n\nHave a safe belt fit. Here\u2019s how they should look:\n\nArbogast KB, Jermakian JS, Kallan MJ, Durbin DR. Effectiveness of belt positioning booster seats: an updated assessment.
