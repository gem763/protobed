He accuses Johnson of proroguing parliament to avoid scrutiny of his Brexit strategy, or lack thereof. 'This government is a disgrace, and the way the prime minister operates is a disgrace,' he says.\n\n\n\n", "description": "British prime minister Boris Johnson tells parliament: 'We will not allow the emphatic verdict of the [Brexit] referendum to be slowly suffocated by further calculated drift and paralysis.'", "authors": ["Source"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/380e6f22a36518fc34437c379a1892f3914d0ba3/0_0_2688_1612/master/2688.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=68bfb0ee9a5504ff6c6f6bfff6626822", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
