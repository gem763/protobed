One reason? A closer bond with their parents.", "language": "en", "text": "My son is by no means the only teenager who remains firmly rooted in the passenger seat. In 1983, almost half of the nation\u2019s 16-year-olds carried a valid driver\u2019s license. By 2014, less than a quarter did, according to a study by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Experts say driving is not the only adult activity that today\u2019s teens are approaching with greater ambivalence than their counterparts in previous generations.\n\n\u201cThe whole developmental trajectory has slowed,\u201d says Jeanne Twenge, author of \u201ciGen.\u201d This trend, which cuts across demographics, represents a \u201ccultural shift,\u201d notes Twenge. It is also part of a trickle-down effect, as researchers report that 20-somethings are taking on adult responsibilities later, too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is even a name for the phenomenon marked by slowed maturation: emerging adulthood. Developed by Jeffrey Arnett, a research professor of psychology at Clark University, the term refers to the phase of life between adolescence and young adulthood, with a focus on ages 18 through 25. \u201cThirty is the new 20,\u201d says Arnett, who notes that many people are staying in school longer, marrying later and having their first child later.\n\nHe points to his own children, 19-year-old twins, as prime examples of this slower trajectory. He says they did not rush to drive, they rarely drink alcohol and they have had minimal dating experience. \u201cMy own teen years were pretty wild in comparison,\u201d Arnett says.\n\nWhereas many parents recall rebelling against their own parents and plotting ways to distance themselves \u2014 including getting their driver\u2019s license and moving out of the house \u2014 that desperate teenage desire for independence seems to have waned.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVered DeLeeuw, a recipe blogger from San Francisco and parent of 19- and 17-year-old daughters, sees it in her own children. \u201cThey enjoy our company. They don\u2019t have a burning desire to leave us and disconnect from us,\u201d says DeLeeuw, whose children did get their driver\u2019s licenses as soon as they were legally able.\n\nBaltimore-based parent Nancy Williams reports a similar experience with her 21- and 24-year-old children.\n\n'Safe' teen drinking? Here's why parents shouldn't facilitate it.\n\nPondering her own children\u2019s paths to maturation \u2014 both are in college but have fallen behind the traditional four-year trajectory \u2014 Williams says she has thought a lot about why kids are not launching the way she and her peers did. \u201cFor some, they don\u2019t see the point or derive any satisfaction from doing \u2018adult\u2019 things like driving, paying bills and being independent,\u201d she says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEmily Denbow Morrison, a high school English teacher in Maine and mother of two teens and a tween, says her 16-year-old daughter Addie does not have a driver\u2019s license or even a learner\u2019s permit. Nor is she interested in visiting colleges or getting a part-time job.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not ready yet,\u201d Morrison says. \u201cShe likes being a kid, and to her, when you\u2019re driving, working and walking around a campus where you\u2019ll be separated from your family for four years, you\u2019ve left the kid theme park.\u201d\n\nMany experts suggest teens are gravitating toward the \u201cvirtual\u201d freedom they find through their smartphones. But experts also point to a less tangible reason for the waning interest in activities emblematic of independence: an evolving parent-child dynamic.\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps this reluctance to grow up contributes somewhat to teens\u2019 well-documented drop in adult activities \u2014 including having sex, dating, drinking alcohol, working for pay, going places without parents and driving. Twenge led a broad analysis of more than 8 million U.S. adolescents between 13 and 19 years of age from 1976 to 2016 to learn whether and when they engaged in these adult activities. The research revealed a decline in engagement across all activities.\n\nAD\n\nSome examples stood out. In the early 2010s, 12th-graders got together with friends less often than eighth-graders of the 1990s. In 2015, 41 percent of high school students were having sex compared with 54 percent in 1991. Alcohol use declined among all adolescent age groups over time. And, as findings from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute study showed, so too did driving rates.\n\nWhile parents may be relieved to see the slowdown in certain risky adult-like behaviors among teens, such as alcohol use and sex, they may be more perplexed by the delay in activities emblematic of maturity, including driving. But some experts place the blame squarely on moms and dads.\n\nAD\n\nPsychotherapist Amy Morin, author of \u201c13 Things Mentally Strong People Don\u2019t Do,\u201d says many parents fail to give their teenage children the message that they are capable and competent, thereby enhancing self-doubt and preventing teens from tackling adult responsibilities with confidence.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cParents don\u2019t let them fail a project or forget their sports equipment. They\u2019ve acted more like their kids\u2019 personal concierge than their parents,\u201d Morin says. For these parents, she adds, it may be easier to continue driving their kids around than to hand over the keys.\n\nSome see the cellphone as another disabling crutch. \u201cWhen the party is on Snapchat, you don\u2019t need a driver\u2019s license,\u201d says Twenge. Today, 95 percent of teens have access to a smartphone, and 45 percent report being online \u2018almost constantly\u2019, according to data from the Pew Research Center. They crave peer interaction just as former generations did. But instead of connecting with their friends in cars, many choose to do so virtually.\n\nAD\n\nArnett acknowledges young people\u2019s lukewarm interest in taking on adult responsibilities and activities, but defends the slowdown. \u201cThey [parents] are measuring young adults\u2019 progress against that of people 30, 40 and 50 years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cThey do take on commitments. They just do it later.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nArnett sees no reason to complain about his own teenage children\u2019s decisions to drive, drink, and date later and less often than he did. \u201cI\u2019m grateful that they give their parents a lot less cause for nights lying awake than I gave mine,\u201d he says.\n\nElizabeth Heubeck is a freelance writer whose work has appeared in Newsweek, the Baltimore Sun, the Hartford Courant and other news outlets.
