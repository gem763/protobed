Vought, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget; Michael Duffey, another top Trump appointee there; and T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, a counselor at the State Department.\n\nTheir accounts could be crucial to investigators\u2019 understanding of the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withhold nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine earlier this year, a move that administration officials and at least one witness in the inquiry have said resulted from a directive from the president.\n\nMr. Vought and Mr. Duffey both played roles in freezing the aid, and investigators are eager to question them on how Mr. Trump asked for the freeze and why.\n\nThe issue is at the center of the impeachment inquiry, which is investigating whether Mr. Trump abused his power to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to incriminate Mr. Trump\u2019s political rivals. The $391 million security assistance package for Ukraine was delayed for months, as was a White House meeting between the two presidents, as Mr. Trump sought assurances that Mr. Zelensky would announce investigations of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter, and other Democrats.\n\nAll three of the officials were asked to appear in early November, suggesting that Democrats intend to continue the private phase of their investigation for several more weeks before convening public hearings.\n\nThe latest bevy of subpoenas \u2014 issued jointly by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform Committees, which are leading the investigation \u2014 will further challenge the administration\u2019s reluctance to cooperate with the inquiry. Mr. Brechbuhl is a close ally of Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and it is unclear if he will join other State Department officials in defying White House orders to ignore subpoenas and appear before the committee.", "description": "The finding came in an order directing the Justice Department to hand over secret grand jury evidence from the Mueller investigation to House impeachment investigators.", "authors": ["Charlie Savage", "Emily Cochrane"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/us/politics/25dc-impeach-sub/25dc-impeach-sub-facebookJumbo-v6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
