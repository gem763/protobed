We'd like to be playing a bit better in some regards at times, but hopefully we can put that performance out there on Saturday.\n\nNew Zealand have been relentless in the Rugby World Cup and will face Ireland in the last eight\n\nIRELAND VS NEW ZEALAND - LAST 3 MEETINGS November 5 2016: Ireland 40-29 New Zealand November 19 2016: Ireland 9-21 New Zealand November 17 2018: Ireland 16-9 New Zealand\n\n'We're very self-critical in terms of our performances and obviously after the Japan game we would have liked to have done things differently.\n\n'But we knew how good a team Japan were, so we always knew that would happen if we didn't play well, and it did happen.\n\n'So I think looking at the Scotland game last night, Japan were excellent again. They have been through the whole tournament.\n\n'They were clinical with the ball, every time Scotland gave them the ball they seemed to hold it for 20 or 30 phases.\n\n'It was pretty impressive, so I'm sure they will go on and really worry South Africa.'", "description": "Johnny Sexton has questioned the 'strange' negativity around Ireland's World Cup campaign, insisting Joe Schmidt's men are ready to peak for the All Blacks.", "authors": ["Nick Purewal"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/06/19678356-0-image-a-6_1571031016536.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
