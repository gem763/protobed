Shares of the company fell 2.6% to $82.30 following the Bristol-Myers news.\n\nThe interim analysis builds on the positive results the Opdivo-Yervoy combination has previously shown in melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, said Bristol-Myers, adding that it will present full data from the trial at an upcoming meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Saumya Sibi Joseph in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)", "description": "Shares of the company rose 5% to $56 in premarket trading.
