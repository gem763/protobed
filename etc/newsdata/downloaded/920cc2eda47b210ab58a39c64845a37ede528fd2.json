This is science.\n\nArthur Aron is a psychology professor at Stony Brook University in New York state who specializes in personal relationships.\n\nHe told Mary Hynes, host of CBC radio's Tapestry, about one of his earliest research projects \u2014 something he calls \"the shaky Bridge study,\" conducted at the University of British Columbia.\n\nAron and his team found that standing on North Vancouver's precipitous Capilano Suspension Bridge increased the likelihood people would be attracted to each other. It has to do with being frightened, a heightened physiological state.\n\n\"You're more likely to be attracted to them because you sort of misinterpret your arousal \u2014 I don't mean sexual arousal, but your physical stirred-up-ness,\" Aron said.\n\nThat's where the threat of electric shock comes in: situations of tension can lead a person to \"misattribute\" the cause of their nerves, believing them to be elicited by attraction to a nearby person, rather than the thing causing the fear.\n\nAron said this effect only occurs if the subject finds the other person \"reasonably desirable\" to begin with. If not, the opposite can happen: the subject might assume their nerves were brought on by repulsion to the person standing nearby.\n\n36 questions to build trust\n\nBeyond fear-induced crushes, Aron's research \u2014 and that of colleagues at other schools \u2014 has identified various ways people can strengthen their bonds in romance and friendship.\n\nAron's most famous study was the \"fast-friends procedure,\" which aimed at determining if it was possible to engineer a strong feeling of closeness \u2014 platonic, not romantic \u2014 between two strangers in a lab. The procedure involves a series of 36 gradually more intimate questions that two subjects ask one another. It was a success.\n\n\"It wasn't about falling in love. It was about getting close. Now, of course, if other things are in place, getting close certainly could help falling in love.\"\n\nIt wasn't long before other researchers tested the 36 questions to see their effects on established romantic couples.\n\nAron said those studies showed the \"fast-friends procedure\" does improve the satisfaction of long-term partners. But, he said, there's a way to make it even more effective:\n\n\"If two couples do it as a foursome, that is, two existing couples \u2026 each [person] answers each question, then goes on to the next. We recently did a study showing that that not only makes you feel closer to your partner, but it actually increases your passionate love, more than doing it alone as a couple.\"\n\nArthur Aron is a psychology professor at Stony Brook University in New York state, and the creator of the \"fast friends procedure.\" (John Griffin/Stony Brook University Communications)\n\nAron and his wife tried the questionnaire with another couple, \"and it was wonderful,\" he said.\n\nMake happy moments happier\n\nAnother discovery Aron put to the test in his own marriage is something called \"capitalization,\" developed by a team of researchers led by Shelly Gable of the University of California in Los Angeles.\n\n\"It turns out that celebrating your partner's successes has a bigger positive effect than supporting them when things go badly,\" he said.\n\nShortly after first hearing about the study, Aron said he had an opportunity to put it to the test: his wife had submitted a paper of her own to a highly-competitive science journal and was anxiously waiting for a reply.\n\nIf you do something exciting ... passionate \u2026 novel, with your partner, that's associated with the partner and that reinvigorates things. - Arthur Aron\n\nAron was home when the response came the journal's editor and reviewers loved the paper.\n\n\"I made a poster of that letter from the editor [and] put it on the front door for when she arrived home ... we had a great night,\" he recalled, laughing.\n\nGoing from self-expanding to long-lasting\n\nAnother idea that Aron has taken from his own research and personally field-tested is the effect of novelty on long-term relationships.\n\n\"What happens when a couple first gets together is it's very exciting \u2026 what we call 'self expanding.' You're forming something new. Your life is changing.\"\n\nBut after a while, the passion normally subsides.\n\n\"So if you do something exciting ... passionate \u2026 novel, with your partner, that's associated with the partner and that reinvigorates things.\"\n\nAron said what's novel and reinvigorating will differ from couple to couple, but it has to be different from what they normally do.\n\nFor him and his wife, Elaine, it can be a simple activity they haven't done in years, or something racier.\n\n\"We were walking back from a play and we said, 'you know, we haven't walked into a bar and hung out in years and years. Let's do that.' And that was fun. Sometimes it's more exciting. We went rafting on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. That was pretty exciting.\"\n\nAron and his wife have been together for more than fifty years, so he must be onto something.", "description": "Researcher Arthur Aron has some surprising ideas on how to make love work.
