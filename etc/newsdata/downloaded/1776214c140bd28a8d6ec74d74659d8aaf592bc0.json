Ha is the center\u2019s honorary head and a native of Yeongam County, South Jeolla. [OH JONG-CHAN]\n\nYEONGAM, South Jeolla - Korea\u2019s first center dedicated to trot, the decades-old music genre that\u2019s been recently enjoying a revival, opened its doors this Tuesday in South Jeolla\u2019s Yeongam County.The Korea Trot Music Center is a 2,200 square meter (23,680 square feet), two-story complex dedicated to sharing the genre\u2019s history since the 1930s. Trot developed during Japanese colonial rule (1910-45) and is characterized by vocal inflections and a repetitive rhythm, loosely inspired by the American foxtrot.This 10.5 billion won ($9 million) complex also features a 300-seat theater and a \u201chall of fame\u201d that spotlights trot stars of different eras, starting with 1930s crooner Ko Bok-soo to trot queen Jang Yoon-jeong of the 2000s.Many trot lovers have been eagerly awaiting the center\u2019s opening since construction began last March, but perhaps none more so than the center\u2019s first honorary head Ha Choon-hwa, the 64-year-old trot legend born in Yeongam.\u201cThis is the first step I\u2019m taking toward my final dream as a singer,\u201d Ha said last Friday when the JoongAng Ilbo caught up with her as preparations for the opening ceremony were in full swing.The center put on a spectacular show on Tuesday featuring some of the hottest trot personalities to celebrate its launch. Sul Woon-do, Ju Hyun-mi and Song Hae, all veteran singers and entertainers, made up the impressive lineup of performers.\u201cIt would have been nice if my dad lived a little longer,\u201d Ha remarked wistfully, longing for her father who had passed away in July.The center had been a dream that Ha shared with her father for a long time, the singer revealed. Ever since Ha\u2019s debut in 1961 at the tender age of 6, the elder Ha collected trot-related objects, as the trot diva continued to release hit after hit like \u201cThe Man Who Abandoned Me\u201d (1989) and \u201cA Water Bird\u201d (1971). He donated everything to Yeongam County, his hometown, seven years ago, which eventually played a key role in building the foundation for the Korea Trot Music Center. Memorabilia from Ha\u2019s career are on view in a special display at the center.But for Ha, the center\u2019s purpose goes further beyond sharing information and trot performances. In fact, the singer hopes to develop the complex into an training center for aspiring trot musicians.\u201cIt\u2019s my ultimate goal to expand the center into a school of traditional popular music,\u201d Ha explained.\u201cAlthough there are many schools of music, there aren\u2019t any that specialize in teaching trot. Applied music and trot are somewhat different as well. I want to create an environment here where people dreaming of becoming trot singers can be educated, train, practice, release music and perform. We\u2019ll start it as an academy at first, but I want to expand it to offer specialized college-level courses as well.\u201dTo provide students with the optimal experience, the center is equipped with high-quality facilities like sound and lighting systems and practice rooms, according to Ha, who admitted she was \u201calmost jealous\u201d of the younger people who will get to enjoy such resources.Ha is actually modelling the school after the Takarazuka Music School in Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. The school is the gateway for anyone who wants to join the very prestigious and century-old Takarazuka Revue, an all-female theater troupe.\u201cI found out about the music school in my teens when I saw a performance by the theater troupe for the first time during the 1970s. I was very envious. I visited Takarazuka again before the completion of our center. The school is right beside a large theater, and I plan to run the center academy similarly.\u201dFortunately for Ha and the center, there has been a huge resurgence of interest in the traditional music genre in Korea ever since TV Chosun premiered its hit competition show \u201cMiss Trot\u201d this February. Contestants of \u201cMiss Trot,\u201d including its superstar winner Song Ga-in, are about to kick off their second nationwide tour while many other TV reality and music shows are starting to produce trot-related content.\u201cI started the center without expecting things to unfold like this, but it reminds me of the saying that \u2018sincerity is the way of heaven.\u2019 The opening of the center\u2019s timing is perfect,\u201d Ha gushed.\u201cAs more young people sing trot on TV, they\u2019re beginning to believe that it\u2019s a genre that they can participate in as well.\u201dAs trot enjoys its second heyday, Ha is busier than ever. Recently, she\u2019s appeared on talk shows on KBS and MBC and began serving as judge for a special trot edition of the KBS singing competition \u201cI Like to Sing\u201d (translated) that kicked off this month.While Ha confessed that her tight schedule left her with no \u201ctime to eat or get sick,\u201d there\u2019s yet another major project that she\u2019s been working on - a new album to celebrate her upcoming 60th debut anniversary in 2021.\u201cMy main job is being a singer,\u201d Ha stressed. The singer released the song \u201cIt Rains At Masan Port\u201d last year in anticipation of the anniversary.\u201cI already have around 100 songs that I can include on my album. I don\u2019t skip a single day of practice. As much experience as I have, the public has high expectations for me. That\u2019s why I need to practice even harder.\u201dBY LEE JI-YOUNG [kim.eunjin1@joongang.co.kr]\"\uac00\uc218 \uc0dd\ud65c \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \uafc8\uc774
