Now, he\u2019s skiing, wakeboarding and taking part in other sports he enjoyed before his sudden illness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a ton of energy and I\u2019ve always been very independent, and to not be independent and be stuck in a wheelchair, which I was for a while, it drove me nuts,\u201d Breen, 47, told the hosts of the 3rd hour TODAY on Friday.\n\n\u201cShe took care of me, she had to do everything \u2014 I was like a baby,\u201d Breen said of his wife Julie. \u201cShe gave me so much help and that\u2019s part of why I wanted to be more independent, to not make her do so much stuff.\u201d\n\nKevin was one of only two men in the world with a documented case of this form of strep throat, his wife noted.\n\nThe ordeal began in December 2016, when he developed a sore throat and stomach pain on the day after Christmas. Julie remembered being concerned because Kevin never took a day off work, but felt so ill that he decided to stay home.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

The couple returned home, but had to go to the emergency room the next morning when Kevin\u2019s pain became unbearable.\n\n\"It was really terrifying,\" Julie recalled.\n\nBecause Breen\u2019s stomach was distended, he was rushed to the operating room. When surgeons opened his abdomen, they found pus everywhere, surrounding all his organs, Dr. Elizabeth Steensma, an acute care surgeon at Spectrum Health Butterworth Hospital in Grand Rapids, told TODAY in 2017.\n\nSurgeons flushed Breen\u2019s abdomen to clear out all the bacteria, but even with the germs gone, he was slipping into septic shock \u2014 he was in danger of being killed by his own body\u2019s immune response. His blood pressure plummeted and his organs started to shut down.\n\nWhen tests ultimately came back positive for strep, doctors concluded the bacteria from his throat infection had somehow traveled into his abdomen.\n\nWhile Steensma and her colleagues were able to save Breen\u2019s life, they weren\u2019t able to prevent permanent damage to his hands and feet. When a patient is in toxic shock, blood pressure plummets making it hard to get enough blood to the organs. The medications doctors use to treat the condition work by pulling blood from the extremities and shunting it to the brain and other organs necessary to keep the patient alive.\n\nBreen\u2019s hands and feet started turning black, meaning the tissue was dying, so doctors amputated his legs below the knee, his entire left hand and some of the fingers on his right hand. He spent months in grueling physical and occupational therapy.\n\n\u201cI remember telling him like, 'Kevin, you, you can cry,\u2019\u201d his wife recalled.\n\n\u201cMy response was, \u2018How I react to this is how our kids are going to perceive how, you know, we tackle challenges in life,\u2019\u201d Kevin said. \u201cI got better and I could do more things and holy cow, I can walk.\u201d\n\nHe uses prosthetic legs and a water-resistant robotic hand called the TASKA, which has 23 different grips and allows him do tasks like wash the dishes, type on a keyboard and even make the symbol for \"rock on,\u201d as he happily showed the TODAY anchors.\n\nJulie said Kevin now requires very little help from her and can help take care of himself and the couple\u2019s three children, who are 17, 7 and 5 years old.\n\nThe ordeal has brought the couple closer together.\n\n\u201cI became his full-time nurse when he first got home, and watching his unwavering determination to be independent again was so inspiring to both me and the kids,\u201d Julie said.\n\n\u201cJulie was always there for me through my ups and downs so to be able to step back up to the plate for her, means everything to me,\u201d Kevin noted.", "description": "A Michigan man who became a quadruple amputee after he developed a rare form of strep throat has returned to an active lifestyle.", "authors": ["A.
