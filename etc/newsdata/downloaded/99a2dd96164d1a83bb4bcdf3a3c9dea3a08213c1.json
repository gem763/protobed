They are curious, positively inquisitive, enthusiastic, energetic, soft, vulnerable, gentle, creative and full of life. And then you look at an average 50-year-old! Stressed, impatient, jaded, tired, not willing to learn new things, little tolerance for what doesn\u2019t suit them, hardened, strict and just wafting through life on auto pilot, merely existing and not living. I often wonder when I meet toughened, cynical, pessimistic people as to what happened in their lives to turn a lovely child into such a personality.I know that everyone has their bag of experiences that shape them to becoming who they are, and that it mustn\u2019t be wonderful being in their head or shoes. Fact is that shit happens and to everyone. No one has a pain free, stress free, trauma free life. But there are some that have taken their lives from strength to strength, while others with similar experiences simply crumble. It all boils down to attitude. All children are resilient and radiate a wonderful \u201cnever say die\u201d attitude. If you are reading this and somewhere inside you there is a recognition that this was your story, the good news is you can no longer be a victim of your past, but that you can be the architect of the future you would like to have. Most of you will say, \u201cit\u2019s fine, chal raha hai, chalne do\u201d, or in typical style want to keep the child in lockup because that\u2019s just easier, and change is uncomfortable. Shut your eyes, remember your happy space as a kid. The carefreeness of your spirit, the optimism, the giggles, the twinkle in your eyes everyone commented on. Where is that today? And why would you not want all of it back? For those of you willing to experience life again, the trick is to identify the series of experiences, be it scolding, conditioning or tragedy that led to the demise or should I say locking up of the child within. It\u2019s best done with a qualified therapist or even just sitting peacefully by yourself. Accept all of it, because it happened; embrace it because it shaped you; and release it\u2019s hold over you, because you choose differently for your life from now on. You own your today and you create your tomorrow. Go run barefoot, be silly, be fun\u2026 even if it feels alien initially. It\u2019s not so much about setting your inner child free, as it is about letting the cynical adult go.\n\n1. I am a 22-year-old girl and have been dating a guy who is 10 years older to me. He wants to get married this year while I would still like to take some time. He has been forcing me off late and has started with verbal assault as well. What should I do? Please help.\n\nIf he forces you and abuses you it means there is a complete lack of respect for your wishes, your dignity and self-respect. Worst part is that friends and relatives tell women from childhood to tolerate such stuff. It\u2019s absolutely not normal or acceptable, unless you delude yourself to think it is. You don\u2019t need help. You just need to be kind, firm and stand up for what feels right for you and to make clear any form of abuse means goodbye.\n\n2. I am a 30-year-old single mother and recently I\u2019ve met someone who I find interesting. However, sometimes I feel that he can\u2019t accept my child. I\u2019ve tried talking to him, but he says otherwise. Please help.\n\nWell, to live in suspicion and doubt is not going to lead to a positive future. So, choose to believe him, and enjoy the togetherness until he proves you otherwise.\n\n3. I\u2019m 29 and struggling to get my foothold in my profession. I fell in love with a girl who was studying. Initially, everything went smooth but as she found out I am not going to make it big, she dumped me. I really love her and is devastated and not able to concentrate. Tell me what to do, please.\n\nYou should be elated you\u2019re free of conditional love and a potential gold-digger. All break ups are difficult, and it would be abnormal to not be devastated or feel rejected and perhaps even used. It\u2019s natural and normal and time is a great healer. A decade from now when you look back at this moment you will be glad the wrong person walked away.", "description": "If you look at children you see it\u2019s so easy to make them happy, excited, laugh and play.
