He said the Fed would turn to rate cuts and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy before it turned to negative rates.\n\nKashkari repeated his views that U.S. interest rates should be lower to bolster the economy and help bring more people into the labor market and lift wages. He said he would support higher interest rates if wage growth accelerated to 3.5% or 4.0%, a level he believes could lead to higher inflation.\n\nFed officials are divided on whether the U.S. central bank should continue to reduce rates. The September rate cut, which brought the benchmark overnight lending rate to a range of 1.75% to 2.00% was passed with a 7-3 vote.\n\nInvestors widely expect the Fed to cut interest rates again when it meets on Oct. 29-30. Kashkari said that he would probably support another rate cut in October but that any further reductions should be based on economic data and developments in the trade war with China.\n\nHe does not vote on policy this year, but he will become a voting member next year.\n\nWhen asked about comments from President Donald Trump criticizing the Fed and calling Powell an \"enemy,\" Kashkari said that policymakers leave \"politics at the door\" when they come to work.\n\n\"The louder the noise gets, the harder the rhetoric, the more all of us hug data,\" he said. \"We hug analysis, and it\u2019s our true north.\" (Reporting by Jonnelle Marte; Editing by Chris Reese; Editing by Hugh Lawson)", "description": "Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari on Friday said the U.S. central bank should look into controlling the yield curve as a potential tool for monetary policy, similar to an approach used by the Bank of Japan.
