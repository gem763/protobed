Then the fracking revolution came about, and the U.S. resumed its long-lost place as the world\u2019s No. 1 oil and natural gas producer.\n\nThe result: lower oil prices for American consumers, less dependence on petrodespots, a dramatic shift from coal to natural gas for electricity generation (with concomitant benefits in carbon emissions), and hundreds of thousands of working-class jobs, including tens of thousands in swing states like Colorado and Pennsylvania.\n\nElizabeth Warren wants to kill all this.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to think that fracking is an unalloyed blessing \u2014 much less deny that tough safety standards are necessary \u2014 to acknowledge its benefits. You might also argue that curbs on oil and gas production are needed both to preserve the environment and accelerate a transition to renewables. Fine.\n\nYet it takes a peculiar sort of political audacity to pledge, as the Massachusetts senator did last month, to \u201cban fracking \u2014 everywhere.\u201d Warren also favors a ban on fossil-fuel exports \u2014 another U.S. industry that has seen dramatic growth in recent years \u2014 and a \u201ctotal moratorium\u201d on new fossil fuel leases on federal lands, which generate billions every year in federal and state tax revenue.", "description": "Those with plans for everything prove only that they can\u2019t be trusted to plan for anything.", "authors": ["Bret Stephens"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/opinion/25Stephens-2/25Stephens-2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
