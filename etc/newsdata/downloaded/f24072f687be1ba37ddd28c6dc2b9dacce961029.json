Despite improvements in employment and income equality, Canadians are less happy.\n\nDeveloped countries are vulnerable to demographic headwinds as the number of retiring workers exceeds those entering the workforce.\n\nCanada rose one spot to No. 8 among developed nations on the 2019 Global Retirement Index, released today by Natixis Investment Managers. The annual index, a snapshot of the wellbeing and financial security of retirees in 44 countries, found Canada ranked higher in the finances and material wellbeing sub-indices, decreased in quality of life and held steady in health. The analysis by Natixis also identifies three global risks \u2013 low interest rates, longer lifespans and the high cost of climate change \u2013 that are weighing on retirees, policymakers and long-term global sustainability.\n\n\u201cMeeting the needs of today\u2019s retirees while preserving retirement security for future generations continues to be one of the most pressing challenges for economies around the globe,\u201d said Jean Raby, CEO at Natixis Investment Managers. \u201cWe created the Natixis Global Retirement Index to help facilitate a candid conversation about what steps need to be taken to ensure retirement security on a global scale.\u201d\n\nNow in its seventh year, the Natixis Global Retirement Index examines 18 factors which influence retiree welfare in the areas of finances in retirement, material wellbeing, health and quality of life. The Index calculates the relative performance for each of the 44 countries on each of these criteria, resulting in a composite score that provides a comparative tool for evaluating retirement security globally.\n\nHighlights of the 2019 Global Retirement Index include:\n\nWestern Europe continues to lead as a region, with 15 countries finishing in the top 25 for the third year in a row. The Nordic countries maintain their strong performance in the top 10, including Iceland (No. 1), Norway (No. 3), Sweden (No. 6) and Denmark (No. 7).\n\nIreland advanced to No. 4 from No. 14 two years ago due to an improved score in the Health sub-index, where it moves into the top 10 (from 19 th ), driven primarily by the country\u2019s higher per capita health spending. The country also performed well in Finances, powered by improvements in bank nonperforming loans and government indebtedness.\n\n), driven primarily by the country\u2019s higher per capita health spending. The country also performed well in Finances, powered by improvements in bank nonperforming loans and government indebtedness. Japan, which ranks No. 23, stands out for having the lowest score among GRI countries for old-age dependency, a measure of the number of active workers compared to the number of retirees. Japan has the highest life expectancy, but also one of the lowest fertility rates among developed countries. Despite having the highest score for employment in the Index, Japan has a small proportion of working-age individuals supporting those in retirement. This reflects a broader trend affecting many developed economies.\n\nFactors affecting the Canadian GRI ranking\n\nCanada saw its overall score improve on the back of better performances in both the Material Wellbeing (21st from 22nd) and Health (held steady at 8th) sub-indices compared to last year. The country scored lower in Quality of Life (13th from 9th) and Finances (7th from 8th). The following are notable factors affecting Canada\u2019s position:\n\nRobust finances, but growing pressure on government resources: Canada maintains its position in the top 10 in the finance category. The country marked gains in both the non-performing bank loans and governance indicators. However, its position is threatened by a growing ratio of retirees to active workers (old-age dependency), an ongoing trend that puts increasing pressure on government services over time. Lower scores for tax pressure and interest rates 1 also put its performance at risk.\n\nCanada maintains its position in the top 10 in the finance category.

Rising employment and economic opportunity: Higher scores for employment and improvements in income equality lift Canada\u2019s Material Wellbeing sub-index score.

Quality of life: Lower scores for environmental factors and the happiness indicator, which evaluates the quality of retirees\u2019 current lives, weighed on Canada\u2019s Quality of Life performance. However, a top 10 finish in the air quality indicator (2nd) is an encouraging sign.\n\nThree pressing risks for retirement security\n\nThe Natixis report, \u201cGlobal Security. Personal Risks,\u201d supplements the 2019 Index and illustrates three pressing risks and their implications for retirees and future generations globally. The analysis serves to encourage dialogue among policymakers, employers and individuals to understand the impact and help manage the risks to society.\n\nInterest rates: Interest rates do not appear to be rising anytime soon, and the related low yields on investments present hurdles for those looking to generate income in retirement. As a result, retirees may be forced to invest in higher-risk assets, thus exposing their portfolios to greater volatility at an age when they might not have time to recoup losses due to a market downturn. Demographics: Longevity represents a key risk for retirees. According to the United Nations, the impact of aging populations is greatest in developed countries. The most telling point of this trend came in 2018 when, for the first time in history, the number of people aged 65 and older outnumbered children under the age of five.2 It looks to only increase with time as, by 2050, old-age dependency in the developed world is expected to reach 46.40 and, by 2070, 49.54.3 This leaves policymakers with hard choices on how to address the funding crunch. Financial and health impacts of climate change: The risk of climate change is often viewed through a long-term lens, but it poses tangible health and financial risks to today\u2019s retirees. The costs associated with natural disasters help force up insurance rates and consume government resources. Munich Reinsurance Company reports that severe events helped make 2018 the fourth-costliest year for insured losses since 1980.4 Similarly, extreme heat has increased the risk of illness among older adults, particularly those with chronic illnesses, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.5\n\n\u201cRetirement security is a complex, multidimensional issue and there will be no single solution to the problem of ensuring that, after a life of work, individuals can live with dignity in retirement,\u201d said Dave Goodsell, Executive Director of the Natixis Center for Investor Insight. \u201cWith the 2019 Global Retirement Index, it is our goal to initiate a dialogue with policy makers, employers, individuals, and the financial industry about how to best address the needs of retirees for generations to come.\u201d\n\nTo download a copy of the Global Retirement Index, visit im.natixis.com/us/research/2019-global-retirement-index.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe Global Retirement Index assesses factors that drive retirement security across 44 countries where retirement is a pressing social and economic issue. It was compiled by Natixis Investment Managers with support from CoreData Research. The index includes International Monetary Fund (IMF) advanced economies, members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China). The researchers calculated a mean score in each category and combined the category scores for a final overall ranking of the 44 nations studied.\n\nAbout the Natixis Investment Institute\n\nThe Natixis Investment Institute applies Active Thinking\u00ae to critical issues shaping the investment landscape.
