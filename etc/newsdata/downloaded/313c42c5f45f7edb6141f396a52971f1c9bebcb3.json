The three chairs wrote that the shocking texts were \u201conly a subset of the full body of materials\u201d that had been obtained, the entirety of which they planned to release in the coming days.\n\n(Read the full document at the bottom of this article.)\n\nThe text message were largely sent by Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt Volker, who was until last month the State Department\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, to Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nIn one instance that appears to be an overt quid pro quo, Volker texted Yermak just hours before the two presidents were set to speak. In the message, Volker said the White House would work to \u201cnail down the date for [a] visit to Washington\u201d but only on the assumption that \u201cPresident Z convinces trump he will investigate/\u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky has become the flashpoint for a Democratic impeachment inquiry after a reconstruction of the call showed multiple instances of Trump pressuring his counterpart to investigate a prime political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter.\n\nHouse of Representatives\n\nIn the texts, Yermak later wrote that the call \u201cwent well\u201d and that Trump and Zelensky had agreed on a visit to the U.S. Later in August, however, Yermak pressed Volker to nail down the date, saying that once it was locked in, Ukrainian officials would outline their \u201cvision for the reboot of US-Ukraine relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, for five years, ending in early 2019.\n\nYermak also texted Volker at the end of August expressing concern about a report Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine. Trump canceled a planned visit to Poland to meet Zelensky a day later.\n\nThe text messages also show concern among some Trump administration officials. In multiple instances, Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, expressed worry that the White House was withholding military aid until any investigations into Biden were launched.\n\n\u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Taylor asked Sondland on Sept. 1. Sondland later replied \u201ccall me,\u201d and it\u2019s unclear what the pair discussed.\n\nHouse of Representatives\n\nBut the issue came up again a week later: \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor texted Sondland on Sept. 9, saying diplomacy had moved into his \u201cnightmare scenario.\u201d\n\nSondland later rejects that characterization, saying Trump had \u201cbeen crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d\n\nThe texts were attached to a letter condemning Trump\u2019s effort to minimize his call with Ukraine. It was signed by Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff (Calif.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee; Eliot Engel (N.Y.), chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; and Elijah Cummings (Md.), who chairs the House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nThe lawmakers expressed worry about the White House effort to delegitimize the impeachment inquiry, saying the Trump administration was \u201cengaging in a campaign of misinformation and misdirection in an attempt to normalize the act of soliciting foreign powers to interfere in our election.\u201d\n\nTrump has vehemently rejected claims that he did anything improper, referring to the inquiry as a \u201ccoup.\u201d On Thursday, the president publicly urged China to investigate the Bidens just moments after saying that \u201cif they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous power.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, the chairmen urged their colleagues to reject such claims, calling them \u201cunethical, unpatriotic and wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope every Member of the House will join us in condemning in the strongest terms the President\u2019s now open defiance of our core values as American citizens to guard against foreign interference in our democratic process,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThis article has been updated with details about the text messages.", "description": "Trump\u2019s call with the leader of Ukraine has prompted an impeachment inquiry as Democrats condemn what they call brazen efforts to extract political favors.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d96c2e42100003000a90c9e.jpeg?cache=igd1tr5nrs&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
