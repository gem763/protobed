Personally, I wouldn\u2019t be hugely thrilled at a man playing a recorder during a meditative moment, but it\u2019s the sort of unexpected vignette of humanity that sitting by the window affords. I don\u2019t understand having the option to sit at a window and not choosing it. Would you walk around with your eyes closed? Or sit in the dark? Do you watch television with it switched off?\n\nThe restaurant at the top of the North Tower of the World Trade Center was called Windows on the World. But all windows are windows on the world. Sometimes they\u2019re not great ones \u2013 as anyone privy to a neighbour\u2019s dressing routine can attest \u2013 but more often than not, sitting next to a window is the inspiration of painters and writers; a crash course in anthropology; a catalyst for a change in mood or reflection on, like, life.\n\nIt\u2019s a proscenium, where the arch is a peeling sash frame, or the scratched, plastic edges of an Airbus, or the little blue curtains of a first-class carriage. The things you see. The people, animals, happenings. With urban windows, the everyday cordiality: drivers and pedestrians thanking each other with nods and semaphore. Amazing outfits. Friends joshing each other. Or the opposite: annoying lads doing wheelies in the road, endangering themselves and everyone else, half a decade before they\u2019ll shake their heads about it all.\n\nTrain window seats reveal green and gold treasures for miles. Thoughts appear from fields and tumble from skies. That doesn\u2019t happen when you\u2019re looking at an open-and-closing malfunctioning toilet door, or are buffeted by trolleys selling Mini Cheddars for \u00a35. In a plane, sure, you have to disturb your seat neighbours once in a while \u2013 for a wee, to stave off DVT \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it, for the pointillist pastel houses of foreign lands; the expanse of seas and undulating rivers never swum.\n\nThe thud, thud, thud of techno music leaves no space for bad thoughts Read more\n\nThe significances of window seats are well recognised. That\u2019s why film cuts include characters staring mournfully past droplets of rain on glass, or CEOs looking out from top-floor offices, their feet on desks. It is why we\u2019re all well versed in the Parisian flaneur, strolling the streets before sitting and observing. It\u2019s why you can easily imagine me writing this, right now, watching the shadows on the pavement, the sun warming the glass, my chin in my hand, head turning slowly back to the screen.", "description": "Whether you\u2019re staring mournfully past rain on glass or looking out from a top floor office, feet on desk, nothing can beat a seat with a view", "authors": ["Hannah Jane Parkinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fb1ab06b023fee18a1cc427c1f781b0526c7eb2/0_310_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2bcee6bf680ec6b10d89b243e4cf7d31", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
