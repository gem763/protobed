After a weekend of unrelenting schedules and all-night after-parties, the caffeine intake is dangerously high and Anna Wintour is no longer the only person wearing sunglasses indoors.\n\nBut in spite of waning spirits, the Monday of LFW is always packed with sartorial highs. The schedule features some of British fashion\u2019s biggest hitters, including Burberry, JW Anderson and Christopher Kane.\n\nFirst up was Roksanda, whose smattering of scarlets, tangerines and fuchsias salvaged what was otherwise a desperately dreary wet morning. The Serbian designer also won non-fashion brownie points for giving front row seats to her eight-year-old daughter and the rest of her Year Four class \u2013 their gingham uniforms were bang on trend. Soon it was time for the fashion pack to migrate en masse to Erdem, where the Victorian era was reimagined in technicolour. Richard Malone provided a much-needed dose of diversity in the afternoon by casting models of all ages in his show. It was a shame that so few followed suit, choosing instead to fetishise youth and waif-like frames: one of the industry\u2019s most vexing issues.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut back to the clothes, which were thankfully a lot less tired than those watching them. The season\u2019s buzzword, Big Dress Energy (BDE) came into its own at Richard Quinn with tutus large enough to knock somebody over and sparkles bright enough to have them seeing spots. For the uninitiated, BDE is a trend that owes itself to British designer Molly Goddard\u2019s signature frothy tulle, which was made famous by Killing Eve\u2019s Villanelle. Read on for our highlights of day four of LFW, and see for yourself why BDE shows no signs of shrinking.\n\nRoksanda\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The sky above Serpentine Galleries was overcast, and the sounds of Joni Mitchell\u2019s Both Sides Now set an anguished tone that seemed fitting for the drizzly Monday morning.\n\nThe first looks \u2013 slouchy suiting, boiler suits and draped gowns \u2013 came in rain cloud-coloured hues, with nothing but the odd flash of beige to spice up the palette.\n\nBut, in the words of Death Cab for Cutie, \u201cIf you feel discouraged that there\u2019s a lack of colour here, please don\u2019t worry lover, it\u2019s really bursting at the seams\u201d. Indeed, within minutes, humdrum neutrals became spangled brights. A crimson cape here, some bubblegum taffeta there\u2026 suddenly new hues were emerging with supersonic speed.\n\nAnd just as the colours blossomed, so did the silhouettes. Bulbous skirts and gargantuan sleeves brought the show to its joyous conclusion, and guests including Sinead Burke and Lauren Santo Domingo were all the more grateful having spent the first few minutes gearing up for 50 shades of grey.\n\nErdem\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

So late, in fact, that by the time Billy Porter came gliding down the runway to take his seat, some mistook his red beret and jacquard coat for the Canadian designer\u2019s opening look. But Moral\u0131oglu\u2019s vision for spring/summer 2020 was quite different.\n\nSounds of birds chirping transported guests away from the intimate garden setting and into another world, one that notes on each of the seats explained was inspired by the late Italian actor-turned-political agent, Tina Modotti. Her sartorial story began, according to Erdem, with rich Victorian gowns that came with high necklines, extravagant brocades and wallpaper florals.\n\nWide-brimmed boater hats and elbow-grazing gloves gave splattered patterns a retro socialite spin \u2013 think Edith Wharton in a child\u2019s art class.\n\nThe yolky yellows and pomegranate fuchsias might be a bit much for those who favour Erdem\u2019s more timeless pieces (would the Duchess of Cambridge wear turquoise ruffles?), but this collection is not for them. It\u2019s for Modotti, and she had a flair for the dramatic. Or, as the show notes put it: \u201cShe dressed to become who she felt she was meant to be\u201d.\n\nRichard Malone\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Thanks to some nifty wire work, Malone crafted dresses so wide, they almost grazed the noses of those on the FROW.\n\nThe thought of anyone wearing such an ensemble might be unfathomable \u2013 there are only so many wide doorways in London \u2013 but Malone\u2019s vision is clearly coloured by the spectacle as opposed to the practical.\n\nRichard Quinn\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Things were running late, and after 35 minutes of huffing and puffing outside an East London lido (an unusual choice for a venue), it looked like some people had thrown in their fashion towels and left.\n\nIt\u2019s a decision they may regret for the rest of their lives, or at least for a few hours. Quinn knows how to put on a show.\n\nWhen the iron clad gates were finally opened, the crowd was greeted by what must\u2019ve been a 30-person choir and a full orchestra, both of which probably require some setup time. People softened and complaints soon turned to oohing and ahhing.\n\nBilly Porter headed straight to the FROW dressed like the Wizard of Oz, while American Vogue\u2019s Hamish Bowles slowly took his seat beside him, looking no less flamboyant with ice blonde hair and a plaid suit. The setting was opulent and full of personality, just like the clothes.\n\nGowns came in explosions of oversized florals and were accompanied by matching tights. Some were layered with latex polo tops, while others bore dramatic marabou trims. Ginormous ribbons were stuck onto bodices and emphasised by even larger ruffled sleeves and tulle skirts, some of which looked so flammable I caught myself checking there were no naked flames nearby.\n\nSeasoned runway aficionado Erin O\u2019Connor made two surprise appearances, first in a billowing black and red floral gown and then again in a modest fuchsia ensemble.\n\nBut it was the show\u2019s grand finale that had some shed a tear, and others chime in excitable squeals.\n\nAfter what most other designers would stage for a finale \u2013 models walking in unison to display the final looks \u2013 Quinn shocked us all by sending a group of children onto the runway dressed as angels in floral skirts and feathery white hooded jackets. They were soon joined by Quinn\u2019s cohort of grown-up models, some standing scattered on the runway, others still in a tableau that was unveiled with a pop of confetti.\n\nThe choir sang God Save The Queen as a nod to HRH herself, who famously sat in Quinn\u2019s front row last year. Then finally, Quinn himself emerged to rapturous applause, bearing the grin of a man who knows he is worth waiting for.", "description": "Come day four of London Fashion Week, the reigning off-catwalk trend is exhaustion.
