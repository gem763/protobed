USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Here are three things we learned from the Coliseum after the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 20-7 loss to San Francisco on Sunday.\n\n1. After winning the NFC West by two and three games, respectively, the past two seasons, the Rams find themselves in a new position under third-year head coach Sean McVay.\n\nLooking up in the divisional standings.\n\nOn their first three-game losing streak under McVay, the Rams (3-3) are now three games in the loss column behind first-place San Francisco (5-0).\n\nThey\u2019ve also lost head to head to both teams they\u2019re now chasing, the 49ers and second-place Seattle (4-1), making the hill to climb that much steeper.\n\n2.

Just two weeks after throwing for a career-high 517 yards in the home loss to Tampa Bay, Los Angeles quarterback Jared Goff set a career low with just 78 yards passing against San Francisco.\n\nThat was due to Los Angeles' on-going struggles up front.\n\nGoff was sacked four times by the San Francisco defensive front, as the Rams offensive line continued to struggle in protection with first-year starters Brian Allen and Joe Noteboom at center and left guard, respectively.\n\nTo make matters worse, Noteboom was helped off the field with a leg injury and carted to the locker room. He was replaced by fellow second-year interior lineman Jamil Demby.\n\nGoff's previous career low was 90, also in a home loss to San Francisco, in the penultimate start of his ugly rookie year on Dec. 24, 2016.\n\nJoe Curley is a staff writer with the Ventura County Star.
