Men also see a decline in sperm quality as they age, contributing to infertility issues in nearly half of couples, he said.\n\nWhile some millennial men Dellatto spoke to are freezing their sperm before getting a vasectomy so they can stress less during sex, others said they're doing it because they want to have kids \u2014 just not right now.\n\nMed school student Felipe Bolivar, 28, told Dellatto he and his girlfriend chose sperm freezing over egg freezing because it was cheaper and an easier procedure.\n\nAccording to Health.com, the cost of sperm freezing can range from $250 to $1,300.\n\nRead more: The US birthrate is the lowest it's been in 32 years, and it's partly because millennials can't afford having kids\n\nMillennials are delaying marriage and children\n\nSperm freezing is symptomatic of the fact that American millennials are getting married and having kids later in life, taking more time to find the right partner and prioritizing financial success.\n\nThe median age of first marriage in the US is 27 for women and 29 for men, Business Insider's Mark Abadi reported, citing the US Census Bureau. In 1980, for comparison, the median age was 22 for women and 25 for men.\n\nAnd those who have found the right partner are waiting longer in their relationships to get married \u2014 4.9 years on average, INSIDER's Kristin Salaky reported, citing a 2017 study from Bridebook.\n\nConsequently, the US birthrate is at its lowest in 32 years, Bill Chappell for NPR reported, citing a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More 30-something women are having babies than women in their 20s for the first time ever \u2014 a difference that grew in 2018, according to the CDC report.\n\nAs millennials delay childbearing, methods to help the process are becoming more popular. Egg freezing has boomed in recent years to the point where tech companies like Apple, Facebook, and Google offer it as a benefit for female employees, Chris Weller previously reported for Business Insider.\n\nAnd egg freezing services are popping up to accommodate the rising interest, like the new fertility studio Trellis in New York City, which Business Insider's Katie Warren toured in November 2018.\n\nSo, while millennials are putting off having kids for a variety of reasons, one thing is clear: Sperm freezing is the latest in their series of efforts to delay time.", "description": "While some men are freezing sperm before a vasectomy, others are doing it for health and infertility reasons \u2014 sperm quality ages over time.", "authors": ["Hillary Hoffower"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9395362e22af3f020abf15?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
