While this idea might seem like wishful thinking, it could soon become a reality. At least that's what battery specialists Echion Technologies hope.\n\nThe team, which originally formed at Cambridge University, is now hoping to improve ordinary lithium-ion batteries by adding a new chemical mixture that will allow charging times for both electric cars and mobile phones to drop to just six minutes.\n\nRead more: 12 of the most powerful fully electric cars money can buy, including the car James Bond may drive in the next '007' film\n\nFounders Jean de la Verpillliere and Alex Groombridge have not said exactly what is in the new material (that could possibly be a compound), but have revealed to the Cambridge Independent that the material is simply \"dropped into\" the existing battery infrastructure and that it doesn't contain expensive and highly flammable graphite.\n\nTheoretically, fast-charging a conventional battery is possible. However, the composition of the powders used can cause damage when the charge is too high or too fast. In extreme cases, short circuits can occur and cause dangerous explosions.\n\nThe new mixture for these particular batteries will no longer have this problem.\n\nRead more: European power firms aim to harness electric car batteries\n\nSo far, the young developers have been able to produce 2.2 lbs of powder a day, which is just enough for one electric car battery\u2013 although this might change very soon.\n\n\"We're working on methods to make powders which are scalable and where 1,000 tonnes could be made quite easily in factories,\" de la Verpilliere told the Cambridge Independent. \"We have a prototype now and are moving towards commercialization early next year. The tests have to be validated beforehand.\"", "description": "A team from Cambridge University is working on improving ordinary lithium-ion batteries by adding a new chemical mixture.", "authors": ["Marie-Sophie R\u00f6der", "Sophia Ankel", "Business Insider Deutschland"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d6e49bc2e22af207b37b0a5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
