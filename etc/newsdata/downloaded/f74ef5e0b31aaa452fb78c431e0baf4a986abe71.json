They will be leased to Wagyu beef producer Stone Axe Pastoral Company as part of a strategy to increase its weighting to natural resource-based assets over infrastructure assets.", "description": "The agribusiness trust will forego $11 million in annual poultry farm rental revenue, but grow its exposure to the beef cattle sector.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d557089c2dc15b293b1b16f8b212ece2bcdb0afd", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
