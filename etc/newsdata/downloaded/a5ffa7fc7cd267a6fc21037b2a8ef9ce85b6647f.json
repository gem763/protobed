If parliament decides to vote on it and it is rejected, the government could collapse.\n\nAnalysts, however, do not expect any major obstacles for the Socialist government to be allowed to rule.\n\nNext year's budget is likely to prove its first big test, with the far-left demanding more public spending, while Costa insists on sticking to strict expenditure controls to achieve a budget surplus next year.", "description": "Antonio Costa asked form a new government after his centre-left Socialists came first in Sunday's election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/893710a434314735b779b74f644c873e_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
