The golden Labrador retriever barks, wags, and responds to touch, providing emotional support to seniors, people with dementia, and anyone who can\u2019t have a live pet. It\u2019s funding now on Kickstarter and has already reached its $20,000 goal.\n\nRelated Failed crowdfunded gadgets are forcing Kickstarter and Indiegogo to change\n\nTombot\u2019s creators wanted the robot to look and behave as close to a real dog as possible, so they enlisted the help of Jim Henson\u2019s Creature Shop for the design. As a result, Tombot moves a lot like an animatronic puppet, (it sort of reminds me of Falkor from The Neverending Story, which I\u2019m not sure is good or bad) and its lifelike expressions are a little bit unnerving. My immediate response to Tombot was, \u201cThere\u2019s pain behind this dog\u2019s eyes.\u201d It looks too sad! That\u2019s the risk you take when you try to make something look realistic \u2014 for comparison, the Qoobo therapy cat pillow sidesteps this issue by foregoing a head entirely.\n\nBut ultimately, it doesn\u2019t matter what I think, it\u2019s not for me; it\u2019s a therapy robot for seniors and patients with dementia. There have been studies around the benefits of robotic pets like Paro the seal, which have been shown to reduce stress and anxiety among dementia patients. It\u2019s also entirely possible for humans to form emotional bonds with robots \u2014 just look at Sony\u2019s Aibo dogs, which are given Buddhist funerals in Japan when it\u2019s time to say goodbye; or the Lovot companion robot I declared as my son after playing with it for 30 minutes at CES. That said, Tombot\u2019s potential benefits haven\u2019t been proven in any studies yet.\n\nTombot is a lot more affordable than the $2,899 Aibo and the $3,000 Lovot, too. Early backers can get Tombot for $299, but it\u2019ll retail for $500 when it launches, with a target date of August 2020. Although as with all Kickstarters, keep in mind that production issues could keep the project from delivering on time, and use your best judgment before backing.", "description": "The Tombot puppy is a robotic companion animal designed by Jim Henson\u2019s Creature Shop to provide therapy benefits for seniors and patients with dementia.
