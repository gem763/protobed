The tax would help fund new government programs aimed at reducing income inequality and improving healthcare and education.\n\nJones also said a Bernie Sanders presidency would send the markets plunging 20%, while the election of a more centrist candidate such as Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, or Amy Klobuchar would spark a 10% drop, according to Bloomberg.\n\nFurther, the founder of the Tudor Investment Corporation also said the re-election of President Trump would raise the S&P 500 to 3,600. That figure represents more than an 18% jump from the index's level of roughly 3,046 on Tuesday morning.\n\nWall Street has been growing increasingly concerned that a Warren presidency could hit stocks in sectors such as energy and insurance because of the candidates policy proposals.\n\nWarren has also proposed new regulations that would make private equity firms liable for debts and pension promises from the companies they own.\n\nRead more: An investor who turned $15 million of firmwide assets into $200 million explains his 3-part process for picking stocks \u2014 and breaks down a 'once in a lifetime' opportunity he sees in uranium", "description": "Hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones warned that the stock market could crash 25% if Elizabeth Warren wins the upcoming presidential election, accordin...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5db8487cdee019484f54ff22-2000/paul-tudor-jones.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
