No stirrer. No glass. We're redefining how whisky can be enjoyed. Introducing The Glenlivet Capsule Collection #noglassrequired pic.twitter.com/F4MGErsfZM \u2014 The Glenlivet (@TheGlenlivet) October 2, 2019\n\nAccording to the video, Glenlivet partnered with sustainable packaging startup Notpla to create the pods and London bar Tayer to create three new Founder's Reserve-based recipes.\n\n\"To enjoy them, pop the capsule in your mouth and take a bite to release the delicious cocktail ingredients,\" the narrator says in the video.\n\nEach capsule contains 23 milliliters of booze, or about 0.77 ounces. A typical shot glass holds 1.5 ounces.\n\n\"As a brand that celebrates originality, we are always looking to break the conventions that have determined how single malt Scotch has historically been enjoyed,\" Glenlivet director Miriam Eceolaza told Food and Wine magazine. \"The Glenlivet Capsule Collection does exactly that, and we're excited to see how people react when they try our glassless cocktails.\"\n\nPeople on the internet have a lot of questions\n\nMany people on Twitter wondered if the capsule collection was a joke or a parody.\n\nGlenlivet did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on whether or not the cocktail capsules are a real product the company will be rolling out.\n\nSome said the capsules reminded them of Tide Pods, the laundry detergent capsules that have long been at the center of a meme about the product appearing edible. In the \"Tide Pod Challenge,\" some people - mainly teens - pretended, or in some cases, appeared to actually eat Tide Pods.\n\nAn overarching criticism of the whiskey pods was that the capsules would \"cheapen\" the mystique of the Glenlivet brand and ruin the experience of drinking whiskey.\n\n\"Scotch is meant to be sipped, its complex flavors enjoyed in micro sips,\" one Twitter user wrote. \"As soon as you treat it like tequila or cheap hooch, your brand is dead.\"\n\nAnother user wrote: \"This destroys the experience of tasting a good scotch. You can't nose it. You can't sip it. You can't fold your tongue, and then flatten your tongue inside your mouth, exposing different flavor receptors.\"\n\nOn Instagram, one person pointed out that most whiskey drinkers seem to particularly enjoy the experience of sipping the beverage.\n\n\"I don't imagine they get a thrill out of popping a pod in their mouths,\" they wrote.\n\nNotpla, the packaging startup that created the capsules, told Business Insider that the capsules are a limited release product that will only be available at the Tayer bar in London during London Cocktail Week, which runs from October 4 through October 13.\n\nThe creator of the capsule cocktail recipes, bartender Alex Kratena of Tayer, told The Washington Post that the collaboration was \"an exploration of the flavor pillars\" in Glenlivet whiskey.\n\n\"For me, there's so much more which makes the liquid complex,\" Kratena told the Post. \"When you insert them in your mouth and gently press them against your palate, you get all the flavors.\"\n\nHe added that any similarity to Tide Pods was a coincidence.\n\nGlenlivet also did not reply to Business Insider's request for comment on the price of the \"capsule cocktails.\"\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Some people on social media have compared the whiskey capsules to Tide Pods, while others say they will ruin the experience of drinking whiskey.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9444/46368bd4f62e4eb6bed2fd632ba82ac8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
