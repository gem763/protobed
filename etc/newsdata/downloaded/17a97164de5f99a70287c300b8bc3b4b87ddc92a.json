The announcement reads:\n\n\u201cThe draft legislation prohibits large platform utilities, like Facebook, from becoming chartered, licensed or registered as a U.S. financial institution (e.g. like taxpayer-backed banks, investment funds, and stock exchanges) or otherwise becoming affiliated with such financial institutions.\u201d\n\nPreviously, Calibra CEO David Marcus testified on the potential advantages of Libra at the hearings before the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee in July 2019. In late September, Marcus published a statement criticizing the shortcomings of the existing payment systems such as SWIFT and RT1.\n\nOn Sept. 26, Facebook CEO Zuckerberg claimed that the firm is taking a much more careful approach to Libra than its previous projects. In leaked audio from Q&A sessions between Facebook employees and Zuckerberg, the CEO underlined the consultative approach for Libra, noting that private engagement with regulators will be more substantive and less dramatic than public procedures such as Congressional hearings.", "description": "Facebook CEO Marck Zuckerberg will testify before the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Oct. 23 regarding Libra", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNjlhZDY2MjZmOWEyYjZiMTM5NTMxMTA4NGM2OWZmYWMuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
