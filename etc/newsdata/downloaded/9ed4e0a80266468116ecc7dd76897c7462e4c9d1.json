That is causing Ernst & Young to rethink its strategy.\n\nThe Big Four accounting firm, which is about halfway through a two-year plan to invest $1 billion in technology across its four main businesses, is planning to unveil a new strategy focused on heightened technological investment, said Carmine Di Sibio, EY\u2019s global chairman and chief executive.\n\n\u201cA lot of the raw work in corporate tax work is around data and technology, so that warrants an investment in that type of technology,\u201d Mr. Di Sibio said in an interview. \u201cCorporates are saying, \u2018That\u2019s not really what I do. It is what the Big Four firms do, so let them invest in the technology, and then it\u2019ll be more efficient for us.\u2019 So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing.\u201d\n\nCompanies such as General Electric Co. and electronics company Nokia Corp. are moving in-house tax staff to an outside accounting firm.\n\nMr. Di Sibio, who took the helm of EY in July, declined to disclose more about the technology strategy. The firm plans a formal announcement in the coming months, he said.\n\nEY already has developed a blockchain platform for authenticating corporate clients\u2019 products, such as wine labels and frozen foods, in an effort to help reduce fraud. The firm also employs artificial intelligence to help clients analyze documents to reduce processing time and increase accuracy.\n\nThe firm on Wednesday reported its ninth-straight increase in global revenue, a boost that will give it more firepower to invest in these kinds of technologies.\n\nEY recorded global revenue of $36.4 billion for fiscal 2019, up 4.7% from the previous fiscal year, the firm said. Revenue in the year ended June 30 rose 8% when measured in local-currency terms, the way major accounting firms prefer to measure growth.\n\nThe firm\u2019s growth occurred at a slower pace than in the past couple of years. Last year, revenue at EY rose 10.7% in U.S. dollar terms and 7.4% in local-currency terms.\n\nThe Big Four\u2014which also include PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and KPMG\u2014are international networks of private partnerships. They disclose revenue but not profit. Because companies rely heavily on them for audit and consulting services, finance chiefs tend to pay close attention to their financial health.\n\nThe firms, which collectively reached their strongest growth in at least a decade in fiscal 2018, have built out their consulting businesses for years, attaining growth they couldn\u2019t find in their core auditing businesses.\n\nRevenue growth at EY, which is the first of the Big Four accounting firms to release full-year numbers for 2019, has generally been in line with the other Big Four firms over time, said Michael Shaub, a Texas A&M University accounting professor. But EY lags behind PwC and Deloitte in terms of total revenue.\n\nPwC reported $41.28 billion in total revenue in 2018. Deloitte reported $43.2 billion in total revenue last year. \u201cEY is trying to make up some ground,\u201d Mr. Shaub said, adding that EY\u2019s fiscal 2019 revenue growth \u201cis not going to close that gap.\u201d\n\nKPMG, the smallest of the Big Four in terms of revenue, reported $28.96 billion in 2018.\n\nEach of the Big Four firms has cited a long-term investment in new technologies as a key factor in driving revenue growth. The firms have also sought to strike a delicate balance of managing audit and advisory businesses under one roof\u2014a practice that has spurred scrutiny from regulators who want to guard against potential conflicts of interest.\n\nEY\u2019s revenue from auditing historically exceeds that of consulting, in contrast with some of its competitors such as Deloitte. But its advisory revenue growth has been stronger than in its other businesses, averaging 12.9% from over an eight-year period ending 2018.\n\nHowever, EY\u2019s revenue from advisory services saw its smallest growth increase in nine years, at 6.4%, reflecting fewer regulatory-driven projects for banking clients in the latest fiscal year, the company said. Consulting comprises about one-fourth of EY\u2019s total revenue.\n\nA continuation in reduced advisory growth could signal that there are fewer hiring opportunities for accounting students seeking consulting jobs, Mr. Shaub said.\n\nEY\u2019s transaction advisory segment saw the largest growth, at 11.9%, the firm said.\n\nWrite to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com", "description": "As technology is increasingly integrated into corporate accounting processes, companies\u2019 expectations of accounting firms have changed.
