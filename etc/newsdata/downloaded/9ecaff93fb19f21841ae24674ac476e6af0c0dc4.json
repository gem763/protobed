Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBefore the team\u2019s first practice of the week at the University of Washington, Payton said the team is considering its QB options before taking on the 2-0 Seahawks. Veteran starter Drew Brees is out at least six weeks with a torn ligament in his right thumb.\n\nBridgewater entered last week\u2019s loss at Los Angeles and played the second half as the Rams pulled away. Asked whether third quarterback and do-it-all offensive dynamo Taysom Hill would be limited in his other roles since he\u2019ll be elevated behind Bridgewater, Payton scoffed: \u201cYou\u2019re assuming he\u2019s the No. 2.\u201d\n\n\u2014Staying the course despite scoring 10 points in eight quarters, the Miami Dolphins maintain support of Ryan Fitzpatrick as the starting quarterback.\n\nCoach Brian Flores opened the door on Monday to a potential change to Josh Rosen but announced that he\u2019ll ride with Fitzpatrick into Dallas for Week 3.\n\n\u2014Eli Manning displayed no bitterness during his first public comments after being demoted as starting quarterback of the New York Giants.\n\nIn fact, the 38-year-old Manning vowed to be a good teammate and help first-round pick Daniel Jones, who is replacing him as the team\u2019s signal caller beginning with Sunday\u2019s road game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n\u2014The Carolina Panthers practiced a second straight day without Cam Newton taking any snaps, but coach Ron Rivera said he isn\u2019t ready to declare his starting quarterback out for Sunday\u2019s road game against the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nIf Newton, who was in a walking boot on Tuesday after aggravating a left foot injury, is unable to play, Kyle Allen will start, Rivera has said.\n\n\u2014Quarterback Sam Darnold projected his return from mononucleosis for Week 5, and New York Jets coach Adam Gase called the target realistic.\n\nThe Jets originally estimated an absence of three to seven weeks. Mono in adults can be more serious because of the potential impact on internal organs.\n\n\u2014With early season injuries piling up, the Philadelphia Eagles opted to cancel practice and instead held a walkthrough.\n\nAmong the ailing Eagles are receivers DeSean Jackson (abdominal strain) and Alshon Jeffery (calf), tight ends Dallas Goedert (calf) and Zach Ertz (ribs), running back Corey Clement (shoulder) and defensive tackles Malik Jackson (foot) and Tim Jernigan (foot).\n\n\u2014The Cowboys granted the wish of disgruntled defensive end Taco Charlton, waiving the former first-round pick.\n\nHis release clears room for defensive end Robert Quinn to be activated following a two-game suspension for violating the league\u2019s policy on performance-enhancing drugs.\n\n\u2014If there were any doubt about Jalen Ramsey\u2019s status for Jacksonville\u2019s game against the Tennessee Titans on Thursday night, Jaguars coach Doug Marrone cleared it up: The disgruntled cornerback will play.\n\nMarrone was involved in a shouting match with Ramsey on Sunday during the Jaguars\u2019 13-12 loss at Houston. Ramsey has asked to be traded.\n\n\u2014Kansas City Chiefs starting left tackle Eric Fisher is scheduled for surgery Thursday to repair a core muscle injury.\n\nFisher sustained the injury Friday in practice, was listed as questionable for Sunday\u2019s game against the Oakland Raiders and played only the first series before leaving the game. Cam Erving came in as his replacement.\n\n\u2014New England Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown won\u2019t be prosecuted following sexual assault accusations because of the statute of limitations, according to Pittsburgh-area law enforcement.\n\nBritney Taylor is bringing a civil lawsuit against Brown for an alleged incident in June 2017. Brown has denied the accusations.\n\n\u2014The Washington Redskins signed free agent outside linebacker Noah Spence and placed cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie on injured reserve.\n\nRodgers-Cromartie, who has seven tackles and no interceptions in two games this season, sustained a leg injury on Sunday during the Redskins\u2019 loss to the Cowboys.\n\n\u2014Cleveland Browns tight end David Njoku sustained a broken wrist in Monday night\u2019s game against the Jets, according to multiple media reports. He is expected to be out for more than a month, though he is seeking additional medical opinions.\n\n\u2014Jets veteran defensive backs Trumaine Johnson and Jamal Adams added to the team\u2019s miserable start of the season by complaining about being benched.\n\n\u2014New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was limited at practice due to a calf issue, according to the team\u2019s injury report. The nature of the injury or when Brady sustained it was unclear.\n\n\u2014The Indianapolis Colts waived quarterback Chad Kelly, who just completed a two-game suspension for violating the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy. Kelly could be signed to the team\u2019s practice squad once he clears waivers on Thursday.\n\n\u2014The Oakland Raiders acquired wide receiver/returner Trevor Davis from the Green Bay Packers, according to multiple reports. The compensation for Davis was not immediately known.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Saints coach Sean Payton is not tipping his hand at quarterback, refusing to name backup Teddy Bridgewater as the starter Sunday when New Orleans visits the Seattle Seahawks.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431437622&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I03P-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
