We know the awful grind of making the right points, marshaling the right evidence, arguing with good faith, and making absolutely no progress at changing someone\u2019s mind.\n\nNowhere is it more common than in political conversations (which may be too polite a word for what most of us find ourselves in): The entire country feels like it\u2019s stuck in one big wheel-spinning persuasive failure, where the same facts seem to give different verdicts or even agreeing on the facts seems impossible.\n\nSo what can we do about the political stalemates we find ourselves in, other than keep sinking hours into the same conversations over the same dinner tables that accomplish nothing except making us want to beat our interlocutors and sometimes ourselves with the salt shaker?\n\nI\u2019ve spent two years interviewing people who changed their minds about the beliefs that were most important to them. I spoke to people who left cults, people who found out their families were criminals, people who discovered their identity wasn\u2019t what they thought it was, people who had to rethink the accuracy of their own memories. They all taught me about how hard it is for minds to really change \u2014 and how strange it is talk about changing \u201cminds\u201d as though minds weren\u2019t attached to people. When we try to change a belief, we are often trying to change a person.\n\nHere is the bad news: I cannot, with any confidence, give you a fail-safe guide to changing a person\u2019s mind. I can say with confidence that anyone who sells you a persuasive strategy that claims to know how to change a person\u2019s mind without intricate knowledge of their circumstances or the genealogy of their beliefs is either lying or grievously mistaken. But I can give us one strategy that I think we overlook too often in our political debates, from the dinner-table kind all the way up to the televised kind with the suits and the hairspray-lacquered journalists.\n\nThe strategy is this: Ask where people\u2019s beliefs come from as well as what they actually believe.\n\nAll too often we pay attention to the outputs of people\u2019s belief systems and not the systems themselves. We preoccupy ourselves with what they believe at the expense of why they believe it. But often the beliefs themselves are just the visible surface of a complex personal system, and trying to remove the belief itself without looking at its causal history is like cutting off the visible leaves of a weed and never wondering about its roots.\n\nThis is true for all sorts of beliefs, but it\u2019s especially for political ones: we so often busy ourselves with slinging facts and evidence at each other that we forget to ask where our opponents\u2019 belief came from. And if their belief didn\u2019t spring from evidence, then evidence might not be the best tool to remove it.\n\nLet me give you an example. Dylan used to be a member of a strict apocalypse-heralding sect. In a lot of ways its structure mirrored that of a particularly tight political group: it was suspicious of outsiders, cultivated a mistrust of people who suggested that they might be wrong, punished people with social exclusion for associating with nonbelievers and was organized around the charismatic authority of leader-figures. It sounds worryingly familiar to anyone whose family members have found a political identity and clung to it like it\u2019s driftwood and they\u2019re drowning.\n\nDylan changed his mind \u2014 in his 20s, after having been raised in the group. An impressive change. But he didn\u2019t change his mind because of any evidence against one of his beliefs. It wasn\u2019t about what he believed. It was about how he\u2019d come to believe it.\n\nHe fell in love with a woman named Missy, a nonbeliever (though she didn\u2019t tell him that at the time \u2014 in fact she spent five years pretending to believe what he did). His elders never liked Missy, and he couldn\u2019t fathom why. When the elders told him to choose between his wife and salvation, he realized, he trusted his wife more than them. And since his beliefs about the apocalypse had only arrived because he trusted them, changing his mind about his elders\u2019 character meant changing his mind about every other one of his beliefs.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been possible if Dylan had simply had debates about the evidence for and against his beliefs. In fact he did; Missy argued with him all the time. Until he had to look at the causal chain behind his beliefs, the beliefs themselves stayed strong.\n\nOur political debates and the ways they fail have a lot in common with Dylan\u2019s story. Many of our political views didn\u2019t arise out of evidence, and yet we persist in thinking evidence is the best way to displace them. This is how it\u2019s possible to sink vast amounts of energy and money into \u201cdebating the facts\u201d \u2014 between candidates on TV in front of red white and blue banners, or in the wormholes of an online comment section \u2014 and still see astonishingly low rates of mind-changing.\n\nDebates like these start to feel like recreational combat. They draw viewers, and they feel like entertainment, but they don\u2019t bring us to better beliefs. In fact psychological experiments suggest that hearing evidence against what we believe just makes us believe it more.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an argument against speaking to each other. It is an argument against speaking to each other in the ways we always have, with the same presumptions about which debates work and why. Our usual \u201cclash of ideas\u201d models deal with the results of our belief systems, not the systems themselves. If we want to make political progress we don\u2019t need more debate \u2014 we have plenty. We need to look at the roots of people\u2019s beliefs.\n\nEleanor Gordon-Smith is a philosopher and radio producer.
