Mr. Besanko, who had joined Kohl\u2019s in 2017 from retail and wholesale food seller Supervalu Inc., will remain with the company in an advisory role until his departure at the end of the fiscal year.\n\nThe move comes after the department-store operator reported its third consecutive decline in quarterly sales and announced that the company\u2019s president, Sona Chawla, would step down in mid-October. The company is searching for a new chief operating officer to succeed her.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nMichelle Gass, the chief executive of Kohl\u2019s, \u201chas to deal with two major exits while she is under pressure to show that her strategy is working,\u201d said David Swartz, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. \u201cThe results from the year\u2019s first half didn\u2019t give a lot of confidence.\u201d\n\nKohl\u2019s didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nKohl\u2019s total sales fell 3.1% to $4.4 billion for the latest quarter ended Aug. 3. Other department stores such as Macy\u2019s Inc. also reported lower-than-expected results for the summer quarter.\n\nThe sales slump in the first half of the year puts more pressure on sales performance during the coming holiday season. To propel customer traffic, Kohl\u2019s has been launching initiatives such as an Amazon returns partnership, which allows shoppers to return items they bought on Amazon.com to any of its more than 1,100 stores, with no box required.\n\nThose initiatives, though, could increase expenses, analysts said.\n\n\u201cAs the online business gets bigger, that could lead to more fulfillment and technology costs, which they didn\u2019t have to deal with as much in the past,\u201d Mr. Swartz said.\n\nMs. Timm joined the company in 1999 and held progressive leadership positions across several areas of finance. In recent years, she led a major cost reduction program and has been focused on streamlining operations, which will likely continue to be integral to her role, according to Chuck Grom, a senior retail analyst at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors.\n\n\u201cThe new CFO could manage expenses by building upon many of things Kohl\u2019s has done already, like using big data to drive inventory management and working to take the supply chain to the next level,\u201d said Christina Boni, senior credit officer at Moody\u2019s Investors Service Inc.\n\n\u2014Stephen Nakrosis contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com", "description": "Kohl\u2019s promoted a finance veteran to the role of finance chief as the company looks to cut costs and boost customer traffic after a stretch of sluggish sales, analysts say.", "authors": ["Mark Maurer"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-116249/social", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
