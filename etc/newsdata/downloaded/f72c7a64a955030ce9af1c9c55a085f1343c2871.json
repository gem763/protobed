After its use, it adds to the existing pile of the plastic in the cities. No one knows when and how it can be cleared. Some say never. Hence, pollution will have no end. In Israel, there is an expanding community that's trying to live without generating waste, or almost without it.\n\nJerusalem's Or family is one of them. They live a minimalist life believing that there's no need to keep needless items at home. Their living room doesn't have a furniture and their kitchen doesn't have containers and jars.They try to buy their food at take it home in reusable canvas bags.\n\nEmil Salman\n\nTheir fruit and vegetables are delivered from an organic farm.

There\u2019s someone just like you. Do you know her?\u2019\u201d Shalom told Ha'aretz.\n\nTheir wedding was vegan \u2013 and waste-free, of course.\n\n\u201cThe only beverages served were wine and water, without plastic bottles. All the food scraps were composted,\u201d Shalom explained.\n\nLike the Ors in Jerusalem, Esti Hermesh, 33, of Ashkelon had lived in an ecological community in Costa Rica.
