He wrote: \u201cThere comes a point when the only thing to do is to stand up to this behaviour, because it destroys people and destroys lives. Put simply, it is bullying, which scares and silences people. We all know this isn\u2019t acceptable, at any level. We won\u2019t and can\u2019t believe in a world where there is no accountability for this.\n\n\u201cThough this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one \u2026 I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.\n\n\u201cI lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u201d\n\nThe Sun breached guidelines with Harry and Meghan story Read more\n\nThe statement, issued on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s official website on Tuesday, was published as Meghan moved to start proceedings in the high court over the misuse of private information, infringement of copyright and breach of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nThe Guardian reported this year that the Mail on Sunday was being threatened with legal action because the authors of letters retain ownership of the copyright even after the physical correspondence is in the possession of another individual. Pursuing legal action on this narrow basis also gives the royals a greater chance of success against DMG Media, formerly Associated Newspapers, which also owns the Daily Mail and MailOnline \u2013 both of which have run a substantial number of stories about Meghan.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday has run multiple embarrassing stories involving the duchess\u2019s father, Thomas Markle, including staged paparazzi photographs of him visiting an internet cafe to read about his daughter\u2019s engagement to the prince.\n\nOther critical coverage of the couple has ranged from their use of private jets to their refusal to allow media coverage of the christening of their baby son Archie or name his godparents. They have also been criticised for the \u00a32.4m cost to the public purse for renovations at their Windsor home, Frogmore Cottage.\n\nHowever, the royals have limited ability to stop the publication of such stories, prompting the decision to focus on the publication of Meghan\u2019s letter to her father.\n\nThe photographs of the letter remain available on MailOnline. A spokesman for the newspaper stood by its reporting, setting up a potential court showdown: \u201cThe Mail on Sunday stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously. Specifically, we categorically deny that the Duchess\u2019s letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.\u201d\n\nMeghan and Harry, who are on a 10-day tour of southern Africa, have employed the libel lawyers Schillings, using private funds to bring the case.\n\nIn his statement, Harry emphasised that he and Meghan believed in \u201cmedia freedom and objective, truthful reporting\u201d as a \u201ccornerstone of democracy\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specifically when it is knowingly false and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face \u2013 as so many of you can relate to \u2013 I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been.\n\n\u201cBecause in today\u2019s digital age, press fabrications are repurposed as truth across the globe. One day\u2019s coverage is no longer tomorrow\u2019s chip-paper.\n\n\u201cI have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long. To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\u201d\n\nThe statement is unprecedented in the scale of its attack on the media, although it is far from the first time Harry has taken on the press.\n\nWhen news of his relationship with Meghan Markle became public, he criticised \u201cracial overtones\u201d in reporting.\n\nLast week, it emerged he had complained to the BBC for broadcasting and publishing online an image from a neo-Nazi social media site that called him a \u201crace traitor\u201d and depicted the royal with a gun pointed at his head. Although the BBC internally and the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom rejected the complaint, ruling that the use of the image in a report about the activities of the group was in the public interest, the BBC did apologise for not warning the duke in advance.\n\nHis latest statement accused the British tabloid press of waging a \u201cruthless\u201d campaign against Meghan that had \u201cescalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son\u201d.\n\nHarry, said the recent positive coverage of their African tour exposed \u201cthe double standards of this specific press pack that has vilified her almost daily for the past nine months; they have been able to create lie after lie at her expense simply because she has not been visible while on maternity leave\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe is the same woman she was a year ago on our wedding day, just as she is the same woman you\u2019ve seen on this Africa tour.\n\n\u201cFor these select media, this is a game and one we have been unwilling to play from the start.\u201d\n\nA legal spokesperson for Schillings said: \u201cWe have initiated legal proceedings against the Mail on Sunday, and its parent company Associated Newspapers, over the intrusive and unlawful publication of a private letter written by the Duchess of Sussex, which is part of a campaign by this media group to publish false and deliberately derogatory stories about her, as well as her husband.\n\n\u201cGiven the refusal of Associated Newspapers to resolve this issue satisfactorily, we have issued proceedings to redress this breach of privacy, infringement of copyright and the aforementioned media agenda.\u201d", "description": "Prince compares wife\u2019s treatment to Diana\u2019s as proceedings over private letter are announced", "authors": ["Jim Waterson", "Caroline Davies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/401f1e303eb3fb3509c33f3d226935417945de0d/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5c0f1598ca101f1c5239bbe22daeb5be", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
