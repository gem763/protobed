Until recently it was America\u2019s most highly valued private company with 527,000 tenants, or \u201cmembers\u201d, as WeWork calls them, worldwide.\n\nTwo thousand jobs is about 13% of WeWork\u2019s 15,000 staff and few inside the company believe the cuts will stop there. WeWork declined to comment.\n\nThe cuts come after WeWork was forced to pull its share sale and new management moves to staunch the company\u2019s huge losses.\n\nInternally, staff say little or no work is getting done as workers prepare for the layoffs and new projects are put on hold. But the timing of the sackings is uncertain, not least because WeWork is now in active discussions to raise money before it runs out of cash next year.\n\nAfter years of breakneck growth, new openings have all but stopped in WeWork\u2019s two largest markets, New York and London, as landlords worry about the company\u2019s future.\n\nThe company\u2019s $850m deal to buy the landmark Lord & Taylor department store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan is in trouble. And two large landlords in London, where WeWork has leased about 3.7m sq ft since 2014, recently told the Financial Times they would not sign new leases for the foreseeable future.\n\nOne worker, who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisals, said: \u201cThe atmosphere is toxic. A lot of people worked so hard for this company. We thought we were in on something really big.\u201d\n\nIn online chats on WeWork\u2019s Slack channel, obtained by the Guardian, staff shared memes about Adam Neumann, WeWork\u2019s co-founder and the man many blame for the company\u2019s dramatic fall from grace.\n\nSome WeWork executives were in line for million-dollar payouts if the sale had gone ahead and are now likely to get nothing and could even lose their jobs.\n\nOne worker said: \u201cI left crypto to join an even more ludicrous \u2018parody, IRL [in real life]\u2019 enterprise. Didn\u2019t even think that was possible.\u201d\n\nNeumann, 40, cashed in around $700m of his own shares in WeWork before a share sale that at one point valued WeWork at $47bn. The company has begun attracting larger tenants, including IBM and Microsoft. The Guardian uses a WeWork space in California.\n\nBut the company\u2019s losses have grown as quickly as its business. After investors began querying WeWork\u2019s business model and Neumann\u2019s stewardship of the company, that figure was slashed by more than half and WeWork decided to pull its initial public offering (IPO).\n\nStaff said they had concerns about the influence that Neumann\u2019s wife, Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, had at the company. The cousin of Gwyneth Paltrow, Neumann\u2019s \u201cstrategic thought partner\u201d had been in charge of succession planning should anything happen to her husband, and was the company\u2019s chief brand and impact officer.\n\nWeWork insiders said she had an outsized influence on hiring and new business ideas. The company\u2019s decision to launch WeGrow, a \u201cconscious entrepreneurial\u201d private primary school run inside WeWork\u2019s headquarters, was spearheaded by Paltrow Neumann. Multiple employees lost their jobs at WeWork after Paltrow Neumann met them and she didn\u2019t like their energy, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe school will now close and Paltrow Neumann has been barred from serving on the company\u2019s board.\n\nThe company was expected to raise as much as $4bn from the share sale and had lined up a $6bn bank loan, contingent on the IPO. The decision to pull the sale has left WeWork scrambling for cash.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Softbank, the Japanese investment firm that is WeWork\u2019s largest investor, and JP Morgan Chase are now considering bailing out the office rentals company. The investment would further dilute Neumann\u2019s control of the company.\n\nThe company is currently burning through $700m a quarter. Last year it lost $1.6bn and it had $2.5bn in cash as of 30 June. At the current rate, We, as WeWork\u2019s parent company is called, would run out of money after the first quarter of 2020, according analysts Sanford C Bernstein & Co.\n\nNewly installed co-CEOs Sebastian Gunningham and Artie Minson have already begun the cost-cutting process, halting new leases and putting a $60m G650ER jet bought under Neumann\u2019s reign up for sale.\n\nNeumann landed on Forbes\u2019 list of the world\u2019s richest people earlier this year with a net worth of $4.1bn. Forbes has now lowered its estimate of his wealth to at most $600m.\n\nOn Monday, Business Insider reported that WeWork tenants had received an email informing them of \u201cpotentially elevated levels of formaldehyde\u201d in phone booths throughout WeWork offices in the US and Canada. The company is pulling 1,600 phone booths that \u201cmay be impacted\u201d and an additional 700 phone booths have yet to be tested for formaldehyde.", "description": "Troubled office rental company to lay off 13% of its workforce to try to staunch massive losses \u2013 and few believe the cuts will stop there", "authors": ["Dominic Rushe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfa8b994319754053a887bce1c5565aed67dc1e3/0_118_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c16650a40e93012af3657a7eb3073b6c", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
