As a result several customer-facing systems \u2014 including the city\u2019s website, e-services and billing systems \u2014 have been shut down as a precaution,\u201d it adds.\n\nIt\u2019s believed the attack took place in the early hours of October 25, when the criminals disabled the city\u2019s website and all related online services.\n\nSeveral city employees said they received a ransom note saying: \u201cAll your servers and data have been hacked. We have dozens of back doors inside your city. We have control of everything in your city. We also compromised all passwords and sensitive data such as finance and personal population information.\u201d\n\nThe alleged hack coincided with several banks reporting internet problems, which are thought to be related to the attack.\n\nLocal security experts and police are running an investigation, but it\u2019s worth noting the attack comes amid a flurry of similar incidents in other parts of the world.\n\nIn early September, a hacker held the computer systems of a southern Spanish city, demanding a Bitcoin ransom to unlock them.\n\nAbout a month later, several US hospitals opted for paying the requested ransom payments (likely in cryptocurrency) after being targetted with Ryuk ransomware.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s important to bear in mind that experts typically advise not to pay the ransom, this is unlikely to deter criminals from trying their luck.", "description": "A group of cybercriminals calling themselves the \u201cShadow Kill Hackers\u201d has reportedly\u00a0attacked the City of Johannesburg administration site \u2014 and is threatening to upload the stolen data on the internet unless it receives a Bitcoin ransom.", "authors": ["Yessi Bello Perez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FHacker-ransomware-bitcoin.jpg&signature=4859a558b60218ed8c9f25030ec450fb", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
