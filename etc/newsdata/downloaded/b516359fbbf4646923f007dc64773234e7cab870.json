The embassy found out about her arrest on Friday.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s being accused of working for Israeli security services,\u201d said Ganenko, citing Yuzik\u2019s mother who briefly spoke to her daughter after her arrest. \u201cWe have not yet received official notification from the local authorities.\u201d\n\nAccording to her ex-husband Boris Voytsekhovskiy, the 38-year-old Yuzik was arrested by members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) after they broke down her hotel door. The IRGC is sanctioned as a terrorist organization by the United States.\n\n\u201cThe representative of Russia\u2019s consulate is now at the Iranian foreign ministry trying to resolve this issue,\u201d he told Al Jazeera, adding that she had previously visited Iran as a journalist. \u201c[This time] she just went there as a private person. She just went there, stayed at the hotel, chatted with local journalists.\u201d\n\nVoytsekhovskiy explained that his ex-wife \u201chas no lawyer and an Iranian court will decide on Saturday whether to let her go or press formal charges and keep her in custody.\u201d\n\nHe also contended that she \u201cdid not hold joint Israeli citizenship or a visa for that country and last visited Israel about 15 or 17 years ago to report on the Israeli army\u2019s daily life for Russia\u2019s Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.\u201d\n\nYuzik rose to journalistic prominence in 2003 with her book, Allah\u2019s Brides, which explores the lives of female suicide bombers in the heavily Muslim-populated Russian region of North Caucasus. She has previously worked as a reporter for Komsomolskaya Pravda and Russian Newsweek journal.\n\nThe arrest of Russian nationals in Iran is unusual given how the two countries maintain strong economic and diplomatic relations, with Moscow providing Tehran with their firm backing against U.S.-led sanctions on the Iranian regime.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "The Russian Foreign Ministry summoned the Iranian Ambassador to Moscow, Mehdi Sanai, on Friday to explain the detention of a Russian national.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/yulia-yuzik-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
