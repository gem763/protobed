We wanted to learn as much as we could about it, how it was created and what it was made of to help us avoid further fatbergs in future.\n\n\u2018The results confirm our suspicions, that fat and non-flushable products such as wipes are the main culprits, and that fatbergs are a consequence of the individual and collective impact that our behaviour has on our environment.\n\n\u201dWe will be using these results to help us education, inform and change the behaviours of people in terms of what they are putting down the toilet and sink. That\u2019s not just applicable to Sidmouth, but across our region.\n\n\u2018We really do need the help of the people of Sidmouth and the South West to prevent another fatberg forming. Please only flush the 3Ps \u2013 pee, paper and poo \u2013 down the loo and to dispose of fat, oil and grease in the bin not down the sink.\u2019", "description": "A set of false teeth was found inside the gigantic chunk of nastiness.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88338362_1570183722.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
