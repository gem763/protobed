As Wired noted earlier this summer, teens on TikTok have turned life under Life360 into a meme. One video, with more than half a million views, tells teens how to change their phone settings to trick the app into freezing their location (the advice is accompanied by the sneaky music from Luigi\u2019s Mansion). Others have made videos meme-ing the despair of having your parents find out about the surveillance-dodging app. One asks viewers to like the video if they hate Life360. It has more than 130,000 likes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs much as technology has shaped the behaviors and expectations of Generation Z, it\u2019s done the same to their parents, who can monitor communications and control how much time their kids spend on apps or games with eerie exactitude. Gen Z is now entering adulthood, and both its members and their parents are reckoning with the consequences of a world in which you can, with an app, always know exactly what your child is up to. Some parents are opting to keep this tether as their kids enter college.\n\nThe Life360 stories shared online by teens and young adults depict a range of experiences. Some are logical extensions of a world of technology-infused parenting, where phones are simultaneously central to teenagers\u2019 social lives and tools of surveillance. For instance, some parents will only turn over the car keys if their newly licensed 16-year-old consents to being monitored by a paid version of the app that tracks driving speed. Other stories show how the app can amplify and extend over-controlling parenting into young adulthood. In some cases, young people have described their parents using Life360 in ways that resemble emotional abuse.\n\nOne viral Reddit post, which appeared on r/advice, was from a 19-year-old man who said his conservative, religious parents forced him to download Life360 after he came out to them as gay. In another anonymous post, someone claiming to be a college sophomore lamented the fact that his parents called him whenever they saw something on the app that made them suspect he was doing something they wouldn\u2019t like. \u201cI feel that this is really unhealthy for both my parents and me,\u201d that person wrote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe exchange between the mom and the son who turned off the app got more than 32,000 upvotes (making it super viral, for Reddit). It prompted Chris Hulls, the CEO and founder of Life360, to make himself available for an \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d discussion on the site \u2014 Reddit\u2019s version of a news conference, where anyone can submit a question anonymously. Hulls, who introduced himself as Life360\u2032s \u201cmisunderstood\u201d CEO, was peppered with questions about Life360\u2032s implications for abusive families. Abuse \u201chas not come up as much of an issue\u201d before, he replied.\n\nThe Q&A left many readers unsatisfied. In an email to The Washington Post, Hulls described the critics of the app, and his Reddit performance, as \u201ca small vocal group which doesn\u2019t really reflect the sentiment of our entire user base.\u201d The CEO cited several examples of tracking services helping parents find kids in emergency situations and said he believed the user experience was \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d positive, citing reviews of Life360 on Google and Apple\u2019s app stores.\n\nAs to whether the app might exacerbate abusive behavior, Hulls acknowledged there is a risk. \u201cAlthough rare, if the app is being used improperly, we have a responsibility to help and prevent that,\u201d he told The Post, adding that Life360 planned to provide access to an \u201canonymous hotline\u201d for users who need help.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe pros and cons of tracking children once they leave home is a frequent topic of discussion on Grown and Flown Parents, a closed Facebook group for parents of high school- and college-age children with more than 130,000 members. Several members who agreed to answer questions said they like the \u201cpeace of mind\u201d it gives them about their kids\u2019 safety.\n\nAnna Lee Baird, who lives in Raleigh, N.C., said she uses it on all her children, including her daughter Cameron, who is a sophomore at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cAs she\u2019s gone off to college, I really never had a conversation with her about what that meant for Life360,\u201d Baird said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t remove her; she didn\u2019t ask me to.\u201d She said she doesn\u2019t check the app very much and it\u2019s mainly there just in case of an emergency.\n\n\u201cBecause my parents don\u2019t track me with the intention of micromanaging me, but for safety, I don\u2019t have an issue with it,\u201d Cameron Baird told The Post via text.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMichele Webb said she had to wean herself off constantly checking on her daughter with the Life360 app. \u201cWhen she first got her license, I was a stalker,\u201d she said. Her daughter has since gone to college, and Webb says she\u2019s gotten better about it: \u201cNow I only use it if I know she\u2019s traveling and I want to see if she\u2019s made it to where she said she\u2019s going.\u201d\n\nSome parents in the online group said they were wary of tracking apps. Amanda Nichols, who lives in Cleburne, Tex., said she didn\u2019t plan to use tracker apps on her 18-year-old. \u201d My son is a grown adult,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand I am not about to track his moves while he is out trying to find his way in this world.\u201d\n\nWhen parents and kids already have a relationship that includes a degree of privacy, trust and independence, the downsides of tracking apps like Life360 don\u2019t necessarily seem like that big of a deal. But on boards like r/insaneparents and r/raisedbynarcissists, teens and young adults are sharing the darker side effects of the technology.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIvy, a freshman at a religious university in the Midwest, wrote a post on Reddit saying that Life360 was extending a troubled childhood with controlling parents. She told The Post that her parents insist she has Life360 turned on at all times at college as a condition of paying for her to go. (Ivy is a nickname; the woman didn\u2019t want to be fully identified for fear of complicating an already difficult relationship. For this reason, The Post did not contact her parents.)\n\nIvy sent The Post screen shots that appeared to show messages from her mother.\n\n\u201cI hear you went to climb a mountain today. I did not see it on Life360,\u201d Ivy\u2019s mother appeared to write in one of the messages. \u201cI have asked you to carry your phone with you. It looks like you are wanting to begin paying for your own rent, tuition/textbooks, and living expenses.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnother screen shot showed nearly two dozen emails from her mother in the span of a few hours, which Ivy said she received after turning off her location on the app.\n\n\u201cIt was supposedly for my safety, she said, \u201cbut I never had the option to refuse.\u201d\n\nHer story was one of many that have found their way to Reddit. John Caffaro, a professor at the California School of Professional Psychology and an expert in family and sibling abuse, viewed several of the posts about Life360 and other tracking services on r/insaneparents and other discussion boards. \u201cMany of the Reddit posts appeared to drift perilously close to what normally constitutes emotional abuse,\u201d Caffaro told The Post in an email.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn the hands of an abusive parent, a tracking app like Life360 may have serious implications for a child\u2019s interpersonal adjustment,\u201d Caffaro wrote. When constant parental surveillance continues into young adulthood, he said, it can make it harder for young adults to make friends and \u201ccontribute to feelings of loneliness.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOne woman, who said she was a 21-year-old college senior, told The Post that Life360 has caused her significant anxiety. (Fearing retaliation from her parents, she too asked not to be named.) The app makes her feel like she\u2019s not making her own decisions, she said, and that makes her feel helpless. \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t know how to do anything at all on my own,\u201d she said.\n\nMany parents install tracking apps with good intentions, said Stacey Steinberg, a law professor at the University of Florida who has studied how technology impacts raising families and privacy. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our kids to screw up,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them to get hurt. Technology offers us new ways to feel like we are protecting them \u2014 both from others and from themselves.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBut kids need autonomy from their parents, especially when they reach adulthood,\u201d Steinberg added. \u201cIf we want our kids to trust us, if we want our kids to believe they are capable of making wise decisions, then our actions need to show it. Valuing their privacy is one way to do so.\u201d\n\nMore reading", "description": "As Gen Z grows up and goes to college, some parents are using technology to keep a close watch", "authors": ["Reporter Covering Digital Culture"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/l7raUFkyEcgCVVKEsKBGtwVCdfc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J6WJMOQUMBAZTO72L4VCIXBTZE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
