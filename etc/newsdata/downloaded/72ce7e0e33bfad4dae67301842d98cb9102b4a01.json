It shows a commander in chief consumed by conspiracy theories, strong-arming a foreign government to help him politically, and marshaling the federal government in his schemes.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump said that his call with Zelensky \u201cwas largely congratulatory,\u201d but the account of the call tells a different story. (It\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s unclear how the account of the conversation was constructed\u2014whether it was transcribed in real time or taped\u2014nor is it possible to independently verify its accuracy. A note at the bottom cautions that it \u201cis not a verbatim transcript of a discussion.\u201d) Trump congratulates Zelensky on his election, and then begins to complain that Germany isn\u2019t contributing enough money to Ukraine. (Trump yesterday cited supposedly weak European support as a justification for freezing U.S. aid for months.)\n\nRead more: What happened in Ukraine?\n\nThen comes the really crazy stuff. Trump begins speaking about the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election:\n\nI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people \u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you\u2019re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you said yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it\u2019s very important that you do it if that\u2019s possible.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to puzzle out quite what Trump is talking about. The call took place the day after Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony to the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees. CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity firm that conducted work on behalf of the Democratic National Committee and accused Russia of having hacked the DNC\u2019s servers. Ukraine has been a locus of pro-Trump conspiracy theories about the 2016 election, which claim that Ukraine\u2019s government was aiming to assist Hillary Clinton. It is not clear, however, what \u201cserver\u201d Trump is referring to.", "description": "The White House said a transcript of the call would be exculpatory\u2014but the summary it released only adds to the problems facing Trump.", "authors": ["David A.
