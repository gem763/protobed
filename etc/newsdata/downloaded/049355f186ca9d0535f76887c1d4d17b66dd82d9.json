Six months ago, I must tell you, I was quite pessimistic about everything. I would see no movement, now I see a lot of movement and we need to boost that movement.\u201d\n\nGuterres said he expects \u201cvery meaningful\u201d climate commitments to be made by countries during the summit on Monday, which was thrown open to world leaders who had new initiatives on cutting planet-warming gases to announce.\n\nI feel that we are still running late and we need to accelerate. The next few years are absolutely crucial Ant\u00f3nio Gutteres\n\nRepresentatives from around 60 countries will speak, including Angela Merkel, chancellor of Germany, India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi and Boris Johnson, the British prime minister.\n\nThe summit is designed to sharply prod countries to do more to meet the commitments of the Paris climate accords, where governments agreed to limit the average global temperature rise to 2C above the pre-industrial era. The world has already warmed by around 1C since this time.\n\nProgress has been limited. Global emissions hit a record high last year, Donald Trump has said the US, the world\u2019s second-largest emitter, will quit the Paris deal and Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has opened the way to raze vast tracts of the Amazon rainforest.\n\nGuterres said neither Brazil nor the US have \u201cturned up\u201d with any new commitments for the UN summit.\n\n\u201cClearly, we are lagging behind and that there are many resistances in many areas,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel that we are still running late and we need to accelerate. The next few years are absolutely crucial to reverse the present trend, that is still a negative trend.\n\n\u201cEmissions are still growing and the situation is getting worse, clearly. I am deeply convinced that climate change is the defining issue of our time.\u201d\n\nThe daunting task of staving off disastrous climate change has been laid bare in a new analysis released by the UN that shows global emissions are not estimated to peak by 2030, the year when scientists say emissions must be slashed by nearly half from now to avoid devastating heatwaves, flooding and loss of species.\n\nThis dire forecast, driven by the continued dominance of fossil fuels despite the growth of alternatives such as solar and wind power, means countries will need to at least triple their current emissions reduction commitments to meet the Paris target, the UN report states.\n\nThe G20, the world\u2019s wealthiest countries, represent 80% of emissions but are according to the UN doing \u201cnowhere near enough\u201d to scale up their ambition, eclipsed by developing countries that in the case of low-lying countries in Asia and the Pacific are at most peril from rising seas and drought.\n\nGuterres, who has called for net zero emissions by 2050 and the end of new coal projects from next year, said he expects countries will do more, although he admitted he was concerned by a spate of new coal mines backed by China.\n\nPlay Video 2:16 How the climate strike travelled around the world - video\n\nOn the Trump administration, the secretary general said: \u201cOf course we understand that the policy that exists today is not in line with this concern [of climate change].\u201d\n\nThe UN summit is set to provide a sobering counterpoint to Friday\u2019s global climate strikes, where millions across 150 countries skipped work or school in order to protest inaction over the climate crisis.\n\nGuterres said pressure from young people, galvanized by the Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg, will be \u201cfundamental\u201d in shaping the response from countries.\n\nIt appears however to have made little impression on Trump, who will pointedly be at the UN on Monday to attend a gathering on religious freedom rather than the climate summit.\n\nClimate strikes: hoax photo accusing Australian protesters of leaving rubbish behind goes viral Read more\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think other countries feel there\u2019s much point putting pressure on President Trump because he hasn\u2019t put off any signal in changing,\u201d said Todd Stern, who was US special envoy for climate change during the Paris negotiations.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of the US there is some lack of energy in the overall system so it\u2019s good that the secretary general is convening people and pushing them hard.\u201d\n\nSome major businesses have set out new goals, with a group of 87 companies \u2013 including Nestle, Nokia and L\u2019Oreal \u2013 on Sunday committing to net zero emissions by 2050. But the abdication of the US looms large.\n\n\u201cThe EU and China are the parties that can take this forward,\u201d said Frank Rijsberman, director general of the Global Green Growth Institute. \u201cIt looks like we will have to wait until there\u2019s another US president.\u201d\n\nThe summit will be considered a success with a raft of new national commitments but it\u2019s clear that even that may not be enough.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for something that will begin to bend that curve,\u201d said Mary Robinson, former UN high commissioner for human rights. \u201cAnd until it begins to bend, we\u2019re not there at all.\u201d", "description": "United Nations hosts climate summit in New York on Monday, as new data shows 2014-19 warmest five-year period on record", "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfd208577ef876e13a92f19379bc6cc98afe7816/0_147_4749_2850/master/4749.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0fc7783b7b67150aa99d1c6afa483e27", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
