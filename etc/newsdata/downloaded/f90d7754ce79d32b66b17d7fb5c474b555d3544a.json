He died later at a local hospital, The Daily Beast and The Telegraph reported.\n\nShe had been in the country for two weeks at the time, The Daily Beast reported. The US and UK drive on different sides of the road.\n\nNorthamptonshire Police has not yet responded to Insider's request for confirmation regarding details of the crash and Dunn's death, and how long Anne Sacoolas has been in the UK at the time.\n\nWho is #AnneSacoolas?

However, she and her family have since returned home to the US after claiming diplomatic immunity.\n\nSacoolas and her family - including three children - were privately flown out of a military air base in the UK shortly after the crash, The Telegraph reported. Someone on the American base had advised the family to return home to the US, Sky News reported.\n\nAccording to the 1961 Vienna Convention, people registered as diplomats and their families are legally entitled to claim immunity from being tried in their host country as long as they are not nationals there as well.\n\nHowever, her husband - named by UK and US media as Jonathan Sacoolas - does not appear in the UK's official list of diplomats, inviting speculation that the family didn't have the right to claim diplomatic immunity to leave.\n\nMark Stephens, a British lawyer specialising in constitutional and diplomatic law, said this means the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Northamptonshire Police may not have had the right to let the family leave.\n\nReferring to the Vienna Convention, Stephens told Sky News: \"That treaty though doesn't bind Northamptonshire Police and it doesn't bind the family of this poor boy who was deceased, and as a consequence they can apply for her extradition to come back to face manslaughter charges.\"\n\nSources close to the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the prime minister's office however, told Insider that Jonathan Sacoolas had the right to diplomatic immunity.\n\nThe prime ministerial source also told Insider that the Anne and Jonathan Sacoolas don't appear on the diplomatic list because it only contains the names of people based in missions in London.\n\nIt does not encompass all the names of people in the UK with the right to diplomatic immunity, the source added.\n\nThe FCO has not responded to Insider's request for comment on Stephens' remarks.\n\nNorthamptonshire Police has not yet responded to Insider's request for comment on whether Anne Sacoolas had the right to leave, and their next steps in the case.\n\nDunn's death and Sacoolas' departure have since been escalated to the highest echelons of US and UK government. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday publicly urged Sacoolas to return to the UK to face questioning.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also discussed the issue with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday.\n\n\"If we can't resolve it, then of course I will be raising it myself, personally, with the White House,\" Johnson said.\n\nDunn's parents have also appealed for Sacoolas to return to the UK to face questioning. They have set up a GoFundMe campaign to raise \u00a310,000 (R185,000) and vowed to set up a legal campaign to prevent people from claiming diplomatic immunity in such circumstances.\n\nI cannot believe how badly the Dunn family have been treated. Lacking humanity and common decency. https://t.co/leQHLxKYJy \u2014 Mark Stephens (@MarksLarks) October 9, 2019\n\nStephens, the lawyer, told the BBC \"Breakfast\" program on Wednesday that Dunn's parents should travel to the US to sue Sacoolas.\n\nThe British government \"should actually be funding the family\" to sue Sacoolas in the US \"so they can get the explanation they so richly deserve,\" he told Sky News.\n\n\"I cannot believe how badly the Dunn family have been treated,\" Stephens tweeted. \"Lacking humanity and common decency.\"", "description": "Anne Sacoolas is suspected of fatally hitting 19-year-old Harry Dunn with her car in Northamptonshire, England, in late August.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9453/79c2d58d69974f9980b5900236ea55a1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
