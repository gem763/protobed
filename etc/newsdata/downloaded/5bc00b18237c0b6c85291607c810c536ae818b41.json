Is he a 'foreign agent'?", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Rudolph Giuliani\u2019s ties to Ukraine stretch back to at least 2008, when he announced that his firm was advising a former boxing champion who was running to be mayor of the capital city of Kiev.\n\nThen, in 2017, about a year before President Donald Trump hired him to be his personal attorney, Giuliani Safety & Security began working for the city of Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine. Press releases described the firm as a consultant on Kharkiv's emergency response and security issues.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s emergence as a central figure in an effort to push Ukraine to investigate Trump\u2019s potential presidential rival \u2013 a scandal that has led to an impeachment inquiry \u2013 has raised fresh questions about the former New York City mayor\u2019s business ties and public appearances in Ukraine and other countries. One possible line of inquiry \u2013 and one that Senate Democrats have been pushing \u2013 is whether Giuliani's activities violate a federal law that requires Americans who work on behalf of foreign governments to register with the Justice Department.\n\nThis comes as the Justice Department has stepped up its use of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, an 80-year-old law that Democrats say Giuliani may be violating. Once toothless and antiquated, the statute found its way into the public consciousness in the last two years at the height of the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and has been used to prosecute several people, including two men who once were close Trump advisers.\n\nThe ramped-up enforcement has dramatically changed the landscape not only for lobbyists for foreign governments, but also for others with foreign clients: international law firms, consultants and public relations specialists who, for years, have ignored FARA, experts say.\n\nSome don't register because of the administrative burden and the stigma of being labeled a \u201cforeign agent,\u201d experts say. Parties also avoid registering in order to keep relationships with foreign governments and officials secret.\n\nPaul Manafort sentenced: Former Trump adviser gets 7.5 years in prison\n\nMichael Flynn: Prosecutors leave open possibility of prison for Trump's former adviser\n\nGiuliani, who did not respond to requests for comment and has hired a former Watergate prosecutor to represent him, told the Washington Post that his work for foreign governments doesn't require him to register because it doesn\u2019t involve lobbying the U.S., and he dismissed questions about his foreign clients as \"diversions by Democrats.\"\n\nBut legal experts say Giuliani's comments represent a misunderstanding of how broad the FARA statute is, and the Justice Department's renewed focus on enforcing it should put him on notice.\n\n\"I think at the very least, the Department of Justice would be justified in taking a very close look at the arrangements that (Giuliani) has with these foreign principals. ... Given the backdrop, given the new changes in enforcement priorities, this would seem to be a case that would be ripe for the DOJ to at least ask questions,\" said Josh Rosenstein, a Washington, D.C. lawyer who advises clients on FARA.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.\n\nRudy Giuliani: From 'America's mayor' to Trump's pit bull: he emerges as central figure in Ukraine firestorm\n\nUkraine ties under scrutiny\n\nGiuliani\u2019s business ties in Ukraine spilled into public view in September, following a whistleblower\u2019s allegations that he was a \u201ccentral figure\u201d in an effort to pressure the country\u2019s newly elected president into investigating former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nHouse Democrats have subpoenaed records, including contracts that Giuliani and his security consulting firm had with his Ukrainian clientele. The long list of documents that the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has demanded suggests a broad inquiry into possible FARA violations.\n\nAmong the documents requested pertain to \u201cengagements, consulting, advising, or lobbying work\u201d done by Giuliani or his firm on behalf of Ukrainian officials.\n\nOne of the Ukrainian clients that House investigators are focusing on is Pavel Fuks, a wealthy Ukrainian-Russian developer, who hired Giuliani\u2019s firm to help improve Kharkiv's emergency services and international image. Fuks previously described Giuliani as a \u201clobbyist\u201d for the city and for Ukraine.", "description": "Rudy Giuliani's emergence as a central figure in the impeachment inquiry has raised questions about his business ties with foreign governments.", "authors": ["Kristine Phillips", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0EaABcA6Kws3v1iAumznYQ--~B/aD0xNjY5O3c9MjUwNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/a16e1349feef9e059a4d203b4de97007", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
