His fury is palpable.\n\n\u201cThey called us animals!\u201d he rails from the pulpit as women in the pews before him click their tongues in disgust. \u201cNow there are anti-racist protests all over. It is like an earthquake!\u201d\n\nIgnited by malicious racial slurs two weeks ago, the protests in West Papua have spread and intensified, with thousands taking to the streets in a series of rolling and in some cases violent demonstrations.\n\nOn Thursday angry demonstrators torched parliament and police buildings in Jayapura. Police fired tear gas and six hundred extra paramilitary troops have been deployed to the city. At least six people have been killed as the volatile situation, unfolding in a region for decades roiled by separatist conflict, escalates daily.\n\nThe Guardian travelled to West Papua, obtaining rare access to the province\u2019s leading pro-independence figures at a pivotal moment for the province. On the ground there was seething anger and resentment, but also hope that the rage on the streets will transform into real momentum for independence.\n\n\u201cThe protests are a spontaneous action against racism,\u201d says Victor Yeimo, from the West Papua National Committee, which advocates a non-violent struggle to achieve self-determination. \u201cBut what people want is freedom.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Victor Yeimo, from the West Papua National Committee.

Lying more than 4,000km from the Indonesian capital Jakarta is home to some of the largest tracts of rainforest after the Amazon, and a bounty of gold, copper, timber and natural gas.\n\nBut the region is riven by deep divisions. The protests that began in early August were sparked by a viral video that showed Indonesian military officers taunting Papuan students in the Javanese city of Surabaya, calling them \u201cmonkeys\u201d, \u201cpigs\u201d and \u201cdogs\u201d.\n\nThey have since spread to almost 30 cities inside and outside West Papua. There, demonstrators have flown the banned Morning Star flag, a symbol of Papuan independence, and held signs reading: \u201cPapua merdeka, itu yang monyet inginkan,\u201d \u2013 \u201cFree Papua, this is what the monkeys want.\u201d\n\nAfter a market and government building were torched, the government in Jakarta sent more than 1,000 security personnel into the already heavily militarised province, sparking fears the protests would be put down with force.\n\nBut they have continued, spreading to Jayapura and the remote highlands, where thousands of Papuans in traditional dress carrying sticks, bows and arrows rallied to express their indignation.\n\nAmid the unrest, key figures in the independence movement have seized on the momentum.\n\nWhy are there violent clashes in Papua and West Papua? Read more\n\nDescribing the situation as a \u201ccrisis of history\u201d, Giay urged parishioners in church to educate their children so they could \u201cbecome like Moses\u201d, leading their people out of slavery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a new time has come and we have to reposition ourselves,\u201d Giay told the Guardian after the sermon, as churchgoers walked back up the mountain, well-thumbed Bibles in hand.\n\n\u2018We have never had a choice\u2019\n\nFor indigenous Papuans, the demonstrations that began as a fight against racism have ignited decades of anger that date back to colonialism.\n\nWhile Indonesia and its resource-rich spice islands were granted independence from the Netherlands in 1949, West Papua, then known as West Irian, remained under Dutch control until Indonesian troops parachuted in to \u201cliberate\u201d it in 1962. By August that year the territory was temporarily bought under Indonesian control.\n\nIn 1969, the controversial Act of Free Choice, a vote to enable the inhabitants of West Irian to determine their own future, was held. Many Papuans claim it was conducted under duress. Of a population of 800,000 people, some 1,022 Papuans, reportedly hand-picked by Jakarta and kept under military supervision, unanimously voted for integration.\n\nDespite concerns over the process, the United Nations noted the results in Resolution No. 2504, without explicitly endorsing them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People flee as the local market is seen burning during a protest in Fakfak, Papua province, on 21 August. Photograph: Beawiharta/AP\n\nIn the minds of West Papua\u2019s pro-independence leaders the sense of disenfranchisement that characterised the Act of Free Choice has lingered in the Papuan psyche, fuelling a sense of injustice and perpetuating an independence movement that refuses to go away.\n\n\u2018Papuans want freedom\u2019\n\nAcross the Papuan capital, Jayapura, storefronts are adorned with red and white, the colours of the Indonesian flag, decorations from Indonesian independence day celebrations on 17 August. But deep-seated nationalism is hard to find.\n\n\u201cIndonesian nationalism is only a symbol in Papua, a symbol that is forced upon us,\u201d scoffs Victor Yeimo, \u201cHow can we say we are part of Indonesia when we have never had a choice?\u201d\n\nFilep Karma, a prominent independence figure who spent eleven years in jail for flying the banned Morning Star flag, sits on the balcony of his Jayapura home, wearing a camel safari suit, and an East Timorese flag on his cap. The independence symbols, he says, are \u201chis motivations\u201d.\n\n\u201cSometimes in town the military threatens me and says \u2018take off that pin\u2019,\u201d he says of his Morning Star flag badge, \u201cI tell them, \u2018shoot me first, then you can take it off,\u201d he says with a laugh.\n\nFor years Karma says he has warned the Indonesian government about its racism problem, an issue that many Papuans know all to well.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Prominent independence figure Filep Karma. Photograph: Kate Lamb/The Guardian\n\nAs a student in Java, Karma recalls a female friend who was a good singer cracking a joke in front of their friends. If they ever married, she jibed, \u201call the monkeys [Papuans] would know how to sing\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt hit me in the heart,\u201d says Karma, from the balcony of his Jayapura home. \u201cIn church we would say we were brothers, so how could anyone say that?\u201d\n\nIn Indonesia the general view of Papuans, he says, is \u201cpeople with black skin, curly hair, and hairy bodies\u201d who are \u201cstupid, stinky and criminal\u201d. Encountering it on a daily basis, he added, \u201cgets to you psychologically\u201d.\n\nAround Jayapura, banners have been strung up calling for people to reject all forms of racism, but other ethnic divisions are plainly visible.\n\nAt the Jayapura Mall, almost all patrons and salespeople are noticeably non-Papuan. The indigenous Papuans can be found clustered outside in the heat, selling betel nut and woven bags on the pavement.\n\nPapua is a land rich in natural resources, but the indigenous population complain they have not benefited enough from their natural wealth \u2013 across the country Papua has the highest rates of illiteracy and HIV.\n\nPresident Joko Widodo, or \u201cJokowi\u201d, has worked hard to develop Papua, regularly visiting and initiating new infrastructure projects. But there have been bitter disappointments too.\n\nIn 2014 Jokowi promised to solve egregious cases of human rights abuses, but critics say nothing has changed and for many Papuans, getting justice is more important than a new bridge or road.\n\n\u201cThe government needs a humanitarian approach, not a military one if they want to win the hearts of Papuans,\u201d remarked Marinus Yaung, a lecturer in international relations Cendrawasih University in Jayapura.\n\nOn the ground the issue of a referendum on self-determination is a sensitive one to for Papuans, who worry there could be repercussions for what they say.\n\nAt a traditional market one woman answered carefully. \u201cPapuans are happy with Jokowi,\u201d she said, \u201cBut it should be our right to choose.\u201d\n\nOne local journalist who asked not to be named told the Guardian: \u201cIf you ask Papuans if they want freedom, they do.\u201d\n\nEven as the anger in Papua boils over, analysts say it is hard to see how much could change without significant international pressure and support \u2013 something that has been lacking for decades and shows little sign of materialising now.\n\nTo Jakarta\u2019s elite, which vehemently maintains Papua is a legitimate and non-negotiable part of Indonesia, independence for West Papua remains a fanciful suggestion.On Thursday, chief security minister Wiranto said the government would not entertain any demand for an independence vote, according to Kompas.com.\n\n\u201cDemands for referendum I think must not be mentioned. Why? Because the unity of the Republic of Indonesia is final,\u201d Wiranto said.\n\nKarma is used to Jakarta\u2019s intransigence and is realistic about Papuan dreams of independence:\u201cPapua belongs to them, but in our minds it is ours.\u201d", "description": "At a pivotal moment in the region\u2019s struggle for self-determination, there is seething anger as well as hope", "authors": ["Kate Lamb"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7491acdf1de6154116cf84a4576ae17469394fdf/0_256_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4a670c8e8025481ee05a55f10d6b89d2"}
