He has now plowed $5 million of his own money into GE shares this week. The company's top brass has also been buying up shares which rebounded in early trading Friday.\n\nTicker Security Last Change %Chg GE GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY 8.25 +0.14 +1.73%\n\nGE's staunch defense, which continued Friday as the company reached out to investors updating them on the efforts being made to defend the company after the forensic accountant Harry Markopolos, who gained notoriety by flagging Bernie Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme two years before it was dismantled, published a report accusing the company of hiding its problems through fraudulent financial filings.\n\n\u201cThis is my accounting fraud team\u2019s ninth insurance fraud case in the past nine years and it\u2019s the biggest, bigger than Enron and WorldCom combined,\u201d Markopolos said in the report. Enron and Worldcom filed bankruptcy in Dec. 2001 and July 2002, respectively, after their accounting frauds were exposed.\n\nMarkopolos\u2019 report out Thursday concluded GE\u2019s accounting missteps total $38 billion, or about 40% of its market value. The drop in GE shares was the worst in 11 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe fact that he wrote a 170-page paper but never talked to company officials goes to show that he is not interested in accurate financial analysis, but solely in generating downward volatility in GE stock so that he and his undisclosed hedge fund partner can personally profit,\u201d Culp told FOX Business in an emailed statement.\n\nAnd one of GE's independent directors also pushed back against Markopolos' allegations.\n\n\u201cThe representations by Mr. Markopolos about GE\u2019s accounting practices are simply not accurate,\" said GE Independent Director and Audit Committee chair Leslie Seidman, who is also the former chair of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. \"The report contains numerous novel interpretations and downright mistakes about the actual accounting requirements, making his conclusions about GE\u2019s reporting questionable at best.\u201d\n\nCulp\u2019s share purchases come as General Electric\u2019s stock is hovering just above record lows set in December. GE shares have lost more than 40% of their value since June 2018, when the company announced a massive restructuring and was booted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\n\u201cGE will always take any allegation of financial misconduct seriously,\u201d Culp told FOX Business in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cBut this is market manipulation \u2013 pure and simple. Mr. Markopolos\u2019s report contains false statements of fact, and these claims could have been corrected if he had checked them with GE before publishing the report.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nGE's Troubled Timeline:\n\n2018:\n\n2019:", "description": "General Electric is fighting back against a whistle blower who accused it of committing accounting fraud.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/GE-Markopolos-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
