All of it. A true artist. His first show was a week ago, and it was nothing short of electric. Everyone felt it, everyone knew it. He could\u2019ve easily taken the easy route and put music out when he was 12, 14, 16, even 18, but he always said he wanted to live some life and have something to say before he did it. He didn\u2019t want to be a child star, he wanted to be a man with scars and a story to tell. I always admired, respected and encouraged that stand.\"\n\nWe've collected all of their collaborations below, plus the music video for \"Eyes.\"\n\n\"TruDog: The Return\" (2004)\n\n\"Hype Man (truDog '07)\" (2007)\n\n\"LoudNClear (TruDog 10)\" (2010)\n\n\"Mac Daddy (Tru's Reality)\" (2012)\n\n\"Backseat Driver\" (2015)\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/25/tobymac-truett-mckeehan-grew-up-rapping-dad-tobymac-albums/2453624001/", "description": "Fans got to hear McKeehan grow up, as he made appearances on five consecutive TobyMac albums \u2014 often with his own dedicated track\u00a0\u2014 through age 16.", "authors": ["Dave Paulson", "Published A.M.
