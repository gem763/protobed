You\u2019re predictable. I bought treats.\n\n\u2018Can we get this dog the stage, bro?\u2019 he added.\n\nLogan Paul tries to feed KSI\u2019s dog a treat (Picture: Reuters/Tom Jacobs)\n\nUnphased, KSI addressed the crowd saying: \u2018Welcome to London, motherf*****!\u2019\n\nHe then announced he\u2019s calling the lookalike King Kong and gets the crowd to chant his dog\u2019s name.\n\nThen the trash talking started.\n\nKSI said: \u2018I can\u2019t wait to finish you off, bro. He used his dead dog for views, he used a dead guy for views, a parrot death for views \u2013 is there anything that dies that you won\u2019t use for views? That you won\u2019t exploit?\u2019\n\n\u2018Maybe your career after I\u2019m done with it,\u2019 he added.\n\nLogan later responded: \u2018Man, I might kill this man. I might end you. I\u2019mma light you on fire.\u2019\n\nKSI and Logan Paul on stage (Picture: KSI/YouTube)\n\nTrue Geordie then asked both YouTube stars: \u2018What\u2019s your prediction for the fight?\u2019\n\nLogan confidently shot back: \u2018First round decapitation.\u2019\n\nThe rematch is due to take place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Saturday 9 November.\n\nThe first match ended in a majority draw following six rounds of sparring \u2013 in an evening which also saw Logan\u2019s brother Jake Paul go head to head with KSI\u2019s brother Deji.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
