Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nVarious administration employees were providing the whistleblower with information about the president\u2019s overtures to Ukraine for at least four months before the complaint was filed.\n\n\u201cMultiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call informed me that, after an initial exchange of pleasantries, the president used the remainder of the call to advance his personal interests,\u201d the whistleblower said in the complaint.\n\nThe anonymous government employee said multiple White House employees who shared information about the president\u2019s conversation \u201cwere deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call.\u201d\n\nTypically, several U.S. national security employees in the highly secure White House Situation Room will listen in on a president\u2019s phone call with foreign leaders and take notes.\n\nThe whistleblower said about a dozen White House officials listened to the call, including policy aides and national security duty workers.\n\nThe complaint also identifies State Department Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl as another official believed to have been listening to the call.\n\nThe whistleblower refers to himself or herself as a \u201cnon-White House\u201d employee.\n\n\u201cI was not the only non-White House official to receive a readout of the call,\u201d the whistleblower said in the complaint.\n\nUnnamed White House employees also told the whistleblower that they were directed by White House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript of the phone call from the computer system in which such information was typically stored.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
