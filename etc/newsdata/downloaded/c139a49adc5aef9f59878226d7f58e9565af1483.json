So many [stories] come out each day, which say I'm leaving,\" said Koulibaly.\n\n\"Right now, my only objective is to win with Napoli. I don't care about the rest.\n\n\"Our objective remains to beat the best teams in Italy and win the title. This season is more difficult because all the teams have got stronger and Serie A has become more competitive.\n\n\"I haven't made the best start to the season. Juventus remain the team to beat. For our part, we must work even harder, improving our game to get closer to them.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"Our objective is to qualify for the Champions League knockout stage as soon as possible.\n\n\"We started well by beating Liverpool with a top performance. We regret not beating Genk, but that's football. We must think positively and be aware that we can do well. My objective is to help the club and team win a trophy now.\"", "description": "Kalidou Koulibaly is on Man United's wishlist and has been linked with a move to Old Trafford for the past two transfer windows", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20557715.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-EUR-C1-GENK-NAPLES.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
