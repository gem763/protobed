All images: Netflix. (Image: Netflix)\n\nDisenchantment is a different type of Matt Groening show. Unlike The Simpsons and Futurama, Disenchantment is playing a very long and purposeful game. Most of the second season was about teasing bigger stories and plot lines \u2014 sometimes to the detriment of the series itself. But there\u2019s a lot of stuff to pick apart in Part 2 of the Netflix fantasy series... as well as some solid jokes and Futurama references.\n\nI found myself pouring through the second season of Disenchantment, hoping to catch some of the things they\u2019re clearly trying to tease for the audience \u2014 whether it\u2019s some hieroglyphics spotted on the table, next to the map spelling out Maru\u2019s plans for Dreamland, or that creepy music box melody that plays throughout the second season.\n\nSome of them are most likely me reading way too much into things (because that\u2019s what I do) but others are definitely there for a purpose or raise more questions. Here are some of the cooler things I found.\n\nCreepy elves\n\nWho are these guys, what the heck are they doing underneath the castle of Dreamland, and have they been there all along? This is one of the show\u2019s biggest mysteries and one that left us on a cliffhanger.\n\nThe creepy elves were first spotted in season one lurking in the shadows and I also caught one hiding among Prince Derek\u2019s toys in season two\u2019s \u201cLove\u2019s Slimy Embrace.\u201d Clearly they\u2019re important, as not only has Queen Dagmar allied with them as of the end of season two, but it\u2019s clear the regular elves (with pirate captain Leaveo) are looking for the creepy elves \u2014 or, at the very least, something they have.\n\nAtoll K\n\nWhen Bean\u2019s steampunk buddy Sky Gunderson gets ready to take her back to Steamland, he cycles through a couple of automated destinations on his dirigible\u2019s \u201cGPS\u201d before settling on the right one. There was Rat Island (presumably named after the only privately owned island in New York City), as well as Beaverton. But the one that caught my eye was Atoll K.\n\nAtoll K was a disastrous 1951 French film, which starred comedic duo Laurel & Hardy as part of a crew who find themselves in possession of an island that they name Crusoeland. Things quickly go south as members of the crew establish a government that quickly turns corrupt, leaving Laurel out of the loop.\n\nIt was designed to be a political satire, but quickly got lost in slapstick shenanigans and behind-the-scenes problems that are so infamous they\u2019re more interesting than the movie itself.\n\nSymbols\n\nSymbols are a major part of the second season of Disenchantment. In addition to some of the ones we saw last season, like the blue spiral spotted in the church and outside the Enchanted Forest, we\u2019ve also got some new ones that are playing a big part in the series.\n\nThere\u2019s the eye symbol that\u2019s just about everywhere in Maru, including in Bean\u2019s prophecy painting. She spots the eye symbol in the catacombs of Dreamland too, which lures her to one of the castle\u2019s many tiny doors that feature the weird symbol (second from right) that looks like one of those dark-eyed elves wearing a pointy hat.\n\nThen finally, there\u2019s the triangle symbol (on the right), which I eyed during King Z\u00f8g\u2019s trip to the Enchantment Forest in \u201cThe Heart Is The Loneliest Hunter.\u201d Haven\u2019t seen it anywhere else, but it\u2019s raising my eyebrows.\n\nWho is Odval?\n\nZ\u00f8g\u2019s prime minister Odval has a lot more going on than we originally thought. He was introduced as a three-eyed mystic who was part of a secret society that mainly existed for wild orgies. But in the final episodes of the second season, we learned a hell of a lot.\n\nNot only did he and his secret sex society succeed in getting his \u201cpuppet\u201d Prince Derek on the throne (at least temporarily), but he also showed that he\u2019s totally aware of Steamland... including that he knows how to operate a gun. There\u2019s a big open-ended question about where he\u2019s really from, how much he knows about the larger world, and what his secret society is planning. I mean, other than orgies.\n\nThe bear and the maiden fair\n\nDisenchantment has been pretty low-key on its Game of Thrones references; Groening even promised there wouldn\u2019t be a \u201cparade\u201d of nods to the series. But they do throw them in occasionally.\n\nOne of the sweetest (and saddest) stories of season two was about Z\u00f8g\u2019s relationship with a selkie, which in this case was a twist on the original mythology: Instead of a seal, this selkie was a bear. It not only gave Z\u00f8g a formidable and sexy companion, but it also felt like an intentional play on \u201cThe Bear and the Maiden Fair,\u201d a song from George R.R. Martin\u2019s saga that also served as the name of an episode.\n\nLots of Futurama\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a Matt Groening production without a few nods to his previous work. Much like how the first season teased an image of Fry, Bender and the Professor in the time machine from \u201cThe Late Philip J. Fry,\u201d this season is chock full of cute in-jokes and references.\n\nAs seen in the image above, there\u2019s a holophoner in one of the castle\u2019s storage rooms. Bean also finds a drawer of assorted lengths of wire in Sky\u2019s dragon ship (a nod to Futurama\u2019s pilot episode). Z\u00f8g makes not one but two Bender jokes, with \u201cbite my shiny metal axe\u201d and \u201clet\u2019s go already!\u201d A street in Steamland is even named after Professor Farnsworth, something which I\u2019m sure some fans of the Groening shared universe theory will go bananas over.\n\nGertude\u2019s Steins (and more)\n\nOne of my favourite things in Disenchantment is all the pun-tastic signs. A couple of my favourites this year were Gertrude\u2019s Steins, Bitsy\u2019s Bitterbeer, Poem Depot, and the one for Gutenberg\u2019s adult bookstore. There was also an episode in season two that made a big deal out of Dreamland (and Steamland) discovering coffee for the first time... which is funny because there was a shop in the first season named Peat Coffee. Guess it was a different, more mossy recipe?\n\nOtto\u2019s automatons\n\nDuring her visit to Steamland, Bean comes across a steampunk-style robot shop called Otto\u2019s Automatons. This could be a reference to Otto from The Simpsons, but I am curious/hoping if it\u2019s a nod to Otto the Automaton from the Trinyvale Campaign of Not Another D&D Podcast. It\u2019d be a deep cut, like really really deep, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were some artists on the team who were fans of Dungeons & Dragons podcasting. Also, special shout-out to Fry\u2019s hairdo.\n\nElfo\u2019s mum\n\nOne of the bigger underlying mysteries in Disenchantment is: Who is Elfo\u2019s real mum? We previously learned he wasn\u2019t a true 100 per cent elf and speculation has risen to include humans, dwarves, maybe even some kind of unknown monster. But the biggest hint we got so far points in one direction: the ogres.\n\nIn \u201cOur Bodies, Our Elves,\u201d Bean and Elfo travel to ogre territory in search of a magical fruit that can cure any illness \u2014 based on a recommendation from Elfo\u2019s dad, who not-so-subtly hinted that he had some \u201cgood times\u201d during one of his ventures there. They come across the ogre queen, who helps them gather the berries and escape before they\u2019re killed. And just as Elfo is leaving, the ogre queen hears his name... and recognises it.\n\nDoes this mean Elfo\u2019s mum is queen of the ogres or perhaps she knows who Elfo\u2019s mum actually is? It\u2019s one of many mysteries left for another day.\n\nDisenchantment Parts 1 and 2 are currently available on Netflix. It\u2019s already been renewed for another two-part season.", "description": "Disenchantment is a different type of Matt Groening show.
