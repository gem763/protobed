The Kennedy Center\u2019s new Reach complex was built atop the DC Water shaft, which is part of the Clean Rivers Project to prevent sewage from flowing into the Potomac. (DC Water)\n\nColumnist\n\nIn the right light, the smooth concrete buildings of the Kennedy Center\u2019s new Reach complex resemble gleaming white icebergs. And, as with icebergs, there\u2019s a lot going on below the surface. You wouldn\u2019t know it by looking at it, but before a single performance or practice space could be built, a massive piece of sewer infrastructure \u2014 a concrete-lined shaft as big as two grain silos stacked atop one another \u2014 was constructed underneath the Reach.\n\nJust as the Reach will contribute to the cultural health of the city, so this shaft will contribute to the actual health of the Potomac and the Chesapeake. It\u2019s designed to keep poop from flowing into the river.\n\nA sewer pipe has emerged into the river just west of the Kennedy Center since before there was a Kennedy Center. It\u2019s called Combined Sewer Overflow Outfall No. 21 and is part of an antiquated system that, during storms, causes rainwater to mix with sewage. The foul brew is then discharged into the Potomac. As part of its $2.7 billion Clean Rivers Project, DC Water has been methodically working to separate those two things, with pipes for storm water and pipes for sewage.\n\nAddressing CSO 21 has been on the books for years. DC Water was planning to dig the shaft about five years from now. But when the Kennedy Center announced it was planning to build the Reach, the utility basically said: Okay, but it\u2019s probably a good idea if we build our thing before you build your thing. That way, we won\u2019t have to sink a sewage shaft next to your ballet dancers.\n\nThe concrete-lined shaft \u2014 23 feet in diameter and 100 feet deep \u2014 is just east of the Reach\u2019s River Pavilion, underneath a grove of ginkgo trees. Eventually, the bottom of the shaft will be connected to a tunnel that will take sewage to the treatment plant at Blue Plains, from whence it will emerge \u201clooking almost like Colorado mountain spring water,\u201d said Carlton Ray, director of DC Water\u2019s Clean Rivers Project.\n\nAlso constructed under the Reach as part of the project: a ventilation control facility. Air will be pulled through the tunnel and passed through granular carbon filters. \u201cWe want to make sure we don\u2019t have any kind of odors ever generated from the facility,\u201d Ray said.\n\n\n\nA sign on the banks of the Potomac River near the Kennedy Center\u2019s new Reach complex indicates where a sewer pipe emerges into the river. Before the Reach was built, DC Water constructed a deep shaft that will divert sewage to Blue Plains. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nThe two projects were very different. DC Water\u2019s sturdy sewer pipes cost $34 million. The swooping Reach cost $250 million. But they have something in common. Both are made primarily of the same material: concrete.\n\n\u201cObviously we\u2019re much more meat and potatoes,\u201d Ray said. \u201cWe\u2019re the concrete that you would see on a bridge, versus the beautiful work that\u2019s done on the Reach. That\u2019s magnificent concrete.\u201d\n\nHey, don\u2019t sell yourself short, Carlton.\n\nThe Kennedy Center\u2019s senior vice president of operations, Ellery J. Brown, said the shaft may be utilitarian, but the two projects \u2014 the concrete Reach above the concrete sewer \u2014 perform \u201ca nice little handshake.\u201d\n\nYour name here\n\n\n\nFor now, donor names at the Kennedy Center\u2019s new Reach complex are formed by adhesive letters. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Reach \u2014 designed by architect Steven Holl \u2014 is pretty cool. I haven\u2019t seen a performance there yet, but architecture is like a performance and just admiring it can stir the soul.\n\nThere was one unusual thing I noticed on my visit: the marble interior wall that\u2019s covered with the names of benefactors. Donors are typically thanked by having their names chiseled in stone. But these names are made from adhesive letters that have been stuck on the wall.\n\nIs that a new way of doing things?\n\nNo, said the Kennedy Center. The adhesive letters are temporary.\n\nDonations were still coming in as of August. \u201cUsing temporary decals allowed us to recognize as many of our leadership donors as possible at the Sept. 7 opening,\u201d wrote a spokesperson in an email.\n\nThe official engraving is slated to begin in January.\n\nSmoke on the water\n\nCathy Strickler of Fredericksburg, Va., attended some of the Reach\u2019s opening festivities with her husband, Charlie. Experiencing live performances outside on a warm summer evening \u2014 the jets landing at National \u2014 reminded her of another alfresco experience: being in the audience at the Water Gate.\n\nThose are the steps west of the Lincoln Memorial where people would sit while an orchestra performed on a barge. The concerts lasted from 1935 to 1965. The steps gave their name to a building complex that, in turn, gave its name to a political scandal.\n\n\u201cThis new venue certainly recreates the ambiance that I remember so fondly,\u201d wrote Cathy.\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "Brothers in concrete: The new shaft will help keep sewage out of the Potomac.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vHsrLz_1YQ5_GEDWf-XURPdvgUI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y3D4DBWJVMI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
