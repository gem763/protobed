So, yeah, that's the best I could do.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s album artwork has drawn intense criticism and has even come under scrutiny for its religious connotations and suggestions of knife crimes and beheadings. The artwork has even been outlawed by some streaming platforms overseas because it insinuates violence.\n\nROBERT HUNTER, GRATEFUL DEAD LYRICIST, DEAD AT 78\n\nHawkins said he expected people to be offended.\n\n\u201cThat's true. I think they will be. And there are people who need to close their laptops and look around at the world,\u201d he maintains, adding that the work was never intended to spark such a response and simply saying it\u2019s all relative to the overall tone and message of the album.\n\nYahoo Music\u2019s Lyndsey Parker describes the project as a \u201ccomplex concept album loosely built around the idea that in a parallel universe, Jesus avoided his crucifixion,\u201d adding that even the album\u2019s media release bills it as a \u201cparable\u201d about the \u201cslow death and eventual glorious rebirth of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll,\u201d and a \u201cliterally Biblical record\u201d aimed at \u201cthose who have said that rock \u2018n\u2019 roll is the Devil\u2019s music\u2026 [they] should listen and understand that it is, in truth, the voice of God.\u201d\n\nBLONDIE SINGER DEBBIE HARRY RECALLS SEX, DRUGS AND ROCK 'N' ROLL IN MEMOIR, COMPARES FAME TO HEROIN\n\nHawkins told the outlet detractors should look for the underlying meanings and said the \u201cscience fiction\u201d element surrounding the idea of their cover art allows the band the creative freedom to play with the biblical content.\n\n\u201cWe're not saying this is what should happen or what did happen. We're saying that if we're allowed multiverse theory, then let's talk about denying the crucifixion and not letting that happen in the first place,\u201d Hawkins explained. I do understand why people are offended by it, but I don't actually apologize for it, because I don't think it's blasphemous to ask a question like that.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nAdded the lead man: \u201cWhat if there is a universe like that? Because obviously if the good Lord creator \u2014 the design fellow up there with his beard and all that \u2014 if He created one universe, and we're now saying that He's created an infinite number of universes, so that every possible outcome of every decision that everybody's ever made since the beginning of time is even better, and in one of those, there\u2019s a son that has been sent to save us all, then I think that's a beautiful thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cEaster is Cancelled\u201d was released on Sept. 26.", "description": "Justin Hawkins of the British rock group the Darkness isn\u2019t apologizing to anyone offended by the provocative album cover for their latest release, \u201cEaster is Cancelled.\u201d", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-494524622.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
