He just so happens to be 5 feet, 6 inches tall.\n\nGerrit Cole (right) celebrates with the ALCS trophy Saturday night.

And Didi Gregorius was so close to hitting a three-run homer in Game 3. But they just couldn\u2019t seem to get that timely hit when it mattered most (DJ LeMahieu notwithstanding).\n\nRegardless, this marks the third straight postseason that the Yankees were eliminated by a superior team with superior starting pitching.\n\nAnd that\u2019s really what it comes down to.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the 2017 ALCS, it was Justin Verlander (16 innings, one run). In the 2018 ALDS, it was Chris Sale (Game 1 win as a starter and Game 4 hold as a setup man). And in the 2019 ALCS, it was Gerrit Cole (seven shutout innings in Game 3).\n\nThat\u2019s how the Yankees go 0-3 and lose to two \u2014 or shortly, maybe three \u2014 championship teams.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how the Astros (Cole, Verlander, Zack Greinke) end up facing the Washington Nationals (Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg, Patrick Corbin) for the right to hoist baseball\u2019s ultimate prize.\n\nAll of which goes to say that the Bronx Bombers need to do everything in their power to land Gerrit Cole on a massive deal in free agency.\n\nInconsistent rotation and overtaxed bullpen cost Yankees in ALCS\n\nMaybe it costs eight years, $240 million.\n\nMaybe it starts with Cole getting $120 million over the first three years and an opt-out the following season in case he wants to go to Los Angeles (the California kid may end up going to the Dodgers or Angels this winter, anyway).\n\nWhatever the cost, the Yankees need to get it done.\n\nBecause they failed to reach the World Series this decade \u2014 the first time that\u2019s happened since the 1910s.\n\nAnd that needs to change.\n\nThe Yankees don\u2019t like making massive, long-term investments on starting pitching \u2014 with CC Sabathia (seven years, $161 million) and Masahiro Tanaka (seven years, $155 million) being their most recent exceptions.\n\nThose types of moves can hurt down the line, as pitchers age, become more injury-prone, and their production declines.\n\nIn his last 25 starts, Gerrit Cole is 19-0 with a 1.59 ERA, posting 258 strikeouts in 169 1/3 innings. (Mike Stobe/Getty Images)\n\nBut their hitters keep failing \u2014 as even the best hitters in the most prolific offense tend to \u2014 against superior starting pitching in the postseason.\n\nSo get Cole, while taking him away from your toughest opposition in the process. In his last 25 starts, the 29-year-old righty is 19-0 with a 1.59 ERA, posting 258 strikeouts in 169 1/3 innings.\n\nThe rival Boston Red Sox are about to enter retooling mode. And the Astros may very well lose Cole regardless at the end of the season.\n\nSo the time to take advantage of that is now.\n\nMasahiro Tanaka, James Paxton and Luis Severino all had their moments in the ALCS. Tanaka posted six shutout innings in Game 1, while Paxton notched six innings of one-run ball in Game 5 \u2014 both wins.\n\nBut then there was Paxton recording only seven outs in Game 2; Tanaka\u2019s four-pitch leadoff walk to No. 8 hitter Robinson Chirinos before George Springer\u2019s three-run homer in Game 4; and Severino allegedly tipping his off-speed pitches in the first two innings in Game 3.\n\nThe Yankees didn\u2019t have Domingo German (domestic violence incident) on their ALCS roster. And J.A. Happ\u2019s regular-season struggles prompted them to make him a $17 million bulk man in the bullpen. It all added up to needing to use an opener in Game 6, and Chad Green surrendered a three-run homer to Yuli Gurriel in the first.\n\nThe Yankees wanted to be aggressive with their deep power bullpen \u2014 and they were. But the lack of length from their starters may have caught up to them in the end.\n\nAdam Ottavino struggled throughout the ALCS, while Tommy Kahnle finally faltered in Game 6. And then Altuve delivered the knockout punch with Chapman \u2014 who is eligible to opt-out of his contract \u2014 on the mound.\n\nIt was a strategy that called for perfection. And their relief corps fell short in that respect.\n\nAfter so many misses on starting pitching, the Yankees could use a hit\n\nThe Yankees have missed out on their share of impact starters over the years \u2014 including this one.\n\nThey didn\u2019t want to go six years for Corbin, who went to Washington instead. And then they were outbid by Atlanta for Dallas Keuchel.\n\nThe trade deadline also yielded nothing.\n\nGranted, two pitchers the Yankees really coveted (Noah Syndergaard and Zack Wheeler) play for the other team in town, so that wasn\u2019t happening.\n\nWheeler, a free agent himself, could provide an intriguing alternative to Cole. He\u2019s inconsistent, but has plus stuff and struck out nearly a batter an inning in 2019. There\u2019s a lot of potential upside with him. Strasburg is the other big name that could hit the market if he opts out.\n\nVerlander was a near-miss in 2017, his contract a non-starter for the Steinbrenner family. And Cole, who the Yankees drafted but couldn\u2019t sign in 2008, keeps feeling like the one that got away after the Yankees also were unable to acquire him in 2018. They didn\u2019t want to trade either Gleyber Torres or Miguel Andujar to the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nIn retrospect, they would\u2019ve moved Andujar in a second, but Cole wasn\u2019t the caliber of pitcher he is now, arguably the best pitcher on the planet. Rather, he was coming off a season in which he went 12-12 with a 4.26 ERA and 31 homers allowed.\n\nBrian Cashman and the rest of his front office need to get creative and figure it out. (Mike Stobe/Getty Images)\n\nSo maybe the third time will be the charm.\n\nAnd just imagine if they had gotten Shohei Ohtani \u2014 as they hoped they would (injuries aside) \u2014 instead of turning to Giancarlo Stanton, who still has eight years left on his deal (at Cole money).\n\nOh, what might\u2019ve been.\n\nThe Yankees have a lot of decisions upcoming \u2014 chief among them the futures of Gregorius, Chapman, Brett Gardner, Dellin Betances, Edwin Encarnacion and Austin Romine.\n\nIn any case, Sabathia is retiring and Tanaka is going into the final year of his contract.\n\nThe Yankees simply need to open their coffers and get Gerrit Cole \u2014 even if it means going over the luxury tax and paying more.\n\nYes, several players are going to be due significant arbitration raises (specifically, Judge, Paxton and Gary Sanchez), but GM Brian Cashman and the rest of his front office need to get creative and figure it out.\n\nThey\u2019ve done it before on the position-player side, unearthing diamonds in the rough like Gio Urshela, Mike Tauchman and Mike Ford on the cheap. The pitching side, however, has been a different story.\n\nSabathia and A.J. Burnett proved to be the missing pieces on the 2009 World Series championship team. And Cole could be that missing piece for the 2020 Yankees.\n\nUntil then, the pain will continue to linger.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "In each of the last three postseasons, the Yankees have been eliminated by a superior team with superior starting pitching.
