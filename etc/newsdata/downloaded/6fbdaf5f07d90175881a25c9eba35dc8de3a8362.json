Jake Tapper asked Buttigieg if he believed Clinton\u2019s claim to which Buttigieg replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the basis is for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t either,\u201d Tapper said.\n\nButtigieg could have really dropped the hammer on Clinton here but he\u2019s clearly in campaign mode and trying to avoid giving offense to someone who a lot of Democrats still admire. So he gave a bland answer about Gabbard being a competitor who should be confronted in terms of policy differences.\n\nAt that point, Tapper pushed back a little. He doesn\u2019t single out Buttigieg. Instead, he generalized the question to include all Democratic candidates: \u201cSo when Donald Trump smears people, Democrats all stand up and say \u2018You\u2019re smearing someone, stop it.\u2019 Why don\u2019t Democrats\u2026say that about Tulsi Gabbard?\u201d He added, \u201cIt seems like an obvious smear. I don\u2019t see any evidence she\u2019s a Russian asset. It seems like a wild accusation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think statements like that ought to be backed by evidence,\u201d Buttigieg said before changing the subject to Donald Trump and Republicans.\n\nTapper let him run through his answer and then concluded the segment by calling it \u201can agile pivot.\u201d That\u2019s what it was. Buttigieg was given at least three chances to call out Hillary Clinton and he sidestepped them all. In fact, Buttigieg never used Hillary\u2019s name in the entire segment.\n\nThe Washington Post pointed out Saturday that Cory Booker actually defended Clinton while other Democrats were making similar pivots to avoid the issue:\n\nFew outside Clinton\u2019s immediate orbit defended her comments. The closest anyone came was Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who retweeted Gabbard\u2019s reaction to Clinton with a viral GIF from the June debate when he glanced \u201cside eyed\u201d \u2014 a look that often conveys shock or disdain \u2014 at another candidate. That garnered a reply from Clinton \u2014 a viral GIF of her own from a 2016 debate where she exhales, says, \u201cokay,\u201d smiles and shimmies her shoulders. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, whose Iowa bus tour had been overshadowed by the Gabbard-Clinton fight, told reporters on Friday that Clinton could \u201cdefend herself, and will.\u201d Asked about the story again on Saturday, she pivoted to talk about her election integrity legislation\u2026\n\nHere\u2019s Booker\u2019s tweet casting side-eye at Gabbard:\n\nAndrew Yang stood out from the crowd by offering some criticism on Twitter though he also didn\u2019t use Hillary\u2019s name:\n\nTulsi Gabbard deserves much more respect and thanks than this. She literally just got back from serving our country abroad. \u2014 Andrew Yang\ud83e\udde2 (@AndrewYang) October 19, 2019\n\nMaybe all of this is a sign that Hillary still has some juice in the party. She\u2019ll be endorsing someone eventually. Buttigieg and the others probably don\u2019t want to spoil their chances by getting on her bad side now. Whatever the reason, it\u2019s notable that Clinton can level such a wild accusation and no one seems willing to directly contradict her. In fact, given how wild the accusation is, it\u2019s pretty noteworthy that the media as a whole doesn\u2019t seem to be making very much of it.\n\nOne more clip. Van Jones not only named Hillary but said she was \u201cplaying a dangerous game\u201d and \u201cplaying right into the Russian\u2019s hands.\u201d", "description": "She who must not be named.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Buttigieg-Tapper.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
