But eagle-eyed fans had already memorized it, and started to FaceTime her.\n\nShe then posted a video of her picking up one of FaceTime calls.\n\n\"Oh my god people are FaceTiming me,\" she wrote. \"Was 100% sure this would be a penis but nope just a nice stranger.\"\n\nOn the other end of the line was a fan called Ricardo. Teigen spoke with him for a while with her mother Vilailuck Teigen.\n\n\"Hi Ricardo, nice to meet you,\" she said. \"This is my mom. Thanks for calling me.\"\n\nWhen Ricardo asked how they were, Teigen said \"we're good, we're about to eat dinner but thought we'd answer one of these.\"\n\nRead more: Trump complains that Chrissy Teigen and John Legend are stealing all his credit for new criminal justice reforms\n\nTeigen posted three more videos of her covering her face in despair and laughing while her FaceTime kept ringing and ringing. One is captioned \"please stop I have a family.\"\n\nLess than an hour later she had enough and tweeted that she had disabled everything and changed her email address.\n\n\"But I love you guys and thank you for the kind words lol,\" she said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Teigen has messed up and posted her contact information somewhere fans could see it. Back in 2016, after her cookbook \"Cravings\" was released, she received hundreds of random phone calls.\n\nAs it turned out, a photo on one of the pages featured Teigen's husband John Legend and their dog Pippa, who was wearing a collar with a phone number and the words \"Call if lost.\"\n\n\"Early purchasers of my cookbook were gifted with my tiiiiiny phone number on Pippa's collar on page 111,\" Teigen later tweeted. \"Learned this after 100 or so calls!\"\n\nShe said she had since changed her number, but thanked fans \"for all the kind voicemails!\"\n\nRead more: 28 celebrities who are real-life heroes", "description": "Teigen actually posted a video of her picking up one of the calls, saying: \"Was 100% sure this would be a penis but nope just a nice stranger.\"", "authors": ["Lindsay Dodgson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d81fc8ff4fc2426bf463c25-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
