She set herself up on Youtube.\n\nCable TV is clearly dying. Even an 81-year-old monarch knew it back in 2007!\n\nThose who saw this coming early on made fortunes...\n\nIf you invested in Netflix (NASDAQ: ) back in 2002, today you would be sitting on 24,604% gains.\n\nNetflix\n\nBut the party is over for Netflix.\n\nHave you looked around at the streaming industry lately? It\u2019s like a crowded bar fight.\n\nOn November 1, Apple (NASDAQ: ) launches its own streaming service called Apple TV Plus.\n\nJust five days later, Netflix\u2019s fiercest rival Walt Disney (NYSE: ) launches Disney+. ( You can find my investment case for Disney here .)\n\nNext year, TimeWarner is going live with HBO Max and NBC with Peacock.\n\nThere\u2019s also Amazon (NASDAQ: ) with its widely popular Prime Video and many more.\n\nSee what\u2019s happening?\n\nThe world\u2019s richest and most powerful companies are invading the \u201cstreaming\u201d market that Netflix enjoyed a near-monopoly on for years.\n\nIf you read RiskHedge, you know I\u2019ve been warning to keep money out of stock market darling Netflix (NFLX).\n\nThis was not a popular thing to say when I first wrote it in July last year.\n\nBut Netflix\u2019s worst nightmare has, in fact, come true, and the stock has been almost cut in half.\n\nAn \u201cInvisible\u201d Player in This Industry That Streamers Rely On\n\nThere\u2019s, however, an \u201cinvisible\u201d company playing a key role in this hundred-billion dollar industry.\n\nYou probably use its service\u2026 maybe even without realizing it.\n\nIt\u2019s being watched 3X more than Netflix. And it\u2019s starting to rake in hundreds of millions as the TV revolution enters a new phase.\n\nThe best thing, it\u2019s not competing with Netflix, Amazon Prime Video or any other streaming service.\n\nInstead, video streamers rely on this company\u2014and even pay a cut to it!\n\nMany Folks Need More Than a Subscription to Watch Netflix\n\nAs you probably know, computers are powered by operating systems like Microsoft\u2019s Windows.\n\nThey support the computer\u2019s basic functions and allow you to perform tasks like writing a document or surfing the internet.\n\nWhat you might not know is, these days, TVs need advanced operating systems too. They run in the background, and most folks don\u2019t know they\u2019re there.\n\nBut they\u2019re very important. Without an operating system, your TV couldn\u2019t connect to the internet\u2026 which means it couldn\u2019t access Netflix, Hulu, or any other streaming service.\n\nYou Probably Know Roku For Its Streaming Boxes\n\nWhen most people think of Roku, they think about the physical box wired up to a TV.\n\nFor 17 years, Roku had been in the hardware business. It was the leading provider of physical streaming boxes. 41 million American households now own a Roku device.\n\nBut Roku\u2019s business wasn\u2019t flourishing. In fact, for years the company bled money. Until very recently, the stock went basically nowhere.\n\nThen everything changed.\n\nHere\u2019s Roku\u2019s stock chart since last December:\n\nRoku\n\nAs you can see, it handed out 234% profits in less than a year!\n\nRokus\u2019 management turned its business model upside down. Instead of manufacturing TV streaming boxes, it decided to put its software in TVs and license it.\n\nThe \u201cWindows\u201d of TV\n\nI mentioned Windows earlier\u2026\n\nBack in 1985, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) created Windows, the first (and still by far the most popular) operating system for computers. 77% of all desktop computers run on Windows today, according to Statista.\n\nIt was a turning point for the company. Since Windows\u2019 introduction, Microsoft has surged 144,000%.\n\nToday, Microsoft is the world\u2019s biggest public company!\n\nWhile licensing software may sound boring, as you can see, it\u2019s a very lucrative business.\n\nNow Roku is building an operating system for TVs and licensing it to TV manufacturers.\n\nThis is the part of its business that\u2019s EXPLODING and shows little sign of slowing down\u2026\n\nRoku is Already the #1 OS For TVs\n\nThere are five main TV operating systems: Android TV, webOS, Tizen, Roku TV and SmartCast.\n\nThe biggest TV manufacturers like Sony, LG, and Samsung all use one of these five.\n\nRoku is now leading the TV streaming market, leaving even tech giants Google, Amazon, and Microsoft in the dust:\n\nThe Streamers\n\nNow 1 in 3 smart TVs sold in the US contains Roku technology. That makes it the best-selling TV operating system in the country.\n\nBut while licensing software to TV manufacturers is a lucrative business, it is not where Roku\u2019s biggest money-making opportunity is\u2026\n\nRoku is in the Most Profitable Business\n\nDo you know what some of the biggest tech companies on earth have in common?\n\nThey are all in the business of advertising.\n\nGoogle runs the #1 search engine on the planet. But it earns most of its money from selling ads.\n\nFacebook runs the #1 social network. But again, it earns most of its money from selling ads.\n\nAmazon runs the #1 e-commerce store\u2026 yet advertising is one of Amazon\u2019s most lucrative businesses.\n\nRoku is now in tens of millions of TVs, and that number is growing. And while its user base is one-fifth of Netflix\u2019s, its daily average watch-time per user beats Netflix\u2019s by 3X.\n\nSuch an engaged audience is a dream come true to any advertiser.\n\nRoku now set its sights on building a next-generation TV advertising platform. And it\u2019s already paying off.\n\nRoku\u2019s advertising revenue is rocketing, as you can see below:\n\nRoku Ad Revenue\n\nAnd last year, for the first time, the company made more money from advertising and licensing than its device sales.\n\nHow to Play Roku\u2019s Roller Coaster\n\nGetting in early on geyser-like stocks is alluring. But you have to be careful with Roku...\n\nIt has been on a wild run this year.\n\nAs I mentioned, earlier this year, the stock leapt 450%. This month, however, it has taken a breather and slipped 35%.\n\nMost of it is emotional selling, which is practically impossible to predict.\n\nRoku shows huge promise. In time, I could see it doubling or even tripling from here.\n\nBut if you\u2019re a buyer, know what you\u2019re getting into. It\u2019s still a small and very volatile stock.\n\nThe upside is big\u2026 but along the way, Roku will likely continue to dole out big, quick drops.\n\nMy suggestion: consider taking a small position today... but keep it small enough so that a 30% to 40% drop won\u2019t hurt too much.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Stephen McBride covering: Microsoft Corporation, Walt Disney Company, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc.
