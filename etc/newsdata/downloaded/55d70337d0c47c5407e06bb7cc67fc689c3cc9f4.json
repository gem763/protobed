Rebecca Judd has revealed her secret rivalry with Sarah Jessica Parker (pictured) over a 'bloody makeup artist'\n\n'That makes me feel better,' replied Sarah, realising that the makeup artist she had 'found' on Instagram was in fact an in-demand professional.\n\nMeanwhile, it's been a busy week for Sarah, who is in Australia promoting her SJP shoe collection, which is available at David Jones.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 54-year-old actress told the Herald Sun that some overzealous fans had 'freaked her out' by trying to touch her at the airport.\n\n'I haven't been able to get her!' While interviewing Sarah on The 3pm Pick-Up, Rebecca (above) saw red when she spotted the actress using her favourite makeup artist in the studio\n\n'The world is scary a little bit right now, there's a heightened awareness, there's tension, so the only thing that freaks me out is people grabbing me,' she said.\n\n'I much prefer conversation to a selfie.'\n\nSarah added: 'What's happening now is that people actually grab you, people want a selfie, so there's no exchange of, \"Hello, how are you? Do you mind for a moment if we do a photograph?\" It's, \"Can we do a selfie?\"'\n\nCentre of attention: It's been a busy week for Sarah, who is in Australia promoting her SJP shoe collection, which is available at David Jones\n\nIt comes after Sarah shared her mind-blowing theory that her Sex and the City character, writer Carrie Bradshaw, had simply imagined her trio of girlfriends.\n\nShe told News.com.au: 'Think about it: did Carrie make them up? She's telling a story every week. This is her point of view, it's almost always her point of view.'\n\nRegardless of whether they were figments of Carrie's imagination, the group of friends on Sex and the City have become iconic in their own right.", "description": "While interviewing\u00a0the Sex and the City star on The 3pm Pick-Up,\u00a0Rebecca saw red when she spotted\u00a0Sarah using her favourite makeup artist in the studio", "authors": ["Shannon Shipley For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/01/20110454-0-image-a-24_1571877497909.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
