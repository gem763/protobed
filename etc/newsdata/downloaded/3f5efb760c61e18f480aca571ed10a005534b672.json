As of 2018, just 1% of borrowers who applied for the program had been accepted.\n\nAt a Congressional hearing, Jeff Appel, director of policy liaison and implementation in the department\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid, said the low approval rate was because of the program\u2019s complexity \u2014 not to mention the fact that about 80% of forgiveness applicants still haven\u2019t made the required 10 years of repayments to become eligible.\n\n\u201cNaturally, as time progresses, more borrowers will have a real opportunity to meet the criteria,\u201d he said.\n\nTo get their balance wiped away in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, borrowers need to make 120 repayments and show they have been working are in an eligible public sector profession during that time. Nonprofit employees and nurses are some of the people who, technically at least, get clean slates.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: How wiping out $1.5 trillion in student debt would boost the economy\n\nIt all \u201cseems simple,\u201d Appel said. But there are twists. Only one sort of federal loan, a Direct Loan, being available for discharge. About two-thirds of borrowers had different types of loans when lawmakers enacted the program in 2007, he noted.\n\nAs of June, 1,526 borrowers have wiped away their debts for a total $80.2 million under the program and a supplemental program, according to him. That\u2019s out of more than 100,000 who applied.\n\nAppel said the department agreed with Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommendations to better explain the rules to applicants and loan servicers. The watchdog office made the recommendations last year. The Education Department hasn\u2019t put them fully into effect, according to the GAO.\n\nThe Education Department can do \u2018a better job of explaining those complicated requirements to borrowers.\u2019 \u2014Jeff Appel, Education Department official\n\nThe Education Department can\u2019t re-write eligibility rules, Appel said. But it can do \u201ca better job of explaining those complicated requirements to borrowers,\u201d he said. The department posted a loan forgiveness help tool late last year, which has now been used over 200,000 times.\n\nAppel \u2014 and many Republican lawmakers at the hearing \u2014 said slim discharge rates boiled down to faithfully following the letter of a complex law.\n\nDemocrats and advocates see it differently. A 99% rejection showed a failing program, said Rep. Bobby Scott, a Democrat from Virginia. \u201cThese aren\u2019t puzzles or contests, these are programs you\u2019re supposed to benefit from,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo months before Appel\u2019s remarks, the American Federation of Teachers sued the Department of Education, alleging \u201cgross mismanagement.\u201d The federal lawsuit listed examples of teachers who talked to their servicers and thought they were making all the right payments for 10 years \u2014 but were then rejected and told to start all over again.\n\n\u2018I have to resign myself that I\u2019m going to die with this debt. That\u2019s my reality. That\u2019s what I accept. However, if a program was designed to protect me, I have to protect myself.\u2019 \u2014Kelly Finlaw, a middle school art teacher owing almost $100,000 in student loans\n\nKelly Finlaw, one of the lawsuit\u2019s plaintiffs, testified Thursday. The New York City middle school art teacher with an almost $100,000 balance said she never went into education hoping the government would pay her loans.\n\n\u201cI have to resign myself that I\u2019m going to die with this debt. That\u2019s my reality. That\u2019s what I accept. However, if a program was designed to protect me, I have to protect myself,\u201d she said.\n\nShe didn\u2019t buy the idea the 99% rate was all because of complexity. \u201cI was lied to several times, Directly lied to,\u201d she said.\n\nLike a crusade\n\nSome of the lucky few borrowers who have wiped away their debts in the program said they needed plenty of time and energy for calls and paperwork. One successful applicant previously told MarketWatch that working on her forgiveness claim became a personal \u201ccrusade.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Matthew Chingos, the Urban Institute\u2019s vice president for education data and policy, said the largest benefits aren\u2019t going to the applicants who need them the most, but the borrowers with the time and savvy \u201cto navigate the system.\u201d\n\nOne loan servicer skipped the hearing\n\nThe Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency processes all public service loan forgiveness applications through its FedLoan servicing operation. The organization is fighting off lawsuits alleging it botched the program, including one case filed by the Massachusetts Attorney General\u2019s office.\n\nPennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency\u2019s CEO declined an invitation to testify, according to a \u201cdisappointed\u201d Rep. Susan Davis, a Democrat from California. The federal government has paid Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency $1.3 billion for its contract to handle the applications, she noted.\n\nRep. Lloyd Smucker, a Republican from Pennsylvania, noted the Democrats invited a lawyer from the Massachusetts Attorney General\u2019s to testify. The Democrats \u201cshamefully decided to make a spectacle,\u201d he claimed.\n\nA Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA) spokesman told MarketWatch the organization only received an invitation a week ago.\n\n\u201cHowever, PHEAA\u2019s very limited ability to speak on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education, which administers and controls the PSLF Program, prevented the agency from participating,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs a public service organization, PHEAA is committed to quality servicing and successful outcomes for all borrowers. We have and will continue to collaborate with Congress and the Department, seeking substantive improvements on behalf of borrowers. A thoughtful, solution-based conversation among all parties is what we seek and is what all borrowers deserve,\u201d the spokesman said.", "description": "The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program is designed to wipe away student-loan debt for people who work in public-service jobs.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GG783_Betsy__ZG_20180404161251.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
