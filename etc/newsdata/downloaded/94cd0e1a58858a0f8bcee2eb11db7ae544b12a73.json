Depending on who you ask internally, the process has been painful or helpful, disruptive or necessary.\n\nBy \"bringing these three companies together, we're creating something really really powerful together that could not have been done otherwise,\" Stephenson said. \"The idea that you can stand up a product, HBO Max, that requires in-depth integration of HBO, Warner Bros and Turner, not to mention Otter Media, which is a big part of this as well -- man, a lot of people said it couldn't be done. This is exciting.\"\n\nAT&T said Monday that it intends to spend about $2 billion on HBO Max in the next two years.\n\nThe company's stated goal is to sign up 50 million subscribers by 2025, five years into the service's launch.\n\nAT&T has more than 170 million customers across its wireless, telephone, broadband, and television businesses. Those customers will be seeing extensive promotions for HBO Max in the coming months.\n\nHBO already offers a streaming subscription option for its programming, known as HBO Now.\n\nBut HBO Max will have a much fuller library of TV shows and films -- more than 10,000 hours of programming.\n\nIt is a more direct challenge to the likes of Netflix, though industry experts emphasize that the so-called \"streaming wars\" are not a zero-sum game, since many households sign up for multiple such services.\n\nNetflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu have a huge head start. On Friday Apple is introducing a subscription bundle of shows called Apple TV+. And in mid-November Disney is entering the space with Disney+.\n\nTuesday's event will give WarnerMedia an opportunity to present its vision and plan. Dozens of deals for TV dramas, sitcoms, films, documentaries, and other programming have been announced in recent months. And plans for further programming will be unveiled on Tuesday.\n\n\"The Max part of it is new original programming to broaden it out from kids to adults,\" WarnerMedia Entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt said at a conference earlier this month.\n\nPast hits like \"Friends\" and \"The West Wing\" will also be available, in some cases because they're being pulled off of Netflix.", "description": "AT&T is about to introduce the world to HBO Max.", "authors": ["Brian Stelter", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191028133403-hbo-max---stock-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
