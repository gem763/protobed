But he remains active with programs at the post-presidency center he and Rosalynn Carter opened in Atlanta in 1982. He still teaches Sunday School at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains. The Carters plan to travel later this week to Nashville, Tennessee, where they will help build houses for Habitat for Humanity.\n\nCarter survived a dire cancer diagnosis in 2015 and became the longest-lived U.S. president in history this spring, surpassing George H.W. Bush, who died in 2018. Rosalynn Carter, now 92, is among the longest-lived first ladies. The couple has been married for 73 years.\n\nIn recent public appearances, the former president has sounded like a man still intent on securing his legacy, amplifying his criticisms of American military spending and war, blasting the proliferation of money in U.S. politics and urging action to combat the climate crisis. And he\u2019s expressed particular pride that the U.S. engaged in no foreign wars during his tenure.\n\n\u201cI just want to keep the whole world at peace,\u201d Carter said in September during his annual Carter Center report.\n\n\u201cWe have been at war more than 226 years. We have been at peace for about 16 years,\u201d he said of the U.S. since the Declaration of Independence in 1776. He asserted that every U.S. military conflict from the Korean War onward has been a war of \u201cchoice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States is very deeply inclined to go to war,\u201d Carter said, partly as \u201ca mechanism by which we can implant American policies \u2026 in other countries.\u201d A Naval Academy graduate and World War II veteran, Carter said presidents feed the cycle, in part because \u201cwe make a hero\u201d out of wartime commanders-in-chief.\n\nThe Carter Center, which has focused mainly on public health, election monitoring and conflict resolution, has \u201cnever voiced an opinion publicly\u201d on individual wars, Carter noted.\n\n\u201cThis is primarily my fault,\u201d the former president said, explaining that he wants the center to become a more forceful advocate on questions of war around the world, including \u201cwars by the United States.\u201d He said the Carter Center could engage in \u201cconstructive criticism of the United States government \u2026 without being partisan about it.\u201d\n\nAn outspoken Christian, Carter sometimes frames his views on war in terms of his faith, noting that Jesus is referred to in the Bible as the \u201cprince of peace.\u201d But at the Carter Center in September and a day later in his town hall with Emory University freshmen, the former president emphasized economic consequences of war.\n\nChina, he noted, has \u201cbeen at peace\u201d since he normalized relations with Beijing in 1979. Since then, Carter said, the U.S. has spent trillions on military conflict, while China has invested similar amounts in high-speed rail, new college campuses and other infrastructure. He told Emory freshmen he\u2019s not \u201cfavorably\u201d comparing China\u2019s human rights record, but rather emphasizing the costs of war.\n\nCarter hasn\u2019t backed anyone in the Democratic presidential primaries, even as some candidates call on the former president. But he says re-electing President Donald Trump would be \u201ca disaster.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that he voted for Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist, over the establishment favorite Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary. This time, Carter cautions Democrats not to go too far left, warning that an embrace of single-payer, government-run health insurance could cost the party votes among moderates and independents. That would seem to rule out Sanders and another progressive favorite, Elizabeth Warren.\n\nBut Carter said he would like to see a woman as president, and made a notable observation on age, saying he couldn\u2019t have managed \u201cthe duties I experienced when I was president\u201d when he was 80 years old. That could be seen to nix not only Sanders, at 78, but the more moderate former Vice President Joe Biden, who is 76. Warren is 70.\n\nTwo longshot candidates who apparently fit Carter\u2019s stated priorities for the party are Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, a 37-year-old who was born after Carter\u2019s presidency ended, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a moderate who is close to Carter\u2019s vice president and fellow Minnesotan, Walter Mondale. Both have visited Carter since declaring their candidacies.\n\nCarter has given no indication that he will endorse, making clear only that he\u2019ll be \u201cvoting Democratic\u201d in the general election.\n\nWhile he matter-of-factly declares his intentions to vote next fall, Carter also talks with the realism of a nonagenarian, born when the world population was quarter of what it is today and the life expectancy of American males was 58 years.\n\nHe noted he\u2019s often said he wanted to live long enough to announce the end of Guinea worm disease, a parasitic infection attributed to poor drinking water. There were 3.5 million cases in 21 countries in 1986, when the Carter Center began its eradication program. In 2018, there were 28 cases worldwide.\n\nA year later, Carter expresses disappointment over an outbreak of the disease among dogs, with new human cases in Chad, Angola and Cameroon. Researchers from multiple universities, he said, are \u201ctrying to figure out what to do about it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the former president told a rapt Carter Center audience that they might have heard his final annual report, because he plans to start devoting more time to his family.\n\n\u201cThis may be our last conversation with you,\u201d Carter said. \u201cWe may or may not have one next year.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jimmy Carter is celebrating his 95th birthday, becoming the first U.S. president to reach that milestone as he continues his humanitarian work and occasionally wades back into politics and policy debates almost four decades after leaving office.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bill Barrow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/jimmy_carter_birthday_42493_c0-226-2400-1625_s1770x1032.jpg?555515249edbd90bda00a9605b75ccfa8187909b", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
