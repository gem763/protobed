The more fundamental issue of Canada\u2019s economic competitiveness has been all but ignored, despite the fact that a competitive economy is what creates well-paying jobs and provides the wherewithal to address issues voters care deeply about, such as affordability.\n\nThe troubling fact of the matter is that the Canadian economy is becoming less competitive on the world stage. The World Economic Forum recently published its Global Competitiveness Report for 2019 and Canada has dropped two spots to 14th place. This is not surprising news: most other competitiveness indexes display a similar trend. To cite just one, the World Bank\u2019s \u201cEase of Doing Business\u201d shows Canada dropping from fourth place in 2006 all the way to 22nd in 2019.\n\nThis upsetting development aligns with the core findings of the \u201cCompetitiveness Scorecard\u201d we at Deloitte released earlier this year. We looked at eight dimensions on which Canada\u2019s economy competes and ranked our country\u2019s performance on each relative to its international peers. The areas where Canada is weakest included infrastructure, innovation, taxation and regulation.\n\nRegulation is not a topic that musters much enthusiasm among voters. And there have been many government initiatives to reduce red tape in the past. But it needs to be stressed that Canada\u2019s regulatory environment is hampering economic prosperity.\n\nIn January, the Business Council of Canada surveyed the country\u2019s top business leaders to get their views on the economy. Forty-one per cent identified reduction of regulatory burden as the \u201cone thing to improve Canada\u2019s business environment.\u201d When asked which regulatory issue represented the most significant problem for their company, a majority of respondents listed uncertainty and/or a lack of predictability in regulatory processes. This was followed by the time it takes to make a decision and regulatory inconsistencies between different parts of the country.\n\nDrilling deeper on the World Economic Forum\u2019s latest evaluation of Canada\u2019s performance, though we rank 14th for overall competitiveness we\u2019re 38th in terms of government regulation, 23rd on the efficiency of our legal system for challenging regulations and 26th on government policy stability. Many observers argue we need newer, more flexible regulations to unlock the potential of the latest technologies that are disrupting business models. Yet on government responsiveness to change \u2014 despite all the talk about change in the recent leaders\u2019 debates \u2014 we rank 37th, while in terms of our legal framework\u2019s adaptability to digital business models we are 27th.\n\nThe reality is that Canada\u2019s regulatory environment is fraught with duplication, jurisdictional overlap, and misalignment, both across provinces and with our major trading partners. Navigating regulatory requirements costs businesses excessive amounts of time and money. And as we have heard repeatedly over the past few weeks, it has become very difficult to get major infrastructure projects approved and completed owing to regulatory barriers and burdens.\n\nAll levels of government need to be part of the solution. They all need to make regulatory reform a priority. Out-dated, unnecessary regulations should be identified and eliminated. Governments should work hard to harmonize with each other and with global peers. New and creative approaches to regulation are needed to unlock the potential of new technology. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data analytical tools obviously run on data, but regulations related to the handling of data were set in eras when such technology did not exist. AI tools can be applied to regulatory reform but only if data policy allows their application across government departments and ministries. Regulatory \u201csandboxes\u201d are another creative approach to reform in which relaxing existing regulations encourages assessment of what new approaches could be taken and what their benefits might be.\n\nCanada needs to change paths. The call to action is not for deregulation. In many areas, we do need regulations to ensure markets generate the outcomes Canadians want and deserve. But our goal should be to achieve the public interest at the least economic cost. Canada is far from that ideal today. No country has created an optimal regulatory regime, but if we could make significant progress on regulatory reform, we could make regulation a competitive advantage in support of stronger and more sustainable economic growth. This may not have been the focus of the federal election but it should be top of mind for the next government.\n\nCraig Alexander is Partner & Chief Economist at Deloitte Canada.", "description": "Our goal should be to achieve the public interest at the least economic cost", "authors": ["Craig Alexander", "Special To Financial Post"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/red-tape.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
