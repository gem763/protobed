Aleksandr Moiseyev said on October 22, according to state news agency Tass. \"Previously these were glaciers, but the melting of ice led to the islands emerging.\"\n\nThe discoveries come as Moscow has boosted its military presence in the region, refurbishing Cold War-era bases, setting up new units, opening ports and runways, and deploying radar and air-defense systems.\n\nIn all, Russia has built 475 military facilities in the Arctic over the past six years and deployed personnel, special weapons, and equipment to them, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said in March.\n\nUS officials regard Russian activity in the Arctic as \"aggressive\" and have questioned their Russian counterparts on it.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin greets Russian officials, including Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, upon arrival at the remote Arctic islands of Franz Josef Land, Russia, March 29, 2017.

I asked him, 'Why are you repaving five Cold War airstrips, and why are there reportedly 10,000 Spetsnaz troops up there?'\" Navy Secretary Richard Spencer said at a Brookings Institution event on October 23, referring to Russian special operation forces.\n\n\"He said, 'search and rescue, Mr. Secretary,'\" Spencer added.\n\nAsked whether Russia was a competitor or partner or both in the Arctic, Spencer said he \"would love to say both\" but expressed concern.\n\n\"I worry about their position there,\" he said, pointing to the Northern Sea Route, which cuts shipping time between Europe and Asia by 40% compared to the Suez Canal route but runs through Russia's Exclusive Economic Zone. In April, Moscow said foreign ships using that route would have to give notice and pay higher transit fees.\n\n\"That said, dialogue must remain open. We have to keep those avenues of communication,\" Spencer added. \"You've seen the arguments compared to the Suez Canal, the time and dollar savings by going over north, that's happened. It's going to continue to happen. We have to be present.\"\n\nCatching up in the high north\n\nThe emphasis on the Arctic is a part of the \"great power competition\" described in the 2018 US National Defense Strategy, which outlined a turn away from two decades of combat against irregular forces in the Middle East and toward revisionist foes like Russia and China.\n\nBut the US still has some catching up to do when it comes to the Arctic.\n\nThe US has just one heavy icebreaker, the decrepit Polar Star, operated by the Coast Guard. Russia, which gets some 25% of its GDP from the Arctic, has more than 40 icebreakers of varying sizes with more on the way. The Coast Guard recently awarded a contract to build three new icebreakers, but the first isn't expected until 2024.\n\nMarines have deployed on rotations to Norway since 2017 and taken part in exercises in Alaska with the Army and Air Force in an effort to get used to harsh conditions at higher latitudes. But the Navy's biggest moves have come at sea.\n\nSailors and Marines aboard the USS Gunston Hall observe an underway replenishment with the USNS John Lethall, October 6, 2018. US Navy/Mass Comm.

We went north of the Arctic Circle, [and for the] first time since 1996 we had a carrier strike group and amphib ships north of the Arctic Circle,\" Spencer said at the Brookings event.\n\nTrident Juncture in late 2018 was NATO's largest exercise since the Cold War and included the carrier USS Harry S. Truman. One of the Navy ships accompanying Marines to the exercise, the USS Gunston Hall, was banged up by rough seas during the journey.\n\n\"We learned a lot, where we had to shore up our learning and where we had to shore up our sets and reps,\" Spencer said. \"Gunston Hall hit some heavy weather, [which] tore the hell out of the well deck.\"\n\nSome sailors suffered minor injuries aboard the Gunston Hall, which had to return to the US. Bad seas also forced another ship, the USS New York, to detour to Iceland, but it eventually made it to the exercise in Norway.\n\n\"I'll write a check for that kind of damage any single time, when I saw what we'd learned from going up there,\" Spencer said.\n\nSailors signal an E-2D Hawkeye ready for launch on the aircraft carrier USS Harry S.

Specialist 2nd Class Thomas Gooley\n\nThe Truman's trip above the Arctic Circle after a two-decade absence, like the USS Theodore Roosevelt's participation in the Northern Edge exercise in Alaska for the first time in a decade, is significant, and recent Navy exercises in Alaska laid the groundwork for future training up there, but whether the Navy will be back for good is uncertain.\n\n\"We will be in the Arctic Circle ... in the high north in the Atlantic and the high Pacific in the Bering Straits on a regular basis,\" Spencer said at the Brookings event.\n\n\"Will we have permanent basing up there? I don't know. Would I like to see a logistic center up there \u2014 something like a Nome [in Alaska] \u2014 that would be great,\" Spencer added.\n\nSecretary of the Navy Richard V.
