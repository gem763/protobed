But for Bertini it could be the calm before the storm.\n\nHe warns the likely new government that farmers are unlikely to take any taxes lying down: \"If they come for us, we'll raise hell.\"", "description": "Record grain harvests were a much needed boon to Argentine agribusiness this year, but farmers here see trouble ahead if leftist Peronist candidate Alberto Fernandez wins Sunday's presidential election.  \"They're coming for us,\" Deniel Perez says darkly as he gazes across a vast expanse", "authors": ["Sonia Avalos"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/b594_ilhqqNiZBoBL9ceDA--~B/aD01MjA7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_sg/News/AFP/626ef6be0ea096d0b0f8a0c46439209b20c138e3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
