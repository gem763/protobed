The policy document was published just before Trump\u2019s visit to California on Tuesday and comes amid his increasing attacks on Democrats in Los Angeles and San Francisco over the homelessness crisis.\n\nTrump further griped about the presence of homeless people while speaking to reporters on Tuesday, saying they live in \u201cour best highways, our best streets, our best entrances to buildings\u201d where people \u201cpay tremendous taxes\u201d. He said LA and San Francisco \u201cdestroy themselves by allowing what\u2019s happening\u201d and that some residents want to move away because of tent encampments.\n\nThe president further mentioned the creation of an \u201cindividual taskforce\u201d, but did not provide details, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ll be doing something about it.\u201d\n\nAdvocates across the Golden State, which has a growing homeless population and severe affordable housing shortage, have urged the US government not to further criminalize people living in poverty and instead increase funding for housing and other services, some of which Trump has cut in his budgets.\n\nRelated: Workers on frontlines of homeless crisis tell Trump: 'We don't need tough talk'\n\nThe president, who is visiting the San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles this week for fundraisers, has made his attacks on liberals in California a theme of his campaigning, and Democrats in the state have sued his administration dozens of times. Los Angeles\u2019 Skid Row, an area considered the epicenter of the homelessness crisis, has also received increasing national attention, including a tour by Trump administration officials last week and a visit Tuesday by the Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nThe CEA report noted that almost half of all unsheltered homeless people live in California, and said that \u201cpolicies such as the extent of policing of street activities\u201d may play a role in why some states have larger homeless populations. The report also said \u201cmore tolerable conditions for sleeping on the streets \u2026 increases homelessness\u201d.\n\nTom Philipson, the CEA chairman, did not elaborate on how policing could be used in a call with reporters, according to the Washington Post. It\u2019s unclear if the president would have any legal authority to use law enforcement to move people from the streets, and homelessness is an issue typically handled by local governments.\n\nResearch has repeatedly shown that criminalization of the homeless, particularly sending people living on the streets to jail, is ineffective and costly. Arrest and incarceration can make it harder for people to find housing and can leave them with criminal records and fees that create new obstacles. Still, laws that prohibit \u201ccamping\u201d on the streets are common in cities across the US, and officials in LA have been pushing for further restrictions on where people can sleep outside.\n\nThe CEA report noted that \u201cpolicies intended solely to arrest or jail homeless people simply because they are homeless are inhumane and wrong\u201d, but said \u201cwhen paired with effective services\u201d, policing can be useful.\n\n\u201cThis approach contributes to the problem rather than solving it,\u201d said Osha Neumann, a civil rights lawyer who has long advocated for the homeless in northern California. \u201cThe idea that we can criminalize our way out of a crisis that is the result of the failure of the system to provide basic human needs for a large percent of our population is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nKourtney Milligan, a 29-year-old who has been living on the streets of Skid Row for nine months, said she wished the president would \u201cchange his tone\u201d when he talks about homelessness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very aggressive and very hateful. How about we just find a solution?\u201d said Milligan, who was outside the Downtown Women\u2019s Center when O\u2019Rourke stopped by on Tuesday morning. \u201cA lot of people who are homeless have been abused and hurt. We need solutions.\u201d\n\nShe said police should not be used to kick people out, and that the residents of Skid Row needed affordable housing in the heart of Los Angeles, not on the outskirts of the city. She said she sleeps next to a building that is currently being developed for new housing, but that she doubts she\u2019d be able to afford to live there.\n\n\u201cSkid Row is home for a lot of people. There is community here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe problem is finding housing.\u201d\n\nNeumann, an attorney with the East Bay Community Law Center, said the threats of a law enforcement crackdown were \u201cconsistent with the general approach of the administration \u2013 to cause as much pain and suffering as possible to people who are desperately seeking refuge\u201d, adding: \u201cThey do it on the border, and now they are proposing to do it in the cities.\u201d", "description": "New report suggests law enforcement as \u2018tool\u2019 to deal with crisis, as Trump laments people sleeping in \u2018best entrances to buildings\u2019The homelessness crisis is evident along the sidewalks and streets in the skid row area of downtown Los Angeles.
