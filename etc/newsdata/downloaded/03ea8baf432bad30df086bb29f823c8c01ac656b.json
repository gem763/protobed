In 2010, Edurne Pasaburne became the first woman to complete all the 8,000ers.\n\nPurja opted to use supplementary oxygen for his ascents, justifying his choice by the huge size of the challenge he had set himself.\n\n\u201cI have to get back down, so that I can reach the next mountain. I listen to my body. You must have humility so that you can get home. You can always go again without oxygen if that is what is so important, but you can\u2019t if you\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nirmal Purja\u2019s photograph taken in May this year showing a queue of climbers waiting to reach Everest\u2019s summit.

Notably he climbed Everest, Lhotse and Makalu (the fourth and fifth highest peaks in the world) consecutively in just 48 hours.\n\nThe previous record was held by Kim Chang-ho, of South Korea, who took seven years, 11 months and 14 days.\n\n\u201cI am overwhelmed and incredibly proud to have completed this final summit and achieved my goal of climbing the world\u2019s 14 tallest mountains in record time,\u201d said Purja after his final ascent.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mount Everest and Lhotse.

It seemed like an impossible thing to do. Later I recall thinking maybe it could be done in a single year with the right support. But not less than seven months.\n\n\u201cEven getting up Everest is a big challenge and it is very well set up. Doing the others is far more challenging. You have to be able to suffer to climb an 8,000er. It\u2019s almost beyond description how difficult it is. Your head feels like it\u2019s bursting and you are gasping for air.\n\n\u201cNims is superbly fit, both physically and mentally \u2013 the right man at the right time. There is a little bit of luck. He had a good spell of weather in the [notoriously unsettled] Karakoram. But you make your own luck as well.\u201d\n\nPurja began the challenge, nicknamed Bremont Project Possible, when he reached the top of Annapurna on 23 April this year and has accomplished his feat with a rotating support team made up of exclusively Nepalese climbers.\n\nOn 22 May, he reached the summit of Mount Everest along with 320 other mountaineers. It was on this climb that he took the photo seen around the world of a \u201ctraffic jam\u201d to reach the summit, bringing global attention to the mountain\u2019s dangerous overcrowding.\n\nThe achievement is even more extraordinary as uncertainties in weather and conditions can reduce the window of opportunity for climbing even one mountain to a handful of days.\n\nPurja and his team were also required to obtain a special climbing permit from the China Tibet Mountaineering Association to complete his challenge when China closed Shishapangma for other climbers this season.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Annapurna, where Nirmal Purja and his team rescued a fellow climber during their descent.
