But experts say that a severe shock to energy markets and the world economy is unlikely.\n\nThe attack on the Abqaiq processing facility and another plant, deep in Saudi territory, displayed the vulnerability of the kingdom to tensions in the Persian Gulf region. The country produces about 10 percent of the world\u2019s oil supplies. The disruption could slash Saudi Arabia\u2019s daily oil exports of 7.4 million barrels by as much as three-quarters, taking roughly 5 percent of global supplies off the market, unless the facility is quickly repaired.\n\nPresident Trump suggested on Sunday that he could release supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, an attempt to calm oil markets. But oil futures jumped more than $11 a barrel as the futures market opened on Monday in Asia.\n\nThe attack raised the possibility of further disruptions in Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production if there were additional attacks on its fields and pipelines.", "description": "Experts say a severe shock to energy markets and the world economy is unlikely.
