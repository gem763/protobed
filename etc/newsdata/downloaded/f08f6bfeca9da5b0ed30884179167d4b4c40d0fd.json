Thirty inches of rain were also possible in some areas, according to the New York Times, as well as storm surges of 18 to 23 feet.\n\nDorian had been stalled by a high-pressure system in the Atlantic Ocean, CNN reported, but it was forecasted to move northward later Monday \u2014 swirling along the East Coast, past Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. Parts of those states were under mandatory evacuation.\n\nMore than 20 million Americans could be affected by the raging storm, CBS News reported Saturday.\n\nThe network added that the Bahamas would feel hurricane conditions Sunday \u2014 where Dorian made landfall shortly before 1 p.m. local time and again at 2 p.m. \u2014 though the hurricane could miss Florida and make landfall in the U.S. over South Carolina on Wednesday or Thursday. Its intensity at that time was still unclear, according to the Times.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center was providing regular updates on social media and directed residents of specific states to its regional offices for further information.\n\nThe number of victims and approximate property damage from Dorian was not immediately clear on Monday, though aid workers said up to 13,000 homes may have already been severely damaged or destroyed, CNN reported.\n\nFlorida lawmaker Shevrin Jones on Sunday tweeted video he said was from his family in the Bahamas. \u201cPlease pray for us,\u201d an emotional woman is heard saying in one clip, which shows submerged homes, surging water and gusting winds.\n\n\u201cPeople are sending voice notes, people are crying,\u201d one local official told the Times. \u201cYou can hear people hollering in the background.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust finish[ed] messaging my family in the Bahamas. They have no power and there\u2019s a lot of flooding. Everyone is safe!\u201d Jones tweeted on Monday.\n\nRELATED: Hurricane Dorian Could Hit as \u2018Life-Threatening\u2019 Storm, Experts Warn\n\nView photos The first moment of the arrival of Hurricane Dorian in Freeport, Grand Bahama, in the Bahamas on Sunday | Ramon Espinosa/AP/Shutterstock More\n\nView photos A satellite image of Hurricane Dorian on Sunday | NASA EARTH OBSERVATORY HANDOUT/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock More\n\nVideo from my family in the Bahamas \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf8\u2014 -#Bahamas pic.twitter.com/Kbp8a7J5F2 \u2014 Shevrin Jones (@ShevrinJones) September 1, 2019", "description": "Hurricane Dorian's Landfall in the Bahamas: Video", "authors": ["Georgia Slater"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/isEHErb6UruOsd8c6ECxCA--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/33edf5381ad194b7c2d7f50aacd726a1"}
