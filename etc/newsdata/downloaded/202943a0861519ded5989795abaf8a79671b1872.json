I was so surprised when it fit.\n\n\"Being told I looked stunning all day took a bit of getting used to, to be honest.\n\n\"After being in a one-sided relationship for years, I felt really proud of myself. Before I couldn't walk even a few steps. I can even tie my shoelaces again. I can now walk without turning red and getting out of breath.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"I saved myself from a heart attack. I'm ashamed [of how I used to be]. \"Now, I feel like a normal person again and have such a healthier life.\"\n\nFeeling unhappy in her relationship, Chelsey had binged on Indian takeaways and chocolate - spending up to \u00a330 a day on greasy meals.\n\nBut as a newly single woman in May 2017, Chelsey did try to lose weight - though shedding just two stone in a year.\n\nAnd when her obesity left her unable to walk just a few steps, she had a gastric sleeve fitted in September 2018.\n\nAs the months passed, she saw the weight melt away and before she knew it, she was ordering a size 16 wedding dress - something she never dreamt was possible.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nThree weeks before her wedding in July this year, she was amazed to try on the beautiful gown and feel it slip over her slim frame - excitedly sending it off for alterations.\n\nChelsey said: \"My wedding dress was ordered from America and it arrived just four weeks before the wedding. It was altered around three weeks before the big day to a size 12.\n\n\"On the day I felt amazing. I have much more self worth. Now I have the support of a wonderful husband and feel a lot better about myself. The surgery changed a lot. I've got the support I need now and I know anything is possible.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"I had to re-program my brain when it came to food and I've learnt a lot. I'm at my target weight now and will be keeping at it.\"\n\nWhen she first started her search of love more than a year ago, Chelsey never imagined she would be settling down into married life already.\n\nBut she admits finding love and being able to rely on Owen possibly saved her life.\n\nChelsey said: \"I have always had problems with my weight and due to the situation with my ex, it was made worse. The relationship triggered me to put on weight.\n\n(Image: Kennedy/LovemorePhotography)\n\n\"I left my ex and went on dating sites. I joined Plenty of Fish and which is where I met Owen.\n\n\"When I joined it I was so self conscious. Dating online is difficult as it is and people tend to be on it for just one thing.\n\n\n\n\"It feels so good to go to the shops and pick any clothes you want, knowing they'll fit.\"", "description": "Thanks to an NHS gastric sleeve Chelsey Goold, from Cumbernauld, Scotland, found the confidence to find love and get married", "authors": ["Sophie Norris", "Sam Elliott", "Image", "Kennedy Lovemorephotography", "Kennedy News", "Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20704387.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-KennedyLovemorePhotography.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
