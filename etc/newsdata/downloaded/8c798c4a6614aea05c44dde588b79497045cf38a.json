The Barefoot Investor series, written by Scott Pape, is a nine-step guide to financial freedom, with one of its most popular take-home messages being the 'bucket theory' of learning. It involves taking your income and separating it into three distinct 'buckets' of money: The 'blow', 'mojo' and 'grow'. You'll deposit money into your 'blow' bucket to use on daily expenses, the occasional splurge and some extra cash to fight any financial fires that might be afoot. The 'mojo' bucket is a net of 'safety money' in case your car suddenly breaks down or you need to replace a lost of stolen product. And finally the 'grow' bucket is almost an untouchable fund which builds long-term wealth and provides total security.\n\nBut ultimately the determination paid off and they were able to purchase a house in the $300-$400k price point, in September - only nine months after they started employing the monetary strategies.\n\nThe Barefoot Investor series, written by Scott Pape, is a nine-step guide to financial freedom, with one of its most popular take-home messages being the 'bucket theory' of learning.\n\nIt involves taking your income and separating it into three distinct 'buckets' of money: 'blow', 'mojo' and 'grow', representing daily expenses and some treats, savings that will meet occasional out-of-pocket expenses, and untouchable funds to put toward long-term life goals.\n\nAfter reading the book Amy, who spent three years studying accounting, drafted a few budgets and tweaked them to suit their lifestyle\n\nAfter reading the book Amy, who spent three years studying accounting, drafted a few budgets and tweaked them to suit their lifestyle.\n\n'We became very conscious of our spending habits and tried to determine our wants and needs,' she said.\n\nScott Pape (pictured) has become a household name after sharing his finance strategies\n\n'The book really teaches you to break down your financial position using percentages, which worked well for us as we could visually see what we were spending and how much we could save.'\n\nThey rewarded themselves by splurging on a holiday in July to Thailand and Malaysia, spending two weeks relaxing and enjoying the fruits of their labour.\n\nThey rewarded themselves with a trip in July to Thailand and Malaysia, spending two weeks relaxing and enjoying the fruits of their labour\n\nWhat are The Barefoot Investor's nine steps? 1. Schedule a monthly Barefoot Date night to catch up on where you are financially. 2. Set up your three buckets for housing your income each pay check. 3. Get rid of your debts. 4. Buy your home. 5. Increase your super to 15 per cent. 6. Increase your mojo bucket to allow for three months of living expenses, in case of an emergency. 7. Get the bankers off your back by lowering your interest rate and making extra repayments. 8. Nail your retirement number so you're never out of money. 9. Leave a legacy behind.\n\n'This was important to us as we still wanted to maintain a comfortable standard of living and we needed a break after working so much,' she said.\n\nTheir best advice for those also looking to get into the market is to 'learn to live with less', find what makes you happy outside of material possessions and find yourself a trustworthy broker.\n\n'Set realistic goals so you can still enjoy life and enjoy the process; you only buy your first home once, right?' She said.\n\n'Think of buying a house as a business transaction. Detach the emotion, like fear, from the transaction.
