So I\u2019m not going to give you one of those grandiose overviews of the Democratic primary. Maybe we\u2019ll be more in the mood for one after this week\u2019s debate.\n\nNope, I just want to make a narrower point: Joe Biden is still doing reasonably well in the polls.\n\nElizabeth Warren\u2019s doing well, too! She probably hasn\u2019t overtaken Biden in national polls, yet, but it\u2019s pretty darn close \u2014 close enough that she was momentarily ahead in one national polling average (from RealClearPolitics) last week. You\u2019d certainly rather be in Warren\u2019s shoes than Biden\u2019s in Iowa and New Hampshire. (Although not in South Carolina, and the Super Tuesday states aren\u2019t so clear.) In fact, if you want to argue that she\u2019s the most likely nominee, I don\u2019t have any real problem with that. I also don\u2019t have any real problem if you think it\u2019s Biden, or that it\u2019s too close to call.\n\nBut Warren\u2019s gains have come mostly at the expense of the rest of the field \u2014 from Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders, in particular \u2014 and from other candidates, such as Cory Booker, whose campaigns never really took off in the first place. Relatively little of Warren\u2019s increased support has come from Biden, whose topline numbers have mostly been steady.\n\nIn fact, Biden\u2019s numbers haven\u2019t declined at all since President Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine became the dominant political story. We can see this by taking a before and after comparison of polls that have come out in the past couple of weeks. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint an exact date when Ukraine and impeachment rose to the top of the news. But Monday, September 23, when seven first-term Democratic members of Congress published an editorial calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment over allegations that he encouraged Ukraine to investigate Biden and and his son, was probably the closest thing to an inflection point. (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came out in favor of an impeachment inquiry the next day; that Wednesday, the White House published its summary of Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.) So here are the results from nine pollsters who have conducted a national poll since Sept. 23.\n\nNational Democratic primary polls since Sept. 23 Average results of Democratic primary candidates in national polls conducted after Sept. 23, 2019, op-ed calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment Candidate Fox Har YG Q\u2019pac M.C.

I don\u2019t necessarily buy that Warren pulled ahead of Biden last week, as the RCP average briefly showed; for some reason, RCP\u2019s average didn\u2019t include HarrisX, which is usually one of Biden\u2019s better polls. It\u2019s also sort of a moot point, though. There\u2019s no national primary, and if Warren keeps gaining ground at the rate she has been over the past few months, she\u2019ll surpass Biden eventually.\n\nWhat there hasn\u2019t been, though, is much sign of a decline in Biden\u2019s numbers, despite all the media narratives constantly predicting one. Here was the most recent pre-Ukraine version (all interviews conducted before Sept. 23) of those same national polls.\n\nNational Democratic primary polls before Sept. 23 Average results of Democratic primary candidates in national polls conducted before the Sept. 23, 2019, op-ed calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment Candidate Fox Har YG Q\u2019pac M.C.

There\u2019s been no decline at all, obviously. Warren has gained quite a bit of ground, though, having gone from 19 percent to 24.7 percent. Where is that support coming from?\n\nBiden is steady, and Warren is gaining, post-Ukraine news Average results of Democratic primary candidates in national polls before and after the Sept. 23, 2019, op-ed calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment Candidate Before Sept. 23 Since Sept. 23 Change Biden 26.9% 27.4% +0.6 Warren 19.0 24.7 +5.7 Sanders 16.1 15.0 -1.1 Buttigieg 5.3 5.1 -0.2 Harris 7.2 4.7 -2.6 Yang 2.4 2.7 +0.2 O\u2019Rourke 2.1 2.0 -0.1 Booker 2.8 1.4 -1.3 Klobuchar 1.2 1.3 +0.1 Castro 0.9 1.0 +0.1 Gabbard 0.9 0.7 -0.2 Steyer 0.5 0.6 +0.1 If a pollster has published multiple polls in that time frame, only the most recent poll was counted. Only candidates who have qualified for next week\u2019s debate are listed in the chart. Totals may not add up exactly due to rounding.\n\nSome of it has come from Harris, whom Warren is competing with for college-educated voters. Some has come from Sanders. And some of it may have come from second-tier candidates such as Booker, whose solid debate performances seem to have been forgotten and who is back to just 1 or 2 percent in the polls. YouGov\u2019s polling of early-state voters suggests that relatively little of it has come from Biden, on the other hand.\n\nIf there\u2019s a bit of bad news for Warren, it\u2019s that she\u2019s already picked off a lot of the low-hanging fruit. She can perhaps grab a few more Sanders voters, especially if some are concerned over the heart attack he suffered two weeks ago. But Sanders has already lost around two-thirds of the voters that he had in 2016, so the ones that remain with him may be a relatively hardy lot. Meanwhile, there aren\u2019t that many more Harris supporters to win over.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s all going swimmingly for Biden, either. Although his topline numbers haven\u2019t changed much, Warren has surpassed him on measures of enthusiasm, she tends to have better favorability ratings than he does, and, obviously, Iowa and New Hampshire are huge potential liabilities for Biden if he loses them.\n\nBut our thesis about Biden\u2019s candidacy has never been that he\u2019s the most perfect candidate or has run the most flawless campaign, but rather that he commands deep loyalty from constituencies that often receive little coverage from media elites, including seniors, non-college-educated whites, African Americans and moderates. There aren\u2019t many signs that these voters support Biden solely because of name recognition, or that their support is otherwise superficial. In fact, Biden \u2014 like Warren \u2014 often does better among voters who are paying the most attention to the campaign.\n\nNow, if you want to argue that the 70 percent of Democrats who don\u2019t have Biden as their first choice are cooling on him, I think you\u2019re on firmer ground. And that could absolutely be a problem for him if he and Warren \u2014 perhaps along with other candidates \u2014 are scrambling to pick up additional supporters after the early states.\n\nTo a first approximation, though, Biden\u2019s numbers have been quite steady. Other than a post-announcement bounce, when he briefly surged to near 40 percent, he\u2019s been somewhere between 26 percent and 32 percent in the RCP average for literally the entire campaign:\n\nIn contrast to certain other campaigns, which naively thought that Biden\u2019s support might just up and disappear, Warren\u2019s team has caught up to him the hard way: by building a coalition of around 25 percent of the Democratic electorate on her own, including many voters that were initially skeptical of her.\n\nEmpirically speaking, the mid-to-high-20s in the polls tends to be a fairly robust and sustainable position. It doesn\u2019t necessarily make you a favorite to win the nomination, especially when there\u2019s another candidate who\u2019s polling at about the same number. But through this point in a presidential primary, few candidates who have sustained numbers in the mid-to-high-20s have completely flopped. Those numbers tend to be good enough that you\u2019ll win your share of states (past Iowa caucus winners have often gotten around 25 to 30 percent of the vote) or at least your share of delegates. They mean that you\u2019ll probably be one of the trains leaving the station as the field starts to winnow. They reflect a measure of success unto themselves.\n\nAll right, this is getting a little grandiose, so let\u2019s save the rest of the analysis for after the debate. Besides, the Democratic primary just isn\u2019t all that complicated right now. Roughly speaking, the nomination process is going reasonably well for both Warren and Biden. And while there are other candidates who are exceeding expectations, it isn\u2019t going all that well for anyone else.", "description": "Biden's numbers are steady in post-Ukraine polls.", "authors": ["Nate Silver"], "top_image": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175145085-1.jpg?w=575", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
