I think we\u2019re as talented as we were at any of those times.\u201d\n\nDallas went 13-3 and had a first-round bye 12 years ago before losing at home to the New York Giants in a divisional playoff. Quarterback Dak Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliott did the same thing as rookies in 2016, losing the divisional playoff to Green Bay.\n\nBut the 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year is three years wiser - despite Prescott\u2019s ill-conceived interception against the dismantled Dolphins - and Elliott has won two rushing titles.\n\nIn the second half against Miami, the defense finally looked a little more like the 2018 unit that played a big part in Dallas making the playoffs. The Dolphins didn\u2019t score while gaining just 67 yards after halftime.\n\n\u201cForget the record,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cThis team can be really good, and we have to focus on that and how we get there. I promise you those guys in the locker room that we have are going to come in with the mindset of how we are going to get better and not about the fact that we\u2019re 3-0.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe Cowboys thought they found a hidden gem in the fourth round in Memphis running back Tony Pollard. He showed it while Elliott was holding out seeking a new contract, seizing the lead role until the two-time rushing champion returned with a new deal.\n\nThe rookie showed it again in his most extensive regular-season action, getting 103 yards on 13 carries and his first touchdown, a 16-yarder. With Elliott\u2019s 125-yard day, the Cowboys had two 100-yard rushers in the same game for the first time since Hall of Famer Emmitt Smith did it alongside Chris Warren in 1998.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nPrescott\u2019s interception was a bad one - a deep throw into a mass of defensive backs after he had more than enough time to throw (\u201cwent through every read probably three times, I guess\u201d). A quarterback whose strength has always been protecting the ball has interceptions in consecutive games, both on messy plays. Prescott needs to get back to making sure the messy plays don\u2019t result in turnovers.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nThe pass rushing tandem of DeMarcus Lawrence and Robert Quinn looked promising at first glance. Each had a sack as the Cowboys finished with three. Quinn was making his Dallas debut following a two-game suspension for performance enhancers.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nThe team\u2019s first 100-yard penalty day of the season (eight for 100) included a holding call against left guard Connor Williams that wiped out a 74-yard touchdown pass to Randall Cobb.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\nThird and 20 - Prescott\u2019s 33-yard completion to Jason Witten converted that long third down. It was a broken play, with Prescott scrambling to the open field and forcing Witten\u2019s defender to close. The 37-year-old Witten, in his record 16th season, caught the touch pass over the shoulder on the run along the sideline. \u201cMe playing a little backyard football and a guy that\u2019s played football for a long time,\u201d Prescott said.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nAfter being 22-point favorites against the rebuilding Dolphins, the Cowboys get the Saints without Drew Brees on Sunday in New Orleans, although Teddy Bridgewater helped lead a win over Seattle.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Dallas Cowboys are averaging 32 points and 481 yards per game during their first 3-0 start since 2008, and the defending NFC East champions already have a two-game lead in the division.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Schuyler Dixon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/dolphins_cowboys_football_35649_c0-301-3590-2394_s1770x1032.jpg?a9d58fb72b60553ebf896581e35a6fadf480b8c3", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
