Kavanaugh, who was a staunch defender of his boss during the controversial hearings last year, for the federal bench Thursday over Democrats\u2019 concerns the pick lacked enough trial experience to be a judge.\n\nJustin Walker was confirmed to the U.S. Western District of Kentucky by a 50-41 vote. He became the 110th district court judge appointed by President Trump.\n\nMr. Walker teaches legal writing at the University of Louisville. He previously clerked for Justice Kavanaugh when he sat on the federal appeals court in Washington and clerked at the Supreme Court for now-retired Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.\n\nDuring Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings, Mr. Walker appeared regularly on network television to defend his former boss\u2019s record and reputation after the nominee faced allegations of sexual misconduct. Justice Kavanaugh vehemently denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cFor those of us who know Justin Walker and have seen his work up close it\u2019s clear that President Trump made an outstanding choice to be a district judge for the Western District of Kentucky,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday. \u201cMr. Walker has sharpened his legal skills at the highest levels.\u201d\n\nDemocrats opposed Mr. Walker, saying he only worked on a single trial, which did not require him to speak in the courtroom, and noted he has conducted just one deposition.\n\nThey said a nominee for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench should have more experience in the courtroom.\n\n\u201cThis nominee is not qualified for the district court,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin said earlier this month.\n\n\u201cRather than gaining experience in a courtroom, he spends much of his time in recent years personally appearing on television and radio. He has done nearly 100 media appearances. Mr. Walker lacks the basic experience that a district court judge needs,\u201d the Illinois Democrat said.\n\nCiting his lack of experience, the American Bar Association rated Mr. Walker not qualified.\n\nTypically a judicial nominee needs 12 years of litigation experience to get a good rating from the ABA, but Mr. Walker has been out of law school for only about 10 years.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
