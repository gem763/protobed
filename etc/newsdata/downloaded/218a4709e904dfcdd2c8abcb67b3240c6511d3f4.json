Rugby World Cup team of round two 1/15 1, Ellis Genge (England) The loosehead prop may have only come on for England at half-time, but there had not been a run at the World Cup from a prop quite like what Genge produced against the USA. A barn-storming run saw him outpace one defender and trample over another, breaking the best part of 50 metres before it took two men to stop him. He was also excellent in the scrum to win countless penalties as the USA wilted. AP 2/15 2. Julian Montoya (Argentina) It takes something special to shine in Agustin Creevy\u2019s absence, but Montoya delivered with an excellent hat-trick to help lead Argentina to victory over Tonga. Montoya was smart to stay wide following a lineout for his first try, was the beneficiary of the rolling maul for the second and powered his way over from close range for a classy 26-minute hat-trick. AP 3/15 3. Levan Chilachava (Georgia) It\u2019s not often a Georgian makes the team of the round, but Chilachava lead an inspired Georgian pack to dominate Uruguay in their Sunday clash, scoring a try in the bonus-point victory and monstering the opposition front row in the scrum.

Lood de Jager (South Africa) The Springbok needed a big performance to strengthen his case for selection in what is a very competitive area for South Africa, and the giant second row delivered emphatically with a man-of-the-match performance. He may not have got on the scoresheet, but his impact in destroying Namibia\u2019s gameplan was standout nonetheless. AP 6/15 6. Aaron Wainwright (Wales) A young player whose development at the World Cup is really turning heads. Wainwright did not look out of place up against one of the greats of the game against David Pocock, and it was his ball-carrying ability that really stood out in an eye-catching performance. Getty Images 7/15 7. Lewis Ludlam (England) A remarkable rise to prominence saw Ludlam score his first World Cup try for England in the demolition of the USA, but it was his all-round performance last week that earns him his place in the side.

Gareth Davies (Wales) Australia could not keep Davies out of the game in Tokyo, with the scrum-half twice intercepting Will Genia and Bernard Foley and nearly bagging himself a third in the second half. He was also excellent at injecting pace into the game and tried to catch the defence napping throughout. Getty Images 10/15 10. Felipe Berchesi (Uruguay) The Uruguayan was excellent in Uruguay\u2019s victory over Fiji, with the South American\u2019s forced to double-up across the round by playing Georgia a handful of days later. Berchesi had to make do with a team on the back foot more often than not, yet managed to release his outside backs to run Fiji ragged. AFP/Getty Images 11/15 11. Makazole Mapimpi (South Africa) Mapimpi emerged from the shadow of Cheslin Kolbe to star in South Africa\u2019s rout of Namibia, scoring two tries to trigger the landslide victory. Mapimpi may not get the shower of praise that his elusive teammate receives, but he showed how dangerous he can be with the ball in hand, showing a devastating turn of pace backed up by some serious power.

AP\n\nFor the centre, it will complete his World Cup circle, having made his first appearance in the competition against the Pumas at the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. Back then, Tuilagi was able to train as much as he wanted, play as much as he wanted and do whatever he wanted on and off the field, only for the start of his litany of injuries in 2014 to completely change the ways he manages his body.\n\n\u201cI could never be the old me again,\u201d he added. \u201cIt's different now. The old me used to just go out and play and train. Now I need to warm up for 30 minuets before I start. Also, I would say I enjoy it more now. I enjoy it more than before.\n\n\u201cI need to make sure I do what I need to do to prepare for a game, especially training, that is the most important thing for me. To know all the calls and know my job in terms of putting it together with the game plan. I don\u2019t look far ahead. One training session at a time, one day at a time.\n\n\u201cIce-baths, massage, pilates, just to try and keep everything loose, especially after games and training sessions. Sometimes you don\u2019t want to do it but to get to the training field you\u2019ve got to get over the bridge.\u201d\n\nTuilagi missed international rugby for the best part of five seasons, including the 2015 World Cup through injury and suspension, and England has certainly missed Tuilagi.\n\n\u201cHe can spook players through his defensive pressure,\u201d said defence coach John Mitchell. \u201cIf he gets you man and ball it\u2019s not that comfortable for the attack. Also, when the defence does a good job on the inside, then having someone like Manu who can be fed pretty quickly and can deal with traffic or space is pretty handy.\n\n\u201cYou have a quiet word with Manu. He is not a guy you overload with lectures or video. I find him very coachable. I don\u2019t need to give him a lot of information. As long as I am giving him the right stuff, he\u2019ll form an opinion.\n\n\u201cHe has gained belief because he is prepared really well. He has had a long pre-season and he has been specifically prepared based on himself and his previous limitations through injury so I think that has given him confidence as it has allowed him to build and get to this point.\n\n\u201cThe second thing is that he is older, he is also a father and happily married so that brings responsibilities and a different maturity as well. I think he is in a particularly good space because he is being managed well, he is being led well which then leads to his own leadership taking ownership of it.\u201d", "description": "Manu Tuilagi believes the toll that his four-year run of injuries has taken on his body means this Rugby World Cup campaign will be his last.
