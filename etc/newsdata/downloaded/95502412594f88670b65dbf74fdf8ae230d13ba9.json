For example, in their lexicon of euphemisms, raging rows are described as \u2018constructive debates\u2019.\n\nThe German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) gave Boris Johnson (left), or more specifically his Brexit proposals, the diplomatic cold shoulder, writes SIMON WALTERS\n\nYet officials in No 10 went out of their way to do the opposite yesterday. Gone was any attempt to gloss over differences. They ramped up the rhetoric by claiming Merkel\u2019s comments meant \u2018a deal is essentially impossible not just now... but ever\u2019.\n\nThe provocative nature of the briefing, though, paled into insignificance compared to a rant, made public 12 hours earlier, by a No 10 insider who swore death and destruction to anyone who tried to stop the UK cutting ties with Brussels on October 31.\n\nThe Downing Street \u2018source\u2019 quoted by The Spectator bore the unmistakably contemptuous and crude tone of Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings.\n\nThe \u2018source\u2019 made a series of extra-ordinary, lurid claims, including that it was a \u2018delusion\u2019 to think Merkel would help Britain; warning that if the talks failed, any prospect of the UK \u2018sincerely co-operating\u2019 with the EU \u2018will be in the toilet\u2019; rounding on MPs plotting to stop Brexit by highlighting their precarious standing in a Parliament \u2018as popular as the clap\u2019; and accusing Irish PM Leo Varadkar of ratting on a promise to make concessions in return for a similar move by Johnson.\n\nThankfully, Johnson was more dignified when he spoke to Merkel. But his message was essentially the same.\n\nHe told her that talks on his Brexit proposals were \u2018close to breaking down\u2019, he was not convinced \u2018there was any desire for negotiation\u2019 from Brussels and that European leaders holding out in expectation of Brexit being reversed by a second referendum were barking up the wrong tree.\n\nWith just a week to go before the EU summit \u2013 the last opportunity to thrash out a deal \u2013 it seems both sides have given up any hope of agreement.\n\nWe are entering the end-game of a complex \u2013 yet fruitless \u2013 series of negotiations that began more than six years ago when David Cameron set out Britain\u2019s problems with the EU and pledged to hold an in-out referendum on Britain\u2019s membership.\n\nPredictably, EU president Donald Tusk, who once spoke of a \u2018special place in hell\u2019 for \u2018those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan\u2019, led the EU\u2019s counter-attack on Johnson. Tusk accused him of \u2018playing a stupid blame game\u2019 \u2013 a charge repeated by Labour\u2019s Brexit spokesman and wannabe leader Keir Starmer. Officially, the Prime Minister is clinging to his pledge that if he cannot get a deal he will take the UK out of the EU on October 31 without one. Unofficially, his allies admit the chances are very slim. His hands are tied by the Benn Act, which stipulates that he must ask Parliament\u2019s permission on any Brexit deal. He also faces a \u2018rebel alliance\u2019 of Labour, Lib Dems, Scots Nats and a former Tory MPs who lost the party whip for opposing No Deal.\n\nPolitically, economically, constitutionally and socially, the long-term future of Britain will be decided in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Downing Street \u2018source\u2019 quoted by The Spectator bore the unmistakably contemptuous and crude tone of Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings, writes SIMON WALTERS\n\nOn a personal level, Johnson\u2019s credibility is at stake. Above all, how would the public react if he failed to deliver on his promise that Britain will leave the EU on October 31, \u2018do or die\u2019?\n\nNearly everyone in Westminster agrees this would mean a general election in November is inevitable. Even charismatic Johnson may struggle to sweet-talk people into blaming everyone else \u2013 Parliament, Brussels and the judges \u2013 rather than himself.\n\nThe opinion polls give him a decent lead over Labour. But an election held after Johnson had so dramatically failed would play into the hands of both Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage.\n\nIndeed, I believe the threat to the Tories would be greater from the latter and his Brexit Party. They will accuse the Government of betraying the 17.4 million who voted Leave, dishonouring democracy by failing to implement the referendum result and sacrificing the country\u2019s interests because of Conservative Party infighting. They will argue that we have no choice but to leave the EU without a deal.\n\nAnd therein lies Johnson\u2019s next big dilemma. To win an election he must get the support of disaffected pro-Leave Tories who were among those who voted the Brexit Party into first place in this year\u2019s Euro election.\n\nAs the Downing Street \u2018source\u2019 made clear yesterday, hardliners surrounding Johnson want him to campaign on an unequivocal No Deal manifesto.\n\nWisely, former Tory leader William Hague articulated the horror felt by mainstream Eurosceptic Tories at such a scorched-earth approach. He said: \u2018A hardline election message, shorn of any hope of compromise, will leave many traditional but moderate Tories with their pencils hovering over the Lib Dem box on polling day.\u2019\n\nIronically, although polar opposites in style and language, moderate Hague and manic Cummings want the same thing: A Brexit deal by October 31.\n\nAnd it is just possible that there is one tiny, common ray of hope in the utterances from both Hague and the \u2018source\u2019 who briefed The Spectator.\n\nIt is Hague\u2019s suggestion that the only chance of getting a deal in the few days left is to put a time limit on the controversial Northern Ireland backstop. This, he concedes, would \u2018involve a climbdown\u2019 by Johnson, Varadkar and Brussels but, he insists it is the best solution for all three.\n\nAt the same time, the \u2018source\u2019 forecast that Brussels will make a last-minute offer of a time-limited backstop but predicted that Johnson would reject it, adding: \u2018That will probably be the end.\u2019 This could explain Downing Street\u2019s angry reaction to Merkel\u2019s comments to the PM. She reportedly said Northern Ireland would have to stay in the customs union \u2018for ever\u2019, although Berlin disputed No 10\u2019s version of the conversation.\n\nMore pragmatic voices close to Johnson would urge the PM to grab any olive branch with both hands as the best way to pull himself out of his \u2013 and Europe\u2019s \u2013 Brexit nightmare.", "description": "SIMON WALTERS: More pragmatic voices close to Johnson would urge the PM to grab any olive branch with both hands as the best way to pull himself out of his - and Europe's - Brexit nightmare.", "authors": ["Simon Walters For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/23/19466294-0-image-a-41_1570575575304.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
