The mask will come out this Saturday at the O2 when Prograis fights Josh Taylor for a glittering pile of world title belts.\n\n\u201cThere is New Orleans in my blood - I can feel it,\u201d said Prograis, who is the first world champion from the city since Willie Pastrano lost his title in 1965. \u201cThe Rougarou is me, it\u2019s my way of warning opponents that I will change, adapt and take everything they have when we fight.\u201d The Big Foot of the Bayou, as the shape-changing monster is often known, has been used by generations of parents to scare their kids.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

In 2005, just hours before Hurricane Katrina landed and destroyed large parts of New Orleans, left the city flooded and killed 1,8333 people, Prograis and his family fled.\n\nIt was his grandma\u2019s idea, Prograis thought it was just another scare, but his grandma had heard the tearful mayor, Ray Nagin, say that the coming storm would be more vicious, powerful and deadly than Hurricane Betsy. \u201cShe lived through that and said she would never do it again,\u201d added Prograis. In 1965 Betsy tore through the feeble New Orleans flood defence system, obliterated blocks, especially in the Ninth Ward, and the water surge covered homes and killed 81 people. In New Orleans the annual hurricane season fills nightmares just like the Rougarou.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

October top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 3/11 9. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 4/11 8. Gennady Golovkin (39-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. The boxing legend is now a two-time world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 6/11 6. Errol Spence (26-0-0) Spence beat Shawn Porter to unify the welterweight division as he goes in search of more belts. Danny Garcia looks set to be next. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (17-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion has successfully moved up in weight, beating Chazz Witherspoon on his heavyweight debut. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

That was my life when we left, but I realised that you can\u2019t worry about material things.\u201d It was not a simple journey for Prograis, his grandma and cousins; his mother stayed with her job in New Orleans and his father, they divorced in 2004, went to Detroit. They were all part of a human disaster and exodus that, looking back now, defies logic, thousands of people walking away clutching children, bags and ragged pets as the killer storm approaches at hundreds of miles an hour. The Prograis home on Kuebel Drive in the Lower Ninth Ward vanished in the flood and remains an empty piece of flat land to this day.\n\nPrograis lived in 17 different places, motels, garages, begged living room floors before settling in Houston, a city of refuge for so many Katrina victims. He went to five different high schools. He had started to box just weeks before leaving and he went back to boxing in Houston, hitting bags at the famous Savannah gym as Evander Holyfield was in the ring sparring. \u201cI just had to get on with life,\u201d said Prograis. \u201cI had to keep telling myself that there is no such thing as bad.\u201d Prograis was doing his best against the familiar, sickening elements that can, like the Rougarou, take a young boy forever. He fought 94 times as an amateur, winning 87.\n\n\u201cI live in Houston, but New Orleans will always be my home,\u201d said Prograis, who has the city\u2019s skyline inked across his chest. \u201cI will go back, I will put back, but right now there are just too many distractions in the city for me, now it\u2019s about my boxing career.\u201d\n\nAfter Prograis turned professional in 2012 he insists that he fought for free or next to nothing five times in his first ten fights; one promoter paid him with a cheque for just one dollar, which he has framed somewhere in his home. \u201cThat is the boxing world that people never get to see and that is where I started,\u201d said Prograis, an expert on sacrifice.\n\nPrograis is now unbeaten in 24 fights, 20 have ended quickly and he enters the ring behind his mask holding the WBA and WBC belts at light-welterweight; Taylor is unbeaten in 15 fights and he will be defending his IBF belt. It is a rare, rare fight for a British boxer, a once each generation event, both unbeaten, both world champions.\n\nPrograis has lived a life of suffering, survived death and destruction, lost his home, his friends and his community. He is a displaced idol, searching for a place of permanent safety in many ways and also one of boxing\u2019s best fighters. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just lucky,\u201d he said. He meant it and that tells you all you need to know.", "description": "The Louisiana Rougarou can shift shape, take souls and slip back under the thick green slime of the swamps that surround the burning lights of New Orleans.
