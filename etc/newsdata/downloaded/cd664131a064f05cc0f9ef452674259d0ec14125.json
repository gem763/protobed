Why? Well, Inter finished third in the table that season, but were awarded the title after champions Juve and second-placed AC Milan were both found guilty of offences in the infamous 'Calciopoli' scandal.\n\nShameful instances of match-fixing came to light, in a year when the country's national team won the World Cup in Germany. Italian football was at its lowest ebb, and the re-opening of the whole episode continues to deepen the already vigorous animosity between Juventus and Internazionale.\n\nJuventus captain Fabio Cannavaro lifts the 2005-06 Serie A trophy which was later stripped\n\nThe man at the centre of the 'Calciopoli' scandal was Juventus sporting director Luciano Moggi\n\nWhen you look into the details of the 2006 'Calciopoli' scandal, it was staggering how quickly Juve ascended back into the upper echelons of domestic and European football.\n\nIronically, claims of match-fixing were only discovered by chance; prosecutors were investigating on Italian football agency GEA World, regarding claims of doping involving Juventus' team doctor in the 1990s.\n\nConsequently, police stumbled across phone conversations between Juventus board members and officials at Serie A regarding referees, and the favouring of referees towards the 'Old Lady' in matches.\n\nThe man at the centre of the scandal was Luciano Moggi: Juventus sporting director at the time, Moggi attempted to influence games with the selection of certain referees who could side with Juventus regarding dubious calls.\n\nJuventus manager at the time Fabio Capello resigned after the scandal and joined Real Madrid\n\nThe fall-out was gigantic.\n\nOn July 4 2006, the same day Italy stunned hosts Germany in the World Cup semi-finals, the Italian Football Federation's prosecutor Stefano Palazzi called for Juve, AC Milan, Fiorentina and Lazio to be thrown out of Serie A.\n\nA lengthy appeals process followed, but Juventus were nonetheless penalised the harshest, and were accused of 'creating a system to alter the outcome of matches.'\n\nIt was a triple whammy: Juve were relegated to Serie B, deducted nine points after originally being docked 30, and had their 2004-05 & 2005-06 league titles stripped from them - the latter controversially awarded to Inter Milan, who originally finished third.\n\nA scandal which rocked Italy to the core, at a period when jubilation should have been at the forefront.\n\nTHE PUNISHMENTS FROM THE 'CALCIOPOLI' SCANDAL Club Punishment Juventus\n\nRelegated to Serie B\n\nDeducted nine points\n\nStripped of their 04-05 & 05-06 Serie A titles\n\nAC Milan Deducted eight points in Serie A Had 30 points taken off 2005-06 campaign, resulting in going from second to third in the table Fiorentina Deducted 15 points in Serie A (originally relegated to Serie B) Had 30 points taken off 2005-06 campaign\n\nOut of 2006-07 Champions League, due to position in the table going from fourth to ninth Lazio Deducted 3 points in Serie A (originally relegated to Serie B) Had 30 points taken off 2005-06 campaign\n\nOut of 2006-07 UEFA Cup, due to position in the table going from fifth to 16th Reggina Deducted 11 points in Serie A Fined \u20ac100,000\n\nYet there were also direct implications for the rivalry between Inter and Juventus which have only ascended since.\n\nPatrick Vieira and Zlatan Ibrahimovic were not part of the stalwarts who worked to get Juventus immediately promoted from Serie B - they jumped ship. Where? Inter of course.\n\nThough neither player was a linchpin for Jose Mourinho's treble-winning Inter side in 2010, Juventus' demise at the end of the last decade coincided with Inter's rise to the top of European football.\n\nBut, Mourinho left Inter that summer, Conte joined Juve a year later in 2011, and the complexion irreversibly changed.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic moved from Juventus to Inter Milan following the 2006 Calciopoli scandal\n\nAntonio Conte managed Juventus to three Scudettos but is now in charge of arch-rivals Inter\n\nJuventus have won eight straight Scudettos since, with Inter nowhere near reaching the heavy heights set in 2010.\n\nYet now, after a period as national team manager and at Chelsea, Conte has moved over to Inter, in an attempt to derail the Turin domestic juggernaut.\n\nIt was first blood Juve at the San Siro last Sunday, as strikes from Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain ended Inter's 100% win-record at the start of the season in Serie A.\n\nMaurizio Sarri's team are a point ahead after seven games, in what looks like being a two-horse race already in Italy's top flight.\n\nGonzalo Higuain grabbed an 80th-minute winner for Juventus at fierce rivals Inter Milan\n\nFrankly though, that's better than the one-way Juventus domination which has made the title something of a foregone conclusion by Christmas for the majority of the past eight years.\n\nA rivalry split by 78 miles, 17 Serie A titles and one 50-year-old manager called Antonio.\n\nNot much in common on the face of it, but let's hope their fight for the title is still a fight for the title come the reverse fixture in March. Serie A needs a threat to Juventus' supremacy, and Inter Milan could be the club to crack it.", "description": "Ahead of the final Serie A weekend before the international break, old wounds were opened up between this year's frontrunners, as Juve appealed for Inter's 05-06 title to be revoked.", "authors": ["Kieran Jackson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/16/19595902-0-image-a-16_1570807469650.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
