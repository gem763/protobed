They got quite excited, so we thought, \u201cwhy don\u2019t we trial the guinea pigs?\u201d\u2018\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe teaching assistant teamed up with learning support worker Lucy Wakefield, 41, to research guinea pigs and the benefits of pet therapy.\n\nThey presented the idea to school leaders, who were initially hesitant about having pets in a school.\n\nHead Paul Kinder said: \u2018As a head, when you hear pets are coming into the school you immediately think twice.\n\n\u2018But Lucy and Helen had done quite a lot of research into pet therapy and the statistical evidence soon convinced me.\n\n\u2018I found out that pet therapy is one of the best ways of reducing stress.\u2019\n\nPaul, 44, added: \u2018There is a well-publicised increase in anxiety among students nationwide.\n\nWe think it\u2019s a great idea (Picture: Warlingham School /SWNS.COM)\n\n\u2018Pet therapy is just one intervention alongside many others that we are now using in response to the issue.\u2019\n\nAfter a day getting settled into the school, the pair were introduced to pupils who queued to meet the furry pair.\n\nPaul added: \u2018The guinea pigs were so popular initially we had to control the viewings so the students did not overwhelm them.\n\n\u2018Things have calmed down now, but stroking the guinea pigs continues to be a really effective way of helping our most anxious pupils.\u2019\n\nLucy, who takes the pets home on the weekends, said: \u2018The therapy sessions are really benefiting the pupils.\n\n\u2018They are much happier, calmer and more able to focus.\u2019\n\nAfter researching the animals, Lucy found out that guinea pigs are best kept in pairs because they like the company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u2018They get on really well and are some of the most friendly guinea pigs you will find.\n\n\u2018Rita is very relaxed. She has a funny way of looking at you. It\u2019s like she is listening.\n\n\u2018Delilah is a bit more inquisitive.\n\n\u2018They both love the attention.\u2019\n\nStaff at Warlingham School are now collaborating with other schools in the area to spread the benefits of the calming practice.\n\nPaul said: \u2018We have an area heads meeting coming up, with mental health leads also attending.\n\n\u2018We will present our experiences there to help promote the guinea pig therapy.\u2019\n\nReflecting on expanding the school\u2019s furry team, Paul added: \u2018We are definitely going to make the trial a permanent aspect of our mental health approach at the school.\n\n\u2018In terms of numbers, I think what we have is working really well for now.\n\n\u2018Come back to me in five years and, we might have 15 goats and a giraffe roaming around.
