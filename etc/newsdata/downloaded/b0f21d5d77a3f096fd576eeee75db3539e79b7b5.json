Pietersen relates that he \u2018gave it my best\u2019 upon being back in the ranks. \u2018I had come to the Caribbean and gone out of my way to make things as smooth as possible for Straussy,\u2019 he insists.\n\nYet within a week of arriving, he was agitating to be allowed home between the third and fourth Tests. The reason: his wife Jessica had chosen to appear in the Dancing On Ice television programme rather than joining other families on tour. Strauss and Flower understandably declined his request.\n\nPietersen in talks with England coach Peter Moores during his first stint in charge in 2008\n\nPietersen with his wife Jessica Taylor on the red carpet at the Pride of Britain awards on Sunday night\n\nWho bullies a bully?\n\nOne of Pietersen\u2019s central claims is that a culture of bullying existed in the England dressing room, particularly among the clique of Matt Prior, James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann.\n\nYet in his book Pietersen is relentless in his contemptuous attitude towards Prior, assassinating his character and constantly ridiculing him with references to his moniker of \u2018Cheese\u2019 or \u2018Big Cheese\u2019, having a go at everything from his on-field attitude to his cycling obsession.\n\nThe scale of abuse he directs at Prior appears to be of a persecuting nature itself.\n\nHow about Pietersen sitting with his mouthpiece Piers Morgan at Lord\u2019s this summer while the broadcaster tweeted about Alastair Cook: \u2018We\u2019re watching you captain weasel.\u2019 Is that not bullying?\n\nWhat about Pietersen\u2019s criticism of batsman James Taylor on his debut at Headingley? He did this both to Andy Flower and his team-mates. He also criticised Michael Carberry, a supposed friend, in Sydney as England plunged to a 5-0 defeat. He asked Jonny Bairstow, in front of the team: \u2018Is there not anybody better than this bloke in county cricket?\u2019\n\nPietersen and Matt Prior celebrate winning the Ashes down under in January 2011\n\nPietersen (right) in the stands at Lord's earlier this year with his friend Piers Morgan (centre)\n\nPetals flowered\n\nThe other main target of vitriol is coach Andy Flower, for whom KP makes no secret of his contempt. He also outlines how he was in two minds about his one-day career and wanted to give it up to achieve a better work-life balance and make his career more manageable.\n\nYet in 2011, at the height of all this discussion, he sent an over-friendly email to Flower opening with the line \u2018Howsit Petals?\u2019 \u2014 the nickname Flower used to have in Zimbabwe, one only really used by southern Africans.\n\nIn the nauseating email he declared an ambition to be one-day captain but only if Flower stayed on as coach so that they could work together \u2014 in contrast to his claim in the book that the pair had not get on \u2018ever since 2009\u2019.\n\nPietersen also calls Flower\u2019s coaching into question. He writes: \u2018I know you are a dreadful coach not by how you won but by how you lost. Your methods created an environment where people became terrified of failing.\u2019\n\nYet the facts do not support the idea that Flower was a bad coach, however poor that last tour of Australia. He took England to No 1 in the world in three forms of the game, winning three Ashes series, one of them away, and achieved an away series win in India, admittedly with Pietersen playing his part.\n\nPietersen with former England coach Andy Flower in the nets at Melbourne in December last year\n\nYou\u2019d Swann off, too\n\nThis week, at one of his public appearances, Pietersen attacked Graeme Swann for quitting the disastrous Ashes tour last winter (but did not do so in his book). According to the batsman \u2018a lot of the players felt aggrieved by him jumping ship in the middle of the series. He let the team down. If it was his elbow, fine, but he could have held on for another couple of weeks\u2019.\n\nYet the document about Pietersen\u2019s behaviour compiled by the ECB, which was leaked this week, suggests that he told a member of the medical staff that if the third Test was lost he would use his knee condition as an excuse to go home. Pietersen denies this, although in 2011 he left the World Cup with a hernia problem that tour staff felt was manageable.\n\nSoon after returning to London he was spotted in a nightclub.\n\nPietersen and Swann celebrate at the end of the fourth test against Australia in Melbourne in December 2010\n\nTempted by IPl riches\n\nPietersen has repeatedly said that he did not wish to prioritise the lucrative Indian Premier League at the expense of his England career, while espousing the IPL\u2019s virtues in his cricket development. He has always said that England was his main concern.\n\nYet he asked to fly to India to play in the IPL semi-finals right in the middle of back-to-back Tests against the West Indies at Lord\u2019s and Trent Bridge in 2012.\n\nDressing room tales\n\nIn a press conference at the start of the Ashes tour last summer, KP declared that the England camp was a place full of harmony, a united place. \u2018We\u2019re all having so much fun. I think we\u2019ll stay friends after cricket,\u2019 he said. \u2018We\u2019ve all grown up and the environment now is absolutely fantastic \u2014 I\u2019m not lying, I\u2019m being dead straight.\u2019\n\nYet in the book he says quite the opposite: \u2018The dressing room had been awful for years. There were wins and star players, but the dressing room was sick all along.\u2019\n\nFirst-class puzzle\n\nPietersen still maintains that it is his wish to play international cricket again and that he hopes certain changes of personnel at the top might help him. \u2018If I was offered the opportunity to play Test cricket again for England I would jump at the chance. I dream of playing for England again,\u2019 he says in the book.\n\nYet this summer, when he was contracted to Surrey, he failed to play a single day\u2019s first-class cricket for the county, apparently disappointing his old mentor Graeme Ford. It was a strange way to push the case that he fervently wanted to play Test cricket again.\n\nKevin Pietersen always claimed that England were his main concern rather than the riches of the IPL\n\nPietersen celebrates with captain Alastair Cook during their Ashes win over Australia last summer\n\nBut their relationship turned sour after Pietersen was sacked from the England team last winter\n\nTweet and sour\n\nKP made much of how the spoof Twitter account @KPGenius upset him and how it led to him breaking down in tears in front of Flower, of all people.\n\nYet Pietersen received requests to stop Piers Morgan tweeting abuse about players, in particular Alastair Cook, to Morgan\u2019s huge audience. When these approaches were made he told his colleagues that they needed a thicker skin.\n\nMemory failure\n\nIn his book Pietersen insists that he cannot remember the wording of the texts he sent about Andrew Strauss in the episode known as \u2018Textgate\u2019.\n\nHe says he sent them to a friend in the South African team and they were just part of ongoing banter with an old mate. Yet he details conversations that were had with others stretching back several years, including quotes in conversations.\n\nPietersen shares a joke with former England captain Andrew Strauss during the India series in 2011\n\nA negative image\n\nAt the end of his autobiography Pietersen asks: \u2018Am I bitter?\u2019 and answers: \u2018No, and no again\u2019, insisting (correctly) that he has much to be proud of.\n\nYet his account of his latter years with England focuses heavily on spats with fellow players and is full of justification for his arguments, giving it an almost joyless tone despite it covering a period when England \u2014 and he himself \u2014 enjoyed plenty of success.\n\nSadly, he dwells on the negative aspects of what happened towards the end of his international career and almost skims over many of his fine achievements.", "description": "PAUL NEWMAN: Kevin Pietersen's autobiography  has seemed to be an endless stream of sad score-settling.
