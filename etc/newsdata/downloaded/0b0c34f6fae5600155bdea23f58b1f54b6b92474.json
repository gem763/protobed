The Washington Times has reviewed thousands of smuggling cases over the last 16 months and found Chinese migrants paying in excess of $50,000 to smuggling organizations to be snuck in trunks or modified fuel tanks, stuffed inside floor boards or fake stereo speakers, and even forced to fit inside car center consoles.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection officers who man the ports of entry regularly report opening glove boxes of cars to find arms, hands or heads sticking up, signaling a migrant has been contorted to fit behind the dashboard. Sometimes the migrants are stuffed in so tightly that the fire department has to be called to come cut them out of the vehicles, in the way they would for crash victims.\n\nOne smuggler in a case last month told authorities he always requested Chinese migrants for his smuggling trips because, authorities recorded him saying, \u201cit is easier to hide smaller subjects in the vehicle.\u201d\n\nAuthorities have not revealed the cause of death of the three migrants in the new case. San Diego police didn\u2019t respond to an inquiry and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement declined to provide information beyond what was in court documents.\n\nProsecutors have charged Mr. Valera with smuggling crimes, including death resulting from smuggling, but have not lodged a homicide charge against him.\n\nMr. Valera pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors asked that he be detained without bail.\n\nICE Homeland Security Investigations agents say Mr. Valera owned the BMW and never reported it stolen. They also have footage of him entering the U.S. through the San Ysidro port of entry on Aug. 9, the same day the vehicle was left on a San Diego street. Neighbors finally reported it to police on Aug. 11, by which time the smell was attracting attention.\n\nWhen police found the car they discovered two female bodies in the trunk. Detectives later realized there was a third body pressed up against the rear wall of the trunk.\n\nThat turned out to be a 15-year-old male, the son of one of the two women.\n\nHSI agents also have another key link \u2014 they detained Mr. Valera\u2019s wife, Nora Gabriela Navarro-Hernandez, a Mexican citizen, when she entered the U.S. last month. Under questioning she said Mr. Valera, 50, told her he was smuggling one illegal immigrant into the U.S. on Aug. 9. He called her as he was at the port of entry waiting his turn.\n\nHe was being paid $5,000 to make the trip, and was told to take his vehicle to a shopping center in Chula Vista, California, where he turned it over to someone else \u201cwith the agreement that the vehicle was to be returned in a timely manner with money placed under the car seat cover,\u201d according to court documents.\n\nAfter Aug. 9, Mr. Valera did continue to cross back and forth over the border but did so on foot.\n\nAuthorities say all three are now positively identified as Chinese. They have a witness who identified one of the women as Ying Lin, 39, from Fujian. Homeland Security has no record of her entering the U.S. legally.\n\nSmuggling migrants through ports of entry can be incredibly lucrative, usually paying even more than driving migrants inside the U.S. who crossed the border themselves.\n\nAccording to data compiled over the last 16 months by The Washington Times, migrants caught being smuggled in vehicles through border crossings paid an average of $16,700, or about twice what migrants who jumped the fence, swam the Rio Grande or otherwise snuck into the U.S. paid to their smugglers.\n\nOf that $16,700, the drivers caught at the border with the migrants in their cars were being paid an average of $3,500 to make the trip.\n\nChinese migrants are particularly hot commodities in smuggling through the ports of entry, with rates of up to $70,000 per person recorded in the court files.\n\nIn Mr. Valera\u2019s case it\u2019s not clear how the migrants died.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
