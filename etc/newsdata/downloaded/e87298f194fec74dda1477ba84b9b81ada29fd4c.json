Photo: Apple TV+\n\nIn 1998, former U.S. poet laureate Billy Collins published a poem called \u201cTaking Off Emily Dickinson\u2019s Clothes.\u201d \u201cI proceeded like a polar explorer,\u201d the poem goes, \u201cthrough clips, clasps, and moorings / catches, straps, and whalebone stays, / sailing toward the iceberg of her nakedness.\u201d When the narrator works his way through all her many layers of clothing and reaches the boundary of her corset, he says, \u201cI could hear her sigh when finally it was unloosed.\u201d\n\nCollins\u2019s image of Dickinson \u2014 strapped into her repressive clothing, standing at her window in silence \u2014 would not be that out of place on Dickinson, a new comedy arriving November 1 on the brand-new Apple TV+ streaming platform. The difference is that in a scene from episode three that\u2019s almost analogous to Collins\u2019s undressing image, Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) stands in front of a mirror and frantically lifts up all her many layers of clothing, her dress and petticoat and underskirt and God knows what else. She finally gets to the bottom-most layer and wails \u201cNoooooooo!\u201d in exaggerated despair, before falling to the floor and dragging herself over to the bed as though her legs have stopped working. Her friend, lover, and soon-to-be sister-in-law Sue (Ella Hunt) rushes over to ask her what\u2019s wrong. \u201cLife is an endless sea of pain!\u201d Emily moans. \u201cI got my period.\u201d\n\nIt was then that I decided I loved Dickinson.\n\nI had been onboard earlier, but it\u2019s hard to get a handle on Dickinson\u2019s tone. It\u2019s part queer teen romance, part silly literary revisionism, part high-school comedy, and part pure absurdism. It\u2019s also yet one more example of what my colleague Bilge Ebiri described as the \u201cWho Fucks Industrial Complex,\u201d a wave of entertainment that works by taking characters like Archie, Nancy Drew, and Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and reimagining them as people with sex lives. They are human beings with functioning endocrine systems. They are people with desires that extend beyond mere hand-holding and an occasional peck on the cheek.\n\nThe inherent appeal of the Who Fucks genre is the way it rehabilitates familiar figures, taking characters who\u2019d been stuck in airless, inhuman stories, and reframing them as fully dimensional, flawed people. It\u2019s related to the superhero-origin-story trend, another way to rewind a particular narrative about who a person is and retell the story in a way that takes trauma or grief more seriously. (Superhero origin stories, for whatever reason, almost never emphasize the Who Fucks element. It\u2019s always Who Broods Endlessly Rather Than Having Productive Conversations With a Therapist.)\n\nThe thing is that not all humanizing looks the same. You only have to look at the space between Dickinson and Billy Collins\u2019s \u201cTaking Off Emily Dickinson\u2019s Clothes\u201d to see two possible poles of difference. In one, Emily Dickinson is a figure to be discovered, and in the other, she\u2019s the one demanding her own power. In Collins\u2019s poem, even thinking of Dickinson\u2019s body is radical. It\u2019s subversive to imagine that she possesses human flesh somewhere underneath her carapace of corsets. In Dickinson, Emily is the one at war with her own embodiment. She\u2019s fascinated by the idea of death, and she\u2019s stuck inside an unruly body that longs for women rather than men and also has to deal with menstruation at a time before ibuprofen or tampons. In Dickinson, Emily can take off her own clothes, thank you very much.\n\nThat\u2019s not a full accounting of what Dickinson is trying to accomplish; it\u2019s so much sillier and weirder than that. Toby Huss wanders around in a nightshirt as Emily\u2019s father, delivering apologies after issuing harsh edicts about inappropriate behavior. Jane Krakowski buzzes around the house as Mrs. Dickinson; by episode three she walks right up to the line of teetering over the edge into fully unhinged, and I hope in future episodes she takes the leap. Meanwhile, Emily\u2019s sister Lavinia (Anna Baryshnikov) is already there. In one of my favorite shots of the first three episodes, Lavinia wonders to herself whether she\u2019s been knitting all day long, and with no further commentary or winking, the scene briefly cuts to an image of a scarf trailing out of the room and down the hallway.\n\nAs illustrated by the scarf gag, Dickinson has a sense of humor that bounces between goofy and grim. Wiz Khalifa appears in Emily\u2019s dreams as a chilled-out, tiny-sunglasses-wearing Death, who rides around in a black carriage with a fully stocked bar. The repeated jokes about Sue\u2019s orphanhood are so bleak it\u2019s easy to misread them as not intentionally jokes (although I\u2019m almost positive they are). In episode three, Jason Mantzoukas has a cameo while Emily is high on opium, and that\u2019s the most I\u2019ll say about that. It is Emily Dickinson by way of Daniel Ortberg, A Knight\u2019s Tale, Gossip Girl, and Daria. If in a future season Cardi B shows up playing Elizabeth Cady Stanton, it would feel entirely appropriate.\n\nThe thing about the Who Fucks Industrial Complex, after all, is that it\u2019s not just about the Who, and it\u2019s definitely not just the sex. It\u2019s also not about accuracy. This Emily Dickinson likely looks as much like the Dickinson of the historical record as Christian Bale\u2019s Batman looks like Adam West\u2019s. It\u2019s not quite the same: Dickinson was a real woman, and reimagining her has different implications than rewriting the backstory of a fictional character. But Dickinson\u2019s not making a claim about literal truth \u2014 the scarf that winds its way several feet down the hallway should be enough to communicate that, if Wiz Khalifa\u2019s Death hadn\u2019t already. It\u2019s making a claim about how we should handle our historical icons, and what their iconography can withstand. We will not lose the beauty of Emily Dickinson\u2019s work if we giggle while imagining her writing it while throwing an epic house party when her parents are out of town.\n\nDickinson is a different kind of origin story, one that co-opts the myth of Emily Dickinson to peel her out of her corset and imagine her as a rebellious queer, goth goofball. She is too death-obsessed to fall into the trap of the blockheaded Badass Feminism in Hulu\u2019s Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and she\u2019s too snide and whiny to be mistaken as a heroic figure. She is Emily Dickinson, messy and horny and smart and very, very fun to watch.", "description": "A review of the new Apple TV+ comedy \u201cDickinson,\u201d starring Hailee Steinfeld as Emily Dickinson, Ella Hunt as her friend, lover, and soon-to-be sister-in-law Sue, Toby Huss and Jane Krakowski as her parents, and Wiz Khalifa as Death.", "authors": ["Kathryn Vanarendonk"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/29/29-dickinson.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
