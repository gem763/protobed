The infant had respiratory problems and was put on a ventilator, according to Alka Sgarna, the medical superintendent who treated her and spoke to CNN. The baby also suffered from an infection and was underweight.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are looking for her parents, and it is possible that they are involved in it,\u201d local police superintendent Abhinandan Singh said at a briefing. \u201cSuch an act is difficult without their involvement. We have deployed police teams, even in civil dress, to trace the suspects.\u201d\n\nHe vowed that authorities \u201cwill take strict action against the culprits.\u201d\n\nInvestigating officer Pradeep Kumar Singh told The Washington Post on Tuesday that nobody had witnessed the girl being buried alive, and noted that the cemetery was located in a rural area and has no closed circuit television.
