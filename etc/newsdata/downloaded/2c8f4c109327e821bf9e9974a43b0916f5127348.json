Be quiet and listen\n\nRegistering and understanding noise is a huge key to helping you win. If you listen closely enough, you can predict what the enemy will do. Likewise, manage your own noise so you don\u2019t make your movements so obvious.\n\nAD\n\nUbisoft developed its own sound propagation system to make the game as realistic as possible. In typical games, you\u2019ll hear a noise from an adjacent room, but it\u2019s muffled. In Siege, noise travels from person to person through space in the shortest way possible, bouncing off walls and entering through doorways.\n\nAD\n\nNiclas \u201cPengu\u201d Mouritzen, flex player for the G2 Esports Siege team, said managing noise is something he and his teammates constantly work on. For example, jumping with your drone is quite loud, making it easy for enemies to track it down and destroy it. Mouritzen cautioned to only jump away if your drone is in danger of being destroyed.\n\nOne tip people don\u2019t think about, Mouritzen said, is that shooting out windows allows you to hear inside. Sound won\u2019t filter through the room unless the window is destroyed. It\u2019s the small things that are make or break in a realistic game like Siege.\n\nAD\n\n2. Learn the maps until you can see them blindfolded\n\nRainbow Six Siege features highly dynamic, destructible, multilevel maps. You can get shot from just about anywhere, which can make it frustrating to play for beginners.\n\nAD\n\nGabriel \u201cLaXInG\u201d Mirelez from Team Reciprocity, who has played competitively for 3\u00bd years, said he had the same issues as many other players in the beginning.\n\nThe classic Siege line of \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could die from there\u201d was a regular occurrence for Mirelez. But the difference between him and many others, he said, was the drive to improve.\n\n\u201cIf you want to improve, you really have to want it,\u201d Mirelez said. Doing the same thing over and over again isn\u2019t going to cut it in a game like Siege.\n\nAD\n\nHe recommends watching professional gameplay and high-level streamers to understand the best angles to take in a map. Keep yourself protected as much as possible while giving yourself the best angle to scope your enemies.\n\n3. Equip the right scope and attachments to fit the occasion\n\nPart of finding success in Siege is knowing which operator fits your situation and play style. More than that, you\u2019ll need to figure out which scopes to use when you are defending or attacking.\n\nAD\n\nThe game narrows down the scopes you can use in particular situations. Attackers and only a few defenders have the option of using ACOG, a scope with 2x magnification, but selecting it all the time isn\u2019t the best option. It forces you to hold and angle and rely on the enemy to make a mistake.\n\nAD\n\nBut in close-quarters combat, Mouritzen said, 1x sights, such as reflex and red dot, are king. They let you take things into your own hands and improve upon fragging (kills). However, if you are playing a support operator such as Thermite, it\u2019s best to hang back and hold down an angle with an ACOG sight.\n\n4. Use the right virtual and physical equipment\n\nIt\u2019s important that you nail down mechanics. In Siege, you\u2019ll need to be able to do a 180 on a dime and shoot first.\n\nYour mouse is the key to it all. It\u2019s important to find a mouse that fits your hand comfortably. That won\u2019t necessarily be the one that the pros are using, Mouritzen said. Sometimes they\u2019re using a mouse that\u2019s part of a sponsorship deal, so it may not work for you.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo calibrate your 180 game, align your mouse at the center of the mouse pad, turn 180 degrees to the left and return back to the center in one quick motion. If you can do that, you should have a good setup, Mouritzen said.\n\nIn addition to your own hardware, there\u2019s the virtual equipment to which each operator character has access. Blitz uses a riot shield that acts as a flashbang, Echo has a quadcopter drone that can disorient people, and Kaid electrifies shields, hatches and barbed wire with his Electroclaw. Understanding how this equipment synergizes with the rest of your team will help you to victory.\n\n5. Stack the odds\n\nTop of mind for the pros is kills, objective, survival rate and trade \u2014 also known as KOST. Some of the terms are obvious, like kills refers to eliminating opponents and the objective is how you approach planting/disarming the bomb or holding an area. Survival rate is about improving your odds at living through an engagement, while trades refer to making opponents pay if they take out one of your teammates. Each of those concepts factors into a player\u2019s decision-making. What this really boils down to, Mouritzen said, is doing whatever it takes to give your team an advantage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf someone kills a teammate, are you able to at least trade the kill? Can you bring in another person to help clear a room? How can you leverage a numbers advantage? It all has to do with odds.\n\nTaking a 50-50 gunfight might work, but it can just as well cost you the game if you lose. That\u2019s probably not a worthwhile fight to pick. Efficient allocation of resources (teammates, drones, grenades, equipment, etc.) given the situation can change the odds to 80-20, the pros say, and help you confidently take a fight.\n\n\u201cClutching is great, but odds are much higher if you match the manpower,\u201d Mourtizen said.\n\nIt\u2019s a team game, after all.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "The game's pros clue in players on some easy ways to put the odds in their favor.", "authors": ["Hawken Miller", "Multiplatform Producer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AId-KrT_4fdX5lXiN60iI-iJds0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NDVVMMSGW5EPTADY3AGHWZL5W4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
