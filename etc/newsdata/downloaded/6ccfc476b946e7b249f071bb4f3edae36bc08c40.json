Puff snacks and other rice-based foods like infant cereal were among the highest levels, with researchers claiming to find \u201cno evidence to suggest that any brand has reduced heavy metals levels in rice to amounts comparable to those in other types of grains, despite at least 10 years of significant public attention to the issue that has included widespread consumer alerts and a proposed federal action level.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the FDA sought to reduce toxins in baby foods, following similar moves by public health advocates and other agencies. As a result, arsenic contamination levels in rice cereal and juice were greatly reduced, but the study\u2019s researchers said more must be done to protect children from potential harm.\n\nPEDIATRIC CANCER COMMUNITY RATTLED BY SHORTAGE OF STAPLE DRUG\n\n\u201cDespite the gains, 19 out of every 20 baby foods tested had detectable levels of one or more heavy metals, according to new tests detailed in this study,\u201d the authors said. \u201cOnly a dramatically accelerated pace at FDA and the fruition of the new Baby Food Council\u2019s pursuit of industry-wide change will be enough to finally solve the problem.\u201d\n\nThe authors suggested five simple swaps in your child\u2019s food to reduce potential harm, such as substituting rice-free snacks for puff snacks or choosing frozen bananas or chilled cucumber over teething biscuits and rice rusks.\n\nThe authors suggested that choosing multi-grain cereal or oatmeal instead of infant rice cereal would lower the baby\u2019s exposure to toxic heavy metals by 84 percent. Switching from fruit juice to tap water, and choosing a variety of fruits and veggies that include carrots and sweet potatoes instead of focusing on carrots and sweet potatoes would also help reduce exposure.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cOur findings raise concerns, but on the spectrum from worry to action, parents can choose to act,\u201d the researchers explained. \u201cWhile no amount of heavy metals is considered safe, less is better, and parents can lower their babies exposures by serving a variety of foods and by following the five safer choices for baby foods provided above.\u201d", "description": "Buying organic or making your own won't prevent exposure either, researchers warned.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/06b1412e-baby_food.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
