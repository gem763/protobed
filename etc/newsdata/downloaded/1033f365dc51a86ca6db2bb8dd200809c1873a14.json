But investor skepticism led to We Company considering earlier this month a potential IPO valuation of as low as $10 billion, Reuters reported.\n\nWe Company had vowed to press ahead with an IPO by the end of the year. But there was little sign that IPO investor sentiment would change, threatening the value of the stakes held not just by outside investors, but by Neumann as well.\n\nWhat was the venture capital world's biggest upset then morphed into one of corporate America's most high-profile boardroom dramas.\n\nSoftBank managed to muster enough opposition to Neumann in a meeting of We Company's seven-member board on Tuesday to convince him to step down. Reuters had reported on Monday that Neumann had engaged in talks about changes to his role.\n\n\"In recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive,\" Neumann said in a statement.\n\nArtie Minson, currently chief financial officer of We Company, and Sebastian Gunningham, a vice chairman for the New York-based start-up, will become co-chief executives, the company said. Neumann will stay on the board as non-executive chairman, the company added.\n\nMinson, a former chief financial officer of Time Warner Cable who joined We Company in 2015, will oversee its finance, legal, human resources, real estate and public communications. Gunningham, a former executive at Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O>, Apple Inc <AAPL.O> and Oracle Corp <ORCL.N> who joined We Company last year, will take responsibility for product, design, development, sales, marketing, technology and regional teams.\n\nWe Company is considering slowing its expansion so it burns through less cash and would require less funding in the absence of an IPO in the near team, Reuters reported on Monday. The company is also contemplating laying off staff, according to a person familiar with the deliberations.\n\n\"While we anticipate difficult decisions ahead, each decision will be made with rigorous analysis, always bearing in mind the company's long-term interests and health,\" Minson and Gunningham wrote in an internal company memo seen by Reuters.\n\nNeumann also agreed to reduce the power of his voting shares, losing majority voting control, according to the sources. Each of his shares will now have the same voting rights as three We Company common shares, not the 10 common shares previously, the sources said.\n\nNeumann's shares used to have the same voting power as 20 We Company common shares, before he agreed to reduce his grip slightly earlier this month in an unsuccessful attempt to make the IPO more attractive to investors.\n\nNeumann's wife Rebekah also found herself without a job at We Company as part of the changes, one of the sources said. She was co-chief brand and impact officer.\n\nShe is also the founder and CEO of WeGrow, an elementary school set up by We Company. However, We Company has decided to do away with such ventures that are not core to the WeWork brand, the source added. We Company declined to comment on Rebekah Neumann's role.\n\nWe Company said on Tuesday it was now evaluating the \"optimal timing\" for an IPO.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIRM GRIP\n\nNeumann, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $2.2 billion, developed a cult following among many We Company employees, vowing to \"elevate the world's consciousness\" as he sought to establish WeWork as a brand that transcended office sharing.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Neumann's dramatic fall from grace came after WeWork parent We Company postponed its initial public offering last week following push-back from prospective investors in its stock, not just over its widening losses but also over Neumann's unusually firm grip on the company.
