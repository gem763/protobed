Photo: Courtesy of TIFF\n\n\u201cI idolize and worship you,\u201d David Copperfield (Dev Patel) says to a woman \u2014 who, in the interest of full disclosure, is decidedly not me \u2014 in Armando Iannucci\u2019s Personal History of David Copperfield. It\u2019s a twee adaptation of Charles Dickens\u2019 book, but Dev Patel is really selling this movie: it\u2019s comedy! Drama! History! Literature! Whimsy! Copperfield goes boom and bust, finds and loses love, misses his mother, hates his stepfather, and teaches Hugh Laurie how to fly a kite \u2014 there\u2019s a lot going on. But that line about idolizing and worshipping something was immediately inscribed into my notebook, because it deeply resonated: Dev Patel\u2019s hair, I idolize and worship you. Dev Patel\u2019s hair, it\u2019s been a long time since Lion and you\u2019ve been missed!\n\nThe Personal History of David Copperfield relies on a lot of whimsy in its retelling of Dickens\u2019 text: Copperfield narrates his early life, sometimes stepping in and out of scenes himself to stand in the background and watch. The sets are technicolor and fantastical: a capsized boat becomes the quaintest little house, an evil extended family is permanently dressed like death herself, scraps of doodles are pasted together to wallpaper entire rooms. The movie follows Copperfield\u2019s birth through his widowed mother\u2019s remarriage through everything that happens after: a decade working in a factory and living with a family of kind-hearted grifters; living with his zany aunt Tilda Swinton and her companion Hugh Laurie, who\u2019s convinced himself that the thoughts of the beheaded King Charles I have traveled into his own mind; reconnecting with his childhood housekeeper; attending finishing school; and getting \u2014 and losing \u2014 a job as a proctor. Copperfield takes on new names amid a revolving door of friends and connections, and has a nutty habit of observing those personalities around him. (Patel does more impressions than an SNL season premiere in this movie, and most of them are pretty good.)\n\nIn the end, Copperfield is a quirky comedy that earns a few genuine guffaws, but it lacks Iannucci\u2019s usual acerbic edge. No matter! Quickly the plot falls away and Copperfield becomes the Dev Patel Hair Show, the finest supporting performance this side of Sandra Oh\u2019s Killing Eve curls: the Lion hair is back to her full glory, and she is booked and busy! Through boom and bust, thick and thin, Gwendoline Christie or Tilda Swinton, Copperfield is really The Hair\u2019s movie. Call her agent, get her top billing! She\u2019s the star.\n\nHow long does it take for The Hair to appear? Approximately .01 seconds: The Hair makes her entrance in the movies third frame. And, oh, is she magnificent: It has been many a day \u2014 perhaps since I first sat in an AMC in Manhattan and saw a little movie called A Star is Born for the first time \u2014 since I\u2019ve lusted over a man\u2019s locks in this way. Chris Pine where? Jackson Maine who? Adam Driver when? Dev Patel has arrived in David Copperfield to reclaim his throne as Thee Mane of Hollywood and who am I to deny him that title, which he has so justly earned?\n\nSometimes the hair blows in the wind when Dev Patel storms off dramatically, stepping into the next home \u2014 and stage \u2014 of his life. Sometimes the hair is as dirty as the soles of Margaret Qualley\u2019s feet in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood! Sometimes \u2014 the best times, some might say \u2014 one dramatic curl dangles right in front of Dev Patel\u2019s perfectly shaped face. It hangs there, loose and free, begging you to push it out of his face and say something incredibly romantic like, \u201cDev Patel, Dickens me down challenge\u201d \u2026 but who\u2019s to say what that curl wants to hear? Sometimes two curls hang out right over his forehead, basically obstructing whatever jokes are coming out of his mouth. Reader: it is, in a word, porn-oh-graphic.\n\nSometimes Dev Patel pulls his hair back \u2014 he\u2019s getting down to business, or declaring a new name for himself \u2014 and I am so happy to report that the hair stays. No mousse, no gel, jus Dev: The heart wants what it wants, but this hair obeys orders. A lot happens in David Copperfield, not all of it especially good, but Armando Iannucci has put Dev Patel\u2019s hair up on that screen.
