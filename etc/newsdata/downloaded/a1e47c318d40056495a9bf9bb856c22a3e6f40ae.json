And then it happened, right in front of me.\u201d\n\nWhat happened with 22 seconds remaining in the 1972 AFC playoff game with Oakland was Terry Bradshaw\u2019s desperation throw to Frenchy Fuqua on fourth down, trailing the Raiders 7-6. Oakland safety Jack Tatum arrived and hit Fuqua from behind as the ball arrived. It ricocheted to Steelers fullback Franco Harris, who made a shoestring catch and headed down the sideline for the winning points.\n\n\u201cIt was a wild scene,\u201d Rooney recalled, a smile creasing his face. \u201cThere were fans running on the field after it was over; I never had experienced that before. Or since.\n\n\u201cOne of our former players, Brady Keys, came over and put me in a bear hug so tight I almost passed out.\u201d\n\nKeys played seven seasons for the Steelers in the 1960s, when they were perennial losers. As Rooney noted this summer, nothing remained the same.\n\n\u201cThat was the turning point, and there is no discussion or arguing that,\u201d he said. \u201cMost franchises may have had a turning point, but they can\u2019t pinpoint it the way the Steelers can. Things changed from that point for the franchise, my grandfather, the city.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather had never had a team win a playoff game. They had never come close for 40 years. He went through some rough sledding.\n\n\u201cFrom there, we won four Super Bowls in the 1970s. That was our era, and the city got a new perception of itself, a self-worth for the people of Pittsburgh. It showed that perennial losers could become winners. It changed the psyche to, \u2018We can do this, too.\u2019\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Part of the lore emanating from the Immaculate Reception is built around Steelers founder Art Rooney heading down to the locker room and missing the greatest play in NFL history.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Barry Wilner"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
