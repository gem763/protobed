DStv Select 2 customers will suddenly have to fork out R519 per month \u2013 a sudden once-off increase of around 96% \u2013 which many existing DStv customers say they simply can't afford.\n\nDStv Select subscribers have complained that they don't know what's going on, can't understand why MultiChoice is taking their package away, and are accusing MultiChoice of not having communicated with them properly. They are saying that they are being forced to now drop DStv as loyal customers because they can't afford the massive subscription fee jump just to continue to watch the channels and shows that they used to get.\n\nMultiChoice stopped offering the DStv Select packages in April 2013 which it started as an offering in conjunction with Vodacom. At the time MultiChoice promised existing DStv Select subscribers that they can remain on DStv Select for as long as they keep paying for it.\n\nOver the past five years MultiChoice took several channels away from DStv Select and didn't replace channels that it terminated with new ones as it does on its other bouquets. It also didn't add any new channels.\n\nYet, DStv Select subscribers kept holding on to their DStv Select subscriptions and for good reason \u2013 the Mzansi Magic and kykNET channels. When MultiChoice terminated its legacy M-Net analogue package, MultiChoice moved those loyal subscribers to a like-for-like DStv service that still included M-Net without making them pay more, but the same isn't happening for DStv Select subscribers.\n\nMultiChoice told DStv subscribers that they will be moved to DStv Family at R265 per month from 29 October 2019. DStv Select subscribers have the option to contact the pay-TV operator and cancel their service altogether or upgrade to a much more expensive package.\n\n\"Your favourite channels are however still available on our various other packages,\" MultiChoice is telling DStv Select subscribers.\n\n\"This is so painful. I have supported DStv and kykNET for many years as a loyal subscriber, but I can't suddenly pay double,\" said a distraught DStv Select subscriber from Port Elizabeth.\n\n\"What about my Binnelanders? Or Boer Soek 'n Vrou? I'm sad. You know what, if this is how DStv is treating loyal customers, they can now take it and shove it if my money isn't enough.\"\n\nMultiChoice was asked in a media enquiry why it is taking kykNET and Mzansi Magic away from customers who have had access to it, how many DStv Select customers MultiChoice has and what same alternative is available for them. MultiChoice was also asked about customers saying that they have not been told or informed about the change and how MultiChoice informed them. MultiChoice didn't answer these specific questions.\n\n\"DStv is continuously reviewing its content line-up, packaging structure and pricing to ensure that customers have access to the best fresh content at great value. As a result, we will be discontinuing some packages and redirecting customers to the main packages where the same programmes and channels can be found,\" the company said in a blanket response to the questions.\n\n\"Select 1 and Select 2 packages will not be available as of 29 October 2019.\"\n\n\"Customers can still watch their much-loved programmes and channels on our other packages. Customers will be migrated to DStv Family, which has 25 more channels than the current package. If they would like to move to any other package, they are welcome to contact us before the package end date.\"", "description": "DStv could soon be losing many loyal customers as they shut down their two DStv Select packages.", "authors": ["Thinus Ferreira"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1378/c4a34036b6bc41a3a421e459ff80aa00.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
