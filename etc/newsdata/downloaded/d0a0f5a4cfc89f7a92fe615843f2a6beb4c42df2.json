In the three days prior to that, it gained a net 11.5%.\n\nLongest Winning Streak Since June\n\nSugar 300-Min Chart - Powered by TradingView\n\nSince hitting a 11-\u00bd month low of 10.68 cents on Sept. 12, sugar has been on a roll, rising in six of out of every 10 sessions.\n\nJust before Thursday\u2019s drop, it hit 12.93 cents, its highest price since the week ended Feb. 24.\n\nThe commodity is also on track to post its third straight weekly rise in the current week, a tally that will give it a gain of more than 16%.\n\nDean Popplewell, analyst at New York-based brokerage OANDA, noted that it would be sugar\u2019s longest winning streak since June.\n\nHe added, primarily citing India\u2019s production deficit:\n\n\u201cSugar is enjoying a bull run amid concerns about tightening global supply. Estimates for the 2020/21 season suggest a shortfall of seven million tons.\u201d\n\nSome Calling Caution...\n\nBut Popplewell also raised some cautionary flags:\n\n\u201cThere are a number of technical resistance points to the upside.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 55-week moving average is at 12.06, the 200-day moving average is at 12.08 and the 100-week moving average is at 12.24.\u201d\n\nInvesting.com has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d recommendation for raw sugar on its Daily Technical Outlook, projecting a resistance as high as 13.11 cents for the December contract.\n\n...Others Greater Highs\n\nHowever, Scoles of RJO Futures made an even higher call:\n\n\u201cYou should note on the chart that last year, at nearly this exact same time, prices fell below 12.50 temporarily, before spiking up from roughly 12.30 to about 14.80 in just 3 weeks.\u201d\n\nSugar has also sealed the highest gains among all commodities over the past month, gaining 16%. In comparison, gold is down almost 1% while oil has lost more than 6%.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: XAU/USD, Gold Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures, US Sugar #11 Futures.
