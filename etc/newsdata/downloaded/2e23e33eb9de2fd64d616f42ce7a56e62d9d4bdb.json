(AP) - Jerry Kelly played bogey-free Sunday at Warwick Hills and closed with a 4-under 68 for a two-shot victory in the Ally Challenge, his second victory this year on the PGA Tour Champions and moving him a little closer to the top of the Charles Schwab Cup standings.\n\nKelly started the final round with a one-shot lead over Schwab Cup leader Scott McCarron and Woody Austin. Only one of them challenged Kelly.\n\nMcCarron fell apart with four bogeys in a five-hole stretch around the turn and shot 75 to tie for 15th. Austin caught Kelly briefly with a birdie on No. 3, but he never could conjure up the vibes at Warwick Hills, where Austin won his first PGA Tour event.\n\nKelly had a pair of birdies on the front nine, and he seized control on the back nine when Austin made bogey on the par-4 15th. Two holes later, on the par-3 17th, Kelly made his final birdie for a three-shot lead.\n\nAustin birdied the 18th and shot 69 to finish alone in second. Steve Flesch (66) and Tim Petrovic (67) tied for third, four shots behind.\n\nKelly also won two months ago in his native Wisconsin at the American Insurance Family Championship. He became the fourth multiple winner this year on the PGA Tour Champions, joining McCarron (three victories), and Steve Stricker and Bernhard Langer (two).\n\nMcCarron still has a big lead in the Schwab Cup. Kelly, who finished at 16-under 200, earned $300,000. He remained at No. 2 in the Schwab Cup, $492,083 behind McCarron with three more events before the PGA Tour Champions\u2019 three-tournament postseason.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019ve got to catch up to Scotty,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something special. He\u2019s been playing great and he\u2019s got a huge lead. All we can do is try and chase him down, try to win tournaments.\u201d\n\nKelly was not a regular during his PGA Tour days, when Warwick Hills was host of the Buick Open.\n\nAustin, however, won the Buick Open in 1995 for his first PGA Tour victory, and it was enough for him to be voted PGA Tour rookie of the year over David Duval. He just didn\u2019t have enough Sunday to track down Kelly.\n\n\u201cI played terrible last year - our first year back - but I still wasn\u2019t going to not come back. It\u2019s a special place,\u201d Austin said. \u201cThis was my first tour win, got me rookie of the year, all that sort of jazz. Just like I said, it wasn\u2019t my time.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jerry Kelly played bogey-free Sunday at Warwick Hills and closed with a 4-under 68 for a two-shot victory in the Ally Challenge, his second victory this year on the PGA Tour Champions and moving him a little closer to the top of the Charles Schwab Cup standings.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
