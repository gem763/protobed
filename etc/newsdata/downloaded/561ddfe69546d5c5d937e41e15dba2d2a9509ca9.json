REUTERS/Christian Hartmann\n\nMakers of the sparkling wine say they have been stockpiling large numbers of bottles across the Channel in their biggest export market, and are confident that the British taste for fizz will be unaffected by any Brexit-related disruption.\n\nPolitical turmoil in the United Kingdom has generated uncertainty over how, when and even whether it will leave the European Union. Its exit date is scheduled for Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cChampagne is champagne, it\u2019s like the Eiffel Tower,\u201d said Pierre-Emmanuel Taittinger, president of the eponymous champagne house, speaking in a vineyard as the grape harvest kicks off in the region. \u201cThe English have loved champagne for 300 years and, Brexit or no Brexit, they will continue to like it, this is something we have no question about.\u201d\n\nThe fall of the pound against the euro due to uncertainty over Brexit was a bigger concern than Brexit itself, Taittinger added.\n\nBritain is champagne\u2019s largest export market, ahead of the United States, with a share of 17%. It imported a volume equal to 26.8 million bottles of champagne in 2018, down from 27.8 million in 2017, data from the Champagne Houses website showed.\n\nMost producers have boosted their shipments to the UK since last year as they prepared for a \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit, which may lead to logistical hurdles or taxes on EU imports.\n\nThe prospect of the country departing without an exit agreement has prompted warnings from opponents of economic turmoil and even food shortages, though the government says such fears are exaggerated.\n\n\u201cGrowers and houses have overstocked in Great Britain to fill a possible border closure if it were to occur,\u201d said Thibaut Le Mailloux, head of communication from the Comit\u00e9 Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne (CIVC), a trade body.\n\nThe group did not say how many extra bottles had been shipped to Britain.\n\nWine critic Antoine Gerbelle said there was enough champagne stockpiled to meet British demand for at least a year.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be a champagne crisis at Christmas,\u201d he said.\n\nSmaller producers could be more exposed to Brexit than big houses as they face tough competition from cheaper sparkling wines such as Italy\u2019s prosecco and Spain\u2019s cava, which have caused a regular fall in champagne exports for more than 10 years.\n\nTaittinger is among France\u2019s largest champagne producers, behind LVMH (LVMH.PA), the world\u2019s biggest luxury group and owner of the Moet & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot champagne labels.\n\nSlideshow (13 Images)\n\nIt is the first French champagne maker to produce sparkling wine in Britain after buying land in Kent, southeast of London, in 2015. The first bottles are expected in 2024.\n\nA drop in demand if free-spending financiers were to quit London\u2019s City financial district did not worry the producer, which sells champagne in 140 countries.\n\n\u201cThe big banker, the big trader, who doesn\u2019t have a job in the City will go to Frankfurt, Paris, New York. The bottle he will not drink in the UK, he will drink elsewhere,\u201d said Taittinger director general Damien Le Sueur.", "description": "Whatever hardships a 'no-deal' Brexit might inflict on Britain a champagne drought will not be one of them, according to French producers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429012734&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0LA", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
