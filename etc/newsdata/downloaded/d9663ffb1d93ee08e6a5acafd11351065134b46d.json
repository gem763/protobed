So while plenty of EDI funding still remains, deferred cash from the program accounts for two out of every five dollars that the administration is diverting to the wall from overseas\u2014raising more questions about Trump\u2019s inconsistent posture on the threat posed by Russia, along with his willingness to support NATO, which he has characterized as a financial burden on the U.S.\n\nThose familiar with the region are now sounding the alarm about what signals the raiding of EDI sends to Russia and to U.S. allies in Europe. \u201cThe signal it sends to Russia,\u201d said a congressional aide, \u201cis that the U.S. isn\u2019t serious about its deterrence initiative for Europe, we\u2019re not serious about our commitment to NATO and to our allies. The messaging is bad, and it\u2019s compounded with all the other bad things Trump has done to harm relations with Europe.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Thedailybeast.Com Trump-Raids-Funds-Meant-To-Deter-Russia-To-Pay-For-His-Wall"], "top_image": ""}
