The class covered how workplaces function and how individuals succeed or fail within them. For the final exam there was an essay question that asked: 'What will you change as a result of being in this class?' I hesitated for a moment and then wrote, 'I will be an extrovert at work.' That is when I decided to change a lifetime of keeping my head down to being more open and authentic in the workplace.\"\n\nHow did it change your life?\n\n\"When I was six, my parents moved me and my sister from New York City to a small town in South Carolina where few people looked like us. This was isolating and disorienting to me throughout my childhood. We were often told, 'Go back to where you came from,' by neighbors, classmates, and even strangers on the street. I often came home crying, and my parents taught me that the bullies win if I showed any reaction, so I should learn to ignore them and focus on school. I learned to keep my head down and avoid confrontation. I threw myself into achieving academically throughout school and into college, and then as I took a job at Boston Consulting Group. But what worked for me up until that point stopped working. We were expected to build relationships with our clients and make a positive impression with our presence; being the best analyst without those skills meant failure in the consulting field. After two years there, I went to Stanford GSB and encountered this test question of what I would do differently. I knew I had to learn to find my voice, or I risked failing in my career. So I decided then and there to become an extrovert at work. This completely changed the course of my career. I learned to speak with my authentic voice, and it led me to Silicon Valley, where I have built products that have touched hundreds of millions of people in the world. Without the GSB class, I would never have had the courage to advocate for building Marketplace at Facebook, a product where millions of people connect each month to buy and sell and create their livelihoods. I'm grateful I had a chance to get this advice early in my career, as it has changed my entire outlook and trajectory.\"", "description": "Business Insider asked alumni from distinguished business schools to share the most useful thing they learned while getting their degree.", "authors": ["Robin Madell"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cddac08021b4c133c0e8e87-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
