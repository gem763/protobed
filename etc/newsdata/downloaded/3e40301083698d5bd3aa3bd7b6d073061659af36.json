In the second period of Thursday\u2019s season-opening loss to Boston at home, Polak went into the boards when he tried to check Chris Wagner about midway through the second period.\n\nAfter hitting the boards with his left shoulder and head, the 33-year-old Polak was face-down on the ice for several minutes before being rolled off on a stretcher. He was evaluated at a hospital.\n\nPolak\u2019s injury was the third of the game for the Stars. Forward Blake Comeau will be out several weeks with a lower-body injury after falling awkwardly when he was hit in the face by a puck. Forward Jason Dickinson will be out at least a week with an upper-body injury.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Stars defenseman Roman Polak has a small fracture in his sternum and will be re-evaluated next week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/bruins_stars_hockey_44765_c0-96-4561-2755_s1770x1032.jpg?67a5f86e3d8a5c8c0ed3cfa53e72b3c193ae451d", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
