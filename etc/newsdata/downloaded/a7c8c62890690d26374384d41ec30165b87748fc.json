The committee would be taking \u201cthe first step on the political path out of the tragedy of the Syrian conflict\u201d, he said in a statement.\n\nThe committee\u2019s 150 members \u2014 including government, opposition and civil society delegates \u2014 start work on Wednesday.\n\nBut some experts argue that it will merely offer yet another opportunity for President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government to appear open to UN-backed diplomacy without giving anything away.\n\nAssad \u201chas nothing to lose,\u201d at the talks, Aaron Lund of the Century Foundation told AFP.\n\n\u201cIf the process turns unpleasant for some reason, it\u2019s no big deal. He\u2019ll just make up some technical reason to stall it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018New\u2019 constitution? \u2013\n\nOnce all the delegates have gathered for the opening ceremony at the UN, 45 of them will begin working on a draft constitution.\n\nPedersen said the aim would be to reach consensus on all issues.\n\nWhere that was not possible, changes would only be made with a 75-percent majority vote in the committee to avoid having any one side dictate the process.\n\nBut the prospects of consensus appears remote.\n\nWhile the opposition has called for an entirely new text, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem argued that amending even one article of the current charter would amount to a \u201cnew constitution\u201d.\n\nDamascus has also insisted that the process have no deadline.\n\nThe Assad government may agree to a few amendments, International Crisis Group senior analyst Sam Heller told AFP \u2014 but a \u201ccompletely rewritten\u201d constitution appeared impossible.\n\nDamascus only agreed to join the Geneva meeting at the urging of its Russian allies, he argued.\n\nWhile Moscow pursued Syrian diplomacy outside of the UN-umbrella, it always maintained that a solution to the conflict had to earn the UN stamp of approval.\n\nConstitutional review is a central part of the UN-led effort to end the war in Syria, which has killed more than 370,000 people and forced millions to flee their homes since 2011.\n\nSecurity Council resolution 2254, which defines the UN push for peace, also calls for UN-supervised elections in Syria.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Dirty little deals\u2019 \u2013\n\nWhile Assad\u2019s forces have steadily made gains against the opposition, his cash-strapped government is still hit by EU and US sanctions. It desperately needs funds to rebuild the war-ravaged country.\n\nRussia has repeatedly called for the international community to unlock Syrian redevelopment funds.\n\nOpposition negotiators warned last month that Assad could use its participation at the constitutional review as a \u201ccard\u201d to press its case for financial aid.\n\n\u201cIf it turns out there\u2019s an opportunity to use this (constitutional) forum to unlock new opportunities and normalise ties with the international community, (Assad) will do that,\u201d Lund said.\n\n\u201cWhat the constitutional committee can do, at best, is to put a gloss of international legitimacy on whatever dirty little deals may be hashed out behind the scenes.\u201d", "description": "Geneva (AFP) \u2013 Syria\u2019s government may be on board for the UN-brokered review of its constitution, but it will sink the Geneva talks opening", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/3cc1bb_constitutional-review-is-central-un-led-effort-end-war-in-syria-has-killed-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
