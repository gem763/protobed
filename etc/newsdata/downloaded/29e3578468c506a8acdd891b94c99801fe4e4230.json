I myself follow a plant based diet because of it, but it's interesting that you [XR spokesman Rupert Read] talk about the methods.\n\n'For me, a load of people dancing in a street probably off their head and dreadlocks, soap-dodgers...'\n\nXR spokesman Rupert Read shook his head while Question Time host Fiona Bruce cut the audience member off saying: 'You may be maligning a whole group of people there, I would just like to say.'\n\nXR spokesman Rupert Read (right) shook his head while Question Time host Fiona Bruce (left) cut the audience member off saying: 'You may be maligning a whole group of people there, I would just like to say'\n\nBut the man continued: 'I think it's the wrong type of people who are putting out this message.\n\n'There is a real argument for the environment and its completely painting the wrong picture and as Theo said it's stopping people going to work, it's causing normal people problems.\n\n'And it shouldn't be, it should be a problem that we all adopt and we all change our regular lifestyles for and I think when you know you see these people dancing in the street it's not a protest, it's just a field day.'\n\nBut the man continued: 'I think it's the wrong type of people who are putting out this message'\n\nHe added: 'And i think it's really important we make this a proper issue and not make it look stupid.'\n\nYesterday's action saw XR protesters shut down the Burger King store and create security problems at City Airport.\n\nEco-activists forced the fast-food chain to shut its doors by staging a sit-in in Leicester Square while chanting a protest song with a call to 'shut this system down'.\n\nOne man with a megaphone railed against deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, while another held up a sign saying: 'RIP 10 million pigs'.\n\nOther protesters gathered on Lambeth Bridge with a banner demanding 'Tell The Truth', watched by police officers on motorcycles.\n\nProtesters block the entrance to London City Airport from the Docklands Light Railway station during Thursday's protests\n\nA Scotland Yard spokesman said late last night 1,112 people had been arrested over the four days of protests, which are set to continue today and are scheduled to last two weeks.\n\nMeanwhile there were questions asked at City Airport after a protester climbed on top of a British Airways plane and glued himself down while another plane was forced to turn around on the tarmac.\n\nJames Brown, a partially-sighted Irish cyclist who was banned from athletics in 2016 for a doping violation, was able to circumvent security at London City Airport by buying a boarding pass.\n\nThat allowed him to get through the relevant security checks that are prevalent at any UK airport and board a flight he had no intention of taking.\n\nMet Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick slammed Brown saying it was a 'stupid and dangerous thing to do' adding there will now be a full security review into the incident.", "description": "The man (pictured) hit out at 'soap-dodgers' dancing in the streets of central London and called for the activists to 'make it a proper issue and not make it look stupid'.", "authors": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/08/19576572-0-image-a-12_1570779792319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
