Thankfully, it healed the wound in a couple of days.\n\nOwner Michaela took care of Twinkle when she came across the kitty while walking her dogs (Picture: PA Real Life/Bryce Groves)\n\n\u2018Twinkle would have been put down if it wasn\u2019t for this bottle of baby oil,\u2019 explained Michaela.\n\n\u2018I knew we had to do something soon, or else the area would get too infected and she\u2019d have no quality of life.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t want to use the harsh chemical-filled things vets had suggested on her delicate fur, but she loved the oil, which has natural ingredients.\n\n\u2018After two days, the black, dead skin around the abscess was already healing, and Twinkle loved having it applied. She\u2019d even stick her leg in the air for me. It was lovely and soothing for her.\u2019\n\nTwinkle cannot move her back legs, and so gets around by shuffling along with them behind her (Picture: PA Real Life/Bryce Groves)\n\nThough Twinkle is doing much better, it was an upward battle when Michaela first found her.\n\n\u2018She was a tiny little thing, only around two-or-three weeks old,\u2019 she said. \u2018I could see she was very injured and whimpering in pain.\n\n\u2018If she was a fighter, she\u2019d fight, and if she wasn\u2019t, we would have to let her go.\n\n\u2018The first month was just about keeping her as still and quiet as possible. A stressed animal would not have healed.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce Twinkle recovered, she had to get used to her paralysed back legs, dragging them behind her.\n\nTo help them grow stronger, Michaela did a special massage called TTouch \u2013 designed to stimulate the nerves \u2013 twice a day.\n\nTwinkle even has a special pair of kitty trousers to wear outside.\n\nTwinkle was almost put down when her anal sac ruptured \u2013 until her owner discovered an \u00a311.99 bottle of baby oil that saved her (Picture: PA Real Life/Bryce Groves)\n\nBut in April 2019, disaster struck when her anal sac ruptured, which Michaela believes was a result of dragging herself across the floor.\n\n\u2018I had tried to keep her from lying on her wound, but she\u2019s a wily little thing,\u2019 she added.\n\nIn the next few weeks, Michaela had to feed Twinkle antibiotics and keep her clean which was no easy feat. If she didn\u2019t get beter, she\u2019d sadly have to be put down.\n\nMichaela was desperate not to give up on Twinkle and decided to check out her local Holland & Barrett store, where the manager suggested she try a product from the human baby section called Balmonds Chamomile Baby Oil.\n\nShe began to apply the oil using cotton wool, which worked like magic on her infected skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time Twinkle was supposed to go back to the vet to potentially be put to sleep, she was virtually back to normal.\n\n\u2018I was flabbergasted,\u2019 said Michaela. \u2018Something meant for changing a baby\u2019s bottom had cured my cat.\n\nThe kitty is doing much better now(Picture: PA Real Life/Bryce Groves)\n\n\u2018I now want everyone to know about this, even vets, so that they don\u2019t always have to prescribe harsh, chemical-filled products as there are alternatives.\u2019\n\nA bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Twinkle is now back to her usual antics and living her best life.\n\nMichaela added: \u2018She really is fearless. She may be half the size of a normal cat, but she has twice the character.\u2019\n\nMORE: Meet Pooh, the rescue cat with brand new prosthetic legs\n\nMORE: Woman rescues 27 paralysed dogs including Elton John who is \u2018still standing\u2019\n\nMORE: Cats love their owners just as much as dogs do, study finds\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Animal behaviourist Michaela Lanarth saved Twinkle the kitten who sadly had her anal sac ruptured as a result of dragging her paralysed legs.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_91138242_1571737688.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
