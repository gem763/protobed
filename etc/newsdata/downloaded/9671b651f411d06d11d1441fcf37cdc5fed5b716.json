Photo: Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s five-decade career in politics is a goldmine for political opponents or concerned voters looking to dig up quotes that have aged poorly, or were extremely bizarre in the first place. Though the excavation, thus far, has mostly concerned his worrisome policies and talking points involving busing in the 1970s, a deeply weird video from 2017 is now making a run, after Michael Harriot, a senior writer at the Root, analyzed the unlikely race dynamic at play in a meandering anecdote about a pool confrontation from the summer of 1962.\n\nIn this entry into the overstuffed genre of guys talking about fights they almost got into, Biden recalled the days when he was a lifeguard for a public pool in a black neighborhood in Wilmington, Delaware. Speaking onstage at a 2017 ceremony in which the city named the pool after him, Biden described an interaction in which he called out a \u201cbad dude\u201d nicknamed Corn Pop \u2014 the leader of a local gang called the Romans \u2014 when he was bouncing high off the diving board. \u201cEsther Williams,\u201d Biden yelled to Corn Pop, referring to the synchronized swimmer and Hollywood actress. \u201cGet off the board, man. You\u2019re out of here.\u201d It gets stranger from there.\n\nThis is BIZARRE!\n\nHere's Joe Biden telling the story of his face-off with a gang of razor-wielding ne'er-do-wells led by a guy named 'Corn Pop.' pic.twitter.com/DddRtWgdza \u2014 Eddie Zipperer (@EddieZipperer) September 15, 2019\n\nThe former vice-president telling a story about a near-rumble with very \u201960s weapons \u2014 surrounded onstage by confused children \u2014 is very clearly a strange encounter. In the context of a primary in which critics are concerned over Biden\u2019s ability to maintain focus in his speeches, the video carries new weight. And for Michael Harriot, the Corn Pop encounter is a perfect anecdote for the \u201cimaginings of white people as it relates to race. Many of them have this fictionalized jigaboo version that is almost alien-like.\u201d\n\nHarriot is also doubtful that any of it happened, due to the details which sound like \u201csome white kid tried to make a gang fairy tale for a sixth-grade play.\u201d But in an example of really owning the beat, CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale provided the 2016 obituary of a Wilmington 73-year-old named William \u201cCorn Pop\u201d Morris, and got in touch with former Wilmington Mayor Dennis Williams who confirmed that \u201cthis is the CornPop of the Biden incident.\u201d The good news for the Biden campaign regarding the exhumation of this odd video is that voters know the front-runner is ready to handle himself in a political street fight if the primary starts to get ugly.", "description": "Over the weekend, an odd video emerged of Joe Biden describing a 1962 encounter involving a pool, a man named Corn Pop, and some straight razors.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/12/biden_cornpop.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
