Disney unveiled the promo for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker during Monday Night Football. Watch the trailer above.\n\nThe trailer reveals plenty of new footage suggesting an epic sweep amid voiceover from several characters \u2014 including, for the first time, the return of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). \u201cLong have I waited,\u201d Palpatine intones as we see footage of a skeletal throne. \u201cAnd now your coming together\u2026 is your undoing.\u201d\n\nThere are shots of Rey running through a forest, new clips of Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren\u2019s (Adam Driver) stand-off on what fans suspect is wreckage of the Death Star amid a stormy sea, a tantalizing shot of Rey and Kylo once again teaming up, the rebel team gunning down stormtroopers, and an ominous clip of C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) \u201ctaking one last look at my friends.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also voiceover from Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) from beyond: \u201cConfronting fear is the destiny of a Jedi. Your destiny.\u201d\n\nFor more analysis, check out our deep-dive breakdown of every major shot in the trailer.\n\nTickets were also put on sale for the film at theaters nationwide.\n\nThe film seeks to bring about a conclusion of not just the current Disney-produced Star Wars trilogy, but the previous six Episode titles as well. \u201cThis is about bringing this thing to a close in a way that is emotional and meaningful and also satisfying in terms of actually answering [as many] questions as possible,\u201d director J.J. Abrams tells EW in its November issue. \u201cSo if years from now, someone\u2019s watching these movies, all nine of them, they\u2019re watching a story that is as cohesive as possible.\u201d\n\nThe film marks the return of Abrams to a galaxy far, far away and also stars Carrie Fisher, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Naomi Ackie, Domhnall Gleeson, Richard E. Grant, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Keri Russell, Joonas Suotamo, Kelly Marie Tran, and Billy Dee Williams.\n\nThe Rise of Skywalker opens Dec. 20.\n\nRelated content:", "description": "The Emperor speaks in spectacular final trailer for 'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker'", "authors": ["James Hibberd"], "top_image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/tros_3-1.jpg?crop=314px%2C0px%2C2371px%2C1244.775px&resize=1200%2C630", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
