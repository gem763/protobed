Presented by\n\nA recent flap over VP Mike Pence\u2019s Irish lodging backs up some of the what\u2019s-going-on-with-the-VP talk that is so pervasive in some corners of the Trump universe. | Charles McQuillan/Getty Images\n\nANOTHER ONE GONE \u2026 Texas GOP Rep. BILL FLORES will not seek reelection. He was pretty unhappy last Congress, and considered leaving last term, we discovered when reporting for our book last cycle. Flores was the Republican Study Committee chairman as that conservative caucus waned in power. Flores\u2019 district, the Texas 17th, is an R+12, which he won by 15 points in 2018. President DONALD TRUMP won the district, which includes Waco, by 17 points in 2016. (FWIW: Flores didn\u2019t give many senior D.C. Republicans a heads-up on this, but few were surprised.) More from Melanie Zanona\n\n-- THE FACE OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE is changing. The face of Texas is definitely changing -- Flores is the fifth House R from the state to announce he\u2019s done with Congress. And the 12 retirements so far will likely make it tougher for the GOP to take back the House.\n\n-- ALL EYES on NC-9 for a serious gut check six days from today.\n\nWHAT IS UP WITH THE VP? \u2026 On Tuesday, WaPo\u2019s Bob Costa -- the print pooler for this VP MIKE PENCE trip to Europe -- was among the reporters who spoke to MARC SHORT, the VP\u2019s chief of staff, and asked him why the vice president was staying at the Trump Hotel in Doonbeg, Ireland, instead of Dublin, where the VP needed to be for official business. Dublin is nearly 300 kilometers from Doonbeg.\n\nSHORT -- who has spent his career working in politics, and for many years in very close proximity to Pence -- said these words: \u201cIt\u2019s like when we went through the trip, it\u2019s like, well, he\u2019s going to Doonbeg because that\u2019s where the Pence family is from. It\u2019s like, \u2018Well, you should stay at my place.\u2019\u201d\n\nMY PLACE, meaning the president\u2019s hotel. Meaning the leader of the free world -- who is higher than Pence on the food chain, and is known to demand loyalty -- suggested he stay at that hotel.\n\nNOW, Pence\u2019s team is having to clean this up.\n\nHERE\u2019S Costa\u2019s pool report from this morning: \u201cOf note: Late Tuesday, VP\u2019s office put out a statement from a spokesperson to \u2018clarify the decision to stay at Trump National in Doonbeg,\u2019 stating, in part, that it was \u2018solely a decision by the Office of the Vice President and was based on the requirement to find accommodations near the vice president\u2019s ancestral hometown that could satisfy official meetings on both coasts of the Emerald Isle.\u2019\n\nTHE STATEMENT ADDED that \u2018At no time did the president direct our office to stay at his Doonbeg resort and any reporting to the contrary is false.\u2019 For the complete statement and further questions on that front, contact the VP\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nTHE REPORTING was based on on-the-record remarks from the VP\u2019s chief of staff, which indicated quite clearly that Pence\u2019s superior suggested he stay at his hotel. The VP\u2019s team was peeved that some people reported that Pence was \u201cdirected\u201d to stay there. But it seems obvious that he heeded the suggestion of a president who appreciates his suggestions heeded.\n\nNEXT STOP \u2026 PENCE is in Iceland, and then going to London in the middle of a government crisis there.\n\nTHIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE of \u2026 interesting trips by the VP. Others included a much-maligned visit to a border facility back in July, and another that almost put him in contact with a man who was about to be arrested on criminal drug charges (it was canceled). That\u2019s not to say Pence is not an effective surrogate domestically (he\u2019s been the face of the USMCA, the president\u2019s trade deal with Canada and Mexico) and internationally. But this does back up some of the what\u2019s-going-on-with-the-VP talk that is so pervasive in some corners of the Trump universe.\n\nISRAEL CHANNEL 13/AXIOS\u2019 @BarakRavid: \u201cBREAKING: Netanyahu to travel to London tomorrow to meet Boris Johnson and US SecDef Mark Esper\u201d\n\n-- NETANYAHU canceled a one-day visit to India that was scheduled for Sept. 9.\n\nGood Wednesday afternoon.\n\nA message from Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women: Since 2008, Goldman Sachs has trained and empowered women business owners in developing economies through our 10,000 Women program, with 70% of graduates reporting higher revenues and nearly 60% creating new jobs in their communities.

Others believed their parents had abandoned them and were angry and confused. \u2026 The report is the first substantial accounting by a government agency on how family separation under the Trump administration\u2019s \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 policy has affected the mental health of children.\u201d AP \u2026 The report\n\nALEX PANETTA and MARK SCOTT: \u201cUnlike U.S., Canada plans coordinated attack on foreign election interference\u201d: \u201cCanada spent the last three years developing the most detailed plan anywhere in the Western world to combat foreign meddling in its upcoming election. But with the country\u2019s national campaign to begin in a matter of weeks, one question remains: Will the efforts pay off?\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government passed new transparency rules last year for online political ads that run on platforms including Facebook and Twitter \u2014 further than what\u2019s required in the U.S. It ordered the country\u2019s usually tight-lipped intelligence services to go public about foreign threats. Canada also housed a G-7 project to share the latest intelligence between allies about possible foreign disinformation and created a non-partisan group to warn political parties and the public about outside interference. \u2026 [L]essons from its upcoming nationwide vote will prove essential for U.S. policymakers.\u201d POLITICO\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

Balash, who had served as the Interior Department\u2019s assistant secretary for land and minerals management for nearly two years, confirmed in a phone interview Tuesday night that he will begin working for the Papua New Guinea-based Oil Search, which is developing one of Alaska\u2019s largest oil prospects in years.\n\n\u201cThe company is drilling on state lands that lie nearby \u2014 but not inside \u2014 two federal reserves where the Trump administration is pushing to increase oil and gas development: the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. During his time at Interior, Balash oversaw the department\u2019s work to hold lease sales on the coastal plain of the 19.3 million-acre refuge and to expand drilling on the 22.8 million-acre reserve to the west of the refuge.\u201d WaPo\n\nPUNDIT PREP \u2026 PRE-CLIMATE FORUM READING -- \u201cCalifornia raises the caution flag on \u2018green jobs,\u2019\u201d by Debra Kahn in San Francisco: \u201cCalifornia\u2019s mixed record of using public investments and environmental mandates to create \u2018green jobs\u2019 raises serious questions about the promises of some Democratic presidential candidates to use economy-transforming investments in environmentally friendly technologies to put millions of people to work. \u2026\n\n\u201cAs California's experience shows, reality doesn't always live up to projections. And while some of the most conservative estimates, like [Elizabeth] Warren's and [Tom] Steyer's, appear reasonable based on California\u2019s record, the state\u2019s experience also reveals just how modest \u2014 and unimpressive \u2014 those goals would be for a 10-year period. \u2026 California\u2019s experience is that jobs have materialized, but that it\u2019s been more trouble than it\u2019s worth to count them in the aggregate.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cHow Kamala Harris would address climate change,\u201d by Anthony Adragna: \u201cCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris on Wednesday released her plan for addressing climate change, calling for $10 trillion in public and private funding to create a carbon-neutral economy and invoking her past as a prosecutor to target companies that are driving greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d POLITICO \u2026 The plan\n\n-- \u201cHow Pete Buttigieg would tackle climate change,\u201d by Kelsey Tamborrino: \u201cButtigieg's plan tracks with some other 2020 Democratic hopefuls' proposals with its focus on farmers and disadvantaged communities, and by setting a goal for net-zero emissions by 2050. But the plan differs from some by calling for an economy-wide carbon price and by targeting a \u2018thriving\u2019 carbon removal industry by 2040.\u201d POLITICO \u2026 The plan\n\nA HEADLINE THE PRESIDENT WILL LIKE -- WSJ: \u201cU.S. Trade Gap Narrowed in July as Imports Fell,\u201d by David Harrison and Paul Kiernan\n\nBOOK WATCH -- \u201cMattis\u2019s former speechwriter faces warning from Pentagon as he prepares book, memos show,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Dan Lamothe: \u201cThe Pentagon has warned former defense secretary Jim Mattis\u2019s onetime speechwriter that he could face \u2018a range of potential consequences\u2019 if he reveals classified information in a forthcoming book or unclassified details that defense officials determine violate \u2018the trust\u2019 of Mattis, according to letters and memos obtained by The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cRetired Navy Cmdr. Guy Snodgrass, who worked for Mattis for 17 months and retired in August 2018, has sued the Defense Department, alleging that the Pentagon has imposed prior restraint on his book by dragging out a review of his manuscript for months. The department \u2018deliberately failed to fulfill its lawful obligations\u2019 and has imposed \u2018inappropriate and legally inapplicable requirements\u2019 on Snodgrass, the lawsuit argues.\u201d WaPo\n\nVALLEY TALK -- \u201cGoogle\u2019s YouTube hit with $170M fine over children's privacy,\u201d by Margaret Harding McGill: \u201cThe Federal Trade Commission and New York's attorney general on Wednesday slapped a $170 million fine and other sanctions on Google-owned YouTube over its handling of children's data, in the latest government crackdown on the tech industry's business practices.\n\n\u201cThe settlement resolves allegations that YouTube violated a federal children's online privacy law by tracking kids under 13 years old without their parents' consent, and serving targeted advertisements to them. Under a consent decree, YouTube will require users to self-identify whether videos they upload are meant for children, obtain parental consent before collecting personal information about kids and provide its employees with annual training on how to comply with the children's privacy law.\u201d POLITICO\n\n2020 WATCH -- NYT\u2019S REID EPSTEIN in Cedar Rapids, Iowa: \u201cLife Off the Democratic Debate Stage: Sparse Crowds, Daily Indignities\u201d: \u201cNot many people know who they are.

Matt Rhoades, the Republican operative who ran Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, is leaving Definers to become the co-chief executive of CGCN Group, a lobbying firm with ties to President Donald Trump\u2019s White House and Republicans in Congress.\n\n\u201cRhoades is bringing a number of Definers staffers with him, including Antonia Ferrier, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Meanwhile, Joe Pounder, the GOP operative who co-founded Definers with Rhoades in 2015, has bought out Rhoades\u2019 stake in Definers and has rebranded the firm as Bullpen Strategy Group.\u201d POLITICO\n\nBEYOND THE BELTWAY -- \u201cMichigan Governor Bans Sale of Flavored E-Cigarettes,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Mitch Smith: \u201cGov.
