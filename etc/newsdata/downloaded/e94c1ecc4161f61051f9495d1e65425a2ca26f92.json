And speaking of insects where is \u2018America\u2019s Mayor\u2019? Shouldn\u2019t Rudy be fighting for these people? pic.twitter.com/3UN4daIain \u2014 Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) June 13, 2019\n\nIt is not the first time that Carrey, whose artwork has in recent years become an integral part of his persona, has attacked Guiliani. In June, he described Guiliani as an \u201cinsect\u201d over his failure to champion compensation and benefits for first responders to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, Carrey has also attracted attention for his controversial, gruesome, and even violent drawings depicting Donald Trump, Republicans, and other political figures with whom he disagrees.\n\nThe 56-year-old actor has previously explained that his artwork is his personal way of dealing with the \u201cpain\u201d inflicted on him by the Trump administration, which he believes is \u201cpushing the country towards suffering beyond all imagination.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel feelings, and that\u2019s the only way I can deal with them is to turn them into something positive,\u201d the Sonic the Hedgehog star explained. \u201cAll pain equals art.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "New York Magazine\u00a0has\u00a0published\u00a0politically charged artwork by far-left actor Jim Carrey of Rudy Guiliani as a Frankenstein-looking monster.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/12/ZombieCarrey1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
