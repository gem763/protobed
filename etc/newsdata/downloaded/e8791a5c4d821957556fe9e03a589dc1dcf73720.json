They\u2019re more than ready to see this as the occasion.\u201d\n\nSexton then reiterated the need for the media to \u201cassert pressure\u201d on Trump \u201cto resign so we can avoid this story going to a place that risks lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have already died,\u201d he stated. \u201cMore will if this crisis isn\u2019t dismantled carefully.\u201d\n\nNow, Campus Reform later interviewed Sexton, and his comments there perhaps (and only perhaps) seem like a bit (but only a bit) of a walkback from his original tweets \u2014 although he certainly did double down on his view that Trump is \u201cdangerous.\u201d In the interview, though, Sexton clarified that he doesn\u2019t believe that people will \u201cdie simply because Trump remains in office,\u201d but that he does \u201cbelieve there is a danger in President Trump and Republicans continually mentioning coups and civil wars as history, both recent and past, shows that individuals do kill when rhetoric like this permeates media.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor instance, Dylann Roof\u2019s killings were predicated by radicalizing propaganda that told him he must take his country back,\u201d he told the news source.\n\nStory continues\n\n(President Obama, not Trump, was in office at the time of Roof\u2019s murders.)\n\n\u201cMy concern is that the President has obviously committed impeachable offenses and that the fight over impeachment, considering there [are] already calls for a civil war, will be dangerous for Americans,\u201d Sexton continued.\n\nOkay. First of all, let me just say that I am certainly not someone who thinks that Donald Trump is perfect. For example, as a pro-immigration libertarian, I couldn\u2019t agree less with his views on that issue \u2014 such as his desire to spend taxpayer money building a wall (no matter how \u201cbeautiful\u201d he assures me it would be). What\u2019s more, I believe that he\u2019s said things that warrant criticism, and have not been hesitant to offer my own. In fact, like Sexton, I was also bothered by his tweet predicting that there would be a \u201cCivil War\u201d should he be impeached.\n\nHere\u2019s the difference, though: Despite having my own issues and concerns regarding the president, I have always managed to remain at least hinged in my criticism of him. For example: I have never even insinuated that he was a murderer, as Sexton did in his tweets. Now, of course, it\u2019s been easy for me to refrain from doing so \u2014 because I myself happen to find such statements to be patently ridiculous and rooted in hysteria and prejudgments rather than in fact. For example (as I discussed in my column yesterday) last spring, CNN, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Washington Post, and Vox all ran stories on a single study reporting a 226 percent increase in hate-related incidents in connection to Trump\u2019s rallies. Without looking into context or alternative explanations for the numbers, Democratic politicians from Representative Ilhan Omar to Senator Bernie Sanders weighed in to use the study as unequivocal evidence that Trump\u2019s rhetoric was absolutely causing hatred and violence. When reporters for Reason looked into the numbers, however, they found that Hillary Clinton actually had an even higher increase in hate incidents related to her rallies \u2014 ultimately concluding that the increase that had been categorically blamed on rhetoric was actually more than likely due to the fact that politicians often choose to hold rallies in larger cities, where \u201cthe raw number of crimes is generally mechanically higher.\u201d\n\nAll things considered, people like Sexton may want to contemplate being more measured in their own rhetoric when discussing Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 not for me, not for Trump or his supporters, but for themselves. Aside from the fact that a Trump resignation is quite obviously never going to happen under any circumstances (seriously, I\u2019d bet my cat against it) speaking in clear, hysterical hyperbole is never the way to win anyone over to anything. Although it may energize the hard Left, talk of Trump being a murderer or \u201cliterally Hitler\u201d or the like sounds like overblown nonsense to everyone else. The problem, of course, with people hearing you spew what they consider to be nonsense is that they\u2019re going to be far more likely to write you off even when you may have a legitimate point. What\u2019s more, that sort of talk makes Trump supporters further view the president as a victim, constantly being scourged with the lashes of outrageous allegations. You may be trying to push people away from Trump, but all you end up doing is pushing his supporters further toward him.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "A\u00a0 professor at Georgia Southern University has declared that \u201cpeople have already died\u201d because of Donald Trump -- adding that the media must pressure him to resign or else \u201cdangerous individuals\u201d will \u201ckill and maim.\u201dA linguistics and writing professor, Jared Yates Sexton, made the comments on Twitter", "authors": ["Katherine Timpf"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
