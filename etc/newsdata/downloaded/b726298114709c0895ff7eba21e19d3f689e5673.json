She *checks notes* vomited on live national television. Yep. Not so cute. Not ideal.\n\nObviously, announcing your pregnancy, especially your FIRST pregnancy is a big deal. And I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t how Julia Ainsley expected to be announcing it, but it sure makes for a memorable story to tell her kids one day.\n\nJulia Ainsley, an NBC News correspondent was covering the Robert Mueller\u2019s first public statement about Trump\u2019s Russian ties in the early weeks of her pregnancy, you know, when morning sickness is a real bitch. The Mueller investigation is a huge story, so she couldn\u2019t skip out on work because she was feeling a little queasy.\n\nAs mentioned on @Morning_Joe today, here\u2019s the time Baby Girl Ainsley made herself known to the world by causing a little morning sickness on national television. Coming January 2020! pic.twitter.com/CfVIuifE2W \u2014 Julia E. Ainsley (@JuliaEAinsley) September 10, 2019\n\n\u201cI was familiar with the story, having covered every detail of the investigation and its conclusions from that very corner but something was different this day: I was seven weeks pregnant,\u201d she revealed. \u201cWith this being my first child, I didn\u2019t quite know my limits.\u201d\n\nWhen she thought she was out of sight after not speaking for 30-minutes on air, she chucked what she thought was a sneaky vom. Trump makes me feel like I\u2019m going to power-chuck too, don\u2019t worry Julia.\n\nBut no, this story wouldn\u2019t be newsworthy if she just did a quick bathroom run and came back looking fresh. Nope. This poor unfortunate soul had her vomit broadcast for the whole world to see.\n\nMorning sickness doesn\u2019t give a single fuck that you\u2019re reporting on one of the most important political stories of the year. Nope. Not even half a fuck. When you\u2019ve gotta chuck, you\u2019ve gotta chuck.\n\nObviously the \u201comg are you pregnant\u201d text poured in, forcing the first-time mum to announce her pregnancy after only seven weeks. But that\u2019s not even the worst part. Now her early morning sickness memories of her pregnancy are immortalised in NBC television archives for us all to see.\n\nThankfully there was no vomit vision, so we don\u2019t have to see her actually chucking. But what a fun way to announce your pregnancy to the world.\n\nAinsley shared the footage (shot in May) on Twitter this week. She also wrote a story for NBC, sharing the message that it\u2019s important to put your health before your work and prime.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already having to make decisions between what is best for my child and what advances my career, something I know I\u2019ll have to do for the years to come,\u201d she said. \u201cAlready this journey has taught me to put aside my pride, place my health first and lean on supportive colleagues.\u201d\n\nWhat a badass. Not only did she work through a hardcore vom sesh, but she absolutely owned it and didn\u2019t try to hide the footage like many people sure would.\n\nObviously, Twitter loved it and rallied around the new mum in support.\n\nWomen are badasses! Go to work even tho they're about to hurl any minute! Congratulations Julia, it'll get easier! ???? \u2014 Rice Krispy Tweets (@kristirice47) September 10, 2019\n\nShe is going to be a sensation must like her mother \u2014 Tom McKenna (@tmckshuz) September 10, 2019\n\nIf you\u2019re going to chuck your guts up on live TV, at least own it like Julia Ainsley did. Pregnancy is fucking hard. So is working while pregnant and trying to hide shit like morning sickness. Good on her for normalising the not-so-cute moments of pregnancy.", "description": "NBC Reporter Julia Ainsley was reporting on Robert Mueller's first address about Trumps connections with Russia when her morning sickness hit.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/julia_a_b5ae3b46882f7e63cd862226edd87483.fit-760w.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
