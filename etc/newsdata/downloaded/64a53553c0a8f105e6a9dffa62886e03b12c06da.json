First, Alex Jones is a loathsome conspiracy theorist who generates loathsome content. Second, there is no First Amendment violation when a private company chooses to boot anyone off a private platform. Third, it seems reasonably clear that Mr. Jones\u2019s content isn\u2019t just morally repugnant, it\u2019s also legally problematic. He makes wild, false claims that may well cross the line into libel and slander.\n\nRight now, Mr. Jones is defending lawsuits filed by multiple Sandy Hook Elementary families accusing him of making intentionally false factual statements. Most appallingly, he has insisted that these grieving families were faking their pain: \u201cI\u2019ve looked at it and undoubtedly there\u2019s a cover-up, there\u2019s actors, they\u2019re manipulating, they\u2019ve been caught lying and they were preplanning before it and rolled out with it.\u201d\n\nSo on Monday, when Apple, Facebook and YouTube acted \u2014 in seemingly coordinated fashion \u2014 to remove the vast bulk of Mr. Jones\u2019s content from their sites, there\u2019s no cause for worry, right? After all, this was an act of necessary public hygiene. A terrible human being who has no regard for truth or decency is finally getting what he deserves.\n\nWould that it were that simple.\n\nThere are reasons to be deeply concerned that the tech companies banned Alex Jones. In short, the problem isn\u2019t exactly what they did, it\u2019s why they did it.", "description": "\u201cHate speech\u201d is extraordinarily vague and subjective.
