Offering a minimal design with cool aesthetics and a reasonable price tag, Mi bands have definitely been popular for fitness enthusiasts in India, and now Mi has brought the much-awaited Mi Band 4 to the Indian market.\n\nWe got to test it out and this is what we liked and disliked about the Mi Band 4.\n\nWhat We Liked About The Mi Band 4\n\nThe Build\n\nThe Mi Band 4 follows the trend of making rugged and durable smart bands from its predecessors. The band on the first impression will seem reminiscent to the Mi Band 3, however, once you looked at the display, you'll notice the clear difference.\n\nMi has gone with a flat display for Mi Band 4 as opposed to a curvy touch-panel on top, which in my opinion is much better, considering now it won't be as prone to bumps and scratches, due to its flat and slim profile. The bottom still retains the heart-rate sensor to keep your heart-rate in check during extreme workouts.\n\nDon't Miss 1.8 K SHARES 1.4 K SHARES\n\nBackwards Compatible With Mi Band 3 Bands\n\nYou can also use your old Mi Band 3 straps with Mi Band 4 as they're compatible. So if you've invested a lot on a variety of bands, you won't be disappointed when you upgrade.\n\nBright Colourful OLED Display\n\nOne of the major reasons to upgrade to Mi Band 4 is the tiny colourful OLED screen that is a noteworthy upgrade from the black and white OLED screen on the previous Mi Bands. The display is really sharp, colourful and looks cool with a wide library of Mi watch faces to play with. It is also insanely bright, and even bright sunlight doesn't affect its visibility.\n\nYou Can Still Take It For A Swim!\n\nOne of the key inclusions in Mi Band 3 that made it a hit was that it was water-resistant enough to survive in a swimming pool. And with the Mi Band 4, all that stays the same. Cool, right?\n\nA Simpler UI\n\nMi Band 3 was a fun to use Band, but the long presses to get into menus was sometimes a hit and a miss. With Mi Band 4 however, that's gone and it's just a simple tap to select the option and to get in menus. Sliding from the edge takes you back and hitting the touch capacitive button gets you to the watch face.\n\nBattery Stamina\n\nXiaomi claims that Mi Band 4 can last a good 20 days on a single charge. And in my testing, I got almost that although I must mention that my screen wasn't on all the time and the heart rate sensor too wasn't on all the time. Moreover, it took roughly an hour to fully juice up. Overall impressive battery performance.\n\nWhat I Disliked\n\nCharging Cradle\n\nThe thing I hated the most on the Mi Band 4 was the charging cradle. When inserting the core module in it, it never stayed snap in it. And even the slightest movement popped it out, resulting in staying uncharged. I would have liked it to have a magnetic connector to snap on with ease.\n\nI loved the charging arrangement on the previous Mi Bands -- it felt firm and not as clumsy as this.\n\nLooks Dated\n\nSure, the Mi Band 4 follows similar design cues from Mi Band 2 and 3, it looks awfully similar too. Unless the screen isn't on, one won't be able to notice if it's the Mi Band 4 or the 3. I would have loved to see some design elements on the core or the band to make it truly stand out.\n\nVerdict\n\nXiaomi's Mi Band 4 brings some noteworthy and impressive improvements to the classic combination of features which makes the Mi Band 4 a true no-brainer to go for if you're in the market for a cool feature-loaded smart band on a budget. Priced at Rs 2,299 its worth every rupee. Just remember, it cannot fully replace a smartwatch just yet, but it gets awfully close.", "description": "Xiaomi's Mi Band has been one of the best fitness bands to go for in the Indian market.
