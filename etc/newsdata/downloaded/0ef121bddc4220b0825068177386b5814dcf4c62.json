Symptoms include diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting and fever.\n\nSick guests were told to stay in their rooms and keep away from public toilets, pools and restaurants, until 48 hours after the symptoms have passed.\n\nBut Ms Black said TUI\u2019s statement about a \u2018small\u2019 number was a \u2018significant understatement.\u2019\n\nShe said: \u2018The hotel doctor is fully booked until the day before we are due to fly home.\n\n\u2018Pool guests are in the toilets spilling their guts and then hopping back in the pool.\u2019\n\nMs Black claims the doctor charged her \u20ac200 (\u00a3170) for an \u2018injection and six different types of medications\u2019.\n\nHotel Riu Touareg is a popular destination for package holidays in Boa Vista, Cape Verde\n\nSick guests couldn\u2019t enjoy the facilities but spent most of their time on the toilet\n\nShe added: \u2018There are several others at the hotel who are experiencing the same symptoms.\u2019\n\nIn contrast, Seema Thomas said she had an \u2018amazing time\u2019 with her husband at the hotel earlier this month, but was concerned about the number of people falling ill.\n\nShe said there were \u2018queues outside the doctor\u2019s room\u2019 and her return flight to the UK was detained on the runway at Manchester Airport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe told Metro.co.uk: \u2018We had to wait for a medical team to check before they gave the ok to leave the plane.\n\n\u2018The passengers who declared themselves ill were asked to remain behind on the plane to be assessed further.\n\nShe added: \u2018A lot of people staying at the hotel had been experiencing illnesses a few days before I left the hotel.\n\nTUI warns guests about the outbreak\n\n\u2018There were queues outside the doctor\u2019s room in the hotel, parts of the pool were closed and staff were spraying hand sanitiser on everyone that entered the restaurants.\u2019\n\nRiu Touareg has a four-star average rating on TripAdvisor from nearly 11,000 guests, but reports of a \u2018dreaded gastro bug\u2019 feature in dozens of recent reviews.\n\nOne unfortunate reviewer wrote: \u2018I don\u2019t normally write reviews mid-stay, but here alone on this porcelain throne I find myself needing to eloquently express my shock that is the Riu Touareg.\n\n\u2018I had excursions lined up and eager to experience\u2026and yet quad biking with my gut in this state would lead to only what can be described as a faecal oil spill from ones now exhausted hole.\n\n\u2018The first 2 days were a delight, my bowels solid and impressive to any physician.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018And then my world and intestines came crashing down in a typhoon of sweetcorn and sewage.\n\n\u2018Usain Bolt had nothing on me after my dinner in the main restaurant, beer in hand obviously, and I\u2019m grateful for wedge high heels as these projected me to a solid 12mph to my room.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne positive reviewer said her recent stay was \u2018perfect\u2019 but advised other guests to come prepared for the \u2018bug\u2019.\n\nShe wrote: \u2018With regards to the \u201cbug\u201d, we were lucky I guess and didn\u2019t suffer but spoke to a few that had or still having an awful time.\u2019\n\nA TUI spokesperson said customer safety is their \u2018number one priority\u2019 and they are \u2018happy\u2019 to speak with concerned guests due to stay at Riu Touareg.\n\nIn a statement, the spokesperson said: \u2018We can confirm a small number of guests at the RIU Touraeg have reported being ill with symptoms consistent with gastroenteritis.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re working closely with the hotel and have put increased hygiene protocols in place, on top of the already stringent measures.\n\n\u2018We would be happy to speak to any customers due to stay at the hotel if they have any questions.\n\n\u2018The safety of our customers is always our number one priority and we would like to reassure\n\ncustomers that we closely audit all of the hotels we work with to ensure they meet our high health and safety standards.\n\n\u2018Situations like this are extremely rare.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
