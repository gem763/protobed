She was ordered to pay $30,000 and spend 14 days in prison.\n\nLoughlin has pleaded not guilty. This month, Andrew Lelling, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said that if Loughlin is convicted, \u201cI don't think I'm giving away any state secrets by saying we would probably ask for a higher sentence for her than we did for Felicity Huffman.\u201d\n\n\"The longer the case goes, let's say she goes through to trial. If it's after trial, I think certainly we'd be asking for something substantially higher. If she resolved her case short of trial, something a little lower than that. It's tough to tell at this point,\u201d he added.", "description": "Actress Lori Loughlin\u2019s daughters are no longer enrolled at the University of Southern California in the wake of allegations linking the actress to the college admissions scandal,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/lori_loughlin_olivia_jade_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
