The Chapmans are seeking punitive damages and plan to contest provisions of Tank\u2019s will.\n\n\u201cThey robbed her of her right to be his mother,\u201d said the Chapmans\u2019 lawyer Joe Murphy.\n\nTank and Dylan ran popular Tumblr accounts chronicling their relationship and sexual exploits, and Tank\u2019s death caused an uproar among their fans and online community. The five men had been living together in a polyamorous relationship in Seattle at the time of Tank\u2019s death, with Dylan acting as the \u201cmaster\u201d and the others serving as his submissives, his \u201cpups.\u201d Tank and the other pups had agreed to follow Dylan\u2019s orders as part of dating him.\n\nThe five men worked hard to make their bodies as large as possible, lifting weights for multiple hours a day and eating vast amounts. In pursuit of a sexual fetish for huge genitals, they would inject their penises and testicles with saline to temporarily enlarge them. They would later graduate to using silicone to permanently engorge their genitals. The latter procedure is both illegal and dangerous, and it proved lethal for Tank. He died of a pulmonary embolism induced by his injections in October 2018.\n\nDylan never notified Linda or Ben Chapman of Tank\u2019s illness, hospitalization, or death, according to the complaint, and he presented himself as having legal authority over Tank\u2019s remains, which were cremated. Tank spent a week in the hospital, part of it in a coma, but his mother would not learn of his fate until a week after his death, the complaint states.\n\n\u201c Dylan ordered Tank to use steroids to bulk up, degraded him, and forced him to publicly castigate himself for perceived violations of the relationship with Dylan, the complaint states. \u201d\n\nThe Australian allegedly began injecting silicone on Dylan\u2019s command in 2014 and continued until his death. The Chapmans alleged Dylan and the pups neglected their duty to care for Tank by requiring him to inject himself and possibly performing the injections themselves.\n\nChapman alleged that Dylan and the pups coerced Tank into inflating his scrotum to \u201cthe size of a basketball\u201d through a mix of manipulation and humiliation. Dylan ordered Tank to use steroids to bulk up, degraded him, and forced him to publicly castigate himself for perceived violations of the relationship with Dylan, the complaint states.\n\nAs a pup, Tank went to great lengths to demonstrate his devotion to Dylan. He changed his name from Jack Chapman to Tank Heathcliff Hafertepen, thereby adopting his pup name as his legal name to take Dylan\u2019s last name. He emigrated from Australia to the U.S. to join the pups and while in the States tattooed \u201cProperty of Master Dylan\u201d on his lower back under Dylan\u2019s astrological sign. His mother alleges Dylan forced him to cut off all contact to family in Australia.\n\nTank and Dylan often posted provocative pictures of themselves to the delight of thousands of fans, but when Dylan attempted to suppress news of Tank\u2019s death, posting online as if Tank were still alive and later misstating his cause of death, those same fans turned on him and blamed him for his partner\u2019s death.\n\nThe complaint references a contract Tank posted to his blog that describes ceding an extreme degree of control to Dylan, making use of lines like \u201cA pup\u2019s mind is the exclusive property of his master at all times\u201d and detailing how he would relinquish control of his finances, his time, and his friends. He also wrote that he would submit to body modifications, including saline scrotal inflation. Dylan previously told BuzzFeed News the agreement as posted online was a work of erotic fiction, but Tank did follow through with some of its stipulations like the \u201cproperty of\u201d tattoo.\n\n\u201c When a reader asked Tank how big he intended for his scrotum to become, he wrote, \u2018Master will decide when enough is enough.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBoth Tank and Dylan had acknowledged the dangers of silicone injections on their blogs, but when a reader asked Tank how big he intended for his scrotum to become, he wrote, \u201cMaster will decide when enough is enough.\u201d\n\nSeveral overlapping sexual subcultures played a role in their relationship: BDSM, puppy play, \u201cbears\u201d (hairy, husky gay men), and extreme body modification, but Tank\u2019s friends said the romance exceeded the normal boundaries of kinky romance and bled into toxic abuse.\n\nIn periods where the two had broken up, the complaint alleges, Tank himself had told friends that Dylan abused him both psychologically and physically, including subjecting him to \u201cphysical imprisonment.\u201d Dylan sued Tank at one point for thousands of dollars, claiming his former partner owed him backdated rent and had not paid for silicone Dylan purchased, the complaint alleges. The legal action was yet another display of dominance and ownership, according to the complaint. Despite the talk of abuse and legal threats, Tank and Dylan would eventually get back together.\n\nThe Chapmans are also planning to accuse Dylan and the pups of a more traditional type of coercion: the forced alteration of a will. Three weeks before his death, Tank drew up a will leaving everything to Dylan, most notably $200,000 from Tank\u2019s father. Linda Chapman previously said her son had always intended to leave the money to his autistic brother. In June, Dylan and the pups laid claim to the money in Australian court, according to Murphy, though they have not received it yet.\n\nCharles Osborn, one of the pups, is named as executor of Tank\u2019s will, which Chapman plans to challenge in court. A probate hearing on the matter has been set for next week, according to Murphy, and Osborn\u2019s status as a defendant in a wrongful death case may render him ineligible to execute the will.\n\n\u201cTank had wanted the money to go towards our home together, but without Tank it\u2019s a reminder of what I\u2019ve lost,\u201d Dylan previously said.\n\nMurphy said he and his client hope the suit holds Dylan and company accountable for Tank\u2019s death and ensures the man she calls her son\u2019s abuser doesn\u2019t benefit from his death.\n\n\u201cWe filed this suit to bring some closure and resolution. One of the most important parts to her will be discovery. She wants to know what happened,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWhy was she never called?\u201d\n\nDylan and the pups did not respond to a request for comment. When I previously sought comment from them in Seattle, they called the police, who arrested and jailed me.", "description": "Linda Chapman says Dylan Hafertepen forced her son to inject his penis and testicles with silicone.", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570510275/191007-Montgomery-wrongful-death-tease_gbao6w", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
