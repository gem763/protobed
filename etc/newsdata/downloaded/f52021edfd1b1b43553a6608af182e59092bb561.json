Kurdish civilians, including women and children, have been killed in the offensive, according to sobering images and video footage that circulated on social media over the weekend.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cDue to Turkey's irresponsible actions, the risk to U.S. forces in northeast Syria has reached an unacceptable level. We are also at risk of being engulfed in a broader conflict,\u201d Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in a statement.\n\n\u201cTherefore, at the President's direction, the Department of Defense is executing a deliberate withdrawal of U.S. military personnel from northeast Syria,\u201d he added.\n\nThe announcement came after a meeting of national security officials on Sunday and of other key administration officials at the White House earlier on Monday.\n\nEsper said the invasion of northern Syria \u201chas resulted in widespread casualties, refugees, destruction, insecurity, and a growing threat to U.S. military forces\u201d in addition to \u201cthe release of many dangerous ISIS detainees.\u201d\n\nHe further blamed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan for consequences of the offensive, \u201cto include a potential ISIS resurgence, possible war crimes, and a growing humanitarian crisis. The bilateral relationship between our two countries has also been damaged.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe statement added that Esper will be visiting NATO next week in Brussels, where he plans to press allied countries \u201cto take collective and individual diplomatic and economic measures in response to these egregious Turkish actions.\u201d\n\nEsper a day prior had confirmed that Trump ordered a larger withdrawal of U.S. forces \u2014 about 1,000 troops \u2014 from Syria than was previously indicated. Initially, about 50 troops were moved from two locations near the Syria-Turkey border.\n\nTrump made the decision to increase the withdrawal amid reports that Turkey will expand its offensive \u201cfurther south than originally planned and to the west,\u201d Esper said Sunday during an appearance on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeastern Syria and to turn over operations to Turkey has been met with sharp bipartisan criticism that accuses him of abandoning an ally and creating a situation for an ISIS resurgence.\n\nTrump has not backed down from his pledge to remove U.S. forces from the country and instead has said he will soon implement sanctions that will target government officials in Ankara and \u201cany persons contributing to Turkey\u2019s destabilizing actions in northeast Syria.\u201d\n\nIn a White House statement on Monday, Trump said he will redeploy troops coming out of Syria to elsewhere in the region \"to monitor the situation and prevent\" the return of ISIS.\n\nHe added, however, that \"a small footprint\" of U.S. forces will remain at the al-Tanf garrison in southern Syria \"to continue to disrupt remnants of ISIS.\"", "description": "The Pentagon on Monday announced the official withdrawal of U.S. forces from northeastern Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ussyriakurds_100619getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
