We focus mostly on their tweets, and indeed only the subset of tweets that is directly relevant to the fate of Brexit. And the more the public loses sight of what else goes on in the EU apart from Brexit, the fewer tools we have to engage with its politics in the future.\n\nTusk\u2019s speech in Athens, ahead of a decisive meeting of the European council this week, deserved much more critical scrutiny. Tusk cited Thucydides and Cicero and referred to an ancient ideal of freedom that philosophers in the past have contrasted with \u201cthe freedom of the moderns\u201d. The freedom of the ancients, it is often said, is characterised by shared commitment to the public good, equal laws and equal participation in public debate. The freedom of the moderns, on the other hand, is that of individuals pursuing their private interests, with the role of the state limited to guaranteeing their orderly interactions.\n\nTusk\u2019s appeal to a robust, civic ideal of the common good is especially welcome if one contrasts his vision with the imperial one endorsed on multiple occasions by Guy Verhofstadt, another prominent EU politician whose Brexit tweets make news. Better the republic than the empire, of course. But it was more than a little ironic that Tusk criticised the modern politics of subordination: pontificating about respecting democratic participation and refraining from domination in a place like Greece, in the aftermath of the 2015 referendum, is like mentioning the rope in the house of the hanged, as the German saying goes.\n\nNor does the EU look like it has learned any lessons on how to treat all its partners as equals in the future. Just look at the way it is handling the process of enlargement in the western Balkans, an item high on the agenda of the council meeting. Countries such as Albania and North Macedonia, which are expecting to open accession negotiations, are effectively held hostage by a process where deadlines come and go between faint praise and serious warnings that \u201cnot enough progress has been done\u201d to \u201cfight corruption\u201d and \u201cstrengthen the rule of law\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The timidity of the European response to Turkey\u2019s offensive in north-east Syria is a direct consequence of the EU\u2019s purely self-interested border deals.\u2019 Photograph: Erdem \u015eahin/EPA\n\nOr consider how power politics and commercial interests shape the other issue that is likely to be debated in the meeting of the council this week: Turkey. The timidity of the European response to the butchering of civilians in north-east Syria is, as Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s threat to \u201copen the gates and send 3.6 million refugees\u201d makes amply clear, a direct consequence of the EU\u2019s purely self-interested border deals. The lives of millions of innocent people are traded for a few hundred votes in response to the \u201cthreat of migration\u201d come the next round of elections. In this there is at least one aspect in common with the ancient world: the ancient Greeks were keen to distinguish between themselves and the inferior \u201cbarbarians\u201d.\n\nFor the rest, the EU cannot refashion itself as a champion of the common good, of the freedom of the ancients, for the simple reason that it exists to promote the freedom of the moderns, commercial interests and market competition, private vices as public benefits. It cannot be kept together by civic patriotism because its political ends are set by market purposes. When these collide and fail to work for everyone, we get a distinctively modern version of stasis, characterised not only by the shortage of pragmatic solutions to problems that have in the meantime become existential but, more dramatically, by a shortage of vision.\n\nBrexit is contributing to this shortage of vision. The idiosyncrasies of the process, the whims of the protagonists and the divisive passions of the public give the EU a veneer of calm, competence, and wisdom. The more recklessly Johnson and company act, the more responsible the EU looks. The more the UK government violates procedures, ignores institutional constraints, or tries to find ad hoc ways out of the process, the more the EU\u2019s capacity to stick to rules and deliver by the deadlines appear like the highest political virtues. In all this we forget to ask who the rules benefit, and to what purpose deadlines are applied.\n\nWe should not be fooled by the EU rhetoric of the common good. Its domestic order is marred by injustices and asymmetries of power, and the implications of its international stance on questions including border control and harm to civilians (as in the recent case of Kurdish people in Syria) are nothing short of criminal.\n\nBrexit will come to an end, one way or another \u2013 but the EU will continue to condition the debate and structure political relations for the foreseeable future. In trying to survive our extraordinary predicament, we should not neglect the ordinary delinquency of the EU, nor depoliticise its motives. We would be doing ourselves no favours in the long run.\n\n\u2022 Lea Ypi is professor of political theory at the London School of Economics", "description": "The chaos of Brexit has lent the European Union a veneer of calm and wisdom, says political theory professor Lea Ypi", "authors": ["Lea Ypi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64d96c35e13bf6fce653b2285e10899608935773/613_204_2787_1673/master/2787.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=87435c6edb5eea405a46f1964a0d5505", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
