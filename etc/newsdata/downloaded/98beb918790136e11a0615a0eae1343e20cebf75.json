Critics, however, don\u2019t think it is enough to save a company that is no stranger to drawing flack.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nSpeaking during a Friday call to discuss third-quarter earnings, Musk was positive about the direction of the company after reporting revenue of $6.3 billion in the third quarter. This number was boosted by free cash flow of $371 million. Of the third-quarter revenue, $5.3 billion is from Tesla\u2019s famed automobile component. The remainder comes from solar panels, energy storage and other components.\n\nThat\u2019s could be an area for growth for Tesla. On Friday, Musk said solar power and energy storage is an area where Tesla will expand and \u201ccould be bigger, but it will certainly be of a similar magnitude\u201d as to the revenue seen on the automotive side.\n\nGabe Hoffman, a hedge fund manager and founder of Accipiter Capital Management, has been critical of Tesla in the past. He doesn\u2019t see the company\u2019s foray into solar energy and storage as being a game-changer for Tesla.\n\n\u201cIf you believe this, I have a bridge to sell you,\u201d Hoffman told FOX Business. \u201cConsider [that] the solar panel Musk unveiled to sell the [Solar City] merger in 2016 didn\u2019t work and he lied to everyone, and he has lied to investors and the state of New York every step on the way with the solar business.\u201d\n\nIn the third quarter, Tesla reported that it \u201calso launched a commercial solar configurator for small and medium enterprises, with standardized and transparent pricing. Solar deployments have started to grow sequentially once again. In [third quarter], we deployed 43 [megawatts] of solar, 48% more than in the prior quarter.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Hoffman has voiced concern over the electric car produced by Tesla and what he terms as its \u201csubstantial quality issues.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s news does not augment his belief that the company has major flaws.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cNot in the slightest,\u201d Hoffman said.", "description": "Elon Musk said that the solar energy and storage components of Tesla will rival the automotive side.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/AP19168441376961.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
