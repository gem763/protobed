It\u2019s therefore very important that you patch your systems on a timely basis to stay protected from such attacks.\n\nRead next: Understand the foundations of web development with this $19 bundle", "description": "A new kind of trojan malware is fast gaining currency among cybercriminals for its capability to steal sensitive information, such as credit card data, cryptocurrency wallets, and email credentials.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fraccoon-malware.jpg&signature=87927a7ecb6bcc9781d3ace85c9067f4", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
