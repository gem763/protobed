Cheaper seats cost \u00a3105 while VIP packages are available for \u00a310,600 - which includes a chaffeur service and private entrances.\n\nThe 15,000-seater stadium is being built especially for the blockbuster heavyweight rematch", "description": "The Diriyah Arena is being built especially to host the high-profile rematch and work has now begun on its construction with little under two months to go until fight night.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/16/19793412-0-image-a-71_1571240582122.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
