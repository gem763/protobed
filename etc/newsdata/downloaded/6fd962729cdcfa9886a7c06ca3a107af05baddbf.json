Now he\u2019s on a bus in Iowa trying to win over voters and distinguish himself in a crowded field of Democrats running for president.\n\n\u201cI think of a lot of them think it\u2019s funny that someone they know is running for president,\u201d Buttigieg said of those he served with in Afghanistan. \u201cThey\u2019ve been encouraging.\"\n\nHe added: \"I mean a lot of them are more politically conservative than I am, but they are supportive.\u201d\n\nButtigieg decided to take a page from former Republican presidential candidate John McCain\u2019s playbook by emulating the Arizona senator's famous \u201cStraight Talk Express\u201d bus tours -- in which he traveled with members of the media and opened himself up to questions on any topic.\n\nIt was Buttigieg\u2019s first cup of coffee Sunday morning when he began comparing politics to football.\n\n\u201cI think football provides the most analogies for politics, he said. \"You\u2019re protecting the quarterback but it\u2019s not all about the quarterback -- because if you forget the importance of the line ,you\u2019re in trouble.\"\n\nThe campaign and reporters traveled to nine cities in four days on the Premiere Transportation coach that former President Barack Obama, legendary director Steven Spielberg, Sen. Mitt Romney, and entertainers Steve Harvey and Justin Timberlake have used. President Trump also rode on the bus at one point, according to Premiere Transportation staff.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t typical bus seating.\n\nThe furniture allowed Buttigieg to look reporters in the eye. The bus was equipped with Wi-Fi for the press to file stories, and a flat-screen television, which allowed Buttigieg to keep an eye on football and the news. Also installed: a counter full of snacks, including chocolate chip cookies, protein bars, chips, gummy bears and coffee.\n\n\u201cI like sliced pickles, but other than that, my snack choices are pretty basic. I like beef jerky,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen he wasn't talking to reporters, Buttigieg was trying to make contact with Iowa voters.\n\n\u201cI looked at all the presidential [candidates] and I put a chart out,\" Amani Latimer, a Wisconsin voter and founder of Mamas 4 Pete, said after Buttigieg\u2019s meet-and-greet in Dubuque. \u201cI was, like, all over analytics, and I said this guy gets it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he would make a great president, I mean he so\u2019s smart,\u201d Iowa caucusgoer Lindra Bicksler said after a campaign rally in Clinton. \u201cHe speaks seven languages and would be able to talk to leaders of other countries himself.\u201d\n\nWhile the yellow and blue bus rolled through rural Iowa, Buttigieg took a moment from talking with reporters to pull out his phone and look at the latest polls from The Des Moines Register and CNN. They put him fourth behind Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s a four-way race,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nButtigieg said the bus tour is just one part of his strategy of connecting with voters in smaller communities, who he says are key to the Dem nomination.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not too worried about a variation like that, especially in a moment when only one in five people say they\u2019ve made up their mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the important thing is that people know you, know what you\u2019re about, do they like what they see -- and we\u2019re seeing a lot of encouragement on that front.\u201d\n\nAs voters prepare for the first-in-the-nation caucus and the first primary in New Hampshire, Buttigieg said his campaign has plans to step up outreach to voters. The bus may next head for the Granite State.", "description": "Democratic Presidential Candidate Pete Buttigieg talks with reporters during his four-day bus tour throughout Eastern Iowa.", "authors": ["Mitti Hicks", "Mitti Hicks Joined Fox News In As A Multimedia Reporter Based In Des Moines"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/QrRAoFwSGKDOJvFvBH5bw-e1569604176131.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
