As the 2020 election approaches, it seems a cold war has been started by Democrats, with fake accusations and the latest \u201cwhistleblower\u201d report.\n\nThe chairman of the House Judiciary Committee made shameful parody accusations that are essentially a second fake-Steele-Dossier, opposition-researcher hoax. The same Democrats who advanced the Russia-collusion efforts and Mueller report are now continuing their impeachment drive with this whistleblower report, which was in fact written by Democratic congressional staffers and former Obama administration members. There is no real whistleblower as far as laws for whistleblower complaints go.\n\nPresident Trump, in turn, is right to ask Rep. Adam Schiff to resign after all the lies created during the Democrats\u2019 latest witch hunt. Mr. Schiff continues to use the same allegations he presented for two years to the supportive liberal media \u2014 allegations that were disproven and, like the media reports, shown to be bogus.\n\nLT.
