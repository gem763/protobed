Trump spent part of last month\u2019s G-7 summit defending his administration\u2019s decision to consider his Doral resort outside Miami when the U.S. hosts the annual gathering next year. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great place to be,\u201d he told reporters during a press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \u201cI think having it in Miami is fantastic, really fantastic.\u201d A casual observer could be forgiven for thinking he was trying to infuse some federal funds into Doral\u2019s depleted coffers.\n\nTrump\u2019s other U.S. properties have also become ersatz civic centers. Republican lawmakers and candidates spent more than $4 million nationwide to host rallies and fundraisers at the sites ahead of last year\u2019s midterm elections. And then there\u2019s the Trump International Hotel in D.C., which has become a gathering point for a certain slice of American politics who want to signal\u2014both in person and in cash\u2014their affinity for the president. Attorney General William Barr is even hosting his annual private holiday party at the hotel in December.\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem with this entire state of affairs. Ideally, Trump would enforce a strict separation between the Trump Organization and his administration to prevent the appearance, or reality, of corruption. Failing that, the federal government would have taken these properties to manage on the taxpayers\u2019 behalf so he and his family can\u2019t profit from the presidency. Instead, the president has charted a third course in which the Trump Organization and the federal government blend together in some sort of unholy corporate merger. It may be the most successful hostile takeover in history.\n\nThis is not surprising, given Trump\u2019s general disinterest in government ethics and his authoritarian impulses. He demands personal loyalty from FBI directors investigating his political allies and ousts attorneys general who don\u2019t misuse the Justice Department\u2019s immense powers on his behalf. Thanks to gaps in the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, he has replaced numerous Senate-confirmed officials in the executive branch with a pliable coterie of \u201cacting\u201d agency heads. In essence, he\u2019s governing more like a CEO whose orders are rarely questioned than the president of a liberal democracy.\n\nIndeed, even the more apolitical federal agencies are now behaving more like Trump Organization subsidiaries than civil servants working in the public interest. Last weekend, Trump mistakenly warned on Twitter that Alabama would be hit \u201charder than anticipated by Hurricane Dorian.\u201d The state actually faced a fairly remote risk of storm damage and the National Weather Service\u2019s Birmingham office quickly clarified on Twitter that Alabama was in no immediate danger. Trump spent the ensuing week lashing out at journalists about their coverage of the mistake. He even used a Sharpie to include the state inside the hurricane\u2019s path on a hastily annotated map.", "description": "It's the president's biggest business acquisition yet.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/7123cd05046f30e0a57d1e44d08c11c8ce6cc50d.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
