Latterly, it opened new restaurants, hotels and breweries. Chuck in a new Eurostar route, which connects London St Pancras with Rotterdam Centraal in just over three hours, and you\u2019ve got the ideal day trip.\n\nThere\u2019s a playfulness to Rotterdam and like Europe\u2019s other second cities, it\u2019s half the price. (And no, it\u2019s not anywhere, and it\u2019s definitely not Amsterdam.)\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAlthough this exciting harbour city has more than enough to entertain you for a weekend, it\u2019s also possible to see in just a day. Here\u2019s how to do it.\n\n08.15: Leave St Pancras\n\nThe first Rotterdam-bound Eurostar of the day pulls out from the buffers at 8.15am. After whizzing through the Kent and northern France lowlands, we zip through Brussels and into the Netherlands. We\u2019re travelling in Business Premier, so have stocked up with glossy magazines in the St Pancras lounge \u2013 which ranks as the best lounge I\u2019ve ever stepped foot in. The coffee! The croissants! The magazines!\n\n12.30: Pull into Rotterdam Centraal\n\nWhy are all European stations so much better than British ones? Rotterdam\u2019s central station, designed by a local firm and shaped like a scalene triangle pushed on its side, is as efficient and organised as the city itself. The bonus with travelling on Eurostar is that you are dropped right in the centre of town. No faffing about with airport trains or an expensive taxi here.\n\nThe station plaza funnels down to Mauritsweg, a wide boulevard dotted with concept stores (peek into Susan Bijl\u2019s colourful plastic bag shop, popular in Japan) and the modernist yellow and red Die Unie cafe.\n\n12.40: Ogle the Santa Clause sculpture\n\n\u201cOgle\u201d being the operative word here, as the sculptor behind Santa Clause, American Paul McCarthy, is known for incorporating phallic symbols into his pieces. It\u2019s the first thing that catches the eye on the festive statue in Eendrachtsplein: a slender \u201cpine tree\u201d in Santa\u2019s hand looks like anything but. Once you\u2019ve seen it, it\u2019s hard to look at anything else.\n\nWe laugh, but public art is taken extremely seriously in Rotterdam: phallic Santa is one of more than 1,000 public art pieces in the city.\n\n13.00: Explore Huis Sonneveld\n\nCross the busy tramway to Rochussenstraat and you\u2019ll find the city\u2019s first serious artistic hit: Huis Sonneveld, a living museum that was once the high-architecture home of local factory director Albertus Sonneveld. It manages to be both luxurious and functional at the same time: the turquoise-everything bathroom with double sinks is worth lingering over.\n\nOh, and there\u2019s a Picasso piece at the end of the street, of course.\n\n13.30: Wander Witte de Withstraat\n\nIf you want to have a good time, you come to Rotterdam\u2019s Witte de Withstraat \u2013 more specifically, make a beeline for speakeasy Caf\u00e9 De Witte Aap, instantly recognisable by its colourful monkey mural outside and a regular appearance in the world\u2019s best bar rankings. For something grander, head to the stately NRC cafe, housed in an old newspaper office.\n\nRather than getting boozed up (it\u2019s only 1.30pm after all), we duck into the Witte de With Centre for Contemporary Art, which houses two floors of contemporary art and sculpture. To avoid the \u20ac6 entry fee, visit on Friday from 7pm onwards.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to stay, but if we did, we\u2019d be booking into trendy King Kong Hostel with its snappy pavement seating, hammocks and what can only be described as twisty metal art inside.\n\n14.00: Get a watertaxi around the harbour\n\nRotterdam grew up around the water. Its port, the busiest in Europe no less, gave rise to the city\u2019s growth as an industrial hub, and also provided the canvas for a spectacular post-war building boom.\n\nAfter zipping out of the Leuvehaven port on a speedy yellow-and-black Spido watertaxi, it\u2019s hard to know where to look: on the Wilhelminapier there\u2019s Rem Koolhaas\u2019 blocky De Rotterdam office block, the slender Montevideo residential tower and the gorgeously art nouveau Hotel New York. The boat occasionally dips into the inner harbour, in which we find the posh Veer Harbour yacht club and the old-school Tropicana swimming club, now styled as a restaurant and a bar.\n\n14.30: Feel dizzy looking at the cube houses\n\nPrepare to feel more than a little dizzy staring up at the banana-yellow, 45-degree-angle cube houses of architect Piet Blom. These high-density units were designed in the 1970s to maximise space inside and below. Today some are available for rent on Airbnb \u2013 we make do with a quirky Instagram shot from underneath.\n\n15.00: Snack at the Markthal\n\nRotterdam has no shortage of impressive architecture, but the slate-grey and glass horseshoe-shaped Markthal perhaps takes the top spot. Inside the 11,000m-sq indoor market is a dreamy, childlike Pixar-style illustration called Hoorn des Overvloeds (Horn of Plenty). Underneath the giant cartoonish fruit, insects and seeds are food and drink stalls plying local snacks. This is the place to snaffle gin and tonic at Obba\u2019s Foodbar, sausage at Monsieur Saucisson and a lot of local Rotterdam cheese\u2026\n\n15.30: Pour yourself a beer at Thoms Brewery\n\nRotterdam has been quietly establishing itself a reputation as a craft beer hub. The Thoms Stadsbrouwerij brewery has a 42m wooden bar (Rotterdam\u2019s longest, so no need to feel guilty about propping yourself up on it) and individual tables with pour-it-yourself taps. Bar snacks include the Dutch must-eat beef ragu bitterballen (best described as round croquettes) and squeaky cubes of Rotterdam cheese.\n\n16.30: Early dinner at FG Food Labs\n\nOK, so it\u2019s a very early dinner. But we\u2019ve only got the day, and Rotterdam\u2019s foodie scene is criminally underrated. Buried underneath a railway arch not far from Rotterdam Centraal, this one Michelin-starred restaurant (confusingly, there\u2019s a more formal two Michelin-starred place next door) serves delicious French-South American fusion plates. The half-Dutch, half-Aruban chef, who worked with Heston Blumenthal, favours the same bonkers combinations: chocolate with caviar, pigeon with cherry and almonds. The only problem is you\u2019ll have to inhale it to get back to the station in time.\n\n17.58: Train back to Brussels\n\nWhile the outbound train to Rotterdam is direct, the return leg involves a Thales train and a switch in Brussels to the Eurostar, although plans are afoot to make the link direct.\n\n21.33: Return to London St Pancras\n\nThe only problem with just a day trip is that I feel we\u2019ve only scratched the surface of this fascinating second city. I\u2019m already planning a return \u2013 but over a weekend this time.\n\nTravel essentials\n\nOne-way fares to Rotterdam from \u00a335 with Eurostar (eurostar.com). Trains run from London to Amsterdam (via Rotterdam) twice daily.\n\nFor more information about visiting Rotterdam, visit en.rotterdam.info.", "description": "According to my Independent colleague Helen Coffey\u00a0\u2013 and most of the travel media, let\u2019s be honest \u2013 Rotterdam is having a moment, a theory given extra clout by its recent selection as host city for\u00a0Eurovision 2020.", "authors": ["Cathy Adams", "Claire Lomas"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/28/16/gvrwilhelminapierrotterdam-gerhard-van-roonkunst-en-vliegwerk-rp.jpg"}
