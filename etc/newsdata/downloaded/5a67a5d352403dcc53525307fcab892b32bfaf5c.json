Those examples, both of which ended with the commander in chief beating the charges against him and serving out his full term, on first blush do appear to bolster that case.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAndrew Johnson\u2019s experience in particular astounds to this day. After that president\u2019s egregious behavior and manifest unfitness for office got him impeached by the Republican-dominated House in 1868, the Senate failed to remove him from office \u2014 by one vote. That result came despite the GOP holding a greater-than-two-thirds majority in the Senate.\n\nThe wrong lesson, however, can be taken from Johnson\u2019s nonconviction. Senators allowed the president to remain in place partly because they suspected the law that the president had violated to prompt his impeachment, the Tenure of Office Act, itself stood on particularly shaky ground. (It was, in fact, later ruled unconstitutional.) Other articles of impeachment against Johnson included \u201ccrimes\u201d like speaking ill of Congress in public \u2014 which may very well have contravened a lingering norm from the early days of the republic but fell very well short of warranting immediate ejection from the presidency.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine Trump\u2019s forthcoming impeachment resting on such weak foundations. Most likely, articles of impeachment against him will point to core abuses of power, obstruction of justice and failure to comply with lawful congressional subpoenas \u2014 and that\u2019s if the House only chooses to highlight misdeeds related to the Ukraine debacle.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat about the most recent failed conviction of an impeached chief executive? After Bill Clinton\u2019s articles of impeachment for perjury and obstruction of justice passed the House in 1999, GOP senators couldn\u2019t muster even a majority vote to convict him on either article, much less the two-thirds needed to kick him out of the White House.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth recalling that Clinton\u2019s acquittal came largely because his violations of law were intended to cover up a personal affair, not a matter of state, and were not seen as a persistent pattern of inherent unfitness. The situation now is quite different. Trump\u2019s actions on the Ukraine scandal alone implicate the constitutional fabric itself, and they build on inappropriate activities described in detail in the scathing Mueller report. This all puts senators tasked with judging Trump in a different place than those who judged Clinton.\n\nThe Senate-will-never-convict club can discount this history, pointing instead to congressional Republicans\u2019 sycophancy during the past two years, and credibly say, \u201cGOP senators are in lock-step with the president and will rally around their fellow Republican.\u201d And indeed, getting 20 out of 53 Republican senators to agree to boot him from office won\u2019t be easy under any circumstances.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump, however, is far from an institutional Republican. He had never run for office as a Republican before the 2016 presidential election. From the 1980s into the Obama years, he donated more to Democratic candidates than to Republican ones. As late as 2004, he said he identified more as a Democrat than as a Republican.\n\nHis party credentials contrast sharply with the most recent nearly impeached Republican president, Richard M. Nixon. By the time the Judiciary Committee voted on articles of impeachment against Nixon, he had been a steady partisan for almost 30 years: a Republican representative and senator from California from 1947 until 1953, vice president of the United States for eight years under Dwight D. Eisenhower, the party\u2019s standard-bearer in the 1960 presidential election, Republican candidate in the 1962 California gubernatorial race and president since 1969.\n\nSo when Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) in early August 1974 led a GOP triumvirate to the White House to tell Nixon that he\u2019d lost the congressional support necessary to hold on to the presidency \u2014 telling him, \u201cThere\u2019s not more than 15 senators for you\u201d \u2014 he was addressing the man who many Republicans saw as the face of the party.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNot so now. While the GOP has largely embraced Trump\u2019s political program even where it breaks with long-standing party orthodoxy, he has earned little enduring loyalty within the establishment. Republican senators remain loathe to break openly with the president, but former senator Jeff Flake last month candidly assessed that 35 of his former GOP colleagues would vote to remove Trump from office if the poll were taken in private. \u201cAnybody who has sat through two years, as I have, of Republican luncheons,\u201d Flake also said, \u201crealizes that there\u2019s not a lot of love for the president.\u201d\n\nFlake\u2019s point has limited utility; a Senate trial of Trump would not end, of course, with a private vote. His observation nevertheless reveals a core truth: Republican support for Trump is highly instrumental, not fundamental. If the president\u2019s overall approval rating sat above 60 percent (as Bill Clinton\u2019s did during his impeachment trial), or if the majority of the American people opposed impeachment and removal as they did then, or even only if support among Republicans for Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal remained in the single digits, fear of Trump\u2019s tweets would probably keep GOP senators in line.\n\nPolls now tell a different story. Trump\u2019s aggregated approval rating has never escaped the 35 to 45 percent band, keeping it stunningly short of Clinton\u2019s overall numbers. Plus, a new Fox News poll shows 51 percent of respondents support impeaching and removing Trump. And a Washington Post-Schar School poll reveals that 18 percent of Republicans support his impeachment and removal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn this environment, even the small dose of political courage we\u2019ve seen this week from Republicans on Capitol Hill matters. On the Ukraine affair, at least two GOP senators \u2014 Mitt Romney (Utah) and Ben Sasse (Neb.) \u2014 publicly expressed concern about the president\u2019s actions. Before Trump\u2019s angry tweets responding to Romney could become a headline story, the president\u2019s decision to expose Kurds in northern Syria to Turkish attacks spurred much wider criticism from Republican senators, including firm Trump ally Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.). Talk is cheap, yes. But coming on the heels of so many instances of GOP senators\u2019 silence in the wake of Trump\u2019s controversies, one can forgive The Post\u2019s Shane Harris for calling it a \u201cRepublican rebellion.\u201d Most importantly, the president uncharacteristically refrained from lashing out at those who disagreed with him.\n\nPolitical momentum has odd properties. When tides turn, they often turn quickly and harshly. While the basic math still points to a Senate acquittal, this week nevertheless brings to mind Winston Churchill\u2019s words after the British victory at El Alamein in 1942: \u201cNow this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The history of past acquittals isn\u2019t as helpful to Trump as naysayers believe.", "authors": ["David Priess", "David Priess Is Chief Operating Officer At The Lawfare Institute", "A Visiting Fellow At The National Security Institute Of George Mason University", "A Former Cia Intelligence Officer.
