But the group has in the past proved resilient, continuing to mount or inspire attacks in the region and beyond despite losing most of its territory in recent years.\n\nBaghdadi had long been sought by the United States - which offered a $25 million reward for his capture - as leader of a jihadist group that at one point controlled large areas of Syria and Iraq, where it declared a caliphate.\n\nIslamic State has carried out atrocities against religious minorities and attacks on five continents in the name of an ultra-fanatic version of Islam that horrified mainstream Muslims.\n\n\u201cBaghdadi\u2019s death represents a huge blow to the organization\u2019s capacity to swell its ranks, mobilize its existing supporters and develop the momentum that could restore it to its past glories,\u201d said Ranj Alaaldin, a fellow at Brookings Institution in Doha focused on Iraq.\n\n\u201cThat said, ISIS (Islamic State) will still be a potent, under-ground terrorist threat.\u201d\n\nTrump said \u201cmany\u201d of Baghdadi\u2019s people were killed in the raid and added that in blowing himself up, Baghdadi also killed three of his children.\n\nU.S. forces suffered no personnel losses, he said. He also thanked Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq for their support.\n\nTurkey said it was proud to have helped \u201cbring a notorious terrorist to justice\u201d, but Russia\u2019s response was skeptical, with the defense ministry in Moscow saying that it had no reliable information on the U.S. raid and observing there had been previous attempts to kill Baghdadi.\n\nTrump said Baghdadi \u201creached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and his three children\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe died ... whimpering and crying and screaming.\u201d\n\nU.S. PULLBACK\n\nThe raid comes weeks after Trump announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northeastern Syria, which permitted Turkey to attack America\u2019s Kurdish allies as it sought to set up a \u201csafe zone\u201d.\n\nThe move drew withering criticism from fellow Republicans and Democrats, who expressed concern both at the abandoning of the Kurdish fighters who were instrumental in defeating Islamic State forces in Syria, and that the move might allow the group to regain strength and pose a threat to U.S. interests.\n\nTrump said the raid would not change his decision to withdraw troops from Syria.\n\nBut the successful targeting of Baghdadi could help blunt those concerns, as well as boosting Trump domestically at a time when he is facing an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nRegional allies welcomed the operation, with Turkey\u2019s President Tayyip Erdogan saying it marked \u201ca turning point in our joint fight against terrorism\u201d and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praising an \u201cimpressive achievement\u201d.\n\nBut some, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, also warned Islamic State was not finished. \u201cAl-Baghdadi\u2019s death is a hard blow against Islamic State, but it is just a stage,\u201d he said. France\u2019s interior minister called for increased vigilance in case of acts of revenge by extremists.\n\nLongtime U.S. foe Iran, which accuses the United States and its allies of creating Islamic State, was dismissive. Information Minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi, tweeted: \u201cNot a big deal, You just killed your creature\u201d.\n\nIraqi analyst Hisham al-Hashemi, an expert on jihadist groups, said Baghdadi\u2019s death was likely to lead to a split within Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThe split in IS is inevitable, it always happens when any radical religious group loses a charismatic leader,\u201d he said.\n\nNIGHT-TIME RAID\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump makes a statement at the White House following reports that U.S. forces attacked Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in northern Syria, in Washington, U.S., October 27, 2019. REUTERS/Jim Bourg\n\nIn the hours before Trump\u2019s announcement, sources in the region had described the raid on a compound in the village of Barisha, in Idlib province bordering Turkey, in the early hours of Sunday.\n\nIraqi state television broadcast night-time footage of an explosion and daytime images of a crater in the ground and what it said was the aftermath of the raid, including torn and blood-stained clothes.\n\nIraq\u2019s military said later in a statement that its intelligence services had located Baghdadi\u2019s whereabouts and had passed the information to the United States.\n\nTrump said eight helicopters carried the U.S. special forces troops to the compound where Baghdadi was hiding, where they were met with gunfire before blasting their way in through the walls to avoid a booby-trapped main door.\n\nThe U.S. forces spent around two hours in the compound, he said, adding that they had taken away \u201chighly sensitive material and information\u201d.\n\nRussia \u201ctreated us great\u201d by opening up airspace it controlled for the raid and Kurdish allies gave some helpful information, according to Trump. The Russian defense ministry, however, said it was not aware of any assistance to U.S. forces.\n\nThe president said he watched the operation unfold in the Situation Room of the White House.\n\nThe military named the operation against Baghdadi after U.S. aid worker and hostage Kayla Mueller, U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien told NBC's \"Meet the Press\". In 2015, U.S. officials told Reuters here Mueller had been repeatedly raped by Baghdadi himself before she died in Islamic State custody earlier that year.\n\nRELIEF FOR A GRIEVING FATHER\n\nAt the height of its power, Islamic State ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates valleys to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital Baghdad.\n\nThousands of civilians were killed by the group as it mounted what the United Nations called a genocidal campaign against Iraq\u2019s Yazidi minority. It also caused worldwide revulsion by beheading foreign nationals from countries including the United States, Britain and Japan.\n\nIn one notorious incident, referred to by Trump in his TV address, a captured Jordanian air force pilot was burned alive in a cage.\n\nOn Sunday the pilot\u2019s father, Safi Al-Kasaesbeh, told Reuters TV he was relieved by news of Baghdadi\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI am proud and happy on this day, after hearing of the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, this corrupt man, this insect, this virus that spread throughout the body of not only the Arab nation but also the Muslim nation, who distorted the image of Muslims and Islam,\u201d he said.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nThe group has claimed responsibility for or inspired attacks in dozens of cities including Paris, Nice, Orlando, Manchester, London and Berlin, and in nearby Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\nBut in 2017 Islamic State lost control of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, and quickly thereafter almost all of its territory, turning Baghdadi into a fugitive.", "description": "Fugitive Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died \"whimpering and crying\" in a raid by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria, President Donald Trump announced on Sunday, fulfilling what he called his top national security goal.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445523395&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0I5", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
