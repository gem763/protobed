This roster is so deep and talented. It will be interesting to see.\u201d\n\nThe final decision likely will make an important mark on the playoff identity of the Nationals, who were in a virtual tie with the Milwaukee Brewers (86-70) for the top wild-card spot Monday as they began a five-game home series against the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nVoth tried to aid the cause when he started on Sunday at the Miami Marlins. He allowed just one run on three hits in five innings, but the bullpen let the game get away and Voth took a no-decision in the 5-3 loss.\n\nVoth, 27, had a cut on his middle finger that limited his off-speed selection.\n\n\u201cIt was bugging me for most of the game,\u201d he said.\n\nVoth (1-1, 3.35 ERA) has made eight appearances this year for Washington, with seven starts. A fifth-round pick in 2013, Voth has also spent time this year with Triple-A Fresno and Double-A Harrisburg and made one rehab outing in the Gulf Coast League.\n\nLike Voth, Fedde also has had a circuitous season. He pitched at three levels, including Double-A and Triple-A, and has been used as both a starter and reliever.\n\nA first-round selection in 2014, Fedde is 4-2 for Washington with a 4.68 ERA in 19 games, with 12 starts.\n\nNationals pitching coach Paul Menhart said both men have bright futures.\n\n\u201cThey have big league pitches that only lack consistency,\u201d Menhart said. \u201cBut overall, we\u2019ve been very pleased with their efforts. Being able to start and pitch out of the bullpen has really increased their value. Experiencing both roles is only going to help them obtain a major league spot moving forward.\u201d\n\nFedde made three starts in July for the Nationals, a month in which Scherzer was limited to two. Fedde won all three of his starts in August. In his last start on Aug. 18 against the Brewers, he allowed four runs on 10 hits in five innings but still got the win.\n\n\u201cI feel like I have learned a lot this year for the future,\u201d Fedde said. \u201cIt has been a whirlwind of a year, starting and relieving. I have been pretty happy with the way I have thrown. I feel I have helped the team.\u201d\n\nWith the postseason on the horizon, there won\u2019t be a need for a No. 5 starter very soon. Fedde and Voth instead could be used as bullpen arms during the playoffs. Fedde has recent experience as a reliever and manager Dave Martinez has mentioned Voth as an option for the same role.\n\n\u201cI often think about, once we get there, [Voth could] be a guy that we can plop in and he can get big outs for us,\u201d Martinez said this month. \u201cHe\u2019s got good stuff, and we just got to keep him going.\u201d\n\nBut until then, they will play whatever role the team needs them. For instance, Fedde has been a spot starter throughout the season. He had to be ready to pitch while Scherzer was injured earlier in the year in case the ace couldn\u2019t go.\n\nFedde realizes the obvious \u2014 Scherzer (10-7, 2.81 ERA) at less than 100% is better than most alternatives.\n\n\u201cI had to kind of shadow him in a way and stay out of his way, but be able to go,\u201d Fedde said. \u201cWe want the Cy Young Award winner on the mound when we can.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
