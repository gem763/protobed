Tinder is seeking at least $2 billion.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe lawsuit claims that there were written contracts between IAC and Match and Tinder employees, including founders Sean Rad, Justin Mateen and Jonathan Badeen. The contracts required Tinder be valued on specific dates in 2017, 2018, 2020 and 2021 and that the workers should be allowed to exercise their stock options and sell them to IAC and Match.\n\nThe court papers further allege New York-based IAC and Match instead created false financial information, delayed new products and used other tactics to try to keep Tinder's valuation low. Tinder was then merged into Match Group, which the lawsuit says was a pretext to extinguish Tinder employees' stock options.\n\nTINDER CO-FOUNDERS SUE PARENT COMPANY FOR $2 BILLION\n\nTinder is worth more than $20 billion today, spokesperson for the dating app's attorney said.\n\nThe appeals court\u2019s ruling on Tuesday was in line with New York State Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla\u2019s June 13 decision, which argued they could pursue certain legal claims, such as prospective economic advantage, breach of contract and intentional interference, Reuters reported.\n\nIn a statement provided to FOX Business, an IAC spokesperson said: \u201cThis baseless lawsuit has no more merit today than it did over a year ago when it was filed. We look forward to defending ourselves in court.\u201d\n\nMATCH GROUP SUBPOENAED BY DOJ\n\nBoth IAC and Match sued Rad in January 2019 for allegedly secretly copying the companies\u2019 information, and later submitted a $400 million countersuit, this time for allegedly secretly recording conversations he had with his superiors, according to the news outlet.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nTinder\u2019s attorney, Orin Snyder told FOX Business IAC and Match \"cheated our clients and engaged in a brazen cover-up.\"\n\n\"We are pleased that the appellate court unanimously upheld the trial court\u2019s decision and rejected IAC\u2019s latest maneuver to avoid a trial,\" Snyder said in the prepared statement. \"The evidence of IAC\u2019s lawless behavior is mounting. We look forward to presenting it to the jury.\u201d\n\nThe jury trial is set for 2020.\n\nThe Associated Press and FOX Business reporter Thomas Barrabi contributed to this report.\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "Tinder was handed a small victory in its court case against parent company IAC/InterActiveCorp and subsidiary Match Group on Tuesday, when an appeals court rejected the latter groups\u2019 attempt to dismiss the $2 billion lawsuit filed against them.", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
