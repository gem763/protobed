The deal announced Thursday makes DraftKings the NFL\u2019s \u201cofficial daily fantasy partner.\u201d\n\nThe league has joined with Caesars Palace for sports betting marketing, its first deal with a traditional casino company. But the NFL remains the only major North American sports league not to designate a full-fledged sports betting partner.\n\nThe NFL hasn\u2019t closed off the possibility of such a deal and the partnership with DraftKings potentially gives the Boston-based firm an advantage.\n\n\u201cThe focus is to make sure that we\u2019re protecting the consumer and the integrity of the game,\u201d said Renie Anderson, chief revenue officer and executive vice president of NFL partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take our time, when we feel it\u2019s ready and right to go into that space, that we\u2019ve dotted all the I\u2019s and crossed all the T\u2019s.\u201d\n\nIn daily fantasy, fans wager on the performance of individual players, rather than the outcome of the game. While regarded by many as a form of gambling, it is regulated differently than betting on the outcome of games, which is now legal in a dozen states.\n\n\u201cThis is a defining moment in the industry, and we are thrilled to become the first daily fantasy sports partner to enter into a formal relationship with the NFL,\u201d DraftKings CEP Jason Robins said in a statement. \u201cThroughout our discussions with the league, it was evident we share a common vision around the future of fan engagement.\u201d\n\nThe deal allows DraftKings to use NFL logos, official statistics, highlights and other content on its platforms.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The NFL has joined with DraftKings as its provider for daily fantasy sports, moving the league closer to a full embrace of legal sports betting.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ben Nuckols"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
