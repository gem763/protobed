Jonah Lomu powered his way over England\u2019s line on four occasions, almost single\u2011handedly leading the All Blacks into their second World Cup final as England conceded 45 points.\n\nIt was a display that prompted the England captain, Will Carling, to jokingly call the New Zealander \u201ca freak\u201d while the England full\u2011back Mike Catt, who endured a particularly torrid match in Cape Town, recalled ruefully this month: \u201cWe\u2019d beaten Australia the week before, won with a drop goal by Rob Andrew. Then along came the big man and he ran over me. The three times after that he just ran around me.\u201d\n\nHansen and Jones try subtle resets for Rugby World Cup pressure game | Robert Kitson Read more\n\nEngland\u2019s preparation for that semi-final was vastly different than now. In the final World Cup of the amateur era England paid very little attention to the imposing Lomu, as Kyran Bracken, who was among the replacements that day explains.\n\n\u201cIn the amateur era, preparing to face Jonah Lomu was not on our radar. With the absence of a defence coach, all our focus went into how we were going to score tries. It was mainly all about ourselves \u2013 the attitude was: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Tony [Underwood] will deal with him.\u201d\n\nAt 5ft 9in and 13st 5lb, Underwood must have been licking his lips at the prospect of coming toe to toe with the colossal Lomu, 6ft 5in and 18st 7lb.\n\nReflecting on the game, Bracken added how the England players jokingly labelled Catt \u201cthe sleeping policeman \u2013 but he didn\u2019t really get what that meant\u201d, with the full-back helpless alongside Underwood in his attempts to thwart Lomu.\n\nIn 1999 the teams were again drawn in the same pool and it was all about Lomu. \u201cThe biggest thing for us was closing Lomu down and not allowing him the space,\u201d says the left-wing Dan Luger. \u201cEveryone was telling me how lucky I was to not be playing against him.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nHaving brushed Italy aside in their opening game, England were brimming with confidence. Despite dominating the early stages, England\u2019s first points came after 28 minutes with a Jonny Wilkinson penalty.\n\nAs the prop Phil Vickery recalls: \u201cI remember the fast start, but just as it was back then, a lapse of concentration for five minutes and you\u2019re two tries down. New Zealand play the game at a higher level for longer than anyone else.\u201d\n\nLuger says the 1999 World Cup came too early in Clive Woodward\u2019s reign for England to be successful. \u201cClive was all about attention to detail. We didn\u2019t have the physical preparation yet and that was the process that was to come in the next four years.\n\n\u201cThe training wasn\u2019t cutting edge enough. We spent time with the marines which was great from a mental preparation perspective but very poor from a physical preparation point of view \u2013 running with logs for 5km and not sleeping in the buildup to one of the biggest games of our lives.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 0:52 England train in heavy rain ahead of Rugby World Cup semi-final \u2013 video\n\nEngland were noticeably fatigued in the second half against New Zealand, tied at 16apiece with 25 minutes to play, and they failed to take advantage of the chances that came their way. Lomu proved the difference once more and England were consigned to another defeat.\n\nVickery says: \u201cThey have been the benchmark of rugby for as long as I can remember. They laid the foundations for how the game should be played and are the ultimate test.\u201d\n\nThat was the problem England wrestled with in the buildup to their first World Cup game against New Zealand in 1991. Peter Winterbottom, the England openside flanker that day, concurs that New Zealand have always set the standard.\n\n\u201cWhen Geoff Cooke started in 1988 as the England coach, his whole vision was looking towards the 1991 World Cup,\u201d he says. \u201cIn one of the first meetings with Geoff, he asked us who are the best side in the world and we all said New Zealand. He asked how are you going to beat them. We all scratched our heads.\u201d\n\nHeavy duty: England and All Blacks\u2019 weight increase since 1991 a sign of the times | Robert Kitson Read more\n\nThey identified the set piece as an area in which they could trouble their opponents. But they failed to dominate and England, tryless on the day, were narrowly beaten 18\u201112 at Twickenham. \u201cThe set piece was where we felt we could get the edge on them. We would have liked to execute our plan better than we did. We made a few mistakes and that gave the All Blacks opportunities.\u201d\n\nEngland did, however, advance further in the tournament than their opponents in that World Cup, as they eventually lost the final against Australia. Winterbottom admits the opening-day defeat was a crucial lesson. \u201cThe senior players sat down after the game and we said we need to be far more hard-nosed. We can\u2019t give sides as much as we gave New Zealand if we are going to be successful.\u201d\n\nAlthough England\u2019s record against New Zealand at World Cup tournaments makes bleak reading \u2013 played three, lost three \u2013 the players from those matches believe this time it could be different.\n\nWhile Bracken and Winterbottom believe that the game is \u201c50-50\u201d and the winners of Saturday\u2019s semi-final will be the World Cup winners, Vickery and Luger are even more optimistic about England\u2019s chances. \u201cI truly believe this England team can go on and win the whole thing,\u201d Vickery says. At least they will not have Lomu to contend with.", "description": "The All Blacks, and Jonah Lomu in particular, have proved to be unbeatable foes in all their previous Rugby World Cup meetings", "authors": ["Ben Hart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b592cb169b3cbdb884b7760e40c88b9acf2af07/0_183_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d9c06e6f34c158942a9dc0e50b119970", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
