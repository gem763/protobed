A task that will last six days, the deal said.\n\nAt that moment Russian and Turkish forces will begin joint patrols 10km into the buffer-zone area.\n\nThe agreement, if successfully implemented, will likely herald the end of Turkey's incursion in northern Syria. It may also consolidate the Syrian government's hold over northeastern Syria which until two weeks ago had been controlled by Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin opened the Tuesday press conference saying that Moscow \u201cappreciates\u201d Turkey\u2019s national security concerns but insists \u201cSyria must be free from foreign military presence.\u201d\n\nMr Erdogan outlined the understanding saying: \u201dThe main aim of the operation is to take out PKK/YPG terror organisations from the area and to facilitate the return of Syrian refugees.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnkara regards the YPG as terrorists because of their affiliation with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is waging an insurgency in southeast Turkey.\n\n\u201cThis operation also guarantees Syria territorial integrity and political unity. We never had any interest in Syria land and sovereignty,\u201d he added.\n\nThe two presidents met as a five-day cease-fire between Turkish troops and Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria was set to expire.\n\nUnder the earlier US-brokered deal, Kurdish forces were supposed to withdraw from Mr Erdogan\u2019s desired 30km deep buffer zone.\n\n\n\nBut Kurdish commanders accused Ankara of violating the agreement and continuing to fire on their fighters preventing them from pulling back.\n\nTurkey meanwhile accused the Kurds of breaking the truce by leaving 1,300 Syrian Kurdish fighters in the ceasefire area.\n\nTurkey launched its controversial cross border incursion in northeastern Syria earlier this month to repel Kurdish forces who once fought alongside US soldiers against the Islamic State.\n\nPresident Erdogan said it aimed to build a \u201csafe zone\u201d where he also hopes to repatriate some of the 3.5 million Syrian refugees currently living in Turkey.\n\nBut he has faced mounting condemnation for the operation which has displaced hundreds of thousands of people and killed at least 70 civilians according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\nAmnesty International has also accused Turkey and its Syrian rebel allies of likely committing war crimes, including indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas and an execution-style killing of a Kurdish female politician.\n\nTurkey has vehemently denied the allegations and dismissed claims made by Kurdish doctors that it has used chemical weapons or white phosphorus as \u201cflagrant slanders\u201d.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, once a close ally of the Kurds, was accused of green-lighting the operation after announcing US troops would pull back from northern Syria and not intervene in the imminent Turkish attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe later ordered most of the 1,000 US troops stationed in the country to completely withdraw. Many of them were pelted with vegetables by angry Kurdish residents as they crossed Syria's border into Iraq on Monday.\n\nFacing the Turkish incursion alone, the Kurds then struck a deal with President Bashar al-Assad to defend the borders.\n\nIt was a massive territorial win for the Assad regime who has deployed government troops to Kurdish-controlled areas for the first time in five years.\n\nUnder Tuesday\u2019s deal, government border guards would assist Russian forces in the YPG withdrawal. There has yet to be any official response from the Kurdish side.", "description": "*/Russia and Turkey have struck a deal to jointly police northeastern Syria that they say will end two weeks of bloodshed, just hours before a ceasefire in the area was due to expire.
