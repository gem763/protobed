The National Hurricane Center (NHC) has issued a hurricane warning for the northwestern Bahamas, where tropical-storm-force winds are expected over the weekend.\n\nThe storm reached the island on Sunday at about 2 PM EDT, bringing hurricane-force winds and a \"life-threatening storm surge\" of 18 to 23 feet, with \"large and destructive waves,\" according to the NHC and early reports. As Dorian traversed the island, the NHC warned residents not to exit shelter into the eye of the storm.\n\nDorian is now projected to move towards Florida, nearing the state's east coast late Monday. While the forecast cone is wider as the hurricane approaches the coast, Google's Sunday morning projections no longer show landfall in Florida, veering north instead toward the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\nRead more: Hurricane Dorian, an 'extremely dangerous' storm, could hit the Bahamas and Florida as a Category 4 hurricane and drop up to 20 inches of rain\n\nBoth Florida and South Carolina have declared states of emergency, with the latter declaring on Saturday in the wake of the new hurricane trajectory. Palm Beach County in southern Florida also ordered a mandatory evacuation Sunday morning of residents in its Zones A and B.\n\nThe emergency state gives the governors the ability to mobilize the National Guard and state agency employees to prepare for the storm, as well as enact anti-price gouging laws and allow for the possibility of federal aid.\n\nNHC forecasters say Dorian's trajectory could change, however, and has proven difficult to predict this week. The Associated Press reports that a low-pressure system could pull the storm north, while a high-pressure system could push the storm closer to south Florida.\n\nAccording to the NHC, Floridians should expect tropical-storm-force winds starting late Sunday. The agency's projections show the storm could make landfall with the state early next week.\n\nNational Hurricane Center\n\nThe NHC projects the storm will weaken as it moves inland.\n\nRead more\n\nState of emergency declared for entire state of Florida as Hurricane Dorian approaches.
