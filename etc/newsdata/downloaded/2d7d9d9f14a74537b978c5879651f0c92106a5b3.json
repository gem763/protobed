It was the site of the worst atrocity in Europe since World War II.\n\nIn an article published in The Guardian in April 1999, journalist Ian Traynor reported that Handke \"claimed that the Muslims had staged their own massacres in Sarajevo and had blamed this on the Serbs.\n\n\"Nor did he believe that Serb troops had butchered thousands of Muslim men at Srebrenica in the summer of 1995.\"\n\nBosnian actor Nermin Tulic, who was seriously injured during the 1992-1995 siege of Sarajevo by Bosnian Serb forces, greeted the award by tweeting an emoticon of a smiley vomiting.\n\nLiberal Sarajevo politician Reuf Bajrovic said he could not understand that a jury thought that \"Handke is a great writer and that his support to Slobo (Milosevic) and genocide makes part of his work great\".\n\nEmir Suljagic, a survivor of the Srebrenica genocide echoed him.\n\n\"A Milosevic fan and notorious genocide-denier gets Nobel prize in literature ... What a time to be alive,\" Suljagic, the Sarajevo-based professor of international relations tweeted.\n\nThe reaction was similar in Kosovo, which was devastated by the 1998-1999 war between Serb forces and pro-independence ethnic Albanian guerillas.\n\n\"Milosevic's supporter and denier of Serbian genocide receives the Nobel Literature Prize,\" the main Koha Ditore newspaper said.\n\nAt the 2006 funeral of Milosevic - who died while on trial for crimes against humanity, and who wanted Handke to testify in his defence - the writer made a speech in front of thousands of mourners.\n\nSome stood up for Handke, including Nobel-winning compatriot Elfriede Jelinek. But many others, from Susan Sontag to Salman Rushdie, lined up to lambast him.\n\n'Dumbfounded'\n\nPen America issued a statement Thursday saying that they \"deeply regret the Nobel Committee on Literature's choice\".\n\n\n\n\"We are dumbfounded by the selection of a writer who has used his public voice to undercut historical truth\n\nand offer public succor to perpetrators of genocide, like former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic,\" it said.\n\n\n\n\"We reject the decision that a writer who has persistently called into question thoroughly documented war crimes deserves to be celebrated for his 'linguistic ingenuity'.\n\n\"At a moment of rising nationalism, autocratic leadership, and widespread disinformation around the world, the literary community deserves better than this.\"\n\nMeanwhile in Serbia, papers hailed that the Nobel Prize was awarded to a \"friend of Serbs\" who is a member of the country's academy of sciences and arts since 2012.", "description": "PEN America slams decision to award literary prize to Austrian author, who has denied the Srebrenica genocide.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/10/80299ff1fa204a638836007c0fcaf1f0_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
