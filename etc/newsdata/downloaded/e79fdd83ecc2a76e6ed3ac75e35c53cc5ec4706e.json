Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the first Black lawmaker to lie in state at the U.S. Capitol, returned home on Friday to his Baltimore district where family, friends and former presidents gathered to honor his legacy as a proponent of civil rights and government accountability.\n\nCummings\u2019 funeral at the city\u2019s New Psalmist Baptist Church, where he occupied a pew for nearly 40 years, was expected to draw thousands of mourners, including presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who started out the service with a scripture reading of Psalm 23.\n\nFormer Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was the first to deliver a personal tribute to the late congressman, punctuated by applause as she praised him for having championed \u201ctruth, justice and kindness in every part of his life.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe pushed back against the abuse of power, he was unwavering in his defense of our democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cEven his political adversaries recognized that it wasn\u2019t really about politics for our Elijah. He led from his soul.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a Baltimore native, followed Clinton\u2019s speech with a testament to Cummings\u2019 ability to embrace bipartisanship, especially when it came to his work to lower prescription drug pricing.\n\n\u201cElijah brought people together in life of different parties,\u201d she said, noting that in his death, he did the same. \u201cHe was willing to reach across the aisle, even across the Capitol and even down Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201d\n\nFormer Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama later stepped up to the podium with remembrances of their own, honoring their longtime colleague and friend.\n\nAmong the most politically poignant speeches was that given by Cummings\u2019 widow, Maryland Democratic Party Chair Dr. Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, who appeared to call out President Donald Trump\u2019s smears of the congressman and his district.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have any challenges like we\u2019ve got going on right now, so his job became harder over time,\u201d she said, referring to Obama\u2019s tenure and adding that her husband was engaged in a \u201cfight for the soul of our democracy against very real corruption.\u201d\n\nAt the time of his death, the congressman was chairing the House Oversight Committee, helming various probes into potential power abuses by the Trump administration. Evidently, the work provoked the president\u2019s ire.\n\nIn July, he referred to the congressman\u2019s majority-Black hometown as a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u201d in a racist Twitter rant on which he refused to let up.\n\n\u201cI want you all to know that it was not easy,\u201d Maya Rockeymoore Cummings said. \u201cAnd it got infinitely more difficult in the last months of his life when he sustained personal attacks, and attacks on his beloved city. And while he carried himself with grace and dignity in all public forums, it hurt him.\u201d\n\nElijah Cummings died on Oct. 17 at age 68 after suffering what his office described as \u201ccomplications concerning longstanding health challenges.\u201d\n\nThough Maya Rockeymoore Cummings acknowledged that her husband had \u201cdictated every aspect of his service\u201d and would not have wanted to be brought to the Capitol on Thursday, she felt \u201cvery strongly that they were trying to tear him down, and we needed to make sure that he went out with the respect and the dignity that he deserved.\u201d", "description": "Friends, family and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama gathered to pay tribute to the congressman in his home district.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db3398e2100005d31ad3ec0.jpeg?cache=liuh8odgvt&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
