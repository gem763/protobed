As with the the U.S. flagship, it\u2019s edited by trustworthy journalists (Ailbhe Malone, to be specific), and the goal is to surface the best versions of the things you are specifically looking for as well as the weird and wonderful stuff you didn\u2019t know you needed. We\u2019ll be sharing some of our hits with readers across the pond but for the most part creating brand-new articles that address the specificity of living in the U.K. (like the German shower squeegee that\u2019s able to tackle London\u2019s \u201chard\u201d water and the honey that cookery author Skye McAlpine buys in bulk at Fortnum\u2019s). Every now and then, we\u2019ll share these foreign discoveries with you all, and until then, tell your British buds about us, and if you find yourself in London in need of a new pair of \u201cpants,\u201d you\u2019ll know where to look.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
