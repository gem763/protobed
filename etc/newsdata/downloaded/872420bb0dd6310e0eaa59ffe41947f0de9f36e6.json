Why Michelle Pfeiffer is a GOAT villain in her 'Maleficent' showdown with Angelina Jolie", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Disney's live-action \u201cMaleficent: Mistress of Evil\u201d is a fantasy adventure that picks up several years after \u201cMaleficent.\u201d Disney\n\nSpoiler alert! The story contains details about the ending of \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.\" Stop reading now if you don't want to know.\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer is the GOAT (Greatest of All Time) when it comes to villainy, as her purr-fect role as Catwoman in 1992's \"Batman Returns\" proved.\n\nSo Pfeiffer was going to be a sure treat as ambitious Queen Ingrith in \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil\" (in theaters now), especially squaring off against Angelina Jolie's dark Maleficent.\n\n\"It is kind of fun,\" says Pfeiffer of going to the dark side.\n\nDirector Joachim Ronning says the actress wanted to play a restrained villain, focusing on her Ingrith's love for her son, Prince Phillip (Harris Dickinson). But he asked her to turn it up a notch.\n\nThis is your last chance to bail. We're heading into spoiler territory.\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer brings the evil as Queen Ingrith in \"Malificent: Mistress of Evil.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\n\"She didn\u2019t want the audience, at first, to know she was the villain at all,\" says Ronning. \"I was joking with her, 'People will have seen the trailer. They will know.' \"\n\nThe first trailer focused on the frosty meeting of Jolie's Maleficent and Pfeiffer's Ingrith as they celebrate Princess Aurora's (Elle Fanning) engagement to Prince Philip. Things get ugly quickly between godmother Maleficent and future mother-in-law Ingrith as they battle for Aurora's affections.\n\nEven Fanning couldn't take her eyes off Pfeiffer and Jolie \"going head-to-head. The tension, you could feel it in the room.\"\n\nAngelina Jolie's Maleficent squares off with Michelle Pfeiffer's Queen Ingrith. (Photo: JAAP BUITENDIJK/DISNEY)\n\nIngrith is revealed to be a cold-blooded killer, taking power in the kingdom and waging war with Maleficent, along with a colony of dark fairies (played by Ed Skrein and Chiwetel Ejiofor), long in hiding from humans.\n\nShe's so evil that Ingrith has an adorable little light fairy captured and killed as part of a beyond-cruel extermination experiment by her henchman Lickspittle (Warwick Davis). It's eye-opening horror, at Ronning's insistence, even if the fairy's demise is shown as a flower-filled return to nature.\n\n\"I\u2019m a little fed up with these movies where there is nothing at stake. People can just come back to life,\" says Ronning. \"I fought a little for that to really show the stakes and that Queen Ingrith is a bad person. It\u2019s all part of her elaborate plan.\"\n\nRonning said he worked with Disney to find a way to show the flower side of fairy death. \"We went many, many rounds on this. You can imagine. They lose their magic, the fairies, and they turn back to nature. So they don\u2019t stop fully existing, but they probably stop having a consciousness.\"\n\nPrince Phillip (Harris Dickinson, left) introduces his fiancee Aurora (Elle Fanning) to dad King John (Robert Lindsay) and Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer) in \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.\" (Photo: JAAP BUITENDIJK)\n\nThe success of the experiment leads to Ingrith inviting the fairies and other magical members of the Moors to the royal wedding and locking them in a church. The fairy-tested airborne killer cloud is then dispersed through a pipe organ. There are fairy casualties before the group manages to escape.\n\nMeanwhile, Aurora and Prince Phillip lead a charge to stop the killing. Peace breaks out like flowers as Ingrith's dark plans and dark heart are revealed.\n\nThere's no final confrontation between Maleficent and Ingrith, but Aurora does find love for her dark godmother again.\n\n\"The queen\u2019s ultimate defeat is when Maleficent and Aurora come back together,\" says Ronning. \"That to me was more important than the two of them (Maleficent and Ingrith), say, sword-fighting.\"\n\nIngrith meets her comeuppance being turned into a goat, complete with pearls, by Maleficent -- so the GOAT becomes a literal portrayal.\n\nElle Fanning's Princess Aurora gets a fairy-tale engagement with Harris Dickinson's Prince Phillip in \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.\" (Photo: JAAP BUITENDIJK/DISNEY)\n\nAurora and Phillip move hastily from battlefield to outdoor wedding, with a stunning dress made by Maleficent. The godmother visits to say goodbye to the newlyweds the morning after, and mentions she'll return for \"the christening.\"\n\nSo is Aurora pregnant? Even Fanning isn't sure about her character, who looks puzzled onscreen by Maleficent's comment.\n\n\u201cHarris and I were looking at each other like, 'Am I pregnant in this scene?' Both of us were looking at each other like, 'What is happening?' We didn\u2019t know. So that look is how I really felt,\" says Fanning. \"I guess Maleficent knows all.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/19/maleficent-2-spoilers-michelle-pfeiffer-angelina-jolie/4012197002/", "description": "Michelle Pfeiffer leaned into evil Queen Ingrith in \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.\" How did she fare in battle with Angelina Jolie?
