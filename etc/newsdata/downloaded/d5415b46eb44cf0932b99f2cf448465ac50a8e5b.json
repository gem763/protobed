(AP) \u2014 \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star Felicity Huffman reported Tuesday to a U.S. prison in California to serve a two-week sentence in a college admissions scandal, a representative said.\n\nA brief statement Tuesday from Huffman\u2019s publicist, the TASC Group, said that she \u201cis prepared to serve the term of imprisonment Judge Talwani ordered as one part of the punishment she imposed for Ms. Huffman\u2019s actions.\u201d A spokesman for the agency refused to be named.\n\nA federal judge in Boston sentenced Huffman last month to 14 days in prison, a $30,000 fine, 250 hours of community service and a year\u2019s probation.\n\nThe Federal Correctional Institution, Dublin is a low-security prison for women in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nHuffman was one of 51 people charged in the scandal, which exposed the lengths to which parents will go to get their children into elite schools and reinforced suspicions that the college admissions process is slanted toward the rich.\n\nHuffman pleaded guilty in May to fraud and conspiracy for paying an admissions consultant $15,000 to have a proctor correct her daughter\u2019s SAT answers.\n\nThe amount Huffman paid is relatively low compared with other alleged bribes in the scheme. Some parents were accused of paying up to $500,000.\n\nThe scandal was the biggest college admissions case ever prosecuted by the Justice Department.\n\nProsecutors said parents schemed to manipulate test scores and bribed coaches to get their children into schools by having them labeled as recruited athletes for sports they didn\u2019t play.\n\nThe correctional facility did not immediately return a phone call Tuesday seeking comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"Desperate Housewives\" star Felicity Huffman reported Tuesday to a U.S. prison in California to serve a two-week sentence in a college admissions scandal, a representative said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/college_admissions-bribery-huffman_99164_c0-160-2100-1385_s1200x700.jpg?79c1760b0360b22c1b1ef4cd8fc529dbf6103c77", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
