Psychodrama beat albums by black midi, Foals, Nao, Little Simz, and others, and joins the likes of other rap winners, including Dizzee Rascal\u2019s Boy in Da Corner and Skepta\u2019s Konnichiwa. Accepting the award, Dave invited his mother up on stage and paid tribute to his brother, who is currently in prison, for inspiring the album.\n\nThis media cannot be played on your device.\n\nThe awards feature live performances from the nominated artists, enjoy all the performances below.
