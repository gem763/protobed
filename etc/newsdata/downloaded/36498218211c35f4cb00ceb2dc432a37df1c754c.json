It originally had 12 months from that date to secure a new business and stay listed.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThe MC Payment RTO was first announced in May 2018.\n\nOther reasons cited by Artivision for the extension were its definitive sales and purchase agreement for the deal, and additional appointments of foreign legal advisers to conduct legal due diligence on MC Payment's foreign subsidiaries and associated company.\n\nThe extension also allows Artivision to stay listed, which is a requirement for completing the deal.\n\nIts controlling shareholder, Ching Chiat Kwong, has also provided a financial undertaking to fund payment of the group's liabilities as and when they are due. This allows Artivision to continue as a going concern until the RTO's completion.\n\nArtivision had in September announced it lowered the maximum total consideration for all shares and convertible bonds issued by MC Payment to about S$93.3 million.\n\nThe acquisition now excluded iFashion Group, an online fashion venture platform that MC Payment had been in the process of acquiring.\n\nArtivision shares last traded at 0.4 Singapore cent on Sept 26.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - CATALIST-LISTED video solutions provider Artivision Technologies has obtained a further six-month extension to complete a reverse takeover (RTO) deal where it will give up a 70 per cent stake in exchange for\u00a0electronic payment and online retail business Mobile Credit Payment (MC Payment). .
