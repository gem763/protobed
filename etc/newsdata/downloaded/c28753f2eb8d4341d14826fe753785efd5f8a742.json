The ongoing challenge that governments face is to find ways to fund municipal budgets while at the same time balancing the perceived fairness between commercial and residential taxpayers.\n\nFor over 16 years, Altus Group has conducted this report analyzing the differing tax ratios between commercial and residential properties. The 2019 report found that eight of the 11 cities surveyed have a commercial rate which is at least double that of the residential tax rate. This means that a commercial property would incur property taxes more than twice the amount of an equally valued residential property, having dramatic impacts on Canadian small businesses.\n\nMontreal, Toronto and Vancouver posted the highest commercial-to-residential ratios in the country, for a twelfth consecutive year. However, Calgary and Montreal saw the highest ratio increases in 2019, indicating a growing burden on commercial rate payers in those cities.\n\nYear-Over-Year Commercial-to-Residential Tax Ratios City 2019 2018 % Change Montreal\n\nToronto\n\nVancouver 3.931\n\n3.703\n\n3.643 3.782\n\n3.783\n\n4.398 3.942\n\n-2.093\n\n-17.166 Quebec City\n\nCalgary\n\nHalifax 3.434\n\n3.310\n\n2.870 3.568\n\n3.056\n\n2.798 -3.749\n\n8.305\n\n2.542 Average 2.838 2.898 -1.353 Ottawa 2.509 2.595 -3.322 Edmonton 2.406 2.443 -1.491 Winnipeg 1.962 1.985 -1.143 Regina 1.742 1.744 -0.126 Saskatoon 1.713 1.722 -0.576\n\n\u201cDespite seeing some major shifts this year, the commercial-to-residential tax ratio is still an issue of relative fairness as we continue to see several cities across Canada shifting the burden of property taxes to business owners,\u201d said Terry Bishop, President of Property Tax Canada at Altus Group. \u201cExpecting businesses to shoulder the same burden while values decline, or taxes increase beyond business growth, is unsustainable. Measures that compress the gap between residential and commercial tax rates are positive steps that can help the viability of all businesses.\u201d\n\nMarket-By-Market Trend Analysis\n\nMontreal\u2019s commercial-to-residential tax ratio first rose above the average in 2008 and has been steadily climbing since, now sitting at 3.93, the highest of all of the cities surveyed.\n\ncommercial-to-residential tax ratio first rose above the average in 2008 and has been steadily climbing since, now sitting at 3.93, the highest of all of the cities surveyed.

Saskatoon continues to show the lowest commercial-to-residential tax ratio at 1.71, a slight decrease from last year.\n\nIncreased Pressure on Small Business\n\nThe rising valuations on commercial properties in Vancouver, Toronto and more recently Montreal, have begun to put more pressure on the sustainability of small commercial businesses. While small retail in these markets is being impacted by rising values, Calgary retailers are being equally impacted, but by declining values. In Calgary, the rapid decline in values of downtown core office buildings has caused a similar redistribution of taxes to small commercial properties which have not declined in value at the same rate.\n\nAlthough each city is addressing this issue with their own unique approach, these solutions will compound the problem of inequities in commercial property taxes and create further disparities in commercial tax rates. Assessment phase-ins and tax mitigation measures such as capping, rebate programs and graduated tax rates, only serve to compound the existing inequities in taxation and prolong the inevitable tax increases. Reducing the gap between residential and commercial tax rates is a measure that can help the viability of all businesses.\n\nA copy of the Altus Group 2019 Canadian Property Tax Rate Benchmark Report can be downloaded at https://www.altusgroup.com/services/en-ca/resources/reports/canadian-property-tax-rate-benchmark-report-2019\n\nAbout Altus Group Limited\n\nAltus Group Limited is a leading provider of software, data solutions and independent advisory services to the global commercial real estate industry.
