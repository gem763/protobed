One of its central conceits was that two siblings who had lost a parent would speak in one voice, for each other, against each other, in a state of play. A language game of ever-mourning. For them, time was unfixed. Their childhoods, their growing into teenagers then adults, their notional futures as parents and as dead men themselves, this was all present in the nowness of their storytelling.\n\nThese children were an autobiographical device. I had been trying to find a way of writing about what it is like to lose a parent. About growing up in cahoots with my time-travelling co-conspirator (my brother) along our illusory and twisting lateral axis, backwards and make-believe-forwards, about what seemed like a distinct way we had of seeing other people, granted to us by the absence. To us it seemed as if we had our own time and our own sight, defined by what we shared. And I had wanted to write about that, in an attempt to better grasp it.\n\nI had been to interview the poet Alice Oswald. Afterwards, she read my novel and wrote to me. She said she had identified in the book some truth, as regards grief: \u201cI\u2019m not really a fiction reader so the first thing I look for in any writing is its truth ... I\u2019m interested in the being of grief not the feeling of grief.\u201d\n\nShe asked if I had read Denise Riley\u2019s essay on atemporality, on mourning and time. I hadn\u2019t. All I knew of it was that it related to the astonishing poem \u201cA Part Song\u201d. It is a long poem about maternal grief. It is about elegy, but rages against the elegiac mode, and takes its reader on an extraordinary journey.\n\nA few weeks later Riley\u2019s book Time Lived, Without Its Flow arrived. I found that it was an essay about the being of grief. Its subject therefore is not death, but arrested time. Riley\u2019s project is to describe and interrogate \u201cthat acute sensation of being cut off from any temporal flow after the sudden death of your child\u201d. It is an essay about minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years. It is also an essay that gathers into itself the poetry, philosophy and being grief of others.\n\nAfter reading it, I sat for some time with the small book in my hands marvelling that so few pages could have such an impact, could contain so much. I felt sure that I had emerged from the final pages quite changed, and I was grateful. A reader is changed by any text, but here the alteration felt fundamental. I felt I might never read poetry the same way again, and I felt I finally had some clarity about what happens to us who are still here when someone is suddenly gone. I can think of only a handful of works of art which have had such an instantaneous and welcome impact on me. Truthfully, I might have thrown my own book in the bin had it not already gone to the printers.\n\nLater, I discovered that Time Lived, Without Its Flow is one of those books that has been handed from reader to reader like a secret. Many people have told me that they were looking for something \u2013 as the poet who doesn\u2019t read much fiction was looking for truth \u2013 and that they found it in this essay. I feel the same. Simply put, I was looking for a literary account of bereavement that did more than recreate or reshuffle existing (at best inadequate or boring, at worst idiotic or hopelessly sentimental) ways of writing about grief. I was looking for non-fiction burnished to the point of poetic intensity. I was looking for writing that carried in the very texture of its lines the remade relationship between a person gone and a person remaining. Not about grief, but fashioned of it and for it.\n\nMax Porter.

It has the focused clarity of a recitation. It is profoundly powerful without so much as a whiff of melodrama. As with Riley\u2019s poems, one needs to read certain lines over and over because of the sheer quality and complexity of the thinking within.\n\nReflecting on the \u201cpaucity of accounts\u201d of the arrested time she is experiencing, Riley asks: \u201cWherever is the literature \u2013 for it must exist, it\u2019s needed \u2013 that deals closely with this strange arresting of time?\u201d My pulse quickened when I read this. This had been my question too. And her asking is so deftly personal, and so clear, it reminds me (this can\u2019t be coincidence, or a wishful trick of tonal transference) of my mum. And of my grandmother. It is a way of speaking that is part and parcel of maternal authority and experience. It both subtly contains and moves past a vocabulary of pain in the same quick gesture. It\u2019s the brisk sureness of \u201cit must exist\u201d combined with the open-hearted simplicity of how much it is \u201cneeded\u201d. How unusual to state so calmly in a critical context what is needed.\n\nIt struck me as deliciously un-English (as jouissance is, as analysis is?). And it struck me as absolutely correct. \u201cYes!\u201d I felt like screaming, \u201cSee? We need it!\u201d How startling and unusual is Riley\u2019s singular manner of essayism, which balances desire and theoretical rigour so generatively. It\u2019s deep mastery. And then there\u2019s her answer, which is to go on and make it. A literature of consolation. To create what doesn\u2019t exist. Through and with poetry, because it is poetry that best deals with the \u201cserious problems of what\u2019s describable\u201d.\n\nRiley shows us that the 'time of the dead is, from now on, contained within your own\n\nRiley has the scalpel-fine touch of a literary surgeon. And that she has turned this sharp tool on herself, on the writer in the world reckoning with classical agony the no-return of her son, means that this is literary criticism as love, and I have always hoped such a thing might exist, just as the poet hoped truth in fiction might exist. And Riley shows us how, in what ways, tentatively or objectively, this must be a maternal project. A continuation of the relationship she had with a living son. She shows us that the \u201ctime of the dead is, from now on, contained within your own\u201d. Her son\u2019s time is her own. What a wonderful idea. What a vital corrective to banal narratives of \u201cmoving on\u201d, this radically un-deathly conception of an altered life. What a promise this might be to the living, that we will contain their time within our own once they are gone. \u201cTime is the person,\u201d she writes. How much brighter, wilder and more essential this feels as a formulation than any \u201cblandly containing\u201d concept of mourning.\n\nIn contemplating Riley\u2019s hesitant portrait of a maternal temporality, I wondered if I might begin to grope my way towards a paternal or fraternal way of holding the still living and the dead together, enduringly related. Sharing time. I understood that this might not necessarily be an esoteric or rarefied thing, or even a literary thing, but a straightforward, domestic thing. A manifestation of care. I could see a way to think it through. Riley\u2019s essay is a permission giver. Each reader runs off with it, like Tom into the garden after the clock has struck 13. Ghost siblings, parents, friends, grandparents, the distant lives of others. The grief of groups, of nation states. From such a stunningly compelling analysis, for each of us, a way of being in the broken clock of the world might emerge. In times of spasmodic political upheaval, or extremism of opinion on national matters, I always think of Riley\u2019s transpersonal \u201cgenerational temporalities\u201d. In Riley\u2019s delicate formation we might mourn better. We might speak to each other and make sense of things better if we know better how we are living with the dead.\n\nThis is not a sweet book, or an easy book, but I consider it to be a radically kind book. At the start of \u201cA Part Song\u201d, Riley asks: \u201cYou principle of song, what are you for now ...\u201d I have sat with this book, and with Riley\u2019s poems, and I have felt the critical sometimes angry dead read with me, and I have thought slantwise and differently about myself and them and others, and seen light in areas I had wanted to be flooded dark. And I have rejoiced and rushed to share the song with others. That is what it\u2019s for.\n\n\u2022 A new edition of Time Lived, Without Its Flow is published by Picador on 3 October.
