The Times reported that this means the children will continue to use an aging, existing building where teachers use mobile carts to store books and homework due to the lack of classroom space.\n\nTeachers at the Mahaffey Middle School currently cram multiple ongoing lessons into each classroom, and force some students to eat in the library because the cafeteria isn't big enough, The Times reported.\n\nRead more: The Pentagon is deferring work on 127 construction projects in order to fund Trump's wall on the US-Mexico border\n\nA Helicopter from the Customs and Border Protection Office flies over the US-Mexico Border wall on April 5, 2019 in Mexicali, Mexico.

Jim Cooper, a Democrat, called the move a \"funding grab\" that would deprive the young children of US troops.\n\n\"President Trump has stooped to new lows in trying to illegally fund more border wall,\" Cooper said in a statement to the local CBS affiliate WTVF. \"Our troops and their families deserve better... President Trump should not be hurting the troops with young children at Fort Campbell this way.\"", "description": "The middle school is one of 127 military construction projects that Defense Department officials said this week would be delayed or halted.", "authors": ["Michelle Mark"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cd88ee1021b4c094d6820f2-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
