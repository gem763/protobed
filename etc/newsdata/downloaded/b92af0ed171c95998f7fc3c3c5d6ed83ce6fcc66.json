Make sure your phone is connected to the internet. You might need to reset your network settings, which control how your iPhone connects to your cellular network and Wi-Fi.\n\n2. Try logging into your email on a different device, or check with your email service provider to ensure that the system isn't temporarily down.\n\n3. Note that backing up your mail through iCloud or iTunes only backs up your email settings, not individual emails. If you edit or delete your email account settings, emails that were previously downloaded onto your phone may be removed.\n\nCheck that your email address and password are entered correctly\n\nOne of the most common problems with email is that your password is incorrect \u2014 if you changed your password on another device, you'll need to change it on your iPhone, too.\n\nWhen the Mail application prompts you to re-enter your password, ensure that you've entered it correctly.\n\nCheck iOS Mail Fetch\n\nYour phone's default settings for fetching new emails are based on the settings available through your email provider. If your provider doesn't support Push notifications (where emails are sent to your phone as they arrive, in real time), it will automatically enable Fetch (where your phone retrieves emails regularly at preset times).\n\nThese settings impact how your phone receives emails. To adjust them:\n\n1. Open \"Settings.\"\n\n2. Tap \"Passwords and Accounts.\"\n\nYour Push notifications setting can affect how you receive emails. Isabella Paoletto/Business Insider\n\n3. Scroll to the bottom and hit \"Fetch New Data.\"\n\nTap \"Fetch New Data\" at the bottom of the page. Isabella Paoletto/Business Insider\n\n4. There, you'll be able to enable \"Push\" and can control how often data is \"fetched.\"\n\nPush notifications are now enabled. Isabella Paoletto/Business Insider\n\nCheck your Mail settings\n\nCheck that Apple has the right account settings for your email server provider.\n\nThough Apple automatically sets these, users can check that they're correct. To do this:\n\n1. Go to \"Settings\" and click \"Passwords and Accounts.\"\n\n2. Select your email account, and then tap on it again at the top of the next page to see the account settings.\n\nTap on the email account that you're having issues with. Isabella Paoletto/Business Insider\n\n3. There, you'll be able to see the incoming and outgoing mail servers. Compare these to the recommended settings via Apple's Mail Settings Lookup widget.\n\nCheck your notification settings\n\nThere's a chance you might be receiving emails without being notified. To ensure that you're receiving the email notifications you want, check your notification settings. To do this:\n\n1. Go to \"Settings\" and select \"Notifications.\"\n\nSelect \"Notifications\" from the Settings menu. Isabella Paoletto/Business Insider\n\n2. Hit \"Mail.\"\n\nTap \"Mail\" from your list of apps. Isabella Paoletto/Business Insider\n\n3. Select the email account.\n\nSelect the email account that you're troubleshooting. Isabella Paoletto/Business Insider\n\n4. Turn notification settings on or off and adjust alerts, sounds, and badges.\n\nChoose the notifications that work best for you on this screen. Isabella Paoletto/Business Insider\n\nCheck your outbox\n\nIf you're not getting emails, you might not be able to send them either.\n\nAfter you troubleshoot your email settings, check your Outbox, which stores unsent messages, to ensure that everything has sent properly.\n\nTo do this:\n\n1. Open your Mail app and hit \"Mailboxes\" in the upper-left corner\n\n2. Find the Outbox folder and select it. If there are no messages in your Outbox, your phone may not display an Outbox folder.\n\n4. If you're able to open your Outbox and see your unsent email, tap it to ensure that the recipient's email address is correct.\n\n5. Tap \"Send\" to try sending again.\n\nIf all else fails, contact your email provider or system administrator for additional troubleshooting assistance.\n\nRelated coverage from How To Do Everything: Tech:", "description": "There are a number of reasons why your iPhone might not allow you to receive emails, including incorrect mail settings.", "authors": ["Kelly Laffey"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db21436dee0192bc539cf04?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
