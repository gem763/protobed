Because of FareShare, we can now open up the workshops at a low cost to low income families.\u2019\n\nCritics of the Oxfam report said such meals are not going to people who are too poor to feed themselves.\n\n\u2018The largest share comes from FareShare,\u2019 a source close to Mr Duncan Smith said.\n\n\u2018FareShare redistribute food from supermarkets to around 1300 charities and community groups, which is then used in places such as community cafes, domestic violence refuges and elderly drop-in centres.\n\n\u2018This supports charities by helping them to keep their costs down while cutting down on food waste - which is clearly very different to provision of emergency food aid through foodbanks.\u2019\n\nMost of the remainder of the meals suppled were 8,218,242 provided by the food bank operator the Trussell Trust. The Trust hands out packages of food to last people three days, which the Oxfam report calculated as nine meals.\n\nIt is unknown how many people claimed the 900,000 or so packages provided by the Trust, because it counts only the number of food parcels handed out and takes no account of numbers of repeat visits.", "description": "Sources close to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith have disputed the charities\u2019 figures, which claim 500,000 children are not receiving an acceptable diet.", "authors": ["Steve Doughty For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/08/article-2652367-186E668700000578-606_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2014-06-08"}
