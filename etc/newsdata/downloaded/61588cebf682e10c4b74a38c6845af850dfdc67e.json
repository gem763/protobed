His nickname was Old Bacon Face.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nThis engraved portrait of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase appears to lack the reddish-brown complexion that earned him the moniker \"Old Bacon Face.\"\n\nCalls to impeach Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh came from at least four Democratic presidential candidates over the weekend as the New York Times revealed a third alleged incident of sexual misconduct when Kavanaugh was a young man.\n\nIf the House voted for an impeachment trial, Kavanaugh wouldn\u2019t have a lot of company in the ranks of justices past. Only one other justice has ever been impeached, and it was more than 200 years ago.\n\nSamuel Chase was a frequent subject of the rumor mill for his entire life. As a young lawyer in Annapolis, Md., in the 1760s, he was expelled from a debating society for \u201cextremely irregular and indecent\u201d behavior. He was also an early critic of the Stamp Act, and headed up Anne Arundel County\u2019s chapter of the Sons of Liberty.\n\nHis height and broadness added to his gruff and intimidating personality. He also had a reddish-brown complexion, earning him the nickname \u201cOld Bacon Face\u201d \u2014 which some might consider its own impeachable offense.\n\nIn 1776, Chase signed the Declaration of Independence representing Maryland. By the 1780s, he had moved to Baltimore, where he rose through the ranks as a judge.\n\nPresident George Washington nominated Chase to the Supreme Court in 1796. At the time though, the highest court in the land had little to do, so justices still served on lower courts.\n\nAnd those lower courts are where Chase\u2019s problems arose.\n\n[George Washington's Supreme Court nominees were confirmed in two days. Only half showed up to work.]\n\nWhile presiding over the 1800 sedition trial of Thomas Cooper, Chase railed against Cooper during his instructions to the jury, seeming to act more as a prosecutor than a judge.\n\nBefore a treason trial in Philadelphia, he showed defense attorneys his opinion before the trial had even taken place. He later sentenced the man to death. (President John Adams pardoned him.)\n\nAt a sedition trial in Richmond, he sat a juror who said he had already made up his mind that the defendant was guilty.\n\nAnd while presiding over a grand jury in Delaware, Chase angrily refused to dismiss a grand jury after they declined to charge a man with sedition.\n\nLater that same year, he campaigned for Adams\u2019s reelection \u2014 an overtly partisan move that caught the ire of Democratic Republicans and their victorious candidate, Thomas Jefferson.\n\n[The thin-skinned president who made it illegal to criticize his office]\n\nIn a 2003 speech, former chief justice William H. Rehnquist put it like this: \u201cChase was one of those people who are intelligent and learned, but seriously lacking in judicial temperament.\u201d\n\nOnce they had the reins of power, the Democratic Republicans overturned a law that had created lower courts in a bid to limit the power of Federalist judges installed by Adams.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop Chase. In 1803, before a Baltimore jury, Chase denounced the Democratic Republicans for overturning the law.\n\nWhen Jefferson found out about it, he sent a letter to a congressman friend of his strongly suggesting that \u2014 cough cough, hint hint \u2014 only Congress could do something about Chase.\n\nThe next year, the House voted 73-32 to impeach him, charging that he \u201ctend[ed] to prostitute the high judicial character with which he was invested.\u201d\n\n[That time a Supreme Court nominee was rumored to have killed a man \u2014 and sailed to confirmation]\n\nThe Senate trial took place in February 1805. Over 10 days, senators heard from more than 50 witnesses, according to Rehnquist. Chase maintained that he could not be impeached for poor judgment but only indictable offenses.\n\nTwo-thirds majorities were needed to convict on each of the eight articles of impeachment. If the votes had gone strictly down party lines, Democratic Republicans would have had more than enough; at the time, they dominated the Senate 25 to nine, according to the Senate Historical Office.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t how the votes went. Though majorities found Chase guilty on three of the eight articles, none passed the two-thirds threshold.\n\nOld Bacon Face had dodged the frying pan.\n\nAnd a precedent had been set, Rehnquist said, that \u201ca judge\u2019s judicial acts may not serve as a basis for impeachment.\u201d\n\nIn more than 220 years, only eight federal judges have ever been removed from office via impeachment, according to House records \u2014 all for serious charges outside of court proceedings, such as perjury, tax evasion and, in one case, joining the Confederacy.\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\n\u2018The time has come\u2019: The fraught history of lifetime tenure for Supreme Court justices\n\nDear Democrats: FDR\u2019s court-packing scheme was a \u2018humiliating\u2019 defeat\n\nThat time a Supreme Court nominee was rumored to have killed a man \u2014 and sailed to confirmation\n\nGeorge Washington\u2019s Supreme Court nominees were confirmed in two days.
