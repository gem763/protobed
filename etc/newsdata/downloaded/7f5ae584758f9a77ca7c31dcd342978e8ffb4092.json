Throwing it actively and accurately, the development of the former champion\u2019s jab dates back to the beginning of her career and has been a crucial tool for her success.\n\nLike many muay Thai strikers transitioning into MMA, Jedrzejczyk was extra mindful of takedowns early on, subsequently avoiding throwing kicks comfortably until her very first UFC strawweight title defense. Now, showing competence and confidence in her anti-grappling abilities, the 32-year-old pro will use her jab more for setups rather than safety, confidently attaching well-placed leg kicks and punches to punctuate her presence.\n\nStill, despite Jedrzejczyk\u2019s ability to damage legs, she may have to alter her approach when facing a fighter who actively switches stances and carries takedown threats in their back pocket.\n\nA karate practitioner since the age of 10, Michelle Waterson is no stranger to the kicks that reside in the striking realm. Competing in MMA for over a decade, Waterson has shown slightly different iterations of her arsenal throughout the years, steadily evolving from her original base of American-freestyle karate.\n\nIncorporating more muay Thai in the later parts of her career, Waterson displays an ability to delegate her kicking styles uniquely.\n\nLike many karate strikers, the 12-year pro works well off of her lead leg, and she throws the front and round kicks you would expect from a fighter with that background. Waterson can also seamlessly switch her kicking style, often parlaying missed Thai kicks into sidekicks.\n\nHowever, when it comes to counters, both ladies are not beyond being hit at boxing range \u2013 which makes the pocket the place where this battle\u2019s trajectory could change.\n\nNext point of interest: Conquering the clinch", "description": "MMA Junkie fight analyst Dan Tom breaks down the UFC Tampa main event as Joanna Jedrzejczyk takes on Michelle Waterson.", "authors": ["Dan Tom", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bd-ufc-on-espn-19-main.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
