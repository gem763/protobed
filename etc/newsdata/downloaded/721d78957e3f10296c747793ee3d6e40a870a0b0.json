The forum will be webcast across the country.\n\nCBA says it has made changes to fees and charges that saw the bank forgo $275 million in revenue, such as connecting its customers with $150 million in rebates and other benefits.\n\nA spokesman for ANZ said while the ACCC mortgage pricing report showed the discounts for interest-only loans had narrowed, the discounts for principal and interest loans had grown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvans & Partners analyst Matthew Wilson sounded a warning on back book profits in a note to clients last week, saying that as interest rates fell towards zero more borrowers would be compelled to compare prices in the market.\n\nMr Wilson said net interest income was worth around 76 per cent of total revenue and growing as the banks discard non-core assets. He estimated the benefits of back book pricing to be worth 12 basis points (bps) to ANZ, 15 bps to CBA, 10 bps to NAB and 18 bps to Westpac.\n\n\u201cBased on our analysis, average sector net interest margin could fall 26 basis points to 1.68 per cent, which equates to an average sector return on equity of 8.6 per cent.\u201d\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg said there were similarities between the banks and energy providers where customers are punished for being loyal.\n\nAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims said the regulator identified the issue with loyalty in a 2018 report and the longer a customer stayed with a bank \u201cthe more out of kilter it seems to become\u201d.\n\nMr Frydenberg said there were similarities between the banks and the energy providers where customers of both are punished for being loyal.\n\nHe said banks were happy \u201cleaving their existing customers in the cold\u201d to win new business but stopped short of recommending a default market offer-style mechanism for mortgages, similar to the model introduced into the energy sector to stop providers profiting off customer inertia.\n\nThe opaque nature of mortgage pricing has also attracted the attention of the Productivity Commission, which recommended a Fuel Watch-style website where customers could easily compare rates on offer.\n\nThe recommendation has been endorsed by the Council of Financial Regulators which said last week it was developing an online tool based on APRA data which would provide information on average interest rates for new mortgages.", "description": "Banks say they are doing more than ever to look after loyal customers as analysis reveals customer inertia contributes $3.1 billion in profit annually.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4814%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_86/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0dcffe3da36ca3a81b7b7901189576ea8130ffda", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
