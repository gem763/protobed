Britain\u2019s exit had been envisaged for Oct. 31.\n\nBut Johnson added another note saying he was opposed to an extension and British government minister Michael Gove said on Sunday Brexit will happen by Oct. 31 as the government seeks to get the Brexit bill through the parliament.\n\nAnalysts said the market focus will turns to this week\u2019s vote on Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC overnight that he was confident enough lawmakers would back the deal this week.\n\n\u201cThe weekend\u2019s events, if anything, have further reduced the risk of disorderly exit,\u201d said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in London.\n\n\u201cIf there is a knee-jerk negative reaction in the pound as we emerge from the weekend with a greater overhang of uncertainty than hoped and some of the long positions are unwound, it should be faded soon.\u201d\n\nThe European Union will play for time rather than rush to decide on London\u2019s reluctant request to delay Brexit again, diplomats said on Sunday.\n\nWhile weary of the Brexit process, EU leaders are keen to avoid a disorderly exit and are unlikely to reject the request. They hope the deal can eventually be approved in London.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS.N) said on Sunday that it lowered the probability of a no-deal Brexit to 5% from 10% and maintained its baseline view that the UK will leave the EU on Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty is likely to weigh on sterling when trading resumes in Asia Pacific on Oct. 21. Volatility will remain elevated until a clearer picture emerges,\u201d said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York.\n\nThe euro eased 0.15% to $1.1155 EUR= versus the greenback, off Friday's two-month high of $1.1172.\n\nThe dollar was little changed at 108.41 JPY= to the safe-haven yen, still not far from its 2-1/2-month high of 108.94 yen marked on Thursday.", "description": "Sterling fell over half a percent against the dollar on Monday, slipping from five-month highs after the British parliament delayed a crucial vote on a Brexit withdrawal agreement.", "authors": ["Tomo Uetake", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443158701&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K016", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
