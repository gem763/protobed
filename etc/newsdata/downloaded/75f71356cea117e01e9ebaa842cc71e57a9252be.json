The best credit card deals also deliver generous rewards rates on regular spending, so you can continue to earn cash back for years to come.\n\nIllustration by Tim Boelaars More\n\nCash back cards have evolved in recent years, so if you haven\u2019t checked out what\u2019s being offered lately, you might be in for a pleasant surprise. \u201cA few years back, the primary way to try and hook us was those big intro offers,\u201d says Brian Karimzad, co-founder of MagnifyMoney.com. \u201cNow, they\u2019re investing more in the ongoing category rewards for cards.\u201d\n\nOf course, which rewards card is really the best for you may depend on your spending habits. For instance, the best cash back credit cards for groceries might not benefit you much if you\u2019re a city dweller who subsists primarily on takeout. Likewise, accelerated earnings for hotel stays and airfare might not be as useful if you hardly ever travel.\n\nEvaluating the best credit cards means taking a lot of factors into consideration, from how simple it is to earn and redeem rewards, to whether or not you\u2019ll be charged an annual fee, to what kind of APR you can get.\n\nIllustration by Tania Guerra More\n\nKey Terms\n\n\u2022Rewards: 2.5% cash back on all purchases\n\n\u2022Annual fee: $99, waived first year\n\n\u2022APR: 12.24%-15.24%\n\nWhy It\u2019s a Winner\n\nWhile there are lots of great cards in the cash back category, we found this one offers the most compelling value. The current signup promotion is a 3% cash back rate for all your spending in the first year \u2014 a potentially sizable perk if you charge a lot or plan to use this as your primary card. If you put $2,000 a month on the card, you\u2019d earn $720 in rewards. (After year one, you\u2019ll earn 2.5% cash back.) This card also has one of the lowest interest rates in the cash back category, according to MagnifyMoney\u2019s database.\n\nCaveats/Alternatives\n\nIf an annual fee is an absolute dealbreaker, you might want to check out the Citi Double Cash (see our profile of it here), which offers 2% cash back \u2014 1% when you spend, then another 1% when you pay off your purchases.\n\nAlso, you\u2019ll need to join Alliant Credit Union in order to apply for its Visa Signature card. If you don\u2019t qualify based on any of the other criteria, you can join Alliant\u2019s partner charity, Foster Care to Success, for a $5 donation and become eligible for membership.", "description": "This cards generous ongoing rewards across spending categories are well worth the $99 annual fee.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wquZfrB_vSu0wOI.lkYK6w--~B/aD0xOTkyO3c9Mjg4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/a7d004b66c8c6ca0b2e676b6ecf6cf2f", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
