But let\u2019s go with the broad classification of non-fiction and fit \u201cTime Song\u201d into it.\n\nPartly it\u2019s a memoir of the author\u2019s fascination with the drowned terrain of Doggerland and the animals and humans who lived there in past eons. This leads her into paleontology, paleoclimatology and much more about the very distant past. Yet she is alert to the present, and wonderful at describing the birds and plants and topography of the watery lands where her explorations take place.\n\nShe notes the oddity of her topics herself, explaining, \u201cTrying to see through the fact of absence is what this book is mostly about.\u201d\n\nThe book is full of absences. Doggerland itself is one. It was the antediluvian chunk of Eurasia that connected the British Isles to that vast continent. Doggerland now lies under the forbidding grey North Sea. But when it was above the waves it was \u201ca paradise for cave lions, sabre-tooth tigers, bears, bison but mammoth were by far the most common animal,\u201d according to one of Julia Blackburn\u2019s informants.\n\nShe writes, \u201cI must imagine great herds of them grazing, drinking from the rivers, and in the summer month of July walrus hunting for clams and molluscs in the soft mud along the coast and beluga whale breeding in the shelter of the estuaries.\u201d\n\nConjuring this scene would not have been hard because years of beachcombing had yielded her numerous bits of mammoth bone. She had also found bones of rhinoceros and deer and bear, fossils of clams and sea creatures, and most significantly flints and bones worked into tools once used by humans \u2014 all these on the east coast of England.\n\nMaking such discoveries is easier than it may sound. The cliffs and dunes of this eastern shore are constantly worn away or broken off by storms, exposing the remains of long-buried creatures or caches of tools made by the people who hunted and gathered in these parts. Much of the land that the sea sweeps up is deposited further south, and so the coastline is ever-changing, and every beach for dozens of miles can be scattered with ancient remains for those with eyes to spot them.\n\nAmong these are professional academic researchers, who avidly explore this region, but a huge number of skilled amateurs do so too, and many have made important discoveries. Among them the author describes Bob Mutch, who having suffered a neurological disorder, took to walking Suffolk beaches to strengthen his muscles, and began discovering bones and flints.\n\nJulia Blackburn describes him working with his autistic friend Adrian: \u201cBob wasn\u2019t strong and he would just prop himself on the sand and watch and sort out the material as it was brought to him. Adrian always had a bottle of brandy and blackcurrant juice against the cold and he would wade out into the sea to sift the gravel where a river had once flowed. Nothing could stop him, he\u2019d go on working in a howling gale, even if the waves were coming in waist-high. He\u2019d go on like that for hours.\u201d\n\nAfter seven weeks of this work they discovered flints that were shown to be 700,000 years old, and therefore of major historical significance because they were \u201cthe earliest evidence of human habitation in Great Britain.\u201d\n\nThese first residents fascinate the author. She visualizes them movingly, imagining them hunting caribou or making flints or preparing food. Like the great herds of animals, they are among the \u201cabsences\u201d that her books is about.\n\nAnother vital one is her husband. On an early page she notes his decease. Later, brief references recall him; then at the end of the book she writes about his death and how she and her friend painted his coffin in bright colors. So, this book is about mortality: The deaths of those we know and love, as well as the too-big-to-count myriad of animals and insects and sea creatures and people who once lived.\n\nJulia Blackburn studs her book with poems she calls \u201cTime Songs\u201d illustrated with odd monochrome drawings by Enrique Brinkmann. She explains these \u201csongs\u201d as a way of handling material that would be boring in expository prose. In the last one, she addresses her husband on the anniversary of his death, writing \u201cI think it\u2019s all right/ The world will continue/ even if we have gone/ and that is surely something/ to smile about.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s wisdom here and throughout her book. Most importantly she makes vast periods of time credible by her descriptions of landscapes and fossils and ancient artifacts Most amazingly, in her beautifully imagined scenery and activity of a world that has long passed under the waves she persuades us that it is still there \u2014 just absent.\n\n\u2022 Claire Hopley is a writer and editor in Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nTIME SONG: JOURNEYS IN SEARCH OF A SUBMERGED LAND\n\nBy Julia Blackburn\n\nPantheon, $27.95, 304 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
