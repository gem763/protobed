He wants to be a great, studly guy, that looks good and is muscular, doesn\u2019t have a gut sticking out\u2014all of those things.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Schwarzenegger\u2019s qualms about Trump are more than some petty personal spat. He\u2019s among the most vocal Never Trump Republicans, criticizing the president on a host of issues, from Trump\u2019s racist tweet telling four congresswomen of color to \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from, to\u2014as Schwarzenegger put it in a Washington Post op-ed earlier this month\u2014Trump\u2019s attempts to \u201cerase a decade of clean-air progress with a Sharpie.\u201d\n\nApart from his ongoing feud with Trump, Schwarzenegger has been on a crusade in recent years to end partisan gerrymandering, the controversial practice by which state legislatures draw electoral maps that are skewed toward one political party. It\u2019s a practice that only seems to be becoming more intense, as statistical advancements have allowed mapmakers to pinpoint exactly where Democratic and Republican voters live. In the 2018 midterms, for example, according to The New York Times, Democrats in North Carolina got 48.3 percent of the total vote in House races, but won just three out of 12 seats in the state.\n\nGerrymandering \u201cis the evil of all evils,\u201d Schwarzenegger said, adding that it leads to incumbents in Congress getting reelected again and again, and doesn\u2019t encourage bipartisanship.\n\nRead: Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s war on gerrymandering is just beginning\n\nIn 2018, the former governor backed the creation of independent redistricting commissions in four states where they were up for a vote as ballot measures, and he hit the campaign trail in Michigan and Colorado trying to sell them to voters there. All four measures passed. This year, he launched an organization called the Fair Maps Incubator that\u2019s spun out from the Schwarzenegger Institute at the University of Southern California.\n\nGerrymandering isn\u2019t a new pet issue for him: In 2008, during his tenure as governor, California passed a law that handed off redistricting to a nonpartisan commission in the state.\n\nWith 2020 on the horizon, advocates like Schwarzenegger are running out of time to get states engaged in ending partisan gerrymandering: Since redistricting happens only once a decade, if states don\u2019t create independent commissions by 2020, they\u2019ll have to wait another 10 years to adjust their maps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the politicians that are looking for voters,\u201d Schwarzenegger said, \u201crather than the voters picking the politicians \u2026 It took 200 years, but people are finally waking up to this scam.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t mince words when talking about the president, either. Discussing Trump\u2019s occasional attacks, Schwarzenegger said he\u2019s unbothered. \u201cI think it\u2019s perfectly okay,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have to take it with a sense of humor. And then it gives me a chance to say something back to him.\u201d\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
