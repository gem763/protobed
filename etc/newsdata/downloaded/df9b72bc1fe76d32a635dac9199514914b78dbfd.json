Now we have answers.\n\n\u201cSalvator Mundi,\u201d which is rumored to be owned by Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi prince who the CIA believes ordered the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, is not in the show. The exquisite \u201cBenois Madonna,\u201d which travels from its home at the Hermitage in St. Petersburg exceedingly rarely, is. The unfinished \u201cSaint Jerome,\u201d seen recently in New York, has been lent by the Vatican, and a soulful portrait of a young musician, from Milan, has also made the trip.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2012, the National Gallery in London mounted a show focused on Leonardo\u2019s years as a court artist in Milan, and the highlight of that exhibition was the juxtaposition of its \u201cVirgin of the Rocks\u201d (which may have been made in collaboration with Leonardo\u2019s assistants) with a version from the Louvre. But the London painting has not traveled to Paris, lending force to then National Gallery Director Nicholas Penny\u2019s prediction that it was a once-in-a-lifeime pairing \u201cunlikely ever to be repeated.\u201d\n\nSo Leonardo completists who come to Paris with a checklist may be disappointed. But take one step past the fame of the Mona Lisa (which is on view at the Louvre in another gallery) and a wholly different and more interesting Leonardo emerges. That Leonardo is well represented in all his brilliance and richness.\n\nMany of the artist\u2019s most important drawings and sketches are in the show, including the large format and emotionally incandescent Burlington House cartoon (depicting the Virgin, Saint Anne, and the infant Christ and John the Baptist), the rigorous perspective drawing for the unfinished \u201cAdoration of the Magi\u201d and the stunning painted drapery sketches made in the earliest years of his career. The most famous drawing of them all, the Vitruvian Man (a naked male figure inscribed in a circle and a square), wasn\u2019t yet on the wall after a last-minute legal battle over its departure from Italy. But the unattached label was leaning against the blank panel on which it will be hung.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOnly one major episode of Leonardo\u2019s life isn\u2019t covered in depth: the story of the enormous bronze equestrian statue made for his patron Ludovico Sforza, the clay model of which was supposedly blown apart by French soldiers after they stormed Milan in 1499. But the rest of his life is fully present. Visitors are greeted by the great masterpiece of his teacher, Andrea del Verrocchio\u2019s monumental bronze \u201cChrist and Saint Thomas\u201d (as overwhelming as anything else in the show), and are sent home with the memory of a work by one of his most talented and devoted pupils, Francesco Melzi\u2019s iconic portrait of an elderly, bearded and benignly careworn Leonardo, made in the last years of the master\u2019s life.\n\nIn between, works by contemporaries complicate superficial ideas about his meteoric genius, and small, delicate drawings teem with an abundance of ideas \u2014 paintings never made, thoughts adumbrated then abandoned. Under low light, these faded, wispy clippings from the cutting-room floor suggest a superfluity of ideas that might have supplied a lifetime of inspiration to other artists. All aspects of his life as an artist, scholar, scientist, engineer, military adviser and archaeologist are documented in drawings.\n\nThere are, on this planet, only about 15 extant paintings confidently attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, and if you were to mark their locations with pins on a map, you would have a reliable record of several of the Western world\u2019s lost or fading empires.\n\nThe \u201cBenois Madonna,\u201d from St. Petersburg, was bought by Czar Nicholas II for what was then a record price in 1914, only four years before he and his family were gunned down in a basement room far from their former palaces. There is an early portrait of Ginevra de\u2019 Benci, in Washington, which was for a long time the only Leonardo painting outside Europe when the National Gallery of Art acquired it in 1967 at the height of the space race (it never travels and isn\u2019t in the Paris show). And the United Kingdom has \u201cThe Virgin of the Rocks,\u201d which it acquired in the 18th century.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn his lifetime, Leonardo was a cultural export, from Florence under the Medicis to the upstart court of Milan, and a cultural import, from Milan to France. His paintings used to be tools of cultural diplomacy. The Mona Lisa visited the United States in 1963, when France briefly admired America under its young president, John F. Kennedy.\n\nBut Leonardos are likely to travel less in the future, as museums depend on them to validate the touristic-spiritual yearnings of their millions of visitors, and as nations hold them more closely, ossified symbols of national prestige in an age of resurgent nationalism.\n\nSo a Leonardo exhibition without the major paintings is simply a sign of the times. But every exhibition devoted to Leonardo must grapple with the basic question: Why did a man who lived into his late 60s \u2014 a man who was ceaselessly inventive, who left thousands of pages of meticulous drawings and notes, whose personal beauty, intelligence and discourse charmed everyone with what we would now call star power and celebrity \u2014 leave behind so few finished works? Was he undisciplined and distracted, or thwarted by his own perfectionism? Did his ambition entice him to draft the basic lines of paintings he could never realize in paint? Did he intentionally withhold his genius from a public he considered unworthy?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeginning in the 19th century, the most common answer has had to do with his pursuit of science. His interest in painting was only an extension of his deeper interest in the material world. He thought through the visual world by analogy, looking for affinities between the way hair curled and water eddied, between human anatomy and the life of trees and animals, and the structure of the Earth and heavens. But as he became increasingly preoccupied with scientific questions, he got lost in the process of looking into the world.\n\nThe exhibition\u2019s curators, Vincent Delieuvin and Louis Frank, argue with that conclusion. It may seem, says a wall text, that science was \u201can endless, multifaceted labyrinth in which the painter . . . ultimately lost his way.\u201d But, \u201cthis disappearance is illusory.\u201d Rather, it was the process of looking, observing and working out problems in myriad ways (in diagrams on paper, with paint on wood, in his writings and in his head) that mattered to Leonardo. His energies and endeavors were part of one holistic enterprise.\n\nLeonardo\u2019s own writing partially confirms that. He said, \u201cThe divinity which is the science of painting transmutes the painter\u2019s mind into a resemblance of the divine mind.\u201d How do we take that? As a simple indication that, when the painter is painting, his intelligence and creativity somehow mimic what God is said to have done in creating the world? Or that the painter is literally transformed through the process of painting into a state of intellectual ecstasy that approaches the divine? That would certainly explain why he preferred the act of painting to the making of finished paintings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Louvre curators won\u2019t go that far, and for the most part they keep the exhibition closely focused on the visual data, the major preparatory works for the great paintings and supporting evidence for lost works such as the unfinished \u201cBattle of Anghiari\u201d (represented in the show by a vital 16th-century copy displayed next to Aristotile da Sangallo\u2019s essential copy of Michelangelo\u2019s lost \u201cBattle of Cascina\u201d). But one can\u2019t gather this much of Leonardo\u2019s opus without explosive things happening. And the thrilling aftereffect of this show is how closely it entangles even skeptical visitors in the persistent myth of Leonardo\u2019s superhuman intelligence.\n\nI resisted, but I failed. The paintings that didn\u2019t come to Paris are represented with infrared reflectography, and standing before the large monochrome image of his early \u201cAdoration of the Magi,\u201d you see at scale the polyphonic vortex of the unfinished painting, which never translates in small-scale reproduction. I\u2019ve seen the \u201cBenois Madonna\u201d at the Hermitage, but under bad light and with a crowd. Here, one sees that her toothless smile isn\u2019t toothless at all, and her presence is no less powerful than that of her better-known cousin, the Mona Lisa. Small allegorical drawings, about the size of a large egg, contain fully meaningful and realized worlds within them, rather like the little eggs at the feet of \u201cLeda\u201d contain fully realized little human hatchlings (the image was based on Leonardo\u2019s ideas for a painting based on the Greek myth of Leda and the Swan).\n\nI could go on and on, because Leonardo went on and on, and this exhibition manages to reflect that incessant creativity without abbreviation or excess. One last image troubles me. In a room of drawings and notes that includes his exercises in ornithology and architecture and studies for how light glints off the surface of water, is an unprepossessing sketch of a man\u2019s head and eyes, with the proportions carefully annotated with measuring lines.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf you\u2019ve paid attention to one of the most momentous developments in technology today, the ability of machines to learn and analyze the details and deviations of facial physiognomy, you\u2019ve seen these lines, proportions and measures before, and you know the daunting promise and peril of this new science of looking. With this tool, which extends Leonardo\u2019s basic ambition infinitely beyond the scope of what he could have done with the bare eye, we can now diagnose diseases and monitor the behavior of ordinary citizens walking down the street. Its medical potential could liberate us from our bodily feebleness, and its political potential could ultimately subjugate the entire species to dull, dutiful conformity.\n\nLeonardo knew none of these latter-day Frankenstein fears, nor could he imagine outsourcing the work of our eyes to an impenetrably complicated machine. But he almost certainly knew the limits of trying to divine the meaning of things from the surface of their appearance, and through his life\u2019s work and service to potentates, he knew the ultimate marketability of his knowledge. He was born and died in a world around which the sun and planets still revolved in their orderly, medieval fashion. But if we love him for more than a handful of paintings \u2014 which exhibitions like this compel us to do \u2014 it is for having pioneered his way from ignorance to knowledge to enlightened and enervating uncertainty, the fundamental spiritual condition of the postmodern, post-liberal, post-democratic age. He lived with that confusion productively, as we must, too.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci: 1452-1519\u201d is on view at the Louvre in Paris through Feb. 24.
