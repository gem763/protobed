At that Tiffany event, the Aussie singer made a comment about one of the bracelets he was wearing from the collection as he walked the red carpet. \"They gave me this nice sort of simple band right here -- and I'd maybe do this -- you can get it engraved or do something like that,\" he said. \"I'd maybe do something like that for someone. Personalize it a little.\"\n\nView photos Jean Baptiste Lacroix/Getty Images More\n\nThe duo also hasn't shied away from sharing their blossoming love on social media.\n\nCyrus, 26, and Simpson's lovey-dovey behavior came the same weekend the \"Slide Away\" singer's estranged husband, Liam Hemsworth, was spotted packing on the PDA with Dynasty star Maddison Brown in New York City.
