Many are hired by recruitment companies which specialise in Asian labour, whose number has exploded.\n\n\"At first we were solicited for small projects, but for the past three years the demand for workers for large projects has increased significantly,\" Corina Constantin, director of recruiter Multi Professional Solutions, tells AFP.\n\nAccording to a 2018 study by US-based ManpowerGroup, four out of five Romanian employers have difficulties in filling posts.\n\nWith a total workforce of 5.1 million, the country -- one of the poorest in Europe -- lacks an estimated 300,000 workers, according to industry groups.\n\n\"All sectors are affected but things are particularly bad in industries, where there are strict deadlines and contracts to be respected throughout the year,\" Christian Parvan, vice-president of the Association of Entrepreneurs, tells AFP.\n\n- 'Abusive behaviour' -\n\nParvan says foreign workers get \"treated well\", and their employers try to integrate them in the conservative EU member state, which unlike many other European countries has not seen a surge of nationalist sentiment.\n\nBaluta, the Bucharest district mayor, says 500-odd Vietnamese employed in construction in his district receive the equivalent of 900 euros ($1,000) net per month, one third higher than the average salary in Romania.\n\nBut trade unionist Dumitru Costin criticises what he describes as \"abusive behaviour\" by many employers, adding that the Asian workforce \"is much, much cheaper than the local one\".\n\nHe says labour inspectors cannot check whether the \"minimum standards\" of conditions for workers are respected because it is impossible to communicate directly with the employees.\n\n\"When they have travelled thousands of miles to find a job, it is obvious that they will obey without flinching and work unpaid overtime for fear of being sent back to their country,\" says Costin, who heads SNB, one of the country's main trade union confederations.\n\nAcross the border in Hungary, trade unionists make the same accusations.\n\nEmployers \"exploit the language barriers by faking even their working papers\", says Pallagi, the head of the construction workers' union.\n\nZoltan Laszlo, head of the Metallurgical Trade Union, says Hungarian employees likewise are under pressure from their bosses who tell them they are \"easily replaceable\" by Ukrainians, Mongolians or Vietnamese.", "description": "Sporting yellow safety helmets, about 30 men are busy at work on a construction site south of Bucharest, exchanging a few words in Vietnamese.
