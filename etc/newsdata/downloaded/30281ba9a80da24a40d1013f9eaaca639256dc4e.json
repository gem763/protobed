Subscribe to the newsletter here .\n\nIf you missed the first-ever Interface Live last week, I hope you\u2019ll consider come seeing me this week! I\u2019ll be talking with Clara Tsao, a researcher and entrepreneur who focuses on disinformation and platforms, at a free event in San Francisco. It\u2019s on Tuesday at 6:30 p.m., and I would love to see you there. The event is free, and you can RSVP here.\n\nWhen I think about my ideal relationship between Facebook and journalism, something I have been doing more or less since 2016, it has always involved carriage fees: payments from Facebook to publishers to support their journalism, in exchange for the right to run it freely across all of their product surfaces. As I told Columbia Journalism Review this summer:\n\nJust as cable companies pay for access to high-quality channels, so, too, should social networks pay for access to high-quality journalism. It\u2019s a win-win-win: publishers get money for journalism; readers get news they can trust; and Facebook gets a higher-quality news environment that can bolster our democracy while making the whole site more attractive for readers and advertisers.\n\nOn Friday, my dream came true. The company announced Facebook News, an experimental tab in the company\u2019s mobile apps that will carry news from BuzzFeed, the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and others. In exchange, some (but not all) of those publishers will receive direct payments, in some cases for millions of dollars over the multi-year life of the contract.\n\nCrucially, publishers get that revenue without having to do much additional work \u2014 this is payment for work they would be doing already, and can now re-invest in high quality journalism. Compare that to Instant Articles, Facebook\u2019s previous big swing with media companies, which required publishers to rebuild their publishing workflows to create a product that generated less revenue than the one it replaced. (Actually, I\u2019ll just compare it for you: carriage fees are way better!)\n\nMark Zuckerberg marked the announcement of Facebook\u2019s new deal with the media with a fireside chat with the CEO of News Corp. and an op-ed in the New York Times in which he committed to helping build a more sustainable financial future for journalism. \u201cWe know that we need to help build a stable model,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote. \u201cUnlike other things we\u2019ve tried in the past, this is a multiyear commitment that should give publishers the confidence to plan ahead.\u201d\n\nIt says something about current public perception of Facebook, the historical enmity publishers have toward it, and the increasing popularity of Facebook-dunking among journalists on Twitter that this news was all received as basically a bad thing.\n\nThe problem was Breitbart. Here\u2019s Adi Robertson in The Verge:\n\nFacebook News is partnering with a variety of regional newspapers and some major national partners, including USA Today and The Wall Street Journal. But as The New York Times and Nieman Lab report, its \u201ctrusted\u201d sources also include Breitbart, a far-right site whose co-founder Steve Bannon once described it as a platform for the white nationalist \u201calt-right.\u201d Breitbart has been criticized for repeated inaccurate and incendiary reporting, often at the expense of immigrants and people of color. Last year, Wikipedia declared it an unreliable source for citations, alongside the British tabloid Daily Mail and the left-wing site Occupy Democrats. That\u2019s led to questions about why Breitbart belongs on Facebook News, a feature that will supposedly be held to far tougher standards than the normal News Feed. In a question-and-answer session after the interview, Zuckerberg told Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan that Facebook would have \u201cobjective standards\u201d for quality. [...] But when New York Times reporter Marc Tracy asked how including Breitbart served that cause, Zuckerberg emphasized its politics, not its reporting. \u201cPart of having this be a trusted source is that it needs to have a diversity of views in there, so I think you want to have content that represents different perspectives,\u201d he said. Zuckerberg reiterated that these perspectives should comply with Facebook\u2019s standards, and he was cagey about Breitbart\u2019s presence, saying that \u201chaving someone be possible or eligible to show up\u201d doesn\u2019t guarantee frequent placement. \u201cBut I certainly think you want to include a breadth of content in there,\u201d he said.\n\nThe conversation continued into the weekend, with much aggrieved tweeting. Instagram boss Adam Mosseri went so far as to say that he himself didn\u2019t want Breitbart in Facebook News, but argued that Facebook should not exclude publications from the tab for ideological reasons.\n\nIt seems to me that Breitbart was included in the tab precisely for ideological reasons \u2014 for the \u201cbreadth of content\u201d reasons Zuckerberg mentioned. Certainly no one at Facebook seems to be suggesting that Breitbart is a reliable producer of high-quality journalism \u2014 the argument seems to be rather that it would be poor form to exclude them just because they once (for example) tagged relevant stories with the label \u201cblack crime.\u201d Different perspectives and all that.\n\nUltimately, I\u2019m with Mosseri \u2014 Breitbart doesn\u2019t belong in Facebook News. Breitbart should be allowed to have a Facebook page and share links freely in the News Feed, assuming it doesn\u2019t violate the company\u2019s standards. But including the publisher in the News tab elevates its work and supports it financially. It gives the outlet both freedom of speech and freedom of reach, when it only deserves the former.\n\nAs with Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to exempt politicians\u2019 ads from fact-checking, which runs counter to the efforts of its platform integrity team to remove misinformation from Facebook, the decision to bring Breitbart into its stable of trusted news partners would seem to run counter to its efforts to promote a healthy news environment. (Among other things, the site has a dedicated \u201cFake News Freakouts\u201d section that exists primarily to undermine confidence in reported journalism.)\n\nFacebook is now in a position where it fights misinformation with one hand while ushering it onto the platform with another. As Mike Isaac reported in the Times today, that has sparked a debate inside the company, where more than 250 employees have signed a post asking the company to reconsider its policy to exempt politicians\u2019 ads from fact-checking. In the letter, employees worried that the move could:\n\nIncrease distrust in our platform by allowing similar paid and organic content to sit side-by-side \u2014 some with third-party fact-checking and some without. Additionally, it communicates that we are OK profiting from deliberate misinformation campaigns by those in or seeking positions of power.\n\nYou can imagine employees mounting a similar criticism of Breitbart as a news partner \u2014 that it increases distrust in the platform by sitting side by side with traditional publishers. We\u2019ll see.\n\nIn the meantime, we continue to see stunts that put Facebook\u2019s contradictory policies to the test. A political action committee bought an ad falsely stating that Sen. Lindsay Graham supported the Green New Deal (if only); Facebook took it down. And on Monday, a California man filed paperwork for governor with the express intention of using his status as a candidate to run false political ads on Facebook. Donie O\u2019Sullivan reported:\n\nHampton told CNN Business that he will use his new status as a candidate to run false ads on Facebook about President Trump, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and other Facebook executives. He said he also plans to run false ads on Facebook about executives of Twitter, which also has a policy of not fact-checking ads run by candidates. His goal is to force Facebook to stop allowing politicians to run false ads.\n\nWhich argument will ultimately carry the day? Probably the one that helps Facebook grow the most, as Charlie Warzel argued in a deeply necessary piece over the weekend:\n\nBecause Mr. Zuckerberg is one of the most powerful people in politics right now \u2014 and because the stakes feel so high \u2014 there\u2019s a desire to assign him a political label. That\u2019s understandable but largely beside the point. Mark Zuckerberg may very well have political beliefs. And his every action does have political consequences. But he is not a Republican or a Democrat in how he wields his power. Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s only real political affiliation is that he\u2019s the chief executive of Facebook. His only consistent ideology is that connectivity is a universal good. And his only consistent goal is advancing that ideology, at nearly any cost.\n\nCritics who want to see Breitbart gone from the news tab, or lies gone from politicians\u2019 ads, should probably start by making the case that Facebook will grow faster without them.\n\nElsewhere: A history of Facebook\u2019s bad treatment of publishers; a product-focused argument that Facebook News is too little, too late.\n\nThe Ratio\n\nToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.\n\nTrending up Instagram extended its ban on self-harm content to drawings and cartoons. The move came in response to public outcry over the death of teenager Molly Russell, who killed herself after viewing graphic content on the platform.\n\nTrending up: Facebook removed ads from a pro-Trump super PAC that used scare tactics in an effort to obtain voter data. The ads targeted people in Arizona.\n\nTrending sideways: Judd Legum uncovered a network of Facebook pages that exist solely to promote the right-wing site The Daily Caller, sometimes using misleading labels, but Facebook says it doesn\u2019t qualify as \u201ccoordinated inauthentic behavior.\u201d Evelyn Douek says it\u2019s part of a larger legitimacy crisis over the meaning of that term.\n\nTrending down: Facebook\u2019s efforts to remove vaccine-related misinformation have been inconsistent, and in some cases the company has taken down ads for free vaccinations.\n\nTrending down: Facebook also asked a public health organization to register as a political advertiser in order to run a campaign promoting PrEP, a drug that greatly reduces the transmission of HIV.\n\nGoverning\n\n\u2b50 Microsoft won a $10 billion contract from the Department of Defense, beating out Amazon in a months-long battle over who would provide cloud computing services to the military. Kate Conger, David E. Sanger and Scott Shane at The New York Times have the story:\n\nThe 10-year contract for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, known as JEDI, had set off a showdown among Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle and Google for the right to transform the military\u2019s cloud computing systems. The acrimonious process involved intense lobbying efforts and legal challenges among the rivals.\n\nThe fight was closely monitored after Trump ramped up his criticism on Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, apparently telling defense secretary James Mattis to \u201cscrew\u201d the company out of bidding on the contract. (Zachary Cohen and Kevin Bohn / CNN)\n\nRep. David Cicilline (D-RI) is drafting a bill to stop Facebook from profiting off misinformation. The legislation specifically targets the company\u2019s political ad policy, which the congressman called \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d Cicilline is heading up the House antitrust investigation into big tech. (Cat Zakrzewski / The Washington Post)\n\nIn a leaked video, Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the company is struggling with employee trust after hiring Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official who backed the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban. (Greg Bensinger / The Washington Post)\n\nThe congressman who grilled Mark Zuckerberg about vaccines during the Libra hearing is sharing anti-vax conspiracies on Facebook. Bill Posey (R-FL) claimed that he is pro-vaccine, but urged Zuckerberg to allow anti-vaxxers to share their opinions. (Aaron Mak / Slate)\n\nHuman rights attorney Jameel Jaffer argues that Mark Zuckerberg falsely equates speech on Facebook with free speech. \u201cA world in which no one\u2019s voice was silenced but the public square was flooded with hate and disinformation would not represent a triumph of free speech,\u201d he writes. (Jameel Jaffer / Knight First Amendment Institute)\n\nCalifornia Democratic Rep. Katie Hill announced her resignation after nude images were published online without her consent. She is going to fight the nonconsensual sharing of intimate imagery after she leaves Congress. Hill acknowledged having a consensual relationship with a campaign staffer. (Makena Kelly / The Verge)\n\nSeveral Democratic presidential campaigns were targeted by a Russia-based operation on Instagram. They said they were unaware of the disinformation efforts until the tech giant announced them publicly last week. (Isaac Stanley-Becker, Ellen Nakashima and Tony Romm / The Washington Post)\n\nTrump told Apple CEO Tim Cook that he isn\u2019t a fan of the swipe, and wants his iPhone home button back. Apparently the president recently upgraded to a new device. (Jay Peters / The Verge)\n\nThe moderator who leads Reddit\u2019s r/relationships subreddit, a community with 2.6 million members, said she keeps things civil by deleting tons of content. Her rules, which include a ban on gendered language and images of any kind, are much stricter than that of a typical social network. Context is everything in content moderation, and this article illustrates why. (Kaitlyn Tiffany / The Atlantic)\n\nTaiwan has developed a social network to help it find consensus on difficult policy decisions. The platform, vTaiwan, allows experts and other stakeholders to deliberate contentious issues. (Carl Miller / BBC)\n\nIndia is using an opaque legal process to suppress Kashmiri journalists and commentary on Twitter. The company hasn\u2019t complied with every request, but more accounts were withheld in India in the second half of 2018 than in the rest of the world combined. (vi Asher-Schapiro and Ahmed Zidan / Committee to Protect Journalists)\n\nIndustry\n\n\u2b50 Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey criticized Mark Zuckerberg over issues related to free speech and Libra. Sarah Frier and Kurt Wagner at Bloomberg explain:\n\nLike Twitter, Facebook\u2019s algorithm for sorting posts in a person\u2019s social media feed gives heavier weight to those that users share and comment on. Often that means the most incendiary or surprising messages find their way to the biggest audience. Other than addressing his algorithm, Zuckerberg didn\u2019t talk about the difference between content that naturally goes viral and promoted posts that people pay to send to a bigger audience. \u201cIt was a major gap and flaw in the substance he was getting across,\u201d Dorsey said.\n\nAlso: Dorsey said \u201chell no\u201d when asked if Twitter will ever join Libra, at a media event in New York City. He added that Facebook didn\u2019t need to make a cryptocurrency to pull of its goals of democratizing the financial system. (Ashley Carman / The Verge)\n\nFacebook usage dropped 26 percent since 2017, according to new research from Activate Inc. It\u2019s still way ahead of competitors in terms of membership, with more than 2 billion users. The change is partially due to young people moving to Instagram, which Facebook owns. (Mark Sullivan / Fast Company)\n\nFacebook will no longer use the word \u201cundesirable\u201d in the rejection messages it sends to potential advertisers. The company had been using the word when rejecting ads that featured people who were overweight or had skin conditions. (Makena Kelly / The Verge)\n\nFacebook created a machine learning system to make people invisible to facial recognition. The tool works by slightly distorting someone\u2019s face, and was able to fool state-of-the-art facial recognition systems. (Khari Johnson / VentureBeat)\n\nYouTube\u2019s favorite stunt philanthropist, Jimmy \u201cMrBeast\u201d Donaldson, is organizing a fundraising effort with more than 600 YouTubers, including PewDiePie and MKBHD, to plant 20 million trees. The goal is to raise $20 million. (Julia Alexander / The Verge)\n\nFacebook and Instagram banned \u2018horny\u2019 emojis. Users can no longer pair eggplant and peach emojis with sexual statements about being in the mood. This is an issue I am now referring to as \u201cfreedom of peach,\u201d and I hope Congress gets involved. (Mikelle Street / Out)\n\nAnd finally...\n\nPrivacy Scandal: Mark Zuckerberg Is Being Chased By A Shotgun-Toting Farmer After Ignoring The Old Man\u2019s Rule Not To Collect His Beautiful Daughter\u2019s Personal Data.\n\nClickhole made me laugh:\n\nZuckerberg chanced across the farmer\u2019s cottage when his car broke down while he was driving home late one night from Facebook\u2019s headquarters. After knocking on Old Man Clemson\u2019s front door, the aging farmer generously offered him a place to sleep for the night, with one strict stipulation: \u201cMr. Zuckerberg, you\u2019re welcome to my hospitality, but keep your distance from my daughter Gwendoline\u2019s data,\u201d warned the farmer. \u201cYou avoid assembling a user profile about her online browsing habits, and we\u2019ll all get along just fine.\u201d\n\nTalk to us\n\nSend us tips, comments, questions, and your favorite Breitbart stories: casey@theverge.com and zoe@theverge.com.", "description": "Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s explanations for including the right-wing news outlet among its list of trusted publishers risks ruining the goodwill its new news tab could have generated otherwise.
