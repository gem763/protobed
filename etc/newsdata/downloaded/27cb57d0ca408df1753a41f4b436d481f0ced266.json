It is not as bad as you\u2019ve heard. The divorce rate is high, but it still requires a lot of variables for a couple to actually get divorced. Still, \u201cprobably won\u2019t happen\u201d doesn\u2019t mean your marriage is on stable ground. If your marriage does end badly, chances are you\u2019ll need help. That\u2019s where a Certified Divorce Financial Analyst comes in.\n\nDivorce in the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the divorce rate in America is somewhere around 50%. While that\u2019s not great, accurate statistics can both inform and mislead.\n\nYes, half of all marriages end in divorce. But that\u2019s not the same thing as saying half of all people get divorced. In fact, new couples today have closer to a 25% rate of actual divorce.\n\nSeveral factors make a couple more or less likely to separate over time, and overwhelmingly the most important is how often the participants have been married before. The more often you get married, the more likely it is that each new marriage will end in divorce.\n\nWhile the stats are rough, first marriages generally have a divorce rate of 20% to 30%. Second marriages end about 60% of the time. About 75% of people with three or more marriages get divorced. That high divorce rate is driven by people burning through multiple marriages and growing more likely to divorce their next partner with each one.\n\nBut multiple marriages aren\u2019t the only factor. Couples who marry earlier get divorced far more often than those who wait. (Turns out 19 year olds don\u2019t make the best major life choices. Who knew?) Couples with one or more college degree divorce less often than those without. Baby Boomers divorce more often than subsequent generations.\n\nBig picture? The best way to avoid divorce may be to slow down a little bit, start becoming the adult you want to be, then try not to fret about a divorce rate far less scary than it appears.\n\nWhat Is A Certified Divorce Financial Analyst (CDFA)?\n\nWhat does a cdfa do? More\n\nThe CDFA is a credential for financial professionals who help people to plan their divorces. While divorce involves many different areas of life planning, one of the most significant issues that couples navigate is how to split their assets. A certified divorce financial analyst helps with that. Some common issues that a CDFA will help with include:\n\nThe CDFA certification is awarded to financial professionals, including financial planners and counselors. It shows that the holder has studied and shown a special expertise in the financial and accounting issues that frequently occur while negotiating a divorce. This certification does not license or authorize the holder to help couples negotiate their divorces. Any financial professional can perform this service. Instead, the CDFA simply indicates a higher degree or skill and specialty in that field.\n\nIt is also critical to understand that the CDFA is not a law degree or license. It does not authorize the holder to help couples with any of the legal issues that come up during a divorce. This is particularly important because of how often legal and accounting issues overlap during divorce proceedings (such as with child support calculations).\n\nThis certification was formerly known as a Certified Divorce Planner.\n\nHow Do You Become a Certified Divorce Financial Analyst?\n\nThe CDFA credential is issued by the Institute for Divorce Financial Analysts. To receive one, the applicant must meet the following requirements:\n\nA bachelor\u2019s degree or higher.\n\nAt least three years of relevant experience.\n\nComplete and pass the four certification exams.\n\nMaintain 15 hours of continuing education every two years.\n\nMaintain the $295 annual fee.\n\nThe CDFA exams cover the following four subjects:\n\n1. The basic structure of divorce procedure and law, and the role of a CDFA in those proceedings.\n\n2. The financial aspects of divorce, ranging from alimony and real estate to pre-marital assets and retirement accounts.\n\n3. The tax issues raised by divorce.\n\n4. Practical case studies, with a particular emphasis on building settlements and finding errors in example settlements.\n\nThe cost of all four exams and their study materials is $1,530 in the U.S. and $1,150 in Canada. Exam prep materials consist of four modules that require 20 to 25 hours of study apiece.\n\nIf you have to retake an exam, it costs $150 per retake. You can retake the exam as many times as you like, but there is a 30-day waiting period after you fail an exam. You\u2019re only allowed to take an exam three times in any 12-month period.", "description": "Let\u2019s start with some good news. It is not as bad as you\u2019ve heard.
