The project grew out of a need Hale saw in his own life: \u201cIt came from a place of when I was on \u2018Arrested Development,\u2019\u201d Hale told Yahoo Finance\u2019s Jen Rogers for the series My Three Cents. \u201cI was on this great show, great cast, and I was still looking to my next thing. And I was like, \u2018Oh, I'm going to get to the end of my life and just always be looking to the next thing and missing where I am.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo he created Archibald and his tiny pal Bea (who is a bee and \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 knows how to just \u201cbe\u201d). They are a reminder to 48-year-old Hale about the best way to live his own life. \u201cI think my favorite thing out of it is [Archibald] is this skinny chicken who's become my role model,\u201d said Hale. \u201cHe sees the best in everyone, the best in every situation.\u201d\n\n'Archibald's Next Big Thing' from the creative mind of actor Tony Hale, with DreamWorks Animation and Netflix More\n\nHale is the voice of Archibald (literally and figuratively) and an executive producer of the series. As he celebrates the launch of the sweet and frolicking series, Hale is also in the running for his third Emmy Award later this month for his performance in the final season of \u201cVeep.\u201d\n\nHale certainly has come a long way from waiting tables and fronting Pepto-Bismol commercials. \u201cWhat do I think I did right? Honestly, I think I've surrounded myself with a community that sees me and knows me,\u201d he says of his close friends and family. \u201cI think that is very, very important. Any kind of person who is starting in the business...one of the first things I say is, \u2018Please invest in your community before you dive straight into your career because it's going to be the thing that's going to give longevity\u2019\u201d\n\nMy Three Cents with Jen Rogers is a weekly interview series that explores celebrities\u2019 history with \u2014 and relationship to \u2014 money and career.
