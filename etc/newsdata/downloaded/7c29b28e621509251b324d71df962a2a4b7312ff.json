A lot of times it can feel like the world is about to end.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHardcastle and others encountered skepticism and resistance from lawmakers who worried that students would use mental health days as an excuse to skip school or that such a law would coddle young people.\n\nBut mental health problems among youths have been on a steady, alarming rise in recent years. A study this year showed a steeper rise in reports of mental distress, depression and suicidal thoughts among teens and young adults than in people of other ages.\n\nSuicidal thoughts among teens ages 18 or 19 increased 46 percent from 2008 to 2017, and suicide attempts among people ages 22 or 23 have doubled. A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this month showed the rate of suicide increased by 56 percent from 2007 to 2017 among people ages 10 to 24. Suicide in recent years has become the second-most-common cause of death among teens and young adults, overtaking homicides and outpaced only by accidents.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nExperts cannot easily explain the mental illness epidemic among youths. Some have attributed it to lack of community, the rise of social media, bullying or less sleep.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s one single answer,\u201d said Jennifer Rothman from the National Alliance on Mental Illness. \u201cBut we know there\u2019s a real need to do something about it. And these mental sick days are a way to at least end the silence and talk about the problem.\u201d\n\nIn Oregon, the idea for mental sick days came up at a summer camp of student leaders from high schools throughout the state, said Hardcastle and others who attended. Many students talked about suicides by friends and friends of friends. Some talked openly about their own struggles with mental illness.\n\nAD\n\nThe student leaders created a new group \u2014 Students for a Healthy Oregon \u2014 and enlisted the help of psychologists and lobbyists to volunteer as advisers.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe helped them figure out which legislators they needed to get on board and things like how to organize a letter-writing campaign,\u201d said Robin Henderson, a psychologist and chief executive for behavioral health for the Providence Oregon health-care system. \u201cIt was surprising the amount of pushback they got.\u201d\n\nBefore the law, Oregon students could have up to five days of excused absences in a three-month period for physical illness, doctor or dentist appointments or a family emergency. Outside those circumstances, they often would not be allowed to make up tests or homework they missed.\n\nAD\n\nSome lawmakers grilled the students on their proposal. At a legislative hearing in April, state Sen. Mark Hass (D) told the students, \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re dealing with up here is chronic absenteeism . . . that affects graduation rates.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nState Sen. Dallas Heard (R) said he believes students need to toughen up: \u201cIf we simply just start saying . . . that there really is no consequence for ramping up this idea that we should not have to come to work or practice or to school because we\u2019re having a bad day . . . I\u2019m concerned that\u2019s going to continue to start eroding our society to the point where we have much, much bigger issues.\u201d\n\nHeard also worried about the effect on athletes. \u201cIf they\u2019re a starter on the team, should [they] still be able to start even if the rest of the team is not missing practice?\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLife is going to get a lot harder,\u201d Heard told the students.\n\nTrying to answer the lawmakers\u2019 concerns, high school senior Derek Evans responded, \u201cThe bottom line of this is there will be students that will abuse the system but there will be students that this will save.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEvans talked about his struggles with anxiety and depression, and how recently \u2014 after being a longtime 4.0 student \u2014 he had to take four days off for mental health and was sternly warned by administrators that he would fail if he did not return to school immediately.\n\n\u201cThe system appears not to support our students but to force them into classes when they are far from healthy,\u201d Evans said.\n\nAD\n\nAllowing students to take mental sick days could help parents and counselors take notice and spark conversations, other students argued at the hearings.\n\n\u201cOne the biggest problems that persists with mental health is the stigma around it,\u201d Amit Paley, CEO and executive director of the LGBTQ youth suicide prevention group the Trevor Project, said in an interview. \u201cIf a young person can feel comfortable saying I need help, that can be life-changing for a young person. It\u2019s really different than having to lie about what\u2019s going on just to take a sick day.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis summer, after a year of lobbying, letter writing and testifying at their state capitol, the students in Oregon got their bill signed into law and enacted. Since then, they have been advising student leaders in other states interested in getting similar laws passed.\n\nAD\n\nIn Colorado, students are working with local officials to try to introduce a bill when the state legislature reconvenes in January.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about mental health because of the school shootings we\u2019ve had,\u201d said Ethan Reed, a high school junior and a leader in the effort.\n\nPresident Trump and others have blamed mass shootings on mental illness, but studies show other factors are more strongly associated with the attacks, such as a strong sense of resentment and access to guns.\n\nReed and other student advocates, as well as many education officials, have focused on students who have been traumatized by school shootings, including one in June at a Colorado STEM school, and other students who fear that their classrooms could be next. \u201cI know a lot of youth in our community who are still hurting from it,\u201d said Reed, who sits on a state school safety group. \u201cSomething like this would help.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, the high school student leaders in Oregon are trying to pass a second bill this year that would incorporate mental health into physical-health checkups that are already carried out in Oregon schools every year.\n\n\u201cThe whole experience of passing the bill, it\u2019s makes you realize you can change things,\u201d said Hardcastle, now a freshman at the University of Oregon. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have special connections. You just have to speak up and be passionate.\u201d", "description": "Oregon and Utah have passed laws for school sick days to include depression, anxiety and other psychological issues.", "authors": ["William Wan", "National Correspondent Covering Health", "Science"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/exa5-gvsIGm7jEAXKrNvq1Q6qHY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FDK43NXR4EI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
