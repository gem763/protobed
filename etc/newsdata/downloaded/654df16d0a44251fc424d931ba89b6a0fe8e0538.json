Is that unethical to give me, like someone who doesn\u2019t play quarterback, quarterback stats?\u201d\n\nAfter finding high school game tape of an announcer saying that Winovich should take some snaps, he\u2019s now listed in Madden 20 with 51 throw power and 35 short accuracy.\n\nThen there\u2019s Raiders WR Hunter Renfrow, who threw two passes for for two yards in college and punted once for 38.40m. He now, in addition to decent receiving skills, has 44 throw power and 41 short throw accuracy.\n\nNot every weird stat is the result of complaints, though. Freshly un-retired QB Josh McCown has a vertical rating of 90, which seems insane, but also makes sense because EA saw this video of the 40 year-old getting up there playing basketball.\n\nThere\u2019s loads more of these odd little stats over at Banner Society.", "description": "NFL players often complain to EA Sports about their Madden ratings when it comes to attributes like speed, but I had no idea there\u2019s a subset of complaints that come in every year about stuff that most people at home will never actually get to see or use....", "authors": ["Alex Walker", "Gita Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/z8zpqf0jrgyzpw4jc5sd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
