Anecdotal reports inspire study in Toronto", "language": "en", "text": "By CBC Docs\n\nIn 1999, John was pinned down by a car in the auto repair shop where he worked. The injury left him in pain and dependent on prescription opioids for two decades. \u201cNow I\u2019m on Percocet, fentanyl, Remeron, anti-inflammatory [pills], sleeping pills, stomach medication, so you\u2019re taking like 12 pills a night. You\u2019re addicted,\u201d he says.\n\nJohn says he needs these pills just to get through the day. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be high. I want to be able to function. But one day, hopefully, I won\u2019t need fentanyl anymore.\u201d\n\nIn the CBC Docs POV documentary Saving Rabbit, John turns to CBD and THC oil to help curb his opioid addiction.\n\nAfter starting medicinal cannabis, John is down from taking 11 pills each night to two and two halves. \u201cI think marijuana is a far healthier choice, and it seems to work,\u201d he says.\n\nTo find out more about how cannabis may help people with their opioid addictions, we talked to Dr. Hance Clarke, medical director of the pain research unit at Toronto General Hospital.\n\nCannabis legalization may reduce opioid deaths\n\nLegalizing cannabis may have a role to play in decreasing opioid mortality rates. \u201cIt\u2019s an evolving idea that was thrust into the forefront when U.S. states legalized cannabis,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cOpioid mortality dropped in those states.\u201d\n\nOne U.S. study, published this summer in Economic Inquiry, showed that recreational marijuana laws reduced annual opioid mortality between 20 and 35 per cent, particularly in people addicted to synthetic opioids such as fentanyl.\n\nLegalization also seems to have an effect on prescription opioid use. Researchers in the U.S. found that in states where medical marijuana was legalized, Medicare patients filled prescriptions for around 14 per cent fewer daily doses of opioids than patients in other states.\n\nThere is a lot of skepticism in the Canadian medical community about cannabis, including using it as a treatment for pain. According to Clarke, only one per cent of doctors prescribe it, despite Canada\u2019s legalization of medical cannabis in 1999 and the establishment of a commercial medical cannabis industry in 2013.\n\n\u201cWe know that there is something there,\u201d says Clarke, \u201cbut so far, every patient has been trial and error.\u201d Doctors are reluctant to prescribe cannabis without unbiased, peer-reviewed research to support its benefits, he explains.\n\nIs CBD the magic ingredient? More research is needed\n\nClarke says researchers currently aren\u2019t certain which component of cannabis may make it effective in treating pain: THC (the main psychoactive compound found in cannabis), CBD (another compound found in cannabis that does not cause a high) or a combination of both.\n\nWhile CBD impacts the dopamine and serotonin systems in the central nervous system and may have some anti-inflammatory effects, Clarke says, \u201cthe story on CBD is certainly not clear-cut.\u201d\n\nThe pot industry is selling pain patients on the merits of CBD oil without research to back up their claims, he adds. And generally, says Clarke, \u201cpeople probably aren\u2019t taking enough of it to work, so it\u2019s not as effective as it\u2019s claimed to be.\u201d\n\nBut Clarke has seen patients like John, thousands of them, who have been able to reduce their reliance on opioids after trying cannabis. He says it\u2019s worth studying because cannabis has fewer side effects and is, overall, much less addictive than opioids.\n\nStill, doctors need to know how much of what product to give patients to see reliable effects in pain reduction, Clarke notes. In particular, more research is needed on oil products because \u201clots of people smoke cannabis for pain relief, but you\u2019ll never get the medical community to support smoking.\u201d\n\nLarge-scale study planned in Toronto\n\nCanada is currently the only country in the world with a legal framework for both recreational and medicinal cannabis, which allows researchers like Clarke to lead the way in studying cannabis-based medicine safety and educating the public.\n\nNext year, his team at the University Health Network will embark on the first controlled study where doctors will use cannabis to reduce their patient\u2019s dependence on prescription opioids. They\u2019ll separate patients into groups to study the effectiveness of CBD, THC, and CBD and THC, and compare them to a placebo group.\n\nClark notes that it will be the first study that has not been funded by a cannabis producer. In fact, the researchers hope to test out a range of products from several producers. \u201cWe hope, in five or 10 years, to get the information we need in order to standardize treatments so people can get reliable products,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat can patients do in the meantime?
