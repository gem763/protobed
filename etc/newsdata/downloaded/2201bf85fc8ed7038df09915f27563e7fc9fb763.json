I think about getting surgery all the time'", "language": "en", "text": "When Sarah Greene got a call from acclaimed director Lenny Abrahamson asking her to audition for his forthcoming BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney\u2019s wildly successful millennial relationships novel Normal People, she was, initially, peeved. The role was a working class mother to one of the Dublin-based co-protagonists.\n\n\u201cI thought, I\u2019m too young to play Lorraine,\u201d she says, straightening her 5ft 3in frame out from the nook of a London hotel sofa in mock indignation. Greene, who grew up in Cork, and is a stalwart of Irish TV, film and theatre, is 35. \u201cThen I realised Lorraine is 35, too. She just had Connell at 15. So I am the right age,\u201d she sighs.\n\nWhile Greene doesn\u2019t look a day over 28, it\u2019s clear ageing is a preoccupation.\n\nAnd not without cause \u2013 women over the age of 30 tend to get shunned by Hollywood, while their ripening male counterparts continue to reel in career-defining roles well into their 40s and 50s. \u201cI mean, look at Leonardo DiCaprio in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. He looks f------ gorgeous, whereas I\u2019ve currently got every single machine and product working on my face to iron out every single wrinkle,\u201d says Greene. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really tough being a woman. I think about getting work done all the time. Look at Nicole Kidman \u2013 her face is completely done.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, I tell Greene, this could well be considered her breakout year. The actress, who was nominated for a Tony award in 2014 for her Broadway performance in The Cripple of Inishmaan opposite Daniel Radcliffe, and won plaudits for roles in Woyzec and The Ferryman in London in 2017, currently stars in BBC One\u2019s eight-part series Dublin Murders as homicide detective Cassie Maddox. It\u2019s 2006, and alongside her partner Rob (Killian Scott), Cassie is investigating the killing of a 13-year-old ballerina found dead on an ancient stone altar in the woods. Now onto its fourth episode, the series has hooked viewers with its sinewy plot, eerie Irish folklore and richly drawn characters: both Cassie and Rob bear psychological scars from past trauma connected to the case, and both operate under dual identities. To muddy the waters further, Tuesday\u2019s episode introduced a new victim, who, unsettlingly, has the same name as Cassie\u2019s alias. Dublin Murders, along with Normal People, are her biggest TV projects to date. Aged 35, no less. Proof that times are changing?\n\nSarah Greene as Cassie in Dublin Murders Credit: Euston Films/Starz More\n\n\u201cYes, even with The Ferryman, it was unusual to get such a meaty part for a female on stage. We want to hear female stories,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cDublin Murders was written by Sarah Phelps [adapted from Tana French\u2019s bestselling Dublin Murder Squad novels] and the series had all female producers. \u201cAnd Cassie\u2019s on a murder squad as the only woman in the team.\n\n\u201cLikewise, Normal People was the first time I\u2019d ever worked with a female director of photography, and they bring such a different energy on set. They don\u2019t shout, they don\u2019t throw their weight around. They can actually delegate.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of men throwing their weight around \u2026 I say, while Greene purses her lips expectantly. \u201cHarvey Weinstein is a horrible man. He\u2019s a pig,\u201d she interjects, curtly, reluctant to discuss the director. They met at the 2014 Tony Awards where the disgraced producer promised to launch her career in Hollywood.\n\n\u201c\u2018My money\u2019s on you. Ima make you a star,\u2019 \u201d Greene says, imitating Weinstein\u2019s gruff voice. \u201cI told him he lost his money because I didn\u2019t win [the Tony]. Then he emailed me and told me he was coming to see [The Ferryman]. We had dinner afterwards, just the two of us. He said, \u2018I want to put you in my films.\u2019 The next day, I had two scripts in my hand.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "When Sarah Greene got a call from acclaimed director Lenny Abrahamson asking her to audition for his forthcoming BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney\u2019s wildly successful millennial relationships novel Normal People, she was, initially, peeved.
