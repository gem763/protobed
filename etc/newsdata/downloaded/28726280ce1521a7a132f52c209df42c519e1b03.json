The firm stated that third-party marketers may have been able to reach specific Twitter users based on contact details even if the user had specifically requested for their information to not be used in this way.\n\nThe firm said in a statement that it: \u201ccannot say with certainty how many people were impacted\u201d but BBC News believes that it affects users globally. The company is not proactively contacting customers directly to inform them of the breach, which is unusual in this situation. Twitter claims that it addressed the issue \u201cas of September 17th\u201d but did not state when it discovered the issue.\n\nThe firm stated that it was \u201cno longer using phone numbers or email addresses collected for safety or security purposes for advertising.\u201d Twitter, which has its E.U. HQ based in Dublin, Ireland, did not confirm whether or not it had notified the Irish Data Protection Commissioner about the issue but said that it was communicating with regulators \u201cwhere appropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen an advertiser uploaded their marketing list, we may have matched people on Twitter to their list based on the email or phone number the Twitter account holder provided for safety and security purposes,\u201d the company explained. \u201cThis was an error and we apologize.\u201d\n\nWe recently found that some email addresses and phone numbers provided for account security may have been used unintentionally for advertising purposes. This is no longer happening and we wanted to give you more clarity around the situation: https://t.co/bBLQHwDHeQ \u2014 Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) October 8, 2019\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
