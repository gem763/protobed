I also love stressing myself the hell out over it. I find the question that they often pose \u2014 How would you like to play this game? \u2014 fundamentally ridiculous. Man, I don\u2019t know! I\u2019ve never played this game before! I truly don\u2019t get how anyone is supposed to have their general approach to a game more or less figured out before they even get a taste of it, but that\u2019s how games work. I suppose they work pretty well, given that I usually just go with what sounds cool and it ends up being OK.\n\nHowever, there are still so many points I get hung up on well before I can even start the game. What fantasy species I want to be, what character class, what subclass, the skills I want to be good at \u2014 I hate committing to all of these things and planning out a set of character choices that complement each other. At the same time, part of me loves it \u2014 building a character that\u2019s unique to your sensibilities is one of video games\u2019 biggest pleasures.\n\nA couple days ago, I came up with a compromise entirely by accident. I had downloaded the PlayStation 4 version of Baldur\u2019s Gate II and wanted to just get right to the action so I could see how well it controlled on a console. So I blew through the elaborate, Dungeons & Dragons-style character creation in that game with a series of snap judgments, taking no more than five minutes to decide my fantasy race, class, subclass, name \u2014 everything.\n\nThe character I rolled, Dauphine the Half-Elf Dragon Disciple \u2014 isn\u2019t one I likely would\u2019ve put together had I thought more about it. She\u2019s got a Chaotic Evil alignment, something I tend to avoid. I have no idea what dragon disciples do \u2014 normally I\u2019d look over every class ability. Her spells are a loose assortment of interesting-sounding things I have no idea will prove useful. And I can\u2019t wait to play as her.\n\nThe trick here, I think, is not getting too much into your own head. You know what you like and what you\u2019re interested in doing, so you should trust yourself and get out of your gut\u2019s way. It\u2019s often said that people don\u2019t really know what they want \u2014 we gravitate toward the familiar more than anything else, which is why it\u2019s easy to get excited for a new Star Wars movie you\u2019ll like just fine even though there are loads of potential new favourites just sitting right there on Netflix, unwatched.\n\nTaking risks can be scary \u2014 games require so much investment, and it would be awful if a choice you made ruined the experience. But risks can make things exciting in a way you\u2019d miss if you just went with your usual.\n\nGive it a shot. Next time you boot up a new game that gives you the option, spend five minutes tops creating a character. Surprise yourself a little \u2014 it might change your experience for the better.", "description": "I love creating a character whenever I start a new role-playing game.
