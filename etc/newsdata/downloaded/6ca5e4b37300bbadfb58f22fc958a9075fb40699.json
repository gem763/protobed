And look, Russia presents a great danger to the United States and [that is] something we keep an eye on every single day.\u201d\n\nIn a Sunday morning address, the president announced that ISIS leader al-Baghdadi died in a raid by American troops in northwest Syria the previous night.\n\nBefore thanking \u201cthe great intelligence professionals who helped make this very successful journey possible\u201d and the soldiers and sailors, airmen and Marines involved in the operation, Trump expressed gratitude to Russia for its part in the operation.\n\n\u201cThis raid was impeccable and could only have taken place with the acknowledgment and help of certain other nations and people,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI want to thank the nations of Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq, and I also want to thank the Syrian Kurds for certain support they were able to give us. This was a very, very dangerous mission.\u201d\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin meets with President Trump during the G-20 summit in Osaka in June.

Russian, Turkish and Syrian forces patrol the ground and airspace in the region, and their cooperation was necessary in not attacking the American aircraft involved in the raid.\n\nTrump has received sharp criticism that his decision earlier this month to pull troops out of northern Syria allows Russia to fill the void and allowed Turkey to push out Kurdish militias that have been fighting ISIS alongside American troops. Turkish troops and allied militias entered Northern Syria days after the U.S. withdrawal. Since then, both the U.S. and Russia have brokered ceasefires, with erratic results.\n\nTodd asked Trump\u2019s new national security adviser if Russia is an ally to the United States in this fight with ISIS while simultaneously being an adversary when it comes to Ukraine, which it has invaded. The U.S. is supporting Ukraine in the ongoing war.\n\n\"Let me make it very clear. Russia is not an ally of the United States,\" O\u2019Brien said.\n\n\u201cFirst country he thanked today,\u201d Todd interjected.\n\n\u201cThere are times when our interest overlaps with the interests of Russia,\u201d O\u2019Brien responded. \u201cLast night it overlapped. We didn\u2019t want Russian air defense missiles being shot at our men and women who were executing this raid ... and they don\u2019t like ISIS.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien went on to say, \u201cThe Kurds played an important role in the operation, and we\u2019re grateful for the Kurds and the [Syrian Democratic Forces] and our allies there.\u201d\n\nTrump, who O\u2019Brien lauded for his \u201ccourageous decision\u201d to greenlight the mission, said he did not regret the decision to withdraw from northern Syria.\n\nWhen speaking with reporters about his announcement, Trump was asked if the pullout of U.S. troops was connected to the raid. He said the intelligence locating al-Baghdadi in the region was coincidental to the withdrawal he ordered on Oct. 7.\n\n\u201cThe pullout had nothing to do with this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to keep soldiers between Syria and Turkey for the next 200 years,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cWe\u2019re out. But we are leaving soldiers to keep the oil. And we may have to fight for the oil.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to be home; I want our soldiers home,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you who loves us being there: Russia and China. Because while they build their military we\u2019re depleting our military there. So Russia loves us being there. Now Russia likes us being there for two reasons because we kill ISIS, we kill terrorists and they are very close to Russia.\u201d", "description": "National security adviser Robert O'Brien clarified Sunday that despite Russian cooperation with a U.S. mission that left Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi dead, the country \u201c\u2018is not an ally of the United States.\u201d", "authors": ["Kadia Tubman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7HyMzO0TH_p3FHLSjxMOQg--~B/aD0zMDAwO3c9NDUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/ede8eb80-f8d8-11e9-b667-9eb45584a18e", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
