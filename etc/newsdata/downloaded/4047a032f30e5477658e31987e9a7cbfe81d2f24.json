The legal limit is 35mg of alcohol.\n\nIt is understood the Rev first claimed he\u2019d had a drink after he got back to his place in Newport Pagnell, Bucks \u2013 but officers found alcohol listed on his restaurant bill.\n\nThe Rector of Newport Pagnell with Lathbury & Moulsoe pleaded guilty at High Wycombe Magistrates' Court and was last week handed a \u00a31,605 fine along with the driving ban.\n\n(Image: Stan Kujawa)\n\nBut he may now get the good book thrown at him by his church.\n\nA spokesman for his diocese said: \u201cThe news of Rev Evans\u2019 conviction is an extremely serious matter.\n\n\u201cOur clergy are called to an exemplary standard of moral behaviour.\n\n\u201cThere can be no separation between the public and home life of ministers and there can be no excuse for his actions.\n\n\u201cDrink-driving knowingly puts others at risk and it will not be tolerated by the Diocese of Oxford under any circumstances.\n\n\u201cThe diocese is investigating the matter under its own disciplinary framework.\u201d\n\nFour-times married Rev Evans has apologised.\n\nHe told the Sunday Mirror: \u201cIt is true I was recently convicted of driving over the legal limit for alcohol.\n\n\"I acknowledge my lack of judgement and failure regarding this since church leaders should strive to set an example at all times.\n\n\u201cI am deeply sorry for what has happened.\u201d\n\nBut this is not the first time Rev Evans has found himself in an almighty row.\n\n(Image: Stan Kujawa)\n\nThe Oxford Diocese told the Sunday Mirror a church disciplinary measure was brought against him last year amid claims about his behaviour but the investigation \u201cfailed narrowly\u201d to remove the rector from his post.\n\nRev Evans will no doubt be praying for forgiveness \u2013 which is a subject close to his heart.\n\nLast year he launched a scheme to help former convicts back into work.\n\nAnd he has previously told parishioners he is \u201chopeless\u201d at keeping New Year resolutions.\n\nWriting in 2016, he said: \u201cWe all break the rules from time to time, but God\u2019s love for you is a constant given.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Reverend Nick Evans, Rector of Newport Pagnell, drove home from a restaurant at more than twice the legal limit", "authors": ["Alan Selby", "Image", "Stan Kujawa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728897.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_69.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
