This isn\u2019t some trivial administrative breach. This is a deliberate defiance of the will of parliament and the will of the court. If he is in breach of the law, there will be very serious consequences for him personally.\u201d\n\nMaugham, Vince and Cherry included a proposal to the court last week that Johnson could be jailed or fined for breaching the act. That was not formally proposed in the court hearing last Friday before Lord Pentland, but remains part of their legal submissions.\n\nIt became clear on Wednesday that Johnson\u2019s hopes of securing a last-minute deal with the EU were doomed after the collapse of talks with the German government and disclosure from the Irish government that there was no prospect of a deal before 31 October.\n\nJohnson has asked for a rare Saturday sitting of the Commons on 19 October for emergency debates and votes.\n\nIn a highly unusual but significant ruling, Carloway, sitting with Lord Drummond Young and Lord Brodie, said the court needed to wait to see what happened next week before deciding whether it had to enforce the Benn act.\n\n\u201cThe political debate requires to be played out in the appropriate forum,\u201d the judges ruled. \u201cThe court may only interfere in that debate if there is demonstrable unlawfulness which it requires to address and to correct. At present, there has been no such unlawfulness.\u201d\n\nThe three judges agreed with Pentland, who ruled on Monday that there was no proof Johnson was actively taking steps to undermine the Benn act and the government was entitled to have political arguments about its Brexit strategies.\n\nCarloway said the situation was very fluid and if Johnson did try to thwart or sidestep the act, this would become clearer after midnight on 19 October. If he breaks his promises to the court, it could issue an interdict, or injunction, ordering Johnson to send the extension request, or it could do so, using unique powers open to Scottish judges known as nobile officium (noble office).\n\nThat empowers a court to take action on a legal matter where the responsible person fails to do so, or in order to remedy a deficiency. It would be unprecedented but in that situation, the court would write, sign and send the letter specified in the legislation to Brussels and the other 27 EU member states.\n\nThe judges also hinted strongly in their ruling that they could find Johnson in contempt of court, without a specific application by Dale, Maugham and Cherry, if the prime minister failed to honour the promises government lawyers had made to the court.\n\nThe government had refused to give the court sworn undertakings, a legally binding pledge that Johnson would do as he had promised, but Carloway implied the \u201cdetailed and specific averments\u201d made by its lawyers were enough. Therefore, coercive orders, such as interdicts or nobile officium rulings, were not needed at this stage.\n\nCherry said Johnson and his aides had to understand the significance of the court suspending judgment. It \u201csurely showed there is some doubt lodged in their minds that the promises made to the court will be adhered to\u201d, she said.", "description": "Remain supporters plan civil action against Boris Johnson if he reneges on Brexit pledge", "authors": ["Severin Carrell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c06e51eeb1b84dc8f140bd3c581991325a7ecd4/0_13_4392_2635/master/4392.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=11060ce165adfc07ba60e814d9534410", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
