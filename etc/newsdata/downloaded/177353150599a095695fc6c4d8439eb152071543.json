Mr. Johnson also met with the Iranian and U.S. leaders.\n\nThe goal was to bring about a multilateral meeting that would likely have included the U.S. and Iranian presidents as well as Mr. Macron and possibly other European leaders. That would have required that the U.S. and Iran resolve or set aside any preconditions for a meeting.\n\n\u201cI think I agree with Emmanuel. You need to be on the side of the swimming pool and jump at the same time,\u201d Mr. Johnson said during a huddle Tuesday with Mr. Macron and Mr. Rouhani.\n\nBut Iran wouldn\u2019t budge on its insistence that the U.S. first ease sanctions and the Americans didn\u2019t meet the Iranian demands.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. Iranian officials didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment about the European initiative.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Tuesday evening, Mr. Macron insisted that his efforts weren\u2019t wasted and that the conditions are now in place \u201cfor a quick resumption of dialogue and negotiations\u201d between the U.S. and Iran.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now for Iran and the U.S. to seize these conditions and to meet together again to re-create some momentum,\u201d he said. \u201cFrance is ready\u201d to assist.\n\nDespite the talk of progress, differences remain. European nations are still committed to preserving the 2015 nuclear accord even as they are trying to usher in talks about a broader diplomatic arrangement that might supersede it.\n\nNor have the Europeans endorsed all of the U.S. demands or its readiness to step up sanctions.\n\nAnd while the Europeans were trying to play matchmaker between the U.S. and the Iranians, other diplomatic meetings were taking place.\n\nOn Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo huddled in New York with counterparts from the Gulf Cooperation Council, a group of Arab states including Saudi Arabia.\n\nAdel al-Jubeir, the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs, said on Tuesday that the statement by France, Britain and Germany calling for a more comprehensive approach on the Iran issue was \u201ca significant step forward.\u201d\n\nBut he indicated during an appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations that Saudi Arabia still had concerns about how firm the Europeans were prepared to be with Iran\u2014what he called the methodology of European policy.\n\nHe said Mr. Macron\u2019s proposal to grant Iran modest sanctions relief had emboldened Iran, as had the Europeans\u2019 reluctance to blame Iran for the May attack on a Saudi oil pipeline. Saudi Arabia, he added, was still weighing its diplomatic, military and economic options.\n\nTuesday\u2019s diplomatic push came after the U.K., France and Germany on Monday publicly blamed Iran for last week\u2019s attacks on Saudi oil facilities\n\nIranian officials reacted angrily to the European statement, criticizing the three countries for backing the U.S. charge that Iran was responsible for the Saudi attacks and saying Europe shouldn\u2019t be making demands that are inconsistent with the nuclear deal.\n\nIn a speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Macron said the U.S. strategy of economic pressure had produced an Iranian response of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d against Tehran\u2019s neighbors, which has created the risk of a serious conflict.\n\nHe set out five issues on which negotiations should focus: certainty that Iran never acquires nuclear weapons, a solution to the Yemen crisis, a regional security plan that addresses other conflicts, the security of maritime navigation and the lifting of economic sanctions on Iran.\n\n\u201cI am not naive at all and I don\u2019t believe in miracles,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that it takes courage to build peace.\u201d\n\nMr. Rouhani told reporters in New York on Tuesday that Iran could only accept some small amendments to the 2015 accord. That appeared to be a reference to an Iranian offer to quickly ratify an international protocol allowing the U.N.\u2019s atomic agency to conduct broader inspections in member states. Iran has already provisionally applied this so-called additional protocol, so it would have no practical impact on where inspectors could go.\n\nWrite to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com and Michael R.
