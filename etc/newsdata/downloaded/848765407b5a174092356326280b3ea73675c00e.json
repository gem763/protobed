The new deal, which also covers Facebook\u2019s Messenger platform, would mean that any individuals suspected of serious offences like paedophilia or terrorism would be subject to police warrants for their private messages.\n\nFacebook-owned WhatsApp introduced end-to-end encryption to \u201cevery form of communication\u201d on the app in 2016 in order to prevent messages and images from being seen by anyone other than the person sending and the person receiving them.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.
