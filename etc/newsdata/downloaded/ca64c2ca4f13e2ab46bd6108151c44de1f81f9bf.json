Anyone who registers may withdraw their consent at any time, Jackson said.\n\nA host of other New Jersey communities have similar voluntary security camera registries, including Bridgewater, East Brunswick and South Plainfield.\n\nFor additional information about the program, contact Jackson at 732-248-6462 or kjackson@edisonpd.org.\n\nStaff Writer Susan Loyer: 732-565=7243; sloyer@gannettnj.com\n\nNearing your monthly article limit?\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe | iPhone app | Android app Download the MyCentralJersey.com app for 7 free articles a month, or subscribe today for unlimited digital access to all our content.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/crime/2019/02/27/edison-police-department-asks-residents-business-register-private-surveillance-cameras/2992466002/", "description": "The \u201cCommunity Crime Cam Program\u201d is voluntary,\u00a0engaging residents and businesses as \u201ccrime-fighting partners\u201d to help police solve crimes in neighborhoods and business areas, Police Chief Thomas Bryan said in a news release.", "authors": ["Susan Loyer", "Published A.M.
