I mention partial because the and were in the losing group of currencies on Monday, which you wouldn't expect if a truce is being priced in.\n\nBottom line, I think the movements in the Oceanic currencies are a better reflection of the dicey environment. The , the , the and the were all, in a larger or lesser extent, the beneficiaries of Monday's flows, while the is once again under tepid pressure as UK PM Johnson gets a devastating rejection of its Irish plan.\n\nThe indices show the performance of a particular currency vs G8 FX. An educational video on how to interpret these indices can be found in the Global Prime's Research section.\n\nNarratives In Financial Markets\n\n* The Information is gathered after scanning top publications including the FT, WSJ, Reuters, Bloomberg, ForexLive, Institutional Bank Research reports.\n\nChina aims for only a partial deal: China, via the Commerce Ministry, confirmed earlier reports that it only aims to reach a partial trade deal as part of the trade talks this week (Thursday, Friday), without including in the negotiations reforms on industrial policies or government subsidies.\n\nSticking points won't be negotiated: According to Fox News, China is prepared to set out a timetable for the harder issues to be worked out next year. Fox Business' Edward Lawrence, citing China's commerce ministry, wrote: \u201cThe Chinese Commerce Ministry says what is not in the table and never will be is changes to their laws to protect intellectual property. The Commerce Ministry telling us that the Chinese will deal with intellectual property theft through administrative regulations.\u201d\n\nChina takes advantage of Trump's debilitated position: The fact that Trump is in need to score a big political win amid the scandal of corruption in his Ukraine call from last month, which was partly intended to influence in the meddling of Democrat candidate Joe Biden\u2019s affairs has given China leverage. Whether or not the US blinks by being more flexible in agreeing to a mini deal remains to be seen. Note, Trump has reiterated that either they make a comprehensive full deal or no deal.\n\nKey topics of trade discussion shared by the WH: The White House has published a memo outlining the topics of discussions that will take place as part of this week\u2019s US-China trade talks, scheduled for at least two days. The statement notes the following six topics of discussion: Forced technology transfer, Intellectual property rights, Services, Non-tariff barriers, Agriculture, Enforcement.\n\nTime to re-calibrate over-optimistic expectations: The best one can hope for in this week\u2019s US-China trade talks may be yet another truce in which Trump may agree to extend the deadline for the next increase in tariffs scheduled for October 15, when $250bn worth of Chinese imports will be assigned 30% tariffs from 25%.\n\nUK PM's Irish backstop proposal rejected by the EU: The UK Guardian, in a leaked document, it has learnt the European Union\u2019s full devastating point-by-point rejection of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit proposals for the Irish border. As the paper reports, \u201cthe disclosure follows the prime minister\u2019s claim on Monday that he had not yet heard the EU\u2019s thoughts on the legal text tabled by Downing Street\u2026\u201d\n\nTrump ramps up rhetoric against Turkey: Trump warns he will obliterate Turkey in a controversial tweet, which has led to selling pressure in the , as he considering a withdrawal of the American forces from Syria, immediately condemned among congressional Republicans and protested by America\u2019s allies.\n\nTrump said it was \u201ctime for us to get out\u201d and let others \u201cfigure the situation out.\u201d Trump added that \u201cif Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I've done before!). They must, with Europe and others, watch over...the captured ISIS fighters and families\u2026\u201d\n\nRecent Economic Indicators & Events Ahead\n\nOut of all the events scheduled for today, pay special attention to Fed Chair Powell, due to speak at 5.30am AEDT, at the US National Association of Business Economists, in a speech titled \u201cA view from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors\u201d which will include Q&A. The market will be interested to grab new clues on Powell\u2019s evaluation of the economy after last week\u2019s ISM misses, both the manuf and non-manuf PMIs, alongside a rather mixed payrolls report on Friday. Currently, the market is pricing a Fed rate cut in October at 73% at the close of NY on Monday.\n\nSource: Forexfactory\n\nA Dive Into The FX Indices Charts\n\nThe indices show the performance of a particular currency vs G8 FX. An educational video on how to interpret these indices can be found in the Global Prime's Research section.\n\nThe EUR index has created a higher high in the hourly chart after heavy buy-side pressure came through the early European session, leading to a retest of the prior swing high. encountered resistance, which marked Monday\u2019s high, was a challenging level to break as it perfectly aligned with a 100% proj target, hence why offers eventually managed to pull the price away. There are three well-defined areas to expect the clearest imbalances of demand/supply in the Euro this Tuesday, al compressed within a narrow 0.3% range. The delimitation of the current range include the latest resistance found, a new hourly support after it achieved a successful rotation, with the midpoint of the range, represented via the 50% fib retrac, another proven reactionary level where residual demand is seen in the Euro.\n\nThe GBP index has gone through a rather uneventful technical day, with the undefined outlook extending into Tuesday as part of a broader range context with over 1% of room for the price action to fluctuate before encountering macro bids and offers. The levels that continues to offer the best risk reward remains a tested level of daily support near-by, while the topside sees the mid point of the range as the area where sellers have set its new stronghold, as depicted by the amount of time the price action has been finding equilibrium below this mid point as opposed to the ephemeral time that GBP buyers managed to stay above the red rectangle midpoint. Overall, sellers appear to be gaining ground and conviction in the context of a huge demand imbalance on the daily that keeps being tested, with each test a greater chance of eventually breaking.\n\nThe USD index has so far respected an area of daily demand imbalance from where a new buy-side campaign has been initiated, paying dividends for intraday buyers as manifested by the first successful hourly rotation breaking into a short-term buy-side structure. Notice, in line with the principles of market structure I regularly outline, the reversal of the selling bias came at the 100% proj target. Fast forward, the real test for the USD traders\u2019 interest will come on a test of overhead resistance, which is expected to see an imbalance of supply on a first touch, as it represents the 50% fibonacci retracement from last week\u2019s decline. The context under which the USD trades, above the baseline, makes the short bias a risky one to support, especially on the basis that the level is only visibly identifiable through the hourly chart as the color indicates.\n\nThe CAD index has breached its previous swing high, allowing the structure to now shift to a buy-side bias in the hourly chart as higher highs get printed on the back of a double bottom. The pricing of the CAD remains below the 13-day ema but there is room to witness further upside appreciation until the next supply imbalance detected in the hourly chart (about 0.2%). Any setback in the valuation of the CAD should seen, given the successful rotation, strong demand re-emerging off the recent lows, which is why I\u2019ve highlighted the area as a new-found level of demand imbalance to be expected off the 8h chart, which adds weight. If we see a larger upside extension before a retest of the breakout point, this may act as a significant level of support of the hourly on a backside retest. We could anticipate to see the price test the 13-d ema, be rejected, find further buyers on that backside retest, and then resume the uptrend.\n\nThe NZD index is trapped between hourly levels of support and resistance, both tested and rejected on the first pass, which make the areas no longer as relevant to use as reactionary levels since it won\u2019t be a fresh test. Patience for fresh new levels to be generated is required, unless the NZD can recover all the way up to test an untested area of supply imbalance on the hourly, which would still hold sufficient credence to expect a reaction off it. The drawing of the fibonacci retracement (0,50,100) helps us to really step out and identify the 3 key levels in this market as the current structure stands. What we\u2019ve seen in the last 24h is the NZD buyers stepping in at the 50% retracement of its larger range (micro 100% proj target), only to see sellers popping up at the retest of the breakout point post a successful rotation in the hourly.\n\nThe AUD index is within a short distance of testing what I\u2019d expect to be a demand imbalance level from where buyers will step in as part of the hourly time frame. Note, the index is still trading with an overall bearish bias if one steps out of the lower time frames, with the test of the hourly demand, if/when it happens, to occur below the baseline, which makes it an inherently riskier trade to take if one expect to see a long-lasting buy-side campaign to unfold. To the upside, there is no new clear areas formed at this point until up in the topside extremes, where an untested 8h and daily supply area overlaps within a short distance from each other, where I\u2019d be expecting sellers to return to the market for a fresh sell-side campaign.\n\nThe JPY index sold off away from a tested supply imbalance, which nonetheless held enough credence as to expect further selling interest judging by the renewed sell-side pressure on the back of the US NFP report last Friday. One could have also spotted how the red overlapping line in the chart, which refers to the \u2018risk line\u2019 (sp500 + us30y) was rolling over at the time of the last test. The next logical area of support was tested late in the American session, from where a rebound has taken place. Given the impulsivity of the decline and the fact that the level is no longer a fresh one, those looking to engage in buy-side opportunities in the JPY will be better off patiently waiting until a test of a fresh daily support, which comes about 0.2% below the mentioned hourly level. Coincidentally, which strengthens the technical buy-side case, the 13-day ema is interesting around the same vicinity. A pristine area to engage in JPY longs.\n\nThe CHF index has printed new highs, leading to potentially two new hourly demand imbalances to take into account for those interested to engage in buy-side business as value areas. The structure out of the hourly has now clearly turned bullish, with the price a hair above the 13-day ema, in what still appears to be an unfinished upcycle. The room to see further appreciation in the Swissy is definitely available, with a significant vacuum area that poses little upside obstacles until a fresh level of daily supply gets tested, allowing over 0.4% of leeway. Should the newly found hourly levels be broken, any retest of the bottom side of the macro range should see buying interest re-emerge given what\u2019s so far been achieved (break of structure).\n\nImportant Footnotes", "description": "Forex Analysis by Ivan Delgado covering: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CHF, AUD/USD.
