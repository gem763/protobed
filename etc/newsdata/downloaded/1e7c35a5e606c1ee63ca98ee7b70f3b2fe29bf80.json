But there are many ways you and your fellow passengers can make flights less miserable. Specifically, there are certain things you can avoid doing in order to foster a more pleasant journey for all.\n\nTo guide travelers toward this goal, HuffPost asked some etiquette experts to identify the faux pas they often witness people committing while flying, and their advice on how to avoid repeating them. The answers mostly come down to having respect for others and setting a good example.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re trapped in a small space, you have to have extra good manners. I can\u2019t get off and move away from you on an airplane the way I can in a subway car,\u201d said Jodi R.R. Smith, president of Mannersmith Etiquette Consulting.\n\n\u201cThe kinder you can be, the better you can help to create an atmosphere where we\u2019re all a little bit caring. We all need to get to the destination as quickly and safely as possible, and a little bit of kindness and understanding can go a long way,\u201d Smith added.\n\nWithout further ado, here are 15 of the rudest things you can do on a plane.\n\nBring Pungent Food On Board\n\nIf you want to bring a snack or meal on board, avoid messy or smelly foods. When you\u2019re in a small space, pungent odors will spread, and it\u2019s particularly rude to passengers sitting next to you.\n\n\u201cA tuna sandwich or hard-boiled eggs are better served in a home or restaurant, where there is more air and better air filters,\u201d said Diane Gottsman, national etiquette expert, author of \u201cModern Etiquette for a Better Life,\u201d and founder of The Protocol School of Texas.\n\nBeyond food smells, Smith advised being mindful of your body odor.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019ve just run the New York City marathon, I\u2019m going to take a shower or at least try to give myself a bit of a sponge bath in the airport bathroom before I sit down next to you for a cross-country flight,\u201d Smith said.\n\nWitthaya Prasongsin via Getty Images There are ways to make flights more pleasant for yourself, your fellow passengers and the cabin crew.\n\nTake Photos Of Fellow Passengers\n\nGottsman cautioned against taking pictures of other travelers and posting them online without permission.\n\n\u201cUnless there is a situation which involves potential danger, it\u2019s rude to post a picture of a fellow traveler to make fun of them for something they wearing, carrying or enjoying,\u201d Gottsman said.\n\nMake Lots Of Noise\n\nAll the experts agreed that yelling, having loud conversations and watching a movie on your iPad without earbuds are major no-nos during air travel.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t play a video game with the noise all the up so that everyone is subjected to listen to it,\u201d Smith noted.\n\nUse The Plane As A Spa\n\n\u201cPeople file their nails, floss their teeth, take off their shoes and wiggle their toes. We have to remember the airplane is a means of commuting \u2015 it\u2019s not a day spa,\u201d said Patricia Rossi, a civility expert, keynote speaker and author of \u201cEveryday Etiquette.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you should head to the airplane lavatory for your beauty treatments, either.\n\n\u201cThere are too many passengers waiting to use the facilities for one person to take 20 minutes putting on makeup and fixing their hair. It\u2019s not a beauty salon,\u201d said Gottsman.\n\nIgnore Armrest Protocol\n\nTraditionally, the rule for armrests is that the person on the aisle gets the aisle armrest, the one by the window gets the window armrest, and the person stuck in the middle gets both of the shared middle armrests.\n\nGottsman said the person in the middle seat should be mindful of their neighbors, however. \u201cThe person in the aisle seat may also need to rest their arm on the shared armrest since the one on the aisle can make contact with people walking by to the restroom or a flight attendant who is serving beverages,\u201d she noted, adding that it may be necessary to take turns.\n\nIf you\u2019re sitting in a row with two or four seats, it\u2019s similarly important to be respectful and take turns with the shared armrests.\n\nDisregard Personal Space\n\n\u201cOn airplanes, they\u2019re making our little bubbles smaller and smaller and smaller,\u201d said Smith. \u201dSome people try to shove their legs in between the two sets in front of them. That\u2019s not part of your bubble. Your feet should not be touching somebody else\u2019s arm. Be cognizant of being respectful of other people\u2019s space.\u201d\n\nRespecting people\u2019s personal space extends to germs as well. Gottsman believes passengers should be mindful of their coughing and sneezing, and avoid brushing their hair.\n\n\u201cGerms spread in seconds,\u201d Gottsman said. Hair may not carry as many germs, but people don\u2019t want someone else\u2019s hair wafting onto their clothes or in their personal space.\n\nizusek via Getty Images It's important to respect personal boundaries on flights.\n\nAct Entitled With Flight Attendants\n\nFlight attendants often bear the brunt of passenger rudeness.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of entitlement,\u201d said Jacqueline Whitmore, an international etiquette expert and former flight attendant. \u201cFlight attendants are really there for your safety, but people don\u2019t understand that and think they\u2019re just there to serve you drinks.\u201d\n\nSmith emphasized that flight attendants are more likely to want to help you with matters outside their general duties if you ask politely and wait until you\u2019re at cruising altitude.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t scream at them. Don\u2019t treat them like your servant,\u201d Smith said. \u201cUnless you\u2019re flying first class, don\u2019t expect a cocktail when you sit down. When they\u2019re boarding the plane, their job is to help people board as quickly and safely as possible \u2015 not to get you a drink, bring you extra tissues or find you a pillow.\u201d\n\nRossi recommended showing gratitude to flight attendants. \u201cIf you\u2019re flying around the holidays, get them a $5 or $10 Starbucks card and thank them for working on the holidays to get you where you need to go,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind, and it makes you feel good to do that.\u201d\n\nGlare At Parents Of Crying Babies\n\n\u201cI want people to be forgiving when they\u2019re on an airplane. If an infant is screaming their head off two rows back, there\u2019s not a whole lot a parent can do other than try to calm them,\u201d Smith noted. \u201cThe parent is already exhausted and mortified. You shooting evil glances at that parent is not going to help that situation.\u201d\n\nInstead of glaring, you could see if there\u2019s something you can do to help the situation. Smith outlined a few ways to lend a hand.\n\n\u201cIf you think you\u2019re a baby whisperer, you can offer to hold the baby, burp the baby, rock the baby. You can be helpful in other ways. If you\u2019re in a row with a parent who has a baby and toddler, offer to read the toddler a book or color something in their coloring book so that the parent can take care of the infant,\u201d she suggested.\n\n\u201cWe have to consider ourselves part of a giant human family and when you can help, you should help,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a jungle gym for a toddler that won\u2019t sit still, though.\u201d\n\nLet Your Children Run Wild\n\nWhile many things are out of parents\u2019 control, they can make an effort to calm their energetic children.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen kids are jumping on the seats, moving the seats in front of them, playing drums on the tray table, being too noisy and rambunctious, or running up and down the aisles and getting in the way of the flight attendant\u2019s meal cart,\u201d said Whitmore, adding that it\u2019s inconsiderate for parents not to curb this behavior when it\u2019s in their control.\n\nSmith noted that there are situations when a little understanding goes a long way, however.\n\n\u201cIf someone has special needs and occasionally shouts out, you\u2019re just going to have to bear with them,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s who that person is, and it\u2019s probably stressful for whoever is traveling with them.\u201d\n\nBe An Overhead Bin Thief\n\nAlthough airline baggage fees encourage people to carry on more stuff, that doesn\u2019t mean you should take up more than your fair share of space in the overhead bin. And if you can\u2019t lift your bag to stow it in the bin, you probably should\u2019ve checked it.\n\nGottsman described another type of \u201coverhead bin thief\u201d she\u2019s observed on flights. \u201cThis is the person who has a seat in the back but wants his/her luggage to be up front waiting for him/her when they get off the plane,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to carry it all the way back to row 22, so they decide row 8 looks like it\u2019s a nice space.\u201d\n\nAnother rude behavior involving overhead bins is smashing other peoples\u2019 belongings in order to make your overstuffed bag fit. \u201cThis person takes it upon themselves to move the suitcases, totes and carefully placed bags with breakables around to accommodate their own luggage,\u201d Gottsman said.\n\nTake Off Your Shoes\n\nKicking off your shoes to take a nap might feel nice to you, but you may be introducing unpleasant odors into the cabin and making your fellow travelers uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cIf you absolutely have to, just make sure you have a pair of socks on,\u201d said Rossi. \u201cNobody wants to see your scary toes.\u201d\n\nGottsman added: \u201cAnd don\u2019t even think about going to the bathroom barefooted.\u201d\n\nJasmin Merdan via Getty Images Etiquette experts caution against taking your shoes off during a flight.\n\nTime Bathroom Breaks Poorly\n\nAnother inconsiderate plane behavior is choosing to use the bathroom at times that inconvenience cabin crew or fellow passengers.\n\n\u201cUse the bathroom while you\u2019re sitting and waiting in the airport,\u201d said Rossi. \u201cPeople try to use the bathroom right after boarding the plane, which can slow the whole boarding and departure process.\u201d\n\nSmith advised travelers to pay attention to drink and food service times, too. \u201cThose aisles are narrow. If you see them about to take out the drink cart, don\u2019t go to the bathroom at that exact moment,\u201d she said. \u201cTry to go before or after so you\u2019re not shoving them into a row or making them back all the way up. It should be common sense.\u201d\n\nPick Fights With Fellow Passengers\n\n\u201cIf the person next to you is not being respectful, your first line of defense is to speak with them directly and politely,\u201d said Smith, giving the example of a passenger playing something on their iPad loudly.\n\n\u201cSay, \u2018Excuse me, I hate to be a bother, but could you put in your earbuds so that I don\u2019t have to listen to your movie?\u2019\u201d Smith advised. \u201dThe vast majority of people will be like \u2018Oh my gosh, I didn\u2019t even realize, I\u2019m so sorry!\u2019 If they say \u2018no,\u2019 then you can enlist a flight attendant and have them ask the passenger, but you should be a grownup and ask nicely first.\u201d\n\nWhitmore said it\u2019s important to be mindful before creating conflict.\n\n\u201cChoose your battles,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they\u2019re talking too loudly on their cellphone before takeoff, maybe it\u2019s not going to make a big difference to ask them to stop since the conversation will have to end soon anyway. If you can ignore it, ignore it. But if it\u2019s encroaching on your privacy or well-being, say something politely or take up your grievance with the flight attendant.\u201d\n\nRecline Into Someone\u2019s Knees\n\nAlthough you have the opportunity to recline once the plane reaches cruising altitude, you don\u2019t have to put your seat all the way back.\n\n\u201cThink before you recline,\u201d said Gottsman. \u201cLook around you and your environment. There might be a small child or someone of smaller stature behind you, so you\u2019ll have more room to recline. But if someone is 6\u20325 and struggling to be seated to begin with, it\u2019s going to be uncomfortable. You should take their comfort into consideration because it\u2019s just the kind thing to do.\u201d\n\nExit Before The People Ahead Of You\n\nObviously everyone is eager to get off the plane, but it\u2019s rude to jump ahead and ignore the orderly row-by-row exit system \u2015 even if you have no luggage.\n\n\u201cUnless you are about to miss a flight \u2015 in which case you should alert the flight attendant \u2015 it\u2019s polite to wait your turn for your aisle to deplane,\u201d said Gottsman.\n\nRossi offered other reasons for waiting your turn.", "description": "Etiquette experts share their top air travel faux pas.", "authors": ["Culture", "Amp", "Parenting Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da0b882200000d40650007e.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
