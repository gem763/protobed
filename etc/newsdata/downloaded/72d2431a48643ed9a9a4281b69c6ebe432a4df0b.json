Yes, you read that right. A Monmouth University poll finds that 81% of voters say the American way of life is \u201cunder threat right now\u201d \u2014 a sentiment echoed almost equally among Republicans, independents and Democrats, among men and women, whites and minorities, old and young, rich and poor.\n\nThere\u2019s another remarkable question on this poll which suggests that somehow, voters are not blaming Mr. Trump for their heightened state of anxiety. The Monmouth poll also found that 56% of all voters do not feel that their personal way of life will be \u201cunder threat\u201d if Mr. Trump is reelected. Pronounced divides about this question were only found among political or ideological leanings: 88% of Republicans and 60% of independents don\u2019t fear Mr. Trump\u2019s election; 22% of Democrats do, however.\n\n\u201cIt does appear that nearly three years of a Trump presidency has tempered, if not erased, some of the public\u2019s concern that he would upend our day-to-day lives,\u201d notes Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.\n\nSo how did the nation get to this anxious state? We can point the finger at the news media for providing nonstop coverage with an emphasis on melodrama and outrage rather than helpful perspectives and fact-driven news. We can also fault the general lack of civility in the public discourse among people who should know better, or the weakening of long time cultural or social bastions. Impeachment obsession on Capitol Hill is also annoying the public, and enhancing the \u201cdo nothing\u201d image of Congress.\n\nYes, well.\n\nFind more numbers in the Poll du Jour a column\u2019s end.\n\nALL IN FOR KEN CUCCINELLI\n\n\u201cConservatives unequivocally support Ken Cuccinelli for the position of Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security,\u201d declares a very large group of powerful, well-known conservatives who are convinced that the former Virginia attorney general is just the man for the job.\n\nThis group includes former Sen. Jim DeMint, publisher Al Regnery, presidential historian Craig Shirley, Citizens United President David Bossie and over 100 more.

Expect lots of squawking, given the recent notable increase in Democratic aggression against President Trump and his administration with impeachment and Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to remove U.S. military forces from Syria in particular focus.\n\nIn case you are wondering, Sen. Bernard Sanders, who is still recovering from a recent heart attack, will be with his colleagues for the big evening \u2014 which is the fourth of a dozen Democratic debates on the party\u2019s schedule.\n\nCNN regulars Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett plus New York Times national editor Marc Lacey are the moderators for the evening; the event can be seen on CNN and its assorted online presence plus The New York Times home page.\n\nOh, and there\u2019s drama.\n\n\u201cBusinessman and Democratic activist Tom Steyer will be a brand new face on the debate stage. Steyer dropped millions of dollars of his personal fortune on advertising in early states with the intention of securing qualifying polls to join the stage,\u201d points out Election Central editor in chief Nate Ashworth.\n\n\u201cSteyer is unlikely to qualify for November so this will probably be his first and last debate appearance,\u201d he observes.\n\nARNOLD: I\u2019LL BE BACK\n\nAnd now a word about former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has spent recent years as a policy wonk and public speaker after founding the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy at the University of Southern California. Mr. Schwarzenegger has just signed on with United Talent Agency \u2014 aka UTA \u2014 a major force in showbiz. Why?\n\n\u201cThe blockbuster superstar\u2019s films have grossed more than $4.7 billion worldwide. The news of his signing with UTA comes before the November 1 release of the forthcoming \u2018Terminator: Dark Fate\u2019 where he \u2018will be back\u2019 in the titular role. He will also star in the forthcoming \u2018Kung Fury 2\u2019 and will lend his voice to the late Stan Lee\u2019s animated family series \u2018Superhero Kindergarten,\u2019\u201d Deadline Hollywood reports.\n\nMr. Schwarzenegger himself is happy to be the Terminator, meanwhile.\n\n\u201cThis is the character that changed my life. I\u2019m so proud to be back,\u201d tweeted the actor, now 72.\n\nENHANCING THAT VICTORY FEELING\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s campaign is upping the ante in the 2020 race, sending forth a small army of high-profile folks to ramp up local interest prior to Mr. Trump\u2019s signature Keep America Great rallies.
