But American will not have the future we want if we're not willing to clean up the past, to clean up this original character defect of racism,' the best-selling author said in the spot. 'Whatever it costs, it's time to do this.'\n\nThe ad is only running in South Carolina currently, her campaign told DailyMail.com. 'We just started buying TV and are assessing it,' spokeswoman Patricia Ewing said. 'We are starting slow and well-targeted and [then] will expand,' she added.\n\nDemocratic hopeful Marianne Williamson has made support for reparations a centerpiece of her campaign. On Tuesday she released a new ad, which will be televised in South Carolina\n\nDemocratic candidate Marianne Williamson released a new ad touting her support for reparations to those Americans who are descendents of slaves\n\nMarianne Williamson's new ad, which is running in South Carolina where there are a higher percentage of black voters, includes KKK imagery as she argues for reparations\n\nMarianne Williamson's new political ad points out that black Americans have been susceptive to 350 years of violence, pre-dating the founding of the United States\n\nSouth Carolina is the third state that will vote for the Democratic hopefuls and it has a higher percentage of black voters following Iowa and New Hampshire, which go first.\n\nThe spot points out that black American have been susceptive to 350 years of violence - longer than the country's existence - and includes imagery of the Ku Klux Klan burning a cross.\n\nWilliamson's push for reparations has become a centerpiece of her long-shot campaign for the nomination.\n\nShe had a big moment during July's Democratic debate in Detroit - the last time Oprah's spiritual guru made the debate stage as many candidates have been squeezed out due to the Democratic National Committee's qualifying rules.\n\nCNN's Don Lemon, one of the debate's moderators, asked her how she was qualified to come up with the $200 to $500 billion price tag she had said would be needed for her plan.\n\n'What makes me qualified to say $200 to $500 billion? I'll tell you what makes me qualified. If you did the math of 40 acres and a mule. If you If you did the math today it would be trillions of dollars,' she explained. 'And I believe anything less than $100 billion is an insult.'\n\nShe called the $200 to $500 billion 'politically feasible.'\n\n'Because so many Americabns realize there is injustice that continues to form a toxicity beneath the surce, an emotional turbulence, that only reparations will heal,' Williamson argued.\n\nCapitalizing from her debate momentum, in August she pushed out an official plan.\n\nBut Williamson hasn't made much of a mark on the race since.\n\nReal Clear Politics currently has her polling average at .2 percent.\n\nIn D.C. last week, she said she's been a victim of a smear campaign.\n\n'The illusion, she's anti-medicine, anti-science, none of which is true, crazy, dangerous lady, none of which is true,' Williamson said.\n\nShe blamed the digs on people frightened by her early success.\n\n'I sure as hell have broken through, it was called the second debate. And it's because of my popularity after the second debate, it was because of the fact that I was Googled more than any other candidate in 49 states, that the political hits began,' she said.", "description": "Marianne Williamson debuted a new ad that is focused on the Democratic 2020 hopeful's support for reparations.", "authors": ["Nikki Schwab", "Senior U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/18/20390022-0-image-a-52_1572459400628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
