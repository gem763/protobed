I am waiting for the toilet cubicle; he is at the helm of the flimsy little aisle cart. Halfway down the plane, the riotous cause of the man\u2019s breezy suicidal thoughts, \u201cCoxy\u2019s Stag Do\u201d, is once again firing up a flat, bellowed rendition of The Beatles\u2019 \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d. Back in my seat, the chanting makes it hard to concentrate on a particularly dense passage of Kafka\u2019s The Castle. A baby cries. The plane continues to hurtle towards Prague, Kafka\u2019s city.\n\nIn the summer of 1911, while lake-hopping through southern Europe, a 28-year old Kafka and his best friend Max Brod struck on an idea that they thought could earn them millions of Austro-Hungarian kroner: travel guides. The idea never went beyond the point of business plan, but the men were serious. It was \u201csupposed to make us millionaires,\u201d said Brod. As well as giving insider tips, these guides would protect people from tourist traps.\n\nToday, Franz is himself a tourist trap. I am stood in the middle of Prague\u2019s Old Town Square \u2013 one section of a \u201clittle circle\u201d within which, Kafka said, \u201cmy whole life is contained\u201d. A woman walks past holding a sort of wooden lollipop with Franz\u2019s printed face on it; she trails a group of Americans with enormous cameras hanging from their necks. I am in Prague to investigate the Kafkaesque and chase down Franz Kafka\u2019s ghost.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhen he was very ill, Kafka told Brod that, with the exception of six of his short stories, all his papers and manuscripts were to be \u201cburnt unread and to the last page\u201d. Brod disobeyed him, and in 1939 he managed to smuggle all of Kafka\u2019s papers out of Prague on the very last train to cross the Czech-Polish border before the Nazis sealed it. Whether or not Kafka had really meant his request (and many think he didn\u2019t): here we are. Kafka is a long way from unread. He is also voluminously written about: in 1946, the great Hannah Arendt correctly predicted that Kafka would \u201ckeep generations of intellectuals both gainfully employed and well-fed\u201d.\n\nWith a long list of Kafka destinations starred in my Google Maps, I set off. According to the Slovak owner of the AirBnb my wife and I are renting, all Czechs are depressed, which is why Kafka is so quintessentially Czech. A harmless bit of patriotic banter, but it\u2019s true: Franz Kafka was not a happy man. Whatever it is Prague has made a tourist attraction of, it is not the example that Franz set for how to live a contented life.\n\nReading biographies is generally a deflating sort of pleasure; even geniuses are revealed as sordidly, boringly human. Kafka was weighed down by what he himself called an \u201cinsane selfishness\u201d. Labouring under an ornate Madonna-whore complex, he was a nagging, outlandishly manipulative romantic partner. Far outdoing his published fiction for word count are thousands of love letters that display a theatrical self-loathing mostly too opaque to rise to the level of emotional coercion. Kafka complained that his family was oppressive and cruel, even as he lived with them rent-free well into his thirties and let his mother cook him dinner every night.\n\nKafka was a chronic insomniac beset by constant headaches and a weak stomach, and yet his was what he called a \u201cself-enamoured hypochondria\u201d. He loathed his body, and was forever imagining himself as something sub-human. In his diary, he appears perpetually daunted and crushed by life, and obsessed with the nature of his angst. Which is why, in the general literary imagination, Kafka functions as a sort of anti-Hemingway: hypersensitive, fragile, all brain and no brawn, a sort of life-size raw nerve stumbling through a cruel world. Milan Kundera, Prague\u2019s second-most-famous writer, has bemoaned the emergence of the cult of personality he dubs \u201cKafkology\u201d, which \u201cdelights in discussing the martyrdom of his impotence. Thus Kafka long ago became the patron saint of the neurotic, the depressive, the anorexic, the feeble.\u201d\n\nIn Anglophone culture, this Kafkology extends to the clich\u00e9d Kafka reader, who is framed as the emo kid of fiction: pale, tremulous, inert, ruminating on their own nihilism. Like most clich\u00e9s, this one is often unfair, but more than occasionally accurate. On a street whose cobbles have surely twisted many a tourist ankle, I find The Franz Kafka Society. Their HQ is narrow and stuffy, and empty apart from the two staff members, who are avoiding eye contact while debating what \u201cghost\u201d means in Swiss as compared to German. They are making no effort to flog the shop\u2019s panoply of bookmarks and fridge magnets and postcards and miniature busts. The walls make up a sea of doleful Kafka eyes.\n\nThus Kafka long ago became the patron saint of the neurotic, the depressive, the anorexic, the feeble Milan Kundera, Czech writer\n\nThey are scattered across Prague, the eyes. Just when I have stopped thinking about Franz\u2019s face, there he is, blown up to pixelated proportions on a caf\u00e9 awning. There is no escaping the fact that Kafka would have found this idea \u2013 an artist whose jazzy name and piercing gaze is a bigger selling point than their actual art \u2013 worthy of a short story. One last black joke. They are much mythologised, in the Kafka hagiography, his eyes. No one can agree on what colour they were. Here in Prague they are whatever colour fits the establishment\u2019s brand palette.\n\nTwelve-foot-high and solid bronze, the Kafka statue is an upright empty suit with a smaller man perched on its shoulders. People line up and take turns to get photographs, most of them smiling with a feigned naturalness that Franz himself found it agonizing to try and muster. Behind the statue is one of Prague\u2019s synagogues, built on a site of Jewish worship that dates back 800 years. Kafka belonged, as Benjamin Balint puts it, \u201cto a Jewish minority within a German-speaking minority within a Czech minority within a heterogeneous Austro-Hungarian Empire being pulled apart by the centrifugal force of rival nationalisms\u201d. Towards the end of his life, Kafka encountered regular antisemitic rants in the Czech paper Venkov (Country). He passed away in 1924, but all three of his sisters died in Nazi gas chambers.\n\nIn what I quickly realise is a rather unremarkable coincidence \u2013 Prague\u2019s Old Town isn\u2019t very big, and it\u2019s where all the tourists spend 90 per cent of their time \u2013 \u201cCoxy\u2019s Stag Do\u201d lumber past. Despite the heat of the day, Coxy himself is decked out in full Mexican garb, red-faced under his sombrero and already slow-eyed with drink. Everyone is putting the horrors of history out of their mind; what\u2019s the alternative? I get lunch. The only place I have felt less warmth from waiters is in Moscow. I don\u2019t blame them. We can still see the Kafka statue from our corner caf\u00e9, until my view is obscured by two \u201cbeer bikes\u201d trundling by, on which shirtless compatriots of mine bellow out a rendition of DJ Pied Piper and the Masters of Ceremonies\u2019 \u201cDo You Really Like It?\u201d\n\nWalking back towards the AirBnb, we pass a bust of Rainer Maria Rilke, another Prague-born writer. The bust is perched on the wall above a Lacoste, out of the entrance of which emerge a middle-aged Chinese couple having a tremendous row. It occurs to me that Kafka could have used some of Rilke\u2019s lyrical hopefulness. Franz enjoyed swimming, and yet he was (in his own words) \u201cphysically inactive, everlastingly occupied with himself.\u201d If only he had spent more time in the pool and less time writing his letters, which he himself declared were \u201cnothing but torture, born of torture, create only torture, incurable torture\u201d. All the misfortune of his life derived from \u201cthe evil sorcerer of letter-writing\u201d, he told one of his lovers \u2013 in a letter.\n\nNothing but torture, born of torture, create only torture, incurable torture Kafka, on letter-writing\n\nKafka was brutally sensitive to noise, and could sleep in nothing less than total silence. He went to great lengths to source wax ear plugs from Berlin. Prague is noisy at night, and I too like the quiet. I have the benefit of ear plugs made from silicone, a substance not invented until around the time Kafka passed away. Cocooned in artificial silence, I read about Franz\u2019s investment in an asbestos factory \u2013 another black joke, with hindsight \u2013 until my eyes won\u2019t stay open.\n\nKafka portrayed modern humankind as helplessly swept along by currents of influence it could neither control nor comprehend. Visit enough Kafka-related tourist spots and it all starts to feel a little, well, Kafkaesque. The young Franz sniffed at the tourists he saw collecting souvenir photographs, and mocked the amateur photographers with their cumbersome equipment. And yet here they are, queueing up again, dedicated Kafka fans.\n\nIn Excavating Kafka, the author James Hawes attempts to demolish the myth of Kafka as a \u201ctortured quasi-saintly genius\u201d and reveal him to have been an essentially stable and ordinary man. Certainly Franz seemed to mythologise his own suffering, always straining to imbue it with a metaphysical gravitas. \u201cDon\u2019t you enjoy exaggerating painful things as much as possible?\u201d he once asked a friend in (naturally) a letter.\n\nDespite how enthusiastically the city has claimed him, the fact is Kafka didn\u2019t even like Prague. \u201cThis old crone has claws,\u201d he said in 1902; the only way to escape it would be to burn it down. Partly this was adolescent impatience with one\u2019s stuffy hometown; but it lingered. \u201cMy life in Prague is leading to nothing good,\u201d he declared in 1915. In 1920 he dubbed the city a place \u201cof dolefulness, of pettiness, of shame, of being misled, of misuse of energy\u201d.\n\nThe happiest period of Kafka\u2019s life was the eight months he spent in the rural Bohemian town of Z\u00fcrau. He dreamed constantly of moving to Berlin, and nine months before he died, he finally managed it. He and his last love, Dora Diamant, stayed there for four months. Weimar hyperinflation left them so hard up that one New Year they had to heat their dinner using candle stubs.\n\nKafka wrote that \u201cthere is only one cardinal vice: impatience\u201d. I am consumed with the cardinal vice as we shuffle through the first room of the Kafka museum. Black and white footage of Prague a century ago looks truly grim. Franz had handwriting deserving of the adjective spidery. I try and feel the crossings-outs out as some sort of glimpse of the beyond.\n\nThere is only one cardinal vice: impatience Kafka\n\nKafka\u2019s oeuvre is full of characters who don\u2019t eat enough, or even starve themselves to death. Kafka himself was a fastidious vegetarian, and also a devotee of a pseudoscientific fad called \u201cFletcherizing\u201d, in which one chews each mouthful a hundred times. When we go to a nearby restaurant, I am hampered by none of these obstacles, wolfing down thick slices of pork, enormous dumplings, and mountains of cabbage, everything drowned in gravy.\n\nIn response to a description of a friend\u2019s 1902 pilgrimage to the Goethe House in Weimar, Kafka (somewhat insensitively) replied that such pilgrimages were a mirage: \u201cWe cannot ever have the all-holiest of someone else,\u201d he wrote.\u201d Nonetheless, ten years later, Kafka made his own pilgrimage. He wandered around the house and found little trace of Johann, noting that the beech tree that darkened Goethe\u2019s study had gone on mindlessly growing since the great writer\u2019s death. Kafka was more interested in the daughter of the caretaker, with whom he became fleetingly obsessed.\n\nI pass his statue again. Still the queues, the photographs. To judge by Kafka\u2019s diaries, he always felt inescapably alone. His grasping after the Jewish soul \u2013 his late attempt to learn Hebrew; his pipedream of a move to Palestine \u2013 was all a sort of craving for belonging. So too, in its way, was his naturalism. He was constantly fleeing to rural sanatoriums where he could sunbathe naked in the woods; his very last act in life was to lift himself from his deathbed to smell a bunch of flowers. That cosmic lack, that haunts all his fiction.\n\n***\n\nKafka\u2019s most perfect short story is \u201cIn the Penal Colony\u201d. Published exactly one century ago this month, it features a complex and brutal machine that tortures then executes people by inscribing their sentence into their skin. Each of the executed receives no trial, and doesn\u2019t know what crime he has committed \u2013 until, after six hours, he \u201cdeciphers it with his wounds,\u201d and a cruel beatific understanding washes over him. An officer of the colony pines for the days when a former commandant put the ageing machine to more use. Watched by a travelling researcher, the officer is meant to display the machine by executing a condemned man. Instead, the officer eventually clambers into his beloved machine himself. The instrument of justice malfunctions and rapidly kills the officer, and on his perished face there is \u201cno trace of the promised transfiguration\u201d. After a visit to the old commandant\u2019s grave, the traveller rushes to the harbour and flees the colony.\n\nKafka is an author so sanctified that, as Zadie Smith puts it, readers see him as \u201csullied by our attempts to define him\u201d. But his genius comes down to this: Kafka is an author of the unconscious. His work is unique within literature for being stripped of identifying markers \u2013 the penal colony could be anywhere; none of the characters have names \u2013 and this blankness is one part of what makes his tales feel like little black missives from the underground mind. When it works, Kafka\u2019s writing seems to poke a thin needle into places that other stories don\u2019t go.\n\nBut his genius comes down to this: Kafka is an author of the unconscious\n\nWhat remains with you, even years after reading, are flashes, images, small bundles of mute feeling. With \u201cIn the Penal Colony\u201d, what should echo is that grisly machine. But it isn\u2019t; it\u2019s the awful moment at the very end when the condemned man and a soldier suddenly run after the traveller to try and join him on his departing boat, and yet Kafka tells us that even in their desperation the two men \u201cdidn\u2019t dare raise their voices\u201d. The traveller brandishes a \u201cheavy knotted rope\u201d at them, and they don\u2019t jump aboard. The boat sails away. Why are they suddenly desperate? If they are that desperate, why don\u2019t they shout, or jump? Why is this so terrible to me? I don\u2019t know. But I can\u2019t shake it.\n\nThis is the real genius of Kafka \u2013it\u2019s slippery, it gets away from you: his ability to conjure images that are absurd, almost to the point of parody, but that also register like white-hot distillations extracted from nightmares you had. Kafka\u2019s narrators are among the loneliest in all of literature. They are chronic overthinkers, and their increasingly fastidious, increasingly verbose overthinking takes them further and further from any resolution.\n\nThis is the Kafkaesque: precise, fussy thinking exhausting itself, achieving nothing. The ultimate failure of the mind, in its encounter with the external, to play mimic. As in the excellent \u201cThe Stoker\u201d, Kafka\u2019s characters are constantly running out of time to explain themselves to others, or would need so much time to even begin to explain themselves that it would be absurd, beyond the ken of human attention or of conversational etiquette. Every narrator\u2019s interpersonal phenomenology is a sort of runaway equation, rapidly becoming too complex to ever reasonably dissect. Everyone is always embarrassed at being trapped inside themselves. This is the real tragedy at the heart of Kafka\u2019s famous bureaucracies: they care nothing for the inner life. Not even actively; just out of sheer indifference.\n\nThis is the Kafkaesque: precise, fussy thinking exhausting itself, achieving nothing\n\nThe macro dread of Kafka\u2019s work is the feeling that will creep up on you if you watch tourists walk around Prague for too long with too cynical an eye: why? So many photographs being taken. So many sausages being consumed. Why? This is the real heart of the Kafkaesque, the heart that you can only feel beating when you actually read him: the total inscrutability of reality, the impotence of rational explanation. Motivations are an utter mystery in Kafka\u2019s work. People never get what they deserve. In The Trial, Josef K. is always trying to apply a fastidious rationality to proceedings, and always finding his life turn to ash in his hands.\n\nKafka didn\u2019t much like music, and there is a fundamental discord to his fictional worlds. It\u2019s like trying to punch someone underwater. A go-to adjective for describing Kafka\u2019s writing is nightmarish, but in fact there is none of the lurid threat or bombast of nightmare. There is just a vast opaqueness. Kafka\u2019s fiction manifests the special pain \u2013 endemic to deranging, clinical sorts of melancholy \u2013 of bending all of one\u2019s powers of reason and analysis to reality, and finding that it won\u2019t conform, won\u2019t cohere. Angst is like this: above the roiling emotional tides, the breaking waves of thought are in fact painstakingly lucid. And yet your life keeps revealing to you that what feels like problem-solving is pure inertia. If you\u2019ve ever felt bound in this knot then you have felt the Kafkaesque.\n\nAll gloomy stuff; but then all great art has at its heart the recognition that life is no picnic, and people who are in some core way discombobulated by life are overrepresented among literature lovers. You might have noticed that the classics aren\u2019t generally marketed as uplifting or feel-good. Perhaps you can tap a sort of humour in his work \u2013 for all of the angst in his diaries and his letters, Kafka (and his listeners) used to laugh out loud during his readings \u2013 otherwise all you can do is find solace in its strange clarity.\n\nAnd it is a sort of solace. In the academy, generalisations about literature\u2019s function or purpose are anathema. But I fled the academy, so I can say it: Great literature is communion. Life is, at bottom, lonely. A being-stranded-in-one\u2019s-skull. Kafka knew this as well as anyone. Aged twenty, he wrote to a friend: \u201cWe are as forlorn as children lost in the woods. When you stand in front of me and look at me, what do you know of the griefs that are in me and what do I know of yours?\u201d And later: \u201cI have seldom, very seldom, crossed this borderland between loneliness and fellowship.\u201d\n\nWhen you stand in front of me and look at me, what do you know of the griefs that are in me and what do I know of yours? Kafka\n\nThere is an isolation to the fact of being produced by a human brain, but literature can offer little glimpses of something else: the stunned sense that little lightning bolts might be mirrored across our private globes, strange currents of perception and feeling stirred by the signs of another. Everyone who loves writing is hooked on these glimpses of evidence, couriered by alphabets, that someone else has also known that particular play of shadows on that particular surface of the mind. Kafka\u2019s writing does it with a cold embrace, but it is still a consolation: forces and energies, hitherto subterranean, suddenly made solid, made sharp enough to lodge like a splinter in the private timber of your being. \u201cA cage went in search of a bird,\u201d goes one of Kafka\u2019s most famous aphorisms. At its best, literature is just this: the bird.\n\nAnother day, another grumpy waiter. He looks down at my wife and me with vacant disdain; like the silently ruminating narrator of many a Kafka short story, part of me wants to transmit to him things that would take too long to say: I\u2019m not only here to get drunk, I\u2019m interested in the history, the language, Kafka, all of it. I voted Remain! Never mind; we\u2019ll leave a generous tip.\n\nI am Kafka at the Goethe house. My enthusiasm for my ghost hunt has well and truly waned. Keep eating dumplings; dumplings are real. What am I doing, peering up at this building which more than a century ago was Kafka\u2019s birthplace, the bottom floor of which is now a souvenir shop selling miniature rubber cockroaches sporting his head? Why am I standing once again in the Old Town square, ignoring the pesterings of a man wearing a giant billboard and the racket of yet another stag do as I try to pick out the particular window behind which Franz once laid his troubled head? What weird osmosis am I hoping for by taking a seat in the Caf\u00e9 Louvre, where he used to hang out?\n\nInstead of traipsing around more places adorned with Franz\u2019s doleful eyes, I sit in the merciful shade and read my Kafka biography. Near the end of his life, I discover, Kafka became (in his final lover\u2019s words) \u201ca passionate drinker\u201d of beer. Why? Because when he was a boy, he and his father would go to the public swimming pool, and afterwards they would drink beer. In June of 1924, Kafka wrote a letter to his parents. Though he knew by now that his body was giving up on him, he summoned an optimism that for a man of his temperament was a sort of heroism. He suggested, in his letter, that sometime soon he and his parents might all spend a few days in the countryside: \u201cIn the past, as I often remember, during the heat spells, we used to have beer together quite often, in that far-off time when Father would take me along to the public swimming pool.\u201d It was the last letter he ever sent his parents. He passed away the following day, after breathing in the bunch of flowers.\n\nI am suddenly guilty about the stein I am mindlessly sipping. I would give it to Franz to share with his old man, if I could. This master of the literary unconscious, when time was running out, was still reaching out for the same thing we all crave: A bridging of the borderland. A vision of our selves as just a little more porous at the edges. We crave it in literature because we crave it in life, because the cage will take as many birds as it can fit. Only connect: if only it were that easy. When nowhere else will do, memory will do. Franz, it turns out, was chasing his own ghost a hundred years before I arrived.\n\nFranz, it turns out, was chasing his own ghost a hundred years before I arrived\n\nThe conclusion of my report to an academy: one should expect only the very shallowest sort of revelation from the literary pilgrimage. Whatever remains, whatever is real, survives purely as that dense and ethereal thing: language. Despite having planned it for my last afternoon, I decide not to Uber out to Kafka\u2019s grave. What is left down there? Bones, perhaps a skull fixed in a perfectly Kafkaesque rictus of stunned incomprehension. Franz\u2019s kilogram-and-a-bit of brain tissue, source of the psychic pointillism that powered his impossible stories, would have rotted to nothing by the autumn of 1924. Whatever remains lives in one place and one place only: on the page. No: in that brief limbo created when the page encounters another mind.\n\nEnough traipsing, I decide. No graves. On the final evening before easyJet will catapult us out of Kafka\u2019s city, my wife and I make our way up to the heights of Vy\u0161ehrad castle and watch the sun melt into the Vltava river. This, surely, Franz would have laid his doleful eyes on. Something shared there, perhaps; the clarity of the natural, impossible to offend with interpretation. Prague is quiet from up here, and almost too pretty to bear. There is \u201cplenty of hope, an infinite amount of hope,\u201d said Franz, \u201cbut not for us\u201d.\n\nIt feels like hope tonight, though: my arm round the woman I love, great life-giving fireball turning the water orange. Kafka laughing out loud at his readings; hold on to that. We walk back down from the castle: reality is opaque, there is suffering to come, but for now we have endless beer and a warm bed and only connecting. Just like every other tourist, in the end. \u201cIn the struggle between yourself and the world,\u201d Kafka wrote, \u201chold the world\u2019s coat.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a dark carnival, but fear needs to be given shape, if it is to be wrestled with. Kafka\u2019s genius: those narrative chunks that petrify you, then follow you around, nag at you, for reasons you can\u2019t describe. The Trial has a recurring motif of people watching people from windows. Another thing of Kafka\u2019s I can\u2019t shake. Something about others always being squinting distance away, being on the verge of drawing the curtains on us \u2013 a running out of time to explain ourselves, a never laying a hand on the shoulders of our ghosts for more than one fine moment. At the end of the novel, as Josef K. awaits his final judgement, we read:\n\n\u201cHis gaze fell upon the top story of the building adjoining the quarry. Like a light flicking on, the casements of a window flew open, a human figure, faint and insubstantial at that distance and height, leaned far out abruptly, and stretched both arms out even further. Who was it? A friend? A good person? Someone who cared? Someone who wanted to help? Was it just one person? Was it everyone? Was there still help? Were there objections that had been forgotten? Of course there were. Logic is no doubt unshakeable, but it can\u2019t withstand a person who wants to live.\u201d", "description": "If I had a gun, I\u2019d shoot myself in the face.\u201d The diaries of\u00a0Franz Kafka\u00a0include various reflections on\u00a0suicide, but none of them more explicit than this one, which I hear delivered in a warm Welsh accent by a man whose\u00a0easyJet\u00a0uniform is so punishingly tight it is hard to look at.", "authors": ["Mm Owen"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/14/09/Prague-Anthony-Delanoix-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
