With her studies starting to severely suffer and her future looking a lot less bright, Raffy is close to breaking point when Dr Alex (Zoe Ventoura) mentions there is another trial starting up in Victoria.\n\nJustin (James Stewart) is reluctant to let her go on it until he speaks more with Dr Alex \u2013 and also Brody (Jackson Heywood). He then returns to his little sister and says that if she\u2019s accepted onto the trial, she can go and live with Brody and Simone (Emily Eskell).\n\nThe teen\u2019s luck starts to turn around as Raffy excitedly announces she\u2019s been accepted, and Justin is overjoyed that she will be able to start getting back on the right path with her life. Raffy is nervous about how to tell Marilyn (Emily Symons) and John (Shane Withington) she\u2019s leaving, but Justin says they\u2019ll do it together.\n\nMarilyn is upset that Raffy is leaving (Picture: Channel 5)\n\nWhile Maz and John are genuinely happy for Raffy, Marilyn lets the act of pure happiness drop once Raffy has left and lets her devastation trickle in. She\u2019s heartbroken that her foster daughter is leaving, especially after Jett recently left the Bay to build a new life in the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Ryder (Lukas Radovich) is also shaken to find that his best friend is leaving, but Raffy reassures him they will still be mates. As the trial is starting soon, Raffy leaves in the afternoon, being congratulated by Mason (Orpheus Pledger) as she prepares to go. Everyone gathers around her as she says goodbye, and she waves from the car as Justin drives her to the airport.\n\nHowever, while Raffy is clearly overjoyed to be starting a new chapter in life, Marilyn and John are devastated that she didn\u2019t even say goodbye properly. The pair have had barely any time to wrap their heads around the fact Raffy is leaving, and all of a sudden she\u2019s simply disappeared without acknowledging them\u2026.\n\nMORE: Home and Away spoilers: Dean reveals an upsetting secret to Karen\n\nMORE: Home and Away spoilers: Jasmine leaves Robbo in heartbreaking scenes\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "John, Marilyn, Ryder, Mason and Justin have mixed feelings as Raffy hastily departs the Bay.", "authors": ["Imogen Groome"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Home_and_Away_7119_28-965f_1571990296.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
