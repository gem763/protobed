His brother, Ben, was killed in the explosions.\n\nThe Pike River Recovery Agency will soon begin work to remove the seal and move further into the mine working areas, where the 29 victims were thought to be when the explosions happened.\n\nThe blasts ripped through the mine on the west coast of New Zealand\u2019s South Island, trapping 31 men. Only two of them managed to escape.\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern had promised while in opposition that her Labour Party would try to enter the mine if it won the 2017 election.\n\nThe previous government had ruled out re-entering the mine due to safety concerns, a stance that had been opposed by many family members of the men who died.", "description": "A survivor and relatives of 29 men who died nine years ago in one of New Zealand's worst industrial disasters visited the Pike River mine on Thursday, ahead of government attempts to make a full recovery of the site.", "authors": ["Hans Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
