Several odd decisions and a tactical inconsistency have caused concern, but he should only be fully judged with a pre-season behind him. PA\n\nThe good mood among the squad from pre-season has so quickly evaporated, shown to be as fragile as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s midfield.\n\nAn incomplete team have taken just five points from four games so far, to make it a mere 13 from the last 13 in all, and illustrate this is no simple blip or temporary drop-off.\n\nIt is the \u201csituation\u201d many in the game are dismissive of. United are not seen as a club even close to competing for the top trophies right now. They are widely seen as a dysfunctional club, with so many issues.\n\nAny one of those issues are worthy of deep debate on their own - from the actual level of Solskjaer as a coach, to the level of the squad, to the recruitment process - but the reason they are there in the first place, and unlikely to be resolved, is because of the one fundamental issue at the centre of it all.\n\nUnited don\u2019t seem to know what they want to be as a football club.\n\nThey want to be the best and biggest in the world, sure, but that is an aim as vague as some of their planning and decision-making.\n\nThe real issue is they don\u2019t seem to have a clear vision as to what is required to become that, or an articulated philosophy that underpins everything. Every issue, and every single choice, stems from that.\n\nThis is all distilled in the indecision over the role of technical director. It is alas not personified by the technical director, since there remains none, and thereby no idea of a team.\n\nThat is after all the position that would decide so much of this, not least the type of football team they actually want to be. Hence the situation right now where their squad has six centre-halves but only two centre forwards, and is one injury away from crisis in every other area.\n\nHence a team that seems to only really be comfortable when counter-attacking, even though the very fact they are a big club will mean they automatically have the majority of possession in the majority of games.\n\nHence these results, and this situation. Hence the profound need for a blueprint to offer clarity about where they\u2019re going.\n\nUnited don\u2019t have to go very far, however, if they want a tangible vision of what works.\n\nThey can just go over the road to Manchester City, in another damning reversal of history. United, despite so many forewarnings have made many of the same mistakes Liverpool did in the early 1990s. Their basic complacency allowed a previously subdued rival to completely surpass them.\n\nBack in 2009, when the recently taken-over City were looking to undertake their own transformation, executive Brian Marwood would often take a pointed detour past Old Trafford on his daily drive. \u201cIt was a reminder of what greatness looked like,\u201d the book \u2018The Club\u2019 reveals.\n\n\u201cWe needed to remove the excuses,\u201d Marwood added. \u201cWe wanted to create a best-in-class environment, but then we needed to know what best in class looked like.\u201d\n\nIt now looks exactly like City 2019. The repeat Premier League champions have become just that by stealing a march on the rest of the field. City are at the forefront of absolutely every area of football, from development to the finished product, that ends in so many goals that represent the very cutting edge of the sport\u2019s tactics.\n\nMuch of this was because they went out and wholesale appropriated the brains trust behind the best in the world - \u201cthe Apple of football - in Barcelona 2008-11, who have further proven that in Manchester.\n\nOn the pitch, Pep Guardiola has so insightfully integrated all of the actual sport\u2019s latest evolutions - most pointedly, Jurgen Klopp\u2019s counter-pressing - into his possession-pressing approach to ensure it remains the dominant tactical ideology.\n\nIn the boardroom, director of football Txiki Begiristain commands the greatest network of contacts and expertise in the game, which essentially provides the database for a level of strategising that trumps anyone else.\n\nBeyond all that, chief executive Ferran Soriano has implemented the most ambitious and original idea in sport administration, with the creation of the City Football Group.\n\nAll of these sit in with chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak for the club\u2019s major transfer meetings, to decide which players they should bring in over the next 18 months.\n\nOne of the important elements about this, though, is that there is never a single target discussed at these meetings who hasn\u2019t been rigorously vetted beforehand.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t have a situation, like at United, where a player\u2019s name can suddenly be thrown out at such meetings from nowhere. You wouldn\u2019t have a situation, like at United, where Jose Mourinho actually said no to bidding for Virgil van Dijk in the January 2018 window because he didn\u2019t want a centre-half at that point, only to then decide he absolutely needed one above anything else a few months later. The thinking is far too joined up at City. The different parts of the club are all joined up. One complaint at United is that there is nothing really wrong with the scouting, as such, it\u2019s that the departments don\u2019t seem to complement each other. They\u2019re not feeding an overall plan.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got reports on so many players, but they mostly go ignored,\u201d one source says. \u201cSome of the players they\u2019d spend fortunes on, they\u2019re not as good as better players who they\u2019ve got reports on, but mostly go ignored.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no unity of ideas.\u201d\n\nThis is something said a lot, which is why it\u2019s also said a lot that United are \u201can agent-driven club\u201d. \u201cIf certain players are offered, there\u2019s a better chance of them biting.\u201d It has led to this situation where so many players have been collected over the last six years, but they aren\u2019t necessarily complementary.\n\nThis, again, wouldn\u2019t happen at City. The really important element there is that those highest-level meetings would only ever discuss players they know would fit into the club\u2019s idea of play, something that is now so honed that this can be seen \u201cwithin five minutes\u201d. It minimises mistakes in the market, and maximises everything else.\n\nThis is what it keeps coming back to.\n\nCity - like Liverpool, like Barcelona, like Juventus, like Borussia Dortmund - have such a clear idea of how they want to play, that runs right through their clubs.\n\nSo, in truth, do so many lower-level Premier League sides from Leicester City to Norwich City.\n\nThey all have a more identifiable philosophy than England\u2019s most successful club.\n\nUnited, however, don\u2019t just lack that. They seemingly lack the football knowledge to implement it.\n\nThe big problem - in the words of one prominent European director of football - is that \u201cone of the hardest things in football is coming up with your initial philosophy\u201d. There are all sorts of concerns to consider, not least how the game will evolve. It takes a lot of insight to decide on this, and integrate it throughout a club.\n\nThe great advantage United have, and share with City, is that they also have the money to very quickly correct all their ills. There are of course far bigger debates to be had about the very fact of venture capitalists like the Glazers owning the club - not to mention the extent to which they care about its football side - but it sums up United that they can still generate enough money to specifically fix these problems even in spite of that. And it is amazing how fast things can turn around once you put in place the right steps. Liverpool are the ultimate recent example of that. This is what is so frustrating about watching United. It would be easier for them than almost any other club to change this.\n\nThe challenge, and question, is whether the will is there, or not so much the will, since executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward obviously wants what is best for the club. It\u2019s whether the deeper realisation of what is necessary will ever be there.\n\nSo much of this again comes back to the search for a technical director, since this is precisely the figure who should decide this.\n\nThat search is now going on for just under a year, and appears no closer to completion. Worse, there are questions as to whether they are even close to an idea of what the job would specify.\n\nWoodward has spoken about the role revolving around long-term vision - and something more \u201cholistic\u201d - rather than recruitment.\n\nOthers say the club\u2019s actual actions indicate very differently. One figure whose expertise was consulted in this protracting process says they don\u2019t seem to know what they want, as is illustrated in this long wait to make an appointment.\n\nOne widespread quip has been they may just want \u201ca yes man\u201d.\n\nThe current consensus is that United are actually seeking a committee that would include former players like Darren Fletcher and Rio Ferdinand, feeding into a technical director, with head of corporate development Mike Judge and Woodward then sitting on top of that.\n\nThis committee would seek to bring in a younger profile of players, with an emphasis on a British background, that would be capable of \u201cfast and incisive football\u201d. This, for his part, is what Solskjaer has been trying to implement.\n\nThis, however, isn\u2019t really a philosophy. They are disparate parts, and individual elements.\n\n\u201cBringing through youth\u201d and \u201cfast football\u201d are really just desired end products, not integrated plans and approach.\n\nA further example of this thinking comes when deciding on any target. Whereas City\u2019s judgement is solely based whether a player has the talent and profile to fit the football, United\u2019s is based on whether they would be in any prospective 18-man Champions League final squad.\n\nIt just again feels the wrong way around.\n\nSources say Woodward is keen to go his own way, however, and there is actually a business logic here that does replicate their neighbours\u2019 thinking.\n\nBack in one of the more testing times at City over the last 11 years, Soriano was at a dinner in London explaining the exact thought process behind the club\u2019s planning. The Catalan drew the analogy of a boat race and argued that, when you are behind, it is impossible to get back in the lead by following the same path as the leader. You have to try a different way.\n\nThat lends some sense to United\u2019s approach, but the base reality is you still need football intelligence to identify that different way. The idea of football is itself supposed to be what\u2019s different.\n\nThis is what United lack.\n\nThis is why the team lacks cohesion. This is why they go from different profile of manager to different manager, to so many different styles of players, and can't seem to decide on a technical director. Because there is no unifying football vision.\n\nAs so happens at a football club, the pitch eventually reflects the boardroom, no matter the manager.\n\nThe current manager is now giving serious thought to throwing Mason Greenwood into the team.\n\nThis basic act would be in-keeping with United\u2019s history, but only superficially. That is the issue. It is another reaction to circumstances, rather than part of a greater design.\n\nThat is what is lacking at United. That is the blueprint that is now required. It's the only real way to turn this situation around.", "description": "It was another rejection that was as damning for the club as it was damaging to the team.
