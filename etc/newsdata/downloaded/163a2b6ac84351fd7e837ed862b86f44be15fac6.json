WeWork's parent company had originally proposed that 20 votes for each share of Class A stock given to the company's founders and early investors. Now they will have 10 votes each, according to a regulatory filing in advance of its planned initial public offering.\n\nThose extra votes would completely vanish, becoming only a single vote, if CEO and co-founder Adam Neumann, 40, dies or becomes incapacitated.\n\nNeumann has 2.4 million of those shares, but that's not a majority. Instead, 32.6 million are held by venture capital firm Benchmark Capital Partners and its chief Bruce Dunlevie, a WeWork director. Those super voting shares will still collectively have majority control of the company.\n\nAnother major change in corporate governance in Friday's filing is how Neumann's successor would be named.", "description": "WeWork's parent company said Friday it would make substantial changes to the oversight of its business after investors voiced dissatisfaction with the unusual governance structure ahead of a planned IPO.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore", "Sara O'Brien", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190904103644-wework-chicago-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
