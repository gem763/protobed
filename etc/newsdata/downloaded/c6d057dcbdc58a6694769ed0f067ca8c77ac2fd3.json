A video of the incident has prompted some colorful commentary on social media.\n\nAn unidentified passenger filming from the window of a plane captured the moment that the fox trotted in front of the huge airliner. Apparently unconcerned by the massive flying behemoth, the animal walks across the runway, reaching a patch of grass on the other side. Luckily for the animal, the 747 appears to have already stopped as it waited for its turn to take off.\n\nSome social media users expressed gratitude for the airliner\u2019s careful pilots, while others joked that the fox had flown into Moscow and was now enjoying some caviar. A more serious comment suggested that it was unusual for animals to be in such an area, and that there might be something wrong with the fox.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
