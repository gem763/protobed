I've saved thousands of pounds over the years by shopping like this.'\n\nWhile Lauren had always been into re-using and recycling - now 90% of her wardrobe is second-hand.\n\n'When it comes to clothes it's become more of a hobby rather than a necessity,' she said. 'It's not that I can't afford to go somewhere else for clothes, it's just that I get the fun and excitement out of finding something that's a lot cheaper.'\n\n'I can get an outfit that looks just as good for a fiver rather than paying \u00a350, why wouldn't anybody want to do that?\n\nThe savvy mother has snapped up bargains from designer brands including Moschino, Ralph Lauren and Givenchy for a fraction of their original price by patiently pawing through second-hand rails.

I went to a charity shop that was closing down four years and they had an offer to fill a bag for \u00a31.\n\n'I picked up the dress and had nine other items in the bag, meaning it cost just 10p. I wore it to a black-tie event at a charity boxing match and I got compliments on it.'\n\nNina wearing a 10p dress she bought from a charity shop closing-down sale.

Comments like that fired me up to promote them as I feel so passionate about it.\n\n'There's a stigma towards charity shops but once you've brought an item of clothing home and washed it, it's brand new. Some still have the tags on them, so they've never been worn.\n\n'Baby clothes are barely worn before they're donated to charity shops, a newborn baby's probably been in it twice.\n\nMother-of-two wearing \u00a33.95 jeans, \u00a34 jumper and \u00a36 coat - all from a charity shop - which she paired with patent leather boots gifted from a friend\n\nNina shares her bargains to show people the stylish secondhand outfits that can be found.

I said \"leave it to me, I'll come back with a shirt for you\", which I did. He's a convert now.\n\n'Every six months I go through my wardrobe and if I haven't worn something for a while I'll donate it back to the charity shop.'\n\nThe thrifty mum wearing a Boohoo top bought for \u00a32 from a charity shop, a skirt bought for \u00a35 and shoes for \u00a35 from a clearance shop\n\nThe bargain-hunting beautician has even converted her children, 12-year-old Millie and Keaton Thornton, eight, into following in her thrifty footsteps. Pictured altogether\n\nNina Dixon's dad Stephen Dixon, 62, wearing a YSL jumper she bought for just \u00a36.99 from a charity shop\n\nCharity Retail Association Chief Executive, Robin Osterley, said: 'Charity shops are home to a wide range of high street brands, designer labels and vintage items which have been donated to raise money for good causes.\n\n'Charity shops raise around \u00a3295 million for good causes each year. The choice, quality and value for money offered by charity shops is unrivalled.\n\n'As well as raising money for charity and being the go to place to find hidden shopping gems, charity shops reduce the impact of throwaway fashion on the planet.\n\n'Buying pre-loved items reduces the amount that goes into landfill as well as avoiding all the environmental costs associated with low cost fast fashion.\n\n'Volunteers play an indispensable role in helping deliver an incredible shopping experience, with over 230,000 people volunteering in charity shops each year.\n\n'In turn, volunteers benefit from a sense of community as well as developing a wide range of skills.'\n\nSpeaking of her decision to bargain hunt, Nina said: 'I can get an outfit that looks just as good for a fiver rather than paying \u00a350, why wouldn't anybody want to do that?'
