He said he\u2019d been playing outdoors recently on school days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen the doctor, Erik Waldman, looked into the boy\u2019s ear and saw a true vision of horror\u2014a brown arachnid burrowing into the epidermal layer of the eardrum and feasting on the child\u2019s blood.\n\nThe hospital captured an image of the tick lodged into the right tympanic membrane, which was published along with a case study on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe tick couldn\u2019t be removed at the doctor\u2019s office, so the boy was moved to an operating room.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCo-author of the report, otolaryngologist David Kasle told CNN that \u201cin any kid, removal of a foreign body from an ear is difficult\u2014but especially in this case,\u201d because the tick\u2019s bloodsucking mouth probe was \u201cdug in,\u201d and pulling out the tick would likely tear the membrane.\n\n\u201cThe eardrum essentially acts as a part of a pretty complex lever mechanism to allow sound to travel from the outer ear into the inner ear and through the middle ear, where there are ossicles\u2014small bones,\u201d Kasle told CNN. \u201cYou need that drum intact to get good sound.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKasle was able to remove the tick\u2019s feeding structure with a fine hook tool. The boy\u2019s eardrum remained intact. Tests a month later revealed the child did not get rashes or fever from the tick.\n\nHowever, the above image of the tick will be embedded in your mind for at least a month.", "description": "Three days after a 9-year-old Connecticut boy started to hear a strange buzzing sound in his ear, his parents took him to a doctor at Yale New Haven Children\u2019s Hospital.", "authors": ["Jennings Brown", "About The Author", "Senior Editor", "Reporter At Gizmodo"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--t9BxWiGl--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/gyxh9epidqtfekpzru1t.png", "published_at": "2019-05-02"}
