But for a lucky few, an education initiative offers a glimpse of a better future\n\nBilly Lafalaise has spent much of his 16 years avoiding the allure of gang life in one of the world\u2019s most notorious slums. He was born in Cit\u00e9 Soleil, the sprawling shantytown of Haiti\u2019s downtrodden and chaotic capital, Port-au-Prince.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to be in a gang here,\u201d Billy says, his mother Jinette nodding in agreement. \u201cAnd every gang is always looking for recruits.\u201d\n\nViolence is a way of life in Cit\u00e9 Soleil, even away from the latest wave of anti-government protests currently engulfing Haiti. On Wednesday, the UN warned of the risk of a full-blown humanitarian crisis as security incidents and roadblocks disrupt aid deliveries.\n\nCars and police stations have been set alight this week as protestors demand the resignation of Haitian president Jovenel Mo\u00efse. In Carbaret, a city just north of Port-au-Prince, they dug a trench about four-feet wide and four-feet deep, on both sides of a bridge, blocking transportation between the capital and Haiti\u2019s second largest city, Cap-Haitien in the north.\n\nIt is not hard to see why. Haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere, with nearly a quarter of its 11 million citizens living below the extreme poverty line of $1.23 a day and 60% living on less than $2 a day. And Cit\u00e9 Soleil is among the hardest hit neighbourhoods.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Children are seen in the shantytown of Cit\u00e9 Soleil.

The stench is unbearable, and this year\u2019s rainy season has been particularly heavy, frequently flooding houses.\n\n\u201cWe are living in a sewer,\u201d said Jerome Racha, one of Billy\u2019s adult neighbours, who attends classes at a nearby educational centre that also accepts parents. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting, but the government won\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d\n\nThe political turmoil across the country has pushed Cit\u00e9 Soleil even further down the rattled government\u2019s list of priorities. A mishandled economy and widespread shortages in food and fuel have brought thousands to the streets to demand the removal of Mo\u00efse, who desperately clings to power.\n\nBut in Cit\u00e9 Soleil, scandal in the presidential palace is irrelevant. \u201cThe money might get allocated here, but it\u2019ll never show up,\u201d Racha said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make a difference what happens with politicians.\u201d\n\nWith virtually no opportunities for work, many children of Billy\u2019s age join gangs \u2013 known as chim\u00e8res \u2013 who run extortion rackets, kidnap for ransom, and fight over territory. The chim\u00e8res descended from paramilitary militias in Cit\u00e9 Soleil who were loyal to Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the populist president who became increasingly authoritarian until being ousted in a 2004 US-backed coup.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An aerial view of Cit\u00e9 Soleil\u2019s sprawling landscape.

When the catastrophic earthquake of 2010 struck Port-au-Prince, bringing the country to its knees and taking tens of thousands of lives, a cholera outbreak swiftly followed \u2013 introduced by UN peacekeepers \u2013 while incarcerated criminals escaped the local prison and slipped back into their old ways in Cit\u00e9 Soleil.\n\nBut there are signs that things are changing. A delicate peace between warring chim\u00e8res has so far stood since April, which was the last time Billy fell asleep to the sound of gunfire.\n\n\u201cThat was around the last time I saw a dead body,\u201d Billy said, adding that he has lost count of the number of corpses he has seen in his life. \u201cThings have calmed down now, but the fighting could start again at any time.\u201d\n\nFor Billy\u2019s mother, it was a blessing that he could go to a school supported by the AVSI Foundation, an Italian NGO working in Haiti since 1999. AVSI receives funding in Haiti for some of its projects, including the school, from the EU.\n\n\u201cA gang life is not a life I wanted for my son,\u201d Jinette Lafalaise said, brushing his shoulder. \u201cSo I support him in whatever else he wants to do.\u201d\n\nHaiti has a complicated history with NGOs. In the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake, many were heavily criticised for poor crisis management, and last year Oxfam became embroiled in scandal when news broke that its workers had been soliciting sexual favours in exchange for aid. But in Cit\u00e9 Soleil, the absence of the government leaves locals with little other recourse.\n\n\u201cWe have to thank those that are here,\u201d said Lafalaise. \u201cWithout them, there wouldn\u2019t be much for our children.\u201d\n\nBilly studies along with 250 others. Though he is at the age students would normally graduate, he has been held back several years due to joining late. Like the vast majority of his neighbours, he does not speak or understand French, which \u2013 until 2013, when it was replaced by Haitian Creole \u2013 was the language of the classroom in Cit\u00e9 Soleil.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cit\u00e9 Soleil is one of the areas hardest hit by the poverty that grips Haiti.

He also raps, performing his own songs for his friends and classmates. He hopes one day to perform abroad.\n\nDanilus Derival is similarly grateful that education is becoming an ever more attractive option for youngsters in the neighbourhood. His daughter, Youventha, recently enrolled at the school and aspires to become a nurse when she graduates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have dreams,\u201d said the elder Derival, seeking shade under a tree. \u201cWe have so many problems here.\u201d\n\nBut most people were not so lucky. Watson Etienne lived his whole life in Cit\u00e9 Soleil, and found himself dropping out of school and running in a gang when a teenager. His brother was killed in a dispute with a rival gang when he was 19 years old.\n\nGhosts of tyrants past stalk proud Haiti as it slides towards the brink Read more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what all my friends were doing so I just fell into it,\u201d Etienne said with a stoic candour. \u201cThings have got much better now because people are starting to get more opportunities, being a chimere isn\u2019t the only thing for young people to do.\u201d\n\nHe also coaches other former gang members on how to leave criminality behind, supported by AVSI. He claims that finding a passion is key, alongside letting go of past grudges.\n\n\u201cAll the people I used to have trouble with, and there\u2019s a lot of them, I would gladly shake hands with them now,\u201d he said. \u201cThat makes me more powerful than any gang leader.\u201d\n\nBut hopes raised and dashed are a familiar pattern to Haitians, whose daily struggles are becoming exacerbated as the political unrest continues.\n\nAs Etienne sat, scanning his currently calm neighbourhood from a second-floor landing of the educational centre, Billy showed up in the courtyard below, rapping for anyone who would listen. \u201cWords, not guns, are the future of Cit\u00e9 Soleil,\u201d Etienne says with determination.", "description": "Cit\u00e9 Soleil is a hotbed for gangs and violence.
