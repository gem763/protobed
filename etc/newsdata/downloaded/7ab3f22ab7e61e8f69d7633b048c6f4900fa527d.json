What was striking, though, was that the reaction came only hours after President DONALD TRUMP proudly announced the death of Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, in a U.S. military raid.\n\nWE\u2019RE NOT SURE what the president expected to happen, but closeups of his face during the crowd\u2019s reaction as name was announced on the stadium PA show a smile hardening into a slight scowl. How will he react today?\n\nIT\u2019S A SIGN OF THE PRESIDENT\u2019S ISOLATION, too, that he took only his staunchest Republican allies with him to the game, along with the first lady. Nats Park is perhaps one of the only gathering places in town that draws Republicans and Democrats in equal measure -- but his box was all red.\n\nTHAT SAID \u2026 He was under no obligation to notify Speaker NANCY PELOSI ahead of the Baghdadi raid, but telling her and other top Democrats would\u2019ve bought a huge chunk of goodwill. Pelosi -- a former top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee -- has been trusted with state secrets for decades. There is approximately zero chance she would\u2019ve dialed up a reporter to leak the plans.\n\nBREAKING \u2026 FT: \u201cBrexit: EU agrees extension as Boris Johnson looks to trigger U.K. election \u2014 latest news\u201d: \u201cEU leaders have agreed to offer the UK an extension on the Brexit deadline from October 31 to the end of January after France gave up on its objections to such an lengthy delay.\u201d FT\n\n-- FROM LONDON PLAYBOOK: \u201cEU ambassadors are meeting in Brussels this morning to agree a draft plan to grant the U.K. another Brexit delay until January 31, 2020, with the option for the U.K. to leave sooner, either at the end of November or the end of December, *if* the Withdrawal Agreement can be ratified in time.\u201d More from London Playbook\n\nHEATHER CAYGLE, JOHN BRESNAHAN and KYLE CHENEY: \u201cRep. Katie Hill to resign amid allegations of inappropriate relationships with staffers\u201d: \u201cFreshman Rep. Katie Hill is resigning from Congress after facing allegations of inappropriate sexual relationships with staffers in her office and on her congressional campaign.\n\n\u201c\u2018It is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress. This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community and our country,\u2019 Hill wrote in a letter announcing the news after it was first reported by POLITICO. \u2026\n\n\u201cSpeaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who has taken a hard line in sexual harassment cases, said in a statement that Hill had made the right decision in stepping down. \u2018[Hill] has acknowledged errors in judgment that made her continued service as a member untenable,\u2019 Pelosi said on Sunday night. \u2018We must ensure a climate of integrity and dignity in the Congress, and in all workplaces.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- L.A. TIMES COLUMNIST ROBIN ABCARIAN: \u201cDemocratic Rep. Katie Hill messed up, but she should not have resigned\u201d: \u201cI really wish U.S. Rep. Katie Hill had not resigned.\n\n\u201cThe Antelope Valley freshman Democrat has been charged with no crime, is going through what appears to be a miserable divorce, has always been frank about her bisexuality, had a relationship with a member of her campaign staff, but has denied an accusation that she had an affair with a male congressional staffer when she got to Washington, D.C., earlier this year. She is now the subject of a House ethics probe.\n\n\u201cShould we have expected more from her? Yes, and I will get to that in a moment. But she has done nothing \u2014 that we know of at least \u2014 that should have led her to step down.\n\n\u201cIf indeed she had a sexual relationship with a staffer in her congressional office, that should have earned a slap on the wrist for the 32-year-old Democrat. To show how seriously Congress takes that sort of thing, it wasn\u2019t even until last year that the House changed its rules to prohibit relationships between members and their employees. For decades, male lawmakers got away with those sort of shenanigans. Wouldn\u2019t you know it, the first one to fall afoul of the rule is a woman, and a bisexual woman, at that.\u201d LAT\n\nA message from PhRMA: FACT: Speaker Pelosi\u2019s drug pricing plan would siphon $1 trillion or more from biopharmaceutical innovators over the next 10 years. CBO\u2019s preliminary estimate found this bill \u201cwould result in lower spending on research and development and thus reduce the introduction of new drugs.\u201d Get the facts.\n\nPOST-GAMING BAGHDADI \u2026\n\n-- WAPO: \u201cDespite Baghdadi raid, some analysts question U.S. ability to prevent ISIS resurgence,\u201d by Karen DeYoung, Louisa Loveluck and Shane Harris: \u201c[T]he raid came amid rising concern that the diminishing U.S. military and civilian footprint, along with cuts in funding for stabilization and reconstruction, undermines that commitment in a part of the world where U.S. leadership is crucial both to American and global security.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- WSJ: \u201cDeath of Baghdadi Unlikely to End the Insurgency He Led,\u201d by Isabel Coles in Erbil, Iraq, Jared Malsin in Istanbul and Warren Strobel: \u201cA hobbled Islamic State might even be reinvigorated rather than demoralized by Baghdadi\u2019s death, says Charlie Winter, a senior fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation.\n\n\u201c\u2018In [the] coming days/weeks/months, it\u2019ll be rushing to secure and consolidate its remnants under whatever new leadership structure emerges,\u2019 said Mr. Winter on Twitter. A senior U.S. official said military pressure must continue on the remnants of Islamic State \u2018otherwise the conditions will be ripe for them to reconstitute,\u2019 as al Qaeda did in Iraq.\u201d WSJ\n\n-- AP\u2019S JONATHAN LEMIRE: \u201cAnalysis: With ISIS death, Trump touts much-needed triumph\u201d: \u201cImperiled by an impeachment inquiry and facing fierce foreign policy criticism from within his own party, Trump reveled in the win Sunday, at first announcing the raid like so many of his predecessors, with solemnity for the mission in Syria and praise for the brave Americans and allies who carried it out.\n\n\u201cAs the minutes passed, he reverted to the president who has tried to redefine the office and how Americans view it, using graphic language and awkward ad-libs while dispensing criticism of his political foes, at home and abroad, and turning the triumph into a moment, more than anything, about Donald J. Trump himself.\n\n\u201cDespite the Trumpian flourishes, the president\u2019s White House reveal of al-Baghdadi\u2019s death gave him a destined-for-history image to place alongside Barack Obama\u2019s iconic announcement of the killing of Osama Bin Laden. It also offered him a reprieve from the escalating impeachment inquiry and a ready-made line for this 2020 reelection campaign.\u201d AP\n\nHAPPENING THIS WEEK: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Senate Democrats will force a floor vote on a resolution to repeal the Trump administration\u2019s 1332 waiver rule, which allows states to offer insurance plans that do not fully protect people with pre-existing conditions and do not cover essential health benefits such as prescription drugs and maternity coverage.\n\nGood Monday morning. THE NATIONALS, ugh, whatever \u2026\n\nYES, TRUMP WAS BOOED, and some fans even chanted \u201cLock him up.\u201d Video \u2026 Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who was in the box with him, told the pool upon return to the White House that Trump said, \u201cGood pitching always beats good hitting.\u201d Game 6, which is do or die for the Nats, is Tuesday night at 8 p.m. in Houston.\n\nSPOTTED in the president\u2019s box at the game: Melania Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Graham, Sen.

A rising senator in the other party is decrying the White House \u2018smear campaign\u2019 against the investigation.\n\n\u201cThe year was 1998 and it was President Bill Clinton who was under siege by an impeachment inquiry, just as President Donald Trump is now. At the time, Chuck Schumer was blasting the impeachment drive while Mitch McConnell called for all sides to stick to the facts.\n\n\u201cIn the intervening 21 years, Schumer and McConnell might as well have swapped talking points. The politics of impeachment have always revolved around hypocrisy and partisanship. These days, it\u2019s just become easier to see. YouTube readily delivers embarrassing evidence of high-profile flip-flops: videos of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) arguing for impeachment in the \u201990s have been a staple of Democratic Twitter accounts for weeks.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- NYT\u2019S NICK FANDOS and MIKE SCHMIDT: \u201cMoving Closer to Trump, Impeachment Inquiry Faces Critical Test\u201d: \u201cHouse impeachment investigators are speeding toward new White House barriers meant to block crucial testimony and evidence from the people who are closest to President Trump \u2014 obstacles that could soon test the limits of Democrats\u2019 fact finding a month into their inquiry.\n\n\u201cWhat has been a rapidly moving investigation securing damning testimony from witnesses who have defied White House orders may soon become a more arduous effort. Investigators are now trying to secure cooperation from higher-ranking advisers who can offer more direct accounts of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions but are also more easily shielded from Congress.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are likely to face the first such roadblock on Monday, when one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest advisers is expected to defy a subpoena as he awaits a federal court to determine whether he can speak with impeachment investigators. But others could soon follow, legal experts and lawmakers say, forcing Democratic leaders toward a consequential choice: Try to force cooperation through the courts or move on to begin making an argument for impeachment in public.\u201d NYT\n\n-- \u201cTrump impeachment witnesses leave a trail of tantalizing clues,\u201d by Nahal Toosi: \u201cThey showed up, offered prepared remarks and answered hours of questions to lay out their side of the Ukraine-related impeachment inquiry now engulfing President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cBut the current and former U.S. officials \u2026 also left a trail of clues for investigators to follow. The breadcrumbs \u2014 word of a cable here, mention of a meeting there \u2014 are scattered across what\u2019s been made public from the testimonies.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- NOT HAPPENING TODAY: Former John Bolton deputy Charles Kupperman was due to testify this morning. But on Friday evening, he filed a lawsuit asking a federal court to rule on which to obey: a congressional subpoena or White House orders that he not give a deposition. As of Sunday night, per CBS, his lawyer said he wouldn\u2019t testify today.\n\nA message from PhRMA: FACT: Speaker Pelosi\u2019s drug pricing plan would siphon $1 trillion or more from biopharmaceutical innovators over the next 10 years.

Except There Was No Live Audio,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Helene Cooper, Julian Barnes and Thomas Gibbons-Neff: \u201cIn describing the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Sunday, President Trump used dramatic, even cinematic language to portray the daring American commando raid that brought down the Islamic State leader who, the president said, died \u2018screaming, crying and whimpering.\u2019\n\n\u201cMr. Trump described the video footage he watched from the White House Situation Room as \u2018something really amazing to see.\u2019 The experience, the president said, was \u2018as though you were watching a movie.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat the president saw, according to military and intelligence officials, was overhead surveillance footage on several video screens that, together, provided various angles from above, and in real time. \u2026 [T]hose surveillance feeds could not show what was happening in an underground tunnel, much less detect if Mr. al-Baghdadi was whimpering or crying.\u201d NYT\n\nA message from PhRMA: Speaker Pelosi\u2019s plan is the wrong approach for patients, the U.S. health care system and American innovation.
