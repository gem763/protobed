They knew what to exploit. One indictment involving the so-called Project Lakhta cited a co-conspirator explaining they were to \u201caggravate the conflict between the minorities and the rest of the population.\u201d\n\nThey fed white supremacy to a white audience already on a grievance binge. They pretended to be an American Muslim organization. They amplified reactionary sentiments involving immigration, gun rights, and veterans, demonstrating how well they understood the fulcrums on which American politics precariously balanced. Years before Trump\u2019s impeachment, they threatened civil war in the event of his removal from office.\n\nSt. Petersburg-based troll farm the Internet Research Agency also understood the power of social media platforms with a depth that eluded their ownership. Facebook initially dismissed the impact of the trolling, only to admit by November 2017 that 150 million Americans were exposed to it across Facebook and Instagram. It spurred a seismic backlash to the obscenely wealthy companies. Once adored, now they were summoned to Capitol Hill to answer for their role in hollowing out democracy. And while the efficacy of the Russian propaganda initiative might never be precisely quantified, broadcasting propaganda across Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s empire cost the Internet Research Agency only $46,000.\n\nEven when they used broken English, they were fluent in Internet. One imposter account on Twitter, @ten_gop, interacted with Donald Trump Jr., Michael Flynn, and Fox News. What started on the internet did not stay there. As The Daily Beast first reported, they used Facebook to organize real Americans into attending rallies in 17 cities. Some, in Florida and Pennsylvania, were explicitly pro-Trump. Trolls also pretended to be civil-rights activists to get Americans protesting police violence.\n\nLast year, then-special prosecutor Robert Mueller indicted 13 people for their involvement in the propaganda effort.\n\nFollowing the release of the documents, the committee\u2019s vice chairman Mark Warner (D-VA) added that their findings also suggest the Kremlin has not ceased its propaganda efforts. \u201cI cannot stress this enough: the Committee found that Russia\u2019s efforts continue to this day,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIn fact, we found that this activity increased, rather than decreased, after Election Day 2016.\u201d\n\nWhile senators offered cautious praise for the FBI\u2019s efforts at tackling foreign influence in the years since the election, the committee called it \u201ctroubling\u201d that the FBI monitored Russian social media influence campaigns \u201cmostly through contractors\u201d during the 2016 campaign. The contractor the FBI used sampled just one \u201covertly pro-Russian network of 13 Twitter accounts and their followers\u201d and the Bureau never communicated any of the underlying analysis to Twitter.\n\nThe subject of Russian meddling in elections after 2016 is still apparently a sensitive subject as broad sections of the report\u2019s discussion of \u201congoing IRA activities\u201d were redacted.\n\nGoing forward, the intelligence committee wrote that foreign propagandists could exploit new technologies to once again catch the intelligence committee off guard as Russia did with its use of social media in the 2016 election. In particular, senators expressed concern that the use of \u201cdeepfake\u201d video technology will create \u201cmore realistic and convincing propaganda material\u201d and \u201cadvanced micro-targeting\u201d which could allow foreign propagandists to more effectively target audiences within the U.S.", "description": "\u201cBy far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016,\u201d the panel concluded.", "authors": ["Spencer Ackerman", "Adam Rawnsley", "Senior Nat L Security Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2694,w_4790,x_0,y_196/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570555745/RTS1OHIT_scuwvf", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
