A first estimate of gross domestic product will be released by Eurostat on Oct. 31.\n\nThe euro zone economy grew by a mere 0.2% in the second quarter after expanding 0.4% in the first three months of the year. Growth could slow further in the third quarter, amid a manufacturing crisis in Germany, the bloc's largest economy.\n\nThe IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), an indicator of economic sentiment, recorded in September the worst reading for Germany since 2009, when the global financial crisis plunged the country's economy into recession.\n\nBut on a more positive note, Eurostat's estimates showed on Monday a growing appetite for investment among factory managers. Production of capital goods, such as machinery, went up 1.2% on the month in August, after a 2.1% rise in July, pointing to an expansion of capacity.\n\nOutput also rose for intermediate goods, but dropped for durable and non-durable consumer products, in a sign that manufacturers may be expecting at least a short-term slowdown in sales.", "description": "Euro zone industrial output rebounds with capital goods boost", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9D0OL_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
