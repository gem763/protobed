Fortunately, what most of us refer to as \u201cscars,\u201d according to Julia Tzu, founder and medical director of Wall Street Dermatology, are actually marks caused by post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (brown spots) or post-inflammatory erythema (red spots) that will fade over several months or years. Also fortunately, there are products that can speed up the process.\n\nWe spoke with Tzu, Avram, and seven more dermatologists to get their recommendations for treating, preventing, and camouflaging acne marks.\n\nBest overall product for acne scars\n\nBest hydroquinone products for acne scars\n\nAmbi Skincare Fade Cream According to several of the derms we spoke with, skin-lightening agent hydroquinone is one of the most effective ingredients for fading acne scars. Naissan Wesley, a dermatologist at Skin Care and Laser Physicians of Beverly Hills, explains that hydroquinone \u201ccan help acne marks fade faster by inhibiting the melanocytes [pigment-producing cells in the skin] from making more pigment.\u201d Ambi Fade Cream includes 2 percent hydroquinone, the highest concentration allowed without a prescription. \u201cIt also contains soy, which is well known for treating pigmentation issues, and vitamin E, which helps with scarring,\u201d says Tzu. While the FDA considers hydroquinone safe, it is banned in Europe and can potentially cause irritation or further discoloration, so remember to patch-test and ask a dermatologist whether it\u2019s right for you. $5 at Amazon Buy $5 at Amazon Buy\n\nMurad Environmental Shield Age Spot and Pigment Lightening Serum Although it\u2019s a lot more expensive than the Ambi cream, this serum, recommended by dermatologist Y. Claire Chang of Union Square Laser Dermatology, pairs hydroquinone with vitamin C and glycolic acid, two more proven mark-fighting ingredients. \u201cGlycolic acid helps improve existing brown spots by increasing skin-cell turnover and chemically exfoliating the skin,\u201d she says. \u201c[And] vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that can brighten the skin.\u201d Writer Or Gotham is also a fan of the Murad serum and told us he saw \u201ca visible reduction in dark spots\u201d after only three days of using it. $72 at Sephora Buy\n\nBest hydroquinone-free products for acne scars\n\nThe Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% If you\u2019d rather not use hydroquinone, there are other options for treating acne scars. One of these is azelaic acid, which Dr. Michele Farber of Schweiger Dermatology says works by inhibiting the formation of an enzyme called tyrosinase, which in turn stops the mechanism that produces skin-darkening melanin. Moulton-Levy recommends this affordable and effective azelaic acid treatment from the Ordinary. $8 at Sephora Buy\n\nSkinCeuticals C + AHA Like the Murad serum, this treatment combines vitamin C with glycolic acid (and lactic acid, another exfoliant) to fade marks but without the hydroquinone. Nagler recommends vitamin C because it\u2019s \u201can adjunct in preventing free-radical damage, which helps with pigmentation,\u201d and he says the most effective formulas \u2014 like this one \u2014 are often more expensive because vitamin C is a difficult ingredient to stabilize. $136 at Dermstore Buy\n\nTHE ORDINARY Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution On the cheaper end, Moulton-Levy says this strong glycolic-acid toner is another good option for fading acne marks. $9 at SkinStore Buy $9 at Sephora Buy\n\nBest cleanser for acne scars\n\nSkinCeuticals Purifying Cleanser In addition to sun protection and targeted treatments, the right cleanser can help minimize acne marks. A favorite of both Moulton-Levy and Chang, this cleanser encourages cell turnover without drying out the skin. Chang says it \u201ccontains glycolic acid to wash away dead skin cells on the top layer of the skin, leaving a very clean feel and improving acne blemishing.\u201d $35 at Dermstore Buy\n\nBest products for preventing acne scars\n\nNeutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash When it comes to acne scars \u2014 the especially-difficult-to-treat indented or raised ones \u2014 the best offense is a good defense. If you\u2019re still struggling with active acne and want to avoid future scarring, Avram likes this drugstore-staple Neutrogena cleanser because it contains salicylic acid, which \u201cexfoliates the skin, softens the appearance of the acne itself, and has some antibacterial properties.\u201d Chang agrees that the cleanser \u201ccan help unclog pores, treat comedones [whiteheads] and blackheads, and prevent active acne.\u201d $6 at Amazon Buy $10 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nPeter Thomas Roth Max Complexion Correction Pads If you\u2019re looking to treat both your current pimples and existing scars, these exfoliating pads, recommended by Chang, contain ingredients that help with both. \u201cSalicylic acid increases skin-cell turnover and de-clogs pores to reduce blackheads,\u201d she says. \u201cGlycolic acid chemically exfoliates the skin to even skin tone and decrease blemishing.\u201d Often seen in acne treatments, salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid that prevents and treats acne, which ultimately means fewer marks and scars. $46 at Sephora Buy\n\nDifferin Acne Treatment $21 (was $25, now 16% off) A prescription-strength retinoid that became available over the counter a few years back, Differin affects cell turnover faster than OTC retinol to prevent the formation of new acne but is still, according to Engelman, \u201cgentler compared to other retinoids.\u201d Avram recommends it for those dealing with a lot of small pimples and only the occasional monster cyst. Because Nagler says retinoids \u201cencourage collagen remodeling,\u201d a well-tolerated formula like Differin can reduce the appearance of deeper scars. Moulton-Levy likes it as well for lightening existing marks. $21 for 2 at Amazon Buy $21 for 2 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
