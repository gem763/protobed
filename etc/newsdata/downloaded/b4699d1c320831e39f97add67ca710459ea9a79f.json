Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was included in the original request, as were a number of his top deputies, indicating a widespread belief among Trump\u2019s detractors that American foreign policy has been hijacked by political operatives \u2014 and political considerations.\n\nFrom left, Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Pompeo.

The group filed a Freedom of Information Act request when it noticed news reports that the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, had been recalled. American Oversight filed a lawsuit in October, after the State Department failed to turn over the documents.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo News after Wednesday\u2019s decision, American Oversight executive director Austin Evers called the ruling \u201ca crack in the administration\u2019s stone wall.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last month in New York.

On background, staffers for American Oversight agreed with the assessment that the order left little room for the Trump administration to maneuver.\n\nNeither the State Department nor the Department of Justice replied to a request for comment.\n\nJoshua Geltzer, a constitutional law scholar at Georgetown University, told Yahoo News that the directive was \u201ca big deal in its significance but also appears to reflect a clear application of settled law,\u201d since Freedom of Information requests \u201caren\u2019t supposed to be handled so slowly as to make them irrelevant.\u201d Geltzer, who served on the National Security Council during the Obama administration, added that \u201cwhatever weird role President Trump assigned to Rudy Giuliani, he\u2019s not a government employee \u2014 so it\u2019s really hard for the government to claim that the communications with him are subject to various privileges.\u201d\n\nAt the time that Yovanovitch was suddenly recalled, Giuliani and others \u2014 including Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union \u2014 were attempting to pressure Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to launch an investigation into the business affairs of Hunter Biden, son of Trump\u2019s potential 2020 rival Joe Biden. The younger Biden sat on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company accused of corrupt practices. He no longer has ties to Burisma, but Trump and his allies have resurrected questions about his involvement.\n\nTrump\u2019s attempts to exert pressure on Zelensky became public when an anonymous whistleblower complaint became public in late September. That complaint, which strongly indicates that Trump attempted to enter into an improper quid pro quo arrangement with Zelensky, has served as the basis of an impeachment inquiry launched by congressional Democrats.", "description": "In what could prove a highly consequential ruling, a federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to start turning over documents regarding potentially improper influence on Ukraine diplomacy.", "authors": ["Alexander Nazaryan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pKll_t8FT4ryfrDnqCo.LA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/9e237820-f5d3-11e9-9efb-47617ab45259", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
