Finding and cultivating the right technology talent can lead a company to look beyond their own IT teams, and a lack of clarity around what the shift means for a company can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nLuigi Mercone, managing director at Bank of New York Mellon Corp., warned against wishful thinking regarding the capabilities of the cloud or any other technology.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of chasing the shiny object,\u201d he said during the panel discussion, hosted by enterprise-technology venture-capital fund Work-Bench.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nBusiness executives\u2019 unrealistic expectations of the cloud can contribute to unnecessary strain for technologists, said Bill Murphy, chief technology officer at private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP.\n\n\u201cThey hear \u2019cloud,\u2019 they hear Amazon is going to run it for one penny a terabyte or whatever the hell it is today and can we have that by next quarter,\u201d he said.\n\nBy moving to the cloud, companies are outsourcing their computing needs. Cloud infrastructure services such as Amazon.com Inc. \u2019s Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp. \u2019s Azure use their own data centers to provide companies with the raw computing components that have traditionally been run in-house.\n\nInformation-technology departments need to resist the pressure to chalk up short-term gains and convince the business that moving to the cloud is a journey, not flipping a switch, Mr. Murphy said.\n\n\u201cYou need to convince them to overinvest for a period of time,\u201d he said.\n\nPeople issues related to cloud adoption also can affect the IT team itself, starting with finding talent. Identifying cloud-capable talent inside and outside the organization can be challenging.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise to anyone that hiring in technology is really hard right now,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.\n\nIn addition, IT personnel will need to adopt a different culture and get on board with new processes associated with the cloud.\n\n\u201cHow do you wrap your head around it and get your own people to actually change?\u201d asked panelist Alla Whitson, chief technology officer at lender CIT Group Inc. \u201cI think the challenge is for the organization to commit to it, to really, really commit to it and actually drive it through.\u201d\n\nBanks have been slower to shift to the cloud, remaining particularly cautious when it comes to moving consumer data. The recent Capital One Corp. hack, which exposed information about roughly 106 million past, present and prospective customers that was stored on Amazon Web Services, illustrates some of their reasons for hesitation.\n\nSecurity is the top obstacle to cloud adoption, Mr. Mercone said. Securing numerous devices is difficult but important. \u201cBetter be able to map your endpoints,\u201d he said.\n\nBy 2023, banks are forecast to spend more than $53 billion on public cloud infrastructure and data services, up from $24.3 billion this year, according to market-research firm International Data Corp.\n\nAside from security concerns, the decision of whether or not to adopt cloud processes could be determined by more pragmatic considerations, panel participants said.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t primarily one of infrastructure, Ms. Whitson said. Rather, it is often about applications. Some legacy applications run just fine as they are. Companies should start by defining the business problem and take it from there, she advised.\n\nIn many cases, buying technology is the best decision. Companies should build technology in-house only when it offers capabilities that cloud services can\u2019t, Ms. Whitson said.\n\nThe panelists said that startups have a role to play in their IT strategies, something the roomful of attendees, many from New York\u2019s enterprise startup scene, were pleased to hear.\n\nBNY Mellon\u2019s Mr. Mercone had some words of advice for startups seeking enterprise customers: \u201cThis isn\u2019t Tinder, this isn\u2019t speed dating. Selling into the enterprise is easily a 12-to-18-month sustained campaign.\u201d\n\nWrite to Thomas Loftus at thomas.loftus@wsj.com.", "description": "People issues can hinder a company\u2019s move to the cloud just as much as technological hurdles, three finance and asset-management technologists said at an industry event", "authors": ["Thomas Loftus"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109029/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
