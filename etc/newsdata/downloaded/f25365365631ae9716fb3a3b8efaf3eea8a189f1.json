They point out that the weapon, along with similar rifles made by Colt's competitors, has been used frequently in mass shootings.\n\nRobert Spitzer, a political science professor at SUNY Cortland who writes frequently on guns, tells Connecticut Public Radio that although AR-15s \"represent a small percentage of guns in America,\" they have come to occupy an outsized place in the gun-control debate.\n\n\"Politically speaking, these weapons have come to be seen as sort of at the core of America's gun problem,\" he said.\n\nIn his statement, however, Veilleux insisted that the West Hartford, Conn., based gun maker \"is committed to the Second Amendment, highly values its customers and continues to manufacture the world's finest quality firearms for the consumer market.\"\n\nAdam Winkler, a gun policy expert at the UCLA School of Law, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying the company needs to tread lightly to keep from antagonizing its customers.\n\n\"We've seen in the past that when gun manufacturers are viewed to have given in to gun-safety advocates, gun owners will boycott them and really hurt their business,\" he said. \"If they think a company like Colt is disrespecting their identity or giving in to the other side, Colt's likely going to see serious damage to its other firearms brands too.\"\n\nVeilleux said the decision to halt manufacture of the AR-15 for the civilian market came because \"high-volume contracts\" from the military and law enforcement were \"absorbing all of Colt's manufacturing capacity for rifles.\"\n\nHours after the statement was released, the Department of Defense announced that it had awarded Colt a $41.9 million contract to manufacture rifles for sales to militaries in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, Oceania and the Caribbean.\n\nThe company's origins date to an 1836 patent granted to Samuel Colt for his firearm design. Colt has long been a key supplier to the U.S. military, but in 2013 lost its contract with the government to supply the successor to the M16, the M4 carbine, due to reliability issues. Soldiers reportedly complained that the M4 was prone to malfunction in the dusty environments encountered in the field in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nThe contract was instead awarded to a Belgian firearms manufacturer and in 2015, Colt Defense filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.", "description": "The gun maker says it will concentrate instead on fulfilling contracts from the military and law enforcement for the semi-automatic weapon that has come for many to be associated with mass shootings,", "authors": ["Scott Neuman"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/20/ap_19262633825178_wide-30be0e3f5fdd66f4a65c5d9ea9101ba774781c86.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
