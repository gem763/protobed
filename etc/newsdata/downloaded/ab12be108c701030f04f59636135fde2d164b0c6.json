Maybe David De Gea but no-one else and he\u2019s injured for this one.\n\nGordon McQueen (left) is tackled by Mark Lawrenson during the League Cup final in 1983\n\nIt\u2019s a huge gap between the two clubs. You only have to look at the points difference after eight or games of the season to see that.\n\nIn those days, the dominance of either club didn\u2019t matter, but it does now because Liverpool are so much better.\n\nDominance didn\u2019t matter then because we always felt we could get one over on Liverpool. In the 12 or 13 times I played against Liverpool, Ian Rush never scored against me.\n\nThe games against them were always very tight and you always looked forward to it as the biggest game in the football calendar \u2014 never mind Manchester City. It will be another huge game on Sunday.\n\nThis is the biggest match in the world, you dare not lose\n\nPHIL THOMPSON (LIVERPOOL - 477 games, 1971-85)\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter one bit whether Liverpool or Manchester United are the more dominant going into this game. What matters most is that the players understand this is the biggest game in world football and they dare not lose.\n\nMy fear is that some of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s players will produce their best performance of the season and their fans will be asking \u2018Where\u2019s that been?\u2019 That\u2019s why Jordan Henderson and James Milner will be the most important players in Liverpool\u2019s dressing room. Not Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane or Virgil van Dijk because Henderson and Milner will underline what this game means.\n\nLiverpool's Phil Thompson challenges Joe Jordan during the FA Cup semi-final in 1979\n\nWhen United were dominant, Gary Neville would have been one of the first to go round the dressing room and kick-start the mind games with his teammates.\n\nI made my debut at Old Trafford against George Best, Bobby Charlton and Denis Law and was shaking in awe at what I was going to face, but Bill Shankly gave us such belief that we won 3-0.\n\nI can remember Roy Evans\u2019s sides outplaying United but still losing. Ole is saying this can open the door to United\u2019s season and he\u2019s absolutely right. You can revel in being the the underdog for this fixture and Liverpool, as the favourite, have to be switched on.\n\nOf course, yours truly has a pretty decent record in this game. Managing against Sir Alex Ferguson, we played two, won two. You just daren\u2019t lose this game.\n\nLiverpool was the only home game Fergie made us stay in a hotel\n\nGARY PALLISTER (MANCHESTER UNITED - 437 GAMES , 1989-98)\n\nWe were dominant at the time but I will never forget the 3-3 draw at Anfield in 1994. At 3-0 up at half-time, we thought it was going to be a result to change the face of the fixture. It could have been five or six but Liverpool came back at us with verve.\n\nSo which one of us was the dominant club didn\u2019t really count. When I arrived at United they actually had a decent record against Liverpool despite them being stronger. We held our own against them and that says a lot about the fixture.\n\nIt\u2019s the most passionate and crazy of Premier League games. It means so much to the fans and it\u2019s still the biggest one in the calendar because of the dominance of both clubs over the years \u2014 vying for bragging rights over who is most successful.\n\nThere was always a different feel to the game and a different preparation. It was the only time the manager took us away to a hotel before a home fixture.\n\nWe knew how big it was but he wanted us to know how significant it was to break the stranglehold they had. There was more pressure. You get caught up in the whole feel of it. You know what it means to the fans and the club is an awful place to be around when you lose that one.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if United win this one and then lose at Norwich next week\n\nCLAYTON BLACKMORE (MANCHESTER UNITED - 245 GAMES, 1982-94)\n\nThe weird thing is, when Liverpool were winning the league all the time we used to beat them and when we were winning the league all the time they used to beat us. I don\u2019t know why, it\u2019s a hard one to explain!\n\nUnited-Liverpool is always the standout fixture but I\u2019d give up winning the game to win the league.\n\nThe only goal I ever scored at Wembley was against Liverpool in the 1990 Charity Shield, but John Barnes equalised and we ended up sharing it \u2014 no penalty shootouts back then! Liverpool were the big team on the block at the time and they\u2019re the best team around at the moment.\n\nThey will come at United tomorrow and that will leave more space for us.\n\nUnited don\u2019t do so well against teams that drop off because we struggle to break them down.\n\nUnited have also got injuries to key players. Missing Paul Pogba in midfield is a big problem but Sergio Romero is a good reserve to come in for \u2019keeper David de Gea.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if United win this one and then lose at Norwich the following week after playing a tricky away game in Belgrade against Partizan.\n\nIt didn't matter how bad United were, we had to beat them!\n\nRONNIE WHELAN (LIVERPOOL - 493 games, 1979-94)\n\nWhether Manchester United were tenth or second, it didn\u2019t matter. We only ever had one thing in our mind \u2014 beat them, keep them at arm\u2019s length.\n\nWe had a fantastic time in the 1980s and we dominated the league but never once did we take games against them for granted.\n\nManchester United's Paul Ince is blocked by Ronnie Whelan at Wembley in 1990\n\nThey had difficulties with consistency but they always had fantastic individuals, such as Bryan Robson, who had the potential to do damage. So when the fixtures came around, it was simply a case of getting three points and keeping them out of the way.\n\nI always remember going to Old Trafford and you could feel the venom and hatred in the atmosphere. You knew how desperate they were to flatten us and if that didn\u2019t give you an extra incentive to win, nothing would. The tension you felt beforehand couldn\u2019t be compared. That\u2019s what made the emotions around the results so acute. If you lost, the thought of going into work on Monday was awful. You could get over most defeats but not to them. But beating them? There\u2019s nothing like it.\n\nDid I ever think they would overhaul us? No. I remember 1985-86 when they started with 10 wins from 10 and everyone was a cock-a-hoop. We were never worried. The feeling was \u2018we\u2019ll be OK when we get going\u2019. We were. We won the Double.\n\nThey were poor at Newcastle... so I'm expecting a reaction\n\nANDY ROBERTSON (LIVERPOOL - 90 games, 2017 -)\n\nI don\u2019t think it matters what your form is like for these games. It doesn\u2019t matter that we\u2019ve won eight on the bounce and they\u2019re struggling. It\u2019s Manchster United versus Liverpool.\n\nI have no doubt they will produce a reaction after a poor performance against Newcastle. They will be firing and wanting to kick-start their season. There would be no better time to do it than against us. But we have our own objectives and our own aims. That\u2019s what we are striving for.\n\nWhat makes the game so special is that it\u2019s historic. There have been so many great battles down the years between top teams who have always fought for everything on the pitch. It\u2019s genuinely a different atmosphere \u2014 but a good one. There is always an edge to it.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice, historic stadium, although I prefer Anfield!", "description": "Manchester United are 15 points behind Liverpool.
