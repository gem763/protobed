Reuters photographer Mohammad Ponir Hossain was taking pictures of exhausted refugees on the beach when he heard an autorickshaw driver shouting that a boat had capsized. \"I rushed to the spot and found people crying over the dead body of a child,\" Ponir said.\n\nHe took a picture of Hamida, cradling the tiny pale body of her child, Abdul Masood. He appears to have died as the survivors scrambled through the crashing waves to shore. Another picture showed the anguish on the face of Nasir Ahmed as he carried his son away from the crowd.\n\nThe couple\u2019s other son survived the accident. Around 400,000 Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh in less than three weeks and people are still arriving, by land and sea, after attacks by Rohingya militants sparked a fierce counteroffensive by Myanmar's army.
