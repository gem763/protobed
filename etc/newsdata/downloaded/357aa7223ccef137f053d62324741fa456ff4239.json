Not only has Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the classic DC villain been revered by critics and audiences alike, but the movie has enjoyed record-breaking box office success.\n\nIn the midst of the hype, Joker's cinematographer Lawrence Sher has gone right ahead and confirmed one of the film's greatest mysteries.\n\nPhoto credit: Warner Bros. More\n\nSee, the thriller ended with Phoenix's Arthur Fleck facing a dismal future in what appears to be Arkham Asylum.\n\nAnd before the curtains close, fans were left wondering whether the character had made up the entire runtime of events in his head.\n\nOne of the key catalysts for this theory being the realisation that Arthur's relationship with Zazie Beetz's Sophie is little more than a made-up romance built off the back of a single meeting in an elevator.\n\nPhoto credit: Warner Bros. More\n\nA scene in the film sees the Clown Prince of Crime leaving Sophie's apartment to return home, where he laughs in pain as police sirens can be heard outside.\n\nIt's this turn of events that has led many to debate whether or not he killed his fictitious lover or this was just another of his delusions.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with /Film , Sher put the debate to bed \u2013 turns out, it was the latter.\n\n\"We wanted to make the interpretation of the real versus what's not real, a part of the viewer's experience,\" he explained.\n\n\n\n\"For instance, his relationship to Sophie is a fantasy to him. Some people have asked me, 'Was she killed?' [Director Todd Phillips] makes it clear she wasn't killed.\n\n\"Arthur is killing people who've wronged him in a certain way, and Sophie never wronged him. In terms of what we did visually to play with the real and not real, there are callbacks and scenes that mirror each other.\n\nPhoto credit: Niko Tavernise - Warner Bros. More\n\n\"We leave hints using imagery or way we covered scenes similarly between scene. Outside of that, I like that people can have the conversation and come to their own conclusions.\"\n\nSo that settles it. As for the other dozens of unsettled theories surrounding the film, those are still very much open to interpretation.\n\nJoker is in cinemas now.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "We have an answer.", "authors": ["Daisy Phillipson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YLVK.zgdnnNT7DxLAK06Xg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/esquire_253/a50af0c4e167f4ef2e7adf6f7b063ba2", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
