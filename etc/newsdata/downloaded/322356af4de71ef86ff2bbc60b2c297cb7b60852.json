The claim relates to calls that took place in July and August, and the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community Michael Atkinson alerted House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff about the complaint on Sept. 9.\n\nTrump tweeted Tuesday that he\u2019ll release a full transcript of the \u201cvery friendly and totally appropriate call\u201d with Zelensky, but with Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire scheduled to testify publicly before the committee on Thursday, Congress is still demanding the details on the whistle-blower\u2019s report \u2014 with a resolution having passed unanimously in Senate calling for it to be released to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.\n\nWhile the whistle-blower\u2019s identity is still not publicly known, he or she has been praised in the court of public opinion. Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe hailed the decision to bring the complaint as an act of \u201cincredible courage.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s history with whistle-blowers is as old as the country itself, but the popular idea that they are courageous hasn\u2019t meant whistle-blowing isn\u2019t still risky, says Tom Mueller, author of Crisis of Conscience: Whistleblowing in an Age of Fraud, out Oct. 1. And in the intelligence community, where sharing secrets is a loaded idea, whistle-blowing is even more complicated.\n\nThe origins of the term \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d are murky \u2014 one theory holds that it\u2019s a reference to the whistle blown by British policemen when they saw foul play, and another says it\u2019s a sports reference to the whistles blown by referees \u2014 but the principle dates back to medieval England by way of Roman law. Central to the existence of whistle-blowers is the concept that sometimes individuals, not governments or law-enforcement, need to be the ones who raise the alarm about wrongdoing.\n\nAt a time when there was no national police force, people who noticed transgressions could report them to the King\u2019s representatives, under what was known as the qui tam provision. (That name comes from the phrase Qui tam pro domino rege quam pro se ipso in hac parte sequitur, meaning \u201cHe who sues on behalf of our Lord the King and on his own behalf.\u201d) To incentivize this kind of whistle-blowing, and in recognition of the negative social consequences that might come with it, the government made it a lucrative proposition: if a conviction followed, the person who did the reporting got some of the bounty. The earliest known example of the application of qui tam is King Wihtred of Kent\u2019s 695 declaration: \u201cIf a freeman works during the forbidden time [i.e., the Sabbath], he shall forfeit his healsfang [i.e., pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment], and the man who informs against him shall have half the fine, and [the profits arising from] the labor.\u201d\n\nThese English provisions about whistle-blowing carried over to the British colonies in North America. The federal government, even in its early stages, recognized whistle-blowing and the need to alert Congress as soon as possible about wrongdoings by people working with or for the government. On March 25, 1777, Marine captain John Grannis told the Continental Congress that he and nine other sailors saw the commander-in-chief of the continental navy, Esek Hopkins, treating British prisoners inhumanely aboard the USS Warren, and that the commander would refer to Congress as \u201ca pack of damned fools.\u201d On July 30, 1778, legislation was passed declaring that anyone who served the U.S. had the duty to tell Congress as soon as possible about any \u201cmisconduct, frauds or misdemeanors\u201d committed by others in government service.\n\nBut the major case that shaped American whistle-blower law came during the Civil War. The rush to outfit the troops for war led to shortages of horses, wool and gunpowder \u2014 and a rush for companies to make money by selling shoddy goods to the needy Union Army. New York Congressman and abolitionist Charles H. Van Wyck questioned hundreds of witnesses to such fraud, putting together a report that led to the 1863 passage of the False Claims Act. The law established fines for contractors who cheated that system, and said that a whistle-blower who started a False Claims suit \u2014 the person this law termed \u201ca relator\u201d \u2014 would get 50% of the money if the case was successful.", "description": "\"It's freedom of speech.
