Pat also applauds his efforts to fight Christian persecution throughout the world and at home. An added plus for Pat is that Trump is presiding over a strong economy, though my friend fears long-term negative economic impact from out-of-control federal spending.\n\nOn the flip side, and as a regular churchgoer, Pat finds Trump\u2019s personal behavior abhorrent, especially after Trump used the \u201cGD word\u201d at an August rally. Pat\u2019s disgust was mirrored throughout this voting bloc, warranting a Politico piece headlined: \u201c\u2018Using the Lord\u2019s name in vain\u2019: Evangelicals chafe at Trump\u2019s blasphemy.\u201d\n\nOver time, my friend has grown to believe that both nationally and internationally, Trump has demeaned the office of the president. On several occasions Pat had said to me, \u201cTrump is an ass\u201d and wished that \u201cTrump would step down so Pence could take over\u201d \u2014 all BEFORE this impeachment business blew up the headlines.", "description": "", "authors": ["Myra Adams", "Realclearpolitics.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
