Single market Northern Ireland would leave the Customs' Union with the rest of the UK but stay in the single market. This would constitute an 'all island regulatory zone' that covers trade of all goods. It would mean no checks between the two nations, because Northern Ireland would still have to follow EU rules. Goods from Britain to Northern Ireland would effectively be managed by a border in the Irish Sea, with checks only in that direction, not the reverse. Stormont Lock The 'all island regulatory zone' will have to be approved by the people of Northern Ireland. This means the Northern Ireland Assembly has the right to veto the zone and could hold a referendum on the matter. Customs checks Customs checks would have to be put in place on trade between Northern and the Republic of Ireland. Most checks would be made using technology, but some would still have to be physical. Cash for Northern Ireland A promise of a 'new deal for Northern Ireland' means ministers putting money aside for Belfast and Dublin to help aide economic development and ensure new measures work. Keeping to the Good Friday agreement Freedom of movement between two countries will remain. New deal would confirm commitment to collobaration between UK and Ireland.\n\nBut Mr Johnson retorted that meant a deal was 'essentially impossible, not just now but ever'.\n\nMr Johnson is adamant that Northern Ireland must leave the customs union at the same time as the rest of the UK.\n\nThe phone call represents a potentially major moment in the Brexit process and appears to make a No Deal divorce more likely.\n\nIt also raises the prospect of the Tories changing tack in the near future by adopting a position ahead of a potential snap general election of backing a No Deal split as the Conservative Party's preferred option.\n\nA Downing Street source said the call with Ms Merkel - which effectively reads the last rites on hopes for an agreement before a crunch EU summit next week - was a 'clarifying moment'.\n\n'If this represents a new established position then it means a deal is essentially impossible not just now but ever,' the No10 source said.\n\n'It also made clear that they are willing to torpedo the Good Friday Agreement.'\n\nMr Johnson met his Cabinet for crisis talks after the conversation this morning.\n\nMr Tusk, the president of the European Council, then tweeted: 'Boris Johnson, what\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.\n\n'At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis?'\n\nDowning Street had already painted a grim picture of the consequences of rejecting the UK's 'fair and reasonable' blueprint which Mr Johnson submitted to the bloc last week.\n\nOne source explosively claimed the government will make clear that any EU country supporting a delay to the October 31 Brexit deadline would be engaging in 'hostile interference' in British politics.\n\nAny hope of cooperation will be 'in the toilet' and the Tories will end all negotiations to fight an election, switching to a policy of leaving the EU immediately without an agreement.\n\nThe Tories will win because Parliament and Remainer MPs are 'as popular as the Clap', the source claimed.\n\n'They think now that if there is another delay we will keep coming back with new proposals,' the source told the Spectator.\n\n'This won't happen. We'll either leave with No Deal on 31 October or there will be an election and then we will leave with No Deal.'", "description": "Michael Gove today ramped up the government's preparations for a No Deal Brexit as the chances of an agreement being struck between Britain and the EU appeared to collapse.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/12/19440662-0-image-a-27_1570535113470.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
