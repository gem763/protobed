He was very, very moved. At first he did not utter any words,\u201d Olsson said.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is not a political prize, it is a literary prize.\u201d\n\nCONTROVERSIES\n\nHandke, a native of the Austrian province of Carinthia, which borders Slovenia, established himself as one of the most influential writers in Europe after World War Two, the Academy said. He also co-wrote the script of the critically-acclaimed 1987 film \u201cWings of Desire\u201d.\n\nThe author of books such as \u201cThe Goalie\u2019s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick\u201d and \u201cSlow Homecoming\u201d, he attracted widespread criticism attending the funeral of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in 2006.\n\nBritish writer Salman Rushdie once criticised him for \u201ca series of impassioned apologias for the genocidal regime of Slobodan Milosevic\u201d.\n\nA perennial candidate for the world\u2019s top literary prize, Handke appeared to have given up the idea of winning, telling the New York Times in 2006 he no longer cared.\n\nA combination of file photos shows Polish author Olga Tokarczuk attending a news conference to promote the movie 'Spoor' at the 67th Berlinale International Film Festival in Berlin, Germany, February 12, 2017 (L), and Austrian author and director Peter Handke receiving an art and culture award on occasion of his 70th birthday marked today in Salzburg, December 6, 2012.

Since then, she has produced a steady and varied stream of works and her novel \u201cFlights\u201d won her the high-profile Man Booker International Prize last year. She was the first Polish author to do so.\n\nTokarczuk\u2019s husband told Reuters that he and his wife were on a road in Germany as part of book tour.\n\nBut she wrote on Facebook: \u201cNobel Prize for Literature! Joy and emotion took my speech away. Thank you very much for all your congratulations!\u201d\n\nShe later told Polish broadcaster TVN she was proud that her books covering small towns in Poland can be read universally and be important for people elsewhere in the world.\n\n\u201cI believe in the novel. I think the novel is something incredible. This is a deep way of communication, above the borders, above languages, cultures. It refers to the in-depth similarity between people, teaches us empathy,\u201d she said.\n\nThough some episodes she has written about do not reflect the version of history promoted by Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice, her agent said the award should not be seen in the context of a parliamentary election Poland will hold on Sunday.\n\nOn winning a Polish literary award in 2015 for \u201cThe Book of Jacob\u201d, which deals with Poland\u2019s relations with its Jewish minority and neighbouring Ukraine, she outraged nationalists with her comments and received death threats.\n\nPoland\u2019s culture minister, Piotr Glinski, said the award to Tokarczuk was a success for Polish culture. Earlier this week, Glinski said he had started reading Tokarczuk\u2019s books many times but never finished any of them, a failing that he said on Twitter he would now seek to correct.\n\nDonald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister who is now President of the European Council, which includes the heads of state or government of EU member states, wrote on Twitter: \u201cI will brag about it in Brussels as a Pole and a faithful reader who has read everything from beginning to end.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nFor a graphic of Nobel laureates:\n\nhere", "description": "Austrian writer Peter Handke won the 2019 Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday and Polish author Olga Tokarczuk was named as the 2018 winner after a sexual assault scandal led to last year's award being postponed.", "authors": ["Simon Johnson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439286834&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991CW", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
