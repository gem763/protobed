REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File photo (Ronen Zvulun/Reuters)\n\nA long-brewing corruption case against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shifted to the next phase Wednesday, escalating the embattled premier\u2019s legal peril even as he fights to retain office following last month\u2019s closely divided election.\n\nThe first of four pre-indictment hearings, which have been anticipated for months, convened at the Ministry of Justice on Wednesday morning, signaling the determination of the country\u2019s independent attorney general to pursue charges against its longest-serving prime minister.\n\nThe drama has Israel wondering if even Netanyahu, a legendary political lock picker, could cling to power from a defense dock.\n\n[Netanyahu tapped to try forming a new government]\n\n\u201cThe very holding of this hearing will be, I think, a watershed event,\u201d said Amotz Asa-El, a longtime political commentator and fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute. \u201cI think this will finally spell the beginning of his departure.\u201d\n\nThe investigation, which Netanyahu has dismissed as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d has cast a shadow on Israeli politics for more than a year. In February, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit announced his intention to indict Netanyahu, pending these hearings, on charges of fraud, bribery and breach of trust going back to 2011.\n\n\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin and his wife Sarah casts their votes at a voting station in Jerusalem on September 17, 2019.

Legally, he is not obliged to step down unless convicted, and he would have a chance to appeal even then. But the previous premier to be convicted of criminal charges, Ehud Olmert in 2009, resigned his office before being formally indicted.\n\nThe hearings that began Wednesday represent the prime minister\u2019s last chance to head off, or reduce, the expected charges. But legal experts say the attorney general is unlikely to change course now, meaning that indictments could land in the middle of the ongoing struggle to form a new government.\n\nNetanyahu was not required to attend the hearing and instead was expected to spend the morning trying to salvage talks on a possible power-sharing agreement between his Likud party and the Blue and White party of his political rival, former army chief of staff Benny Gantz. The election last month left their parties with a similar level of support in the Knesset, or parliament, and neither close to a majority.\n\nLast week, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin gave Netanyahu 28 days to craft a ruling coalition, urging Likud and Blue and White to reach a compromise. Talks faltered, and as his hearing began Wednesday, Netanyahu was reportedly close to returning the mandate to the president, possibly giving Gantz a chance to try.\n\nGantz pledged during his campaign that he would never serve in a governing coalition with Likud as long as a legally besieged Netanyahu led the party. Netanyahu has maintained a decade-long grip on Likud, but his court battle could soften his support among nervous party members.\n\n\u201cWhen you combine his legal situation with his failure in the election, he has morphed from being a major asset to a major liability,\u201d Amotz said. \u201cThey will do it softly, but nonetheless they will stab him.\u201d\n\nThe accusations against Netanyahu stem from three separate criminal cases. In one, investigators allege the Netanyahus accepted more than a quarter of a million dollars in jewelry, cigars and other gifts from wealthy benefactors who had official business with the government, among them the Israeli-born producer Arnon Milchan, whose credits include \u201cFight Club\u201d and \u201cPretty Woman.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu is alleged to have repeatedly pressed the United States to grant Milchan a U.S. visa, while at home pressuring the Israeli finance minister to extend an income tax exemption that would benefit the producer.\n\nIn another case, while serving as his own minister of communications, Netanyahu allegedly intervened to smooth the way for a merger sought by Shaul Elovitch, majority shareholder of Bezeq, the country\u2019s largest telecommunications company, in exchange for favorable coverage on the popular news website Walla, also owned by Elovitch. Walla reporters and editors have described being ordered to spike stories, tweak headlines and change photographs in ways that boosted Netanyahu\u2019s image.\n\nNetanyahu has insisted he will not step down even if indicted, setting up a possible showdown between a defiant elected official and a legal system that prides itself on independence.\n\nIsraeli law allows for a prime minister to remain in office while being prosecuted, permitting the Knesset to remove him after a conviction. But scholars say the law did not envision a prime minister accused of such serious malfeasance, and many predicted the courts would intervene.\n\n\u201cI am of the opinion that a prime minister who is indicted on a charge of bribery cannot hold office,\u201d said Suzie Navot, a professor of constitutional law at the Haim Striks Law School in Rishon LeZion . \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t step down, the Supreme Court will become involved.\u201d\n\nAmong the theories at play: that in exchange for agreeing to step down, the president will offer Netanyahu a preemptive pardon or the attorney general will offer to reduce the charges in a plea bargain.\n\nBut Navot said such grand bargains amount to special treatment within the legal system for VIPs, letting them avoid prison where other defendants would not. That is too high a price just to spare the nation the uncertainty and drama of a criminal prosecution, she said.\n\n\u201cI think a strong democracy is judged by the way it deals with very important people,\u201d Navot said. \u201cWe have had a president in prison, a former prime minister in prison, a chief rabbi in prison. This is something Israel should be proud of.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nNetanyahu tapped by Israel\u2019s president to try forming a new government\n\nThe battle to reform a soccer club notorious for racist fans reveals Israel\u2019s deep divide\n\nNetanyahu offers West Bank annexation to right-wing voters ahead of cliffhanger election\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The Israeli attorney general is expected to pursue a prosecution of the prime minister on allegations of fraud, bribery and breach of trust.", "authors": ["Steve Hendrix", "Jerusalem Bureau Chief Steve Hendrix Has Written For Foreign", "National", "Local", "Most Other Sections Of The Post.", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2JeHw2zG1bViNH1B4yYEHsQIO00=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MOPLQ3HEQEI6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg"}
