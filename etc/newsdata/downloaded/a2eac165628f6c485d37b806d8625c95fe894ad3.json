Yet Hansen evidently took no offence by the outburst.\n\n\u201cEddie and I both know that all is fair in love and war,\u201d Hansen said on Thursday. \u201cThere is nothing better in war than throw a wee distraction out that you guys can\u2019t resist.

Rugby World Cup semi-final: England vs New Zealand predicted team 1/24 England vs New Zealand Here's the team Eddie Jones should select for the Rugby World Cup semi-final against New Zealand. AFP via Getty Images 2/24 1. Mako Vunipola After coming through his first start in five months last weekend with flying colours, Eddie Jones knows he has one of his genuine world class players to call upon from the start. Vunipola completely changes the way that England\u2019s pack are able to impose themselves on the opposition, which enables the likes of Billy Vunipola and Manu Tuilagi to reap the benefits. AFP via Getty Images 3/24 2. Jamie George Has a point to prove after the criticism he received following his struggles against the All Blacks last November. England\u2019s lineout has been lauded by this correspondent as currently the best in the world \u2013 now it\u2019s time for them to prove it. Getty Images 4/24 3. Kyle Sinckler His excellent display against Australia felt like a breakout performance that will have filled him with confidence ahead of what will be the biggest game of his career since the Lions tour. Sinckler is proving one of the gems in the pack that is proving his class by the minute. Getty Images, 5/24 4. Maro Itoje If New Zealand could have one player from the England side in their squad, it would be Itoje. The dynamic forward has been one of England\u2019s most consistent performers in Japan and has led their turnover charts, proving what a thorn he is in the backside of opponents. AFP via Getty Images 6/24 5. George Kruis He has swapped places with Courtney Lawes throughout the tournament and I\u2019d expect no different for this occasion, given the emphasis that Eddie Jones has put on the lineout. Kruis also brings extra bulk in the carrying department. Getty Images 7/24 6. Tom Curry Man of the match against Australia at the age of 21, Curry now has a target on his back that the Kiwis will have spotted. His place could have been at risk in order to play Courtney Lawes to strengthen the lineout, but breaking up the \u2018Undercurry\u2019 duo would be a travesty. Getty Images, 8/24 7. Sam Underhill The second part of England\u2019s dynamic flank duo, Underhill has proven worth his weight in gold in Japan, having formed a back-row of the likes that England have never seen before. Getty Images, 9/24 8. Billy Vunipola With fitness concerns and burnout fears done and dusted, Vunipola is the easy choice at No 8. AFP via Getty Images 10/24 9. Ben Youngs One of the survivors of the victorious 2012 team, Youngs has had a good World Cup up until now, but he will need to be at his very best to outshine opposite number Aaron Smith. AFP via Getty Images 11/24 10. George Ford A surprise choice, but one that makes sense. New Zealand lack a big ball-carrier in the centre unless they select Sonny Bill Williams, which given how Steve Hansen has gone this tour looks unlikely. In which case, England need the creativity that Ford and Farrell bring together. AFP via Getty Images 12/24 11. Jonny May There\u2019s a big concern over his hamstring, but if\u2019s he\u2019s close to fully fit May is worth the gamble. He proved his lethal finishing ability against the Wallabies, and the All Blacks know what he can do given his famous try at Twickenham in 2014. Getty 13/24 12. Owen Farrell The move to inside centre would be a surprise, but Farrell appeared to regain his confidence last weekend as displayed by his 100 per cent kicking ability. His appearance in this week\u2019s press conference said as much, and it\u2019s worth remembering that he and Ford know what to do together. Getty Images, 14/24 13. Manu Tuilagi Can he rekindle the 2012 Manu Tuilagi that blew New Zealand away? His recent form suggests he could well do so, and New Zealand know they need to hatch a plan to contain him when he\u2019s given the space out wide. Getty Images, 15/24 14. Anthony Watson The wing utilised his footwork supremely well against Australia, and having been faced with the powerhouse that was Marika Koroibete last week, George Bridge should be a welcome release. Getty Images, 16/24 15. Elliot Daly Jones\u2019s go-to man at full-back, Daly needs something closer to what he produced against Argentina than the Australia game. AFP via Getty Images 17/24 16. Luke Cowan-Dickie AFP via Getty Images 18/24 17. Joe Marler Getty Images 19/24 18. Dan Cole AFP/Getty Images 20/24 19. Courtney Lawes AFP via Getty Images 21/24 20.

He was very deliberate in not doing that. He talked about it being somebody else. It was probably the same bloke who videoed us when we were there, but everyone has jumped on it and he\u2019s been successful in getting the clickbait.\n\n\u201cHe was very particular about what he said, that someone had filmed their training. He said it could have been a supporter. He didn\u2019t say New Zealand did it.\u201d\n\nThe two shared an exchange of text messages at the start of the week to say they will look forward to a beer together after the match, and they appear to have remained in touch following the \u2018spygate\u2019 storm.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been in touch with me but not about those claims. A few other things,\u201d added Hansen. \u201cHe sent me a text, asked \u2018how are you doing?\u2019 I had a good chuckle, he had a chuckle. We didn\u2019t buy into any of it [the mind games]. Did he send smiley faces? No. He\u2019s not a smiley face kind of guy. It\u2019s about trying to take some pressure off his team.\u201d\n\nJones did use his media appearance on Tuesday to claim that all the pressure to deliver in Saturday\u2019s semi-final will be on the All Blacks and their attempts to secure an historic three-peat, having won the 2011 and 2015 World Cups. But Hansen did hit back at his old friend\u2019s claim that the pressure will be \u201cchasing them down the street\u201d by turning it back around on England.\n\n\u201cThat same pressure\u2019s running down the same street we\u2019re on,\u201d Hansen added. \u201cI\u2019ve got memories of a tournament four years ago that didn\u2019t go that good for them\u2026\u201d\n\nThe decision to drop Cane from the back-row came as something of a surprise, although the success that New Zealand enjoyed at the set-piece in their 16-15 victory at Twickenham last November explains the move as Barrett enjoyed plenty of success in the lineout alongside Sam Whitelock, Brodie Retallick and Kieran Read once he came on in the second half.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to go into too much depth because then we\u2019ll give Eddie some information,\u201d said Hansen. \u201cIt\u2019s strategic, not on form \u2013 Sam Cane\u2019s playing great rugby. It\u2019s about what we want to do. Scott\u2019s a lineout forward, he adds to our ball carrying ability.\n\n\u201cThat [performance in November] had a wee bit to do with it. It\u2019s a wee bit significant.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand: Beauden Barrett; Sevu Reece, Jack Goodhue, Anton Lienert-Brown, George Bridge; Richie Mo\u2019unga, Aaron Smith; Joe Moody, Codie Taylor, Nepo Laulala; Brodie Retallick, Sam Whitelock; Scott Barrett, Ardie Savea, Kieran Read.\n\nReplacements: Dane Coles, Ofa Tuungafasi, Angus Ta\u2019avao, Patrick Tuipulotu, Sam Cane, TJ Perenara, Sonny Bill Williams, Jordie Barrett.", "description": "New Zealand\u00a0boss Steve Hansen has no issue with England\u00a0counterpart Eddie Jones following this week\u2019s spy allegations in the build-up to their Rugby World Cup semi-final, though the All Blacks boss did stress that their opponents are under more pressure to deliver after their 2015 failure.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/24/06/steve-hansen.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
