The sums could range from $200 to several thousands of dollars a month, Schull noted.\n\nSugar friendships are mutually beneficial relationships with someone the women considers a friend.\n\nA study by a Colorado academic reveals seven types of 'sugar' relationships, ranging from the sex-for-money arrangements to purely platonic affairs\n\nBenefactors in these arrangements are often a part of the women\u2019s lives already or soon become a part of it.\n\n'Sugar friendships with sexual benefits' is more unstructured. In some cases, benefactors pay for all living expenses for the women, including rent, cell phone bills, clothing, cars, and vacations.\n\nMaren Shcull, PhD assistant professor at University of Colorado Denver, (pictured), explored the kind of activities the women were involved in\n\nFinally, Scull found that some of these relationships involved two people who hoped to end up together, with the woman taken care of for the rest of her life, in a category she named 'pragmatic love.'\n\n'When we lump sugar relationships together as prostitution, it deviantizes and criminalizes these relationships,' said Scull.\n\n'We were missing how they are often organic and involve genuine, emotional connection.\n\n'Many of the women didn\u2019t intend on having a benefactor. They just happened to meet someone at work or during a catering gig who wanted to take care of them. These relationships can last decades.'\n\nSugar baby Taylor, 22, told the New York Post that she has an 86-year-old sugar daddy and they have a 'sugar dating' arrangement.\n\nHe pays her bills and gives her a monthly stipend of $2,500, she said. She added that they have been together for three years and have never had sex.\n\n'We exchange emails or speak on the phone most days,' she told the outlet, adding that their dynamic is 'a little more nuanced than just friendship, because there\u2019s a subtext that\u2019s always there that if he were younger, we would be romantically involved.'", "description": "There are seven types of 'sugar daddy' relationships ranging from purely platonic to more sexual affairs, according to a study.
