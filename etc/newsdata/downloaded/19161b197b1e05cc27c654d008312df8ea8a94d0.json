I'm so happy to be behind an offensive line like that that just loves to push people around.\"\n\nWATCH | Bombers' late interception spells end for Montreal:\n\nA late interception spelled the end for Montreal in a 35-24 loss at the hands of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. 1:38\n\nNick Taylor's fourth-quarter interception for a touchdown was a highlight but the Bombers (10-6) relied more on a solid ground game to beat the Alouettes.\n\nHarris and Drew Wolitarsky both had TDs as the Bombers took a five-point lead into the second. Kicker Justin Medlock added three field goals before Taylor's interception the fourth and one more with less than two minutes left in the game.\n\nA 90-yard runback by Mario Alford was Montreal's lone touchdown in the first half. Jake Wieneke added another in the third quarter and Boris Bede added a field goal. Quan Bray had a final score for the visitors with less than a minute left.\n\nThe Alouettes' loss clinched first in the CFL's East Division for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. The Toronto Argonauts and Ottawa Redblacks have been mathematically eliminated from the post-season.\n\nLike Montreal (8-7) in the East, Winnipeg has secured its playoff spot in the West but is still jockeying for a home game or perhaps even a bye into the division final.\n\nMontreal quarterback Vernon Adams Jr., led the Alouettes back from a 20-point deficit to beat the Bombers at their last meeting, took a lot of blame for the loss.\n\n\"I've just got to get my eyes better I think, just get my eyes better and just see defenders and make those right throws,\" he said. \"I've got guys open underneath and I'm forcing things too much late in the game trying to make things happen.\n\n\"It starts at QB position. I think our defence made enough plays for us to win that game. We got in the red zone quite a few times and I just wasn't finishing ... I've just got to be better.\"\n\nStreveler also gave credit to Winnipeg's defence for the pressure they put on Adams and the Montreal offence.\n\n\"When you take the ball away five times ... it's unreal and that's awesome,\" said the Winnipeg QB, who inherited the starting job when Matt Nichols was injured in August.", "description": "Nick Taylor's interception for a touchdown was a highlight but the Blue Bombers relied more on a solid ground game to beat the Montreal Alouettes 35-24 on Saturday, getting a little payback after their last meeting when Winnipeg surrendered a 20-point lead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5319727.1570923687!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fbo-cfl-alouettes-blue-bombers-20191012.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
