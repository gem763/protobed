The Shadow Minister for West Australian resources - Matt Keogh - is backing calls to reach a 'political settlement' on emissions by adopting the Coalition's 2030 target. The move would see both sides of politics support reducing emissions by 28 per cent of 2005 levels, within 11 years. Labor leader Anthony Albanese was forced to weigh in to the debate from Hawaii overnight, doubling down on the party\u2019s ambitious climate policy agenda. \u201cI am proud that Labor has consistently supported strong action on Climate Change based upon the science, and that action will not only protect our environment but is also good for our economy,\u201d he Tweeted.
