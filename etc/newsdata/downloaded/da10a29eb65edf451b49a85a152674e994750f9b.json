ABC News has not independently reviewed the data. The sources said it\u2019s likely to inform Trump\u2019s decision on whether to act on any gun control legislation, despite separate nationwide polling showing widespread public support for tougher gun sale background checks.\n\nThe White House requested data from the campaign on how Trump\u2019s base and independent voters would react if Trump were to support gun control measures late last month, after the Dayton and El Paso shootings, the sources told ABC News. On Aug. 31, seven more were killed in Texas in a shooting rampage in Odessa.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abcnews.Go.Com Politics Trump-Campaign-Data-Shows-Gun-Control-Measures-Pose Story Id"], "top_image": ""}
