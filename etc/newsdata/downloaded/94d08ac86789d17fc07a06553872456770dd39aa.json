With an understanding of animal welfare, horse drawn carriages can continue to function in an ethical way, supporting the owners that survive on them as a means of vital income.\u201d\n\nMany mayors have promised to tackle the practice, with Raggi pledging to ban it as part of her 2016 campaign.\n\nIn 2017, the local authority announced plans to move the horses from the streets to Rome\u2019s parks, plus introduce a ban on them having to do tours from June to September and when the temperature exceeds 30C.\n\nHowever, in practice, not much has changed \u2013 despite Raggi claiming that Rome was \u201ca leader in safeguarding and protecting animals\u201d back in July.\n\nENPA, the national agency for animal protection, has added its voice to the call for horse-drawn carriage rides to be abandoned: \u201cDuring the election campaign the mayor promised to save the horses from the chaotic streets of Rome \u2013 we ask national politicians to take charge of this emergency,\u201d a spokesperson told The Guardian.\n\nThere are currently around 80 horses working in Rome, and 32 people have licences to drive horse-drawn carriages. Raggi has stated no further licences will be issued.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time an incident has raised concern for the equines\u2019 welfare; in 2012, police had to stop a man repeatedly beating a horse which had collapsed by the Spanish Steps in hot weather.", "description": "Animal rights activists are calling for a complete ban on horse-drawn carriages in Rome after a video emerged of a horse that had collapsed in the street.
