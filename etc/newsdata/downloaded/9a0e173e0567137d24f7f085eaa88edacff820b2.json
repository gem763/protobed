FOREX-Euro pinned at more than two-year lows; sterling drops\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n\n\nBy Saikat Chatterjee\n\nLONDON, Sept 27 (Reuters) - The euro held at its lowest\n\nlevel in more than two years on Friday as quarter-end\n\nrebalancing flows boosted demand for the dollar, with investors\n\nunfazed by the latest political news out of the United States.\n\nThe euro EUR=EBS fell 0.1% lower to $1.0904, its lowest\n\nlevel since May 2017. Against a basket of its rivals , the\n\ngreenback pushed 0.1% higher to 99.27, its highest level in more\n\nthan three weeks.\n\n\"Some corporate demand in the last few days seems to be\n\nboosting the dollar but our models show there should be net\n\nselling later in the day due to rebalancing flows,\" said Manuel\n\nOliveri, a currency strategist at Credit Agricole in London.\n\nSterling GBP=D3 was the other big loser in early London\n\ntrading after Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders\n\nhinted at looser monetary policy if Brexit uncertainty remained\n\nprolonged against a backdrop of disappointing global growth.\n\nThe pound weakened 0.3% to a new two-week low of $1.2285 on\n\nFriday as his comments raised expectations that the next move\n\nfrom the central bank could be a rate cut. Markets are also digesting the impeachment probe launched\n\ninto U.S. President Donald Trump and the latest headlines from\n\nthe trade dispute between the United States and China.\n\nA whistleblower report released on Thursday said Trump not\n\nonly abused his office in attempting to solicit Ukraine's\n\ninterference in the 2020 U.S. election, but the White House\n\ntried to \"lock down\" evidence about it. China's top diplomat said Beijing was willing to buy more\n\nU.S. products. CNBC reported that trade war talks were on track\n\nand scheduled for Oct. 10-11 in Washington, citing people\n\nfamiliar with the arrangements.\n\nElsewhere, the dollar eased against the trade-sensitive\n\nAustralian AUD=D3 and New Zealand dollars NZD=D3 , which\n\ngently rallied on hopes that next month's U.S.-China trade talks\n\nwill bring progress. Moves were slight, though and neither\n\nstrayed far from two-week troughs against the greenback.\n\n\"A one word description of currency markets trading today:\n\nmoribund,\" said markets strategist Michael McCarthy of brokerage\n\nCMC Markets in Sydney.\n\n\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Euro pinned at more than two-year lows; sterling drops", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC4316T_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
