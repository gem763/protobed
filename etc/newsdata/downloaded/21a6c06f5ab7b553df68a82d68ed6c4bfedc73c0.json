(iStock)\n\nThree dog trainers are accused of animal cruelty for allegedly using cayenne pepper to get show dogs to perform a scene while filming in Pennsylvania for the cable series \u201cManhunt: Lone Wolf.\u201d\n\nAntonio Spencer, 32, and Ed Wiernik, 59, each face two counts of animal cruelty, and Philip Hoelcher, 73, faces four counts after a report to the cruelty hotline of Pittsburgh-based animal-resource community Animal Friends. Hoelcher denies the allegations.\n\nAn employee for the show\u2019s camera department made a call to the hotline July 24 citing concerns about animal cruelty involving German shepherd-type dogs, according to court documents dated Aug. 29.\n\nThe trainers were tasked with getting the dogs to react as if they had eaten a cayenne pepper, but when the animals didn\u2019t do as instructed, their handlers used a small amount of cayenne pepper on the dogs\u2019 noses, which didn\u2019t work, according to the report.\n\nThe trainers then used a handful of cayenne pepper, the court documents said. \u201cAfter Wiernik put the cayenne pepper in the dog\u2019s nose, the dog immediately dropped down to the ground and attempted to rub his face through the dirt and foliage. \u2026 These actions were repeated,\u201d according to the court records.\n\nLionsgate, the entertainment company behind the cable series, told Trib Live in a statement that it has an excellent track record for protecting animals on its sets. \u201cWe take any allegations of animal cruelty very seriously,\u201d it said.\n\nA veterinarian who was consulted for the investigation said that inhaling cayenne pepper can cause medical emergencies in animals ranging from irritation and burning of the mucous membranes of the nose and throat passageways to respiratory distress, which could lead to \u201cembolism, respiratory arrest or death,\u201d according to the report.\n\nRobert Fredley, the chief humane police officer with Animal Friends, said he spoke with David \u201cBilly\u201d Cole, a production office coordinator, who told him that there was probably a miscommunication based on the script.\n\nThe trainers used a mixture of apple cider vinegar, lemon and broccoli to rub onto the dog\u2019s nose so it could wipe it off, Cole said, adding that it was a common practice, according to the report.\n\nHoelcher, a veteran movie stuntman and animal trainer, said that he never used cayenne pepper to get the dogs on set to behave a certain way.\n\n\u201cThe props department has cayenne pepper,\u201d he said, explaining that he couldn\u2019t verify whether it was real. \u201cWhy in the world would I do something like that?\u201d\n\nSpencer, his attorney and Wiernik didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhen a dog is exposed to cayenne pepper, the animal\u2019s reaction can cause the spice to spread, leading to more irritation, which could last for days or weeks, said Carlo Siracusa, associate professor of clinical behavior medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nSiracusa said pepper is frequently recommended in online forums as a way to keep dogs away from plants or out of off-limits areas in the home, something he doesn\u2019t suggest for a dog\u2019s well-being because of the potential health risks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a form of abuse because you\u2019re forcing the animal to do something detrimental to its quality of life,\u201d he said.\n\nUse of cayenne could even result in the canine not doing what the trainer wants it to do, he said.\n\nMichael San Filippo, spokesman for the American Veterinary Medical Association, also discouraged using cayenne pepper to train animals.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to training animals, it\u2019s best to focus on positive reinforcement strategies \u2014 such as praise, play and treats \u2014 that don\u2019t have the potential for harm,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nA Good Samaritan claimed to rescue a dog with horrible injuries.
