When your beliefs collide with your partner\u2019s, whose desires take top priority? What do you do when you\u2019ve escaped an abusive relationship, but the scars still remain? What about when your partner\u2019s trauma means that you two can never actually confront the conflicts in your own relationship?\n\nIt\u2019s time to stop beating your head against pointless sidequests and start finding the most efficient path to your goals. Let\u2019s do this.\n\nHey Dr. NerdLove, Here\u2019s the deal, I recently married my wife and she\u2019s excellent in every way. We agree on MOST things, but there are some very definitive differences between how we see the world. I never minded it, I have plenty of friends who are on a different page than me and we get along just fine. Same with her, we can usually have a pretty civil conversation about things and I\u2019ve made many concessions when it comes to one thing we\u2019re pretty opposite about. Religion. I\u2019m an atheist, she\u2019s Catholic. I\u2019m not a \u201cyou\u2019re dumb if you believe in God\u201d kind of atheist (they suck), just someone who has developed a different answer. I was able to develop this because my parents didn\u2019t make me go to church and when we did, which was rare, it was a Unitarian church so not really hyper religious. Most of the other people in the youth group there were atheist or agnostic and we really didn\u2019t talk about God. When we got married I didn\u2019t want to be married in a church or by a priest for a variety of reasons. I was marrying her and making promises to her. God had nothing to do with it. I\u2019m not a liar either, I won\u2019t go along with something I\u2019m uncomfortable with or don\u2019t believe in (she knows this). If we had the ceremony in the church I would have felt that it wasn\u2019t real, that I didn\u2019t actually make the commitments. This wasn\u2019t without concession though. Her uncle gave a very nice blessing for dinner. When this happens, no matter where I am, I bow my head and try to be respectful. I just don\u2019t believe in it. We were discussing children and how she wants to have our children christened. I said that\u2019s fine but I probably won\u2019t go and she was very taken aback by it. She can do what she wants and if it makes her feel better then she can go for it. But I\u2019m not going to a church to support my child being indoctrinated in something I don\u2019t even believe in. I researched it and they might even make me go to religious classes? No way. Not in a million years. This isn\u2019t to say that I wouldn\u2019t support my child should they want to be religious, I\u2019d just rather them come to that conclusion themselves when they\u2019re older. Her response to this is that they just won\u2019t believe in it then which, for me, kind of puts the whole religion thing into question if the only way to get our child into it is at a young age when they\u2019re malleable. I think an educated young adult could still be into religion without parents pushing it on them at a young age. Note that she never goes to church, not even for Christmas. Religion hasn\u2019t played a huge role in her life as far as I know beyond CCD and all the youth stuff. It\u2019s not part of her identity as far as I can see and she never talks about it. I\u2019ve always been open about my atheism and we\u2019ve had conversations about it so I don\u2019t think she\u2019s hiding it from me. Maybe she feels differently, but she\u2019s never come across as religious even though she believes in God. Is it unreasonable that I don\u2019t want to be at a christening? Again, if she wants to do it that\u2019s fine, I just don\u2019t want a part in it. At the end of the day I\u2019d feel uncomfortable and wouldn\u2019t want to be there. I\u2019d cringe when God is mentioned over my child and I wouldn\u2019t say anything affirming during the ceremony. It may be better if I\u2019m not there. I\u2019ve been very clear where I stand and I\u2019m trying not to be rude, I just feel like my feelings and concerns should be just as valid as hers. I\u2019m not trying to control her either and I would never do something like that. Am I wrong? Please help! Trying To Be Reasonable\n\nThere\u2019s a reasonable disagreement and then there\u2019s being an arsehole for no good reason, TTBR, and you\u2019re trending really close to the latter half of that equation. For someone who doesn\u2019t believe in a god or the primacy of a religion, you sure seem to put a whole lot of importance on it when you have to be around it.\n\nI mean, why would your marriage be any less real or committed if you got married in a church by a priest? If you aren\u2019t a believer, a church is just a building, a priest is just a man in a fancy outfit and the liturgy and Mass is just something you have to sit through until you can get to the reception. Your marriage is between you and your wife; its legal validity is conveyed by the state, and the priest\u2019s relevance to that is strictly about being the guy who signed the licence. No buy-in required.\n\nYour reaction to it kind of implies a level of antipathy that you\u2019re saying isn\u2019t there, and I think that\u2019s colouring a lot of your reactions here. That antipathy is making you blind to some things that are pretty relevant here beyond whether or not you\u2019re a believer or if your wife isn\u2019t an observant Catholic.\n\nReligion is more than just rules in a book or a series of dictates handed down from on high by a god or goddess; it\u2019s rituals, ceremonies and traditions that can bring comfort and security. It\u2019s a community people take part in and a culture that can be an important part of who they are, even if they\u2019re not an active participant now. There\u2019re plenty of folks who are \u2014 to coin a phrase \u2014 culturally Catholic: they may not believe in the doctrine, but they like the routine and ritual and showmanship. That can be important to someone, even if they don\u2019t believe in the intercession of the saints or the canonical infallibility of the pontiff.\n\nYou\u2019re a grown-arse man; presumably you\u2019re capable of going along to get along and keeping your poker-face on during the parts you disagree with.\n\nSo while your wife may not be an active Catholic, it certainly sounds like some of the rites are pretty significant to her.\n\nShe may not believe that baptising your theoretical children will give them an in with God, but the ritual of it can be a link in a chain that unites her with her background and with her family\u2019s history. That can be more important to somebody than whether or not it brings their soul in line with God. It may also be an important concession from her to her family. She may be cool with marrying a (in their minds) hell-bound heathen, but her family may be less so. Having a traditional baptism can help soothe ruffled feathers and ease tensions.\n\nNow look, I get it. It ain\u2019t like the Catholic Church doesn\u2019t have a long and profoundly fucked up history, or that religion hasn\u2019t been as much scourge as comfort. But right now, you\u2019re picking fights that don\u2019t need to happen for no reason other than stubbornness. Marriages and relationships are about compromise. Sometimes the compromise is \u201cyou do your thing, I do mine,\u201d but other times, the compromise is \u201cyou do this thing you don\u2019t really care for because it\u2019s important to your partner.\u201d While she may not be practicing, your wife\u2019s Catholicism is clearly important to her. By digging in your heels and saying \u201cnope, I refuse to participate,\u201d you\u2019re not making a principled stand, you\u2019re directly insulting something that has significance and meaning to your wife\u2026 and by extension, insulting her.\n\nThat ain\u2019t a great recipe for a long and happy relationship, chief.\n\nAnd incidentally: I know you\u2019re hoping to keep your kids away from religion until they\u2019re old enough to reject it on their own, but frankly, baptism and christening ain\u2019t indoctrination. Your theoretical kids aren\u2019t going to be Clockwork Orange\u2019d into being believers, nor are they going to be spirited away and not returned until they\u2019ve had their First Communion. They get a little water sprinkled over them, a priest says a few things, godparents say they\u2019re going to make sure the kid grows up to be a good person and you\u2019re pretty much done. The most the kids would get out of it is being a little confused by all the people around them, being a little damp and then probably having a nap.\n\nLetting her have this, even just for the sake of \u201chappy wife, happy life,\u201d isn\u2019t asking much of you. All it\u2019s ultimately asking of you is the cost of a couple hours out of an afternoon and a little stand, sit, kneel, stand action. You\u2019re a grown-arse man; presumably you\u2019re capable of going along to get along and keeping your poker-face on during the parts you disagree with. If it\u2019s ultimately just words and ceremony, you can make this sacrifice for your wife\u2019s happiness.\n\nDear Dr. NerdLove: A few years ago, I managed to escape an abusive partner. As you well know, these sorts of things are messy, and leave lasting damage. All the behaviours she\u2019d exhibited throughout our relationship \u2014 sexual aggression, gaslighting, social control \u2014 got cranked up to 11 during this period. One particular element she leaned on was telling me that I deserved this treatment, and that I was complicit in her behaviour. She laid the blame on me and accused me of being abusive, as I was \u2014 in this conception of reality \u2014 the root cause of her behaviour. One of the most depressing elements of this whole disaster is that I cannot shake this repulsive, gut feeling that she was right, even though I believe this to not be true. I\u2019ve since taken steps to ground myself when this feeling bubbles up. I\u2019ve written down an account of my abuse that I revisit just to look at it and go \u201cthis was real, this happened, and I did not deserve this violence.\u201d Still, there is that little voice that lives inside me that says \u201cwell, when she yelled, when she threw things, when she locked you out so you couldn\u2019t eat, etc. you did shout back.\u201d I\u2019m not in a place where I can afford therapy, and have no clue if anything I\u2019ve done to curb this is healthy. It\u2019s been so long, and I\u2019m just so tired of living with this part of myself that thinks I am a monster. Even as I write this, I fear even these vague gestures towards my story implicate me somehow, or will draw her attention (I don\u2019t even know if she reads Kotaku! She was a gamergater for christsakes! But this is what my brain tells me to be afraid of). What can I do? How do I change this? Apologies for the gravity of this. I recently read your piece on signs of an abusive relationship, and you seem much more well-read on this stuff than I am, so I thought I would try for your advice. Thanks for your time. Tired and Afraid\n\nHey TAF:\n\nFirst of all, I\u2019m so sorry that you went through this, but I\u2019m incredibly proud of you for having recognised that you were in a bad scene and that you got the everloving fuck out. That took a lot of courage and strength, and you should be commended for having done it.\n\nJust as importantly, you need to not be down on yourself for dealing with the after-effects of abuse. You\u2019ve been through the fires of hell, and you\u2019ve got the scars to prove it. Abusive relationships are traumatic, and trauma leaves its marks on people, often in ways that we rarely expect.\n\nSo first and foremost, I want you to understand: this was not your fault. To be clear: THIS WAS NOT YOUR FAULT. I want you to tattoo this backwards on your forehead so that it\u2019s the first thing you see in the morning. Shave your head if you need the room. THIS WAS NOT YOUR FAULT.\n\nWhat your abuser did is a very common technique called DARVO: Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. So \u201cI\u2019m not abusing you, you\u2019re MAKING me do this because you\u2019re the one being abusive and I\u2019m forced to do this.\u201d Abusers do this because it\u2019s a distressingly powerful way of controlling their victims.\n\nFirst, it makes the victim feel complicit in their abuse, making it harder for them to get away. They feel as though they are the ones who are in the wrong, that their abuse is something that they are responsible for. As a result, they\u2019re much less likely to seek out help; after all, who\u2019d help someone who was so shitty that their partner \u201chad\u201d to treat them this way?\n\nSecond, it controls the victim\u2019s behaviour by putting the onus on them to manage their abuser\u2019s moods and whims. If you feel that your actions are causing your partner to lash out at you, you\u2019re much more likely to give in to whatever your partner wants at the time, lest you be an awful person and trigger another outburst of abuse. So now you\u2019re walking on eggshells, trying to anticipate your partner\u2019s moods and desires in the name of being a \u201cgood\u201d partner and not a shitty person who \u201cdeserves\u201d whatever punishment your partner is forced to dish out.\n\nShit like \u201cwell, I did shout back\u201d is not only not being abusive, it\u2019s the reaction of a reasonable person in a supremely unreasonable situation. Your being intolerant of her abhorrent behaviour doesn\u2019t make you an awful, intolerant hypocrite; it makes you someone who was trying to defend themselves against somebody who was determined to break you.\n\nSo quite frankly, fuck that and double-fuck HER and the moustache she rode in on. Because \u2014 say it with me now \u2014 THIS WAS NOT YOUR FAULT.\n\nYou\u2019re stronger and braver than you realise. You\u2019ve been through some shit, and that\u2019s going to leave marks, but you will get better.\n\nNow that you\u2019re free of her, you have two responsibilities. The first is to protect yourself from her getting back into your life. That means you need to do everything you can to keep her from getting any claw-hold into you or your info. You can start with locking your shit down.\n\nChange all your passwords and put two-factor authentication on everything you can \u2014 ideally via an app like Google Authenticator, not via SMS or email. Invest in a password manager like LastPass or 1Password to make it all easier. Next: block her on every form of social media you have or think you might ever make an account on. If she has friends or enablers, block them too.\n\nMake sure your friends and family know that under no circumstances are they to share any information with her about you, even seemingly innocuous shit. The less access she has to you and the fewer ways she has of reaching you, the less you\u2019ll worry that she\u2019s going to rise up behind you like a demon rising up from a tomb.\n\nThe second responsibility is to yourself and your emotional and mental health. You\u2019ve got some serious wounds and trauma and honestly, that shit isn\u2019t going to heal itself. Not cleanly and certainly not quickly.\n\nThe good news is, you\u2019re doing a lot of things right. Writing everything down is a good start; it helps exorcise your ghosts and creates a record of what happened to you. This is important because abusers will gaslight the shit out of you and convince you that it didn\u2019t happen and if it did it wasn\u2019t that bad and if it was then you deserved it. Having that record is proof that yes it happened, it was fucking awful and she was a heinous abuser who hurt you. And most importantly THIS WAS NOT YOUR FAULT.\n\nBut you need more than this. As tempting as it can be to think that you should be able to do this on your own\u2026 you\u2019re wrong. This is a time when having people who can help you, guide you and support you is incredibly important. I know right now money is tight, but there are ways of getting help for relatively cheap, or even free.\n\nTo start with, there are apps like TalkSpace or BetterHelp, which connect you with therapists. These advertise fairly heavily on podcasts, so you may be able to find referral codes for discounts on a few sessions. You can also try self-directed therapies like cognitive behavioural therapy via sites like MoodGym.\n\nAnother viable option would be to find group therapy or a support group for survivors of abusive relationships. Group therapy has some stigma to it based around stereotypes like the movie Anger Management, but it can be an invaluable resource for getting help. Similarly, support groups can help connect you with people who\u2019ve been where you are, who can share some of the ways they recovered and remind you that you\u2019re not alone.\n\nBut there are also ways of finding low-cost or even no-cost therapy. Captain Awkward has some excellent posts about finding cheap mental health care in the U.S. and Canada on her site, and I highly recommend that you check them out.\n\nBut the most important things to remember: you\u2019re not damaged, you\u2019re not broken, you\u2019re not weak and IT WAS NOT YOUR FAULT.\n\nYou\u2019re stronger and braver than you realise. You\u2019ve been through some shit, and that\u2019s going to leave marks, but you will get better. You\u2019re OK, I promise.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this. And write back to let us know how you\u2019re doing.\n\nAll will be well.\n\nI know I\u2019m going to come off as an arsehole but I need help so here goes. My partner of five years suffers from PTSD from a past relationship. I am doing everything I can to support them both physically and emotionally. It can be very demanding at times (a fact that I really wish was discussed more when we talk about PTSD), but I do try my best, and because of that my partner feels safe. We have a good life together for the most part. My problem is that there is no way to resolve a conflict without my partner breaking down emotionally. Any argument we have ultimately ends the same way. My partner is in pieces, and I have to swallow my own feelings to help them come back down from the anxiety attack. Please don\u2019t misunderstand when I mention arguing, I don\u2019t mean full blown screaming matches. I mind my tone, take care in the words I use, and am very careful with my body language. The issue is that the act of arguing is the trigger. It has gotten to the point where I need to avoid expressing my thoughts or feelings if they aren\u2019t 100% positive. I have no way of communicating when my partner hurts me without another emotional collapse. I am out of ideas, and it\u2019s begun to make me feel like I\u2019m being manipulated by all of this. I know they aren\u2019t having anxiety attacks to hurt me. I know this isn\u2019t some way for them to trick me into getting their way, but if I\u2019m being completely honest there is still that tiny speck of doubt at the back of my mind. It\u2019s the ugly little voice that says \u201cisn\u2019t this convenient?\u201d when I\u2019m reassuring them instead of addressing my own pain. How do I communicate what I need to say without triggering my partner? How do I tell them I\u2019m their partner too, not just their caretaker? - Not Just A Caretaker\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to give my standard disclaimer: Dr. NerdLove is not a real doctor and there are going to be times when it may be a better idea to talk to a counselor or actual doctor instead of a loudmouth with an advice column.\n\nYou\u2019re right, NJAC, we don\u2019t talk much about what it can mean to live with someone with PTSD or how to care for yourself when your partner is recovering from trauma. It can feel a little selfish to say \u201cyeah, this is hard on me\u201d when someone you love is dealing with the aftermath of having survived some heavy shit\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not important or that it can\u2019t be difficult.\n\nIt can also put you into a tricky situation because on the one hand, you don\u2019t want to treat them like spun glass, but on the other hand, you don\u2019t want to trigger their PTSD. In a very real way it can feel like tiptoeing through a minefield and never being entirely sure if you\u2019re on safe ground or if you\u2019re about to hit another landmine.\n\nOne of the hard parts, especially in cases like yours, is dealing with the nagging doubts. When you\u2019re in a relationship with somebody who has issues with intense emotion or just arguing, it can certainly feel like maybe it\u2019s not entirely genuine. And that can be rough, because it\u2019s an ugly catch-22. It\u2019s a legitimate concern \u2014 people can and do abuse the concept of triggering to get their way \u2014 but folks do have very real sensitivities after trauma that can make life difficult for them and the people around them.\n\nThat\u2019s why when those doubts creep in, it can be important to look at things logically. Are these events things that only happen with you, or does it manifest in their day to day life outside of your relationship? Are they having trouble navigating the world around them or does it seem confined to a very specific set of circumstances? Looking at it dispassionately can help reassure you that yes, it\u2019s a real thing and a real problem.\n\nBreaking yourself into pieces isn\u2019t going to make them better; it just makes things worse for both of you.\n\nIt can also help you find solutions. If they\u2019re able to find ways to work around this, say, at work, then that might be something that you can incorporate into your own relationship in order to resolve conflicts. If they\u2019re talking to a counselor or therapist \u2014 and I hope they are \u2014 then their therapist may have some suggestions for how the two of you can work through these issues together.\n\nHowever, one thing that may help is to put a layer or two between you and your partner at times when you need to have these discussions. If the issue comes from having these discussions, then it may help to disperse the impact of them a little by not having them in person. If the issues don\u2019t require immediate action, it may help to have these discussions in an asynchronous manner via text.\n\nConsider setting up an email thread or a Discord channel specifically for discussing these issues. Text can feel less confrontational and less in-your-face than an in-person discussion. It can often be easier to say things in an email, where you\u2019re able to think about what you need to say and how to say it, than in person.\n\nYou\u2019re in a better position to find the right words and the right phrasing when you\u2019re writing something out, instead of trying to come up with it in the moment. And because writing accesses a different part of the brain than speech, the message may not be as intimidating or triggering.\n\nThe other benefit of email or Discord, rather than texting or DMs, is that it\u2019s inherently asynchronous; you\u2019re not expected to respond in real time. This way, there\u2019s less immediacy and, with it, less of an expectation to react right then and there, which may be easier for your partner to handle.\n\nHaving more time to sit with their thoughts or to process their reaction and then respond, may make it easier to actually resolve things if you don\u2019t have to worry about either avoiding a panic attack or comforting them through it while you\u2019re having these discussions.\n\nJust as importantly, though: Take care of yourself. It doesn\u2019t do you any good to help and care for your partner if you neglect yourself in the process. You may also want to look into finding help or counseling for yourself. Secondary traumatization is very real, and it affects caregivers and partners of people with PTSD.\n\nYou need your own support network and a Team You outside of the relationship for your own emotional health and self-care. You need to have people you can talk to about your own frustrations and needs and people who can provide you with support and nurturing as well. You and your partner may be part of a whole, but you\u2019re individuals too, and you have your own needs. You can\u2019t be all things to one another, nor should you try.\n\nAnd it\u2019s important to note that there can come a point where you just can\u2019t continue in this relationship and be healthy, and that\u2019s OK. It doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re selfish or that you\u2019re an arsehole leaving someone in their time of need; it means that you aren\u2019t right for one another. It doesn\u2019t do them or you any good if trying to help them means destroying yourself in the process.\n\nYou have a responsibility to yourself as much as you do to them. Breaking yourself into pieces isn\u2019t going to make them better; it just makes things worse for both of you. Sometimes the kindest thing for both of you is to be free to find someone who is better suited and better equipped for what you both need.\n\nYou\u2019re in an incredibly difficult place, and I wish I had an easy or simple solution for you. Hopefully the two of you are able to find an accommodation that works \u2014 one that resolves your issues without triggering more in the process.\n\nWrite back to let us know how you\u2019re doing.\n\nGood luck.\n\nHarris O\u2019Malley is a writer and dating coach who provides geek dating advice at his blog Paging Dr. NerdLove and the Dr. NerdLove YouTube channel.
