(Photo by Jayne Kamin-Oncea/Getty Images)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 For a lot of them, what\u2019s next, or what could be next, will be foreign. The Tampa Bay Rays haven\u2019t done a lot of Octobers lately, which means five consecutive Septembers that have ended poorly, lost somewhere in the teeth of the AL East rip saw.\n\nSo it is that late Monday night, Rays outfielder Kevin Kiermaier had to know the score in Oakland first \u2014 Kansas City Royals 6, Oakland A\u2019s 5 \u2014 and then could fall asleep. The idle Rays had drawn a half-game closer to hosting a wild card game, had remained a game-and-a-half clear of the Cleveland Indians, and this is what it looks like, what it feels like, when all the numbers go away, when there are only games to win or not.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cI got gray hairs,\u201d Tommy Pham shrieked, brushing his hand over a head that showed none. \u201cI\u2019m so stressed out.\u201d\n\nThat bad, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be better,\u201d he said, \u201cif I hit three home runs tonight.\u201d\n\nAnd he went off to prepare to do that, or try.\n\nThe Rays\u2019 starting lineup Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium would carry 66 postseason at-bats, 55 of them by catcher Travis d\u2019Arnaud, six by Matt Duffy and five by Pham. The Dodgers\u2019 lineup had seen 671 October at-bats. Cody Bellinger\u2019s dad had as many as all but two Rays starters.\n\nThey don\u2019t keep that sort of stuff on a scoreboard. It does, however, speak to what these Rays have achieved across 152 games and for the 10-game journey ahead, in the coming days through the Dodgers and Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays, and what could lie beyond that. They\u2019ll likely have had to win 94, 95, 96 games, which is something even in a league in which only about half the teams are really trying.\n\n\u201cThis is what you play for,\u201d Kiermaier said. \u201cThis is a blast.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout then a 6-foot-4 man entered the room, unremarkable in a room of athletes except for how much of the room he took up. And the fact he was wearing green flannel on a warm afternoon. And that he was Blake Snell, Cy Young Award winner a season ago, and he\u2019d be pitching Tuesday night for the first time in nearly two months. The Rays were 32-17 without him, gaining no ground on the Yankees but losing none either, and actually gaining on the A\u2019s and Indians, who would shake out as their wild card competition.\n\nTampa Bay Rays pitcher Blake Snell missed two months before his return to the team. (Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThree days after Tyler Glasnow went three innings for the Rays, on the same night Luis Severino went four for the Yankees and Brandon Woodruff two for the Milwaukee Brewers, five days after the Dodgers had hoped for two innings from Rich Hill, in a September in which starters, some of them front-end caliber, are being ramped up for October, Snell struck out four Dodgers and allowed one ball into fair territory over two innings.\n\nSix weeks ago, Snell had surgery to remove six chips from his pitching elbow. Until then, he hadn\u2019t quite been the pitcher he\u2019d been in 2018, when he\u2019d won 21 games and had a 1.89 ERA. Then, few pitchers had been. It might\u2019ve been the chips.\n\nThe plan is for a couple more starts for Snell, gradually increasing his pitch count, the way they do in spring training. The current schedule could, in the best scenario for the Rays, put Charlie Morton in position to pitch the wild card game and Snell the first game of a division series. These things so rarely go as planned, as evidenced by all the quality starting pitchers trying to extend themselves into another inning, another 10 pitches, building toward October or a shot at it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge benefit, but we\u2019ve still got a lot to do,\u201d Rays manager Kevin Cash said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get him built up. I mean, we might have enough time here as long as (Snell and Glasnow) are performing like they\u2019re capable of. We get them to a reasonable workload and pitch count. Then, yeah, we have two really, really special pitchers who are capable of quieting opposing lineups for a period of time.\u201d\n\nFor his part, and for the 26 pitches he threw, Snell looked like the same guy. His fastball clocked at 95 and 96 mph. He threw sliders and curveballs and changeups. Each of his strikeouts \u2014 of David Freese, Chris Taylor, Cody Bellinger and Max Muncy \u2014 were on fastballs, and big ones at that. He walked off the mound as though he had another 50 pitches in him.\n\nBefore becoming self-conscious about the gray hair that did not exist, Pham looked over at the big fella in the green flannel and said, \u201cWe get Blake Snell pitching like Cy Young Blake Snell, it\u2019s going to help our whole morale in this locker room.\u201d\n\nHope is one thing, wins are another, wins in September feel like something even more. For the Rays, as the season drew near an end, as the lights fluttered to full glow, turned out a Cy Young guy was gonna walk through that door.\n\n\u201cMan,\u201d Kiermaier said, \u201cwe\u2019ve missed him like crazy the last two months. If he can be anywhere close to what he\u2019s capable of doing, we\u2019ll take that.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "In a hotly contested wild card race, the Rays welcome back Cy Young winner Blake Snell just in time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8R4K.Gj7d58_nTbVZDOLGg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04ODIuMTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/juM2YQS2MT6p1ulvY0ta5Q--~B/aD0yNTY1O3c9MzcyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/dcf6efb0-d9cb-11e9-bf3b-7742965003f2", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
