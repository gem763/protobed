Givenchy, on Sunday night, introduced jeans repurposed from old stock, a significant first step for a couture house better known for princesses, from Audrey to Meghan Markle.\n\nBut what about Herm\u00e8s, whose legacy is, well, saddles? How does it confront the issue of sustainability and remain authentic? As its women\u2019s fashion director, Nad\u00e8ge Vanhee-Cybulski, said, \u201cIt\u2019s quite challenging today to talk about leather, and Herm\u00e8s is working in a very particular way in terms of sourcing and craftsmanship.\u201d\n\nThe answer is to make sure the designs pull their weight, that they justify every aspect of producing leather, and that the garments will be ones customers will want to keep for a lifetime. Also, there\u2019s the question of price \u2014 which in the case of climate change has it\u2019s first truly practical application: when things are made in sustainable ways, by trained craftspeople in limited quantities, they cost more and last longer.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Vanhee-Cybulski did. So far, her Herm\u00e8s show is my favorite of the spring 2020 season. Leather comprised roughly 70 percent of the collection, with the rest in double-faced knits or cashmere, cotton, and tissue-thin wool. But the leather styles had the same textural weight as the wovens and knits, and every minimalist line conveyed sensuality. We know from her previous show \u2014 particularly the one a year ago at Longchamp \u2014 that Vanhee-Cybulski loves color. This time she stuck to tones more often associated with leather \u2014 khaki, burgundy, ginger, olive, white, black \u2014 which helps account for the lack of trendiness. Every outfit was shown with the same flat, dark, almost-Roman sandal.\n\nHerm\u00e8s.\n\nBut Vanhee-Cybulski\u2019s real coup was somehow using this lightweight leather for a variety of shapes \u2014 a mini shift, coats, a black tunic based on a workman\u2019s apron, with straps in the back \u2014 that could also remain stable and not tear. To do that, she had the leather bonded with organdy. As a bonus, it feels great against your skin. There are other pieces worth calling out in this exceptional collection, like a long, black tissue-wool dress with a cape top and a kind of sailor shirt-cum-blouson (in leather) with white cotton cargo pants. It\u2019s the completeness of the vision that stays with me because it\u2019s so rare in any creative field.\n\nBefore the Givenchy show, Clare Waight-Keller talked about a dialogue she wanted to set up between her early \u201990s self, when she was a design assistant in New York (at Calvin Klein) and there was \u201ca raw, boyish energy\u201d in the streets, and the high-styled fashion coming out of Paris. That meant romantic crepe de chine blouses with distressed jeans (or boy pants), blazers with Bermudas, and some lovely, flowing print dresses that wouldn\u2019t look out of place that offers drinks and a sunset. Waight-Keller also spoke candidly about the challenges of doing up-cycled denim. \u201cIt\u2019s every layer [of the process] \u2014 the sourcing, taking it apart, the labor involved, the export issues,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes you realize how difficult it is going to be to move forward.\u201d So far, Givenchy has committed to the cause, as sustainability is an issue with more and more fashion consumers.\n\nGivenchy.

It was neither one thing nor the other \u2014 the tomboyish, downtown-girl styles drifting into the territory of Stella McCartney, and the Parisian elements missing the patrician smartness of Givenchy. The denim, ultimately, didn\u2019t make a distinctive design statement.\n\nBoth Joseph Altuzarra and Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino delivered the kind of updated looks you\u2019d expect from their brands \u2014 summery prints, a Mediterranean palette, well-cut pantsuits (in the case of Altuzarra) for working women, some fresh but restrained hints of craft, like hand-knits and lace; and Piccioli continued to give dresses an airy, relaxed volume. Though Junya Watanabe\u2019s reshaping of the trench coat might seem old hat, the designs merit closer attention \u2014 for the extraordinary precision of the collaged pieces and the papery lightness of the raincoat fabric.\n\nIn New York, I wrote that an aristocratic attitude seemed to be frisking around fashion\u2019s skirts. I didn\u2019t think that designers would take it literally; in Paris, we\u2019ve seen 18th-century panniers at Loewe, Rick Owens, Thom Browne, and, to a degree, at Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. Browne\u2019s Marie Antoinette turn included the whole aristocratic kit, including wigs. But in the spirit of the French Revolution, I wanted to lop off the silly skirts \u2014 and keep every jacket. They were divine.\n\nThom Browne.

The new opera will debut in December at the Vienna State Opera.\n\nBut forget the 18th-century, forget Orlando. It\u2019s a red herring! The collection wasn\u2019t strictly based on the book. For one thing, the transformation goes in the opposite direction: the shapes and tones begin as traditionally feminine \u2014 fat sleeves, pouffy skirts \u2014 and end in more ambiguous terrain. The final four pieces hold the clues. The simple pod shapes are gender-neutral and all rendered in black \u2014 historically, a masculine tone. And of course, the tone most identified with Comme des Gar\u00e7ons since its fashion revolution in the \u201980s when it put an army of women in black, wide-leg trouser suits.\n\nComme des Garcons.

The sharp fall of the panels frames the neckline, suggesting a minimalist evening dress. Without a doubt, it\u2019s wearable. But the line of the shoulders also implies a jacket \u2014 the foundation of Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. It is one of the most remarkable designs I\u2019ve ever seen. It clearly comes from Kawakubo\u2019s aesthetic but at the same time, it stands apart as something wholly new.\n\nDoes this final passage bode the \u201cliberation\u201d of Kawakubo herself? She has been frank in recent years about the difficulties of finding a new creative direction. Hence the sculptural pieces she has put on the runway in lieu of actual clothes. Could this be a marker?
