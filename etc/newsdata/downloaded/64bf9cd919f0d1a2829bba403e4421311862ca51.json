I should also steer clear of vaginal cannabis and \u201ccleansing\u201d myself with colloidal silver, an alternative health remedy the gynaecologist says can damage skin tissue and, when absorbed in large amounts, can turn your skin permanently blue. \u201cYeah, don\u2019t do that,\u201d she deadpans over the phone from New York.\n\nGunter\u2019s advice might sound strange. But in January, there were reports that women were inserting parsley into their vaginas in order to bring on their periods. The claim was swiftly debunked, but several others followed, warning women against inserting everything from garlic to ice lollies inside themselves, either to treat infections or simply \"cool down\".\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a cartoon,\u201d Gunter says. \u201cThat\u2019s how much of a joke it is medically, and yet people believe this stuff and you can\u2019t change it.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

She is one of the many medical professionals advising women not to listen to the aforementioned vaginal mythology, which she says comes from feminist manuals written in the 1970s, whose non-medical advice has resurfaced online. In her new book, The Vagina Bible, Gunter confronts these and other misconceptions surrounding female sexual health.\n\n\u201cWomen don\u2019t randomly stick vegetable matter up their vagina, someone has told them to do it,\u201d Gunter explains, adding that while the authors of these books might\u2019ve had women\u2019s best interests at heart, they didn\u2019t necessarily have the medical background to be dishing out gynaecological advice. \u201cThere\u2019s almost no information about the safety of these things for your vaginal health.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 14 women using social media to change the world Show all 14 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

What followed was a viral social media campaign, #1000blackgirlbooks, calling for titles featuring black girls as protagonists to be donated. Nearly 4,000 books were donated, and Dias now tackles prejudice and advocates for diversity in literature. Getty 2/14 Rina Sawayama @rinasonline Rina Sawayama came in a blaze of neon and sci-fi coolness in early 2016 when she released the single 'Where U Are', which explored how humans interact with digital media. Since then, the singer and model from north London has been a trailblazer for intersectional feminism. Whether it\u2019s singing about her experiences as a pansexual woman or starting Twitter conversations about cultural appropriation in the media, Sawayama has taken both the music world and social media by storm with her politically vibrant work. A quick look at her Instagram account (@rinasonline) will reveal a confident woman who is not afraid to voice her opinions to her 141,000 followers. Getty 3/14 Chidera Eggerue @theslumflower At only 24 years old, Eggerue came to prominence with her viral 2017 social media campaign #SaggyBoobsMatter. 'It was only small-boobed women who were \u2018allowed\u2019 to not wear a bra,' the author said in an interview with The Guardian. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why \u2026 I had to challenge it.\u201d Her decision to not wear a bra shouldn\u2019t be deemed radical, yet here she is in 2019 challenging the ideas that women are pressured to confirming too. Women of all ages and shapes use the hashtag to show pride in themselves, as a result of the body positivity Eggerue championed. Her blog, The Slumflower, also discusses sexism, feminism and racism. Getty Images 4/14 Scarlett Curtis @scarcurtis You may know her as the writer who exposed Philip Green\u2019s willingness to profit off feminism but reject the idea of having a pink pop-up stall in Topshop back in October 2018. However, Scarlett Curtis is a trail-blazing feminist in other ways too. The author of Feminists Don\u2019t Wear Pink & Other Lies co-founded The Pink Protest \u2013 a collective helping young feminist activist to take action online \u2013 in 2017, all while using her social media to challenge misogyny whenever she encounters it. Getty 5/14 Tarana Burke @TaranaBurke Also known as the mother of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke is an American social activist who is largely responsible for the international movement against sexual harassment that went viral in October 2017. The phrase was first used in 2006 on Burke\u2019s Myspace account after she responded to a 13-year-old girl who had been sexually assaulted. The hashtag gained traction after actress Alyssa Milano encouraged victims of harassment to tweet the phrase. The call-out followed sexual abuse allegations against disgraced film producter Harvey Weinstein and has been used at least 19 million times on social media. Burke is a life-long activist for victims of sexual assault and harassment and continues to campaign such issues on social media. She has single-handedly changed the conversation on sexual violence. Getty 6/14 Sophie Sandberg @catcallsofnyc Tired of being unable to walk down the street without being constantly catcalled by men, activist Sophie Sandberg took to Instagram to expose an epidemic rife in society. Armed with multi-coloured chalk, she began documenting the horrific words that had been said to her all over New York in late 2016. Talking to the BBC about the project she stated: 'By writing [catcalls] in the same place that it happened, I hope the words may remember and think \"Oh those were my words\".' Women around the globe have been inspired by Sandberg\u2019s work and Instagram accounts of women chalking messages have since sprung up from Columbia to Bangladesh. Sophie Sandberg 7/14 Hannah Witton @hannahwitton Hannah Witton is a sex-positive YouTuber and author who has vlogged candidly about sexual health, relationships and women\u2019s issues since 2011. Over the years, the Mancunian has amassed over 500,000 subscribers. Witton is inspirationally confident and isn\u2019t afraid of talking about her sex life to her thousands of subscribers in videos such as 'How Many People Have I Slept With?' and 'The Benefits of Porn'. The vlogger is also a champion for body positivity (her most viewed video with over 8 million views is about the struggles of large boobs) and invisible illnesses \u2013 as she herself suffers from ulcerative colitis and proudly wears a stoma. Getty 8/14 Adwoa Aboah @adwoaaboah British model Adwoa Aboah is no stranger to the crippling effect of depression having suffered from it herself. This is why the star established the mental health community Gurls Talk. It began in 2015 with an Instagram account and now serves as a place to discuss topics affecting women without any fear of judgement. It has since grown into a weekly podcast and a series of organised events that have brought women together from across the globe. Talking to the BBC about the project, Aboah noted: 'At school there still isn\u2019t a place for girls and boys to realise they\u2019re not alone \u2026There is a light at the end of the tunnel. I promise that.' Getty 9/14 Laci Green @gogreen18 YouTuber Laci Green has been educating her subscribers on the nuances of sex education for over 10 years and has amassed over 1.4 million subscribers. The vlogger's videos, which are prominent in the sex-positive movement due to their candour, cover topics such as birth control, hormones and abortion in an attempt to remove the stigma surrounding them. Green is also very outspoken against slut-shaming and sexual harassment, being one of the first YouTubers to address the sexual harassment claims levied against vlogger Sam Pepper in 2014. Getty 10/14 Ash Sarkar @AyoCaesar From describing broadcaster Piers Morgan an 'idiot' to declaring herself a communist on Good Morning Britain, Ash Sarkar is a dynamic journalist making waves on the internet and TV. The north London native champions the rights of women and immigrants on social media, with a Twitter account that is rife with political commentary with a humorous edge. Meanwhile, her Instagram showcases all her campaigning work including protests on climate change and Brexit. Sarkar is also a senior editor at Novara Media \u2013 an independent, radical left-wing news organisation. Ash Sarkar 11/14 Gina Martin @ginamartin Writer and activist Gina Martin hit national headlines when she began a viral campaign to make 'upskirting' illegal. Taking to Facebook, Martin explained how a man took photos of her crotch without her permission and got away with it in a post that subsequently went viral in 2017. She then launched a petition for her case to be reopened and for the action to be made part of the 2003 Sexual Offences Act. Using the hashtag, #StopSkirtingTheIssue, the petition managed to get over 100,000 signatures. As of 2019, 'upskirting' is now illegal and this is largely down to the efforts of Martin. The activist continues to promote feminist causes to her 40,000 Instagram followers. AFP 12/14 Rowan Blanchard @rowanblanchard When Rowan Blanchard isn\u2019t taking over the world of acting, she\u2019s taking to Twitter and Instagram to talk to her 5.1 million followers about various activist pursuits. The 17-year-old uses her platform to discuss social and economic issues, with topics as diverse as human rights and gun control, and isn\u2019t afraid to give a voice to those who haven\u2019t been heard. Blanchard was very vocal in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas shootings earlier this year, talking with activists and highlighting their plight on social media.

In the last few years, she has become one of the most renowned voices on women\u2019s health, known for her outspoken criticism of the wellness industry and her eviscerating Twitter takedowns of Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s lifestyle brand Goop. But Gunter\u2019s concerns regarding obscure vaginal cleansing trends, either by way of a steam or a Greek yoghurt, don't just stem from pseudo-science; telling women to detoxify themselves is fundamentally sexist. \u201cThe fact that people are profiting from the idea that a woman\u2019s reproductive tract is dirty and filled with toxins is really the core tenet of the patriarchy,\u201d she says.\n\nVaginal steaming, which has previously been recommended as a spa treatment by Goop, recently hit the headlines after one woman tried to conduct a steam herself at home and ended up with third-degree burns. \"The whole basis of vaginal steaming is to cleanse the toxins from your uterus, but that\u2019s not possible,\u201d Gunter explains. \u201cThere are no toxins in there. If there were, how would a baby grow? It\u2019s just common sense.\u201d\n\nThe increasing use of vaginal astringents (which dry the vagina) is just as concerning, she says, describing them as a \u201cchemical chastity belt\u201d. \u201cThey can make sex a really uncomfortable experience for women and can be a way of controlling someone\u2019s sexuality, because maybe there\u2019s some men who get off from sex being a painful experience. It\u2019s really sad to see that people are still recommending it.\u201d\n\nIn early 2017, Gunter wrote an open letter to Paltrow after a Goop article touted the benefits of vaginal jade eggs. Gunter described the product as \u201ca hot mess\u201d and a group of district attorneys from California soon filed a lawsuit against the company, which stated that the assertions made on the site were unfounded. Goop agreed to pay a settlement of $145,000 (\u00a3112,514).\n\nGunter\u2019s specific issue with Goop\u2019s marketing of the jade eggs was that a post on the website claimed \u201cqueens and concubines used them to stay in shape for emperors\". She made fun of the statement in her blog at the time, writing: \u201cNothing says female empowerment more than the only reason to do this is for your man!\u201d\n\nReflecting on the incident, Gunter argues that today\u2019s wellness sites are \u201cselling patriarchy but wrapping it up and calling it feminism\u201d. They are also capitalising on fear, she says. \u201cMost things advocated in the commercial wellness industry aren\u2019t going to help you at all. Going for a walk is good for you, so is using sun cream. But those things are hard to monetise because they\u2019re boring. You need fear to sell products, and so toxins appear wherever you need them.\u201d\n\nIn The Vagina Bible, Gunter tries to dismantle some of the common misconceptions about vaginal health, touching on everything from what kind of underwear women should be wearing (spoiler: whichever kind you want) and vaginoplasty. \u201cI want to be the internet\u2019s medical librarian and tell them \u2018Hey, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re searching for information, but you should know that people selling products are not good librarians, neither is someone who makes radical claims.\u201d\n\nInstead, Gunter urges anyone seeking medical information to look to professional organisations such as the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the NHS in the UK. \u201cIf you start your search in a place that\u2019s accurate, you\u2019re going to be armed against any misinformation,\u201d she explains.\n\nBut Gunter has another ambition for her book beyond education: addressing the stigma that surrounds female sexuality and anatomy.\n\nLast month, her US publisher, Kensington Books, accused Twitter of censoring promotion of her book on the platform because it had the word \u201cvagina\u201d in it. In a tweet addressed to Twitter\u2019s founder, Jack Dorsey, Gunter wrote: \u201cDear @Jack, vagina is an anatomical term and not a \u2018dirty\u2019 word.\u201d Kensington Books later told The Independent that the tweet was initially rejected for \u201cinappropriate language\u201d but \u201cnow [Twitter] are saying they\u2019ll let us pay to promote it\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo many women I know can\u2019t even describe their own anatomy,\u201d Gunter says. \u201cI see women in the office and they can only say \u2018down there\u2019. I hope that in a few years everyone can say the word vagina and it will carry the same weight as the word elbow. I really feel that if we could dispel the myth that women\u2019s bodies are so toxic and dirty that you can\u2019t even say the word \u2018vagina\u2019, so many of the issues I touch on in the book would fall away.\u201d\n\nThe Vagina Bible: The vulva and the vagina \u2013 separating the myth from the medicine by Dr Jen Gunter is out now.", "description": "Dr Jen Gunter is explaining why I shouldn\u2019t put parsley inside my vagina.
