Symptoms include headaches, fever, vomiting, drowsiness, convulsions and coma. About a third of EEE cases lead to death.Those who do survive are often left with permanent physical and neurological damage, ranging from seizures and paralysis to personality disorders and intellectual impairment.\n\nThe disease is most common in spring and autumn during years with mild winters, which has made some scientists worry that climate change will make it more common as the planet warms and becomes more hospitable to mosquitoes.\n\nHealth officials recommend taking precautions such as using bug spray and wearing long sleeves and trousers. Health officials in Michigan are also encouraging residents to cancel or move outdoor activities during dusk or nighttime hours while the outbreak persists.", "description": "A man was\u00a0left brain dead by a rare mosquito-borne illness just nine days after contracting it, and later died.
