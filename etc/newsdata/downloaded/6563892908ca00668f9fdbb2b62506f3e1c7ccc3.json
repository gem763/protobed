Why should I go?\u2019: Mostly empty stadium hosts Robert Mugabe funeral", "language": "en", "text": "Members of the public sit in the stands during the state funeral for former president Robert Mugabe: AP\n\nAfrican leaders praised Zimbabwe\u2019s former president Robert Mugabe as a hero during a poorly-attended funeral at the country\u2019s National Sports Stadium.\n\nMore than 10 African leaders and several former presidents attended the service for Mugabe, who died last week in Singapore aged 95, but the crowd filled only about 30 per cent of the 60,000 capacity stadium in Harare.\n\nCyril Ramaphosa, South Africa\u2019s president, also drew boos from the crowd, after recent xenophobic attacks on foreigners, including Zimbabweans in Johannesburg.\n\nKenya\u2019s president Uhuru Kenyatta described Mugabe as \u201ca great icon of African liberation\u201d, though many Zimbabweans showed little interest in the funeral.\n\nAlthough the funeral was open to the public, some complained about the cost of travelling to the event.\n\n\u201cWe are happier now that he is gone. Why should I go to his funeral? I don\u2019t have fuel,\u201d a Harare resident told the Agence France-Presse news agency. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to hear anything about him anymore. He is the cause of our problems.\u201d\n\nAnother, Amos Siduna, added: \u201cI didn\u2019t like him, but I still wanted to attend just to see for myself that he is gone... but kombis [minivan taxis] want $3.50 just to get to the stadium. That\u2019s too much money for me just to go and say \u2018bye bye\u2019 to a corpse. Mugabe\u2019s corpse. No.\u201d\n\nAmelia Tukande, who was selling mobile phone chargers near the stadium, added: \u201cWhat will I get if I go there? What will Mugabe do for me now that he failed to do when he was alive? It is a waste of time. I have to work for my family.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nRobert Mugabe: The Zimbabwean leader who lost touch with his people\n\nThe funeral was attended by some supporters of the former president, who led a bitter guerrilla war to end white-minority rule in the country when it was known as Rhodesia.\n\nSupporters of Zimbabwe\u2019s ruling Zanu-PF party also attended.\n\nVisiting leaders viewed Mugabe\u2019s partially-open casket, after which there was a 21-gun salute, a flypast by Zimbabwean air force jets and the release of 95 doves, marking his 95 years.\n\nMugabe\u2019s body will be viewed in his birthplace, Zvimba, on Sunday and then held in preservation until a new mausoleum can be built for his remains.\n\nThis will be built near the stadium at Heroes\u2019 Acre, a national burial site for top officials of the Zanu-PF party who contributed towards ending white colonial rule.\n\nMugabe was deposed in 2017 by a military coup and replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa, his once trusted deputy.\n\nMr Mnangagwa won elections in 2018 by promising to improve the country\u2019s faltering economy and create jobs.\n\nHowever, Zimbabwe\u2019s economy has since lurched from crisis to crisis, with the past two years marked by rising prices and inflation at more than 175 per cent.\n\nIn the stadium, some attendees sang an impromptu farewell to Mugabe with the lyrics: \u201cWhen you left, bread was a dollar.\u201d\n\nOne of the crowd members, Munashe Gudyanga, explained: \u201cBread was less than a dollar when we marched against him [Mugabe]. It is now $9. I am just here to say, \u2018Sorry President Mugabe, we didn\u2019t know things will be worse.\u2019\u201d\n\nAgencies contributed to this report\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Robert Mugabe: The Zimbabwean leader who lost touch with his people\n\nMugabe to be buried on hilltop reserved for Zimbabwe\u2019s national heroes\n\nAfter leading Zimbabwe to freedom, Robert Mugabe then tore it apart\n\nMugabe\u2019s rule led us to dismiss nationalism, but that was a mistake\n\nAfricans still love Robert Mugabe, but Zimbabwe deserved better\n\nMugabe\u2019s farm seizures: Racial justice or catastrophic power grab?", "description": "African leaders praised Zimbabwe\u2019s former president Robert Mugabe as a hero during a poorly-attended funeral at the country\u2019s National Sports Stadium.More than 10 African leaders and several former presidents attended the service for Mugabe, who died last week in Singapore aged 95, but the crowd filled", "authors": ["Conrad Duncan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/y2cWnvMyrMQV7EPutcrPmg--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/76d2cbfb4f4cb75fe42efb8bf089d549", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
