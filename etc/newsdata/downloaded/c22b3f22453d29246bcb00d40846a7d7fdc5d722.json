Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, a key ally of U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party, said it remained opposed to the draft agreement.\n\n\"It remains to be seen whether the reaction is short-lived as the politicians go toe-to-toe again at the weekend, but in the meantime the very possibility of an agreed outcome to the painful Brexit saga has resulted in a relief rally, both financial and psychological,\" said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. stocks have reacted positively overall to the start of third-quarter earnings reporting season.\n\n\"Even though it is very early in the Q3 earnings reporting period, investors have been encouraged by the better-than-expected results for the large diversified banks and selected health care companies,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, in a note.\n\nThat enthusiasm was offset Wednesday by weaker-than-expected September retail sales numbers, while uncertainty around U.S.-China trade talks continues to cast a cloud over the market. Overall, the potential for elevated volatility is expected to remain a concern for investors since October has recorded nearly 40% higher volatility than the other 11 months since World War 2, Stovall said, noting CFRA still expects to see share prices end the year higher on an improvement in earnings per share expectations.\n\nOn the trade front, Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesman U.S. and Chinese negotiators are still working out the text of a so-called \"phase 1\" trade agreement that led to the U.S. postponing a tariff increase that had been set for Tuesday in exchange for promises by the Chinese to increase agricultural purchases. The White House said that the deal would involve agricultural purchases of between $40 to $50 billion annually, but Gao declined to confirm that number, according to Bloomberg (link).\n\nThe news follows a Wednesday pledge (link) by Senator Jim Risch, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to take up a bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives that would require the State Department to annually review Hong Kong's autonomy from mainland China and potentially end Hong Kong's special status that shields it from tariffs, visa restrictions and other barriers imposed on the rest of China.
