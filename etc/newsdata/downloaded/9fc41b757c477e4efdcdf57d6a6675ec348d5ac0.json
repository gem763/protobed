Most of the dead were civilians, including women and children, though six were security force members.\n\nThe Taliban said it carried out the two attacks, and a statement issued by a spokesman for the insurgents said they were aimed at security forces.\n\n\"People were given warning,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Do not take part in the puppet administration's election rallies, because all such gatherings are our military target,\" said the statement. \"If, despite the warning, someone get hurt, they themselves are to blame.\"\n\nAddressing the Kabul attack, Afghanistan's president lashed out at the Taliban as the \"coward enemy\" for targeting civilians.\n\n\"I offer my heartfelt condolences to victims of today's tragedies in Kabul and Parwan and pray for speedy recovery of those who were wounded,\" Ghani wrote on his official Twitter account. \"We stand united in this hour of grief.\"\n\nPakistan, which denies accusations that it shelters the Taliban, also condemned the attack.\n\n\"We offer our heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families,\" it said in a statement.\n\nSecurity at rallies across the country has been tight following threats by the Taliban to attack meetings and polling stations. The group has vowed to intensify clashes with Afghan and foreign forces to dissuade people from voting in the upcoming elections.\n\nLast week, peace talks between the United States and the Taliban collapsed. The two sides had been seeking to reach an accord on the withdrawal of thousands of American troops from Afghanistan in exchange for security guarantees from the insurgents.\n\nThe negotiations, which did not include the Afghan government, were intended as a prelude to wider peace negotiations to end more than more 40 years of war in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Abdul Qadir Sediqi, Hameed Farzad, Hamid Shalizi; Writing by Paul Carsten; Editing by William Maclean and Alex Richardson)", "description": "Taliban suicide bombers killed 48 people in two separate attacks in Afghanistan on Tuesday, the deadliest taking place near an election rally by President Ashraf Ghani, though he was unhurt.
