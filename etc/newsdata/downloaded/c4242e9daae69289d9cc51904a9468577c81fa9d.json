But for his next display, Bell is going indoors at Mount Pleasant\u2019s intimate Lost Origins Gallery. \u201cRefractions\u201d still features Bell\u2019s usual array of lights and projections, tailor-made for the location, but for the first time, there will also be printed pictures of Bell\u2019s iconic works. 7 to 10 p.m. Weekends through Oct. 27. Free.\n\nAD\n\nAutumn Evenings at the Hirshhorn: The Hirshhorn knows that the best time for outdoor museum events is not the summer but the fall \u2014 even if the weather has not been sympathetic to autumn-admirers. The modern art museum extends hours until 8:30 p.m. this Friday and next to highlight their outstanding latest exhibits. This week\u2019s focus will be the outstanding \u201cManifesto: Art x Agency,\u201d which runs through January and features more than 100 artist manifestos created over the past 100 years. 5 to 8:30 p.m. Free.\n\n\u2018Fleabag\u2019 at the Shakespeare Theatre Company: Did you just finish binge-watching \u201cFleabag\u201d after it won multiple Emmys, including best comedy series? Fans new and old will have a chance to catch a theatrical screening of Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s one-woman stage show, which earned rave reviews in London and New York City \u2014 and inspired the popular TV series.

The Fort Belvoir Oktoberfest, which runs through Sunday, features a carnival midway on the base\u2019s parade field with games, a Ferris wheel and other rides; a beer garden; German and American food and drink; and live German music. It\u2019s open to the public (IDs required) Friday from 4 to 11. Red Bear Brewing, meanwhile, marks its first three-day \u201cOktoBEARfest\u201d with the release of three German-style beers \u2014 a m\u00e4rzen, a hefeweizen and a dry-hopped pilsner \u2014 and Friday\u2019s opening night brings a special edition of the drag competition Slay Them, beginning at 9 p.m.\n\nAD\n\nScience of Speech at the Fillmore Silver Spring: Jay-Z once rapped, \u201cIf skills sold, truth be told, I\u2019d probably be lyrically Talib Kweli.\u201d That backhanded compliment has, in a way, defined the Brooklyn MC\u2019s two-decade-plus career as a flame carrier for so-called lyrical or conscious hip-hop. While mostly out of the mainstream for as long as he\u2019s been rapping, the style will be on display as part of the well-titled \u201cScience of Speech\u201d tour. Alongside Kweli, the bill includes Yonkers veteran Styles P, outspoken political duo Dead Prez and rap\u2019s leading recluse, Jay Electronica, for a concert where lyrical skill will be the coin of the realm. 8 p.m. $35.\n\nMeute at the Lincoln Memorial: Meute is a German marching band that plays arrangements of popular techno songs on traditional marching band instruments. There\u2019s really nothing more to their gimmick than that, except they\u2019re so tight \u2014 check out their versions of Disclosure and Eliza Doolittle\u2019s \u201cYou & Me (Flume Remix),\u201d which has more than 24 million views on YouTube, or Trentem\u00f8ller\u2019s \u201cMiss You.\u201d The group performs at the Lincoln Memorial at noon Friday at an event arranged by the German Embassy as a way to celebrate German Unity Day (Oct. 3) and German-American Friendship Day (Oct. 6). Noon. Free.\n\nAD\n\nImani Winds at Gildenhorn Recital Hall of the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center: For more than two decades, Imani Winds, founded by the composer and flutist Valerie Coleman, has been unfolding different perspectives in its concerts, juxtaposing Bach with John Coltrane, playing Stravinsky and Jason Moran, riding a lonely path as one of the few ensembles made up of musicians of color in a very white field. \u201cA Woman\u2019s Perspective\u201d is the title of Imani Winds\u2019s program at the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center on Friday. It features pieces by composers you should have heard of \u2014 including Ruth Crawford Seeger, a major voice of American modernism who after her marriage saw her work fall into neglect, and Coleman herself. 8 p.m. $10-$25.\n\nAD\n\n[Why don\u2019t we hear more music by women? The Imani Winds quintet is trying to change that.]\n\nSaturday, Oct. 5\n\nAD\n\nBring the Funk: A Natural Wine Party at Colony Club: Aiming to demystify the often confusing world of natural wine, D.C. wine distributors Plant Wines and Native Selections and retailer Domestique have joined forces for an afternoon of sipping in the spacious courtyard behind Colony Club, Sonny\u2019s and No Kisses. Expect to learn what makes a wine \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cminimalist\u201d while tasting 15 samples from producers hailing from Europe and the Americas. (Colony Club\u2019s Max Zimmerman says attendees will also get to enjoy a larger pour or two of their favorites at the end.) Beyond what\u2019s in the souvenir tasting glass, look for snacks ranging from popcorn to charcuterie, and a DJ spinning funk and old-school tunes to keep the party from feeling like the usual wine tasting. 1 to 5 p.m. $40.\n\nAD\n\n[12 of the best things to see, drink and do in the D.C. area in October]\n\nOktoberfest events at various locations: In addition to the continuing festivities at Fort Belvoir and Red Bear (see Friday listings above), there\u2019s more German spirit to be found throughout the area. The Vienna Oktoberfest, which can draw more than 20,000 people, offers a beer garden, multiple music stages, a German auto show, and market with local makers on historic Church Street. The fun runs from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., and admission is free. Rustico\u2019s Oktoberfest, held on the patio of its Alexandria location from noon to 5 p.m., features seasonal beers both local (Port City) and from Germany (including Ayinger and Rothaus), as well as German-style food. And at Wunder Garten in NoMa, which is winding down its extended Oktoberfest celebrations this weekend, the day starts early with a screening of the Bayern Munich-Hoffenheim match at 9 a.m., then there\u2019s live music (noon to 4 p.m.), a \u201cBavarian Olympics\u201d with stein-holding competitions from 4 to 7, followed by a DJ until close.\n\nAD\n\nArt on the Avenue in Alexandria: On the first Saturday of October, thousands of locals descend upon the Alexandria community of Del Ray to explore and celebrate the world of art. The diverse selection of 300 artists with works for sale includes the expected potters, woodworkers and photographers, but also silversmiths and sculptors. An array of neighborhood restaurants set up street service for the day, such as Del Ray Pizzeria and Evening Star Cafe \u2014 while visiting vendors set up shop in a food court field. As you stroll along the avenue, live music plays across four stages throughout the day. 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free.\n\nAD\n\nPrince George\u2019s Fall Fest at Bowie Town Center: This annual celebration fills Bowie Town Center with vendors, free wine tastings, games and, more importantly, a pair of stages where a dozen local blues, funk and R&B bands perform throughout the day. It\u2019s not a surprise that music is the focus: The festival is organized by the same group that arranges Bowie\u2019s free summerlong concert series, and proceeds from the event benefit a charity that supplies instruments to students. 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free.\n\nPop-up pumpkin patch at Ballston Quarter: If you can\u2019t make it out to a nice, scenic farm to pick up your pumpkin, head toward Ballston for your gourd fix. For $5 (cash only), you can snag a pumpkin and decorate it at the recently renovated Arlington mall. There will be live music and refreshments served throughout the day, but it\u2019s also a great excuse to check out the food hall that opened in the basement, which features spots such as Hot Lola\u2019s and Sloppy Mama\u2019s. Or for those without little ones to worry about, the massive Punch Bowl Social is worth a look for post-pumpkin picking drinks and games. 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free admission.\n\nAD\n\nTaciturn at Songbyrd: If you descend into the rowhouse basement where the members of Taciturn regularly jam new songs into existence and ask them how they do it, the D.C. noise-punk trio will instinctively jam toward a collective answer. \u201cIt\u2019s meditative,\u201d bassist-singer Natasha Janfaza says. \u201cA song can be really chaotic, but it\u2019s still meditative.\u201d So the idea is to sink into the depths of your own head until everyone merges into some kind of rock-and-roll group mind? Maybe something like that. \u201cWe\u2019re each beating paths, and then something just works,\u201d drummer Kevin Ralph says. \u201cYou have to lose yourself in the intricacies of it.\u201d 9 p.m. $8.\n\nAD\n\n[Taciturn is making ambiguous mood music at high volumes]\n\nSunday, Oct. 6\n\nAD\n\nTakoma Park Street Festival: The Takoma Park Street Festival is almost four decades old, and few large street festivals capture the spirit of a community as well. The half-mile of Carroll Avenue between the D.C. line and East-West Highway is filled with a quirky mix of hundreds of booths run by artists, gardeners, crafters, yoga studios, all-natural apothecaries, the Masons and the Boy Scouts. Reggae, blues and Afrobeat bands play from three stages all day. Kids can get their faces painted, make arts and crafts, and jump on bouncy castles while adults participating in \u201cThe Crawl\u201d can duck into restaurants and bars, filling their eco-conscious reusable mugs with craft beer, wine, green tea or horchata. Vegan restaurants, art galleries and vintage stores are open. It\u2019s Takoma Park, ramped up to \u201c10,\u201d and it\u2019s not to be missed. 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free; \u201cThe Crawl\u201d mug is $10.\n\nAD\n\nD.C. Craft Bartenders Guild Tiki Competition and Pig Roast at Archipelago: Yes, summer is over, and many drinkers\u2019 thoughts are turning to mulled wine or hard cider. But the D.C. Craft Bartenders Guild\u2019s annual throwdown is an excuse to put on that Hawaiian-print shirt or sailor\u2019s cap one more time. Eight bartenders from some of the city\u2019s best cocktail bars, including Quill, a Rake\u2019s Progress and Bourbon Steak, are whipping up tiki-inspired cocktails and punches while chef Adam Greenberg of Coconut Club serves up a whole roast pig. Admission includes unlimited food and drink, and the best-dress guest wins tickets to December\u2019s Repeal Day Ball. Noon to 5 p.m. $60.\n\nOktoberfest events at various locations: This is the final day for Oktoberfests at Fort Belvoir, Red Bear Brewing, Dacha Beer Garden and Wunder Garten. The NoMa beer garden has branded Sunday \u201cDogtoberfest,\u201d complete with a canine costume contest (2 p.m.) and live music and DJs from noon to 11 p.m.\n\nAD\n\nSteve Lacy at 9:30 Club: For music obsessives who still comb liner notes, Steve Lacy is increasingly a name behind the scenes of the most significant songs and albums in R&B, rap and pop. The 21-year-old Compton, Calif., native started making beats on his iPhone and eventually hooked up with the Internet, the neo-neo-soulsters that spun off from Odd Future. He\u2019s since collaborated with Kendrick Lamar, Solange, Vampire Weekend and Kali Uchis, among others, before striking out on his own with this year\u2019s \u201cApollo XXI,\u201d a genre-agnostic exploration of what he can do when left to his own devices. 7 p.m. Sold out.\n\n-- Hau Chu, Fritz Hahn, Chris Kelly, Anne Midgette and Chris Richards", "description": "Check out Oktoberfest celebrations, a new exhibit from D.C. artist Robin Bell and an outdoor natural wine party.", "authors": ["Going Out Guide Staff"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GUT7Z9n0hqi7w0FA2kPQjgYbcNU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GWEM6DXESQI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
