'Despite this, terrorists carried out a total of 14 attacks in the last 36 hours.'\n\nFire and smoke rising from the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain in Turkey's military operation against Kurdish forces on Friday\n\nThe ministry said 12 of the attacks came from Ras al-Ain in northeastern Syria, one from Tal Abyad and another from Tal Tamr region, adding that various light and heavy weaponry including rockets were used.\n\nTurkey had agreed to suspend its Syria offensive on Thursday but Erdogan has warned he would resume a full-scale operation against Kurdish forces if they do not withdraw from a border 'safe zone.'\n\nThe truce sets out a five-day pause to let the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces militia pull out of a 'safe zone' Turkey has vowed to create in territory extending more than 20 miles deep into Syria.\n\n'If the promises are kept until Tuesday evening, the safe zone issue will be resolved. If it fails, the operation... will start the minute 120 hours are over,' Erdogan said.\n\nHe added that the agreement was holding and there had been no issues so far.\n\nOn Saturday, calm appeared to be prevailing in Ras al-Ain with no signs of fighting, reports on the Turkish side of the border claimed.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Turkey-backed Syrian fighters had prevented a medical convoy from reaching Ras al-Ayn on Friday.\n\nAnkara regards the YPG, the SDF's main Kurdish component, a terrorist group because of its links to Kurdish insurgents operating in southeast Turkey.\n\nA Turkish-backed Syrian fighter sits on the side of the street in the town of Ayn al-Arus, south of the border town of Tal Abyad\n\n'The Turkish armed forces fully abides by the agreement' reached on Thursday with the United States, the defence ministry said in a statement\n\nThe five-day ceasefire was agreed on Thursday after Donald Trump dispatched Vice President Mike Pence to Ankara to end to the bloodshed - and a deal was announced that would see Turkey stop its attack while Kurdish forces withdraw from the border.\n\nWhile Kurdish leadership agreed to the deal it was far from clear whether individual armed militias - who fought and died to claim the territory from ISIS - would willingly hand it over to Erdogan.\n\nOn Friday, smoke billowed over Ras al-Ayn as gunfire and shelling could be heard inside the city, though it was unclear who was firing at whom.\n\nThe ceasefire had earlier been praised by Trump, who said it would save 'millions of lives,' while Turkey cast it as a complete victory.\n\nIf implemented, the deal would achieve all the main objectives Turkey announced when it launched its assault on October 9: control of a strip of Syria more than 20 miles deep, with the SDF forces agreed to pull out.\n\nRepublican and Democratic senators have accused Trump of having betrayed the Kurdish allies who were vital in fighting Islamic State militants, of brushing aside the humanitarian costs of Turkey's invasion and of being outwitted by Ankara.\n\nIt was unclear what if any damage came from the shelling heard on Friday.\n\nThe five-day ceasefire was agreed on Thursday after Donald Trump dispatched Vice President Mike Pence to Ankara to end to the bloodshed (Pictured: Pence and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan)\n\nIt was also unclear whether the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) would fully comply with the agreement, which would leave Turkish forces in charge of a swathe of territory that the Kurds once held with US military support.\n\nMazloum Abdi, the commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, told Kurdish TV late on Thursday: 'We will do whatever we can for the success of the ceasefire agreement.'\n\nBut one Kurdish official, Razan Hiddo, declared that the Kurdish people would refuse to live under Turkish occupation.\n\nTrump framed the US-brokered ceasefire deal with Turkey as 'a great day for civilisation' but its effect was largely to mitigate a foreign policy crisis widely seen to be of his own making.\n\nSpeaking at a rally in Dallas on Thursday, the US president said he allowed Turkish and Kurdish forces to clash in deadly battles because the two sides were like children who needed to fight each other.\n\n'It was unconventional what I did. I said they're going to have to fight a little while,' Trump said. 'Like two kids in a lot, you have got to let them fight and then you pull them apart.\n\n'They fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious.'\n\nMore than 500 people have been killed including dozens of civilians, mostly on the Kurdish side, and 300,000 civilians have been displaced within Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor.", "description": "The ministry said 12 attacks came from Ras al-Ain in Syria, one from Tal Abyad and another from Tal Tamr, adding that various light and heavy weaponry including rockets were used.", "authors": ["Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/11/19918274-0-image-a-41_1571480548287.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
