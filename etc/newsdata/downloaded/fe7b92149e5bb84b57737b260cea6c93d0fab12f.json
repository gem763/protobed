This time, Alastair Mactaggart has crafted a ballot initiative that would be even tougher on companies that collect broad swaths of personal information.\n\n\u201cPeople are really hungry for more, not less, privacy protection,\u201d Mactaggart told MarketWatch.\n\nThe California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020 is essentially an amendment to the landmark California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which is scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nMactaggart\u2019s latest would grant consumers more control over what he calls \u201csensitive personal information\u201d such as a person\u2019s race, health, Social Security number and recent locations using GPS technology. If passed into law, consumers would have the right to prevent such data from being sold or used for advertising purposes. The proposal includes the creation of a five-member state agency to enforce privacy protections.\n\nFrom WSJ: The real-estate developer who took on the tech giants\n\nThe new ballot initiative, in large measure, is \u201cabout what we couldn\u2019t get in\u201d CCPA, state Sen. Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, acknowledged to MarketWatch in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad this (law) was viewed through interest-group lenses, and not for the public good. Everyone got into their corners.\u201d\n\nSee now: California\u2019s landmark privacy law: What it does, what has changed and what it means for investors\n\nCompanies that improperly share and sell health and financial data of children younger than 16, for instance, would face stiff penalties under the November 2020 statewide ballot measure submitted last Wednesday by Mactaggart\u2019s nonprofit organization, Californians for Consumer Privacy. In practice, the latest ballot measure is an amendment to CCPA that would go into effect Jan. 1, 2021.\n\n\u201cThere are many things in this initiative that would advance consumer privacy,\u201d Adam Schwartz, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said in an email to MarketWatch, though he added that some parts of the initiative draft \u201cgive us concern, such as the lack of a true private right of action for all violations.\u201d\n\nThough Mactaggart considers CCPA a \u201cgreat baseline,\u201d he emphasized state residents need even stronger privacy protection following disclosures of Facebook Inc.\u2019s FB, -0.98% entanglement with British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica during the 2016 presidential election, and a security breach at credit-reporting bureau Equifax Inc. EFX, -1.89% that exposed the information of 147 million people.\n\nSee also: Victims of the Equifax data breach won\u2019t be eligible for settlement unless they meet these criteria\n\nAt the same time, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission have launched investigations into the considerable business influence of Facebook, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, -2.61% GOOG, -2.53% Google, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.65%, and Apple Inc. AAPL, -2.36%, all of whom depend on data to fuel their operations.\n\nHertzberg, who is Senate Majority Leader, credited Mactaggart for giving it another go -- particularly in pursuing the creation of a data-privacy protection agency.\n\n\u201cCongress is not doing anything,\u201d he said, echoing a complaint among privacy advocates. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see California do the right thing, and set an example for other states and the nation.\u201d", "description": "The real-estate magnate behind California\u2019s landmark privacy law is at it again.
