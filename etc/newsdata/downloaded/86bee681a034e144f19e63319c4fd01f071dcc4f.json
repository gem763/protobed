But this is getting out of control. Here\u2019s what drives me nuts on the misinformation superhighway:\n\n1. \u201cHealth care is unaffordable.\u201d There\u2019s no denying health care is expensive and insurance premiums can be a heavy financial burden. And, yes, surveys find that Americans think health care is unaffordable. But what about a day at the ballpark? Is that cheap? Have you ever seen a survey about that?\n\nNobody, it seems, wants to spend their hard-earned money on health care. They don\u2019t even want to fork over a modest copay. We each need to come to grips with health care spending as a regular part of our family budget.\n\n2. \u201cHealth insurance is the problem.\u201d Health insurance premiums reflect the cost and use of health care. If the cost and use of health care rises, so too will premiums. Health care costs drive premiums, not the other way around.\n\nThe real problem with health insurance is that it isn\u2019t insurance at all. We expect our health insurance to reimburse us for everything we spend, rather than just for extraordinary expenses. That\u2019s not how real insurance works.\n\n3. \u201cHealth insurance company profits are the problem.\u201d That\u2019s ridiculous. Those profits have nothing to do with health care costs\u2014and they represent just a small portion of health insurance premiums.\n\nMoreover, most Americans have health care coverage that doesn\u2019t involve insurance, because their employer is self-insuring or they\u2019re covered by a government program. The profit margins for health insurance companies are nearly the same as regulated utilities\u2014in the 3\u00bd% to 10% range. When you read that an insurance company has billions in profits, divide it among all the policies in effect and you\u2019ll see the individual impact is modest.\n\nRead: These are the best new ideas in retirement\n\n4. \u201cTeachers are underpaid.\u201d It isn\u2019t possible to pay good teachers commensurate with the value they bring to a community or a child. But generally, they aren\u2019t underpaid. Yes, you need to consider their salary. But you also need to consider vacation time, benefits while working and benefits received once retired, notably pension benefits.\n\n5. \u201cSocial Security has a surplus.\u201d A surplus implies you have more than is needed to meet obligations. The reality: Social Security has unfunded liabilities in the tens of trillions of dollars. What Social Security has is a reserve\u2014a trust fund that\u2019s gradually being depleted. The reserve, by itself, is sufficient to pay current benefits for about 53 months.\n\n6. \u201cSocial Security is going bankrupt.\u201d Wrong again. As long as there are taxes coming in, Social Security can\u2019t go bankrupt. But when the Social Security trust fund is depleted, the incoming taxes won\u2019t be sufficient to pay 100% of promised benefits.\n\n7. \u201cCongress stole the trust fund.\u201d This is a rumor that just won\u2019t die. Nobody stole the Social Security trust fund. It\u2019s invested in special interest-generating Treasury bonds. Last year, those bonds paid $80 billion in interest, which was then used to pay Social Security benefits.\n\n8. \u201cCongress should give retirees more.\u201d There\u2019s a misconception that the annual Social Security cost-of-living increase is determined by Congress or the president, both of whom get the blame when there\u2019s little or no \u201cpay raise\u201d for retirees.\n\nBut in truth, the increase is based on the annual change in a key inflation measure, CPI-W. There\u2019s no annual decision by Congress or the president. Many people want to move to CPI-E, which is designed to better reflect the inflation rate experienced by seniors. But CPI-E is no guarantee of a higher Social Security cost-of-living increase\u2014and often the difference isn\u2019t significant.\n\n9. \u201cCongressmen are paid their salary for life.\u201d This is another persistent rumor. To receive a pension, a member of Congress must have five years of service, which means a member of the House of Representatives would need to be re-elected twice. A pension is nothing close to full pay. And, yes, members of Congress pay Social Security taxes and contribute toward their pensions.\n\n10. \u201cMembers of Congress are overpaid.\u201d At $174,000 a year, which is nearly three times the median household income, it\u2019s easy to feel members of Congress are paid too much. But I\u2019d argue Congress is underpaid.\n\nThink of it this way: You have a good job or run a small business. You have a family. You then win a job in Congress\u2014which you may lose two years later. Could you afford to move your family to Washington, D. C.? Could you afford to maintain two homes, one in your home state and one in the District of Columbia? The cost of living in the Washington area is nearly 60% higher than the national average. Members of Congress had their pay last increased more than a decade ago. Some estimate that tight family finances compel 50 to 100 members to live in their offices.\n\n11. \u201cTimes are different.\u201d Change doesn\u2019t mean loss of opportunity. Rather, it means different opportunities\u2014requiring different strategies to cope. Yes, baby boomers had the advantage of the post-World War II economic boom. But today\u2019s millennials have the advantage of vastly improved technology and a more open world. Why all the complaining?\n\n12. Assumptions and consequences. It drives me nuts that so few people ask about the assumptions used or the possible\u2014and sometimes unintended\u2014consequences of\u2026just about anything. The cost, or the projected savings from, a new government program can be swayed by tweaking assumptions. Take state pension funds. Assume a higher rate of investment return and the funding can suddenly look a whole lot better.\n\n13. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to save.\u201d As Henry Ford may have said, \u201cWhether you believe you can do a thing or not, you are right.\u201d\n\nExcept for the chronically poor, everyone can save. The first step is taking an honest look at where your money goes, especially differentiating between necessities and other spending. The secret is to pay yourself first, preferably through an automatic savings program.\n\n14. \u201cHow much money will I need for retirement?\u201d How am I supposed to know? There\u2019s no quick and easy answer, because there are so many factors\u2014and those factors vary with every individual. What standard of living do you want to maintain? How much savings will you need to maintain that standard of living through a long retirement that\u2019ll likely see at least modest inflation? What will your Social Security benefit provide each month? Gather all that information and you can get a reasonable answer to your question.\n\n15. Bonus: Shopping carts. I\u2019ve saved my favorite gripe for last\u2014and, I\u2019ll freely admit, it has nothing to do with misinformation. What is it that prevents so many people from returning their shopping carts to where they belong? I\u2019ll go out on a limb here and say it\u2019s a reflection of how these folks behave in other areas of their lives. And, yes, they probably don\u2019t believe in facts, either.\n\nThis column first appeared on Humble Dollar and was republished with permission.\n\nRichard Quinn blogs at QuinnsCommentary.com.
