Then I saw the roof and realised it was the boat from Grand Designs - it looked very strange just sat there opposite our cafe.\n\n\"The boat had been up the coast for a couple of years now - it's a bit tatty to be honest with you.\"\n\nOwner Chris Miller later said they'd been hoping to resurrect the project, but the \u00a370,000 worth of damage caused by vandals and teenagers throwing parties meant it was no longer a viable option.\n\nThe Lighthouse\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nIn an episode which Grand Designs viewers branded the 'saddest yet', developer Edward White revealed his attempts to build his dream home cost him his money and his marriage.\n\nThe build on Chesil Cliff House in Croyde, Devon, started in 2011, but the \u00a31.8million White borrowed for the project soon ran out.\n\nHe constructed a smaller neighbouring property called The Eye in the hope of selling it to raise revenue, but was unable to put it on the market due to the building site next door.\n\nNow \u00a33million in debt, he needs another \u00a32million to complete the half-finished home and admitted that once it's done he'll have to sell it immediately to pay back his creditors.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nAnd the pressure of the project, coupled with what White called his 'ambition and vanity', ultimately ended his marriage to wife Hazel.\n\n\"The whole project has been a horrendous strain for Hazel, I have sunk our family purse into this and I really feel for her. I never meant to put her through any of this,\" he told Devon Live.\n\nWhite now says he's on the cusp of securing the money to finish the job and predicts it could be completed as early as next September.", "description": "Channel 4's Grand Designs has seen some epic builds - while others have been left derelict and trashed by vandals and squatters", "authors": ["Frances Kindon", "Image", "Tripadvisor", "Peter Powell", "Sunday People", "Channel", "Alamy Stock Photo", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20706045.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_PAY-Derelict-Houseboat-Medway-Eco-barge-from-Grand-Designs-washed-up-on-beach-at-Southend-on-Sea.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
