Kai Kahele, as well as her thorny relationships with other Aloha State politicians.\n\nA trio of former Hawaii governors have backed Kahele\u2019s bid to unseat Gabbard, and she ignited a feud with Sen. Mazie Hirono after authoring an op-ed in January accusing Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee of \u201creligious bigotry\u201d in their questioning of a nominee for a district judgeship.\n\nHirono, a member of that panel who previously held Gabbard\u2019s House seat, criticized the congresswoman and called her assertions \u201ctotally unfounded\u201d during an interview in March.\n\nGabbard\u2019s decision is also likely to stoke speculation that she is considering mounting a third-party presidential campaign, especially amid her high-profile clash over the past week with 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe former secretary of State has controversially suggested that Russian operatives are \u201cgrooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d remarks which provoked a fierce rebuke from Gabbard and a defense of the Democratic candidate by President Donald Trump.\n\nSeveral of Gabbard\u2019s former rivals in the Democratic nominating contest have returned to their day jobs on Capitol Hill since exiting the race, including New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan and California Rep. Eric Swalwell.\n\nGillibrand is not up for reelection until 2024, and the three congressmen have all said they will seek another term in next year\u2019s election.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/cc/42/ce0d05e649158f6ff7c631f0479c/190924-tulsi-gabbard-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
