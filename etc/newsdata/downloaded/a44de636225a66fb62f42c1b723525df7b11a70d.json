NASA/JPL/Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope/Handout via REUTERS\n\n(Reuters) - A newly discovered comet hurtling toward the orbit of Mars has scientists scurrying to confirm whether it came from outside the solar system, a likely prospect that would make it the second such interstellar object observed in our planetary neighborhood.\n\nThe trajectory of the comet, first detected by Crimean astronomer Gennady Borisov, follows a highly curved path barreling in the sun\u2019s direction at unusually high speeds, evidence that it originated beyond the solar system.\n\n\u201cOn our team we\u2019ve been scrambling here at the University of Hawaii to get observations to make position measurements,\u201d said Karen Meech, an astronomer at the university whose team concluded that the object\u2019s size and tail of gas classify it as a comet.\n\n\u201cEvery time a new comet is discovered, everybody starts to try and get data so that you can get the orbit,\u201d Meech told Reuters, adding that her researchers \u201call are 100 percent convinced that this really, truly is interstellar.\u201d\n\nThe comet, an apparent amalgam of ice and dust, is expected to make its closest approach to the sun on Dec. 8, putting it 190 million miles (300 million km) from Earth, on a route believed unique to such objects of interstellar origin.\n\nOnce confirmed interstellar, the comet - dubbed C/2019 Q4 by astronomers - would become only the second such body ever observed by scientists.\n\nThe first was a cigar-shaped comet dubbed \u2018Oumuamua - a name of Hawaiian origin meaning a messenger from afar arriving first - that sailed into our planetary neighborhood in 2017, prompting initial speculation that it may have been an alien spacecraft. Astronomers soon reached a consensus that it was not.\n\nUnlike \u2018Oumuamua, which visited the solar system for only a week, the newfound comet will linger near Mars\u2019 orbit for almost a year, giving scientists ample time to characterize its chemical signatures and seek further clues about its origin.\n\n\u201cThe high velocity indicates not only that the object likely originated from outside our solar system, but also that it will leave and head back to interstellar space,\u201d said Davide Farnocchia, an astronomer at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.", "description": "A newly discovered comet hurtling toward the orbit of Mars has scientists scurrying to confirm whether it came from outside the solar system, a likely prospect that would make it the second such interstellar object observed in our planetary neighborhood.", "authors": ["Joey Roulette", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429306406&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C07K", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
