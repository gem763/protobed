Not what we wanted really before going home. But what can you do? Other people have lost their jobs, so we\u2019re not as bad (off) as some other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cSays there\u2019s not going to be any flights, we\u2019re going to be stuck here in the airport until 7 o\u2019clock (pm) I think. We were meant to fly at 10 o\u2019clock (pm, on Sunday)... They\u2019re going to fly back to Manchester and then (for us) a coach trip back to Newcastle...\u201d\n\nHELEN, TRYING TO GET HOME TO GLASGOW, SCOTLAND\n\n\u201cThey said they directed (those of us bound for) Glasgow... to Birmingham, then they\u2019re bussing us from Birmingham to Glasgow. So that\u2019s as far as we know, but things could change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite sad, it is sad you know. Sad for all the staff too, you\u2019ve got to think.\u201d\n\nPassengers are seen at Thomas Cook check-in points at Mallorca Airport after the world's oldest travel firm collapsed stranding hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers around the globe and sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history, in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, September 23, 2019. REUTERS/Enrique Calvo\n\nUNNAMED BRITISH MOTHER IN WHEELCHAIR TRAVELING TO GLASGOW\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very anxious because I have sore legs so I don\u2019t know how, if I\u2019m going on a plane and then how I\u2019m going to get to Glasgow if they take us to Birmingham or somewhere else. So it\u2019s going to be very difficult and a long day and I\u2019m very tired.\n\nAsked if travelers were being given information about what to do: \u201cNone, none. We watch it on the news to find out what is happening. So no one has phoned us, no one has emailed us, we\u2019ve had to find out just when we\u2019ve arrived.\u201d", "description": "More than half a million holidaymakers were stranded around the globe on Monday following the collapse of Thomas Cook , the world's oldest travel firm.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432897939&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0JH", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
