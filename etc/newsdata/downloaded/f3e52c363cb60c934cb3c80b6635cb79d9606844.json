September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\nWhen will the rematch happen?\n\nIt was widely believed that the first fight would happen at some point early in 2019, likely February, but soon after facing Paul, KSI admitted that he wanted an extended break away from the ring to recover and that it would be sometime \u201cin the summer\u201d \u2013 having fought twice in 2018, it\u2019s understandable.\n\nThe bout is set to take place on 9th November, 2019. We\u2019re not too far off then.\n\nWhere will the rematch take place?\n\nThe fight between the two YouTube sensations will take place at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles, California. The first went down at the MEN Arena in Manchester, so this time it\u2019s on Logan\u2019s turf.\n\nHow can I get tickets?\n\nDemand for the first fight was somewhat unprecedented and sold out the Manchester Arena, so if you like the idea of being around 18,000 screaming kids for hours then you\u2019ll have to act fast. Tickets will be on general sale from Saturday, 14th September with pre-sale on the 10th.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I can\u2019t wait to see the memes of him slumped on the ground after I\u2019ve repeatedly beaten the life out of him. He\u2019s facing a different animal this time. He will soon realize.\n\n\u201cBig shoutout to DAZN and Matchroom Boxing USA for hosting a monumental fight that will be in the record books whether people like it or not. November 9 is the day \u2018The Nightmare\u2019 becomes his reality.\u201d\n\nLogan Paul: \u201cI\u2019m excited to ruin JJs face and I want to thank DAZN for giving me the platform to do so.\n\n\u201cLast fight, KSI couldn\u2019t beat me with only three months of training under my belt. For the past year, while JJ has been wasting his time trying to become a rapper, I\u2019ve been training every single day. I\u2019m finally getting what I wanted from the beginning \u2013 no headgear, 10oz gloves, and the opportunity to dismantle JJ\u2019s repugnant face in Los Angeles, my home city.\n\n\u201cAfter November 9, the embarrassment of losing will eat away at KSI\u2019s ego for the next decade; he will be afraid to show face in America. This time, I won\u2019t leave it up to the judges.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a DAZN fan for a very long time, so it\u2019s an honor to partner with DAZN and Matchroom Boxing USA for what will become the biggest combat sporting event of the year.\u201d\n\nWhat are the odds?\n\nKSI to win: 5/6\n\nLogan Paul to win: 5/6\n\nDraw: 10/1", "description": "KSI\u00a0and\u00a0Logan Paul\u00a0are set to do battle again in 2019, after the pair first met in what was described as the \u201cbiggest internet event in history\u201d last year.", "authors": ["Adam Hamdani"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/31/11/ksi-logan-paul.jpg"}
