The next hearing in the case was set for Dec. 11, said his lawyer, Halit Akalp.\n\nTopuz is charged with espionage and links to the network of cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is based in the United States and blamed by Turkey for plotting the failed 2016 coup. Washington says Topuz is innocent.\n\nThe court has repeatedly said it wants to hear another witness in the case file. But lawyers on Wednesday told the court that the address on record for that witness did not exist.\n\nIn his final defence ahead of the ruling, Topuz said he did not accept the accusations and demanded his acquittal.\n\nLawyers for Topuz applied in January to the European Court of Human Rights and the court accepted the application, a person close to the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nThe trial of Topuz has been one of various sources of strain in already fragile ties between NATO allies Turkey and the United States.", "description": "A Turkish court ruled on Wednesday to keep a U.S. consulate employee in jail as his trial on espionage charges continues, a lawyer said, meaning he will remain in detention until the next hearing in December.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
