These are clinics for women, run by women,\" Garratt said.\n\n\"We've listened closely to survivors and their advocates and designed these brand new services with them, meaning that these clinics, and the highly-trained staff who will work in it, represent a real step-change in the quality and timeliness of support the NHS provides.\"\n\nGarratt added that FGM survivors \"deserve to be heard and supported\", which is \"exactly what the NHS is working with them and others to achieve\".\n\n\"Not only are we supporting individual women, but the impact this has on their families, communities and of equal importance, the next generation,\" the chief nursing officer stated.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
