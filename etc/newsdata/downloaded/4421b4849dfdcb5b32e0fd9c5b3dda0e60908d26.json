The women are coming. They arrived last November. We are now \u2014 this is the eighth September in a row where the majority of first graders in this country last month were not white.\u201d\n\nMatthews interjected, \u201cMeaning Hispanic, African-American or Asian.\u201d\n\nMoore continued, \u201cCorrect. We now see the demographic shift that by the 2040\u2019s white people will be the minority, and I think there\u2019s some level of fear about that.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd those of us who are white, especially white guys, still having that door opened just a little bit easier for us. And we know it. We know we\u2019re not followed around when we go to the department store.\u201d\n\nMatthews said, \u201cSo that spreads fear into the white voter and he votes white.\u201d\n\nMoore said, \u201cYes, because some white voters are afraid. When you\u2019re in power, you don\u2019t want to lose what you have, and let\u2019s face it.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Tuesday's broadcast of MSNBC's \"Hardball,\" documentary filmmaker Michael Moore said white working class voters are afraid of losing power because of | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/michaelmoore1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
