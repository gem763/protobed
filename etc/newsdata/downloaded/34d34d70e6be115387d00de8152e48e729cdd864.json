From recalling hidden French bistros to reminiscing about his mother\u2019s home cooking, Deon Meyer reveals his local and international foodie haunts, favourite recipes and the one ice-cream flavour he\u2019s still completely addicted to after all these years.\n\nAt the moment my wife and I are loving Kokkedoor! It\u2019s a lot of fun and I love anything to do with cooking and eating (laughs). I loved appearing on the show this year, as a judge in the literary-themed episode shot in the beautiful Centre for the Book in Cape Town. I really think that, this season especially, the production value is so high, it\u2019s really an incredible show and we can be very proud of it.\n\nI love Bertus Basson\u2019s restaurant Eike in Stellenbosch. It is just simply magnificent, and my wife and I love returning there, time and again. (Eike has also been nominated for the 2019 Eat Out Mercedes-Benz Restaurant of the Year).\n\nIn Paris, up in Les Marais, there is a wonderful Moroccan restaurant in Les Marche des Enfants Rouges (Le Traiteur Marocain). In Bordeaux, where we spend most of our time, there\u2019s a little bistro called Au Bistrot, which is really great. At the market in Bordeaux, there\u2019s also a restaurant that is only open over weekends and they serve the most fantastic tapas I\u2019ve had in my life.\n\nMy guilty food pleasure is most definitely ice cream! Ben & Jerry\u2019s Peanut Butter Cup flavour, to be specific. I tasted it in Canada the first time and my family always makes a point of getting it from our favourite supermarket in Bordeaux when we\u2019re in France. I\u2019m completely addicted to the stuff.\n\nSteak-and-kidney pie reminds me of my mother. When I was young, my mother made the most wonderful steak-and-kidney pie. I wish I had her recipe, it was just magnificent. It\u2019s something that you don\u2019t see quite often in shops and supermarkets these days. And If I had to choose one last meal, it would have to be a really good, spicy Indian prawn curry.\n\n\n\nTrackers airs Sunday evenings from 27 October on M-Net (DStv 101) at 8pm.\n\n\n\nFor more TV news and updates, visit Channel24!\n\nImages supplied\n\nRead more on: features | celebrities", "description": "Not only is he of one our country\u2019s top novelists, with his books being translated into 27 languages, but the best-selling crime author is also a surprisingly ardent (and well-travelled) bon vivant at heart.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7830/981f6127e3b24734bf1651c4a31612b7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
