One element of the plan would involve sterilising eggs in the nest to encourage females to incubate but not hatch them.\n\nThe plan is to be implemented in autumn next year, with an estimated cost of 100,000 Euro (\u00a390,000).\n\nThe distinctive green-plumed, grey-breasted creatures - also known as monk parakeets - 'have become a concern for a number of citizens' and 'we have received a number of complaints,' said Borja Carabante, municipal officer for environmental affairs in the capital.\n\nParakeets flying towards a pigeon at a park in Madrid in this file photo taken in September 2016\n\nThey are responsible for irritating chirping and can transmit diseases, as well as driving out other birds.\n\nThe parakeets' numbers have soared by a third since 2016, according to Spanish ornithological society SEO/Birdlife.\n\nUnder Spanish law, the birds are classified as an exotic invasive species.", "description": "The Spanish capital is home to 12,000 Argentine quaker parrots which are common in much of South America and compete with other birds for food and rip branches from trees to build their nests.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/13/19440996-0-image-a-65_1570536441810.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
