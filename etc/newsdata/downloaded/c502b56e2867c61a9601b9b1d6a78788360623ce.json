Shortly after, the State Department submitted a withdrawal notice, which required a one-year waiting period.\n\nNavarro noted he will be going to a meeting in Geneva later this month where he will address the U.S.'s future in the UPU \u2013 after which the U.S. will have fair rates either way, he said.\n\nSimon Lester, associate director of Cato's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, told FOX Business that the Trump administration has a \u201clegitimate concern about the status quo,\u201d but was unsure whether a confrontational approach would lead to a solution.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General was addressing the rate structure years ago. In 2014, it wrote the system creates winners and losers and benefits \u201cChina Post and Chinese online retailers at the expense of the Postal Service \u2026 and American retailers.\u201d\n\nIn an opinion article published in the Financial Times this week, Navarro hammered down on the idea that China is a big winner.\n\n\u201cToday manufacturers in countries as small as Cambodia and as large as China pay less to send small parcels from their countries to New York than US manufacturers do to ship packages from Los Angeles to the Big Apple,\u201d Navarro wrote, adding that other countries are also \u201cvictims\u201d of the rate system.\n\nHe told FOX Business that American manufacturers are unable to compete with that, adding that a lot of the products being subsidized are counterfeit products, fentanyl and other opioids.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. is scheduled to meet for the thirteenth round of high-level trade talks with China next month as a prolonged trade war drags on. Navarro did not expect the UPU controversy to play into those talks.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The U.S. is prepared to withdraw from the agency it helped establish in the 1870s.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/12/0/0/post-office-istock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
