On Thursday, France said it would block any attempt to launch or develop the firm\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency.\n\nThis rebuff is the latest setback for the serially scandalous social media company, in what is arguably the most ambitious project it has ever undertaken.\n\nIt all began at the start of 2018, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that his annual \u201cpersonal challenge\u201d for that year would be to explore and understand cryptocurrency. Six months later, he had set up a taskforce to develop what could eventually become a new global currency to rival the dollar.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFacebook claims Libra is designed to bring key financial services to those without bank accounts by leveraging its suite of apps like Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp \u2013 together with its vast user base of more than 2 billion people.\n\nBut France claims that Libra poses a threat to the sovereignty of national currencies. In the UK, politicians expressed similar reservations earlier this year by suggesting Facebook is \u201ctrying to turn itself into its own country\u201d through the development of Libra.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He was told that Facebook was \u201cdelusional\u201d to believe that people will trust it with their money given the company\u2019s track record surrounding user data.\n\nFor Facebook\u2019s part, it has consistently stated that it wants to work closely with regulators to meet any conditions required to roll Libra out. Marcus told US senators that the reason it had announced Libra so far ahead of its launch was to sort out any issues that might come up.\n\nIn response to the latest comments of French economy and finance minister Bruno Le Maire, a Libra spokesperson told The Independent that the cryptocurrency had become \u201cthe world\u2019s most scrutinised fintech effort\u201d, but once again said it \u201cwelcomed the feedback\u201d.\n\nBut Facebook is not the only company to be working on a cryptocurrency, with rival messaging app Telegram also developing its own virtual currency called Gram. Without Facebook\u2019s notoriety surrounding data and privacy, Telegram has managed to avoid the same level of scrutiny, and beyond its whitepaper there is little that is known about the effort.\n\nBoth of these projects could be dwarfed by a new digital currency reportedly being developed in China. According to research published last month, China\u2019s central bank is planning to launch a state-backed cryptocurrency that could entirely eliminate the need for bank accounts.\n\nIt is hard to believe that China will give much thought to the complaints of financial regulators in the EU or the US. With 1.4 billion inhabitants, the country\u2019s new cryptocurrency would eclipse bitcoin or any other virtual currency that has come before it. Its arrival could consign Facebook\u2019s Libra to the footnotes of global regulators\u2019 concerns.", "description": "Facebook is once again in trouble with authorities, though this time it is for something that is yet to even happen.
