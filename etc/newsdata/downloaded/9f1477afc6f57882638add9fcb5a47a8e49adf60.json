It\u2019s not a secret that Republicans support gun rights. But that\u2019s what makes this story \u2014 or stories, rather \u2014 interesting. People who are familiar with the results of this poll are curiously eager to share the takeaway from it with the media, even though it allegedly says exactly what you\u2019d expect it to say.\n\nBut they\u2019re also being very, very coy about what it says exactly. No numbers have been released. \u201cGun control would be a problem politically for Trump\u201d is about as specific as they\u2019re willing to get. How come, if they\u2019re otherwise willing to chatter to reporters about it?\n\nThe Times reported on the poll yesterday, with uncharacteristic vagueness:\n\nPresident Trump assured Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, on Thursday that he was still considering legislation that could include background checks for gun buyers. But White House aides said they had polling data showing that gun control was politically problematic for the president, according to two people briefed on the meeting\u2026 Mr. Trump\u2019s aides were on hand for the meeting, and the president told Mr. Manchin that a background checks bill that the senator had pushed for with a Republican counterpart, Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, was still on the table, according to the people briefed on the discussion. But the polling data, White House aides said, indicated that the issue does not help the president with his core base of supporters, according to the people briefed on the meeting.\n\nThat\u2019s as much detail as the story provides on the poll\u2019s findings even though its existence and its influence on Trump\u2019s thinking is the entire point of the article. ABC posted its own story about the poll last night \u2014 and they\u2019re as much in the dark as the Times is:\n\nAs President Donald Trump has mulled acting on gun control legislation in the wake of a string of mass shootings, data gathered by the president\u2019s campaign showed that supporting any gun control measures would pose a problem for him politically going into the 2020 election season, according to sources familiar with the results. The data is comprised of campaign polling conducted before recent back-to-back mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, that left 31 dead \u2014 as well as more recent outreach to his base and independent voters, according to the sources. ABC News has not independently reviewed the data. The sources said it\u2019s likely to inform Trump\u2019s decision on whether to act on any gun control legislation, despite separate nationwide polling showing widespread public support for tougher gun sale background checks. The White House requested data from the campaign on how Trump\u2019s base and independent voters would react if Trump were to support gun control measures late last month, after the Dayton and El Paso shootings, the sources told ABC News.\n\nThat\u2019s all ABC knows. Note, by the way, how similar the phrasing in both stories is: Gun control will pose a \u201cpolitical problem\u201d for Trump in 2020, which is so vague as to be *almost* meaningless. A political problem how, exactly? Are 80 percent of Republicans against universal background checks, in which case Trump signing them into law would be catastrophic for his chances next year? Or are 10 percent of Republicans opposed to them, which still technically qualifies as \u201cpolitically problematic\u201d given how tight the margins were in the Rust Belt in 2016? Did the poll define Trump\u2019s \u201ccore base of supporters\u201d as the entire Republican electorate or as some much smaller subset of that, like \u201ccampaign donors\u201d or \u201cFox News viewers\u201d? How did they define \u201cgun control\u201d for respondents \u2014 as a broad unspecified term or with particular proposals like background checks, red-flag laws, an assault-weapons ban, and so on? If they polled particular proposals, was Trump\u2019s \u201ccore base\u201d adamantly opposed to all or did some poll better than others?\n\nI ask because there are lots of public polls about guns that include numbers on Republican opinion. Quinnipiac asked about universal background checks just two weeks ago. Result:\n\nPublic polls on UBCs routinely show support at those levels. If Team Trump\u2019s poll found similar numbers, I\u2019m curious to know why they think a background-checks would be \u201cpolitically problematic\u201d for him. Here\u2019s the result from Quinnipiac, meanwhile, when people were asked if they support or oppose red-flag laws (\u201callowing the police or family members to petition a judge to remove guns from a person that may be at risk for violent behavior\u201d):\n\nNearly three-quarters support there too. To be sure, Republicans didn\u2019t support every gun-control proposal. They split 37/59 on a new assault-weapons ban and 18/77 on a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons already in circulation. But they\u2019re more open to regulation than I would have thought, and sometimes in surprising ways. Here\u2019s how things shake out when people are asked if they support or oppose \u201crequiring individuals to obtain a license before being able to purchase a gun\u201d:\n\nSixty-nine percent *of Republicans* support letting government license gun ownership? I\u2019d love to compare Team Trump\u2019s data.\n\nThe public polling may solve part of the mystery about the leaks to the NYT and ABC. Maybe Trump and his team are nervous that publicly available data like Quinnipiac\u2019s is building momentum for gun-control measures like UBC and red-flag laws. \u201cOur data says otherwise,\u201d they\u2019re insisting, \u201cand no, you can\u2019t see it.\u201d But if that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here, who\u2019s the target audience? Whose spine are they trying to steel with rumors of secret numbers showing that Republican voters really do hate universal background checks? It can\u2019t be congressional Republicans. They have their own internal pollsters, and they know better by now than to trust Trump. It can\u2019t be MAGA Nation either. They don\u2019t care what polls like Quinnipiac\u2019s say. They expect Trump to stand firm and protect their priorities even if the entire world opposes them.\n\nSo why is the Trump campaign so eager to leak the bottom-line result from the poll but also so reluctant to share details? I don\u2019t get it.", "description": "Pressure.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/t-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
