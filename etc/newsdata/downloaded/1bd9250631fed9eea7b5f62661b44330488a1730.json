We will not be making any further comment and would like to request that our privacy \u2013 and that of our wider family and friends \u2013 is respected at this time.\n\nKylie Moore-Gilbert is reportedly being held in the same Tehran prison as Australian travel bloggers Mark Firkin and Jolie King, who were recently detained in Iran for flying a drone.\n\nForeign minister Marise Payne says the Australian government is \u201cmaking efforts to ensure they are being treated fairly, humanely and in custom to international norms.\u201d", "description": "Kylie Moore-Gilbert has been named as the University of Melbourne academic who currently faces twelve years behind bars in Iran.", "authors": ["Alasdair Duncan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/KylieMooreGilbertJailed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
