The mentally ill 51-year-old was limp as the male correctional officers delivered the blows, a federal lawsuit alleges. Her head bobbed along the ground, eyes rolled back.\n\nThe Aug. 21 assault at Florida\u2019s Lowell Correctional Institution nearly killed Weimar, and left her a quadriplegic. At the hospital where she has spent the past few weeks, she breathes through a tracheotomy and eats through a tube. She will need round-the-clock medical care for the rest of her life, according to the lawsuit.\n\nNow, Weimar\u2019s lawyer claims in a new lawsuit, the Florida Department of Corrections is trying to wriggle out of paying for that care. Prison officials are seeking to release the injured woman from their custody early, a move that would free them from covering all her medical bills.\n\n\u201cThe only reason she needs any sort of medical care for quadriplegia is as a result of their employees,\u201d attorney Ryan Andrews told The Washington Post. \u201cIn my view, they\u2019ve been playing games with her since this happened.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Corrections said it could release only limited information about the incident, which was first reported by the Miami Herald, because it remains under investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that preliminary reports from this incident are concerning,\u201d Mark Inch, secretary of the Corrections Department, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to examining all the details regarding this situation and ensuring appropriate action is taken.\u201d\n\nIn court filings, the agency has denied wrongdoing and asked the judge to dismiss the case.\n\nOfficials have not publicly identified the guards accused of attacking Weimar. Andrews, who filed the most recent lawsuit to force the department to turn over records, said they are still on the job. The Department of Corrections said they have been reassigned to posts that keep them out of contact with inmates.\n\nThe beating was the latest tragedy for Weimar, her attorney said. She showed up at a relative\u2019s house at 6 years old with cigarette burns on her body, he said. She drifted in and out of jail over the years, the Herald reported, arrested on charges including loitering, burglary, prostitution and public drunkenness. At times, she experienced homelessness.\n\n\u201cShe basically spent her whole life on the streets just trying to get by,\u201d Andrews said of Weimar, who is bipolar and has an anxiety disorder.\n\n[She began to talk \u2014 then mysteriously fell silent. Months later her parents learned why.]\n\nShe landed at Lowell Correctional Institution in 2016. The central Florida women\u2019s prison is the state\u2019s largest and country\u2019s second-largest, according to the Herald, which has documented deaths, mistreatment and abuse behind its walls. The facility is the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation, the newspaper reported.\n\nWeimar was sentenced to serve six years there after pleading no contest to aggravated battery and resisting arrest with violence. The charges stemmed from a 2015 altercation with her ex-boyfriend in Broward County, during which Weimar cut him with a knife.\n\nOn Aug. 21, about eight months into her sentence, Weimar was on work duty. She was tasked with cleaning toilets, but because of a hip condition, told the guards she couldn\u2019t do it. The guards became irate \u2014 and then violent, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cWith a bad hip and nothing more than cleaning supplies, (Weimar) was defenseless,\u201d the suit says.\n\nThe guards allegedly slammed her to the ground and hit her in the head, neck and back. They dragged her outside, to an area where surveillance cameras couldn\u2019t record the beating. Other inmates watched in horror and begged other employees to intervene, Andrews said. Some were convinced the guards were beating a dead body.\n\nWhen it was over, one of the prison employees said, \u201cShe was already disabled; they just disabled her more,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nWeimar was taken to Memorial Hospital in Jacksonville. She is being treated by medical providers contracted by the Department of Corrections, confined in a medical wing reserved for prisoners.\n\nWith credit for time served, Weimar is not scheduled to be released until January 2021, records show. But now, Andrews said, the Department of Corrections is considering seeking a medical release so she gets out sooner. His lawsuit claims department employees persuaded her to sign documents she did not understand, which signed over her disability benefits.\n\n[Her case opened the way for people with disabilities to reclaim their freedom. Now, her words open a book that could help countless more.]\n\nIf Weimar were released, Andrews said, the agency would be responsible for only half of her medical expenses, while Medicare would cover the rest. The change would be made through what\u2019s called conditional medical release, a program that allows the Corrections Department to recommend that a commission approve the early release of terminally ill or permanently incapacitated inmates.\n\nAndrews said he is usually supportive of the concept, which allows the imprisoned a chance to spend time with loved ones while they are dying or disabled. But in this case, he\u2019s suspicious of the motivation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good faith,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much good faith you could possibly have here when your employees do this to her.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nConfessions made him the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history.
