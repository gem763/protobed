A total of 19 incidents occurred in 2018:\n\nFour liquids incidents, resulting in a total of 175.5 barrels of oil being released, 94% of which was recovered. One of the liquids incidents is classified as significant because it resulted in a release of more than 50 barrels. All 113.2 barrels spilled in that case were fully recovered.\n\nFifteen natural gas incidents, five of which are classified as significant because the failure modes were reported as ruptures. Three were caused by third-party damage, one was caused by cracking and one is still under investigation.\n\n\u201cNo incident is acceptable, and we won\u2019t be satisfied until we can report zero incidents,\u201d said Chris Bloomer, CEPA President and CEO. \u201cThat\u2019s why our members set aside their competitive differences and work together to share knowledge, technology and learnings to continuously improve on what is already one of the best safety records in the world.\u201d\n\nThe report also looks at the industry\u2019s focus on incident prevention and environmental protection. Highlights include:\n\n2,665 proactive integrity digs to examine pipelines for defects and make repairs.\n\n51,563 kilometres of in-line inspections completed using highly sophisticated \u201csmart pigs\u201d that examine pipelines from the inside.\n\n$2 billion invested in the maintenance and monitoring of pipeline systems.\n\n$22.6 million invested in innovative technology focused on reducing pipeline corrosion and improving leak detection and damage prevention.\n\n452 emergency response exercises, ranging in complexity from drills to full-scale exercises.\n\nThe full 2019 Transmission Pipeline Industry Performance Report is available at https://pr19.cepa.com.\n\nThe Canadian Energy Pipeline Association (CEPA) consists of Canada\u2019s leading transmission pipeline companies. These pipelines are the large energy highways that deliver oil and natural gas across the country to where people need it, and into ports for export to the world. In 2018, CEPA members were responsible for moving 97 per cent of the oil and natural gas Canada produces through a pipeline network spanning nearly 121,000 kilometres.
