We typically recommend everyone update to the latest and greatest version of an operating system to enjoy its features, security patches and bug fixes, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re guaranteed to have a perfect experience on your new OS.\n\nIf you encounter any critical issues in Android 10 (including slowdowns), or you just miss the familiarity of Android 9, you can downgrade your device. Though you\u2019re probably better off holding out for any fixes, or backing up your information and factory-resetting your phone to see if that addresses any problems, the nuclear option is still there if you need it.\n\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll walk you through the process of reverting from Android 10 to Android 9. We\u2019re doing this on a Pixel because that\u2019s what we have (and what has Android 10). This process will be different for other Android devices \u2014 if you can even downgrade at all \u2014 and we\u2019ll address those in a separate guide once Android 10 is more widely available.\n\nInstalling the Android SDK Platform-Tools package\n\nWe\u2019ll be using the command-line tool ADB, short for Android Debug Bridge, to downgrade our Google Pixel 3 XL, which means we have to install the Android SDK Platform-Tools package before we can get started doing anything. Click that link, grab the installer for Windows or Mac, and unzip its contents a folder\u2014your pick.\n\nMake sure your phone is fully updated\n\nThis one sounds like a strange step, given we\u2019re trying to downgrade our Pixel device, but hear me out. The downgrade won\u2019t work if there are pending Pixel updates. So, to prevent that, pull up Settings > System > Advanced > System update and check to see if anything is available. If so, download the update, install it, and restart your device.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nDownload the older operating system image\n\nFor Google\u2019s Pixel phones, the company gives you a big list of operating system images to pick from. All I had to do was find my device (a Pixel 3 XL) and grab an image for Android 9.0. Easy as that. In my case, I used the most recent Android 9 image available: 9.0.0 (PQ3A.190801.002, Aug 2019)\n\nSpoiler: This actually wasn\u2019t the correct file to use at all, a fact I\u2019ll address later in this piece. It\u2019s around this point where my first attempt at downgrading my device started to go south, and I wanted to leave my initial thoughts here so you can get a full sense of what to do, and what not to do, if you\u2019re following some downgrading directions you saw on Google\u2019s site for the first time.\n\nEnable USB Debugging\n\nIn order for my computer to talk to my phone over ADB, I also needed to first enable USB Debugging. To do that, pull up Settings > About phone, scroll to the bottom to find \u201cBuild number,\u201d and tap that frantically until you enable Developer Options on your device. Head back to Settings > System > Advanced and tap Developer options. Scroll down to the \u201cDebugging\u201d section and enable \u201cUSB debugging.\u201d\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nSpoiler: You\u2019ll also want to enable \u201cOEM unlocking\u201d while you\u2019re here, which I neglected to do until my second downgrading attempt. More on that in a bit.\n\nPlug your phone into your computer\n\nEasy, right? As you\u2019re doing this, pull up an elevated Command Prompt (right-click and select Run as Administrator) or Terminal. Navigate over to where you unzipped the Android SDK Platform-Tools package.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nReboot your Android and start downgrading (attempt one)\n\nSpoiler: I thought this was the right process at first. I was wrong. You can read through why this doesn\u2019t work in this section, or skip to the next section if you\u2019re getting antsy and just want to downgrade your device without the extra education.\n\nTo get started, enter the following command to reboot your device into its recovery mode. (You might have to accept a \u201cUSB debugging\u201d request on your device first, and then send the command again.)\n\nadb reboot recovery\n\nWhen I did this, my device pulled up a scary-looking \u201cNo command\u201d screen. To get to the main recovery menu, I simply had to hold down the power button, tap the \u201cup volume\u201d button, and release the power button.\n\nPhoto: David Murphy\n\nFrom there, I selected the \u201cApply update from ADB\u201d option on my device using the volume buttons and confirmed it using the power button. My Pixel then looked like this:\n\nPhoto: David Murphy\n\nBack on my computer, I ran the following command to begin sideloading Android 9 back onto my device:\n\nadb sideload crosshatch-ota-pq3a.190801.002-13edb921.zip\n\nYes, that file name is the name of the Android 9 image I downloaded from Google. And, yes, it has to be in the same folder as adb \u2014 don\u2019t forget to move it there from your default downloads folder.\n\nNot only could I see a little flurry of activity on my device:\n\nPhoto: David Murphy\n\nBut I also got a little progress indicator (a per cent counter) on my Command Prompt:\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nAnd then everything failed:\n\nPhoto: David Murphy\n\nHow to downgrade your device (the successful attempt)\n\nI suspect this method would allow you to upgrade your device without an issue, but there are actually a few more steps involved when you\u2019re trying to downgrade your device.\n\nFirst, I had to reboot the phone back to its regular state, revisit Developer options in the Settings app, and enable an option I forgot about: OEM unlocking.\n\nI then rebooted back into ADB by typing adb reboot bootloader in the Command Prompt. Next, I had to install Google\u2019s USB drivers by downloading them, unzipping them, pulling up Windows\u2019 Device Manager, and manually updating the flagged Android device (by right-clicking, selecting \u201cUpdate driver,\u201d and pointing to the directory where I previously unzipped Google\u2019s USB drivers).\n\nI unplugged my phone and plugged it back in (for good luck, I suppose), and I was able to confirm my system could see it by typing fastboot devices in the command prompt.\n\nI then downloaded Google\u2019s factory image of Android 9 for my device \u2014 not the OTA image I previously pulled \u2014 and dropped it into the same folder as my ADB tool.\n\nI felt pretty ready at this point. I unlocked my phone\u2019s bootloader by typing fastboot flashing unlock into the command prompt. This prompted my device to issue a scary little warning, which I ignored; I used the volume buttons to select the new \u201cUnlock the bootloader\u201d option and confirmed using the power button.\n\nPhoto: David Murphy\n\nWhile my phone\u2019s bootloader unlocked, I unzipped the factory image I previously downloaded directly into my ADB folder, so its contents were swimming among all the other files. (Don\u2019t unzip them to a new folder within your platform-tools folder.)\n\nFinally, I typed flash-all into my Command Prompt and crossed my fingers. And... that failed, too, because it said the image wasn\u2019t compatible with my device. Sigh.\n\nTo get around this issue, I decided to try flashing with a different factory image entirely \u2014 the very first \u201ccrosshatch\u201d image available for my Pixel 3 XL, \u201c9.0.0 (PD1A.180720.030, Sep 2018).\u201c I deleted the previous image\u2019s contents from my platform-tools folder, unzipped this image\u2019s contents into the folder like before, and ran flash-all again. And it seemed as if things were working, as I was getting a lot more data about the update processing than before:\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nAfter about two minutes, the update finished and my device automatically rebooted. With more fingers crossed \u2014 I think I was losing circulation by this point \u2014 I powered down my Pixel and manually rebooted it into fastboot mode by holding down the power and volume-down buttons. I then entered fastboot flashing lock into the Command Prompt to lock the bootloader back up (which, again, required me to pick the correct prompt on my phone).\n\nPhoto: David Murphy\n\nFinally, I rebooted my device one final time by selecting the \u201cStart\u201d option on the fastboot screen (using the power button, of course). And \u2014 Great Scott! \u2014 we\u2019ve travelled back to the past. Here\u2019s that Pixel 3 XL now on Android 9 with the old September 2018 security update:\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nA summary of how to (really) downgrade your device\n\nI realise that this long, meandering journey to downgrade my phone might be slightly confusing, but I wanted to walk you through the process to show you the trial-and-error steps you might have to take when you\u2019re performing a downgrade on your device \u2014 be it a Pixel, a Samsung, or whatnot.\n\nI\u2019ve seen plenty of \u201cdowngrading Android\u201d guides that tend to leave out a step or two that\u2019s absolutely critical to the equation. Or, worse, they leave you hanging when you follow their steps and find that the process didn\u2019t work for you. By watching how I did it, hopefully you\u2019ve leveled up your troubleshooting techniques should you find yourself similarly stuck.\n\nHere\u2019s my final checklist of steps for downgrading my Pixel:\n\nDownload and install the Android SDK Platform-Tools package Download and install Google\u2019s USB drivers for your phone Make sure your phone is fully updated Enable Developer Options and turn on USB Debugging and OEM Unlocking Download a factory image for your device for whatever version of Android you want. (The most recent image might not be the optimal choice. Also, don\u2019t use an OTA image.) Use a Command Prompt or Terminal to boot your device into its fastboot mode, and then unlock the bootloader Use the factory image\u2019s \u201cflash-all\u201d command to begin the downgrade Lock your device\u2019s bootloader when done\n\nIt seems so simple in hindsight, right?", "description": "Android 10 is here \u2014 for Pixel devices, at least.
