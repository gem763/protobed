Children are suffering painful, potentially life-limiting diseases.\n\nRadical new plans could see the following favourites being replaced by lower calorie alternatives.\n\nDomino's Large Pepperoni Passion - 1,920kcal\n\n(Image: Domino's)\n\nKFC's Mighty Bucket for One - 1,235kcal\n\n(Image: KFC)\n\nNando's Fino Pitta with Peri-salted chips - 1,243kcal\n\n(Image: Nandos)\n\nMcDonald's Quarter Pounder with cheese and large fries - 1,194kcal\n\n(Image: Alamy Stock Photo)\n\nThe proposals would also see eating on public transport banned in order to stop children snacking on unhealthy food.\n\nDame Sally also wants MPs to cap the calories sold per person at caf\u00e9s and takeaways and has also called for a ban on junk food ads at public venues to help tackle childhood obesity.\n\nIn her final report, Dame Sally, who stepped down on October 1, also asked for VAT to be removed from healthy food.\n\nBut some critics of the healthy eating drive say the NHS is being over-zealous in its approach to the obesity crisis.\n\nUK Hospitality Chief Executive, Kate Nicholls, told the Daily Star: \u201cA blanket cap on calories for all portions of food and drink consumed out-of-home sounds like a knee-jerk and unfair measure.\u201d\n\nOn its website, McDonald's says: \"McDonald's believes that the national obesity issue is a shared responsibility, and a complex one.\n\n\"The company's starting point has been to look at recipe improvements and providing parents with all the nutritional facts.\n\n\"That's why McDonald's has been committed to lowering the salt, sugar and fat levels in Happy Meal menu items over recent years, whilst being careful not to undermine the taste.\n\n\"Along with this, there's been improved nutritional information included on most packaging and the backs of all tray liners in restaurants.\"", "description": "These calorie-laden takeaways could be scrapped in place of healthier alternatives if the mooted proposals are put in place", "authors": ["Neil Murphy", "Image", "Domino'S", "Kfc", "Nandos", "Alamy Stock Photo"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20636395.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_KFC.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
