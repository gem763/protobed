I started laughing.\n\n\"My husband came in and he was a little angry at first - until he found the humour in it too.\n\n\"He was upset at first that his little girl's hair was now all scattered over the floor.\n\n\"Colt had definitely had a good hack away at her hair, but Jen came to the rescue.\n\n\"I'm not sure if Kimber is more spunky now because of her hair, or if her hair now matches her personality. I think the hair definitely suits her more now.\"\n\nBreana and Michael had been in the kitchen eating lunch while their two children were playing around the house last month.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nBut realising the cheeky twosome had been quiet for suspiciously long, the parents went to investigate.\n\nOpening the door to their bedroom closet Breana spotted four tiny feet, and as she pulled back her clothes, she revealed the terrifying sight of her three-year-old son brandishing scissors.\n\nBreana said: \"My son was holding the scissors up to Kimber's head and she was sitting very still and being patient with him while he cut her hair.\n\n\"She was completely calm and still and was just letting him do it.\n\n\"We explained that we don't play with scissors and you could tell Colt felt bad. We had him vacuum up the hair that he'd cut off.\n\n\"I think he's learned his lesson - he won't be doing it again.\n\n\"I'd also found the dresses they'd been hidden behind had rips in them.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"Not only had he been hacking away at Kimber's hair but he'd been destroying my dresses. I had to put one of them in the bin.\"\n\nAfter discussing a hair restyle of her own with neighbour Jen earlier that morning, Breana was forced to send a begging text asking for her help.\n\nSo instead of kicking back and relaxing for her own hair appointment, Breana anxiously watched as the hairdresser worked her magic.\n\nNow, the 'independent' little girl is the envy of her own mum as she 'rocks' her stylish new hair do.\n\nBreana said: \"I messaged her to say 'forget about doing my hair, I need you to do Kimber. Help'.\n\n\"She said she'd be right over. Jen saved the day.\n\n\"We discussed some options and looked at some pictures on the internet.\n\n\"It turned out great. I love the new hair cut - I'm a little jealous and wish I got rock something that rad looking.\"\n\nThe mum added: \"Kimber is very happy and so am I. Even my husband loves it now - he thinks it's adorable.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"She didn't realise what they were doing was wrong, and I think she enjoyed all the attention of getting her haircut.\n\n\"I'm not sure if Colt is destined to be a barber. Every time I get the buzzer and scissors out to cut my husband's hair, he's always begging me to let him try it.\"\n\nAs Jen rushed around to the Naylor household to calm the nervous Breana, she decided to 'embrace' the shocking cut her three-year-old neighbour had done and make a 'cute shape' for Kimber.\n\nJen said: \"My first thought was be calm and make lemonade out of lemons.\n\n\"I said 'okay, we're going to make this cute. We're going make sure she still looks like a little girl. I'm gonna figure out what I'm going to do with those hard lines and we're gone make lemonade out of this.\n\n\"Once I went over there and looked at it, it seemed like the only way we could embrace this with 'lemonade' was if we embraced the lines, straightened them out, and added a few more.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if Breana would be on board with it, so I nervously asked, but they were completely on board and completely joyed that this disaster could actually [end in] a fun little result!\n\n\"It sure seemed that the entire energy about the situation was completely elevated at that moment.\n\n\"I got the clippers out, had fun with that right side, created a cute shape to her full cut - and rest was history!\"", "description": "Parents Breana Naylor and her husband Michael uncovered the hairy situation after they noticed their children had been suspiciously quiet", "authors": ["Sophie Norris", "Image", "Kennedy News", "Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20529244.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Kennedy-News-and-Media.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
