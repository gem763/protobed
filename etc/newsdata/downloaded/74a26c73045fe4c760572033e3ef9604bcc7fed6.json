He was claimed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2014 and then signed by the Washington Redskins later that season.\n\nPolice said in a news release that an officer responded Wednesday night to a 911 call reporting a man damaging the restaurant and the ice cream shop and getting away in a truck without a license plate. The restaurant's rear door showed signs of a break-in.\n\nWhen officers pulled over the truck they found Coughman behind the wheel and learned he was the owner of the damaged businesses, according to the news release. In the truck were several TVs that appeared to have been ripped from a wall.\n\nANTONIO BROWN LOSES ENDORSEMENT DEAL WITH HELMET MANUFACTURER XENITH AMID SEXUAL ASSAULT INVESTIGATION: REPORT\n\nThe news release quoted Coughman as informing the officers that he had noticed the damage earlier in the day and called his insurance company to report it but not 911.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It's possible he was trying to stage this as a hate crime,\" Cpl. Michele Pihera told the Daily Post. \"We don't know if he was trying to get attention for this. What we do know is, if that witness had not called us and if those officers had not responded as quickly as they did, we would probably be sitting here talking about a completely different crime in which Mr. Coughman would be trying to say he's a victim.\"", "description": "A former NFL player has been accused of trashing a restaurant and an ice cream shop he owned near Atlanta to make it look like a hate crime.", "authors": ["Robert Gearty"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/edawn-coughman3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
