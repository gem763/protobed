REUTERS/Saliou Samb\n\nAbdourahmane Sanoh, a former government minister and an organizer of the demonstrations last week, which resulted in at least nine deaths, received a one-year jail term for inciting civil disobedience, the judge in the case said.\n\nFour other members of the National Front for the Defence of the Constitution (FNDC), a coalition of politicians and activists opposed to a constitutional change, received six-month sentences. Three others were acquitted.\n\nBoth the defense and the prosecution, which had been seeking five-year sentences, said they planned to appeal.
