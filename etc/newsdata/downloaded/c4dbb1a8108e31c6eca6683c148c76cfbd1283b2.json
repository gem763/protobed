REUTERS/Adnan Abidi/File Photo\n\nThe company\u2019s board, which met earlier in the day, accepted the management\u2019s recommendation to shift the September-quarter results to Nov. 14, the telecom operator said.\n\nShares of New Delhi-based Airtel, which was expected to release its quarterly numbers later in the day, dropped as much as 4.22%, while smaller rival Vodafone Idea Ltd (VODA.NS) fell 9.52%.\n\nBoth companies have been steadily losing subscribers to Reliance Industries-owned (RELI.NS) Jio.\n\nIndia\u2019s Supreme Court last week upheld a demand by the country\u2019s telecoms department (DoT) that wireless carriers must pay 920 billion rupees ($12.97 billion) in overdue levies and interest.\n\nAirtel said on Tuesday it has approached the DoT to \u201cseek clarity\u201d on the amount it had to pay, adding that it has sought the government\u2019s support to deal with the \u201cadverse outcome\u201d of the court ruling.\n\nVodafone, already lugging over $14 billion in debt as of the previous financial year, said in a statement dated Oct. 25 that it would engage with the regulator for relief, including a waiver of interest and penalties.\n\n\u201cThe amount involved is pretty huge. If this goes on, (then) Vodafone could go bankrupt,\u201d said Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities.\n\nThe total debt in the sector is about 4 trillion rupees, according to trade body Cellular Operators Association (COAI) of India.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s judgment is the last straw in contributing to financial distress and it remains to be seen whether the industry will be able to recover from this setback,\u201d COAI said in an emailed statement.\n\nSECTOR CONSOLIDATION\n\nIndia\u2019s telecom sector has reduced to only four large players currently operating from about 10 a decade ago. That includes the state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd, which merged last week.\n\nThe court-ruled fee payments would further consolidate the industry and leave only two companies, namely Airtel and Jio, analysts told Reuters.\n\n\u201cTelecom usage in India is pretty high. So if it falls in the hands of only a few players, it is not good,\u201d said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.\n\n\u201cThe government has to look into this.\u201d\n\nKotak\u2019s Oza echoed the sentiments, adding that for good competition, the sector needed at least three players, if not four or five.\n\nJio, launched in 2015, is a relatively new player and would face a lighter burden in terms of levies.\n\n\u201cWe have to wait and see how it plays out, but Reliance (Jio) will have much less to pay,\u201d Oza added.\n\nJio\u2019s parent Reliance shares were up 2.35% on Tuesday.\n\n($1 = 70.7200 Indian rupees)", "description": "Bharti Airtel Ltd said on Tuesday it would need more time to release its September-quarter earnings report, as the Indian company weighs the impact of a recent court ruling asking telecom firms to pay $13 billion in dues to the government.", "authors": ["Derek Francis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446081552&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S066", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
