Although neither seem like they would support yearly sequels.\n\nEA\u2019s other big plan is to double down on live service games, as the microtransactions from games like FIFA and Madden NFL continue to account for the majority of their profits. Although at least they\u2019ve remembered that they did used to make other games as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter", "description": "Fans could finally see the return of Dead Space, at least as a remaster, as EA also confirm there\u2019ll be no Battlefield 6 next year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_447693_1572427029.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
