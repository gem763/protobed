However, the safety and wellbeing of beneficiaries and those that come into contact with the charity must always be a priority for the trustees and staff of a charity. This trustee has been disqualified with immediate effect for failing in his duty to protect those who came into contact with the charity.\u201d\n\nCelebrity readers of Lakar\u2019s book included the Radiohead singer, Thom Yorke, and the actor John Cleese. The Rigpa Fellowship announced Lakar\u2019s death, which came after complications during his cancer treatment, with \u201cdeep sadness\u201d on its website.\n\nLakar founded the fellowship, which runs a Buddhist centre in Islington, north London, in 1979. Lakar served as the charity\u2019s spiritual director before he \u201cretired\u201d in August 2017 following the allegations. Gaffney was appointed to the charity\u2019s \u201cvisionary board\u201d after Lakar stood down.\n\nThe charity, which runs courses and seminars, has centres around the world including in Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh.\n\nAn investigation conducted by the legal firm Lewis Silkin, commissioned by the fellowship, concluded last year that \u201csome students of Sogyal Lakar \u2026 have been subjected to serious physical, sexual and emotional abuse by him\u201d.\n\nIt added that \u201cthere were senior individuals within Rigpa who were aware of at least some of these issues and failed to address them, leaving others at risk\u201d.\n\nThe fellowship said: \u201cPatrick Gaffney was a trustee of the English charity but resigned last year. We have adopted a new grievance procedure that includes an independent council, who can receive complaints brought by members and the public.\u201d", "description": "Rigpa Fellowship\u2019s Patrick Gaffney had knowledge of improper acts, watchdog found", "authors": ["Simon Murphy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6de736dc30d0a3388f3830d08e254dfef021efc/254_111_2101_1260/master/2101.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5e558770fc3c40304b5af1ff979a0ff4"}
