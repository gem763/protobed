I can\u2019t seem to master that \u201cbear claw\u201d grip whereby you tuck your fingertips on the stabilising hand to prevent accidentally knifing yourself. After an unfortunate incident with a new chef\u2019s knife and a trip to urgent care, I decided to swallow all my pride and invest in a pair of Kevlar gloves.\n\nThe engraved knife was a gift. With which I cut myself about five minutes after receiving. (Photo: Melissa Kirsch)\n\nIs it humbling to wear a glove while cooking because you\u2019re so klutzy you can\u2019t trust yourself not to lop off a digit? Oh yes \u2014 but I needed humbling if I was to stay out of the ER. Does the glove sometimes get gross when you\u2019re cutting chicken or a slimy vegetable? Sure, but you throw it in the wash. I can\u2019t recommend you test the impenetrability of the Kevlar by running your finger down the blade of a knife or dicing drunk, but I will say that I have not cut myself since I started wearing the gloves. (I got these because I figured 11,000 positive reviews couldn\u2019t be fake, but now that I think about it, yes they could, so get the ones that speak to you.)\n\nI have not given up on building up my knife skills, so you have any tips or YouTube videos that changed everything for you, I\u2019m all ears (and fingers! Ten of them at last count!).", "description": "As many times as I have watched deft prep cooks slice tomatoes and chop onions with nary a nick, I remain stalwartly accident-prone in the kitchen.
