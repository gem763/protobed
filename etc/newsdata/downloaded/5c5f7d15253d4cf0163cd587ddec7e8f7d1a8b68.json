How dare you continue to look away?\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cBecause if you really understood the situation and went on failing to act, you would be evil, and that I refuse to believe.\u201d\n\nAppearing on Fox News\u2019 The Story on Monday evening, Knowles joined anchor Harris Faulkner and liberal commentator Christopher Hahn to discuss Monday\u2019s climate protests across the nation as well as Thunberg\u2019s speech. Knowles immediately went after the young climate activist.\n\n\u201cIf it were about science it would be led by scientists rather than by politicians and a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left,\u201d Knowles said, prompting Faulkner to ask Hahn to respond since he had a \u201cvisceral reaction\u201d to the right-wing talker\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean, you\u2019re a grown man and you\u2019re attacking a child\u2014shame on you,\u201d the liberal pundit said. Knowles insisted he was not attacking Thunberg but rather her parents and liberals.\n\n\u201cRelax, skinny boy, I got this,\u201d Hahn shouted. \u201cOK? You\u2019re attacking a child, you\u2019re a grown man!\u201d\n\nAs Hahn continued to demand that Knowles \u201ctake it back,\u201d the conservative podcaster stood by his remarks, repeating his claim that Thunberg is \u201cmentally ill\u201d while accusing the left of \u201cexploiting a girl with many mental illnesses.\u201d (For the record, Thunberg has been diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum, something she has called her \u201csuperpower.\u201d)\n\nThe two went back and forth over Knowles\u2019 attack on Thunberg. Faulkner, meanwhile, did not directly address Knowles\u2019 comments, instead refocusing the conversation on another topic.\n\nA Fox News spokesperson provided the following statement to The Daily Beast on Knowles\u2019 remarks: \u201cThe comment made by Michael Knowles who was a guest on The Story tonight was disgraceful\u2014we apologize to Greta Thunberg and to our viewers.\u201d\n\nFox News also told The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Jeremy Barr that it has no plans to book Knowles again as a guest.\n\nThroughout the day on Monday, conservatives on television and social media mocked and belittled the young climate activist.\n\nA popular right-wing Twitter troll said Thunberg needed a \u201cspanking,\u201d while the editor-in-chief of The Federalist quipped that Thunberg\u2019s emergence showed that we \u201cneed to have a national conversation about the rising problem of arrogant teenage Swedes.\u201d\n\nOn Fox & Friends, guest Marc Morano declared that Thunberg was \u201cinstilling fear in millions of kids.\u201d Later on Monday, host Greg Gutfeld\u2014who famously has failed to read articles to prepare for television segments\u2014criticized Thunberg\u2019s parents for allowing her to speak out publicly about climate change, saying kids know \u201cnothing about nuclear energy or the costs of solar or wind power.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel bad for her,\u201d he said, adding that co-host Juan Williams would be \u201cembarrassed\u201d if his kid acted like Thunberg.\n\nBut the teen-bashing didn\u2019t sit well with everyone on Fox News.\n\nWhen Outnumbered guest Buck Sexton mocked the idea of asking Thunberg about other topics, like the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, the show\u2019s co-hosts immediately pushed back against his tone.\n\n\u201cNo picking on children,\u201d host Melissa Francis said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a kid,\u201d Dagen McDowell added.\n\nA couple of hours after Knowles\u2019 remarks, Fox News primetime host Laura Ingraham took her own dig at Thunberg by comparing the teenage climate activist to the Stephen King horror film Children of the Corn.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for Stephen King\u2019s sequel, Children of the Climate,\u201d she said after playing a clip from the movie.\n\nLate on Monday night, meanwhile, all of the Twitter trolling and televised attacks reached its inevitable conclusion when President Trump took aim at Thunberg with a sarcastic tweet.\n\n\u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,\u201d he wrote while sharing video of her U.N. remarks. \u201cSo nice to see!\u201d", "description": "Throughout the day on Monday, conservatives on television and social media mocked and belittled the 16-year-old climate activist.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona", "Maxwell Tani", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569286243/story-martha-maccallum_5_wczdcn", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
