This will lead to increased morbidity and mortality in the future, she says.\n\nThe situation is critical\n\nGlynnis explained to us that these concerns are certainly not only in Cape Town and do extend to the rest of South Africa. However, the situation in Cape Town is critical, she says, with only two Obstetricians providing the needed Obstetric support for private clients choosing a Midwife as her primary caregiver.\n\nIn the government sector, it is the norm for low-risk pregnant women to be cared for by Midwives in the MOU\u2019s (Midwife Obstetric Units) first, and referred to secondary institutions if a complication is detected.\n\nThe team held a brainstorm session, inviting the public to contribute their ideas and skills, in an attempt to find a solution.\n\nSome of the suggestions include:\n\n- No win - No fee legal companies need to be investigated and a mandatory mediation clause adhered to for Obstetric care.\n\n- Obstetricians need support in challenging the astronomical indemnity insurance required.\n\n- Medical Aids need to be held accountable for the unacceptably high payouts for Caesarian Sections.\n\n- Hospital Groups need to acknowledge the importance of patient centered care and the value of Midwives, by supporting Doctors who are prepared to be inconvenienced by providing Obstetric support to Independent Midwives and their clients.\n\nAn ideal outcome would be to have a Team of Obstetricians supporting a Team of Midwives in providing low-risk pregnant women with evidenced based, patient centred care.\n\nWould you like to get involved?
