EXPLAINER-Attack on Saudi leaves world without spare oil capacity\n\n* OPEC oil production: https://tmsnrt.rs/2LArZY3\n\n* U.S. oil production: https://tmsnrt.rs/2VVVEiv\n\n* OPEC spare capacity (EIA): https://tmsnrt.rs/2VVkYFd\n\nLONDON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The strike on the heartland of\n\nSaudi Arabia's oil industry, including damage to the world's\n\nbiggest petroleum-processing facility, has driven oil prices to\n\ntheir highest level in nearly four months. Here are some facts about the impact on oil supply and spare\n\ncapacity:\n\nWHY IS IT SO DISRUPTIVE FOR GLOBAL OIL SUPPLIES?\n\nThe attack on Saudi oil facilities on Saturday not only\n\nknocked out over half of the country's production, it also\n\nremoved almost all the spare capacity available to compensate\n\nfor any major disruption in oil supplies worldwide.\n\nThe attack cut 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of Saudi\n\ncrude output, over 5 percent of the world's supply. But the\n\nattack also constrained Saudi Arabia's ability to use the more\n\nthan 2 million bpd of spare oil production capacity it held for\n\nemergencies.\n\nThe kingdom has for years been the only major oil producing\n\ncountry that has kept significant spare capacity that it could\n\nstart up quickly to compensate for any deficiency in supply\n\ncaused by war or natural disaster.\n\nMost other countries cannot afford to drill expensive wells\n\nand install infrastructure, then maintain it idle.\n\nBefore the attack, the Organization of the Petroleum\n\nExporting Countries (OPEC) global supply cushion was just over\n\n3.21 million barrels per day (bpd), according to the\n\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nSaudi Arabia - the defacto leader of OPEC - had 2.27 million\n\nbpd of that capacity. That leaves around 940,000 bpd of spare\n\ncapacity, mostly held by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIraq and Angola also have some spare capacity. They may now\n\nbring that production online to help plug some of the gap left\n\nby Saudi Arabia - but it won't be enough.\n\nHAVEN'T OPEC AND ITS ALLIES BEEN CUTTING OUTPUT? CAN'T THEY\n\nJUST REVERSE THOSE CUTS?\n\nYes, OPEC and its allies such as Russia have cut output to\n\nprevent prices from weakening because the market has been\n\noversupplied.\n\nThose cuts aimed to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd. But\n\nmuch of that was from Saudi Arabia so it now cannot be reversed\n\nquickly.\n\nNon-OPEC members such as Russia are pumping near capacity,\n\nwith perhaps only 100,000-150,000 bpd of available additional\n\nproduction.\n\nWHAT ABOUT IRAN?\n\nIran holds spare capacity but it cannot get the oil to\n\nmarket because of sanctions imposed by the government of U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump.\n\nIran's exports have fallen over 2 million bpd since April.\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/2VVkYFd\n\nWashington has said Iran was behind Saturday's attack, so is\n\nunlikely to ease sanctions to allow Iran to plug a gap it\n\nbelieves was created by Tehran.\n\nIran, for its part, said after the attack that it would pump\n\nat full volume if sanctions were eased.\n\nAND VENEZUELA?\n\nU.S. sanctions have also impacted the Venezuelan oil\n\nindustry. But Venezuelan output has been in freefall for years\n\nand state oil company PDVSA is unlikely to be able to boost\n\nproduction much even if sanctions were eased.\n\nWHAT ABOUT U.S. SHALE? CAN SHALE PRODUCERS PUMP MORE?\n\nThe United States has become the world's top crude producer\n\nafter years of rapid growth in supply from the shale sector,\n\nmuch of it pumped from fields in Texas. The U.S. has also grown\n\nas an exporter, and shipped more crude to international markets\n\nin June than Saudi Arabia.\n\nShale producers can move quickly to pump more when prices\n\nrise, and can bring production online in a matter of months.\n\nThat is a much faster time line than most traditional oil\n\nproduction.\n\nIf the Saudi outage looks like it will be prolonged and oil\n\nprices rally significantly, then shale producers will raise\n\noutput.\n\nBut even if shale producers pump more, there are constraints\n\non how much the United States can export because oil ports are\n\nalready near capacity.\n\nSO WHAT HAPPENS NOW? WHAT ABOUT OIL IN STORAGE?\n\nIt all depends on how long the outage lasts.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the United States and China all have hundreds\n\nof millions of barrels of oil in strategic storage. That is the\n\nstorage that governments keep for exactly this scenario - to\n\ncompensate for unexpected outages in supply.\n\nThey can release oil from strategic storage to meet demand\n\nand temper the impact on prices. U.S. President Donald Trump\n\nsaid on Sunday he had authorised a release from the U.S.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\nThe IEA, which coordinates energy policies of industrialised\n\nnations, advises all its members to keep the equivalent of 90\n\ndays of net oil imports in storage.\n\nOil from storage should keep the market supplied for some\n\ntime, but oil markets will likely become increasingly volatile\n\nas storage is run down and the possibility of a supply crunch\n\nrises.\n\nThe IEA said on Saturday the markets were still well\n\nsupplied despite the Saudi disruptions.\n\n\"We are massively oversupplied,\" said Christyan Malek, head\n\nof oil and gas research for Europe, Middle East and Africa at\n\nJ.P. Morgan, adding it would take five months of a 5 million-bpd\n\noutage to take global crude supply levels back to a 40-year\n\nnormal average.\n\n\"Having said that, this attack introduces a new,\n\nirreversible risk premium into the market,\" he added.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS ANOTHER SUPPLY DISRUPTION?\n\nWith no spare capacity, future disruptions would cause oil\n\nprices to rise. A higher price over time will encourage\n\nproducers to invest and pump more, while at the same time\n\nreducing consumption.\n\nOPEC member Libya is in the middle of a civil war, which\n\nthreatens its ability to continue pumping oil. Another big\n\nLibyan disruption would add to the shocks and highlight the lack\n\nof spare capacity.\n\nNigerian exports have also suffered from disruptions.\n\nEven before the Saudi attack, spare capacity was falling.\n\nConsultancy Energy Aspects has said it expects OPEC spare\n\ncapacity to fall to below 1 million bpd in the fourth quarter\n\nfrom two million bpd in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nOPEC Oil Production https://tmsnrt.rs/2LArZY3\n\nOPEC Oil Production png https://tmsnrt.rs/2VXGPMh\n\nU.S. Oil Production https://tmsnrt.rs/2VVVEiv\n\nU.S. Oil Production png https://tmsnrt.rs/2Wzk9yX\n\nSpare Capacity -GS https://tmsnrt.rs/2Wz3H1H\n\nOPEC oil production capacity interactive https://tmsnrt.rs/2VVkYFd\n\nOPEC oil production capacity png https://tmsnrt.rs/2VVl0wP\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "EXPLAINER-Attack on Saudi leaves world without spare oil capacity", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB050EH_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
