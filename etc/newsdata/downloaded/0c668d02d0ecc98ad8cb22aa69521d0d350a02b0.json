Fred Keller: Pelosi's impeachment inquiry is nonsense \u2013 Let's pass legislation and stop the madness", "language": "en", "text": "The past several weeks in Washington have shown us the worst of the swamp.\n\nI took the oath of office in June, after winning a special election in Pennsylvania. During my five months in office, I have seen Washington Democrats do nothing but focus on baseless partisan investigations that have wasted valuable time and millions of taxpayer dollars.\n\nIt started with the \u201cRussia Collusion\u201d hoax, which failed, and has turned into an \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d being conducted behind closed doors with a predetermined outcome meant to deny the will of the American people 13 months before an election.\n\nTOM DEL BECCARO: REPUBLICANS MUST WIN THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL \u2013 AND THEY CAN BY FOLLOWING THESE FIVE STEPS\n\nSpeaker Pelosi announced the start of the so-called \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d without a vote on the House floor.\n\nThis sham process has progressed behind closed doors while denying President Trump his due process rights, limiting the ability of the minority party to act as a check on the majority, and rejecting even the most basic standards of transparency as Washington Democrats try to undo the results of the 2016 election.\n\nMembers of Congress have been kicked out of non-classified hearings. Transcripts have not been released. As a member of the House Oversight Committee, one of the committees spearheading the impeachment inquiry, I have been denied the opportunity to review testimony given by former Ambassador Kurt Volker.\n\nThe American public deserves to review the facts and weigh the evidence. Instead, their elected representatives are being denied access to vital information while Democrats selectively leak testimony intended to drive their impeachment narrative.\n\nWhen the government abandons due process for political expediency, the very foundation of our republic becomes unstable.\n\nThe people in my district, both Republicans and Democrats, have repeatedly told me they are sick and tired of the way this non-transparent inquiry is going and the fact that Congress fails to do anything other than focus on tearing down the duly-elected president.\n\nAside from the alarming impact the current \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d presents to our form of government is the immediate and practical effect of what it has done to governing.\n\nWhile Speaker Pelosi said that the 116th Congress would be one that unifies, rather than divides our nation, her leadership\u2014or lack thereof\u2014has put real legislating at a standstill.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe House continues to have before it legislation that could turn into real game-changers for the American worker, American family, and American economy. But Speaker Pelosi\u2019s impeachment morass has overshadowed lawmaking, divided her own caucus, and alienated Republicans. This is not a fruitful environment for working together to achieve great things for the American people.\n\nLike many Americans, I am appalled that Congress is consumed with impeachment instead of legislating.\n\nCongress has the opportunity to pass real, meaningful legislation this fall. The USMCA would boost our economy and help our farmers and manufacturing sectors. A bipartisan infrastructure bill could literally pave the way to better roads and bridges to ensure safe travel of persons and goods. And immigration reform could finally end the security and humanitarian crisis on our border.\n\nThe people in my district, both Republicans and Democrats, have repeatedly told me they are sick and tired of the way this non-transparent inquiry is going and the fact that Congress fails to do anything other than focus on tearing down the duly-elected president.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nUnfortunately for them, Democrats want impeachment over improvement and have traded unity for uselessness.\n\nIt\u2019s time to stop the nonsense, it\u2019s time to stop the madness, it\u2019s time to stop this opaque inquiry and sham process for the benefit of the American people.", "description": "Like many Americans, I am appalled that Congress is consumed with impeachment instead of legislating.", "authors": ["Fred Keller", "Republican Fred Keller Represents Pennsylvania S Congressional District In The U.S. House Of Representatives.
