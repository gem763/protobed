I\u2019m not sure exactly what I imagined that would look like but it wasn\u2019t this press availability on an airplane. I guess the subtext here is that Trudeau isn\u2019t letting this interrupt his campaign schedule. He\u2019s got places to go so this apology will have to be handled on the way to those other priorities.\n\nAs for the content of his apology, he mostly seems to repeat a handful of lines about ten times, in both English and French: He\u2019s sorry. He should have known better. What he did was racist. Etc. At one point a reporter asked if he\u2019d ever done this any other time and Trudeau replied, \u201cWhen I was in high school I dressed up for a talent show and sang \u201cDay-O\u201d with make-up on.\u201d A photo of Trudeau dressed as Harry Belafonte has now surfaced.\n\nJustin Trudeau in blackface. pic.twitter.com/5WigbaF49U \u2014 Stephen Taylor (@stephen_taylor) September 19, 2019\n\nAlso, another photo from the 2001 party has turned up:\n\nThere is a second photo of Justin Trudeau in brownface, from the same 2001 incident. This is from the school\u2019s newsletter (he was a teacher at the time) https://t.co/Thg7mzVcJe pic.twitter.com/YZMda2hpkU \u2014 Katie Simpson (@CBCKatie) September 19, 2019\n\nAs Ed has pointed out earlier, a third photo has also surfaced and been confirmed so it seems Trudeau left out at least one example in his apology. I wonder how many more there are.\n\nPerhaps the best question asked yesterday came from a reporter who pointed out that Trudeau\u2019s campaign has been \u201chammering the conservatives\u201d for \u201cinappropriate\u201d posts on social media and has promised much more to come. \u201cHow could you credibly do something like that now, in the middle of a campaign, after what we\u2019ve all seen tonight?\u201d he asked.\n\nTrudeau replied, \u201cI\u2019ve taken responsibility for it, for having made a real mistake in the past. I stand here before Canadians as I will throughout this campaign and talk about the work we have to do to make a better country together and I\u2019m going to continue to stay focused on that and continue to work to fight intolerance and discrimination even though obviously I made a mistake in the past.\u201d\n\nTrudeau was also asked why he didn\u2019t raise his own use of blackface when the issue became news surrounding the Gov. of Virginia earlier this year. \u201cDid you think at that time \u2018Geez, I\u2019m a politician and I\u2019ve done that, maybe I should say something?'\u201d\n\nTrudeau replied: \u201cThis is part of the reflections we all have to have on how we judge the mistakes that we\u2019ve made in the past\u2026\u201d Um, okay, but that wasn\u2019t the question.\n\nAsked by another reporter, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell people sooner?\u201d Trudeau responded, \u201cI\u2019m talking about it now.\u201d\n\nThis is probably as good an answer as a progressive can give in a situation like this, i.e. the fight to defeat racism, including my own, must go on. Of course, the real question is why anyone choose someone who dressed in blackface repeatedly as their white knight on this issue. The real problem for Trudeau is that his own campaign\u2019s attacks on the conservatives are going to ring a bit hollow now. If the standard is that Trudeau himself hasn\u2019t been disqualified for office because he offered this self-serving apology, then anyone else caught out can do the same.\n\nYou can\u2019t play cancel culture games when you\u2019re begging the public not to cancel you for your own mistakes.\n\nThis CBS News report contains a bit of Trudeau\u2019s apology and some reactions to it:\n\nThe full apology presser appears to have lasted about 10-12 minutes. The first six minutes can be seen below. Another 5-6 minutes to the end when Trudeau walks away is available here.", "description": "\"Why didn't you tell people sooner?\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Hot Air Staff", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Trudeau-apology.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
