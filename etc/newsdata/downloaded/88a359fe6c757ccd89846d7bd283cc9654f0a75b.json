No doubt the company was rocked to the core when the crisis emerged in March.\n\nBut this is Ted Baker, which just a year ago was still regarded a high street hero \u2013 admirably keeping pace with the rapid shifts in the retail industry and defying all that doom and gloom.\n\nShareholders continued to pour in, safe in the knowledge that whatever happened in the sector resilient, popular Ted Baker would inevitably come out one of retail\u2019s winners.\n\nA short term wobble \u2013 such as that experienced even by Primark in November \u2013 could have been deemed acceptable given the tough trading environment. A bad quarter here or there, perhaps.\n\nBut three profit warnings in seven months?\n\nThose are the sort of headlines reserved for older, far weaker operators \u2013 Bonmarche, New Look, House of Fraser, Mothercare \u2013 the firms that had already fallen behind and required radical structural change in order to weather the High Street storm.\n\nSo, with each passing month, it's starting to look more and more like Ted Baker\u2019s problems could stem from within.\n\nLet's take its half-year results: Other than in the US, Ted Baker reported sales declines across all its markets. Even more worryingly, online sales fell.\n\nCan all that be pinned on 'external conditions' and \u2018unseasonable weather\u2019?\n\nThe crash in its shares yesterday \u2013 a 35 per cent fall \u2013 betrayed investors\u2019 suspicions too that this may no longer be just a bump in the road that Ted Baker can easily ride out.\n\nApart from the US, Ted Baker reported sales declines in all its markets over the past six months\n\nAlarm bells started ringing for me when, at a race day two years ago, a friend and I played \u2018Spot The Ted Baker Dress\u2019 \u2013 the brand's distinctive floral designs standing out a mile.\n\nWe spotted at least 15 women wearing the exact same navy blue Ted Baker gown that day \u2013 and while they all looked fantastic, they stole each other\u2019s thunder, just as they would have done if they\u2019d arrived at a wedding in the same dress.\n\nI've seen it happen to men too. The problem with Ted's standout shirts with snazzy collars and cuff embellishments is that they... stand out, prompting that agonising Ted Baker \u2018snap\u2019 moment at many an office party.\n\nThere was THAT Ted Baker coat as well (you know the one), which around 40 per cent of the women in my office wore two winters back.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly what you hope for when you splash out on something \u2018a little bit different\u2019.\n\nIt was back then I first suspected we were about to reach peak Ted Baker, and I believe its appeal has waned since - like with any restaurant chain that rapidly over-expands and subsequently loses its charm.\n\nI\u2019ve also become unsure about the audience Ted Baker is trying to target.\n\nIts gone down the strange Superdry route of ranges for children \u2013 a sure fire way to disengage teenage and young shoppers.\n\nIt\u2019s also marketing at middle aged men \u2013 as if might be desirable for young guys to step out in the same brand as their dads.\n\nTed Baker, like Superdry, has a range of children's clothes - as demonstrated above\n\nThe brand is also targeting slightly older shoppers as it branches out into fresh markets\n\nTo be fair, perhaps it is, but I do think it\u2019s quite an accomplishment for any brand to bridge that gap and appeal to \u2018every man\u2019.\n\nAnalysts were nervous when teenage favourite Boohoo bought Karen Millen earlier this year because they feared the firm might neglect its loyal core shopper base.\n\nClearly, it's far from doomsday for Ted Baker, and it's still early days for new boss Page too. Decisive action to distance the firm from chaotic department stores, for example, will certainty do it some favours.\n\nBut if Ted Baker wants to win loyal shoppers, it needs to stop looking out of the window at the weather, and take a long, hard look in the mirror instead.", "description": "If Ted Baker wants to win loyal shoppers, it needs to stop looking out of the window at the weather, and take a long, hard look in the mirror instead.", "authors": ["Emily Hardy", "This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
