Reuters interviewed or reviewed the MPP documents of more than two dozen people.\n\nSince January, U.S. officials have sent some 42,000 asylum-seekers back to Mexican border cities where they can wait for a U.S. court date for weeks or months.\n\nLast week the policy was put in turmoil when the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to enforce a ban on all applications since July from asylum seekers who have passed through a third country, including Mexico.\n\n\"They were here in the plaza, and the desperation led them to death,\" said Yamali Flores, 33, a Honduran who has been waiting for weeks with her family in a tent in Matamoros for an asylum hearing scheduled for December.\n\nThe camp lies just over a sandy bluff from the Rio Grande, a lap swim away from Texas, a U.S. flag fluttering visibly from Mexico.\n\nIt was not immediately possible for Reuters to confirm if Herrera and her son gave up on waiting and tried swimming to the United States, or if they drowned while bathing or washing.\n\nThe Honduran foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the facts of the deaths.\n\nSome in the camp described to Reuters a sense of deepening anxiety under shifting U.S. immigration policies.\n\n\"May God take care of you,\" Hernandez said she told her daughter as the young woman set off with her baby in August.\n\nHerrera had hired a smuggler of migrants and had plans to meet her husband Elmer Cordova, who had worked as a barber in a village hut of sticks and mud.\n\nThree months earlier, he had made it to North Carolina with two of their daughters, aged five and seven, fleeing poverty, according to Hernandez.\n\n\"They were going to be together,\" Hernandez said, in a telephone interview. \"Now I don't know what I'm going to do without my daughter and my dead grandson. May God give me strength to move forward.\"\n\nThe Foreign Ministry said the bodies, which are in the United States, will be repatriated in about 15 days.
