The season premiere of SNL featured Larry David and Maya Rudolph, but current cast member Pete Davidson was nowhere to be found. The show\u2019s young gun (not to be confused with Machine Gun Kelly, Pete\u2019s BFF) was actually off pursuing another dream of his. He was filming the new Suicide Squad movie with director James Gunn and co-stars Margot Robbie, Jai Courtney, Daniela Melchior, Steve Agee, Sean Gunn, Joel Kinnaman, Flula Borg, and Nathan Fillion. And we know this thanks to Gunn\u2019s social-media presence.\n\nOn Saturday, the squad (plus Pom Klementieff from Guardians of the Galaxy) saw a screening of Joker in Atlanta. Pete\u2019s role in the new film still remains a mystery, so there is no telling when the prodigal son will return to 30 Rock. But are we that desperate to spend a portion of \u201cWeekend Update\u201d hearing how Andie MacDowell feels about her daughter dating Davidson? We can do that right now. \u201cShe has a beautiful relationship with him but I don\u2019t want to step on her relationship too much,\u201d Andie MacDowell told People at Paris Fashion Week. \u201cThey have a nice relationship.\u201d That\u2019s Pete Davidson, everyone! From \u201cWeekend Update,\u201d I\u2019m Colin Jost! He\u2019s Michael Che! Good night!", "description": "\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 cast member Pete Davidson was missing from the season premiere this week because he was off filming \u2018Suicide Squad\u2019 with James Gunn.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/30/30-pete-davidson.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
