Nepal is on a mission to measure the world\u2019s tallest mountain.", "language": "en", "text": "But they completed their mission: to obtain crucial pieces of data that will help determine Mount Everest\u2019s true height.\n\nThe most commonly accepted figure for Mount Everest\u2019s height is 29,029 feet, a measurement that dates to the 1950s. Some scientists believe that the world\u2019s tallest mountain may have shrunk slightly after a powerful earthquake struck Nepal in 2015.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow, for the first time, Nepal has sent its own teams outfitted with the latest surveying technology to come up with a new measurement of the peak. The two-year, $1.3 million effort is driven both by patriotism and scientific inquiry, experts say.\n\nThe southern flank of Mount Everest \u201cbelongs to Nepal, but for 170 years foreigners have been measuring its height,\u201d said Roger Bilham, a geologist at the University of Colorado. The current project could be \u201cthe most accurate measurement ever made.\u201d\n\nSometime early next year, the new height will emerge from a modest cluster of offices on the ground floor of a government building in Kathmandu, home to the country\u2019s Survey Department. Susheel Dangol, the chief survey officer, recently installed a keypad-entry system for his department just to safeguard the Everest data.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEveryone is curious about the project,\u201d he said with a grin. During an interview, his cellphone rang with a call from a senior official in the country\u2019s Land Ministry inquiring about the progress of the work. Dangol has developed a stock response to those who ask about the final figure: At the moment, I\u2019m unable to say.\n\nDangol, 38, oversees a team of 80 people who have hiked, driven and helicoptered across Nepal to gather the data required for an updated measurement. Among their challenges: transporting a $200,000 Canadian-made gravimeter \u2014 which measures the force of gravity at a given location \u2014 along juddering Himalayan roads to nearly 300 different spots.\n\nThe question of Everest\u2019s height is intimately linked to its modern history. It is known in Nepal as Sagarmatha and in Tibet as Chomolungma. The search for the mountain\u2019s English name began after it was declared the world\u2019s tallest peak by surveyors in India in 1856. (Its namesake is George Everest, the prior chief surveyor of India, but even he wasn\u2019t crazy about having the mountain named after him.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDangol\u2019s team is tackling its task with two methods. The first is to measure Everest the old-fashioned way using trigonometry. Such calculations produced the first-ever tally of Everest\u2019s height, as well as the measurement taken in the 1950s by an Indian team that serves as the current standard.\n\nBut that technique will serve as \u201ca check, a redundancy,\u201d said Christopher Pearson, a research fellow at the University of Otago in New Zealand who consulted with Nepal on the project. The pathbreaking part of the effort will come through the second method, which relies on a combination of readings from a satellite navigation system and a complex model of sea level.\n\nEnter Gautam, a 15-year veteran of the survey department. The 35-year-old had already summitted Everest once before in 2011. This time, however, his four-person team was carrying 90 pounds of equipment in addition to their regular climbing gear. They planned their ascent to arrive at the summit in the middle of the night so their work would not be disturbed by other climbers.\n\nWhile most climbers limit their time at the roof of the world to descend quickly from the \u201cdeath zone,\u201d Gautam and his team \u201cdid not have that privilege,\u201d he recalled. They stayed at the summit for an hour and 45 minutes, taking readings with a Global Navigation Satellite System device and a ground-penetrating radar that can gauge the difference between the actual rock summit and the snow that covers it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWearing bulky mittens against the extreme cold, Gautam and his team couldn\u2019t operate the small knobs on their equipment. So they took off the mittens and worked in fleece gloves instead. For weeks afterward, Gautam had no sensation in his fingers. The frigid temperatures also damaged his feet: He lost the tip of his left big toe to frostbite and now wears only sandals, rather than shoes.\n\nOn the descent, all their food and water was gone, and Gautam\u2019s colleague ran out of oxygen, a life-threatening situation. Their climbing guide managed to borrow a bottle from another Sherpa who was heading up the mountain, Gautam said, saving his colleague\u2019s life.\n\nAlthough the data they carried with them on the way down weighed nothing, \u201cits preciousness made it so heavy,\u201d said Gautam.\n\nAD\n\nYet the satellite readings from the Everest expedition are not sufficient. They give the mountain\u2019s \u201cellipsoidal\u201d height \u2014 the height of the summit above a smoothed geometric model of the Earth. The readings do not reveal an object\u2019s precise height above sea level.\n\nAD\n\nJudging exactly where sea level would begin beneath Everest\u2019s massive tons of rock turns out to be a key question. Generating the model of sea level required lugging a gravimeter, which is carried in a large suitcase-like box, to 297 spots in Nepal. \u201cWe have to be cautious and drive slowly,\u201d Dangol said. At each measuring point, the machine must be calibrated before taking readings for two sessions of three minutes each.\n\nThe data collection will be completed next month, Dangol said. Then the processing will begin: six people, sitting in a room equipped with high-speed computers and specialized software, for three to four months, checking and rechecking the figures. It will be a \u201cclosed camp,\u201d Dangol said. Not even he will know the results at first.\n\nAD\n\nNepal\u2019s effort has been \u201cincredible,\u201d said Pearson, the surveying expert in New Zealand. \u201cStaggeringly, it has all worked, and they have all the information they need to get an accurate height.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDangol is already looking forward to next year, when Nepal plans to unveil Everest\u2019s new height \u2014 both the rock height and the snow height, down to the centimeter. That will be \u201ckind of like a thesis defense,\u201d he said.\n\nEven the loss of part of his toe did not dull Gautam\u2019s pride in his work. \u201cWe are so happy because we finished our difficult task,\u201d he said. \u201cI was ready to take [a] risk for the nation.\u201d\n\nAnkit Adhikari contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The two-year,\u00a0$1.3 million effort is driven both by patriotism and scientific inquiry.", "authors": ["Joanna Slater", "Foreign Correspondent Covering South Asia"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/b-pE5nUvgzC1tuokgesEroIvpAo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PJFTMGHRDEI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
