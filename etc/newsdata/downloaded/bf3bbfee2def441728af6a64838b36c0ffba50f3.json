Not the three owners of this Ferrari 328 GTS over the last 30 years.\n\nThey've clocked up a combined- and frankly meagre - 283 miles in total, making this one of the best time-warp examples of an iconic '80s supercar we've seen for some time.\n\nAnd it could soon be yours, if you have pockets deep enough. That's because it's being sold at auction in the UK next month, and the expected purchase fee is set to hit \u00a3150,000.\n\nScarcely-used supercar: This 1989 328 GTS, which still has delivery stickers on its front wheel, has barely been used in 30 years and is being described as the ultimate time-warp '80s Ferrari\n\nIt has covered a mere 455 kilometres from new, which converts to a paltry 282 miles - that's an average of nine miles each year since it rolled off the Maranello production line\n\nAuction house H&H Classics says this is 'possibly the lowest-mileage Ferrari 328 GTS in existence'.\n\nThe odometer shows it has covered no more than 455 kilometres in its lifetime, which converts to a paltry 283 miles.\n\nThe law of averages says it has done no more than nine miles for each year since it was built, making it hugely desirable to anyone with a garage full of of pristine classics - especially collectors of iconic Ferraris.\n\nAnd the targa-roofed 328 GTS undeniably has iconic status, having become a cult hero as part of '80s pop culture.\n\nIts hero reputation was built on its appearances in TV and cinema favourites from the era, notably Dallas, Falcon Crest, Beverley Hills Cop II, Nikita and LA Story.\n\nThe targa-roofed Ferrari 328 GTS undeniably has iconic status, having become a cult hero as part of '80s pop culture\n\nThe Ferrari 328 GTS appeared in TV and cinema favourites from the era. This includes hitting the screen in Dallas, Falcon Crest, Beverley Hills Cop II, Nikita and LA Story\n\nThe Ferrari 328 GTS appeared in US hit TV show Dallas, which ran from the late '70s through to the early '90s (left). It also had a few brief appearances in 1987 Eddie Murphy film Beverly Hills Cop II (right)\n\nIntroduced at the September 1985 Frankfurt Motor Show, the Ferrari 328 quickly became the 'junior supercar' to have at the time.\n\nThat's because it was an amalgamation of parts from some of the Italian marque's greatest models all encased in a stunning Pininfarina-designed shell.\n\nFor instance, its tubular-steel chassis, double-wishbone independent suspension, anti-roll bars and potent disc brakes were all taken from the 308. And the steering rack and cabin were shared with the GTO-specification 288.\n\nThe Pininfarina-designed Ferrari 328 GTS had a top speed of 158mph and was the 'junior supercar' to have at the end of the 1980s\n\nThe 3.2-lite V8 engine mounted in the middle of the car produced 270bhp when new and could hit 60mph from a standstill in just 5.5 seconds\n\nPowering the Maranello masterpiece is a mid-mounted 3.2-litre V8 engine credited with developing 270bhp and 224lbft of torque when new.\n\nAllied to a five-speed manual gearbox it could hit 60mph from a standstill in 5.5 seconds and onto a then eye-watering 158mph top speed, according to sales brochures.\n\nProduction ended in 1989, making this example one of the last of the 6,068 GTS derivatives made.\n\nThe first owner flipped it for twice what they paid for it shortly after acquiring the car in '89. The second owner then held onto it through two global financial crashes before handing the keys over after 24 years of ownership\n\nMost of those 24 years were spent in storage, which explains why the seats look barely sat in, there's not a ring scratch on the leather steering wheel and the array of buttons and switches look almost untouched\n\nChassis number 81550 was supplied new by Ferrari's main dealer in Rome, though quickly changed hands immediately after for double the list price as the first buyer made the most of demand to flip the Prancing Horse for a profit.\n\nSoon after the first keeper made a mint on it, the global crash hit, decimating the value of all things collectible, including supercars.\n\nRather than face a sizeable loss, the Ferrari's second owner chose to place it into professional storage - and it barely turned a wheel for the 24 years it was hidden away.\n\nHaving ridden out a second global recession in the late 2000s, the second keeper decided it was time to part with 328 just over five years ago - right at the height of the classic car market when experts said that collectible vehicles were a better investment than fine wines, bespoke jewels and even gold.\n\nThe vendor has had the car for around five years, keeping it as part of a 'significant private collection', according to the auction house selling it\n\nEven the gear knob looks like it's barely had a palm on it, with the beautifully traditional gated transmission box showing almost no sign of wear at all\n\nThe current vendor - who has a 'significant private motor collection - thinks that now is the prime time to let it go following a relatively brief spell of handling the keys.\n\nNot that it is - you can find out why in the boxout at the bottom of this page.\n\n'A true time-warp, the 328 GTS still has delivery stickers affixed to its driver's side front and spare wheels,' H&H Classics details in its description of the outstanding auction lot.\n\n'Both inner sills carry plastic protective covers and the internal trunking which draws air from the side vents to the engine has yet to discolour.\n\n'As well as its original tool kit, jack and Goodyear tyres, the Ferrari boasts a spare bulb kit, torch and Prancing Horse logoed Red bag.'\n\nHow factory fresh is it? Both door sills still have the plastic protective covers that were put on the car before it was delivered to the first keeper in Rome in 1989\n\nThe engine bay is wonderfully clean, as it should be given the few miles the car has covered during its lifetime\n\nIt went on to add: 'Understandably described by the seller as 'nigh on as new', this is the lowest mileage 328 GTS we have encountered.'\n\nThe showroom-fresh 328 GTS has had some recent work done to it, though.\n\nIt's only just returned fro ma \u00a35,000 cambelt service and brake overhaul to ensure the next owner can drive it away without any fears - not that they're likely to want to increase the tiny mileage by much.\n\nProduction of the 328 GTS ended in 1989, making this example one of the last of the 6,068 GTS derivatives made in Maranello\n\nThe almost unused Ferrari 328 GTS still has delivery stickers affixed to its driver's side front wheels, and the spare (pictured)\n\nThe car will be sold to the highest bidder at the auction house's Imperial War Museum Duxford sale on 16 October.\n\nThe lower estimate has been set at \u00a3120,000, though H&H will be hoping for closer to the upper prediction of \u00a3150,000.\n\nHagerty Classic Valuations says a pristine version is worth around \u00a3128,000, though anyone interested should rightfully expect there to be a little bit of a premium given that the tread on the tyres is barely worn.\n\nThe seat-belt mounts show barely any sign of stress whatsoever. A new owner could be buckling them up if the car sells at auction on 16 October\n\nAs well as its original jack and Goodyear tyres, the Ferrari boasts a spare bulb kit, torch and Prancing Horse logoed Red bag. Even the tool kit - which hasn't been used - is the one sold with the vehicle in 1989", "description": "If you had a supercar, you'd probably drive it, right?
