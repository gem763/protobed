The island chain\u2019s homes are built to withstand winds of at least 150mph (241km/h). Americans should \u201cpray for the people in the Bahamas\u201d, Donald Trump said from Washington as south-eastern US states looked on nervously.\n\nPlay Video 1:25 Hurricane Dorian wreaks havoc on Bahamas as 'catastrophic' Category 5 storm \u2013 video\n\nBahamian prime minister Hubert Minnis said in a nationally televised news conference that a \u201cmonster storm\u201d was battering the region. \u201cThis will put us to a test that we\u2019ve never confronted before,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is probably the most sad and worst day of my life to address the Bahamian people. I just want to say as a physician I\u2019ve been trained to withstand many things, but never anything like this.\u201d\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami said Dorian made a second landfall at 2pm US ET (1800 GMT) on Sunday, hitting Great Abaco Island with large waves and winds of 185mph with higher gusts. That was tied for the strongest Atlantic hurricane landfall on record, with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane.\n\nAs hundreds hunkered down in schools, churches and other shelters, Bahamian authorities made a last-minute plea for those in low-lying areas to evacuate. Reporters in the Bahamas said hundreds of residents of lower-lying islands, including Grand Cay and Sweeting Cay, had ignored mandatory orders to go.\n\n\u201cOnce the winds get to a certain strength we\u2019re not going to to be able to respond,\u201d Don Cornish, head of the Bahamas national emergency management agency, warned in a pre-storm briefing. \u201cWe may not have the resources to come after persons who are in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nThe NHC said Dorian was moving west at 7mph, with \u201ccatastrophic conditions\u201d expected across Grand Bahama later on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really, really bad for the Bahamas,\u201d Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach told the Associated Press, adding: \u201cAbaco is going to get wiped.\u201d\n\nHurricane hunter crews from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) flying into the storm\u2019s eyewall recorded winds gusting at more than 200mph, while an expected slowing in Dorian\u2019s progress raised the prospect of the system stalling over the Bahamas for up to 48 hours and dumping up to 30 inches (76cm) of rain.\n\n\u201cIt is not very often that we measure such strong winds,\u201d NHC expert Lixion Avila said in an advisory issued at 5pm ET.\n\nFloridians not fazed as Hurricane Dorian\u2019s path keeps state guessing Read more\n\nOn Sunday morning, a significant change to the forecast by NHC experts brought the cyclone much closer to Florida\u2019s south-eastern coast by Monday and Tuesday, prompting new hurricane and tropical storm force watches from just north of Miami to Sebastian inlet, 100 miles north of West Palm Beach. Dorian\u2019s predicted path would then take it north, skirting the US coast towards Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s governor, Henry McMaster, ordered the evacuation of his state\u2019s entire coastline from Monday at noon.\n\nSC Governor Press (@scgovernorpress) Gov. Henry McMaster Orders Mandatory Evacuations for Coastal Counties Effective Tomorrow, September 2 at Noon\n\n| Governor Also Ordered School and State Government Office Closures in Coastal Counties https://t.co/yzHoBtyLi6\n\nThough Avila said later that \u201cthe official track forecast does not show landfall\u201d, the forecaster added that \u201ca small deviation to the left of the track could bring the intense core of the hurricane its dangerous winds closer to or on to the Florida coast\u201d.\n\nIn Florida, some observers likened life at the mercy of the slow but unpredictable storm to being stalked by a turtle.\n\n\u201cSince Dorian is forecast to slow down and turn northward as it approaches the coast,\u201d Richard Pasch, senior adviser at the NGC, wrote in a morning advisory, \u201clife-threatening storm surge and and dangerous hurricane-force winds are still possible along portions of the Florida east coast by the middle part of this week.\n\n\u201cThere is an increasing risk of string winds and dangerous storm surge along the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina later this week.\u201d\n\nTrump sowed confusion earlier when he said incorrectly that Alabama would be hit by the storm, forcing the National Weather Service to issue an update. He later repeated the mistake at a press conference. He also repeated his claim that he was not sure he had \u201cever even heard of a category 5\u201d hurricane.\n\nPalm Beach officials have announced evacuation orders for coastal areas and mobile homes and said shelters were being opened because of the risk of a closer brush with Dorian than had been predicted. Counties further north, including Martin and Brevard, began evacuations on Saturday.\n\nThe increasing strength of the storm makes this the fourth consecutive year that at least one Atlantic cyclone has reached category 5, according to the NHC. Hurricane Matthew in 2016 followed a similar offshore track to Dorian\u2019s expected path yet still caused hundreds of billions of dollars in damage and 47 deaths in the US from wind, storm surge and significant inland flooding.\n\nIn 2017 Irma and Maria tore through the Caribbean, the latter blamed for more than 3,000 deaths in Puerto Rico, and last year Hurricane Michael wrecked areas of the Florida Panhandle that are still struggling to recover.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boats are seen tied up in preparation for the approach of Hurricane Dorian in Nassau, Bahamas.
