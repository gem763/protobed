But to get to space, the rocket launching this satellite won\u2019t take off from the ground like most others do. Instead, it\u2019ll launch from underneath the wing of a giant airplane, climbing to space from midair.\n\nThe mission is named ICON \u2014 for Ionospheric Connection Explorer \u2014 and it was originally supposed to launch in the summer of 2017. However, technical issues with the rocket, called Pegasus, forced the launch to be put on hold for the last two years. Now, Northrop Grumman, which operates the Pegasus system, says the rocket is ready to fly after making a few modifications to the vehicle and performing a variety of qualification tests.\n\nIf ICON finally gets off the ground this week, scientists are particularly eager about what the satellite might tell us about Earth\u2019s mysterious ionosphere \u2014 a huge layer of our planet\u2019s atmosphere that begins 30 miles up and spans all the way to 600 miles high. This part of our planet\u2019s atmosphere overlaps with the boundary of space and is responsible for what is known as space weather. It\u2019s here where charged particles streaming from the Sun interact with particles in our atmosphere, charging them up and creating strange phenomena such as the aurora and geomagnetic storms.\n\n\u201cWhat we know about the ionosphere is that it really changes from one day to the next quite a bit.\u201d\n\nThe challenge, though, is that scientists have a hard time forecasting how the ionosphere is going to behave. \u201cWhat we know about the ionosphere is that it really changes from one day to the next quite a bit,\u201d Thomas Immel, the principal investigator for ICON at the University of California Berkeley, tells The Verge. \u201cAnd the other thing we know is that those changes are hard to predict.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a problem since space weather events can have a very real impact on electronics and systems here on Earth. Various satellites fly through the ionosphere, as well as astronauts on the International Space Station. GPS signals also travel through this region. Disturbances in the ionosphere can muck up these signals and equipment and even disrupt our power grid on the surface below.\n\nOne way to help predict space weather is to image the Sun and understand its activity, which NASA is doing with various missions like the Parker Solar Probe. But right now, it\u2019s still difficult to know how the atmosphere will respond to solar events. And that makes it hard to plan for storms and other weird space weather behavior. \u201cYou would be sort of surprised at how poorly you could sort of plan your days if you didn\u2019t know the weather tomorrow,\u201d says Immel, \u201cwhich is something of our situation with the ionosphere.\u201d\n\nTo better understand this enigmatic area of space, the ICON mission team is sending the satellite right into the thick of things. The vehicle is going to an altitude of about 360 miles, just above the peak of this atmospheric layer, which is about 120 to 200 miles high, according to Immel. ICON will also circulate Earth at a low latitude over the planet; that\u2019s where the ionosphere is densest. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on that region because that\u2019s where all the action is,\u201d says Immel.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on that region because that\u2019s where all the action is.\u201d\n\nICON is equipped with various instruments designed to get a more complete understanding of what the ionosphere is up to. The satellite will measure the temperature and winds of the particles and plasma within this region, and the vehicle will also measure the atmosphere\u2019s density as well as all of the chemicals that are present. It will even measure how the atmosphere glows, which indicates how the ionosphere is moving in space. All of these measurements could be used to make better models about how the ionosphere will act at any given time. \u201cWe are looking to be able to inform modelers and theorists about what needs to be measured to make better predictions for the ionosphere tomorrow,\u201d says Immel.\n\nWhile in space, ICON will work in tandem with another mission called GOLD, which launched in January 2018. GOLD is actually a NASA instrument attached to a commercial satellite that lives 22,000 miles above the Earth\u2019s surface. From this vantage point, GOLD has been collecting data on the ionosphere from above. Together, the two missions will provide very different information about the atmosphere from different locations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at space weather like what happens with hurricanes,\u201d Immel said during a pre-launch press conference. \u201cWhere the GOES [weather forecasting] satellites provide large-scale imaging, and we actually fly airplanes into the hurricanes to sample them and gain more information. And that\u2019s what ICON and GOLD are going to be able to combine to do for space weather.\u201d\n\nICON was supposed to be working in sync with GOLD much earlier, as it was originally set for launch in 2017 and then in 2018 from the Kwajalein Atoll. The first, the launch was delayed due to concerns that parts of the Pegasus rocket might not separate properly during the mission, while the second flight was postponed after some unexpected noise was detected in the rocket\u2019s controls. The launch was then moved to Cape Canaveral, Florida, and scheduled for October 2018, but the noise problems popped up again.\n\n\u201cwe wanted to get things right on this rocket.\u201d\n\nSince then, Northrop Grumman found several causes for the noise problem and switched up some of the electronics and hardware to correct the issue. \u201cI want to apologize for delaying you guys for the last 11 months,\u201d Omar Baez, the senior launch director for NASA\u2019s Launch Services Program at Kennedy Space Center, said during the pre-launch press conference. \u201cBut we wanted to get things right on this rocket.\u201d\n\nDuring the wait, the ICON team periodically checked on ICON to make sure it was still functioning as expected. The engineers took the vehicle out of storage, turned on all of the instruments, and made sure all of its basic functions were working as expected. \u201cWe feel super good about the prospects for a great mission,\u201d Immel said.\n\nThe ICON launch is currently scheduled for October 9th at 9:30PM ET out of Florida. The Pegasus rocket will \u201ctake off\u201d under the wing of its carrier aircraft, a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar called Stargazer, and move out over the Atlantic Ocean. Once the plane reaches the right altitude and drop zone, it\u2019ll release Pegasus, which will then ignite its main engine and zoom into orbit. This method is known as air launch, and it\u2019s a very rare way of getting into space. Only a handful of other companies plan to attempt this kind of technique \u2014 notably Virgin Galactic\u2019s spinoff company called Virgin Orbit.\n\nNASA\u2019s coverage for the ICON launch will get underway at 9:15PM ET. Weather doesn\u2019t look great for the mission as there\u2019s only a 30 percent chance that conditions will be favorable. If tonight\u2019s mission doesn\u2019t occur as planned, Northrop Grumman has a backup launch date on Thursday, October 10th. For now, the team is proceeding normally, so check back later to see if this extra-delayed mission finally makes it to space.", "description": "NASA is slated to launch a long-awaited satellite from Florida on October 9th that\u2019s designed to help scientists better predict how space weather events will behave high above Earth.
