The clip is the third instance of the Canadian prime minister wearing racist make-up to emerge in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe video was first obtained by Global News.\n\nIn the footage a young Mr Trudeau can be seen with his face covered in what appears to be dark make-up.\n\nHe is dressed in jeans and a t-shirt and proceeds to laugh and stick his tongue out at the camera.\n\nIt is unclear when and where the video was filmed.\n\nThe video was released just hours after Mr Trudeau apologised for wearing make-up to darken his skin at an Arabian Nights themed party in 2001.\n\nThe Canadian leader was 29-years-old at the time.\n\nIn a photograph from the party, first published by TIME Magazine, Mr Trudeau can be seen dressed in a white turban.\n\nThe prime minister, who launched his re-election campaign just a week ago, said he should have known better, when asked about the costume.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m p***** off at myself, I\u2019m disappointed in myself,\u201d he told reporters travelling with him on his campaign plane.\n\nA spokesperson for Mr Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party confirmed the validity of the photo to TIME Magazine on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt was a photo taken while he was teaching in Vancouver, at the school\u2019s annual dinner which had a costume theme of Arabian Nights\u201d, a spokesperson said.\n\nMr Trudeau admitted to a second incident while apologising for the first.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in high school I dressed up at a talent show and sang Day-O with make-up one,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are people who make mistakes in this life and you make decisions based on what they actually do, what they did and on a case-by-case basis. I deeply regret that I did that. I should have known better but I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\nThe 47-year-old is yet to comment on the video.\n\nThe controversy comes as a critical time for Mr Trudeau as he campaigns for re-election on 21 October, with polls saying he faces a serious challenge from Conservative leader Andrew Scheer.\n\nThe Canadian leader is already vulnerable following one of the biggest scandals in Canadian political history, which arose when his former attorney general said he improperly pressured her to halt the criminal prosecution of a company in Quebec.\n\nMr Trudeau has defended himself by claiming he was standing up for jobs.\n\nHe is admired around the world for his progressive policies in the Trump era, but the recent scandals have tarnished the prime minister\u2019s liberal credentials in the eyes of some critics.", "description": "A video of Justin Trudeau wearing blackface has been released.
