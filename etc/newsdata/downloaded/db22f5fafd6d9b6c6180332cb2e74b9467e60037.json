After adopting gun control as a marquee issue following the mass shooting in El Paso earlier this year, O\u2019Rourke promised a mandatory gun buyback program for assault weapons, memorably telling a moderator, \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d Not long after, Trump and Republicans blamed his comments for making it harder to get a gun control deal done in Congress. (Yes, that\u2019s a bit rich coming from the GOP, but I\u2019ll come back to that).\n\nThese are not the only far-left positions Beto has staked out recently. He\u2019s strongly pro reparations, for instance. But his comments about churches and guns are especially remarkable, in that he\u2019s essentially adopting unpopular stances that Democratic politicians have spent years claiming are unfair caricatures of their actual beliefs. He is turning himself into a walking straw man, the non-fringe guy Republicans can reliably point to when they want to say: \u201cSee, the libs really do want to take your guns and shut down your churches.\u201d\u2026\n\nNow, O\u2019Rourke has thrown kerosene on the issue all over again, and for what? For many religious institutions, this is a legitimately existential issue\u2014paying property taxes, business income taxes (assuming they do more than break even), and losing the ability to collect tax deductible donations would be a massive financial blow. For LGBTQ rights activists, it would perhaps be a moral victory, but one that would also risk triggering an explosive culture war over faith that could transform gay marriage back into a deeply polarizing topic when it\u2019s been trending in the other direction. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve seen no evidence that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s position has much support among a wide swath Democratic voters or leaders. Yet there is now video of a telegenic presidential candidate bringing form to religious conservatives\u2019 worst fears, like some sort of tax-policy Babadook.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jordan Weissmann", "Slate.Com News-And-Politics Beto-Orourke-Tax-Exemptions-Religious-Groups-Churches-Lgbtq.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
