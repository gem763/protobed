Selzer\u2019s surveys screen voters based on a single question: whether they will attend the caucuses. If they answer \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably,\u201d she counts them in her poll as likely voters and takes their candidate preferences into account. If they don\u2019t, she doesn\u2019t. Selzer doesn\u2019t consider prior voting history or make any other predictions about turnout. Rather, she operates under the premise that the past is not always prologue. \u201cI don\u2019t assume anything,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses this year, with all of their unknowns, could perhaps be the ultimate test of her method. The virtual caucuses were the Democratic Party\u2019s response to years of voter complaints that visiting precinct sites in person is too difficult\u2014especially for those with inflexible work or personal schedules\u2014and takes too long. Even before news of the DNC\u2019s worries first broke yesterday morning, party officials didn\u2019t know what to expect from the virtual event, and voters, according to Selzer\u2019s June poll, didn\u2019t know what to think about it either. The DNC\u2019s decision, and the state party\u2019s promise to somehow expand accessibility, adds yet more unpredictability.\n\nI spoke with Selzer twice this week, before and after the DNC\u2019s concerns were made public, about her process and why she anticipates unusually high turnout in February. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nElaine Godfrey: You\u2019ve described your polling method as \u201cpolling forward.\u201d What does that mean?\n\nJ. Ann Selzer: \u201cPolling forward\u201d is not just with caucuses, but with any polling that we do when it comes to trying to take a look at a future event. We do not create a likely-voter model. And we don\u2019t weight our data according to past election information. So we poll forward and let our data show us what is happening with the electorate\u2014what groups seem to be coming out in larger numbers or in lower numbers than before\u2014rather than enforce on the data some history of what has happened in the electorate before.\n\n[Weighting data according to past election information] may have been possible to do in the past, when the electorate was fairly stable from election to election. That is no longer the case in my observation of how elections change.\n\nGodfrey: Why is it no longer the case that the electorate is stable?\n\nSelzer: The biggest learning episode for me was in the 2008 caucuses. Our data showed us that on caucus night, on the Democratic side, more than half [of Iowans polled] were going to be attending their first caucus. There is no likely-voter model in the world that would ever predict that. And so there was a ruckus, sort of started by the Clinton campaign putting out a memo saying, \u201cLook, [Selzer has] made an outrageous assumption about who likely caucus-goers are. It\u2019s ridiculous; she\u2019ll be fired, blah blah blah.\u201d", "description": "J.
