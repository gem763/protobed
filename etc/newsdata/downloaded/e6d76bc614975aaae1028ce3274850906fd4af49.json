Jadeja returned figures of 3-52.\n\nThe win also consolidated India\u2019s number-one position in the world Test championship with 200 points.\n\nSkipper Virat Kohli set up the win with his unbeaten 254 \u2014 a record seventh double-century for the star batsman \u2014 in India\u2019s 601 for five declared.\n\nRavichandran Ashwin struck twice in the morning session after the tourists started their second innings trailing by 326.\n\nAshwin had du Plessis \u2014 who promoted himself to number four in the batting order \u2014 caught behind for five with wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha holding on to a juggling catch.\n\nThe off-spinner soon got opening batsman Dean Elgar caught for 48 as South Africa slipped further.\n\nPaceman Ishant Sharma struck with his second ball of the day to trap Aiden Markram lbw for nought.\n\nMarkram had a long discussion with Elgar over whether to review the on-field call but walked, only for the replays to suggest the ball would have gone over the stumps.\n\nThe Proteas were dismissed for 275 at the end of day three in response to India\u2019s 601-5 declared, 127 short of the follow-on.\n\nSouth Africa put up some resistance in their first innings with Maharaj, who made 72, and Philander, 44 not out, putting on 109 runs for the ninth wicket to frustrate the Indian bowlers.\n\nAshwin broke the stand with Maharaj\u2019s wicket and then got last man Rabada to return figures of 4-69.\n\nThe match will also be remembered for his Kohli\u2019s marathon knock as he surpassed Don Bradman\u2019s tally of 6,996 runs.\n\nKohli, who now has 7,054 runs from 81 Tests, put together crucial partnerships including a 225-run fifth-wicket stand with Jadeja, who made 91, to extend India\u2019s dominance.\n\nOpener Mayank Agarwal also contributed with a century.\n\nThe two teams now head to Ranchi for the final match starting October 19.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Umesh Yadav led an inspired bowling display as India thrashed South Africa by an innings and 137 runs\u00a0in the second Test to clinch a record 11th-straight series triumph at home on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jADDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
