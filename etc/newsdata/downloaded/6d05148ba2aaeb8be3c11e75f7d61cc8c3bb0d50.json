Reporters on the scene said that he expressed no remorse for killing his sister and accused her of dishonoring their family.\n\nIn a tweet posted days before her death, Baloch wrote, \"As women we must stand up for ourselves. As women we must stand up for each other. I believe I am a modern day feminist.\"\n\nBaloch's brother said her public image and outspoken views brought dishonor to his family and ultimately caused him to take her life.\n\nFollowing Baloch's murder, feminists in the capital, Islamabad, organized demonstrations to protest honor killings, whose perpetrators were allowed to go free if the victim's family forgave the killer.\n\nPakistan's parliament has since changed those laws and toughened penalties for honor killings after international backlash pressured lawmakers to make changes. While killers can still be spared the death penalty, there is now a mandatory 25-year prison sentence.\n\nHonor killings are not just limited to Pakistan. Cases have been reported in other parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia. The International Humanist and Ethical Union has noted that honor killings are rarely investigated and often go unpunished.\n\nPaolo Zialcita is an intern on NPR's News Desk.", "description": "Qandeel Baloch, seen as a feminist voice in conservative Pakistan, was murdered by her brother in 2016 in an apparent \"honor killing.\"", "authors": ["Paolo Zialcita"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/27/ap_16206413289839_wide-a29fa785b5fe95c31a862de47ebd8a0df0c83fa8.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
