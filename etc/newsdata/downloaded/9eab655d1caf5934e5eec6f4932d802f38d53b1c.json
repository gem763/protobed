President Trump added fuel to the fire when, in August, he retweeted an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that Epstein was somehow killed by Bill Clinton.\n\nEpstein died in August while in federal custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. He tied his jail bed sheet around his neck and used it to hang himself, breaking several bones in the process, officials said.\n\nBaden, a Fox News contributor, countered those findings on Wednesday. After observing the autopsy, he said \"I've not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case.\"\n\nHe said that due to issues at the jail \u2014 including two guards who were supposed to check on him but fell asleep, as well as a malfunctioning security camera \u2014 homicide could be a possibility. \"The investigation is not completed until all the information has come in,\" he added.\n\nIn an interview with the Miami Herald, Baden said that Epstein's brother doesn't think the cause of death is suicide and is concerned that others could be in jeopardy if it was a homicide.\n\nSampson told the New York Times that she stood by her ruling, and said her examination was comprehensive.\n\n\"I stand firmly behind our determination of the cause and manner of death in this case,\" she said. \"In general, fractures of the hyoid bone and the cartilage can be seen in suicides and homicides.\"\n\nAt the time of his death, Epstein was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges after being accused of abusing dozens of girls as young as 14 over a period of years dating back to the early 2000s. While criminal charges against Epstein were dropped due to his death, Attorney General William Barr has pledged that the Justice Department will pursue charges against his enablers.\n\nNOW WATCH: What street markets look like around the world", "description": "Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist, said that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's body displayed signs of homicide, rather than suicide.", "authors": ["Nicole Einbinder"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OzzDXCXzxvPWLoG6GBVYBA--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/fbfd4b7aff5adff3c18f166448e54414", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
