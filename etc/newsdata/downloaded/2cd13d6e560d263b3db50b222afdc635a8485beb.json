Photo: ABC\n\nPicking and choosing the best television programs on Hulu is a little different from cataloguing the top-shelf choices available on Amazon Prime or Netflix. Unlike those two companies, Hulu\u2019s main thrust has always been television. It started life as a way to watch last night\u2019s shows today, and that\u2019s still its purpose for a lot of people \u2014 meaning that its catalog is constantly being updated with new shows.\n\nSo in looking at the best programming for your free time, we tried to focus (with a few exceptions) on shows that have been on for at least a few seasons, and mostly shows that are off now the air. If a new program takes off, we\u2019ll add it, but we tried to stick with modern classics or long-running current shows, with a handful of Hulu Originals sprinkled in, and currently-running FX shows, as a lot of them are exclusive to the service. Anyway, it\u2019s time to get watching.\n\n11.22.63\n\nBefore Handmaids Tale, The Act, and Castle Rock, Hulu\u2019s biggest original production was this early 2016 mini-series based on the Stephen King book of the same name. James Franco plays a teacher in Maine (of course) who is presented with a chance to go back in time, and he chooses to try and stop the assassination of JFK. It\u2019s a little clunky at times, but has a great cast, including Franco, Sarah Gadon, and Chris Cooper.\n\n24\n\nOften forgotten when people discuss the most influential and important shows of the Peak-TV era, this massive FOX hit is still a wildly entertaining show, even if some of its politics now look even more problematic than they did in the \u201900s. If you can ignore some of the show\u2019s stereotypes and politics, Kiefer Sutherland has never been better than he is as the iconic Jack Bauer, one of the most beloved TV characters of the modern era. The best seasons of 24 are more entertaining than any action movie released in theaters this year.\n\n30 Rock\n\nTina Fey\u2019s razor-sharp look behind the scenes at a late-night comedy show looks even smarter over a decade after its premiere. Who hasn\u2019t wondered how this show would skewer changes in the world since it went off the air, from social media influencers to Donald Trump? Looking back on the entirety of one of the best network comedies of the modern age, we really miss Liz Lemon, Tracy Jordan, Jenna Maroney, and, yes, even Jack Donaghy.\n\nThe Act\n\nJoey King and Patricia Arquette were Emmy-nominated for their excellent work in this 8-part mini-series about one of the most sensational true crime stories of the modern era. King plays Gypsy Rose Blanchard, who murdered her mother Dee Dee, played unforgettably by Arquette, revealing a lifetime of abuse and fraud. This is dark, fascinating television \u2014 you won\u2019t be able to turn away.\n\nAdventure Time\n\nThere\u2019s a wealth of Cartoon Network programming on Hulu \u2014 it\u2019s one of the best streaming sources if you have kids \u2014 but this is arguably that cable channel\u2019s best program ever. Pendelton Ward\u2019s vision may first seem like just another parody of fantasy tropes, but it develops into something much deeper and smarter, even progressive in the way it captures diversity and individualism. It\u2019s consistently clever and surprising \u2014 two things most cartoons are not.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock Presents\n\nThere\u2019s a depressingly meager number of films from the Master of Suspense on any of the streaming services, but we can make up for it a bit with this great \u201860s anthology series from the director of Psycho, Rear Window, and dozens of other classic films. This one is a great time-suck: over 150 episodes of incredibly confident genre television.\n\nThe Amazing Race\n\nIn 2003, the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences recognized the popularity and quality of reality competition programming, instituting a new category to recognize the best of the best. Something remarkable happened \u2014 the same show won the first seven years. It was this CBS hit, a masterful example of how to edit competition shows into something thrilling, and a decent way to see the world without ever leaving your couch.\n\nAmerican Horror Story\n\nThe multiple seasons of FX\u2019s hit show have been a rollercoaster in terms of quality but just strap in and enjoy the ride. The latest outing (Apocalypse) isn\u2019t quite on here yet but should be before the newest iteration (1984) premieres in September. The other seven are all here. Start with Murder House, of course, which is still the best of the seven seasons, but almost all of them have interesting beats, especially the underrated 2017 outing Cult.\n\nAngel\n\nSpin-offs of critically acclaimed shows typically fail. You can use the old axiom that lightning doesn\u2019t strike twice, but it\u2019s truly difficult to get out of the shadow of a major hit. It feels like Angel never quite did escape the legacy of Buffy, which is a shame given how excellent this show became. David Boreanaz\u2019s first (of many) star vehicles ran from 1999-2004 and produced over 100 episodes.\n\nAngie Tribeca\n\nThere\u2019s nothing quite as goofy as this TBS comedy starring Rashida Jones, Hayes MacArthur, Jere Burns, and Deon Cole. The spoof of comedy shows is heavily reliant on physical humor in a way that\u2019s purposefully reminiscent of broad comedies like Sledge Hammer! and Police Squad! (which was developed into the Naked Gun movies). It\u2019s not exactly \u201chighbrow,\u201d but it actually takes really smart people to make comedy this entertainingly dumb.\n\nAnimaniacs\n\nThere\u2019s a whole generation excited by this entry. Running from 1993 to 1998, this Steven Spielberg production appealed to preteens after school more than it did little kids. It was a part of Saturday mornings on Fox for three years and then, even more memorably, a part of afternoons on the WB from 1995 to 1998. It\u2019s one of those cartoons with a little something for every generation. Watch it again now and you\u2019ll get all the jokes that went over your head in the \u201890s.\n\nA.P. Bio\n\nWe said in the intro that we were going to lean more heavily on catalog shows than current ones, but we\u2019re going to make an exception for this recent NBC comedy simply because it needs some love. Despite really coming together in season two, the Peacock Network canceled the low-rated comedy starring Glenn Howerton and Patton Oswalt just as it was finding its groove. And then they changed their mind! Thanks probably in part to fans finding it on Hulu, NBC announced they were going to bring it back for their upcoming streaming service. Watch the first two seasons here while you still can.\n\nArcher\n\nSpeaking of great cartoons, here\u2019s one that\u2019s definitely not for kids. Hulu is the best of the streaming services when it comes to FX programming \u2014 you\u2019ll find a few FX shows on this list \u2014 and this is one of the cable network\u2019s best shows in their esteemed history. Over its ten seasons and counting, Archer has redefined itself, starting as a straightforward, adults-only spoof of 007 and spy movies, but twisting over rebooted seasons that parody things like film noir and Miami Vice. As of this writing, nine seasons are available on Hulu, but the tenth-season space parody Archer: 1999 will likely join them soon.\n\nArrested Development\n\nHas the current quality of Arrested Development allowed you to forget that the first three seasons were pure genius? Don\u2019t let that happen. Go back and watch the early brilliance of the Bluth family saga, and on Hulu you won\u2019t have to worry about even being tempted to watch the revival, with previews for how far the show has fallen, like you would on Netflix.\n\nAsh vs. Evil Dead\n\nSince Ash rode off into the medieval sunset in 1989\u2019s Army of Darkness, there were several aborted attempts to bring the cynical killer of the undead back to the big screen, but he actually ended up on the small one, in this three-season wonder from Starz. Bruce Campbell, star of Evil Dead 2 and living legend, returns as Ash, as do the trademark practical effects and cheesy humor from the Sam Raimi films. It\u2019s a lot of fun.\n\nAtlanta\n\nThe only place you can watch one of the \u201910s best shows with a streaming subscription is Hulu. Over only two seasons, Donald Glover\u2019s creative vision of life as a young black man in America has been as critically acclaimed as anything on television for a reason. It is daring, brilliant, hysterical TV, the kind of thing that is difficult to capture in words. Just see what all the buzz is about for yourself.\n\nBetter Things\n\nAnother FX show! One of television\u2019s smartest comedies is this gem created by and starring Pamela Adlon. The brilliant comedian presents a skewed version of her own life balancing parenthood with working as an actress, and the result is as confessional, hysterical, and daring as any comedy of the modern era. This show still feels a bit under the radar of where it deserves to be (and the third season was ridiculously snubbed by the Emmys). Time will correct that. Be on the right side of history now.\n\nBeverly Hills 90210\n\nDon\u2019t roll your eyes at us. It\u2019s hard to overstate how much this show was more than just a time-filler on Fox in the \u201890s \u2014 it was a phenomenon. Running for the entire decade (seriously, October 1990 to May 2000), Aaron Spelling\u2019s teen soap opera wasn\u2019t just a hit, it was a franchise, spawning spin-offs like Melrose Place and Models Inc. The current reboot is kind of bombing, but there\u2019s a reason Fox thought the fan interest was still there. See why with the original.\n\nThe Bob Newhart Show\n\nIf there was a Mt. Rushmore of TV Comedy, it would have to include Bob Newhart, a man whose dry sense of humor redefined the form over three separate shows in three separate decades. He had a variety series in the \u201860s, but that was mere warm-up for this \u201870s classic that ran for 6 seasons and 142 episodes on CBS. So much of Newhart\u2019s deadpan wit would work its way into television comedy in the \u201880s and \u201890s that it still feels like he didn\u2019t get the credit he deserves.\n\nBob\u2019s Burgers\n\nEveryone still seems to talk about veterans The Simpsons and Family Guy, but neither has been the best FOX Sunday Night animated program in years. That title belongs to this gem, a family comedy in cartoon form that works for (mostly) all ages. After a rocky first season, Bob\u2019s Burgers developed into one of the smartest and sweetest shows on TV. At its best, it\u2019s close to peak Simpsons. And it\u2019s near its best right now. This is also one of the few shows on this list for which new episodes will be there the next day.\n\nBroad City\n\nAbbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer\u2019s Comedy Central hit just finished its 5-season run, so it\u2019s a good time to look back over what the show accomplished while it was on the air. Based on their real friendship and struggles in New York City, Broad City is an honest, daring piece of TV comedy that feels like something people will find on services like Hulu. We can\u2019t wait to see what Jacobson and Glazer do next.\n\nBrooklyn Nine-Nine\n\nWhat were you thinking, FOX? After this beloved comedy\u2019s cancellation, Jake Peralta and the 9-9 jumped over to NBC, where it now looks like they could air for years. This is another comedy that started off on shaky ground but became one of the best ensemble comedies after about a year or two. It\u2019s now as consistently funny as anything on network TV. Prediction: You know how everyone watches The Office over and over again on Netflix? This show will be like that in about a decade.\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer\n\nJoss Whedon\u2019s show is still dismissed by some people as a \u201cteen soap opera with fangs,\u201d but anyone who doesn\u2019t recognize how brilliant and important this show is to the history of television simply hasn\u2019t seen it. Buffy helped redefine audience expectations, proving that deep, progressive social commentary could be embedded in a show about monsters, and that people of all ages could get it. There is so many genre programs nowadays \u2014 from Stranger Things to Westworld \u2014 that owe a debt to this show.\n\nCastle Rock\n\nThe first season of Hulu\u2019s series inspired by the universe of Stephen King was a bit rocky, but ambitious enough for it to make this list, and not only for fans of one of the most successful writers of all time. Sure, if you\u2019re a King fan, this is a must-see, just for all of the Easter eggs, but it also has something for those who don\u2019t know their Pennywise from their Cujo, particularly in the ensemble, which includes great turns from Andre Holland, Melanie Lynskey, Scott Glenn, and, most of all, living legend Sissy Spacek.\n\nCasual\n\nOne of the first Hulu Original Series to get any sort of attention, the Jason Reitman-directed pilot of Casual premiered on the service in 2015, leading to a four-season run for the now-concluded dramady. The ups and downs of a divorce single mother and her odd family never quite gelled to become truly great television, but there\u2019s one major reason to watch this show: Michaela Watkins. The former SNL star does the best work of her career on this show.\n\nCatch-22\n\nThe limited series format has become one of the most creatively vital mediums of the modern era in any form. It\u2019s where movie stars and auteurs go to work through visions that the running time of the silver screen can\u2019t hold. Take this ambitious adaptation of the beloved 1961 novel. George Clooney directs Christopher Abbott, Kyle Chandler, Hugh Laurie, and many more in this six-episode look at the absurdity of war.\n\nCheers\n\nAny list of the best TV comedies of all time that doesn\u2019t include Cheers is just wrong. For most of the \u201980s, this was quite simply the best show on TV, and it\u2019s held up incredibly well over the years. It\u2019s still laugh-out-loud hysterical, anchored by one of the best ensembles in comedy TV history and razor-sharp writing. There\u2019s a reason this show won 28 Emmys.\n\nCommunity\n\nWe got six seasons, now where\u2019s our movie!? Fans of this NBC hit will get that reference, and those who don\u2019t should check out this Dan Harmon-created laugher that struggled due to low ratings but stayed afloat and on the air due to its incredibly loyal fan base. Much smarter than critics ever gave it credit for being, this was a show that matched NBC darlings like 30 Rock and Parks and Recreation at its creative peak. The entire run is definitely rocky, but you should watch it all \u2026 so you\u2019re ready for the movie!\n\nDead Like Me\n\nBryan Fuller\u2019s 2003-04 Showtime dramedy now feels way ahead of its time. Back then, shows that blended genre like this weren\u2019t as common, so people didn\u2019t know what to do with a program about grim reapers, played by Ellen Muth and Mandy Patinkin. Quirky and strange, Dead Like Me never quite took off enough to warrant even a third season, but the cult following around it continues to grow for a reason.\n\nThe Dick Van Dyke Show\n\nThere was TV before 2001? You\u2019d never know it given how much of the selection on streaming services is dedicated to modern TV hits. Consider this a history lesson in the form of a television comedy. It\u2019s only one of the most essential shows in terms of how the medium was shaped, and it\u2019s still remarkably funny, thanks in no small part to the absolutely perfect comic timing of Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore. They\u2019re legends for a reason.\n\nDrunk History\n\nIt\u2019s all there in the title of Derek Waters\u2019 historical and hysterical show. Comedians get drunk and try to recount important chapters from history, which are then re-enacted with famous celebrities in guest roles every week. You thought history class was boring? Try watching it this way.\n\nFamily Guy\n\nMore of an industry than just a show, Family Guy has joined the rarefied air of the most influential animated shows for adults like The Simpsons and South Park. It\u2019s not anywhere near its creative peak now, but you can dig into Hulu to see when the Griffin family felt truly subversive and consistently hysterical.\n\nFargo\n\nAll three seasons (so far \u2014 year four is currently in production for a 2020 bow) are available on Hulu, and there\u2019s really no logical reason not to watch this show as soon as possible if you have yet to see it. Noah Hawley\u2019s critical darling is simply brilliant, starting with a wonderfully entertaining first season anchored by Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman, and then developing into an arguably-better second season. Year three may not live up to the first two but remains must-see TV. Just trust us on this one. Watch them all.\n\nFirefly\n\nThe top of almost every list of \u201cshows canceled too soon,\u201d Joss Whedon\u2019s FOX sci-fi show had a brief run that almost seems to have cemented its legacy. Would we still be talking about it so much if it had been on for years? The fact that FOX couldn\u2019t see what they had in Firefly actually had a greater impact \u2014 illustrating how creatively na\u00efve the networks were at a time when companies like HBO were stealing talent away. See for yourself how big a mistake they made.\n\nFosse/Verdon\n\nIt seems likely that Netflix\u2019s When They See Us is going to sweep the Emmy categories this year, but don\u2019t count out this FX limited series, which finds Michelle Williams giving one of the most powerful performances of her career. She plays Gwen Verdon, collaborator and partner to the notoriously difficulty Bob Fosse, played unforgettably by Sam Rockwell. This is brilliant, dense television, one of the best limited series of not just 2019 but the entire decade. And it\u2019s already on Hulu.\n\nFrasier\n\nWhat\u2019s better: Cheers or Frasier? And is this the best spinoff ever? Why don\u2019t you watch the massive NBC hit that won so many Emmys that they practically had to disqualify it to let other people get a chance and get back to us? In all seriousness, the saga of Frasier Crane and his put-upon brother Niles has held up marvelously. Frasier\u2019s regularly defeated pomposity will never not be funny.\n\nFuturama\n\nFry, Bender, and Co. always seemed to live in the shadow of Matt Groening\u2019s other little Fox hit, especially when this animated sci-fi comedy didn\u2019t find an audience as quickly as the network wanted. However, there\u2019s something ironic about how a show that features cryogenically preserved life has kind of refused to die, coming back in TV films and even a revival on Comedy Central. It\u2019s a testament to the diehard fans. Don\u2019t be surprised if it comes back for another reboot.\n\nFuture Man\n\nSeth Rogen and Evan Goldberg produce this Hulu Original, a raunchy and crazy sci-fi comedy that stars Josh Hutcherson as an average schlub who ends up being the savior of the human race when he masters a video game designed to find such a hero (echoes of The Last Starfighter almost certainly intentional). Eliza Coupe and Derek Wilson co-star in a show that\u2019s inconsistent but also undeniably unpredictable. A third and final season should air next year.\n\nThe Goldbergs\n\nFamily sitcoms almost never get the credit they deserve in our current era of \u201chighbrow\u201d comedy, but this has been one of the most consistent on network TV for the better part of the \u201810s thanks in large part to an underrated ensemble and a big heart. A very self-aware blend of \u201880s nostalgia with standard family sitcom tropes, The Goldbergs is sweet and clever in ways that people who have given up on network TV may not expect. It\u2019s a hard show to hate.\n\nGolden Girls\n\nThank you for being a frieennnnd. Not only does this comedy classic have perhaps the best theme song of all time but it\u2019s held up remarkably well in the couple decades since it was one of the biggest shows on TV. The main reason for that is the ensemble \u2014 a quartet of mega-talented comediennes: Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, Estelle Getty, and the eternally beloved Betty White. They were funny then; they\u2019ll be funny always.\n\nThe Good Place\n\nThe best comedy currently on network TV is this existential laugher about a woman who dies and goes to the titular location, but not everything is exactly as it seems. This is a show that works better in binge format than it does week to week, as it\u2019s incredibly difficult to watch just one and it\u2019s really structured like one long film with the end of one episode often opening on the same scene in the next. The less you know about this great show\u2019s twists and turns, the better. Just trust us.\n\nThe Good Wife\n\nThis CBS drama never got strong ratings but brought a sheen of esteem and awards to the network that they probably wish they still had today. Julianna Margulies is excellent as Alicia Florrick, a woman who has to dig herself out of the rubble left by her husband\u2019s very public sex scandal. For the better part of the \u201810s, this was easily one of the smartest shows on network TV, and also had one of the best ensembles. When you\u2019re done with this, check out the spin-off The Good Fight on CBS All Access. It might even be better.\n\nGravity Falls\n\nMost animated programming aimed at kids goes on for years and years. It feels like there has to be at least 4,000 episodes of Spongebob Squarepants by now. But this Disney hit is a rare exception, running for only two phenomenal seasons, and leaving viewers wanting more. The result is a tight series run that really doesn\u2019t have a single bad episode in it. The story of two kids whose uncle runs one of those tourist-trap mystery shops \u2014 only this one contains some actual mysteries \u2014 works for all ages.\n\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\n\nHulu has lagged behind Amazon and Netflix in the originals department with one huge exception, the Emmy-winning drama based on the Margaret Atwood novel about a dystopian future that feels increasingly and disturbingly like life in 2019. The show has struggled some since its universally-acclaimed first year, but the performances continue to make it worth everyone\u2019s time, especially the leading one from Elisabeth Moss, one of the best actresses of her generation.\n\nHappy Endings\n\nA lot of Hulu\u2019s best shows are ones that struggled with Nielsen even as they were developing a loyal fan base like Community, Firefly, and this ABC comedy that never got the ratings but still gets buzz on social media. Why do people still hope for a reboot? Because Happy Endings was the rare smart relationship comedy on network TV, one that treated its characters seriously while also being charmingly goofy. It also had a perfect ensemble. All of you people who watch Friends repeats till you know them by heart? Try this one out.\n\nHill Street Blues\n\nPeople who think that quality TV didn\u2019t exist before Tony Soprano don\u2019t give enough credit to the network dramas of the \u201880s that really paved the way for HBO, AMC, FX, and the rest of the pioneers of the current age. One of the most important shows in history is this Steven Bochco drama that dominated ratings and awards shows for most of the \u201880s. One of network TV\u2019s first true ensemble dramas, Hill Street Blues follows the staff of a police station through their professional and personal lives, using a structure you can still see in dozens of shows today.\n\nHomeland\n\nThe series run of Showtime\u2019s Emmy winner has been a rollercoaster, even for its most diehard fans. Only the first five seasons of the show are now available on Hulu as of this writing \u2014 two more have aired on the cable network \u2014 and that run of the series features incredible highs and incredible lows. The first season remains the best, a showcase for the talents of Claire Danes, Damian Lewis, and Mandy Patinkin. You\u2019ll want to keep watching from there and some of your loyalty will be rewarded, but don\u2019t say you haven\u2019t been warned.\n\nHow I Met Your Mother\n\nAn entire generation of young people right this second is watching seasons of The Office and Friends for the 12th time. They\u2019re two of the biggest shows, years after their cancellation. It feels like something similar could happen to How I Met Your Mother, a CBS hit that went through a roller coaster in terms of quality over its 200-plus episodes (and ended horribly) but contains plenty of highlights and episodes people will want to watch again and again.\n\nIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\n\nFX\u2019s longest-running show also has one of the network\u2019s most devoted fan bases. The dark comedy about a bunch of misanthropic lunatics in a Philadelphia bar has been surprisingly consistent over its remarkable run \u2014 season 14 starts this September! If you like shows about selfish people behaving very badly, take a look at this, and marvel at how often this program has pushed the envelope in terms of taste and somehow survived changes in TV comedy to remain as popular as ever.\n\nKey & Peele\n\nNow that Jordan Peele is an Oscar-winning writer-director, it\u2019s even more interesting to look back at the development of his voice over three seasons on this Comedy Central smash hit. Matched by his best buddy Keegan-Michael Key, Peele pair created some of the smartest sketch comedy of the \u201910s, and they had the nerve to go out on top after only 53 episodes over five seasons. Watch them all. Then watch them again.\n\nThe Killing\n\nAMC\u2019s huge hit mystery series became a controversial chapter in TV history when its first season didn\u2019t end with a resolution to its central murder mystery. Fans were furious, and the outrage likely inspired the limited series approach we now see way more often. A network or streaming company wouldn\u2019t dare leave a murder unsolved from season to season now. The controversy overshadowed a show that had decent episodes after that first season too, although would never quite live up to year one\u2019s captivating examination of the ripple effect of unspeakable crime.\n\nKilling Eve\n\nRight now, only the first season of BBC America\u2019s hit show is on Hulu, although it\u2019s likely to be joined soon by the Emmy-nominated sophomore year. Watch whatever you can while you can or you\u2019ll be behind when people talk about one of the most-buzzed shows in years, a whip-smart hybrid of thriller and character study with two phenomenal performances from Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer.\n\nKing of the Hill\n\nMike Judge and Greg Daniels\u2019 Fox hit ran for 13 years, producing over 250 episodes, but it feels like too few people still talk about it almost a decade after Hank, Peggy, and Bobby Hill rode across the Texan horizon. It\u2019s time for a reappraisal of a show that was consistently funny and sweet. Some of the progressive elements of this show and the way it challenged Hank Hill\u2019s old-fashioned, conservative beliefs feel downright ahead of their time now.\n\nThe Last Man on Earth\n\nOn the one hand, it\u2019s amazing that something as delightfully strange as this sci-fi comedy ran for four seasons on network TV. On the other hand, we\u2019re still angry that Fox canceled the show after a cliffhanger, denying Tandy and his friends the narrative closure this show really deserved. Here\u2019s what we need \u2014 everybody watch this on Hulu. If it\u2019s their No. 1 streaming show, maybe they\u2019ll get the gang together for a Deadwood-style closure movie.\n\nThe League\n\nFor seven seasons, the cast of this FX hit comedy captured the alpha male stupidity that\u2019s often amplified through fantasy football. With guest appearances by actual NFL players and increasingly ludicrous plot lines \u2014 some of them very adult \u2014 this was a great showcase for incredibly talented comedians, including Mark Duplass, Nick Kroll, Paul Scheer, Katie Aselton, and the always-amazing Jason Mantzoukas as Rafi, perhaps the dirtiest comedy supporting character of the last decade.\n\nLegion\n\nWith the possible exception of Twin Peaks: The Return, there\u2019s no more WTF show of the modern era of Peak TV than this very loose adaptation of the Marvel series starring Dan Stevens. This is a show that\u2019s nearly impossible to describe to people who haven\u2019t seen it, which is one of the reasons it\u2019s great. It\u2019s an absolute mindfuck of a program that just got weirder in each of its three seasons. Check it out and try and explain it all to us.\n\nLetterkenny\n\nWho wants a little Canadian humor? What if we told you that this quirky comedy was one of the biggest hits from our neighbor, a show that recently won an award for Best Canadian Comedy series and earned a commitment for dozens more episodes? Starting life as a web series and now branded as a Hulu Original in the U.S., Jared Keeso and Jacob Tierney\u2019s comedy about life in a very small town is charmingly stupid, not unlike King of the Hill or Beavis & Butt-head relocated to the land of hockey and Mounties. Don\u2019t get it wrong \u2014 it takes smart, talented people to make something this dumb this entertaining.\n\nLodge 49\n\nAMC has struggled to find an acclaimed, hit drama with the decline of The Walking Dead, but people seem to be taking to this laid-back, fascinating dramedy starring the great Wyatt Russell. The second season is currently airing, and AMC dropped the first on Hulu to give people a chance to catch up. The story of an ex-surfer named Dud who finds community with a fraternal order in Long Beach feels like it\u2019s just on the cusp of being your friend\u2019s favorite show. Watch it before that happens.\n\nThe Looming Tower\n\nThis high-budget, star-powered adaptation of Lawrence Wright\u2019s novel feel like it would have gotten a great deal more attention if it was on something like HBO or even Netflix. It tells the story of counter-terrorism in the \u201890s and the people who watched the rise of Osama Bin Laden to that fateful day in 2001. It\u2019s a smart show, anchored by a talented ensemble led by Jeff Daniels, Tahar Rahim, Bill Camp, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Peter Sarsgaard.\n\nLost\n\nABC\u2019s last great drama premiered in 2004 and became an overnight sensation. The road over the next six seasons would be rocky, although history is starting to come around to remember the peaks of this brilliant show more than its valleys. If you haven\u2019t seen it, we\u2019re jealous of what you\u2019re about to experience. Just watch the pilot, still one of the best ever made, and try not being hooked immediately.\n\nM*A*S*H\n\nThis adaptation of the 1970 Robert Altman film, itself an adaptation of a 1968 novel by Richard Hooker, was the biggest show of its era, and one of the biggest of all time. There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s basically played in repeats since the day it went off the air, with the biggest series finale of all time, a ratings number that will never be topped. 125 million people watched it with a 77 share. That\u2019s physically impossible now. See the show that made history.\n\nMalcolm in the Middle\n\nThis Fox hit doesn\u2019t get enough credit for helping to lead the sitcom from the laugh-track, studio-audience era to the current single-camera comedy format that everyone knows and loves. When it premiered in 2000, it was unusual to see a comedy on network TV that looked like a short film, and the first few seasons of this family sitcom were clever and heartfelt. It kind of fell apart, but Bryan Cranston and Jane Kaczmarek make even the late seasons worth a look.\n\nNYPD Blue\n\nDoes anyone else miss the days when network TV produced dramas as reliably well-written and performed as this Stephen Bochco hit? Sure, the 12 seasons of this ABC cop drama fluctuated wildly in terms of quality, but when NYPD Blue was good, it was among the best shows on television. And it rarely gets the credit it deserves for reshaping the form in terms of what was allowed for adult audiences. TV wouldn\u2019t be the same today without it.\n\nThe Office\n\nDon\u2019t get too excited. Only the U.K. version is available here, so you won\u2019t be able to subscribe to Hulu for Michael Scott once Netflix\u2019s No. 1 show jumps ship. Still, the Ricky Gervais original is a comedy classic, a masterful study of extremely awkward behavior that built the foundation for the NBC show you know and love so well.\n\nThe Outer Limits\n\nThis ABC anthology series that started in the \u201860s (and had reboots in the \u201890s and \u201800s) will always be in the shadow of The Twilight Zone, a show that clearly influenced it into existence, but it\u2019s worth a look in its own right. This one is more sci-fi-heavy than Serling\u2019s show, but it does often contain fun, last-minute twists. Plus: There are rumors it is being rebooted yet again. We\u2019ll see.\n\nParks and Recreation\n\nIf The Office has a challenger in the department of best modern network workplace comedies, it\u2019s this brilliant program, a show that took a few seasons to really find its groove but then never looked back. By season three, when Rob Lowe & Adam Scott are on the show and the writers have learned how to write for their amazing ensemble, this was one of the funniest shows on TV. We still miss it.\n\nParty Down\n\nOne of the cult hits of the modern era of TV, it feels like way more people have watched this Starz comedy in the decade since it went off the air than ever paid attention to it when it was on. Adam Scott leads a great ensemble as an actor forced to work a crab job at a catering company. Scott stars alongside Ken Marino, Jane Lynch, Martin Starr, Lizzy Caplan, Jennifer Coolidge, Megan Mullaly, and many more. Yes, these are all very funny people.\n\nThe Path\n\nAaron Paul, Michelle Monaghan, and Hugh Dancy star in this complex Hulu Original drama about life in a cult. The sad news is that it was canceled after three seasons, but there\u2019s enough dramatic meat on the bones of those three years to warrant a look, especially in the performances from the talented leads. It never quite lived up to its potential but still reminds one how great Paul and Dancy can be.\n\nPreacher\n\nFor years, it felt like Garth Ennis\u2019 critical and cult darling comic book wasn\u2019t really adaptable for film and television, but Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, of all people, figured out how to make it work. Dominic Cooper, Joseph Gilgun, and Ruth Negga star in the AMC series, which is currently working its way through its fourth and final season. That means you might be able to watch the whole thing by the time you read this.\n\nRamy\n\nHulu made some progress in the original comedy department in early 2019, premiering acclaimed shows like PEN15, Shrill, and this program, their best original comedy to date. Ramy Yousseff creates and stars in a quasi-biographical story of what it\u2019s like to grow up Muslim in New York in the \u201910s. It\u2019s like Atlanta and Master of None in the way it blends issues of race into universal stories about being young in America. Don\u2019t miss this one.\n\nRegular Show\n\nJ.G. Quintel\u2019s Cartoon Network hit is one of those great animated shows that straddles the line between being something for kids and something attuned more to adult tastes. It\u2019s the story of two working-class buddies that just happen to be a blue jay and a raccoon. Often gloriously surreal, Regular Show ran for over 250 episodes for a reason. It\u2019s quirky in ways that modern animation isn\u2019t often allowed to be.\n\nRick and Morty\n\nIs there any group of people out there more loyal than Rick and Morty fans? In the span of just three seasons, Dan Harmon\u2019s brilliant animated sci-fi comedy has developed into the kind of phenomenon that people obsess over. And the news that there will be many more adventures (the network has committed to 70 more) of poor Morty and his mad scientist uncle Rick means that the cult that adores this show is likely to grow. Watch out.\n\nSaturday Night Live\n\nHulu is better at keeping up with current shows than it is providing deep catalogs for hits, but the Hulu page for one of the most important programs of all time offers a nice mix of both. Sure, they have the recent seasons in their entirety, spanning the last 15 years, but you can also jump in the time machine and see where TV comedy changed forever with the first five seasons.\n\nScrubs\n\nLife at Sacred Heart Hospital was part of the comedy scene for pretty much the entirety of the \u201900s. Bill Lawrence\u2019s beloved show lasted nine seasons and survived a jump to another network and a cast reboot. Launching the career of Zach Braff, Scrubs contained some of the decade\u2019s best ensemble comedy when it was at its peak. All of you people crying over losing The Office on Netflix? Give this one a try. It\u2019s shockingly rewatchable and still more often funny than it\u2019s not.\n\nSeinfeld\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve heard of it? You can\u2019t watch arguably the best sitcom of all time on Netflix or Amazon. The only streaming service that includes Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s masterpiece with its subscription cost is Hulu. You would think they would put that on their commercials. It would probably boost subscribers given how much people still absolutely adore this show.\n\nSesame Street\n\nNo, you can\u2019t exactly relive your childhood through Hulu as only the last six seasons of this PBS staple are available on the streaming service, but that\u2019s still a lot of time with Elmo, Oscar, Big Bird, and the gang. And any parent will tell you that streaming children\u2019s entertainment is a gift when you need to soothe an angry child. Sesame Street isn\u2019t your typical braindead kids\u2019 show, either \u2014 it\u2019s a smart, educational, progressive thing to show your kids. Heck, some adults could stand to relearn some of its lessons, too.\n\nThe Shield\n\nThe only place you can watch one of the best cop shows of all time is Hulu. Shawn Ryan\u2019s FX drama helped shape the modern TV landscape with its no-holds-barred presentation of cops who operate in a very gray area of morality. Michael Chiklis and Walton Goggins really drive the show, but the entire ensemble works, especially later season-long guest stars like Glenn Close and Forest Whitaker. This is a must-see.\n\nThe Simpsons\n\nOnly the most recent season of this FOX hit is available on Hulu, and probably not for long given that the show is reportedly going to jump ship from streaming services to yet another network-specific offering, but this is all the streaming Simpsons you\u2019ll find right now, so take what you can get. Is The Simpsons as good as it was in its prime? Is anything? There\u2019s still an episode every now and then worth watching, even if just to remind us of how this was once the best show on television.\n\nSons of Anarchy\n\nKurt Sutter\u2019s macho reimagining of Hamlet in the world of a California motorcycle gang often gets a bad rap as nothing more than macho posturing. This is a much smarter, more daring show than you might think at first, and it\u2019s anchored by stand-out performances from Ron Perlman and Katey Sagal, who was robbed of at least one Emmy nomination for her work here. This is another long-running drama with some rocky, sub-par seasons, but the entire trip is worth the ride overall.\n\nSouth Park\n\nHulu has a habit of including only a few seasons for some of their shows, but that\u2019s not the case with this breakthrough animated series \u2014 you can watch 22 seasons and counting. For over two decades, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny have been pushing boundaries and making headlines with their raunchy, progressive brand of humor. When it\u2019s great, South Park is still one of the funniest shows on TV.\n\nSouthland\n\nJohn Wells, the producer of ER and The West Wing, took a genuine creative risks with this ensemble cop drama, one of the most underrated shows of the Peak-TV era. For five seasons, TNT\u2019s best show brought us into the lives of its officers in ways that other cop dramas weren\u2019t willing to do. And the show featured an incredible ensemble, especially now-Oscar-winner Regina King. If you\u2019ve loved her award-winning work on American Crime and Seven Seconds, just wait till you see her here. She should have won at least one Emmy.\n\nSpaced\n\nLong before Star Trek and even Shaun of the Dead, the great Simon Pegg headlined this British comedy that ran for two seasons from 1999-2001. Co-starring his buddy Nick Frost, Spaced features Pegg as Tim Bisley, an average guy who ends up living with a woman he just met, played by Jessica Stevenson. Oh, we almost forgot, it was directed by Edgar Wright, the man who would go on to make movie classics with Pegg & Frost, not to mention a little movie called Baby Driver.\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nThis one is on the Mt. Rushmore of ensemble dramas. With programs like Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere, the adult network TV drama was redefined from a story-of-the-week format to something richer and more character-driven. All six seasons of this massive \u201980s hit were nominated for the Emmy for Best Drama, and the show launched careers, including David Morse, Howie Mandel, and a young actor named Denzel Washington.\n\nStar Trek\n\nDon\u2019t start yelling at us \u2014 we\u2019re not dumb enough to pick a favorite and so are just bundling all the current Star Trek offerings on Netflix into this one entry. The truth is you could spend days watching just Star Trek episodes on Hulu. They have the original series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise. Why not watch \u2019em all and pick your favorite? We\u2019re too scared.\n\nSuperstore\n\nOne of the smartest comedies on TV doesn\u2019t get nearly the critical attention it deserves but that\u2019s starting to change as it goes into its fifth season. Every year of this ensemble comedy has been stronger than the one before. It starts off a little shaky but check out this spiritual child of The Office that relocates that show\u2019s ensemble brand from a paper company to a big box store. As you get to know the characters, it only gets funnier and funnier.\n\nSurvivor\n\nThe undisputed king of the reality series is there on Hulu in its entirety. Yep, you can relive all the buzzworthy moments over the stunning 30-plus seasons of this show. There have been some stinkers, but Survivor remains a strong performer for CBS for a reason. It still has the most addictive structure to its game, demanding both social and physical acumen, and it has the best host in the history of reality TV in Jeff Probst. As they continue to play with the format and the rules, it feels Survivor could outlive us all.\n\nThe Terror\n\nThe catalog of limited series gems isn\u2019t as deep on Hulu as some of the competition, but they do have exclusive rights to this AMC horror hit from 2018, soon to return in a very different format \u2014 it appears that the show will follow an American Horror Story structure with a different story every season. The first one is based on the hit novel by Dan Simmons and stars the great Ciaran Hinds and Jared Harris in a semi-fictional story of a lost expedition in the middle of the 19th century. It\u2019s creepy and unforgettable.\n\nThe Thick of It\n\nBefore Veep, Armando Iannucci created this brilliant British political comedy starring peter Capaldi, and featuring the same razor-sharp, vicious wit that would define the HBO Emmy winner too. Like Veep, it pulls back the curtain on the selfish egos that control modern politics. It was such a critical darling that it was adapted into a feature film that ended up getting an Oscar nomination, In the Loop.\n\nTop Chef\n\nBravo\u2019s darling reality show has been running strong for 16 seasons now, and shows now signs of slowing down. One of the few reality competition shows to actually produce stars within its own industry with its winners, Top Chef values quality over the clich\u00e9s of the reality genre. And it helps that the show has two of the best hosts in the history of reality TV, Tom Colicchio and Padma Lakshmi.\n\nTop of the Lake\n\nOscar nominee Jane Campion wrote and directed both seasons of this critically acclaimed mystery series, both starring the great Elisabeth Moss. The Handmaids Tale star plays Detective Robin Griffin, investigating different mysteries in both seasons to date, both involving the fates of young girls. Holly Hunter guest stars in season one; Nicole Kidman and Gwendoline Christie in season two. The first is superior, but both are worth your time for the performances alone.\n\nThe Twilight Zone\n\nOne of the best shows of all time is about to be rebooted again, this time by the one and only Jordan Peele. Why not catch up with Rod Serling\u2019s wildly influential and brilliant creation, a show that still works brilliantly more than a half-century after it first aired, before you return to The Twilight Zone? This is the kind of TV that will never truly grow old, visions that tap into our greatest fears, anxieties, and needs. It was a masterpiece then and it\u2019s a masterpiece now.\n\nTwin Peaks\n\nThose of us old enough to remember when the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer dominated the cultural conversation will never forget it. There had never been anything like Twin Peaks on television and there wouldn\u2019t really be anything like it again until David Lynch returned to this world 25 years later. Sadly, the Showtime reboot isn\u2019t on here yet, but catch up with the original and mark the days until it is.\n\nThe Venture Bros.\n\nA spoof of the adventure and sci-fi serials that were more prevalent in animation in the \u201860s, this Adult Swim hit is often flat-out brilliant. It\u2019s one of the weirdest shows of the modern era, telling the story of the Venture family, who are often battling a supervillain named the Monarch. If you like Archer, give this a shot \u2014 it has a similar tone in the way it mimics and mocks tropes from genre films and shows that went out of fashion decades ago.\n\nVeronica Mars\n\nIt\u2019s the show that wouldn\u2019t stop! When this critically acclaimed teen mystery series premiered in 2004, who would have possibly guessed that not only would we have seen a feature film based on it but that it would be rebooted for a fourth season in 2019? The new year, a Hulu Original, has gotten some of the best reviews in the history of the Kristen Bell series. See what all the hype is about. (Note: As of this writing, you can only watch the movie if you have the HBO add-on package.)\n\nThe Walking Dead\n\nThe Walking Dead helped redefine appointment television just when ratings were starting to erode to streaming services and DVRs. They became a massive hit because everyone had to watch it on Sunday night, largely so they wouldn\u2019t hear spoilers about a major character death. It doesn\u2019t quite have the fan base it once did, but it\u2019s still lumbering along on AMC and likely will be around in some form for many years to come. Eight seasons are on Hulu as of this writing.\n\nWhat We Do in the Shadows\n\nJemaine Clement adapted his beloved comedy movie into a series in 2019, and the result was a big enough hit to get it renewed for another year. The show doesn\u2019t feature the same cast but does work from the same premise, which could be pitched as \u201cThe Real World but with vampires.\u201d It\u2019s very smart and very funny.\n\nThe Wonder Years\n\nIt\u2019s funny that a show that\u2019s basically about nostalgia for youth has now become an item of nostalgia for a generation raised on Kevin Arnold and his family. The ABC fan favorite stars Fred Savage as kid growing up in the \u201860s and features a level of heartfelt storytelling that wasn\u2019t often seen in shows of its era. It was a show that never went for an easy laugh, blurring the line between comedy and drama in ways that other shows never tried in 1988. That\u2019s why it\u2019s held up 30 years later.\n\nWorkaholics\n\nSometimes you want to watch a serious character drama or progressive comedy. Sometimes you want to watch a trio of idiots act like idiots. Workaholics is incredibly rewatchable, thanks mostly to the great comic timing by Blake Anderson, Adam DeVine, and Anders Holm.\n\nThe X-Files\n\nChris Carter\u2019s show truly changed the way people looked at genre television in the \u201890s, paving the way for the next two decades of hit sci-fi and supernatural programming. At its peak, it was one of the best shows on TV, and those episodes have held up as well as anything from the era. Pick out your faves and don\u2019t be surprised if you get sucked back into the entire saga of Mulder, Scully, Skinner, and the Cigarette Smoking Man.\n\nYou\u2019re the Worst\n\nStephen Falk\u2019s FX comedy stars Chris Geere and Aya Cash as a couple who defiantly refuse to be a couple. Smarter about relationships in the age of sexting and Tinder than nearly any other modern show, this hit just wrapped its run after five successful seasons. Watch the first four on Hulu now and keep your eyes open for year five to drop, because they really wrapped it up in style.", "description": "Hulu has plenty of free TV shows on its streaming service.
