When the people say about the Champions League being the target, we are still not ready,\u201d said Guardiola, whose side have won their opening two Champions League games and host Atalanta at the Etihad on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIn this competition you have to be strong in the boxes and this season we are not incredibly strong in the boxes. Of course we have time.\u201d\n\nCity have been beset by injuries in defence and suffered shock defeats to Norwich and Wolves in their opening nine Premier League games.\n\nGuardiola, though, believes the onus is on his side to attack well as a unit to mask any defensive failings.\n\n\u201cWhen you play good, you defend less. When our build-up is bad, when you don\u2019t play good, you concede a lot,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhat happens when we make our incredible, fluid game from the build-up? We concede few (chances). When our build-up is wrong, we make mistakes in the first pass, we are nervous like what happened against Wolves\u2026we concede a lot.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s related. It\u2019s not that you play well in one department and it\u2019s enough. When our pressing is high, is intense, we concede really few (chances).\u201d\n\nGuardiola will at least have more defenders to choose from for the visit of the Italians in midweek with Nicolas Otamendi and Kyle Walker returning to training after missing Saturday\u2019s 2-0 win at Crystal Palace, while John Stones could make his first start in five weeks.", "description": "Manchester (United Kingdom) (AFP) \u2013 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola believes the English champions are still not strong enough at either end", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/13750a_not-good-pep-guardiola-believes-manchester-city-are-not-yet-win-champions-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
