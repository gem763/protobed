Andrew Cuomo announced on Sunday.\n\nThe governor directed health Commissioner Howard Zucker to hold an emergency meeting with the Public Health and Health Planning Council this week to implement the ban. He also ordered the State Police and Department of Health to ramp up combined enforcement efforts against retailers who sell the devices to underage youths, including possible criminal penalties, as early as Oct. 4.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCuomo also said he will advance legislation to ban deceptive marketing of e-cigarettes to children and teens.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re selling flavors like bubble gum, cotton candy, Cap'n Crunch,\u201d he said at a morning news conference. \u201cYou're marketing to young people, and it\u2019s nicotine.\u201d\n\nThe governor added: \u201cI am a former cigarette smoker. It is highly addictive and highly difficult to stop, and to stay away from cigarettes for the rest of your life. It is a real struggle. The addiction to nicotine is powerful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a parallel to cigarettes,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here.\u201d\n\nAustin Finan, a spokesperson for Juul, a high-profile manufacturer of e-cigarettes, said the company would \"review\" Cuomo's announcement. Finan said the company agrees \"with the need for aggressive category-wide action on flavored products. That is why we already stopped selling our non-tobacco/non-menthol based JUULpods to traditional retail stores, are fighting against counterfeit and compatible products made with unknown ingredients under unknown manufacturing standards and will fully comply with local laws and the final FDA policy when effective.\"\n\nBill Sherman, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network\u2019s managing director of government relations, raised concerns that the governor\u2019s actions don't go far enough.\n\nHe urged Cuomo to immediately amend his proposal to include mint and menthol flavored e-cigarettes, which were exempted from the emergency rule.\n\n\u201cThis emergency rule has glaring holes that will allow the tobacco industry to continue to lure our kids with menthol e-cigarettes,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cMint and menthol are candy flavors to our kids. That\u2019s why at least 64 percent of the youth who report using e-cigarettes, use menthol e-cigarettes. \u2026 Without comprehensive actions tobacco companies will continue to lure our kids into addiction with menthol cigarettes and other flavored tobacco products like cigars and hookah.\u201d\n\nSherman said the state Legislature should \u201crestrict the sale of all flavored tobacco products including menthol cigarettes.\u201d\n\nData from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services suggests that fruit and menthol or mint e-cigarette flavors are by far the most popular among high school students who vape.\n\nThe governor\u2019s announcement came just days after he directed state agencies to launch educational awareness programs about youth e-cigarette use and to expand current school-based anti-tobacco programs and marketing campaigns to include the liquid nicotine products.\n\nCuomo, who called for banning flavored e-cigarettes last week, signed legislation, NY S301 (19R) / (NY A481 (19R), on Thursday to include e-cigarettes and liquid nicotine in New York's Tobacco Use Prevention and Control Program and issued an executive order requiring the incorporation of vaping and e-cigarette prevention into all state tobacco, anti-smoking or smoking cessation materials, programs and advocacy efforts.\n\nThe PHHPC, meanwhile, approved regulations Thursday requiring entities that sell vaping products in the state to post signage on the dangers of vaping.\n\nThe Trump administration also announced it is considering a ban on flavored e-cigarettes, although the governor said the state cannot wait on the federal government.\n\n\u201cWho knows what they will do, if they will do it,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWaiting for an effective FDA action is a fool\u2019s errand. We are on our own.\u201d\n\nDan Goldberg contributed to this report.", "description": "\u201cThis is a parallel to cigarettes,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here.\u201d", "authors": ["Amanda Eisenberg", "Shannon Young"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/31/bd/3d7de7684cb39f25b3b1b7d40f26/vaping.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
