It first emerged that NordVPN had an expired internal private keys exposed, potentially allowing anyone to spin out their own servers imitating NordVPN.\n\nVPN providers are increasingly popular as they ostensibly provide privacy from your internet provider and visiting sites about your internet browsing traffic. That\u2019s why journalists and activists often use these services, particularly when they\u2019re working in hostile states. These providers channel all of your internet traffic through one encrypted pipe, making it more difficult for anyone on the internet to see which sites you are visiting or which apps you are using. But often that means displacing your browsing history from your internet provider to your VPN provider. That\u2019s left many providers open to scrutiny, as often it\u2019s not clear if each provider is logging every site a user visits.\n\nFor its part, NordVPN has claimed a \u201czero logs\u201d policy. \u201cWe don\u2019t track, collect, or share your private data,\u201d the company says.\n\nBut the breach is likely to cause alarm that hackers may have been in a position to access some user data.\n\nNordVPN told TechCrunch that one of its datacenters was accessed in March 2018. \u201cOne of the datacenters in Finland we are renting our servers from was accessed with no authorization,\u201d said NordVPN spokesperson Laura Tyrell.\n\nThe attacker gained access to the server \u2014 which had been active for about a month \u2014 by exploiting an insecure remote management system left by the datacenter provider, which NordVPN said it was unaware that such a system existed.\n\nNordVPN did not name the datacenter provider.\n\n\u201cThe server itself did not contain any user activity logs; none of our applications send user-created credentials for authentication, so usernames and passwords couldn\u2019t have been intercepted either,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cOn the same note, the only possible way to abuse the website traffic was by performing a personalized and complicated man-in-the-middle attack to intercept a single connection that tried to access NordVPN.\u201d\n\nAccording to the spokesperson, the expired private key could not have been used to decrypt the VPN traffic on any other server.\n\nNordVPN said it found out about the breach a \u201cfew months ago,\u201d but the spokesperson said the breach was not disclosed until today because the company wanted to be \u201c100% sure that each component within our infrastructure is secure.\u201d\n\nA senior security researcher we spoke to who reviewed the statement and other evidence of the breach, but asked not to be named as they work for a company that requires authorization to speak to the press, called these findings \u201ctroubling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile this is unconfirmed and we await further forensic evidence, this is an indication of a full remote compromise of this provider\u2019s systems,\u201d the security researcher said. \u201cThat should be deeply concerning to anyone who uses or promotes these particular services.\u201d\n\nNordVPN said \u201cno other server on our network has been affected.\u201d\n\nBut the security researcher warned that NordVPN was ignoring the larger issue of the attacker\u2019s possible access across the network. \u201cYour car was just stolen and taken on a joy ride and you\u2019re quibbling about which buttons were pushed on the radio?\u201d the researcher said.\n\nThe company confirmed it had installed intrusion detection systems, a popular technology that companies use to detect early breaches, but \u201cno-one could know about an undisclosed remote management system left by the [datacenter] provider,\u201d said the spokesperson.\n\n\u201cThey spent millions on ads, but nothing on effective defensive security,\u201d they added.\n\nNordVPN was recently recommended by TechRadar and PCMag. CNET described it as its \u201cfavorite\u201d VPN provider.\n\nIt\u2019s also believed several other VPN providers may have been breached around the same time. Similar records posted online \u2014 and seen by TechCrunch \u2014 suggest that TorGuard and VikingVPN may have also been compromised, but spokespeople did not return a request for comment.\n\nGot a tip?
