The Salvation Army, which has scores of volunteers across the Bahamas, estimated that at least 13,000 homes were destroyed on one group of islands alone.\n\nCapt. Mike Michels with the Salvation Army in Kingston, Jamaica, said the reports coming in were bleak.\n\nHurricane Dorian cruise update: Extended vacation for some, delayed, canceled trips for others\n\nKeeping pets safe: How to get your pet ready as Hurricane Dorian gains strength\n\n\"We are seeing photos, videos of people up to their waist in water in their homes, and the water is rising,\" Michels told USA TODAY. \"The government is telling people to cut holes in their ceilings so they can't be trapped if the water rushes in. It's crazy.\"\n\nHurricane Dorian batters Bahamas as it nears U.S. coast More\n\nThe prolonged period of hurricane conditions was producing catastrophic damage across Grand Bahama, said the U.S National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"On this track, the core of extremely dangerous Hurricane Dorian will continue to pound Grand Bahama Island through much of today and tonight,\" the center warned.\n\nHurricane Dorian made its initial landfall Sunday at Elbow Cay, an 8-mile-long reef in the Abaco Islands. Then a Category 5 hurricane, Dorian was driving 185 mph winds, with gusts up to 220 mph \u2013 tying the record for the most powerful Atlantic hurricane to ever make landfall.\n\nThe hurricane then made landfall on Great Abaco Island, and again Sunday night along the eastern end of Grand Bahama Island, AccuWeather said.\n\n\"Grand Bahama is still feeling the impact,\" Prime Minister Hubert Minnis tweeted Monday. \"Based on reports out of Abaco, the devastation is unprecedented. ... Our focus right now is rescue, recovery and prayer.\"\n\nGrand Bahama is still feeling the impact of the Category 5 #HuricaneDorian. Based on reports out of Abaco, the devastation is unprecedented. Winds have decreased to 165MPH but Dorian remains an extremely dangerous storm. Our focus right now is rescue, recovery and prayer. \u2014 Dr Hubert Minnis (@minnis_dr) September 2, 2019\n\nMichels said the airport there is under 5 feet of water. It will take a week for the water to subside, and then at least another week for cleanup so the airport can reopen, he said. That is a problem for groups trying to get relief supplies to the island.\n\nVideo posted on social media out of Freeport, on Grand Bahama, showed water climbing toward roofs, up the stairs of homes, and to the tops of palm trees. Resident Dave Mackey recorded video showing water flowing like a river past his home.\n\n\u201cOur house is 15 feet up, and right now where that water is, is about 8 feet,\" Mackey told the Associated Press. \u201cWe come out of it with our lives, we\u2019re happy.\u201d\n\nMonday update: Historic Hurricane Dorian batters Bahamas with 155 mph winds, stalls on way toward Florida\n\nBroad power and communications outages made assessment of the damage difficult. The Bahamas Press reported that entire communities on Abacos were underwater, and that many locals were missing and feared dead.\n\nThe Press called Abacos a \"disaster,\" with no operable businesses and bodies floating in the water.\n\nPower was out since Sunday evening for many businesses and residents of New Providence, an island with more than 250,000 residents and home to the Bahamian capital of Nassau, the Press reported.
