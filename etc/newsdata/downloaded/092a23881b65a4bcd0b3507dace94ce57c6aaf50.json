It is too early to indicate any volumes,\" the statement said. \"At this point there are no observations of any oil spill at sea.\" Equinor also said it was mobilizing oil spill response resources \"as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"The white cylinders were covered with oil slick, and there were slicks going well around the facility and out into the road and the forest,\" says Sam Teicher, chief reef officer for Coral Vita, a local company that's seeking to re-seed reefs in the Bahamas. \"There were a few workers there assessing the damage, but very few people have been able to even get out to that point.\"\n\nImagery from the commercial satellite company Maxar shows what appears to be extensive damage at the facility. Several tanks are missing tops, and a slick of oil can be seen extending from the site.\n\nTeicher drove past the site Thursday and says he's worried a fire could start, groundwater could be contaminated or spillage could seep into the ocean. \"There are coral reefs near there, there are some pretty wonderful beeches and crystal clear oceans,\" he says.\n\nCoral reefs in the Bahamas have been dying off in recent years. Warming oceans due to climate change are partially to blame.\n\nTeicher says for now, though, he is mainly concerned with the people of Grand Bahama. The hurricane damage on the eastern side of the island is particularly severe.\n\n\"It was utter devastation out there,\" he says. \"In one town, High Rock, I would say 5% of the homes were still habitable. Some homes were completely gone, nothing remained.\"", "description": "Eyewitness images and satellite pictures show oil that seeped from tanks at a major storage terminal on the island's eastern side.
