In Texas parties in custody disputes can opt for a trial by jury, but a judge can review the decision.\n\nThe case has sparked outcry on the political right, with conservatives echoing Mr Younger's claims of child abuse.\n\nThe Texas attorney general said child protective services would investigate the abuse allegations involving the family from Coppell, a Dallas suburb.\n\nAs Judge Cooks issued her ruling, however, she said there was no evidence supporting charges of abuse by either Mr Younger or Ms Georgulas.\n\nBoth parents have been barred from speaking publicly about the case. For Mr Younger - who has strongly objected to treating his child as a girl - this means shutting down his website, Save James, which has attracted the support of the political right.\n\nMs Georgulas, a paediatrician, said her child - who has a twin brother - began to express a desire to be a girl in 2015, when the child was three, asking to wear dresses and look like the female characters from the Disney movie Frozen.\n\nMr Younger and Ms Georgulas' four-year marriage was annulled in 2016, at which point Ms Georgulas was given exclusive control of decisions regarding medical, psychological and educational issues.\n\n\"[The child] has been dressing as a girl in public, going to school in public as a girl, and requests that she be named Luna,\" a lawyer for Ms Georgulas, Kim Meaders, told a court last year.\n\nAt the child's five-year-old medical check-up, the doctor diagnosed the child with \"gender identity disorder\", Ms Georgulas testified.\n\nAfter the next annual check-up, the doctor wrote that child was \"still referring to self as female\".\n\nImage copyright Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images Image caption Texas Governor Greg Abbott says several state agencies were looking into the case\n\nAt trial, Ms Georgulas said psychologists had recommended that she allow the child \"to present in whatever way they wish\".\n\n\"The interviews with teachers, the counsellor's notes and records, Luna herself and Luna's brother all state Luna has always wanted to be a girl... It's not being forced upon her,\" Ms Meaders said.\n\nTherapists and counsellors who testified confirmed Ms Georgulas' account. Teachers at school call the child Luna.\n\nBut Mr Younger argued that his ex-wife had pressured their child to identify as transgender, saying in court that his child had been \"perfectly happy as a boy\".\n\nHe has been outspoken about the harms he believes are caused by a child beginning a gender transition.\n\n\"Children who are too young to make the choice can't make the choice,\" he said in trial.\n\nIn a podcast this year, Mr Younger described how upsetting it was for him to see his son during their video chats dressed as \"a drag queen\" with \"false eyelashes and makeup\".\n\nHe said in an interview with Texas conservative strategist Luke Macias he said that \"tampering\" with a young boy's gender identity amounted to sexual abuse.\n\nMr Younger added: \"The courts are not going to be fair to you. And the only way you can survive this and get your son through this alive is to calmly allow your son to be tortured right before your eyes and outlast the opposition.\"\n\nHe has said he would allow his child to dress as a girl upon reaching 18 years of age.\n\nThe \"wait-and-see\" approach, advocated by Mr Younger has been described as \"outdated\" by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).\n\nTreating children's chosen gender identities as \"possibly true\" can deny \"critical support\", according to the AAP.\n\nThe case has provoked heated response from conservatives, including President Donald Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr, and Texas Senator Ted Cruz.\n\n\"This is child abuse,\" Donald Trump Jr wrote in a tweet.\n\nAnnouncing the state inquiry, Attorney General Ken Paxton said on Thursday: \"Texans understand that children are cherished, unique individuals who should be supported and properly cared for as they grow up in communities.\"\n\nHe said the Department of Family and Protective Services would \"conduct a thorough investigation, and protect this child\".\n\nDuring the trial, Ms Georgulas said she would consider hormone suppression once the twin reaches puberty, and only if the child \"persists\" in identifying as a girl. Ms Georgulas had requested that the court demand written consent from both parents before any treatment involving hormone suppression, puberty blockers and transgender reassignment surgery.\n\nHormone suppression prevents the development of sex characteristics such as periods, breasts or voice-breaking.\n\nCritics have argued that such treatment would be inappropriate for so young a child.\n\nBut health professionals stress that hormone suppressors are never used for a pre-pubescent children. They emphasise that hormone suppressors are only prescribed at a certain stage of puberty (\"Tanner Stage 2\" - typically between the ages of 10-14) and that the drugs' effects are reversible.\n\nLaura Edwards-Leeper, a clinical psychologist at Pacific University who specialises in gender identity says he finds it astonishing that \"people believe that medical providers are offering treatment to young children\".\n\n\"When there are headlines about sex changes in children, that is completely not true,\" he told the BBC.\n\nIn addition to a physician, many patients will also be seen by a therapist for an assessment, like Dr Edwards-Leeper, before being prescribed puberty blockers.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chile's Amaranta school is believed to be the first in the world created for transgender children\n\nEchoing Dr Edwards-Leeper, psychotherapist Wesley Parks said at trial that it \"wouldn't be possible\" for Ms Georgulas and Mr Younger's child to take hormone blockers at the age of seven.\n\nPuberty blockers are \"critical\" for children who are struggling with their gender identity, Dr Edwards-Leeper said. It \"alleviates the distress that puberty causes for many of these kids before they have to make a decision about possibly irreversible interventions\".\n\nEven for the \"handful\" of her patients who have chosen to go off the hormone blockers, Dr Edwards-Leeper has observed no psychological harm to the temporary delay in puberty.\n\n\"It's completely false to say supporting a young child in their affirmed gender is child abuse,\" Dr Edwards-Leeper said. \"It's in the child's best interest.\"\n\nRecent estimates place the number of transgender adults in the US at 1.4 million - 0.6% of the population age 18 or older.\n\nA transgender person is someone who experiences a gender identity which differs from that of their assigned sex at birth.", "description": "The court battle between the Dallas parents has sparked debate on the gender identity of children.", "authors": ["Holly Honderich", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8F08/production/_109361663_img_0097-884x1024-1160x665.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
