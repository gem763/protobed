REUTERS/Umit Bektas/File Photo\n\nThe Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement-North, a rebel group in the states of Blue Nile and South Kordofan, accused Sudan\u2019s Rapid Support Forces (RSF), its most powerful paramilitary group, of occupying new areas and attacking and arresting traders.\n\nIn a press conference in Juba, SPLM-N chief negotiator Ammar Amoun said that his group\u2019s preconditions to returning to the negotiating table include the release of all prisoners, the withdrawal of government forces from areas they\u2019ve taken and a halt to all hostilities.\n\n\u201cIf the government clears all these demands, we are ready to come back to the table with the commitment we declared during the Juba Declaration\u201d, Amoun said.\n\nThe Sudanese government denied the accusations and said it was willing to investigate.\n\n\u201cThe government is shocked,\u201d said spokesman Mohammed Hassan Eltaishi. \u201cThe government is ready to investigate those behind the attack (on traders) and will bring them to justice..this incident should not be a big obstacle to the ongoing peace negotiations,\u201d he added.\n\nSudan\u2019s ruling council and rebel leaders resumed peace talks on Monday to end the country\u2019s multiple conflicts, a key condition for the country\u2019s removal from the United States\u2019 sponsors of terrorism list.\n\nMediators said in a statement late on Wednesday that the talks were postponed to Thursday \u201cin order to resolve this misunderstanding.\u201d\n\nThe council, a transitional government, has made peace talks with rebels fighting Khartoum one of its main priorities.\n\nBeing designated a state sponsor of terrorism cuts Sudan off from desperately needed debt relief and financing from lenders such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
