To that end, let\u2019s look at how the newly announced Echo Studio stacks up to both its older Echo siblings, as well as the high-end models from Amazon\u2019s competitors.\n\nAudio quality\n\nThe Echo Studio seems to be a major upgrade over its predecessors for sheer audio output. The Echo Studio features a one-inch tweeter, three two-inch midrange speakers, and a 5.25-inch woofer, which is quite a bit more compared to the 0.8-inch tweeter and three-inch woofer found in the third-generation Echo (which was also recently announced, and will be replacing the previous Echo models when it arrives on October 17 in the U.S. for $149 [Australian release date yet to be confirmed]).\n\nThe Echo Studio is also the first Echo device to feature automatic room tuning, which adjusts the speaker\u2019s audio output to better suit your room\u2019s acoustics (measured via seven microphones in the device\u2019s top). Many other smart speakers have had this feature for some time, and it\u2019s good to see Amazon finally include it.\n\nThe real question is whether the Echo Studio is any better than the high-end speaker options from Amazon\u2019s rivals \u2014 specifically the Apple HomePod and Google Home Max. We haven\u2019t heard the Echo Studio for ourselves so we can\u2019t comment on its quality; On paper, it\u2019s not a huge difference between most other smart speakers in the $300 - $600 range.\n\nThe Echo Studio will run for $329, however, which is a full $200 cheaper than either the Home Max or HomePod. If it can come close to matching its rivals for audio performance, that would be a strong plus for the Echo Studio, especially when you factor in all the extra features Amazon has managed to stuff into its new high-end smart speaker.\n\nExtra features and device support\n\nAs with other smart speakers, users can pair two Echo Studios together to create a dual-speaker stereo setup, but the Studio Plus can also pair up wirelessly with Fire TV devices to act as a self-contained home audio solution. Some may balk at the idea of using a smart speaker instead of, say, a sound bar or even a 5.1 speaker setup \u2014 many of which cost only slightly more and likely have much better audio\u2014but the Studio Echo at least can match some of these products when it comes to 3D audio and device connectivity (at least on paper).\n\nThe Echo Studio is the first smart speaker to offer 3D audio via Dolby Atmos or Sony 360 Reality audio. You\u2019ll also be able to pair up the Echo Studio with a wide variety of playback devices and other smart home products via 3.5mm and mini optical Toslink ports, or wirelessly over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or Zigbee. That\u2019s a much wider variety of inputs compared the HomePod\u2019s AirDrop-only connectivity, or the Google Home Max\u2019s 3.5mm, Bluetooth, or Google Cast options.\n\nBeing an Echo device, the Echo Studio is powered by Alexa... and only Alexa. This isn\u2019t all that different from how Apple\u2019s HomePod runs with Siri or the Google Home Max uses Google Assistant \u2014 which makes sense given they\u2019re all first-party devices \u2014 but many third-party speakers support two or more. It\u2019s an understandable limitation, but a limitation nonetheless.\n\nShould you buy an Echo Studio?\n\nFor Amazon users who want an Amazon-branded smart speaker for listening to Amazon Music HD, the Echo Studio is the best Echo device for the job. Conversely, if you\u2019re enmeshed in either Apple or Google\u2019s ecosystems, then there\u2019s little point in investing in an Alexa-only device like the Echo Studio.\n\nFinally, we have those folks who either have yet to pick which smart home platform to go with, or who use a plurality of devices from multiple brands. I would suggest multi-platform users check out some of the options from brands like Sonos or Paradigm first, but keep the Echo Studio in mind; its $329 price tag makes it not only one of the more affordable high-end smart speakers currently out there, but it also will nab you some cool extra features that we haven\u2019t seen available from most other brands just yet.", "description": "Echo Speakers have excellent features that make them great for Alexa-powered smart home setups, but they\u2019re not necessarily known for stellar audio quality, especially Amazon\u2019s more affordable options....", "authors": ["Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/s7pkmgemcljlnpgkasgt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
