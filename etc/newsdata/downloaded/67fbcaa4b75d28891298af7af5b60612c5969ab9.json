So now what?\n\nAs Democrats probe President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to have Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, lawmakers could go to court to compel witnesses or documents. Or, they may simply plow ahead, potentially making obstruction an article of impeachment.\n\nTo force compliance with subpoenas, lawmakers could go to federal court. Fighting the administration that way could ultimately wind up in the Supreme Court, experts say.\n\nRead: White House tells House it won\u2019t cooperate with impeachment inquiry\n\n\u201cIf [Democrats] go to court, it would be a federal district court\u201d in Washington, said Michael Gerhardt, a law-school professor at the University of North Carolina, speaking to MarketWatch. \u201cIf they do go to court it will likely end up in the Supreme Court, which may well side with Trump.\u201d\n\nEven before the White House said Tuesday it was ordering a \u201cfull halt\u201d on cooperating with the impeachment probe, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Democrats could move on two separate tracks.\n\n\u201cI do not foreclose at all other efforts in parallel to make sure we fully find out all the facts, including court,\u201d the California Democrat reportedly told the Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent. Schiff said if the White House fought the efforts, \u201cthat will not delay us from going forward with articles of impeachment if they are warranted by the president\u2019s obstruction.\u201d\n\nIn stating the administration\u2019s refusal to comply with Democrats\u2019 investigation, White House lawyers objected to the House\u2019s not formally voting to begin the impeachment inquiry. And, they said, Trump\u2019s due-process rights were being violated.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi has said the House is within its rules in conducting executive-branch oversight without such a vote.\n\nComments by Schiff suggest Democrats may make obstruction an article of impeachment. In remarks Tuesday, he called the State Department\u2019s blocking of U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland\u2019s planned congressional testimony \u201cadditional, strong evidence\u201d of obstruction. Last week, Schiff pointedly noted to reporters that obstruction of justice was one of the impeachment articles faced by then\u2013President Richard Nixon in 1974.\n\nNixon resigned before he could be impeached. In the late former president\u2019s case, the Supreme Court didn\u2019t protect him. He quit about two weeks after a high court ruling that led to the release of the Watergate tapes.\n\nOpinion: As Trump White House boycotts the impeachment inquiry, remember that it only takes 20 to convict", "description": "The Trump administration has told congressional Democrats it won\u2019t cooperate with their impeachment inquiry.
