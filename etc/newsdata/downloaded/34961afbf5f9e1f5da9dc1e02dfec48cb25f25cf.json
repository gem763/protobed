The stoic first baseman still had work to do.\n\nGoldschmidt smacked a two-run homer in his Chase Field reunion, Yadier Molina also had a two-run shot, and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Diamondbacks 9-7 Monday night for their sixth straight win.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all what you make of it, and for me this was just another game,\u201d Goldschmidt said. \u201cI\u2019m appreciative of all the fans coming out, cheering me on, the standing ovation. But I just didn\u2019t want to make too big a deal of it.\u201d\n\nFor Goldschmidt, the real importance of the game was that his team won again.\n\nThe Cardinals have a 3 1/2-game lead over the Milwaukee Brewers in the NL Central. St. Louis has five games remaining in the regular season while Milwaukee has six.\n\nThe Diamondbacks - who have hung around the fringes of the NL wild-card race for months - were officially eliminated from postseason contention.\n\n\u201cWe left some money on the table throughout the course of the season and those are the things that we are going to have to address and tighten up a little bit,\u201d Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said.\n\nGoldschmidt had a big night in his return to Arizona after playing eight years for the Diamondbacks from 2011-18. He got a loud ovation from fans in the first inning before drawing a walk.\n\nIn the third, he drove a change-up from Alex Young just over the right-center field fence for his 32nd homer of the season and 100th in his career at Chase Field, which is the most in the stadium\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cGood for Goldy,\u201d St. Louis manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cObviously, in the moment, but it\u2019s just a really special return for him I\u2019m sure. Really class job with the tribute.\u201d\n\nAdam Wainwright (14-9) won his fifth straight start, though he didn\u2019t have his best stuff. He gave up eight hits and five runs over five innings.\n\nYoung (7-5) gave up six earned runs over five innings. He struck out five and walked two.\n\nArizona fell behind 6-2 in the fifth inning after Molina\u2019s two-run homer, but scored three runs off Wainwright in the fifth to pull within one.\n\nSt. Louis got breathing room in the eighth inning when Harrison Bader ripped a solo homer to left field and the offense added two more runs in the ninth. Carlos Mart\u00ednez earned his 24th save.\n\nThe Cardinals were sharp in another win despite coming off an intense four-game sweep of the Chicago Cubs, who are also fighting for playoff position. Goldschmidt said the team\u2019s stoic personality has been an asset.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get too down or too excited,\u201d Goldschmidt said. \u201cWe just play hard every day.\u201d\n\nGOLDY\u2019S RETURN\n\nGoldschmidt acknowledged the crowd after the video tribute, waving his hat.\n\nThe 32-year-old first baseman hit .297 with 209 homers and 710 RBIs in his Diamondbacks tenure while helping the team make the playoffs in 2011 and \u201817. He also made six NL All-Star teams and won three Gold Gloves.\n\nHe was traded during the offseason for catcher Carson Kelly, pitcher Luke Weaver, infielder Andy Young and a draft pick.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nDiamondbacks: Lovullo said RHP Taijuan Walker (Tommy John surgery) threw a 20-pitch bullpen session and the pitcher \u201cwas very encouraged\u201d by the outing. If Walker still feels good on Tuesday, he could pitch in a game before the end of the season on Sunday. \u2026 RHP Weaver could pitch in another game this season after a successful return on Sunday. Weaver (forearm tightness) threw two scoreless innings against the Padres in his first outing since May 26.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCardinals: St. Louis will start RHP Jack Flaherty (10-8, 2.96 ERA). He gave up just one run over eight innings in a win over the Cubs on Friday. He threw a season-high 118 pitches.\n\nDiamondbacks: Arizona will start RHP Mike Leake (12-11, 4.38). He\u2019s 3-1 with a 2.48 ERA over his last five starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Arizona Diamondbacks made it obvious they appreciated Paul Goldschmidt in his return to the desert, honoring him with a tribute video before the game and multiple ovations throughout the evening.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Brandt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/cardinals_diamondbacks_baseball_94909_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
