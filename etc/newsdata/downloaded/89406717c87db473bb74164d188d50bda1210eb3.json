Bok pack demolished Japan\n\n\n\nCall their game plan boring, but the Springboks' win was built on a dominant performance up front.\n\n\n\nThe Bok pack laid the foundation for the victory as they eventually sucked the life out of Japan.\n\n\n\nCoach Rassie Erasmus' game plan proved effective in keeping the game a slow as possible and not playing to fast-paced Japan's strengths.\n\n\n\nJapan looked dangerous at times in the first half, but eventually ran out of puff against a staunch Springbok defence.\n\n\n\nApart from one lost scrum when they were down to seven forwards, the Boks dominated this set piece and also won all 10 of their own lineouts, while stealing five of Japan's 13.\n\n\n\n2. Man-of-the-match Faf grabs attention\n\n\n\nBok scrumhalf Faf de Klerk may have received the official man-of-the-match award but it was his excessive use of the box kick that riled up many a Springbok fan.\n\nTo his credit, De Klerk did some good things - he scored a try after a dominant Springbok maul, set up Makazole Mapimpi's first try by going blindside at a scrum and defended like a Trojan throughout - but his kicks from the base caused somewhat of a stir on social media.\n\n\n\nDe Klerk is clearly under instruction to do so, but one feels his execution needs to improve.\n\n\n\nIn the semi-finals - and a possible final - the Springboks cannot afford to kick away so much well-earned possession.\n\n\n\n3. Beast lucky to see only yellow?\n\n\n\nMany pundits felt Springbok prop Tendai \"Beast\" Mtawarira was a tad lucky to only receive a yellow card for a tip tackle on Japanese prop Keita Inagaki in the 10th minute.\n\n\n\nI felt English referee Wayne Barnes made the right call because Inagaki did not fall on his head.\n\nThe following tweet perhaps summed the incident quite well:\n\nBeast is saved from red by the Japanese player extending his elbow. Crazy that the effect/consequence is sanctioned, not the act itself.\n\n\n\nAct itself deserves a red. But the consequence means it\u2019s yellow.\n\n\n\nBarnes assured as always. Makes the right call. \u2014 Runningflyhalf (@Runningflyhalf) October 20, 2019\n\nOne thing is certain, a red card for Mtawarira would have changed the whole complexion of the match...\n\n4. Food for thought at fullback...\n\n\n\nThe erratic performance of Springbok fullback Willie le Roux may prompt coach Rassie Erasmus to rethink his selection at the back.\n\nLe Roux had a terrible first half, with his passing and handling letting him down badly, while he also looked shaky under the high ball.\n\n\n\nTo his credit, Le Roux improved in the second stanza but he'll need to up his game ahead of the semi-final against Wales.\n\nLe Roux is an experienced campaigner and will play his 60th Test if he gets picked for the semi-final, but one wonders whether Erasmus will ponder over the possible inclusion of either Warrick Gelant, Frans Steyn or Damian Willemse in the No 15 jumper.\n\nREAD Rob Houwing's take - Boks in semi: Can they risk wonky Willie?\n\n5. A Bok standout\n\n\n\nHe has copped some flak in recent times for being one dimensional, but I thought Springbok centre Damian de Allende was a standout player at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.\n\n\n\nThe inside centre was South Africa's go-to ball carrier - his nine carries the most of any Springbok - and also racked up an impressive 14 tackles.\n\nDe Allende fits the type of game style the Boks want to employ and will prove a handful for the Welsh.\n\n", "description": "<strong>Herman Mostert</strong> highlights FIVE talking points following South Africa\u2019s 26-3 Rugby World Cup quarter-final win over Japan in Tokyo.", "authors": ["Herman Mostert -"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2872/38f2a4a1fa0642159d28e2fe004712d1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
