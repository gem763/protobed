It is an issue he embraced years earlier than most and one which he genuinely cares about.\n\nBut just as he apparently sees no conflict between his concern for some animals and his enthusiasm for hunting or shooting other species, so Prince Charles seems oblivious to the damage he himself causes while cajoling the rest of us to minimise our green footprint.\n\nSome would classify it as simple hypocrisy, others as some sort of Orwellian doublethink where he can hold two contradictory positions at the same time. Perhaps it boils down to arrogance.\n\nThe Royal accounts for 2018-19, the latest available, show that Charles tops the list for travel extravagance once again, burning through \u00a31.13 million in a year. He is pictured with the Duchess of Cornwall in Africa\n\nIt is in matters to do with travel where we see the greatest disconnect between what Charles says and what Charles does.\n\nThe Prince clearly understands the threat from climate change and has articulated both the extent of the problem and the need for urgent and far-reaching action.\n\nHe has personally implemented a number of green measures, too. In its 2007 Annual Review, for instance, the Duchy of Cornwall \u2013 a vast estate that is effectively owned by the Prince of Wales \u2013 said it had managed to reduce carbon emissions by nine per cent.\n\nWith the exception of the Prince\u2019s Aston Martin, which was by then only covering 100 miles a year, all the Duchy vehicles were running on biodiesel, said the report.\n\nBy 2008, even the Aston Martin had been converted to run on bioethanol produced from surplus wine.\n\nMeghan is pictured cradling son Archie on the tarmac. The only real response from the Windsors has been to attempt to choke off the supply of information. Twenty years ago, the annual list itemised all journeys costing more than \u00a3500. By 2010, the threshold had been raised to \u00a310,000\n\nOn one occasion, when we shared a platform at a Prince\u2019s Trust event, Charles proudly told me \u2013 apropos of nothing \u2013 that the Royal Train was now running on used cooking oil.\n\nI congratulated him, and meant it, even if the Royal Train is hugely expensive. It costs well over \u00a3500,000 a year just to maintain, before it has moved an inch.\n\nBy 2007, the Prince was urging all his staff to cycle to work, although he had no plans to do so himself.\n\nThat same year, he made a commitment to using public transport \u2018where appropriate\u2019, though it appears to have been appropriate on very few occasions.\n\nSadly, these small but worthwhile moves pale into insignificance when Charles\u2019s flying habits are factored in.\n\nAir travel is an enormous generator of greenhouse gases and the Prince must be aware of this.\n\nYet when Charles was given the Harvard Club\u2019s Global Environmental Citizen Award in 2007, he decided to pick up the award by commandeering the entire first-class cabin of a jumbo and flying to Philadelphia with an entourage of 20.\n\nAndrew is pictured coming down the steps of his private chartered plane in India in 2012. As the latest accounts make clear, it is business as usual for the pampered Windsors, and the result has been a doubling of carbon emissions from Royal travel in the course of the year, up from 1,687 to 3,344 tons\n\nAt public expense. Such bloated arrangements are par for the course, unfortunately.\n\nIn April 2018, the Prince took 13 Clarence House staff with him to the Commonwealth Games in Queensland, at a cost of \u00a3155,000 to the taxpayer in transport alone.\n\nHis entourage included a doctor, a dresser, a valet and someone called a travelling yeoman, whose exact responsibilities seemed unclear.\n\nIt later emerged that the yeoman was involved in choosing Charles\u2019s clothes, which makes you wonder what the valet and dresser were doing. In July 2017, the Prince ran up a travel bill of \u00a330,414 for a one-day trip on a charter plane to Belgium.\n\nPresumably it was not \u2018appropriate\u2019 to take the excellent Eurostar service direct from London to Brussels.\n\nIn October that same year, Prince Edward and his wife Sophie managed a five-day trip all the way to Brunei for a comparatively modest \u00a321,000 \u2013 around two-thirds of the cost of Charles\u2019s Belgian jaunt.\n\nOfficially, we are asked to believe that the Royal Household carefully weighs up the options for each journey, balancing matters such as safety, value for money, and the length of the journey. Charles is pictured getting into a car in Germany earlier this year\n\nWhen Charles and his wife Camilla made their own trip to Brunei, India, Malaysia and Singapore that very same month, they used the RAF\u2019s special VIP transport jet \u2013 a converted Voyager tanker \u2013 which cost the taxpayer a whopping \u00a3362,149.\n\nFor the year 2017-18, Charles spent a total of well over \u00a3700,000 on journeys that each cost more than \u00a315,000 (the figure at which they are publicly recorded.)\n\nThe total would have been even higher when individual flights that cost less than \u00a315,000 were also factored in.\n\nThe Royal accounts for 2018-19, the latest available, show that Charles tops the list for travel extravagance once again, burning through \u00a31.13 million in a year.\n\nThey show that even a simple trip to France and Greece cost \u00a3159,820 \u2013 but then the RAF Voyager does not come cheap.\n\nThe Palace argues that journeys are undertaken at the request of the Government and indeed they often are but nobody in government demands the use of private jets and helicopters that greatly increase carbon emissions.\n\nAnd nobody has required the Royals to waste \u00a3200,000 on private jets in this one year to ferry them between London and their private residences in Scotland, such as Balmoral.\n\nOfficially, we are asked to believe that the Royal Household carefully weighs up the options for each journey, balancing matters such as safety, value for money, and the length of the journey.\n\nA few, including the Queen and Princess Anne, genuinely seem to do this but most clearly do not. It is an attitude that combines arrogance and hypocrisy in equal measure.\n\nThe truth is that private jets are now the default option for the Prince of Wales. As the latest accounts make clear, it is business as usual for the pampered Windsors, and the result has been a doubling of carbon emissions from Royal travel in the course of the year, up from 1,687 to 3,344 tons.\n\nAs someone once put it to me: \u2018The Royal Family wants to travel on magic carpets.\u2019\n\nThe only real response from the Windsors has been to attempt to choke off the supply of information. Twenty years ago, the annual list itemised all journeys costing more than \u00a3500.\n\nBy 2010, the threshold had been raised to \u00a310,000. The figure was upped again in 2016 to \u00a315,000, conveniently hiding all those gratuitous helicopter journeys, 202 of them that year, or around four a week, as well as 43 charter flights that now slip in just under the bar.\n\nAs most journeys by Royal Train cost just over \u00a315,000, can we expect the reporting threshold to be raised to \u00a320,000 soon?\n\nChallenging Charles for the dubious honour of the Royal who costs the taxpayer most per mile \u2013 and who emits the greatest amount of carbon \u2013 is Prince Andrew.\n\nIn 2005, the National Audit Office (NAO), normally sober and careful with its public comments, produced a blistering attack.\n\nIt revealed that in just 12 months, the Duke of York ran up an expense sheet totalling \u00a3325,000 on helicopters and planes, including a \u00a33,000 helicopter trip from London to Oxford, and a \u00a34,686 return journey from London to Scotland aboard a Ministry of Defence 32 Squadron aircraft.\n\nRemember Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, lampooned as \u2018Two Jags\u2019 when he was busy lecturing us on climate change? The cost to the planet \u2013 and the taxpayer \u2013 of running two Jaguars is a tiny fraction of the cost of a single journey by helicopter or private jet\n\nSir John Bourn, the then head of the NAO, noted that a return flight to London was available for \u00a3254 and pointed out acidly that the Duke\u2019s next Royal engagement was four days later. Which is to say there was no particular rush.\n\nWhen the Palace is questioned about the Prince\u2019s lavish travel arrangements, it says only that \u2018the Duke has also used public transport in the past\u2019.\n\nIs that the best line they can come up with? Perhaps it is. Andrew\u2019s attitude to the public purse is typified by a trip he made to India in 2012.\n\nInstead of taking up the offer of staying at the British High Commissioner\u2019s luxury Delhi residence, as Charles had done on a previous visit, Andrew insisted on checking in to the Maharaja suite at the Leela Palace, just about the most expensive hotel suite in the city. The Foreign Office should have shown some backbone and refused to pay.\n\nAndrew is even happy to call on public money in order to pursue his golfing interests. In June 2006, the Government finally answered my questions about his use of the MoD 32 Squadron aircraft in 2004.\n\nIt was finally admitted that a first \u2018official duty\u2019 had involved his attendance at a meeting of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club in St Andrews.\n\nThe countryside champion's blots on the landscape The Prince of Wales has regularly intervened in architectural matters to defend the countryside or to champion traditional design. He famously derailed the proposed extension to the National Gallery back in 1984, calling the design a \u2018monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend\u2019. In 2002, he threatened to withdraw his patronage from the National Trust if it proceeded with a design for its new Swindon headquarters. And in 2009, he was accused by leading architect Richard Rogers of subverting the planning system when he called in a Royal favour to scupper plans for the redevelopment of Chelsea Barracks. Yet not all inappropriate development has upset him. In 2011, he infuriated locals in Truro by proposing to build 98 mock-Georgian houses and a supermarket equipped with 1,200 parking spaces on farmland next to the town. Then there was his plan a couple of years earlier to build 2,000 new homes on Duchy of Cornwall land, which he owns, west of Bath. This green belt countryside was home to kestrels and buzzards, hares and deer. And let us not forget the proposal by the Duchy to wipe out a wildlife sanctuary on the edge of Newquay in order to build a 200-home \u2018eco-village\u2019. In 2006, Charles allowed the cultivation of alien Pacific oysters in the Lower Fal estuary and Helford river in Cornwall, thus providing another handy income stream for the Duchy, which owns 85 per cent of the stretches of water in question and the whole of the riverbeds. The problem is that these Pacific oysters are highly destructive to the marine environment. In 2008, Natural England warned about the marine damage being caused to these beautiful stretches of water. It transpired that the Duchy had failed to carry out an environmental impact assessment, as required by law, before issuing the licence. No prosecution followed and with the passage of time, the fears about the damage these invasive non-native species can do has proved to be sadly accurate. Meanwhile, the alien oysters turn up in expensive London restaurants and are described as \u2018sustainable\u2019.\n\nIn fact, a contribution of \u00a3636 had been made towards each flight \u2013 there and back \u2013 to defray costs, though naturally not by Andrew. Rather, this was paid by the R&A.\n\nThe second occasion was his attendance at a meeting of the Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland.\n\nOn each trip, Andrew attended an official event nearby. Was this a device that allowed him to charge the whole cost to the Government?\n\nOver the years, there has been a curious overlap between Andrew\u2019s Royal duties and the proximity of golf courses. Just months after the blistering NAO report, he used the Royal Flight to visit Orkney, where once again he managed to take in a round of golf.\n\nIn 2009, he racked up a bill of some \u00a32,000 for a helicopter to take him 113 miles from Windsor to a golf course in Kent where a party was taking place.\n\nHe spent about an hour at the Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club in Deal, where he spoke exclusively about golf before leaving. A spokesman claimed it was \u2018an entirely justifiable expense\u2019.\n\nExtravagance is nothing new for the Windsors. When Prince Philip sailed off for months aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia in 1956, he racked up a bill of at least \u00a32 million.\n\nThe cost was increased by his demand for a \u2018commando raft\u2019 to unload his Rolls-Royce at places where there were no car-docking facilities. He also travelled with his own sports car.\n\nPrincess Margaret commandeered the Royal Yacht for 44 days for her honeymoon the following year \u2013 and ate up \u00a31 million of public money in the process.\n\nAs she lounged on deck sipping cocktails and taking in the sun, it would be nice to think she spared a thought for those poorly paid British Servicemen who had suffered a deduction in wages in order to club together for a wedding present for her.\n\nNormal standards simply didn\u2019t apply then and they don\u2019t now. Remember Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, lampooned as \u2018Two Jags\u2019 when he was busy lecturing us on climate change?\n\nThe cost to the planet \u2013 and the taxpayer \u2013 of running two Jaguars is a tiny fraction of the cost of a single journey by helicopter or private jet. Prescott, moreover, was democratically elected.\n\nWe cannot run Prince Andrew out of office because he is an hereditary fixture. We are stuck with him.\n\n\u00a9 Norman Baker, 2019\n\nl What Do You Do? What The Royal Family Don\u2019t Want You To Know, by Norman Baker, is published by Biteback, priced \u00a320.
