Back then, Theranos was a revolutionary idea thought up by a woman hailed as a genius who styled herself as a female Steve Jobs. Holmes was the world\u2019s youngest female self-made billionaire, and Theranos was one Silicon Valley\u2019s unicorn startups.\n\nThen it all came crashing down.\n\nThe shortcomings and inaccuracies of Theranos\u2019s technology were exposed, along with the role Holmes played in covering it all up. Theranos and Holmes were charged with massive fraud, and the company was forced to close its labs and testing centers.\n\nThis is how Holmes went from precocious child to ambitious Stanford dropout to embattled startup CEO.\n\nElizabeth Holmes was born on February 3, 1984 in Washington, D.C. Her mom, Noel, was a Congressional committee staffer, and her dad, Christian Holmes, worked for Enron before moving to government agencies like USAID.\n\nSource: Elizabeth Holmes/Twitter, CNN, Vanity Fair\n\nHolmes\u2019 family moved when she was young, from Washington, D.C. to Houston.\n\nsource Orhan Cam/Shutterstock\n\nSource: Fortune\n\nAt the age of 9, Holmes wrote a letter to her father: \u201cWhat I really want out of life is to discover something new, something that mankind didn\u2019t know was possible to do.\u201d\n\nsource REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\nSource: CBS News\n\nWhen she was a teenager, Holmes started her own business: she sold C++ compilers, a type of software that translates computer code, to Chinese schools.\n\nsource Tyrone Siu/Reuters\n\nSource: Fortune\n\nHolmes was inspired by her great-great-grandfather Christian Holmes, a surgeon, to go into medicine, but she discovered she was terrified of needles. Later, this would influence her to start Theranos.\n\nSource: San Francisco Business Times\n\nHolmes went to Stanford to study chemical engineering. When she was a freshman, she became a \u201cpresident\u2019s scholar,\u201d an honor which came with a $3,000 stipend to go toward a research project.\n\nSource: Fortune\n\nHolmes spent the summer after her freshman year interning at the Genome Institute in Singapore. She got the job partly because she spoke Mandarin, which she learned as a teenager.\n\nSource: Fortune\n\nAs a sophomore, Holmes went to one of her professors, Channing Robertson, and said: \u201cLet\u2019s start a company.\u201d With his blessing, she founded Real-Time Cures, later changing the company\u2019s name to Theranos.\n\nsource Getty Images\n\nSource: Fortune, Wired\n\nHolmes soon filed a patent application for \u201cMedical device for analyte monitoring and drug delivery,\u201d a wearable device that would administer medication, monitor patients\u2019 blood, and adjust the dosage as needed.\n\nSource: Fortune, US Patent Office\n\nBy the next semester, Holmes had dropped out of Stanford altogether, working on Theranos in the basement of a college house.\n\nSource: Wall Street Journal\n\nTheranos\u2019s business model was based around the idea that it ran blood tests using proprietary technology that required only pinprick in your finger and a small amount of blood. Holmes said the tests would be able to detect medical conditions like cancer and high cholesterol.\n\nsource Steve Jennings/Getty Images\n\nSource: Wall Street Journal\n\nHolmes started raising venture capital money for Theranos from prominent investors like Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Larry Ellison. To date, Theranos has raised more than $700 million.\n\nsource Justin Sullivan/Getty\n\nSource: SEC, Crunchbase\n\nHolmes took investors\u2019 money on the condition that she wouldn\u2019t have to reveal how Theranos\u2019 technology worked. Plus, she would have final say over everything having to do with the company.\n\nsource JP Yim/Getty\n\nSource: Vanity Fair\n\nThat obsession with secrecy extended to every aspect of Theranos. For the first decade Holmes spent building her company, Theranos operated in stealth mode. She even took three former Theranos employees to court, claiming they had misused Theranos trade secrets.\n\nsource Kimberly White/Getty\n\nSource: San Francisco Business Times\n\nHolmes\u2019 attitude toward secrecy was borrowed from a Silicon Valley hero of hers: Steve Jobs. Holmes started wearing black turtlenecks like Jobs, decorated her office with his favorite furniture, and like Jobs, never took vacations.\n\nsource Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nSource: Vanity Fair\n\nEven Holmes\u2019s uncharacteristically deep voice may have been part of a carefully crafted image intended to help her fit in in the male-dominated business world.\n\nsource Lucas Jackson/Reuters\n\nSource: STAT News, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup\n\nShortly after Holmes dropped out of Stanford at age 19, she had been dating Theranos president and COO Sunny Balwani, who was 20 years her senior. The pair broke up in spring 2016 when Holmes pushed him out of the company.\n\nsource Taylor Hill/Getty Images\n\nSource: STAT News, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup\n\nAs Theranos started to rake in millions of funding, Holmes became the subject of media attention and acclaim in the tech world. She graced the covers of Fortune and Forbes, gave a TED Talk, and spoke on panels with Bill Clinton and Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma.\n\nsource Andrew Burton/Getty Images\n\nSource: Vanity Fair\n\nTheranos quickly began securing outside partnerships. Capital Blue Cross and Cleveland Clinic signed on to offer Theranos tests to their patients, and Walgreens made a deal to open Theranos testing centers. Theranos also formed a secret partnership with Safeway worth $350 million.\n\nsource Melia Robinson/Tech Insider\n\nSource: Wired, Business Insider\n\nAt one point, Holmes was the world\u2019s youngest self-made female billionaire with a net-worth of around $4.5 billion.\n\nsource Kimberly White/Getty Images for Breakthrough Prize\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nAround the same time, questions were being raised about Theranos\u2019s technology. Ian Gibbons \u2014 chief scientist at Theranos and one of the company\u2019s first hires \u2014 warned Holmes that the tests weren\u2019t ready for the public to take, and that there were inaccuracies in the technology. Outside scientists began voicing their concerns about Theranos, too.\n\nsource Melia Robinson/Tech Insider\n\nSource: Vanity Fair, Business Insider\n\nBy August 2015, the FDA began investigating Theranos, and regulators from the government body that oversees laboratories found \u201cmajor inaccuracies\u201d in the testing Theranos was doing on patients.\n\nsource Mike Segar/Reuters\n\nSource: Vanity Fair\n\nBy October 2015, Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou published his investigation into Theranos\u2019s struggles with its technology. Carreyrou\u2019s reporting sparked the beginning of the company\u2019s downward spiral.\n\nsource Shutterstock\n\nSource: Wall Street Journal\n\nCarreyrou found that Theranos\u2019 blood-testing machine, named Edison, couldn\u2019t give accurate results, so Theranos was running its samples through the same machines used by traditional blood-testing companies.\n\nSource: Wall Street Journal\n\nHolmes appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money\u201d to defend herself and her company. \u201cThis is what happens when you work to change things, and first they think you\u2019re crazy, then they fight you, and then all of a sudden you change the world,\u201d Holmes said.\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nBy 2016, the FDA, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and SEC were all looking into Theranos.\n\nsource Getty\n\nSource: Wall Street Journal, Wired\n\nIn July 2016, Holmes was banned from the lab-testing industry for two years. By October, Theranos had shut down lab operations and wellness centers.\n\nsource Mike Blake/Reuters\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nIn March 2018, Theranos, Holmes, and Balwani were charged with \u201cmassive fraud\u201d by the SEC. Holmes agreed to give up financial and voting control of the company, pay a $500,000 fine, and return 18.9 million shares of Theranos stock. She also isn\u2019t allowed to be the director or officer of a publicly traded company for 10 years.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nDespite the charges, Holmes has been allowed to stay on as CEO of Theranos, as it\u2019s a private company, not public. But the company is hanging on by a thread, and Holmes has written to investors asking for more money to save Theranos. \u201cIn light of where we are, this is no easy ask,\u201d Holmes wrote.\n\nsource Kimberly White/Getty Images for Fortune\n\nSource: Business Insider Maya Kosoff contributed to an earlier version of this story.", "description": "Business Insider - Elizabeth Holmes started Theranos at age 19 and became the world's youngest female billionaire.
