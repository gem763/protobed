The two companies announced that Marvel Studios and its president, Kevin Feige, will continue to produce the Spider-Man: Homecoming series. That means innocent bystanders Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Marisa Tomei will be back for a third Spider-Man, set for release on July 16, 2021, according to statements obtained by Variety. Tom Holland\u2019s Spider-Man is also set to make an appearance in a separate Marvel film. In August of this year, reports that Disney and Sony were unable to reach an agreement regarding financing led to the rumor that Disney would pull its producing team, including Feige. Disney was out for a 50/50 financing deal, whereas Sony wanted to keep the original deal, where Disney receives 5 percent of first-dollar gross and all of the merchandising profits. \u201cI am thrilled that Spidey\u2019s journey in the MCU will continue, and I and all of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working on it,\u201d said Feige in a statement. \u201cSpider-Man is a powerful icon and hero whose story crosses all ages and audiences around the globe. He also happens to be the only hero with the superpower to cross cinematic universes, so as Sony continues to develop their own Spidey-verse you never know what surprises the future might hold.\u201d", "description": "Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures have reached an agreement regarding Spider-Man\u2019s future in the MCU.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/27/27-spiderman-homecoming.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
