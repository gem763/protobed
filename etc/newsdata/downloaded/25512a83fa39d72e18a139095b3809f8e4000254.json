It did not give any details.\n\nAccording to Zimbabwean laws a suspect must appear in court within 48 hours after his or her arrest.\n\nMupfumira, a senior member of the ruling ZANU-PF party, was previously labour minister who oversaw the $1bn state pension fund. She was fired by ex-president Robert Mugabe weeks before a military-led coup that toppled him in November 2017.\n\nShe was reappointed after Mugabe's overthrow and given a new portfolio.\n\nIn an audit report in June, the ZACC has accused several high profile officials of abuse of funds, according to local media a total of $82m. The scandal has been labelled as the \"National Social Security Authority Scandal\".\n\nThe anti-corruption commission was given the power to arrest suspects, but critics question whether it will be effective.\n\nThe opposition cast doubt on Mnangagwa's decision to appoint High Court Judge Loice Matanda-Moyo as the commission's chair, alleging a potential conflict of interest because she is married to Foreign Affairs Minister Sibusiso Moyo, the retired army general who announced the coup against Mugabe.\n\nAdditional reporting by Chris Muronzi in Harare.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android or iPhone.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Prisca Mupfumira is the first senior government official to be held by anti-graft body since it's overhaul on July 15.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9084/77fc72c1e4b448cea27782cf65b149b6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-26"}
