It was very interesting to find out what they really were.\"\n\n\"Finding the murals is the best thing, really,\" she continued. \"The residents find it fascinating as well.\"\n\nWorkers at the home believe it may have been used as a gentlemen's lounge and British historian Anthony Beeson said the work is \"certainly\" from American soldiers.\n\n\"Several of the large houses in the area... were requisitioned for troops,\" Beeson told the BBC. \"Note that the bottle has 'rye' written on it which no Englishman would do. I suspect it was their mess-room or the like.\"\n\nNAZI SOLDIERS USED PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING 'SUPER-DRUG' IN WORLD WAR II, SHOCKING DOCUMENTARY REVEALS\n\nA second painting was discovered in the room, appearing to show musical notes and a dog holding a bone, which Beeson believes may reference the English children's song, \"This Old Man.\"\n\n\"The bulldog probably refers to the song 'Knick Knack paddywack...give a dog a bone, this old man came rolling home', which would be very appropriate for a bar and also account for the notes,\" Beeson added.\n\nThe facility is going to paint over the murals in order to get ready for the next resident, but Mazur-Kruszynska added a plasterboard will be put over them so they can be preserved.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Workers renovating\u00a0a room for a new resident at a nursing home discovered racy paintings dating back to World War II\u00a0beneath the wallpaper.", "authors": ["Chris Ciaccia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/world-war-2-painting-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
