We protect borders of other countries, but we don\u2019t protect our own borders. But I want to thank Mexico \u2026 27,000 Mexican soldiers are on our border and you see the numbers, they plummeted \u2026 all because the Democrats wouldn\u2019t approve simple changes to what we call the loopholes.\n\n\u201cSo Mexico has helped us more at our border than the Democrats,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHonestly, they\u2019re terrible.\u201d\n\nTrump said it is no wonder that foreign nationals flood the nation\u2019s border when every leading 2020 Democrat \u2014 including Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) \u2014 has promised to provide free, taxpayer-funded healthcare to all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens, a program that would cost anywhere between $23 to $66 billion every year.\n\nTrump said\u201d\n\nAnd then you wonder why they come to America. Why wouldn\u2019t they come? Free healthcare, free education, free everything \u2026 the Democrat vision of America is to rob American taxpayers to fund socialism for the entire world. If you don\u2019t want Democrats to raid your healthcare, steal your money, overcrowd your schools, and overwhelm your communities, then you have only one choice, you have to go out tomorrow, vote Republican. Get John Bel Edwards the hell out of office.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, Trump has negotiated deals with Mexico to increase border controls on the Mexican side of the border to stop illegal aliens from crossing into the U.S. The most notable is Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy that ends the process by which border crossers are released into the interior of the country and instead returned to Mexico, preventing mass asylum fraud.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
