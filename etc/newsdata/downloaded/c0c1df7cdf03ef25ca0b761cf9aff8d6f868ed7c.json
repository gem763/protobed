Donald Trump's least presidential moments so far... 1/29 Flippantly dismissing a serious allegation of sexual assault When author E Jean Carroll accused Trump of raping her, the president responded: \u201cNumber one, she\u2019s not my type. Number two, it never happened. It never happened, OK?\" AFP/Getty 2/29 Insulting the Mayor of London as he landed in London Just before touching down at Stansted Airport for his state visit, Trump took time out to @ the London mayor Saduq Khan on twitter. He said that Khan has done a \"terrible job\"as mayor and that he is a \"stone cold loser\" Reuters 3/29 Taking plenty of \"Executive Time\" The President's official schedule sets aside the hours from 8 to 11am daily for \"Executive Time\". Further intermittent periods of \"Executive Time\" are scheduled throughout any given day, ranging from 15 minutes to 3 hours. His duties in these hours have not been officially disclosed, though Axios reports that he spends them watching TV, reading the newspapers and tweeting Getty 4/29 Shutdown the government for over a month in an effort to secure funding for his wall With Mexico declining to pay for the wall, the President has faced difficulty in raising the required $5 billion at home. Due to his demand that the money for the wall be included in the budget, and congress' refusal, the government partially shut down on 22 December 2018. It remained shut for over a month, the longest period in history Getty 5/29 Joking about the Nazi occupation of France to President Macron In this tweet on November 13, the President mocks Emmanuel Macron's suggestion of a \"true, European army\" by invoking the conflict between France and Germany in the world wars 6/29 Railing against the Mueller investigation The President has repeatedly claimed that the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, is a \"rigged witch hunt\" Reuters 7/29 Contradicting a US intelligence report on Russian meddling in the presence of Vladimir Putin In the press conference that followed his landmark meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr. Trump stated that he saw no reason why Russia would have meddled in the 2016 US election. This contradicted a 2017 report by the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence that found evidence of Russian interference in favour of Mr. Trump Getty 8/29 Contradicting his contradiction of a US intelligence report on Russian meddling Following furious backlash in the US, the President claimed that he meant to say that he saw no reason why it wouldn't have been Russia who meddled in the 2016 US election. As to why he would have intended to use such bizarre phrasing, he did not comment Reuters 9/29 Colouring in the US flag wrong The President coloured in the US flag wrongly during a visit to a children's hospital in Columbus, Ohio. He added a blue stripe where in tradition, and statute, there have been only white and red stripes AFP/Getty 10/29 Firing a Secretary of State over Twitter The President announced on Twitter that he was appointing Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, much to the surprise of then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson 11/29 Quoting a catchphrase from a reality TV show when discussing police brutality While addressing the issue of black athletes not standing for the national anthem in protest of police brutality, the President made reference to his catchphrase from reality TV show \"The Apprentice\": you're fired! Reuters 12/29 Calling African nations \"S***hole Countries\" Ever one for diplomacy, the President reportedly referred to African nations as \"s***hole countries\". Asked to confirm this when meeting with Nigeria's President Buhari, Mr. Trump stated that there are \"some countries that are in very bad shape.\" Reuters 13/29 Defending Russian President Vladimir Putin Donald Trump appeared to equate US foreign actions to those of Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying, \u201cThere are a lot of killers. You think our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d Reuters 14/29 Asking for people to 'pray' for Arnold Schwarzenegger At the National Prayer Breakfast, Donald Trump couldn\u2019t help but to ask for prayers for the ratings on Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s show to be good. Schwarzenegger took over as host of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d \u2014 which buoyed Mr Trump\u2019s celebrity status years ago Getty 15/29 Hanging up on Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull Early in his presidency, Donald Trump reportedly hung up the phone on Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after the foreign leader angered him over refugee plans. Mr Trump later said that it was the \u201cworst call\u201d he had had so far Getty 16/29 The 'Muslim ban' Perhaps one of his most controversial policies while acting as president, Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries has bought him a lot of criticism. The bans were immediately protested, and judges initially blocked their implementation. The Supreme Court later sided with the administration\u2019s argument that the ban was developed out of concern for US security Getty 17/29 Praising crowd size while touring Hurricane Harvey damage After Hurricane Harvey ravaged southeastern Texas, Donald Trump paid the area a visit. While his response to the disaster in Houston was generally applauded, the President picked up some flack when he gave a speech outside Houston (he reportedly did not visit disaster zones), and praised the size of the crowds there AP 18/29 Calling North Korean leader Kim Jong-un 'Little Rocket Man' During his first-ever speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Donald Trump tried out a new nickname for North Korea leader Kim Jong-un: Rocket Man. He later tweaked it to be \u201clittle Rocket Man\u201d as the two feuded, and threatened each other with nuclear war. During that speech, he also threatened to totally annihilate North Korea 19/29 Attacking Sadiq Khan following London Bridge terror attack After the attack on the London Bridge, Donald Trump lashed out at London Mayor Sadiq Khan, criticizing Mr Khan for saying there was \u201cno reason to be alarmed\u201d after the attack. Mr Trump was taking the comments out of context, as Mr Khan was simply saying that the police had everything under control Getty 20/29 Claiming presenter Mika Brezinkski was 'bleeding from the face' Never one not to mock his enemies, Donald Trump mocked MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d co-host Mika Brzezinski, saying that she and co-host Joe Scarborough had approached him before his inauguration asking to \u201cjoin\u201d him. He noted that she was \u201cbleeding badly from a face-lift\u201d at the time, and that he said no MSNBC 21/29 Claiming the blame for Charlottesville was on 'both sides' Trump refused to condemn far-right extremists involved in violence at 'the march for the right' protests in Charlottesville, even after the murder of counter protester Heather Heyer AP 22/29 Retweeting cartoon of CNN being hit by a 'Trump train' Donald Trump retweeted a cartoon showing a Trump-branded train running over a person whose body and head were replaced by a CNN avatar. He later deleted the retweet 23/29 Tweeting about 'slamming' CNN Donald Trump caught some flack when he tweeted a video showing him wrestling down an individual whose head had been replaced by a CNN avatar. Mr Trump has singled CNN out in particular with his chants of \u201cfake news\u201d 24/29 Firing head of the FBI, James Comey Donald Trump\u2019s firing of former FBI Director James Comey landed him with a federal investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election that has caused many a headache for the White House. The White House initially said that the decision was made after consultation from the Justice Department. Then Mr Trump himself said that he had decided to fire him in part because he wanted the Russia investigation Mr Comey was conducting to stop Getty 25/29 Not realising being president would be 'hard' Just three months into his presidency, Donald Trump admitted that being president is harder than he thought it would be. Though Mr Trump insisted on the 2016 campaign trail that doing the job would be easy for him, he admitted in an interview that living in the White House is harder than running a business empire Reuters 26/29 Accusing Obama of wiretapping him Donald Trump accused former President Barack Obama of wire tapping him on twitter. The Justice Department later clarified: Mr Obama had not, in fact, done so Reuters 27/29 Claiming there had been 3 million 'illegal votes' Donald Trump was never very happy about losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by 2.8 million ballots. So, he and White House voter-fraud commissioner Kris Kobach have claimed that anywhere between three and five million people voted illegally during the 2016 election. Conveniently, he says that all of those illegal votes went to Ms Clinton. (There is no evidence to support that level of widespread voter fraud.) 28/29 Leaving Jews out of the Holocaust memorial statement Just days after taking office, Donald Trump\u2019s White House issued a statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, but didn\u2019t mention \u201cjews\u201d or even the word \u201cjewish\u201d in the written statement Getty 29/29 Anger over Inauguration crowd size Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd was visibly, and noticeably, smaller than that of his predecessor, Barack Obama. But, he really wanted to have had the largest crowd on record. So, he praised it as the biggest crowd ever. Relatedly, Mr Trump also claimed that it stopped raining in Washington at the moment he was inaugurated. It didn\u2019t, the day was very dreary Reuters 1/29 Flippantly dismissing a serious allegation of sexual assault When author E Jean Carroll accused Trump of raping her, the president responded: \u201cNumber one, she\u2019s not my type.

Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out. Illegal?\u201d\n\nHe also suggested that he had studied the results on a search for \u201cTrump news\u201d and concluded that almost all were \u201cleft-wing\u201d. It is not clear where that figure came from, and it does not appear to match up with what appears on that results page at the moment.\n\n\u201c96 per cent of results on \u2018Trump News\u2019 are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous,\u201d he continued. \u201cGoogle & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation \u2013 will be addressed!\u201d\n\nThe search results that appear on any Google page are decided by an algorithm that brings in a whole host of factors, many of which remain known only to Google itself. Results are also influenced by previous browsing and search history, and that may be happening to the president.\n\nThe company has looked to alter some of the ways it decides what to show in the wake of complaints about false news, and suggestions that the search results were showing partisan or misleading news sources.\n\nGoogle is yet to comment on the president\u2019s allegations.\n\nAt the moment, searching for \u201cTrump news\u201d brings up stories from a wide-range of sources. They include positive stories from the BBC and Fox News, as well as more critical pieces from CNN.\n\nMr Trump sent the post at 5.30am local time, apparently after having searched his own name. He is known to be continually interested in coverage of himself.\n\nThe president and those around him have launched a number of attacks on both Google and other tech companies in recent weeks. Many firms such as Apple and Facebook have opted to remove far-right voices such as Alex Jones from their platforms, which has led to criticism from Mr Trump.\n\nLast month, he wrote a long rant on Twitter about how he claimed right-wing voices were being shut down on the platform.\n\n\u201cSocial Media is totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSpeaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration, we won\u2019t let that happen. They are closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT, while at the same time doing nothing to others.......\n\n\u201c.....Censorship is a very dangerous thing & absolutely impossible to police. If you are weeding out Fake News, there is nothing so Fake as CNN & MSNBC, & yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed. I get used to it and watch with a grain of salt, or don\u2019t watch at all..\n\n\u201c....Too many voices are being destroyed, some good & some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen. Who is making the choices, because I can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made. Let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump has accused Google of rigging its search results to make him look bad.
