After moving toward the islands over the weekend, it came to a halt on Monday evening above them. The hurricane moved just 14 miles from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m, and sat about 105 miles off the coast of Florida.\n\nThe storm was expected to continue drubbing the islands \u2014 which have a combined population of about 77,000, the majority of whom live on Grand Bahama \u2014 through Monday night, forecasters said, before resuming its course toward the Atlantic coast and turning up the coast.\n\n\u201cTonight and tomorrow morning, we\u2019ll start to see the pull to the north that we\u2019ve all been anxiously awaiting, because we really need to get this thing off of the Bahamas and moving northward,\u201d Ken Graham, the director of the National Hurricane Center, said in a Facebook video.", "description": "The Category 4 storm came to a standstill as it pummeled the Bahamas.
