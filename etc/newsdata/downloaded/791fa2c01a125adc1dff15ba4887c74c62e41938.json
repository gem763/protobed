Franchot provided the second vote Hogan needed on the state\u2019s three-member Board of Public Works to move the plan forward over the objections of political leaders in Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut since that approval, even advocates for the overall plan have begun to voice concerns that widening I-270 first, while politically expedient for the governor, will not alleviate traffic \u2014 and will probably make it worse.\n\nWidening I-270 without first widening the Beltway and expanding the bridge will dump more vehicles into the Beltway\u2019s same smaller funnel, adding to the notorious backups on both highways, traffic watchers say.\n\n\u201cYes, you\u2019re going to make it worse,\u201d said John Townsend, spokesman for AAA Mid-Atlantic, which supported Hogan\u2019s initial toll lane plan.\n\nTownsend said it was \u201cpolitically practical\u201d to start with the least controversial segment. Even so, he said, when he heard about the change to widen I-270 before the Beltway and bridge, \u201cI said, \u2018Oh, my God, they\u2019ll rue the day that that scenario ever unfolds.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdditionally, many say the state\u2019s plan to focus first on the lower section of I-270, between the Beltway and Interstate 370, would not fix the highway\u2019s worst northbound chokepoint where traffic grinds to a halt as six lanes narrow down to two. State officials have said the lower section would be more lucrative for the companies that will build the lanes and collect the tolls.\n\nToll lane supporters say putting off the bridge expansion also delays an opportunity to begin creating a regional toll lane network by extending the toll lanes on Virginia\u2019s portion of the Beltway across the bridge and into Maryland.\n\nState Sen. Nancy J. King (D-Montgomery), who represents the upcounty and supports adding toll lanes to I-270, said she hears from exasperated motorists that the state\u2019s plan makes no sense.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey might not have thought it through,\u201d King said of Hogan and state transportation officials. \u201cThey might have thought widening 270 would solve the problem, but if you don\u2019t fix the American Legion Bridge and the spur [at the Beltway], people will always be stuck there.\u201d\n\nPlan complications\n\nHogan spokesman Michael \u00adRicci declined to respond to questions about the potential traffic impacts of widening I-270 first. He referred to Hogan\u2019s comments during the June Board of Public Works meeting in which the governor said starting with I-270 would allow another couple of years for the \u201chundreds of thousands of commuters who sit in that [Beltway] traffic to convince their local leaders that they desperately want\u201d relief.\n\nAD\n\nErin Henson, spokeswoman for the Maryland Department of Transportation, referred all questions to the governor\u2019s office.\n\nAD\n\nHogan\u2019s plan, which is undergoing a federally required environmental review, would add up to four toll lanes to both I-270 and the Capital Beltway. Tolls would fluctuate with traffic to keep the lanes flowing. The existing lanes, which also would be rebuilt, would remain free.\n\nWhether the plan makes traffic better or worse, even temporarily, could determine whether any new lanes are built. The project would be done via public-private partnerships in which teams of companies would build and finance the lanes\u2019 construction in exchange for keeping most of the toll revenue long-term. The overall construction is valued at more than $11 billion.\n\nAD\n\nHowever, experts say the consortia could have trouble securing financing if the toll profits become less certain, such as if investors believe fewer motorists would pay tolls to avoid traffic only to hit another backup.\n\nAD\n\nThe potential impacts of Maryland\u2019s change are already complicating congestion relief efforts in Northern Virginia.\n\nSeven months after Hogan released his initial proposal in 2017, the Virginia Department of Transportation announced a plan to extend its Beltway toll lanes to the American Legion Bridge. Those efforts, Virginia officials noted, would be \u201cclosely coordinated and compatible with\u201d Maryland\u2019s plan to widen its part of the Beltway and the bridge, which Maryland owns.\n\nAD\n\nBut without a wider bridge, Virginia will end up moving its bottleneck three miles closer to the Maryland line, said Susan Shaw, VDOT\u2019s megaprojects director.\n\nShaw said VDOT still plans to extend its toll lanes, but it has begun analyzing how a delay in the bridge\u2019s widening would affect traffic on the Virginia side of the Beltway.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s preferable to us to have Maryland attack the American Legion Bridge as soon as it practically can, because it\u2019s the most congested interstate segment in the Washington region,\u201d Shaw said.\n\nOptimal phasing\n\nPublic officials in Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s had primarily objected to widening the Beltway east of I-270, where the right of way is the most narrow and a state study found that up to 34 homes and parts of hundreds of backyards might have to be condemned. Local opponents said the plan also didn\u2019t do enough to expand transit and would destroy environmentally sensitive parkland.\n\nAD\n\nHowever, Montgomery leaders also had said that both I-270 and the western part of the Beltway had more room to add lanes without taking homes.\n\n\u201cWe were pleased when [the state] began looking at doing I-270 first,\u201d said Chris Conklin, deputy director of Montgomery\u2019s transportation department. \u201cBut we were very surprised they hadn\u2019t included the section [of the Beltway] to the American Legion Bridge. It had never been a thought that they\u2019d leave that piece out.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFranchot\u2019s office declined to answer questions about his vote. A spokeswoman referred questions about the potential traffic effects of the I-270 decision to state transportation planners.\n\nAD\n\nState Treasurer Nancy K. Kopp (D), the third member of the Board of Public Works, voted against the project after asking Hogan why the bridge and western Beltway would not be part of the first phase. Hogan said breaking up the Beltway segments between the bridge and Interstate 95 \u201cwould require going back and reinventing the process,\u201d according to a transcript of the meeting.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t as concerned about controversy as I was about whether it made sense for improving traffic,\u201d Kopp said in an interview. \u201cI just don\u2019t see how they see it working out on the ground.\u201d\n\nKopp, who is elected by the General Assembly, said her office has since asked Maryland transportation officials to clarify how widening I-270 first will not worsen backups at the Beltway, but she hasn\u2019t received any answers.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey say \u2018We\u2019re still working on it,\u2019 \u201d Kopp said.\n\nSome supporters of Hogan\u2019s plan say the order of the highway expansion is less important than getting at least part of it underway.\n\n\u201cWhatever we can do to get the project started should be done,\u201d said Emmet Tydings, whose group, Citizens For Traffic Relief, backs the toll project. \u201cI don\u2019t think [expanding lower I-270 first] is optimal phasing, but we say don\u2019t let perfect be the enemy of good. My hope would be that phasing will change somehow.\u201d\n\nBob Buchanan, a commercial real estate developer and president of the 2030 Group, a regional business organization that supports the overall toll lane plan, said he commends Hogan for trying to provide \u201cdesperately needed\u201d infrastructure improvements. However, he said, state and local leaders need to negotiate the most efficient way to stage construction to help motorists.", "description": "Even supporters of Gov.
