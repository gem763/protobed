As the first half of the show\u2019s sixth and final season begins, BoJack is still haunted by his role in the death of Sarah Lynn; her name is the episode\u2019s first line of dialogue, and the memory of the night sky in the planetarium on the night she died is the last thing BoJack thinks about as he reenters rehab at episode\u2019s end.\n\nBut as much as Sarah Lynn\u2019s death haunts the episode (and the series), the final season also kicks off with some new and hopeful signs that BoJack\u2019s self-destructive, self-flagellating pattern might finally be breaking. The premiere episode features a new version of BoJack Horseman\u2019s familiar opening title sequence \u2014 which invariably depicts BoJack in a drunken haze, in what has begun to feel like a grim joke on the repetitive, purgatorial nature of his day-to-day life. But this time, the title sequence dissolves and fades away long before it reaches the part where BoJack ends up slugging down a whiskey and passing out into his own swimming pool. Maybe this time, the episode implies, the cycle can be broken.\n\nSo: Can it? Can anyone \u2014 let alone someone like BoJack, who has inflicted so much pain on himself and others \u2014 actually turn their life around? Even if that doesn\u2019t turn out to be the question that defines BoJack Horseman\u2019s entire final season, it\u2019s certainly the question at the center of \u201cA Horse Walks Into a Rehab,\u201d which focuses almost solely on BoJack. (When Diane, Todd, Princess Carolyn, and Mr. Peanutbutter show up in a five-way phone call, it\u2019s for a comedic detour that has absolutely no bearing on this episode\u2019s plot.)\n\nWe pick up where we left off at the end of season five, with BoJack voluntarily checking into Pastiches, a rehabilitation center in Malibu. Despite balking at the $100,000 price tag \u2014 \u201cDoes every room come with a free bag of $90,000?\u201d \u2014 he follows through on his commitment. A quick montage sums up BoJack\u2019s new life in rehab: a full regimen of diverse therapies that he resists with both humor and typical acid-tongued skepticism. But despite his worst impulses, it\u2019s also clear that at least some of his therapy is sinking in.\n\nSomewhat paradoxically, BoJack shows the most growth when he flees rehab alongside a fellow patient named Jamison. Jamison is at least two decades younger than BoJack, but she\u2019s repeatedly been pushed into rehab at her father\u2019s insistence, a fate she endures by smuggling bottles of vodka inside the facility\u2019s walls. When Jamison leaves to confront her cheating boyfriend, BoJack tags along, trying to steer her away from alcohol and back into rehab.\n\nThis is the point at which those with a long memory for BoJack Horseman might get nervous. BoJack\u2019s paternal relationship with Jamison bears a striking resemblance to his relationship with Sarah Lynn, who also did a rehab stint in Pastiches. In that case, BoJack repeatedly pushed her off the wagon, exploited her trust by sleeping with her, started the bender that led to her death, and \u2014 we learn this episode \u2014 lied about his role in it, painting himself as the sober-minded adult who tried to save her. (If BoJack Horseman is earnestly setting up a redemptive arc for BoJack, I suspect we\u2019ll see that lie exposed before the season is over.)\n\nIn the case of Jamison, however, BoJack manages to help Jamison stay on course while resisting his own temptation to relapse. When they eventually end up at Jamison\u2019s father\u2019s house, he learns that the \u201clittle sibling\u201d Jamison despises is actually her own baby, and that the father Jamison rants about is lovingly, earnestly committed to helping her turn her life around. And when Jamison\u2019s father drives them both back to rehab, BoJack refuses to let Jamison enter with her contraband vodka, doing his best to make sure her treatment sticks this time.\n\nIt\u2019s a path he can understand, because this episode also offers a few grim examples of the moments when alcohol became a fixture of the young BoJack\u2019s life. There was his first onscreen kiss with supermodel Cindy Crawfish in Horsin\u2019 Around, when a P.A. gave him a screwdriver to calm his nerves. There was a party in high school, where the nerdy BoJack chugged beer in an attempt to look cool and realized he could get laughs by mocking the people around him. There was a moment as an adolescent, when he caught his father cheating with a personal assistant and his father pushed alcohol on him to make him forget. And there was a moment when he was only a toddler, discovering his parents both passed-out drunk after a party, when he waddled up to a bottle of vodka and took a sip.\n\nIn therapy, BoJack rejects the idea that his addiction isn\u2019t his own fault: \u201cI\u2019m here because I made choices. Nobody made me drink.\u201d And while it\u2019s clearly important for BoJack to take responsibility for his actions, recalling the actual context in which he made those actions might help him to understand the roots of his alcoholism \u2014 and then put an end to it for good. If there\u2019s a hope for BoJack\u2019s future in \u201cA Horse Walks Into a Rehab,\u201d it\u2019s that his desire to break out of this cycle is finally, actually, genuinely there. For the first time in a while, the despair is counterbalanced by both the hope for change and the will to change.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t always been the case. Early in the episode, Dr. Champ says to BoJack: \u201cYou can leave whenever you like. But is that really what you want?\u201d He\u2019s talking about rehab, but the darker implication of \u201cleave whenever you like\u201d has haunted BoJack for the entire series.\n\nFor one episode, at least, BoJack is earnestly committed to making a go of it. He checks himself back into the clinic and returns to his room to start six weeks of rehab all over again, without any shortcuts. Yes, there\u2019s still a bottle of vodka sitting on his nightstand \u2014 but for now, he\u2019s not drinking it.\n\nHorsin\u2019 Around\n\n\u2022 BoJack has repurposed his inconspicuous \u201cSPY SHIT\u201d bag as a similarly inconspicuous \u201cREHAB SHIT\u201d bag.\n\n\u2022 In the latest of BoJack Horseman\u2019s impressive lineup of celebrities mocking themselves, Jeanne Tripplehorn voices \u201cJoan Tripplehorn,\u201d who is clearly just Jeanne Tripplehorn going to rehab under a fake name.\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s also Jay Hernandez, voicing himself as a method actor doing undercover research to play a pill-popping Mario in Zack Snyder\u2019s Super Mario Bros. \u2014 which, yeah, I\u2019d watch that.\n\n\u2022 The treatment regimen at the Pastiches Malibu rehab clinic includes Group Therapy, Sleep Therapy, Hike Therapy (which takes patients up Metaphor Mountain), Art Therapy, Visiting Therapy, Plant Therapy, Yoga Therapy, and Horse Therapy (which, at least in BoJack\u2019s case, means talking to another horse).\n\n\u2022 A list of the movie props in Jamison\u2019s dad\u2019s house: The car from Ferris Bueller, the baseball bat from The Natural, the carpet from The Shining, the baby carriage from The Untouchables, the hammer from Thor, the idol from Raiders of the Lost Ark, the giant window from The Graduate, and the club from The First Wives Club (which is, you know, an actual club). He also drives the car from 1994\u2019s immortal cinema classic, The Flintstones.\n\n\u2022 A list of the BoJack-ified movie posters in the episode: Citizen Crane, Alpacalypse Now, and 2 Cats 2 Curious.\n\n\u2022 Words of wisdom from Dr. Champ: \u201cWe want what our addictions want us to want \u2014 in the same way that our future is just a house built from the materials of our present on the blueprint that is our past.\u201d\n\n\u2022 And an all-time tongue-twister perfectly delivered by Amy Sedaris, which I\u2019ve painstakingly transcribed so you can try it for yourself: \u201cWait: You\u2019re telling me your dumb drone downed a tower and drowned Downtown Julie Brown\u2019s dummy drum-y dum-dum-dum-dum, dousing her newly-found goose-down hand-me-down gown?\u201d", "description": "The final season kicks off with some new and hopeful signs that BoJack\u2019s patterns of self-destruction may finally be breaking.
