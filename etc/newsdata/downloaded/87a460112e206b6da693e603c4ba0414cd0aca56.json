Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.'\n\nPrince Andrew said of Epstein: 'At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.'\n\nThe documentary also unearthed claims that Epstein had '13 contact numbers for Prince Andrew' in an address book.\n\nDiscovered at his mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, the address book was found to have contact details for several of the Duke of York's residences, including Buckingham Palace.\n\nPrince Andrew has previously denied being aware of any of Epstein's illegal activities. He is pictured above in 2010 answering the door of Epstein's New York mansion\n\nBritish socialite Lady Victoria Hervey told Dispatches that Epstein, who killed himself in prison, was 'addicted to collecting people' such as the royal.\n\n'Andrew was kind of like newly single... And he meets this charismatic man \u2013 Jeffrey collected people. He was almost addicted to collecting important people.\n\n'He liked to impress people. So, the British Royal Family, can you imagine? This was his biggest kind of trophy.'\n\nAn investigator has said it was 'hogwash' that Prince Andrew (left) didn't know about Jeffrey Epstein's (right) behaviour. The pair were pictured together in 2010\n\nAndrew says he first met Epstein in 1999, around the same time he had a brief romance with Lady Victoria.\n\nAn unnamed friend of Epstein told the programme the prince's friendship with the American after his 2009 conviction for having sex with underage girls was 'more than a lack of judgment' and showed hubris.\n\nThe friend added: 'You begin to believe you can't be damaged. You're beyond being damaged. The little people out there can't touch you.'\n\nHe said he warned Epstein against having the prince visit him in New York in 2010 following his spell in prison for sex offences. He claims he told Epstein: 'They will attack Prince Andrew for being your friend, and each of you will lose... And I remember him saying: 'No one will know'.'\n\nThe warnings proved correct and the pair were photographed together in Central Park. Andrew admits he knew Epstein for 12 years but has strongly denied any inappropriate behaviour with underage girls.\n\nDai Davis, who was in charge of royal protection for the Metropolitan Police in the 1990s, said he was 'mystified' as to why Scotland Yard did not investigate.\n\nEpstein hanged himself in August in prison in New York while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges.", "description": "According Channel 4's Dispatches programme, Ms Roberts was brought to London by Epstein in 2001, when she was 17, and met the Prince at a house in Belgravia.", "authors": ["Ed Riley", "Richard Spillett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/10/20028688-0-image-a-28_1571737033881.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
