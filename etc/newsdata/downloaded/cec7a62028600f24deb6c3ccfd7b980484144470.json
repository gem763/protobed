A clown-for-hire by day, he aspires to be a stand-up comic at night\u2026 but finds the joke always seems to be on him. Caught in a cyclical existence between apathy and cruelty, Arthur makes one bad decision that brings about a chain reaction of escalating events in this gritty character study.\u201d\n\nWhy so... serious?\n\nArthur isn\u2019t the only one putting on a clown mask, though. The trailer also shows a Gotham City full of rioting clowns, possibly as a thematic stand-in for something like the disaffected-with-society Anonymous movement in the real world.\n\nIt\u2019s heavy stuff, and it promises a far more serious take on the Joker\u2019s traditional comics supervillainy than the already fairly grounded approach seen in 2008\u2019s The Dark Knight.\n\nThe trailer also gives us a look at Bruce Wayne\u2019s father, Thomas (Brett Cullen). In most Batman stories, the death of Thomas and his wife Martha is the defining incident that leads Bruce to take up the cowl and fight crime as a masked vigilante. Thomas is very much alive here, though, which means Joker likely won\u2019t feature a showdown between its titular character and the Caped Crusader. Although it\u2019s possible the film could offer yet another take on the Wayne parents\u2019 much-portrayed deaths in Crime Alley.\n\nDC and Warner Bros. seem to be taking care to distance this portrayal of the character from its other iterations, noting that Joker is \u201can original, standalone fictional story not seen before on the big screen.\u201d We\u2019ll find out if all of these big ideas work as a movie when Joker hits theaters on October 4th.", "description": "The final trailer for Todd Phillips\u2019 Joker has arrived, and it reveals the gritty, dark take on the iconic Batman villain played by Joaquin Phoenix.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8K9t8k5NBrelUo3G6T0z7Z86jw=/39x0:2442x1258/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19126064/Screen_Shot_2019_08_28_at_12.48.02_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-08-28"}
