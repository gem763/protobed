(532648.BY) slumped to its lowest closing level in a decade on Tuesday, prompting query from the Bombay Stock Exchange.\n\nThe shares closed down 22.8% at 32 Indian Rupees ($0.45) on the Bombay Stock Exchange, hitting the lowest level since Aug. 20, 2009.\n\n\"The exchange has sought clarification from Yes Bank Ltd. on Oct. 1, 2019, with reference to movement in price,\" the BSE said. \"The reply is awaited.\"\n\nThe share plummeted as the lender's founder and related entities sold further stake in the company, exacerbating worries of investors who are already concerned with the bank's exposure to some weak non-banking financial names.\n\nYes Capital (India) Pvt Ltd, the bank's founder Rana Kapoor, along with Morgan Credits Pvt Ltd, together sold shares totaling 2.16% in open market on Sept. 26-27. This was in addition to the founder and related entities recently selling a combined 2.75% stake in the bank to raise funds and cut debt.\n\nWrite to Saurabh Chaturvedi at saurabh.chaturvedi@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 01, 2019 07:36 ET (11:36 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
