We all remember that during the festival of Pongal, a Test match used to happen in Chennai. And the start of the season used to be in Delhi.\n\n\"Bangalore would have a Test match, Mumbai would have a Test match, Kolkata of course.\n\n\"I think it is important for Test cricket to promote these centres where people would know that these are the centres where you are going to play Test match cricket prior to the start of the season, so that you can market Test cricket and you can make sure that the crowds come in.\n\n\"When I was the coach, I think we played in six different centres.\n\n\"They were all new centres and the one centre it was packed was Indore. The atmosphere was brilliant.\n\n\"It (the stadium in Indore) is in the heart of the city. That was one of the reasons that the crowd could come in irrespective of the time of the day.\"\n\nIndia will host Bangladesh for three T20Is and two matches next month with games in the longest format set to be played in Indore and Kolkata.\n\n- TeamTalk Media", "description": "Former India coach Anil Kumble has backed current captain Virat Kohli's proposal for them to have limited Test venues in their home season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1898/75da7213ab404ee2a195c05ca6cd0966.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
