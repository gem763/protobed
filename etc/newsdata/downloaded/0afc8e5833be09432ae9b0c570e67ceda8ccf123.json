I think all of the Champions League games are as big as this,\" Van Dijk told Sky Sports.\n\n\"The whole atmosphere and leading to the actual game is bigger than some other games but I don't think it's the biggest of the season.\n\n\"The big ones are the Champions League and the ones that are hopefully going to win us the Premier League title.\"\n\n(Image: Leicester City FC via Getty Imag)\n\nUnited are the biggest price they have ever been for a home Premier League match with some bookmakers this weekend.\n\nAnd their task has been made harder with both Paul Pogba and David de Gea ruled out of the clash.\n\nVan Dijk added: \"They want to bounce back for all they've done this season and it's not what they've wanted so far, but we want to go out there and extend our points tally and keep winning.\n\n\"They're not in the best way, they're not fully confident and they're not in the situation they want to be in. But the good thing about football is you can bounce back in any game.\n\n\"They might think this is the best occasion to bounce back from it but we know that. We want to go out and fight for every metre on the pitch and try and take the three points back to Liverpool.\"", "description": "Liverpool head to Old Trafford at the top of the Premier League and 15 points clear of their fierce rivals", "authors": ["Liam Prenderville", "Image", "Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images", "Leicester City Fc Via Getty Imag"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20645677.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-Training-Session.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
