We have to work hard on technological sovereignty,\" Ursula von der Leyen, the Commission president-elect, told reporters on Tuesday. \"Margrethe Vestager will coordinate the whole agenda and be the commissioner for competition. She will work together with the internal market, innovation and youth, transport, health and justice.\"\n\nVestager's appointment sends a signal that the EU now wants to coordinate, or even merge, regulatory powers to bring previously distinct areas like competition and data protection under a single supervisor.\n\nAs Facebook moves into financial services with Libra, its digital currency, and Google branches out from search into hardware, the effort comes as part of worldwide push by agencies in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to figure out how to deal with tech companies that do not neatly fit into traditional categories of regulatory oversight established by policymakers.\n\nThe task of figuring out how to do that in the European Union now falls to Vestager.\n\nBut while she accumulates new powers, her expanded role also is an acknowledgment that the current system has failed.\n\nA small number digital giants remain the de facto digital gatekeepers for how Europeans and people around the world use online services. And despite years of investigations \u2014 many of them led by Vestager's own team \u2014 Google continues to dominate online search, Facebook remains the world's largest social network and Amazon continues to expand its online empire. Few, if any, have real global competitors.\n\nVestager will now have to limit such tech dominance while also pushing Europe to be at the forefront of digital regulation at a time when the United States and several countries in Asia are starting to review their approach to regulation with an eye to joining up industrial policy, competition and consumer protection.\n\n\"We have to update our regulation,\" said Jos\u00e9 van Dijck, a professor at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. \"We have compartmentalized our society within different legal frameworks. But that's not how these companies operate.\"\n\nExecutive vice president, Europe fit for the digital age\n\nEnter Vestager.\n\nUnder her new roles as both Commission executive vice president for digital and competition chief, she will have unprecedented power to direct how Europe tackles the dominance of Big Tech, promotes local players and sets rules for artificial intelligence and the use of big data.\n\nVestager will be tasked with making the region \"fit for the digital age,\" a wide-ranging responsibility that mirrors the current Commission's priority to bolster Europe's technological prowess \u2014 an area where the bloc falls behind China and the United States and where rivalries among member states have often made it difficult for Europe to speak with one voice.\n\n\"The stakes today are high,\" Vestager told an audience in Norway earlier this month. \"Like a footballer who gets to play in the World Cup for the first time, we find that the rules of the game are no different \u2014 but suddenly, the stakes are much higher.\"\n\nThe Commission's new tactics don't come without risks.\n\nVestager has been given new powers to tap into the EU's legions of bureaucrats in Brussels to both inform and set legislation. This access to her own staff and resources, including the bloc's powerful and well-resourced competition authority, means that Vestager will have more power to direct policy than vice presidents in the previous Commission.\n\n\"The task is to make a sufficiently strong team among commissioners to make sure we can make things happen.\" \u2014 Margrethe Vestager\n\nBut the Danish politician is also walking into a political minefield.\n\nAs she takes up new roles overseeing digital and industrial policy, she faces questions about possible conflicts of interest because she will both be enforcing and setting the EU's standards \u2014 a concern that she acknowledged. \"We cannot take any risks on the casework because it will have to stand up in court,\" Vestager said in response to questions about her independence.\n\nIn her new role, she will have to avoid overlapping with other commissioners, particularly Sylvie Goulard, the former deputy governor of France's central bank who was appointed as Europe's new internal markets commissioner with responsibility to promote digital industries.\n\nWith a remit to oversee regulation of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, Goulard will be in effect the region's digital commissioner with powers over new technologies like blockchain, data-hungry algorithms and the latest mobile networks, known as 5G. It remains to be seen exactly how the French official and Vestager will divide their respective responsibilities.\n\nVestager also is an outspoken critic of how tech companies use people's personal data \u2014 an area that she has made a priority for Europe's competition authority after opening several investigations in recent months into whether such harvesting of data by Silicon Valley represents an antitrust concern.\n\nBut this focus on data protection could bring her into conflict with national privacy watchdogs, many of which have their own ongoing investigations into Big Tech.\n\nIt may also put Vestager at loggerheads with Didier Reynders, a former Belgian politician, who was given oversight of Europe's tough privacy standards, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, within the incoming Commission.\n\n\"I have no intention of even trying to do the work on myself, on the contrary,\" Vestager told reporters on Tuesday. \"The task is to make a sufficiently strong team among commissioners to make sure we can make things happen.\"\n\nHow the Danish politician \u2014 one who has used selfies, popular culture references and high-profile interviews to boost her global profile \u2014 balances these competing, and often conflicting, interests will be key to whether she succeeds as the Commission's new vice president for digital.\n\nVestager was able to sidestep such challenges during her tenure as Europe's competition chief.\n\nNow the question is: Can she do it again?", "description": "The Danish politician returns to the Commission in an unprecedented role to direct and enforce European digital policy.", "authors": ["Mark Scott", "Thibault Larger", "Jakob Hanke"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1156222948-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
