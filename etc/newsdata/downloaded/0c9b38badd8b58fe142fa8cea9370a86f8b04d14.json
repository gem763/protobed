No doubt that the economic data announced on Friday, October 5th, 2019 look evident enough to extend bearish pressure over Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty; as it failed to cheer Indian equity market on Friday; and resulted in weekly closing in negative territory.\n\nNo doubt that the decision taken by the Monetary Policy Committee to cut rates by 25 basis points to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target limits, but the RBI\u2019s decision to revise its growth forecast up to 6.9%; looks evident enough to enhance the probabilities of further reduction in interest rates. I find that this may enhance volatility in Indian equity markets.\n\nFinally, I conclude that if the is not able to defend the level of 10,949 in a downward move, bears will remain in commanding position during the week. On the other hand, if the remains unable to defend the levels of 26,773, more sliding moves may be seen during the upcoming week.
