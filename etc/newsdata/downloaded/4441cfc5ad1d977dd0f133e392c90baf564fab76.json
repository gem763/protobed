The cease-fire\u2019s holding,\u201d Mr. Trump told a White House meeting of his Cabinet.\n\nMr. Trump is fending off criticism from both parties over his decision to withdraw dozens of troops from a Syrian buffer zone with Turkey. Lawmakers say it allowed Turkish forces to overrun American-allied Kurdish fighters, and that he added insult to injury by negotiating a cease-fire that allows Turkey to establish a safe zone while pushing out Kurds.\n\nResidents of a heavily Kurdish city in northeast Syria threw potatoes at withdrawing American troops on Monday, underscoring the deep anger over Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull most U.S. forces amid a Turkish military offensive.\n\nMr. Trump has compared the fight to two children in the lot fighting out old grievances. He said Turkey has taken casualties, too.\n\n\u201cPlenty of Turks have been killed because of conflict on their borders. You have to look at both ways,\u201d he told his Cabinet.\n\nHe said the U.S. \u201cnever made a commitment to the Kurds\u201d and that they\u2019ll \u201cwork something out so they have some money,\u201d hinting at a deal with oil companies or some other kind of \u201ccash flow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never agreed to protect the Kurds for the rest of their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to take a position. Let them fight themselves.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump says he withdrew troops to fulfill his campaign pledge of bringing troops home from foreign entanglements, yet the soldiers are being shuffled to new places.\n\nWhile Defense Secretary Mark Esper suggested Monday that a small U.S. force may stay behind to guard oil fields in the region, the bulk of the 1,000 American troops are now exiting Syria and heading to Iraq.\n\nRepublican leaders are fearful that a full withdrawal would allow Islamic State fighters to reclaim territory.\n\nMr. Trump said President Obama was to blame for the Islamic State\u2019s rise. He says he knows how to keep them in check.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one who did the capturing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the one who knows more about it than you people or the fake pundits.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Ben Wolfgang contributed to this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
