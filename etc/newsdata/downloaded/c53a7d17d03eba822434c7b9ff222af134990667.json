For plus-size globetrotters, that presents some challenges along the way, whether it\u2019s too-snug airplane seats or spa robes meant for someone of more diminutive stature. Take heart, though\u2014the problems are surmountable. Where there is a desire to take a journey, there are workable solutions to ensure grand experiences.\n\nHere are tips geared to fellow voyagers of size, gleaned from my own travels as a Rubenesque gal who has racked up visits to more than 70 countries.\n\nChoose your seat carefully\n\nIn the U.S., most airlines require that you be able to lower both armrests and buckle up your seatbelt (using one extender). That\u2019s the litmus test in determining whether you may be required to buy an adjacent (aka \u201ccomfort\u201d) seat. If you do need an additional \u201ccomfort\u201d seat, you\u2019ll need to call the airline directly to book them. Policies differ by airline and by country, so don\u2019t hesitate to talk to a customer service agent for clarification.\n\nThe standard width for a seat used to be 18 inches, but that number has been shrinking steadily as airlines attempt to maximize profitability, despite the fact the average weight for adults is increasing. Seat widths vary from aircraft to aircraft and by airline, so before you book, refer to SeatGuru to see the options on your flight. For example, Canada\u2019s Air Transat offers a width of just 16.5 inches, one of the smallest in the industry. Hawaiian, Delta, and Allegiant range between 16.8 and 17.5 inches.\n\nYou might want to get extra legroom by booking the emergency row, but be aware that armrests in these rows cannot be raised. Purchasing a premium economy seat might do the trick, and note that though business and first-class seats are roomier, they don\u2019t have armrests that can be lifted, either.\n\nWhen it comes to window versus aisle, there\u2019s no single best spot for plus-size travelers. You\u2019ll have more shoulder room in a window seat, but if it\u2019s a flight where you\u2019ll need to get out of your row frequently, the aisle is a better option. But choosing the aisle seat means you risk being bumped by every person and trolley passing by.\n\nBring your own seatbelt extender\n\nSometimes standard seatbelts aren\u2019t long enough to be secured safely and comfortably. Airlines always have a few seatbelt extenders available for the asking; however, not all flight attendants are sensitive in their delivery.\n\nIdeally, the flight attendant discreetly passes the neatly rolled extender to the passenger. But I have witnessed less-than-gracious handling \u2013 imagine a bright yellow belt dangling down the aisle as the flight attendant comes your way. Save the hassle and bring your own. (You can buy one on Amazon.)\n\nAirline passenger of size policies: Will you be forced to buy an extra seat?\n\nArrive at the airport early\n\nI have no interest in trying to sprint through an airport like a gazelle to catch my flight. Plan your arrival time well, so that you have at least an hour of chill time before you have to board your flight. You can move at your own speed \u2013 whatever that is \u2013 through security and on to your gate.\n\nGo to the washroom right before you board to avoid unnecessary visits to coffin-sized airplane bathrooms. And take a few minutes while you\u2019re at the airport to grab a sandwich and a bottle of water. Sometimes airplane tray tables won\u2019t fold down flat when you have an ample belly, so stick the water into the back of the seat pocket for easy access without the tray.\n\nTake advantage of the pre-boarding call meant for passengers with young children and anyone who needs extra assistance or time (perhaps you) getting onto the flight, especially if you\u2019re sitting at the back of the plane. It spares fellow passengers from getting hip-checked while you head down the aisle with bags in hand. This also gives you a chance to ask for a seat extender as you board (tell them your seat number), to get settled, and to adjust armrests as needed.\n\nBe extra kind to your seatmates\n\nYour row might be a bit snugger than some others on your flight. And it\u2019s hard to endure a huffy seatmate who resents your very existence. Smile, say hello and introduce yourself to your fellow passengers. It\u2019s tougher to be nasty to you if you\u2019re sweet as pie. I\u2019ve even bought drinks for those in my row as a thank you for their cooperation and understanding.\n\nIf your row is full and there are open seats around you, ask the flight attendant if it's feasible.\n\nIf the situation is unbearable for all, ask for assistance from flight attendants, who tend to be masterful problem solvers and may be able to move someone to make extra room.\n\nAvoid teeny, tiny spa robes\n\nPart of your vacay might include getting in some spa time. Some spas offer only one size of robe to guests, and that can be problematic for people of size. Ask if there are any larger robes available. I ask for the \u201croomiest.\u201d\n\nMy favorite spas are ones that provide you with an adequate robe without asking \u2013 but they are the exception rather than the rule. If there isn\u2019t an appropriate size available, ask if you can change in the treatment room before your service. There\u2019s also the option of bringing your own lightweight version. On the downside, even lightweight robes can be bulky to pack.\n\nChoose destinations where big is beautiful\n\nEven the most beautiful spot in the world isn\u2019t going to be enjoyable if you feel like you are being judged negatively for your size. Fortunately, there are options \u2013 most notably, countries where fatness isn\u2019t a big deal.\n\nJamaica is very accepting, for example, especially for plus-size women. As the local men say, \u201cBone is for the dog. Meat is for the man.\u201d While in Myanmar, I heard men tell our guide she was \u201clooking big.\u201d She explained that it was a compliment, meaning you\u2019re doing well and are successful.\n\nThe list of countries where bigger is better includes Samoa, Fiji, South Africa, Gambia, Egypt, and Kenya (nabbed a marriage proposal myself there from a Maasai chief). But there are plus-sized people in most places, so carry yourself like you belong wherever you go.\n\nThe part of the world where I think it\u2019s the toughest to be fat is Asia, particularly in places like Korea and Japan (sumo wrestlers exempted). Obesity is not as common, so you might draw stares and comments that make you feel like a freak. Don\u2019t let that stop you going there or anywhere you want to go. Learn to say hello in the local language and smile confidently. It\u2019s disarming.\n\nSeek out fat-friendly resorts and specialized travel agents\n\nFor some plus-sized travelers, the idea of being in a bathing suit in front of average weight people and potentially facing disapproving looks can be anxiety-provoking to the point they don\u2019t want to travel at all.\n\nOne alternative is to seek out a size-friendly environment such as with the use of a travel agent that specializes in making arrangements for the plus-size crowd. Abundant Travel founder Tony Harrell is a former national board member of NAAFA (National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance), so he gets it.\n\nWhen booking hotels, travelers with mobility issues should ask for details on the location and number of stairs, how far rooms are from the lobby, and whether the hallways are wide enough to accommodate devices like scooters, if necessary.\n\nBathrooms can be an issue, too. You might want to know whether a hotel has a walk-in shower or tub-shower combo, should there be mobility and access issues. Showers stalls on cruise ships can be teeny tiny and not suitable for some larger guests, so ask how they are equipped.\n\nStay comfortable but beware of DVT\n\nObese people are six times more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a potentially deadly condition caused by sitting for extended periods of time. Prevention means getting up every two to three hours to stretch, plus flexing toes, rotating ankles, and doing calf stretches while seated. If you\u2019re doing a long-haul flight, talk to your doctor about your DVT risk before you fly.\n\nWear loose clothing and layers \u2013 nothing tight. Dress in light layers and bring a shawl or lightweight blanket. Also, keep your shoes on. If you take them off, you might not be able to get them back on, since feet tend to swell while flying.\n\nPlus-sized folks tend to run a bit hotter. Keep your cool by packing a facial mist, pre-moistened towelettes, or a fan. Or get a neck wrap like Kafka\u2019s Cool Tie. Filled with polymer crystals that activate when wet, it keeps you comfy via cooling evaporative action.\n\nPack these: 9 products that take the stress out of travel\n\nPack with a backup plan in mind\n\nIf you check luggage and it doesn\u2019t show up at your destination, airlines may give you funds to buy replacement items, or reimburse you later. That\u2019s great, except when you\u2019re somewhere where plus-sized clothing isn\u2019t readily available.\n\nThere are two ways to deal with this possibility. You might consider traveling only with carry-on luggage so you don\u2019t have to worry. If you do need to check a bag, be sure to tuck some essentials in your carry-on bag, key items like a pair of underwear and a change of clothes. You\u2019ll be ready to go explore upon arrival, despite an AWOL bag.\n\nPlus-size travel wear: Clothes that flatter anybody and any body", "description": "Learn how to get the roomiest seat. the right questions to ask airlines, cruise lines and hotels and even find out about fat-friendly destinations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/08/USAT/d7dfd633-2b02-4f51-a582-17e08eeca703-intro2.jpg?crop=2270,1277,x0,y17&width=2198&height=1277&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
