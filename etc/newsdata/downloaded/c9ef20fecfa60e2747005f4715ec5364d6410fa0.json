By 1979, plastic bags accounted for 80 per cent of Europe\u2019s bag market.\n\nIn 1982, two of the biggest supermarket chains in the US \u2013 Safeway and Kroger \u2013 switched to plastic bags and by the end of the decade they almost replaced paper bags around the whole world.\n\nPlastic bags are now produced at a rate of one trillion a year, according to the UN.\n\nWhile animals have been documented consuming or becoming entangled in plastics, the toxic effects the man-made substances have when they break down and end up inside marine organisms are still not clear.\n\nIncreasingly countries are looking to ban the bags.\n\nIn 2002, Bangladesh became the first country in the world to do so and now more than two dozen countries have followed suit.\n\nHowever, alternatives to plastic bags are not necessarily the greener option. Although opting for paper or cotton bags would reduce litter and waste, they have other significant environmental effects.\n\nAccording to the UK Environment Agency, a paper bag has to be used three times to be as environmentally friendly as a plastic bag that is recycled.\n\nMaking paper bags uses more energy and water and they are also heavier, which makes them more expensive to transport.\n\nBags made of cotton \u2013 a crop which requires huge amounts of water to grow \u2013 need to be used at least 131 times to be as good as a recycled plastic bag.\n\nCurrently, the majority of plastic bags are not recycled and end up in landfill or polluting the environment where they take up to 1,000 years to degrade.", "description": "Plastic bags were invented to save the planet, according to the son of Swedish engineer Sten Gustaf Thulin who created them in 1959.\u00a0 The bags were developed as an alternative to paper bags, which were considered bad for the environment because they resulted in forests being chopped down.
