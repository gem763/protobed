But some of those Brexit supporters hinted on Thursday that they would be willing to back a deal even without the D.U.P. onboard.\n\nLabour denounces the deal and calls for a public vote.", "description": "The agreement was a step forward in the frantic negotiations to map out Britain\u2019s departure from the E.U., but the support of Parliament and Northern Irish lawmakers is far from assured.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/world/17brexit-briefing1/17brexit-briefing1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
