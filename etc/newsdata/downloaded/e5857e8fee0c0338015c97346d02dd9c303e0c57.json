ETH\u2019s volatile price action has come about concurrently with Bitcoin\u2019s massive surge to highs of over $10,000.\n\nIt is important to note that one analyst is now explaining that Ethereum may surge towards $260 next based off of its recently formed technical patterns, which would mark a significant surge from its current price levels.\n\nEthereum Surges 3% to $180, But Down Significantly from Daily Highs\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading up nearly 3% at its current price of $179.60, and it has been able to post a significant recovery from its weekly lows within the mid-$150 region that were set concurrently with Bitcoin\u2019s downwards movement to the lower-$7,000 region.\n\nEthereum\u2019s surge yesterday evening came about alongside Bitcoin\u2019s meteoric rally, which sent it to highs of roughly $10,300 before it incurred a massive influx of selling pressure that pushed its price down to the lower-$9,000 region.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s inability to find any solid support within the upper-$9,000 region signaled that bulls had overextended themselves, and similarly led Ethereum to face similar price action.\n\nOvernight ETH hit highs of just under $200 before it lost its momentum and quickly retraced to lows of under $180, and it has been consolidating ever since.\n\nIn the near-term, it is highly probable that Bitcoin\u2019s price action will steer that of ETH and other major altcoins.\n\nETH May Hit $260 in Near-Term, Claims Analyst\n\nJosh Olszewicz, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, explained in a recent tweet that that ETH\u2019s cloud formation and current trend channel may point to the possibility that it is positioned for a movement towards $260 in the coming month or so.\n\n\u201c$ETH 183 \u2014> 260 e2e looking likely in nov,\u201d he explained while pointing to the chart seen below.\n\n$ETH 183 \u2014> 260 e2e looking likely in nov pic.twitter.com/yFxAhDukA9 \u2014 Josh Olszewicz (@CarpeNoctom) October 26, 2019\n\nIn order for this possibility to be validated, however, it is imperative that BTC extends its upwards momentum, as a failure to do so could mean that significantly further losses are imminent and could mark this latest movement as a bull trap that precedes the next movement lower.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "description": "One analyst is now explaining that Ethereum (ETH) may surge towards $260 next based off of its recently formed technical patterns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_661816195-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
