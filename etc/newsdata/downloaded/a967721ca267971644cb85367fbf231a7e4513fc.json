It was such a harsh penalty, for nothing,\u201d the Haas driver told Sky Sports television.\n\nMagnussen said he had lost far more lap time by running wide at the \u2018nightmare\u2019 Turn Two rather than going through the bollards.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it. Why would you give me a penalty when I haven\u2019t won anything and in fact I\u2019ve lost a whole lot,\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to give (Lando) Norris that (eighth) position and McLaren those points because he didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d", "description": "Haas team boss Guenther Steiner blasted an 'idiotic' time penalty that cost his Danish driver precious points in Sunday's Russian Grand Prix.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435297805&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0SN", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
