Rand Paul (R-KY), one of Congress\u2019s most prominent non-interventionists, blocked a move on Thursday to bring a House-approved measure formally condemning President Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) attempted to gain consent to introduce the measure to the upper chamber\u2019s floor, but because it requires unanimous consent, any senator has the ability to thwart it.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing we can do right now is send President Trump a message that Congress, the vast majority of Democrats and Republicans, demand he reverse course,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nPaul argued Schumer was attempting to circumvent the U.S. Constitution by bringing the measure to a vote.\n\n\u201cHe should come to the floor and say that we are ready to declare war. We are ready to authorize force, and we are going to stick our troops in the middle of this messy, messy, five-sided civil war where we would be ostensibly opposed to the Turkish government that has made an incursion,\u201d he said.\n\nThe House had passed a resolution Wednesday condemning President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria in a 354-60 vote.\n\nThe move by Paul comes as U.S. officials said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has agreed to stop its offensive in Syria, signaling an end to a military campaign that has so far killed dozens of Kurdish fighters and drawn international condemnation.\n\nVice President Mike Pence announced the agreement for a five-day cease-fire after hours of bilateral meetings in Ankara among U.S. and Turkish officials \u2014 which included Erdogan and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The situation will be re-evaluated at the end of the five-day deal.\n\nErdogan\u2019s forces began Operation Peace Spring a week ago in northeast Syria, to clear border territories of Kurdish fighters so Ankara can send back Syrian refugees who fled to Turkey. The Turkish leader has previously insisted he would accept no cease-fire.\n\n\u201cThe United States and Turkey have both mutually committed to a peaceful resolution and future for the safe zone, working on an international basis to ensure that peace and security defines this border region with Syria,\u201d Pence stated.\n\nThe UPI contributed to this report.", "description": "Rand Paul blocked a move to bring a House-approved measure formally condemning Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP_19072716821266-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
