Lawmakers met with Fiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former top advisor on Russia, on Monday, despite Congress not formally being in session.\n\nOn Tuesday, George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of State, will meet with the committees, followed by Michael McKinley, the former top aide for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoTrump: Let Assad, Russia or China protect the Kurds Reporter presses Pompeo on whether he met with Giuliani in Warsaw Pompeo: 'I wish the NBA would acknowledge' China's treatment of Uyghur Muslims MORE; Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union on Thursday; and Laura Cooper, a defense official overseeing Ukraine, on Friday.\n\nMcKinley resigned last week, with The Washington Post reporting that he and others were disappointed in Pompeo's lack of public support for diplomats who have been asked to testify before the House as part of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSondland had been set to testify last week, but his appearance was abruptly blocked by the State Department. The Post reported that Sondland will tell the committee that a text he sent denying a quid pro quo between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call was dictated by Trump himself.\n\n\u201cAll of these depositions are to gather the data, to gather the data. And then from there, there will be hearings and there will be public testimony about exactly what happens. This is the process of gathering the details, understanding who said what, when. There's going to be a lot of data, a lot of texts, e-mails and testimony, all of that will come public in the days and weeks ahead,\u201d Rep.
