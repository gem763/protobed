Indeed, it\u2019s a statement of intent.\n\nLerner\u2019s fiction has always carried political critique\u2014of capital, war, climate change, technology; think of the hurricane that serves as a backdrop to 10:04 or the 2004 Madrid bombings at the center of the largely plotless Atocha. In this book, though, politics become something closer to the subject. Klaus, an analyst who lost his family in the Holocaust, sees the teenage patients he treats at the Foundation as \u201cboys, perpetual boys, Peter Pans, man-children.\u201d Lerner\u2019s subject is both a literal adolescent and the proposition put forth here\u2014the crisis of American masculinity. \u201cTheir country has fought and lost its last real war,\u201d in Klaus\u2019s view, \u201cin a word, they are overfed; in a word, they are starving.\u2026 Boys will be boys \u2026 and the violence will recur periodically\u2014like cicadas.\u201d We are, I am sorry to tell you, talking about Donald Trump.\n\nThat\u2019s where Darren, our fourth narrative point of view, comes into the novel. Darren is an outcast, a boy damaged in some unspecified way. He\u2019s less a character than a symbol, the \u201cemptied out\u201d American man Klaus warns us about. Violence does occur: At a party, he heaves a billiard ball at a girl\u2019s face. What sets him off? Again, I am sorry to report that it\u2019s the epithet \u201cfaggot.\u201d\n\nThe moment is violent, but more of a whimper than a bang. In the novel\u2019s abrupt coda, Adam, now grown, returns to Topeka to read his poetry. There\u2019s Darren, MAGA-capped, in the crowd of Westboro Baptist Church protesters who are there to greet him. \u201cWhat is happening in this moment?\u201d Lerner writes, with both candor and a sense of evasiveness. \u201cWhat are the characters thinking and feeling? Tell me what led up to this scene.\u201d I\u2019m not sure even Lerner knows, and his coy tactic of addressing the reader merely underscores that.\n\nOnly about 30 of The Topeka School\u2019s 300 pages are devoted to Darren. Though he\u2019s the plot\u2019s animating force, he is an uninteresting character, a mystery you don\u2019t really care to solve. I am not sure whether this means he is unknowable or just that the author couldn\u2019t figure him out. This makes him an outlier among Lerner\u2019s characters, who seem to make sense of themselves so naturally. In 10:04, for example, Ben welcomes a stranger into his home, an activist participating in the Zuccotti Park protests. The man is there to shower, but stays for dinner. It\u2019s a brief but incisive scene:\n\nHe talked to me about his travels, how more than anything else \u2026 his experiences in what he called the movement had helped him chill out, as he put it, about men. I thought he was embarking on a story of sexual awakening, but he meant something more general: instead of assuming that every male stranger past puberty was a physical and psychosocial threat, he was now open to the possibility of their decency.\n\nDarren, by contrast, never feels alive, exactly. This storyline about Darren is the foundation of The Topeka School, and it is not sound. I cringed when I saw Darren revealed in his red baseball cap.\n\nThere\u2019s a far subtler scene at the conclusion of The Topeka School, in which Adam confronts another father on the playground over the man\u2019s child\u2019s behavior. \u201cI\u2019ve been asking for your help in making the playground a safe space for my daughters; I recognize that my reaction to your son is not just about your son; it\u2019s about pussy grabbing; it\u2019s about my fears regarding the world into which I\u2019ve brought them.\u201d The other father declines to intervene. Then Lerner gives us this, parenthetically: \u201cI helped create her, Ivanka, my daughter, Ivanka, she\u2019s six feet tall, she\u2019s got the best body, she made a lot of money. Because when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t even tell if I think this is well done or not. I cannot answer why Lerner would bother with Trump at all. It is maybe a bid for significance, an attempt to show that autofiction, too, can manage social critique. And surely some readers will feel that The Topeka School does that successfully. It\u2019s admittedly a very small matter, but: I am saddened by this book\u2019s concerns more than by the book itself. Do we now need to add literary fiction to the long list of things Donald Trump has ruined?\n\nDoes it affect your reading to understand that Lerner is the son of Steve Lerner, a psychologist and filmmaker, and the pop psychologist Harriet Lerner, who was for years on the staff of the Menninger Clinic, in Topeka, Kansas? I think it\u2019s neither here nor there. Worrying over the facts behind autofiction is akin to caring about provenance; where were these coffee beans grown, and how were they harvested?\n\nThe surprise of The Topeka School is not that its events mirror the contours of the author\u2019s life. It\u2019s how the author uses his life as a point of interrogation, not of the self (a perfectly valid aim) but of society. The book does feel like an advancement, a way forward for contemporary writers interested, as Lerner is, in blurring this distinction between fiction and fact. It is possible, Lerner wants us to know, to do this in pursuit of what we might call (forgive me) the great American novel, the robust book that\u2019s full of ideas. The writer Sheila Heti showed how this might look, in her most recent novel, Motherhood, a book about her ambivalence about having children that is also somehow a book about the intergenerational trauma of the Holocaust.\n\nLerner is a masterful writer, but the politics of the moment are so baffling and strange that I wonder if any novelist could truly grapple with them. The Topeka School is spellbinding, if ultimately disappointing. In its best moments, it made me think of Valeria Luiselli\u2019s Lost Children Archive, another beautiful but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to braid together intimate observation and political critique. In its worst moments, I thought of Jonathan Safran Foer\u2019s Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, a mostly unreadable 2005 novel that attempted to understand 2001\u2019s terror attacks. Luiselli\u2019s project feels like a good-faith exercise; Foer\u2019s like a craven bid for gravitas. The Topeka School sits somewhere between those extremes.\n\nLerner is a writer of such psychological acuity that I genuinely can\u2019t believe he\u2019s chosen to depict Trumpism as, essentially, mental disorder. If you could excise Darren\u2019s storyline from this novel\u2014and the fact that one could do that, quite easily, is particularly damning\u2014this would be one of the year\u2019s finest books. It probably still is. Of all novelists now working in this country, Ben Lerner is surely among the few graceful, thoughtful, and humane enough that he might actually have something illuminating to say about the current state of the nation. We will just have to wait a little longer for that book.", "description": "In a subtle new work of autofiction, Ben Lerner takes on Trumpism.", "authors": ["Rumaan Alam"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/3df019253a2dda3472d3cb4d5c85f1e9c0043841.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
