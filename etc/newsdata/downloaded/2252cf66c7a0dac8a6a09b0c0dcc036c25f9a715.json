Nick Bosa had two sacks and five quarterback hits of Mayfield. Gilbert replaced Mayfield for the final three offensive snaps of the game.\n\nPer Mary Kay Cabot of the Cleveland Plain-Dealer, Mayfield had an ice wrap on his shoulder and a sleeve on his left leg after the game.\n\nMayfield said he\u2019s fine and that the three-snap reprieve to end the game wasn\u2019t because of injury.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be alright. I think the general nature of that game, just a physical game. I\u2019ll be good,\u201d Mayfield said.\n\nThe 49ers held Mayfield to the worst statistical performance of his career. He completed just 8 of 22 passes for 100 yards with two interceptions, though one of the picks was as much on Antonio Callaway as Mayfield. His 13.4 passer rating and 100 yards passing were new career-lows. He passed for 180 yards in a loss at Pittsburgh last October and posted a 52.6 rating in a loss to the Los Angeles Chargers two weeks earlier.", "description": "Baker Mayfield didn't finish Monday night's game against the San Francisco 49ers but it wasn't due to injury.
