Wakefield authored the debunked study linking the MMR vaccine to autism.\n\n\"I apologise to Dr Nicholl for the comparison with Dr Wakefield. I have the utmost respect for all of the country\u2019s hardworking medical professionals and the work they do in caring for the people of this country,\" Rees-Mogg said in a statement late Thursday evening following backlash.\n\nNicholl spoke out as a whistleblower in March, when he leaked secret NHS documents detailing concerns about the government\u2019s inability to stockpile certain drugs to BBC's Newsnight. Speaking on Newsnight Thursday evening, he said he was \"appalled\" by Rees-Mogg's comments.\n\n\u201cThis time the attack on me is premeditated and it\u2019s an attempt by government to bully whistleblowers, and it\u2019s not just doctors,\" he said.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "House of Commons leader said contributor to Brexit impact report was \u2018as irresponsible as Dr Wakefield.\u2019", "authors": ["Miriam Webber"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1165706640-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
