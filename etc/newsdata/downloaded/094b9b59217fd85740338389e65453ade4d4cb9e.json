He viewed the Congress with disdain. He also tried to undo some of the most important achievements of his predecessor, using executive power.\n\nThat was not Donald Trump, but another president who faced the ignominy of impeachment: Andrew Johnson.\n\nAs the impeachment inquiry of Trump unfolds, Johnson, never among America\u2019s most famous presidents, though widely considered one of the worst, is attracting renewed attention.\n\nJohnson was the first president to be impeached, by the House of Representatives in 1868. He escaped removal from office by a single vote short of the required two-thirds after his trial in the Senate, but was so disgraced he was denied his party\u2019s nomination that year.\n\nTrump and Johnson came from opposite ends of America\u2019s social spectrum \u2014 Johnson from deep poverty, Trump from great wealth. Yet they shared bellicose personalities, a disdain for political niceties, and a penchant for divisive, sometimes racist rhetoric.\n\nJon Meacham, a presidential historian who wrote a chapter on Johnson\u2019s case in a recent book on impeachment, has drawn a harsh comparison after Trump suggested that four activist Democratic congresswomen of color \u201cgo back\u201d to countries \u201cfrom which they came.\u201d Coupled with other statements by Trump, Meacham says Trump \u201cnow ranks with Andrew Johnson as perhaps the most racist of our presidents.\u201d\n\nMeacham sees other parallels as well.\n\n\u201cLike Trump, Johnson was a temperamentally tumultuous man who defied norms of the era,\u201d Meacham said in an email. \u201cIn Johnson\u2019s case, he actively sought to undo the verdict of the Civil War as the Republicans of the day saw it; in Trump\u2019s case, he is actively seeking to nullify the constitutional order by using his powers to undo the sovereignty of our elections.\u201d\n\nJohnson, a Democrat, became vice president under Republican Abraham Lincoln on a unity ticket during Lincoln\u2019s reelection campaign amid the Civil War in 1864. Johnson became president after Lincoln\u2019s assassination in April 1865.\n\nFriction grew steadily between Johnson, who contended blacks were incapable of self-government, and many of the Republicans who controlled Congress and favored extending voting rights to blacks.\n\nTensions peaked in 1868 when the House voted to impeach Johnson after alleging he had illegally fired War Secretary Edwin Stanton. Johnson was narrowly acquitted in a trial in the Senate.\n\nMark Summers, a University of Kentucky history professor, noted that many historians in the past argued that Johnson\u2019s impeachment was a mistake and that it was fortunate he was able to stay in office. Summers, like many contemporary historians, takes a different view, depicting Johnson as \u201ca very dangerous man.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have convicted him with great enthusiasm,\u201d Summers said.\n\nSummers says it\u2019s also dangerous to seek precise comparisons of the Johnson and Trump impeachment dramas.\n\n\u201cDefinitions of what presidents are allowed to do have changed,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald Trump is suggesting the whole process is illegitimate \u2014 Johnson made clear he\u2019d abide by the Senate decision.\u201d\n\nKeri Leigh Merritt, a historian and writer in Atlanta, learned about Johnson\u2019s personal background while researching her 2017 book, \u201cMasterless Men: Poor Whites and Slavery in the Antebellum South.\u201d\n\nShe said Johnson emerged from deeper poverty than any other U.S. president, even working as an indentured servant for a master who occasionally beat him.\n\nYet despite that sharp contrast with Trump\u2019s wealth, Merritt sees a similarity between the two men that dismays her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with someone who puts themselves above their country \u2014 puts their reputation and legacy first,\u201d she said.\n\nIn mid-September, Johnson was the subject of a \u201cWorst President Ever?\u201d presentation by University of Maryland history professor Michael Ross. It was part of a \u201cPints and Profs\u201d series hosted by a tavern in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cI convinced a good portion of the room that Johnson was the worst president, though some were lobbying for Richard Nixon or Woodrow Wilson,\u201d said Ross.\n\nRoss said he made clear at the outset of the event that Trump would not be a formal part of the presentation on the ground that his legacy remains to be determined. Yet Ross said Trump shares some key traits with Johnson, notably that he\u2019s \u201cunpresidential in his conduct.\u201d\n\nJohnson \u201cwas by every measure an awful president. He set back American race relations probably by 100 years,\u201d Ross said. Yet he said it was appropriate, on technical legal grounds, that the impeachment effort failed.\n\nAs for Trump, Ross doubts the Republican-controlled Senate will vote to remove him from office unless damning new evidence surfaces.\n\nAmong those intrigued by Trump-Johnson comparisons is author Brenda Wineapple. She has written several books about 19th century authors, but switched gears with her latest book, published in May \u2014 an account of Johnson\u2019s impeachment trial called \u201cThe Impeachers.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump stands accused of improperly pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden, Johnson angered many on the Union side of the Civil War with his solicitous approach to the defeated Confederacy, Wineapple said.\n\n\u201cYou can say he was courting a so-called foreign power,\u201d Wineapple said. \u201cJohnson wanted to reintegrate that seceded group of states without any cognizance of the fact they were fighting for the perpetuation of slavery.\u201d\n\nShe also sees similarities in the harsh rhetoric used or encouraged by the two presidents.\n\nIn public speeches in 1866, Johnson would suggest the hanging of some of his political rivals. Trump has grinned when supporters at his rallies chant of Hillary Clinton, \u201cLock Her Up\u201d and he recently suggested that a whistleblower in the Ukraine case is \u201cclose to a spy\u201d \u2014 possibly meriting the death penalty.\n\nThough the bid to oust Johnson eventually failed, Wineapple believes the dramatic events of 1868 validated the concept of the impeachment process.\n\n\u201cIt was a stain on Johnson\u2019s reputation \u2014 he didn\u2019t get renominated,\u201d she said. \u201cThe country didn\u2019t fall apart. It was a very orderly, serious process of trying to remove a president without a war.\u201d\n\nProfessor Benjamin Railton, coordinator of American Studies at Fitchburg State University in Massachusetts, has studied Johnson\u2019s impeachment trial and he sees echoes in today\u2019s House inquiry of Trump.\n\nHe said there was broad concern about the two presidents due to their conduct and rhetoric, yet the impeachment proceedings took shape in regard to specific allegations of illegality \u2014 for Trump the Ukraine case, for Johnson his contested removal of Stanton.\n\nRailton is curious what might lie ahead if Trump is impeached by the Democratic-controlled House but remains in office due to the Senate\u2019s refusal to convict him.\n\nHe says that Johnson, denied the presidential nomination by his Democratic Party in 1868, \u201cbecame even more aggressive\u201d as a lame duck, for example issuing a blanket amnesty to all former Confederates, including ex-President Jefferson Davis, in December 1868. In March 1869, Johnson refused to attend the inauguration of his successor, Ulysses S. Grant, after Grant refused to share a carriage with him en route to the ceremony.", "description": "The president traveled the country, fanning racial animus. He viewed the Congress with disdain.
