Lexus NX Mk1 (2015-present) Price used: from \u00a314,700 Owner rating: 89.71%\n\nDrivers said the Kia Sportage's fit and finish inside and out was outstanding and loved the infotainment system for ease of use to work the sat-nav, connect their smartphone and adjust the stereo.\n\n'Whether it\u2019s the styling, practicality, reliability or ride quality, almost everywhere you look owners praise the Sportage,' said Auto Express, which conducted the survey.\n\n'The only black mark concerns running costs, and fuel economy in particular; but this is a common theme among our SUV entries, and is partly made up for by a second-place finish for the Sportage\u2019s low servicing costs,' it added.\n\nDrivers commonly mentioned the Korean firm's market-leading seven-year warranty, which means many models bought second hand still have plenty of cover remaining.\n\nToyota's popular Prius marginally missed out, coming in second with a 92.75% rating - just .02% shy of the Kia Sportage\n\nKia's bigger Sorento took third spot in the order, with a score of 91.49%\n\nLexus always tends to score well in ownership polls, and one is no different. Four of the 10 best used cars are from the premium Japanese brand, with this RX the highest rated in fourth spot\n\nIn second spot was the taxi-driver's favourite, the Toyota Prius, receiving a score of 92.75 per cent.\n\nUsed examples of the latest four-generation hybrid can be purchased from \u00a313,900 the car magazine said, and it was also named by Auto Express as the best new model earlier this year.\n\nIt received praise for its strong reliability and equally good build quality, named the second-hand car that's least likely to breakdown.\n\nLow running costs, thanks to the hybrid powertrain, and strong safety credentials also gained the Prius owner plaudits.\n\nSkoda's Superb is the first non-Far East car to feature in the list. You can pick one up second-hand for as little as \u00a36,000 today\n\nThe Lexus IS is a premium saloon with plenty of kit. Owners gave it a 91.40% rating\n\nThe only British car - if you look beyond the fact it's owned by Indian firm Tata - is the Jaguar XF. While it tends not to have the best reliability record, owners still love it\n\nTaking third spot was another Kia, the third-generation Sorento SUV with a rating of 91.49 per cent, with keepers saying it's great to drive but can be a little thirsty when it comes to fuel.\n\nIn total, eight of the top 10 best cars rated by UK owners were either Korean Kias or Japanese Toyotas and Lexus.\n\nThe third-generation Skoda Superb and the original Jaguar XF are the only European cars making a top 10 dominated by Far East brands.\n\nHugo Griffiths, who led the Auto Express Driver Power analysis, said: 'With used cars frequently being bought outside of manufacturers\u2019 warranties, it\u2019s wise to do your homework before heading out to dealers.\n\n'Having analysed thousands of pieces of data, it\u2019s clear to me that European car makers could learn a thing or two from their Asian competitors when it comes to building cars that stand the test of time.'\n\nWe brought you the latest Lexus RX earlier, but those looking for a more affordable option should consider the previous-generation SUV, which can be bought for prices from \u00a38,200\n\nThe previous-generation Toyota RAV4 also featured in the top 10, with a score of 89.83%", "description": "The Korean Kia Sportage SUV (pictured) - which can be bought second-hand for around \u00a38,000 - received the highest rating from those who drive them in a poll of more than15,000 UK car drivers.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
