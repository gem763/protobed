The app is available to download now for iPhone with a rotating selection of chords available for free, and you can get access to its full library with a subscription costing $4.99 a month or $41.99 a year.\n\nI had a chance to try out Fender Songs ahead of its release, and I found that the app paired a slick interface with a database of chords that sounded pretty accurate to my ears. However, I also found that the app has its limitations, which means it won\u2019t teach you exactly how to play many of its songs. It\u2019s a great resource for anyone who\u2019s getting to grips with playing their first few chords, but more advanced players might find it frustrating.\n\n\u201cPeople are interested in learning songs that are familiar to them, not what they find by searching Google\u201d\n\n\u201cThis app\u2019s really aimed at any guitar player who wants to learn how to play songs that they know,\u201d Fender\u2019s chief technology officer Ethan Kaplan told me in an interview. Fender\u2019s aim is to have a library of chords that\u2019s big enough so that you can reliably find a song that you\u2019re already interested in, rather than picking based on which song has the best user-submitted chords on one of the free services available around the web. Look up your favorite single, and you\u2019ll find that the app includes chords for the rest of the album for good measure.\n\n\u201cPeople are interested in learning songs that are familiar to them, not what they find by searching Google,\u201d Kaplan says.\n\nThe app is organized a lot like a music streaming service, except that once you\u2019ve found a song you want to play along with, you\u2019ll also find its lyrics and chords. You can then scroll through and learn its chords at your own pace, or press play to have the song show you the chords in real time. By default, the app plays an auto-generated bass line and drum track as a backing track, but you can strip this back to just drums or a metronome if you prefer. Meanwhile, if you want to play along with the actual songs, then you\u2019ll need to have an Apple Music subscription.\n\nOnce you\u2019re feeling confident enough, the app then lets you record yourself playing a song using your phone\u2019s front-facing camera while you read the song\u2019s chords off the screen. You can even try to sing along with the lyrics if you\u2019re feeling particularly confident. Any videos you film are saved to your phone\u2019s camera roll.\n\nThere are even chords available for songs that don\u2019t have guitars in them\n\nIn order to build up its database of songs, Fender uses software that automatically transcribes music. It sounds similar to its discontinued Riffstation app that the company used to offer on Mac and PC that would transcribe whichever music you uploaded to it. However, Kaplan said that once the software has done its work, Fender will go in and manually edit the results. Kaplan says this approach lets Fender add more music to the app \u201cby the second,\u201d and can offer new songs almost immediately after they\u2019re released. Fender also says it\u2019s made a deal with Warner Music to make sure that its artists\u2019 music is accurately transcribed.\n\nThe fact that these chords are initially generated by software adds an interesting element to Fender Songs, because it means you can play along with music that doesn\u2019t include any guitars at all, like \u201cRoyals\u201d by Lorde or \u201cBad Guy\u201d by Billie Eilish. At a time when sales of guitars have declined so much that one of Fender\u2019s main competitors, Gibson, was forced to file for bankruptcy last year, getting fans of non-guitar-based music into playing the guitar could provide a lifeline for Fender\u2019s physical sales.\n\nWhen I tried using the app to play a couple of songs that I already knew the chords to, I found that the app\u2019s notation perfectly matched what I\u2019d learned previously. It\u2019s certainly a nicer experience than trying to find accurate chords online, and then having to awkwardly scroll through a webpage while you play the song from a separate source.\n\nThe chords sounded accurate, but Fender Songs isn\u2019t going to be teaching you guitar solos anytime soon\n\nHowever, you\u2019ll notice that throughout this article I\u2019ve avoided saying that Fender Songs actually teaches you how to play the songs in its library. That\u2019s because it\u2019s only teaching you the basic chords that make up a song. It doesn\u2019t make any attempt to teach you the individual notes that a guitarist is playing. Chords might be enough for a song like \u201cGood Riddance (Time Of Your Life)\u201d by Green Day, but Fender Songs struggles with anything more complicated.\n\nTake \u201cCreep\u201d by Radiohead as an example. If you play the G, B, C, Cm chord progression that Fender Songs lists, then you\u2019ll certainly end up with something that can be played along with the song. But it\u2019s also absolutely not what guitarist Jonny Greenwood is playing during the song\u2019s verse, when he slowly picks out the individual notes within these chords. For that you\u2019d need full tablature, rather than the simple chords that Fender Songs displays.\n\nWhen I asked about this, Fender\u2019s Kaplan told me that the company is hard at work on full tablature support, but that at the moment it only plans to bring it to Fender Play, the guitar teaching platform that it launched in 2017. However, while the company would \u201clove\u201d to bring this functionality into Fender Songs, its current focus is just on chords.\n\nAn Apple Music subscription is an almost-essential companion\n\nAlthough Fender Songs is technically usable without an Apple Music subscription, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d recommend it. If you\u2019re not playing along to the real song, then the app gives you the option of playing along to a metronome, an auto-generated drum track, or an auto-generated drum and bass track. Although these backing tracks are the right tempo, their rhythm is often completely wrong, to the extent that they can be distracting. Kaplan admitted that the backing tracks basically amount to a \u201cglorified click track,\u201d rather than an actual backing track.\n\nIt would be great to see Fender Songs offer Spotify compatibility in the future, but while Kaplan said that Fender is \u201ccontinuing to talk to\u201d other music streaming services, he refused to be drawn on when these might be added.\n\nIf you\u2019re an existing Apple Music subscriber, then Fender\u2019s latest app is a great resource to find chords to let you play along with music, regardless of whether a song actually uses guitars in the first place. It\u2019s got a slick interface, and a vast and accurate library of chords. Just don\u2019t go in expecting the app to be able to teach you your favorite guitar solo.", "description": "Fender Songs is a new iOS app which lets you learn the chords to millions of songs on guitar, piano, or the ukulele.
