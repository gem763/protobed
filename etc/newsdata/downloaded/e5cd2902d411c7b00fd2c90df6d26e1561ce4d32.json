While we have progressed so much as a society in terms of our openness about mental health or cancer diagnosis, the loss of a child or pregnancy still makes people feel uncomfortable.\n\nHow and when we want to share our losses, if at all, should, of course, always be a personal choice. However, the culture of secrecy and silence surrounding baby loss, in part, contributes to the UK having one of the worst stillbirth rates in the developed world. Sadly, the majority of women who have experienced multiple miscarriages (of which I\u2019m one) never find out the reason why. If only we talked about it more, not only could we accelerate our understanding of those preventable cases of stillbirth (estimated to be around 50 per cent) but also alleviate some of the unnecessary pain and isolation that baby loss brings into people\u2019s lives.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 20 celebrities who have opened up about baby loss Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMidwives don\u2019t want to scare women with too much information about the commonality of stillbirth (around 1 in 225 in the UK) and women are often dispatched from A&E after a miscarriage with the unhelpful and hurtful advice to \u201ctry again in a few months\u201d, and rarely any specialist help to deal with the grief and trauma that can often be the result of this all too common tragedy (which affects a staggering 1 in 4 pregnancies).\n\nBut there is no comfort in the commonality of the statistics amid the isolation that miscarriage can bring. This sense of loneliness is also amplified by the bizarre perpetuation of the \u201c12-week rule\u201d, an archaic practice where women are still advised not to share the news of their pregnancy before they\u2019ve passed the \u201csafe\u201d three-month mark. It\u2019s an approach that often leaves women with little or no support network if they miscarry, as well as suggesting that there\u2019s a hierarchy of grief determined by how far along the balls of cells in your uterus have developed.\n\nI didn\u2019t know just how painfully common miscarriage was until other women reached out to me privately in the aftermath of my own multiple losses over the past few years. It\u2019s the shameful secret of \u201cfailure\u201d that no one wants to own too loudly. It\u2019s an admission that your body isn\u2019t perfect after all, that it couldn\u2019t sustain the life you so badly wanted. People offer the platitudes that they think will help but the aftermath can often spill out into future pregnancies and live births where your sense of anxiety and the development of PTSD can affect women for years after.\n\nBaby Loss Awareness Week (which takes place from 9-15 October every year) is an opportunity to acknowledge and remember those that have died. This year, the Miscarriage Association is campaigning to make it easier for anyone who needs specialist psychological support following pregnancy loss to access it free, on the NHS \u2013 a much needed and currently sorely lacking service that I wish had been available.\n\nMy first miscarriage was a \u201cmissed miscarriage\u201d at 12 weeks. It\u2019s what they call it when there is no blood: the body hasn\u2019t recognised that the pregnancy isn\u2019t viable and most women spend three months being blissfully unaware that there\u2019s anything wrong until the first scheduled scan where no heartbeat can be found. As \u201cnature hadn\u2019t taken its course\u201d I was offered an immediate ERPC \u2013 surgery to remove the \u201cretained products of conception\u201d \u2013 a straightforward surgery but unhelpfully and coldly termed. The aftermath leaves your body sore and your hormones crashing as you struggle to come to terms with what you\u2019ve lost. My second miscarriage was more of the bloody variety. My third; a protracted and miserable haemorrhaging over six weeks, which ended in a dangerous infection and urgent surgery.\n\nI carried on working throughout the first two. Being self-employed, financially I had no choice. I\u2019d dutifully followed the \u201c12-week rule\u201d so almost no one knew of the pregnancies and I became quite the expert at layering sanitary protection to soak up the blood and the mental armour to hide it from the people I worked with, rightly concerned I would lose work I could ill-afford to if I was honest about what was happening to my body. And then, when I chose to disclose my loss the third time, I was met with uncomfortable silences and awkward looks that made my own grief all the worse.\n\nWhat has soothed and helped with the process of healing is hearing other women\u2019s stories \u2013 both online and in person. A few weeks ago, I sat down with fellow campaigner Sophie Daniels to record a conversation about our own personal journeys for The Art of Losing Podcast. In the frank sharing of our own stories of recurrent miscarriage and stillbirth, we hope to normalise the topic and neutralise some of the fear and awkwardness surrounding it. Because to know that you are not the only one who has wrestled with this loss is such a comfort in an otherwise difficult journey. I hope it helps you too.\n\nCatherine Anne Davies is a writer, producer, and musician (aka The Anchoress).
