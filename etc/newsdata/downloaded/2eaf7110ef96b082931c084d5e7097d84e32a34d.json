In July, President Trump had a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where it has been alleged that the U.S. withheld aid to the country unless a corruption probe was opened into Hunter Bide, son of former Vice President Joe Biden. This was all detailed in a whistleblower report from a reported CIA agent assigned to the White House, who is a registered Democrat, had worked with a 2020 Democratic candidate, and was on the staff of the National Security Council under Obama. Yeah, with how Democrats are with Russian collusion nonsense, this was a report that totally beyond reproach\u2026yes, I\u2019m being sarcastic.\n\nAre you kidding me? First of all, the whistleblower had no first-hand knowledge as this person did not listen in on the call. CNN contributor Phil Mudd, who had previously worked for the FBI and CIA, slammed this person since it\u2019s not the intelligence community\u2019s job to snitch on the president; Trump can say whatever he wants to a foreign leader. And Mudd is no defender of this administration. The lack of first-hand knowledge is evident in the report\u2019s numerous errors.\n\nWhistleblower deserves our praise & gratitude.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump getting very sloppy & careless in corrupt practices & cover up attempts.\n\n\n\nDemocrats & Republicans (those who have a conscience) need to work together to prevent desperate moves by Trump that could wreak further havoc. \u2014 John O. Brennan (@JohnBrennan) September 26, 2019\n\nHunter Biden has zero experience in the energy sector but was placed on the board of such a company, Burisma, being paid some $50,000/month while his father was in office. The allegation is that he was there banking on daddy\u2019s name and offering access to the Obama White House. The whole situation is unethical and a conflict of interest, but the Trump White House released the transcript of the call which debunked the most absurd allegations lobbed at President Trump by Democrats. There was no quid pro quo here. The Ukrainians didn\u2019t even know the aid was under review over corruption concerns. This isn\u2019t new. Nothing in this story is out of the ordinary or unprecedented. It\u2019s an even shoddier case for impeachment being executed by Democrats, which is the apex of political theater. This isn\u2019t a real impeachment push since the GOP would have equal access to documents and have subpoena power. This whole narrative would be torpedoed in two seconds. It might already have. We don\u2019t know. The Democrats are holding this Trump impeachment hearing in secret, selectively releasing portions of texts or transcripts from closed-door testimony that keeps this narrative alive. It\u2019s an offshoot of the equally embarrassing Russian collusion myth.\n\nThat circus is being investigated by Attorney General William Barr. In fact, this investigation was referenced in the Trump-Ukraine phone call, where the president asked Zelensky if he would help our Department of Justice\u2019s inquiry into the origins of this Russia collusion probe. Again, that\u2019s not an unreasonable request. Recently, Barr expanded the probe and NBC News reported that intelligence officials are running for legal counsel since something significant was uncovered [emphasis mine]:\n\nA review launched by Attorney General William Barr into the origins of the Russia investigation has expanded significantly amid concerns about whether the probe has any legal or factual basis, multiple current and former officials told NBC News. The prosecutor conducting the review, Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, has expressed his intent to interview a number of current and former intelligence officials involved in examining Russia's effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including former CIA Director John Brennan and former director of national intelligence James Clapper, Brennan told NBC News. Durham has also requested to talk to CIA analysts involved in the intelligence assessment of Russia's activities, prompting some of them to hire lawyers, according to three former CIA officials familiar with the matter. And there is tension between the CIA and the Justice Department over what classified documents Durham can examine, two people familiar with the matter said. [\u2026] Justice Department officials have said that Durham has found something significant, and that critics should be careful. Skeptics who have been trying to track Durham's movements say he has yet to interview key figures, including former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe, former FBI agent Peter Stzrok and former FBI general counsel James Baker. \"Nobody who knows anything has been interviewed,\" said a person in touch with those former officials.\n\nYeah, that latter portion was buried, but you can see why Brennan probably wants this impeachment push to be successful. On top of this, you have the DOJ inspector general report on alleged FISA abuse that occurred under the Obama administration that will only increase the need to put all of these ex-Obama intelligence czars under the microscope and if it\u2019s anything like what we\u2019ve seen emanate from the FBI\u2014it\u2019s not going to be good. We\u2019re just going to have to wait and see, but if I\u2019m a former Obama intelligence official\u2014I\u2019d be running to get lawyered up too.\n\nBarr had previously said the answers he has received thus far about why this Russia investigation began were not satisfactory and that it appears that this whole affair looked like a witch hunt.", "description": ".10/24/2019 0:53:16AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/181/2956a845-8849-4e14-a4ee-fa21506f01c6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
