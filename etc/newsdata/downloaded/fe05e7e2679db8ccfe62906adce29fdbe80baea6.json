The firm responded by promising to adjust pay rates at the start of 2020.\n\nPwC, which has the best audit quality track record based on ASIC's inspection program, said its audit services were set at a premium to allow for investment in staff, methods and technology.\n\n\"At PwC, audit is not used as a loss leader for growth in other parts of the firm. The level of profitability across our Assurance, Consulting and Financial Advisory businesses is broadly equal,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\n\"Our audits utilise technology and teams with a broad mix of skills and experience required to deliver a high quality audit. We set audit fees that reflect the high quality of work we aspire to deliver and at a level that enables us to continue to invest in technology, methodologies and learning and development for our people.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEY denied it was earning gross margins of up to 80 per cent and said that \"experienced senior individuals\", including audit partners who signed off on work, were a key part of the firm's audit service.\n\n\"Like any good business, we control our costs by continually reviewing our processes and procedures, the use of automation, technology, data and analytics and resourcing and working with clients to improve their financial statement close process,\" the EY spokeswoman said.\n\nA KPMG spokeswoman said the firm would \"never compromise our audit quality for the sake of margin\".\n\nASIC and Deloitte declined to comment.\n\nASIC's audit inquiry submission\n\nASIC will hand its submission to the inquiry into audit quality, being run by the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, this week. Final submissions to the broad-ranging inquiry are due at the end of October.\n\nThe regulator's submission, expected to be much longer than the suggested five-page guidance, will provide ASIC's take on the relationship between auditing and consulting services and potential conflicts of interests, the level and effectiveness of competition in audit and related consulting services, audit quality, the role of audit in detecting fraud and misconduct, and the effectiveness of its enforcement regime.\n\nASIC is likely to make another push to have the power to force auditors to redo work that they feel has not been adequately carried out in its submission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nASIC's current approach focuses on having the market fully informed as opposed to punishing audit firms for poor work. This means ASIC favours companies and auditors agreeing to announce planned disclosures, such as assets that will be revalued, because the market can then be quickly informed.", "description": "New data shows the big four have gross margins of up to 80 per cent when it comes to audits of ASX 300 clients but they say the numbers don't reveal the whole story.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2718%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_42/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c740c2d8d438d80eb4a6ff82b09134b801f62838", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
