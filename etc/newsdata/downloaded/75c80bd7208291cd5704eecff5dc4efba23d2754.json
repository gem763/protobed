Sir Christopher Hohn, one of the richest men in the UK, has given a hefty \u00a350,000 to the environmental group. Sir Hohn told The Daily Telegraph: \u2018I am a personal funder of Extinction Rebellion. 'I recently gave them \u00a350,000 because humanity is aggressively destroying the world with climate change and there is an urgent need for us all to wake up to this fact.\u2019 The charity he co-founded, the Children\u2019s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), is thought to have given a further \u00a3150,000 to the climate activist group. Sir Christopher Hohn It is claimed none of the money he donated went towards the group\u2019s acts of civil disobedience. His hedge fund, named the Children\u2019s Investment Fund, used to own a two per cent stake in Coal India, a state-backed company based in Kolkata. The stake was sold in 2014. The firm extracted more than 400 million tonnes of coal from the ground in the year of the sale. Andrew Medway, a former bank trader who organises the group\u2019s donations, said more than half of the donations have been raised online and more than 6,000 people have donated more than \u00a3600,000 this week. Other high profile donors include rock band Radiohead, which has already given \u00a3250,000, and Joe Corr\u00e9, the founder of lingerie firm Agent Provocateur founder and son of Dame Vivienne Westwood, who has donated \u00a350,000. US organisation Climate Emergency Fund, which is mainly financed by Aileen Getty, 62, the granddaughter of J Paul Getty, once the world\u2019s richest man, has given \u00a3330,000 to the protestors.\n\nBrown was being helped onto the plane by staff, before breaking free and apparently managing to shin up the side of the fuselage and onto the roof.\n\nHe admitted he was 's***ing myself' while filming a video in the wind from on top of the Embraer 190 plane bound for Amsterdam as the activists began three days of action at London City Airport.\n\nThe Commissioner said: 'My early understanding is somebody has been arrested after they presumably bought a ticket, went through security perfectly normally, went up the steps of a plane and hurled themselves on top of a plane.\n\n'Actually, that was a reckless, stupid and dangerous thing to do for all concerned. But I think you can see that is quite a hard thing to predict or stop from happening.\n\n'We will do a full review of the security there, of course we will.\n\n'These protesters have shown they are determined to go where they can, when they can, occupy what they can and disrupt whoever they can, frankly.'\n\nDame Cressida also criticised Extinction Rebellion for diverting resources away from officers usually dedicated to tackling knife crime or safeguarding children.\n\n'We are already taking people away from keeping people safe in local areas and putting them into central London, particularly, more than in the last five years,' she said.\n\n'We have the skills, the leadership and fantastic officers to continue to do that, but of course it takes its toll.'\n\nAddressing Extinction Rebellion activists, she said: 'Protest lawfully or go home. You have caused disruption to many people and caused misery to some people's lives.\n\n'We have cleared you away again and again, and now secured the sites you really wanted to occupy. You have a place to protest. Go and protest there.'\n\nBrown, a London 2012 bronze medallist, was arrested just last month over a foiled plot to fly drones over Heathrow to shut it down - and questions will now be asked over how he managed to get through security checks on Thursday.\n\nIn a dramatic Facebook Live video filmed from on top of the plane yesterdayafternoon, watched by more than 5,000 people, Brown said: 'OK, here I am, on top of a f***ing aeroplane at City Airport. I hate heights, I'm s***ing myself.\n\n'I managed to get on the roof. Oh man, I'm so shaky. I hope this is going out live. So this is all about the climate and ecological crisis. We're protesting against Government inaction on climate and ecological breakdown.'\n\nEmergency service workers used a cherry picker to eventually release him from top of the plane, while an orange blanket was placed over him to protect him from the cold. He was eventually brought down shortly after 2pm.\n\nRobert Sinclair, CEO of London City Airport, said the two cancelled flights were BA8453 to Amsterdam, where James Brown climbed on top of the aircraft and was removed, and BA4472, due to a knock-on crew shortage.\n\nHe said: 'The airport has remained fully operational throughout the day and has run an almost complete schedule of flights, with just two flights cancelled as a result of the protest activity.\n\n'We want to thank all our passengers today for their patience, and the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police for their support and professionalism.\n\n'If you are flying from London City Airport, please do check the status of your flight with your airline before travelling to the airport.'\n\nAt City Airport, activists also blocked the roads into the site, shut down its Docklands Light Railway station and stopped an Aer Lingus flight to Dublin taking off as they unleashed a three-day Hong Kong-style protest.\n\nExtinction Rebellion spokesperson Rupert Read said: 'By non-violently shutting down this airport, in homage to the style of the Hong Kong democracy protesters, we are demonstrating the utter frailty of the transport systems that countries such as ours, unwisely, have come to depend upon.'\n\nPolice confirmed more than 1,000 people have been arrested in the XR protests since Monday including 50 at the airport, with 29 charged with offences including obstructing a highway and knowingly failing to comply with a Section 14 Public Order Act condition.\n\nFire crews cover the man in a sheet before removing him from the British Airways plane at London City Airport\n\nEmergency services use a cherry picker to try to remove an Extinction Rebellion protester on top of the BA plane\n\nDame Cressida insisted yesterday that Scotland Yard does have enough cells to hold and process all of the people who have been arrested.\n\nShe said her officers are working 12-hour shifts to staff the 'huge operation', supported by hundreds of colleagues from police forces across the country.\n\n'It adds up to an enormous number of people who are working very hard to keep our streets moving and to keep us safe from the protests,' she said.\n\n'Responding to emergency calls is going well only because Met officers are working extremely hard.\n\n'We have had to clear people from 12 sites. Protesters were determined to take over and occupy important arterial roads in London, and stay occupied for a two-week period. It is utterly irresponsible and completely unreasonable.\n\n'We have cleared those sites, we have secured those sites. We need to keep police officers at those sites to make sure they don't come back.'\n\nPolice are working to clear a camp in St James' Park, with Trafalgar Square the only other site still occupied in central London.\n\nBrown is a partially-sighted former Irish Paralympian cyclist who was banned from athletics in 2016 for a doping violation\n\nFire crews put a sheet over Brown as they try to get him down from the British Airways plane at City Airport\n\nThe man on the BA plane at City Airport has been identified by Extinction Rebellion as former Paralympic cyclist James Brown\n\nPolice officers search the Extinction Rebellion protester after he was removed from on top of a British Airways plane\n\nPolice officers speak to Brown after the emergency services got him down from the BA plane at London City Airport\n\nMr Brown is taken away in the grey police van having managed get on top of the British Airways plane at the airport\n\nBA insisted officials were 'investigating what's happened as a matter of urgency' and said staff were re-booking affected customers onto alternative flights to Amsterdam to get them to their destinations as quickly as possible.\n\nBrown was said to have been given 'special assistance' by BA staff at the gate. He had a flight ticket and seat and had checked in, but arrived several hours before his scheduled lunchtime flight and was later joined by a woman.\n\nOne BA source said: 'Staff felt sorry for him as he was clearly partially sighted and was having trouble reading his mobile phone as he sat in the waiting area. He had the phone right up to his face and head sideways.\n\n'We felt sorry for him. He was given assistance as is the norm for those who may have difficulties boarding. A woman then joined him and walked alongside him. Somehow, he managed to get on top of the plane.'\n\nJames Brown is pictured with his bronze medal after the men's individual B time trial at the London 2012 Paralympics\n\nThe source added that Brown 'may have been given a leg-up as it isn't easy'. He said both Brown, who was on top of the plane for more than an hour, and his accomplice were arrested.\n\nBrown had been helped up the stairway to the plane by contract staff called by British Airways ground staff at gate 7.\n\nThey walked him up the stairs, guiding him to the doorway. The Paralympian then jumped onto the handrail and clambered onto the top of the aircraft himself to begin his protest.\n\nYesterday morning, a protester forced the Aer Lingus flight to Dublin to turn around on the runway as he stood up and roamed the cabin while giving a lecture on climate change just before take-off. Angry passengers urged cabin crew to 'do us all a favour and remove him from the plane', with others telling him: 'You need to sit down.'\n\nThe security breach comes as passengers arriving for flights had to show their boarding cards before entering the terminal, after XR protesters declared they would occupy and shut down the airport in East London.\n\nWitnesses reported 'an extraordinary number of police officers' at the terminal as demonstrators try to emulate protesters who cancelled more than 1,000 flights as they condemned police brutality in Hong Kong.\n\nViewers of a video of the incident said it could have been worse, with one tweeting: 'This is a major breach of airport security. Lucky he was only an eco-preacher not a terrorist. Things would have been very different.'\n\nPolice had arrested 12 people with the demonstration just 30 minutes old after it began at 9am yesterday, as video footage showed people involved in the 'Fly Today, No Tomorrow' protest being dragged away by officers.\n\nAround 150 protesters were sitting in the road outside the terminal by lunchtime - chanting and blocking all traffic in and out of the airport, as police moved in to arrest them one by one for alleged public order fences.\n\nAn activist, dressed in a suit, gestures after scaling the roof above the entrance to London City Airport yesterday morning\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters with bicycles block a roundabout near London City Airport during the demonstration\n\nPolice officers arrest an activist at London City Airport during the fourth day of demonstrations by the group\n\nPolice officers stand guard as Extinction Rebellion demonstrators block an entrance at City Airport in London\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters with bikes block a roundabout during a demonstration near London City Airport\n\nA protester is removed by police as climate change action group Extinction Rebellion stage a protest at City Airport\n\n: A protester is removed by police during the Extinction Rebellion demonstration at London City Airport this afternoon\n\nPolice officers cut the locks of Extinction Rebellion protesters during a demonstration near London City Airport\n\nA man is removed by police officers after activists staged a 'Hong Kong style' blockage at City Airport\n\nA police officer checks on an Extinction Rebellion protester with bikes as they block a roundabout at City Airport\n\nA protester is removed by police as climate change action group Extinction Rebellion stage a protest at City Airport\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists block the roundabout at the entrance to London City Airport this afternoon\n\nPolice officers arrest an activist at London City Airport during the fourth day of demonstrations by the group\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists block the roundabout at the entrance to City Airport by gluing themselves to their bikes\n\nA police officer sits next to an Extinction Rebellion activist who block a roundabout at City Airport this afternoon\n\nExtinction Rebellion climate change protesters sing as they block a road outside City Airport in London this afternoon\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists block the roundabout at the entrance to London City Airport this afternoon\n\nConservative MP David Davies told MailOnline he was 'deeply concerned' by Extinction Rebellion, adding: 'We are allowing a few thousand people to dictate terms to us. They are holding a major capital city to ransom.'\n\nThe pilot on the Aer Lingus flight was told about the on-board protest at the end of the runway, and the plane then had to turn around and taxi back along to the terminal before the man was arrested by police who came on board.\n\nThe pilot then told passengers that the plane ironically had to take on board more fuel to replace what was used up during the protest. Passengers applauded the crew after the pilot praised how they handled the situation.\n\nThe man holding up the Aer Lingus flight, which later took off with a delay, calmly told fellow passengers: 'I don't wish to travel but I don't wish to get off. I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm extremely sorry for the inconvenience.'\n\nAs others asked 'How long are you going to be?' and told him to 'sit down', he added: 'Today there's a protest at this airport. We have two generations of human civilisation left if we carry on doing what you're doing.'\n\nAn Extinction Rebellion protester got on board a plane a London City Airport as the demonstrations continued\n\nPassengers on board the Aer Lingus flight to Dublin urged cabin crew to 'do us all a favour and remove him from the plane'\n\nThe man is spoken to by cabin crew on board the Aer Lingus flight before passengers were taken off then allowed back on\n\nA demonstrator wearing an Extinction Rebellion tie is removed by police officers at London City Airport\n\nAn Extinction Rebellion protesters smiles as he is arrested and led away by police at London City Airport\n\nPolice officers detain Extinction Rebellion protester during the demonstration at London City Airport\n\nPolice officers carry away an Extinction Rebellion protester during the demonstration at London City Airport yesterday\n\nViewers of a video of the Aer Lingus incident said it could have been far more serious, with one tweeting: 'This is a major breach of airport security.

Many of the arrested were elderly who smiled as they were led away and sat on the pavement before being removed in vans.\n\nBBC Newsnight political editor Nicholas Watt said he was on board the Aer Lingus flight involved, tweeting: 'My flight from London City airport to Dublin has just been grounded by a climate change protester.\n\n'On runway and about to take off when smartly dressed man in late middle age stood up with iPhone to deliver lecture on climate change. Cabin crew calmy and very politely asked protester to resume his seat.\n\n'Politely but persistently he declined and proceeded to deliver his lecture on climate change in aisle. Some passengers annoyed, others listened to lecture with humour as cabin crew alerted pilot.'\n\nAn Aer Lingus spokesman said: 'Aer Lingus can confirm that a passenger scheduled to travel on EI283 flight from London City to Dublin airport was removed from the flight due to disruptive behaviour on board.\n\nA man is removed by police officers after activists staged a 'Hong Kong style' blockage at City Airport\n\nAn Extinction Rebellion protester stands on the top of the roof during a demonstration at London City Airport\n\nA man is removed by police officers after activists stage an Extinction Rebellion climate change protest at City Airport\n\nPassengers make their way past Extinction Rebellion demonstrators and police officers at City Airport in London\n\nPolice officers watch as an activist scales the roof above the entrance to London City Airport\n\nA man dressed in a suit is led away by police after they arrested him at London City Airport\n\nA man is escorted by police officers from the Docklands Light Railway station at London City Airport yesterday\n\nPolice officers detain an Extinction Rebellion protester during a demonstration at London City Airport yesterday\n\n'The safety and security of our guests and crew is our number one priority and as a result, a full security check of the aircraft was completed prior to the flight departing.\n\nGrandfather-of-four, 83, arrested for NINTH time in an XR protest Police arrested a veteran 83-year-old environmental campaigner yesterday for the third time in just a week - and the ninth time in the last year. Retired probation officer Phil Kingston, from Bristol, said before his arrest that he was joining the Extinction Rebellion climate change protest at London City Airport for his four grandchildren and 'all of their generation'. Phil Kingston said he is taking part in the protest at City Airport for his four grandchildren and 'all of their generation' Mr Kingston said it was the ninth time he had been arrested with XR within the past year, and joked with LBC radio that he had been 'just going to get a plane' before he was dragged outside. He added: 'I'm very happy to be here.' It comes after Mr Kingston was arrested on Monday for spraying the words 'Life not death for my grandchildren' on the walls of the Treasury in Westminster, and last Thursday for spraying fake blood on the same building. Mr Kingston is dragged away from London City Airport Asked why he was at the protest, Mr Kingston said: 'My grandchildren and all of their generation. I'm mostly here for the poorest peoples, who have done the least to cause climate breakdown and are suffering the most. '(They) are predicted to suffer dreadfully in the coming years, as eventually we all will, unless we do the most enormous turnaround which I don't even know if that's possible now. Police also arrested campaigner Mr Kingston on Monday for a spray paint protest at the Treasury building in Westminster 'But if it isn't possible, then I am here to help us tell the truth and prepare for what we need to prepare together. Lastly, I'm a Christian. This lovely creation is God's creation, and for us to be destroying it, it's is an affront. Mr Kingston, a retired Bristol University social work lecturer who is now a regular at major XR protests, added: 'The God of love has given us all this, and we are just misusing it hopelessly. So that's why I'm here.' Police arrest Mr Kingston outside the Treasury building last Thursday after protesters sprayed fake blood on it\n\n'The flight departed at 11.16am and arrived in Dublin at 12.33pm. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.'\n\nAt the terminal, Victoria Bamford, 71, of Wales, chatted happily and smiled with officers as she waited to be put into a van. She said: 'I have been arrested before. It's nothing new to me. It's for all the children of the world.'\n\nAnother arrested woman was Ruth Collins, 80, of South Wales, who said: 'Airports are a major contribution to Co2 omissions and they need to be shut down. I am OK with being arrested. I am a bit shaken. But it is worth it.'\n\nAround 30 protesters sang songs supported by a trumpeter in front of the terminal and raised an XR flag. One managed to climb onto the terminal roof, sang songs and was cheered by his fellow demonstrators.\n\nThe activists are highlighting what they claim is the 'incompatibility' of the East London airport's planned expansion with meeting the Government's legally binding commitment to go net carbon neutral by 2050.\n\nPolice made several arrests as the group sat and chanted 'Fly today, gone tomorrow' in unison during the action, which included some people gluing themselves to the floor.\n\nThose arriving for flights were redirected to a second terminal entrance by security workers and were not allowed to enter the building without showing their boarding cards first.\n\nOne of XR's ringleaders Dr Vishal Chauhan, who gave up his job at a South London hospital to join XR, was arrested for allegedly obstructing the public highway.\n\nHe apologised to the arresting officer for 'inconveniencing' him as he was led away, and told MailOnline: 'Being arrested is a little price to pay against the enormous challenge of saving the planet.'\n\nOlympic gold medalist Etienne Stott was also arrested near City Airport. The canoeist, who won gold at London 2012, had hinted before XR launched their fortnight of campaigning that he was willing to be detained by police.\n\nHe had said being arrested for civil disobedience was 'one of the most powerful things you can do.' In an ITV interview he said: 'I have not quite decided and the police will probably find out at some point.\n\n'But I actually believe it is one of the most powerful things an individual can do to show people, 'I'm just a normal person, I'm a good person, I am prepared to do this because I believe it is so important. And this is perhaps the only way we can actually get people to listen. It is absolutely the sensible and responsible thing to be doing.'\n\nThursday's arrest was the second time he had been arrested while campaigning with ER. He was detained at a protest in April.\n\nAn activist who gave her name as Claire, 51, said: 'I don't know what's going to happen over the next few hours, but I do know that a number of people have come here, City Airport, today to make the statement that there are many areas of our lives that are going to have to change because of the climate crisis we've created, and one of them is flying. 'We can't carry on with life, with business as usual,' she said.\n\nClaire said she had not made up her mind about whether she would allow herself to be arrested, but was later led away by police officers.\n\nIn Westminster, tents and protesters had been cleared away from the roads leading into Parliament Square.\n\nBut the streets around Parliament and Whitehall remained closed to traffic, apart from cyclists, amid a heavy police presence in the area.\n\nAt Trafalgar Square, tents, banners with messages such as 'This is change' and a hearse still blocked the roads, and a protest camp occupied the pedestrian area of the square.\n\nMr Davies told MailOnline: 'I am deeply concerned by this organisation, that appears to be in favour of banning all flying, driving, meat-eating and industrial production within the next five years \u2013 something that would have a devastating impact on jobs and the economy and reduce us to a pre-industrial standard of living.\n\n'It seems to be spearheaded by affluent well-to-do people who have enjoyed the benefits of western civilisation and are now trying to impose their misguided views on everyone else through blackmail and mass inconvenience to hard-working people. I think there needs to be much tougher action taken against them.'\n\nMr Davies said he wanted new rules on protesters using vehicles as part of stunts, and more targeted arrests.\n\n'We need to get a bit cleverer about this. We are allowing a few thousand people to dictate terms to us. What they are asking for is ludicrous. They are holding a major capital city to ransom at the moment,' he added.\n\nPolice officers react as an activist, dressed in a suit, scales the roof above the entrance to London City Airport\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters with bicycles block a roundabout during a demonstration near London City Airport\n\nTwo people stand on roof above the entrance to London City Airport during the fourth day of demonstrations\n\nA man is removed by police officers after activists staged a 'Hong Kong style' blockage at City Airport\n\nA man is removed by police officers after activists staged a 'Hong Kong style' blockage at City Airport\n\nPolice carry away an Extinction Rebellion protester involved in the demonstration at London City Airport\n\nPolice officers try to free a man who has glued himself to the pavement outside City Airport in London\n\nActivists, dressed in a suits, scale the roof above the entrance to London City Airport during the protests\n\nSecurity staff try to get a man down from a shelter during the Extinction Rebellion protest at London City Airport\n\nActivists blockade the Docklands Light Rail station at London City Airport during the fourth day of demonstrations\n\nPolice officers guard the entrance to London City Airport yesterday morning as Extinction Rebellion activists demonstrate\n\nPolice officers detain veteran protester Phil Kingston during the demonstration at London City Airport\n\nActivists hold a sit-in outside the Docklands Light Rail station at London City Airport during the demonstrations\n\nMeanwhile Scotland Yard said they are unable to confirm how many demonstrators are being held in cells across the capital.\n\nWho has been charged in relation to the protests? There have been 842 arrests in connection with the ongoing Extinction Rebellion protests across London. Some 29 individuals have been charged with various offences including 'knowingly failing to comply with a condition imposed under Section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986', and obstructing a highway.

Those arrested but not charged have been released under investigation.\n\nMetropolitan Police deputy assistant commissioner Laurence Taylor said: 'Our policing plan is aimed at preventing criminal activity which poses a significant safety and security risk to the airport, and the thousands of passengers using it. We are determined to deal with protestors robustly but proportionately.\n\n'Targeting an airport and inconveniencing travellers in this way is wholly unacceptable and irresponsible.\n\n'The consequences of committing offences at airports are serious; individuals breaking the law are being, and will continue to be, arrested and prosecuted where appropriate.'\n\nExtinction Rebellion co-founder Gail Bradbrook spoke outside the airport terminal on Thursday afternoon as the number of protesters that remained at the site dwindled.\n\nSpeaking to PA news agency about the success of the demonstration, she said: 'I think the most important thing is that we are alerting the British people to the crisis that we're in and the threat to all the forms of business-as-usual.\n\n'We've had a lot of press here to talk about these issues and that is what our intention is.'\n\nAsked whether the remaining protesters should go home, she said: 'I don't know, I think we've made our point, but I'm not making that decision for other people.'\n\nThe Prime Minister's father Stanley Johnson has backed the tactics of the protesters. Mr Johnson Snr was asked if he supports the demonstrators occupying streets and their plans to chain themselves to parts of the airport.\n\n'I think we've got to take a fairly relaxed view on this,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'I don't think many of them are breaking the law. I believe that they are wedded to non-violence, to peaceful protest.'\n\nHe insisted that the crisis is one thing that unites the family, whose views over Brexit range wildly. 'If there's an issue that does unite us, I would say it's this environmental issue, climate change,' Mr Johnson said.\n\nLater, Extinction Rebellion founder co-founder Gail Bradbrook said: 'I think the most important thing is that we are alerting the British people to the crisis that we're in and the threat to all the forms of business-as-usual.\n\n'We've had a lot of press here to talk about these issues and that is what our intention is.'\n\nAsked whether the remaining protesters should go home, she said: 'I don't know, I think we've made our point, but I'm not making that decision for other people.'\n\nIn the early hours, dance music duo Orbital had played a DJ set to crowds of flag-waving environmentalists in Trafalgar Square amid claims that police were running out of cells in which to hold those they had detained since Monday.\n\nThe Met Police told MailOnline yesterday morning that this is 'not accurate' but was unable to say how many of the 800 arrested were still detained.
