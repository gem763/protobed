And this means you should all drop whatever you\u2019re doing now and dedicate the next 331 hours of your life to reminding yourself what an incredible series it was.\n\nAnd it was. The overwhelming majority of shows from the past 25 years would be dramatically different if it wasn\u2019t for ER. The murmured dialogue of The Sopranos and The Wire. The dramatic surge of Breaking Bad. The sheer spectacle of Game of Thrones. The breathless professional jargon of Line of Duty. All of them, in one way or another, owe a debt of thanks to ER.\n\nOf course, this might not be entirely evident when you first watch it. Stumble across the wrong episode and you might be bewildered by its sentimentality, or the ridiculous matinee-idol looks of its cast. But this is to be expected. Like other shows that were groundbreaking at the time, the wider culture has subsequently absorbed what made ER so great and spread it wide across everything it could. There are elements of ER in almost every TV programme you\u2019ve watched in the last 20 years.\n\nIf you really want to experience the about-turn that ER represented, perhaps it\u2019s best to spend the next 15 years of your life watching TV shows that were made before 1994. Take something like St Elsewhere, which ran for six years in the mid-1980s and was almost entirely made up of long, unbroken scenes where doctors wandered around aimlessly having long meandering conversations. For years, almost since the invention of the form, this is what television looked like.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In its glory days it was unstoppable \u2026 ER.

A building collapses within the first four minutes, sending the cast into a frenzy of quick-fire medical jargon as a jittery percussive score kicks in. Stretchers flood into the hospital. We see the walls and ceiling of the hospital from the viewpoint of a wheeled-in patient. Teams of doctors attend to multiple people, communicating in long streams of deep-cut hospital terminology, punctuated by short reassurances. It\u2019s a whirling, breathless sequence that leaves both the camera and the audience racing to keep up. When it finally comes to an end, shaking with tears after seven or eight minutes, everything else on television felt it came from another planet.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nobody was bigger than the show \u2026 Julianna Margulies and George Clooney in ER.

Although it would eventually succumb to a comfortable soapiness, the propulsive set-pieces are still remarkably sophisticated. They\u2019re not just technically impressive but, in their refusal to lead viewers by the hand, they laid the seeds for almost every show you love today. You couldn\u2019t just watch ER the old way, letting it flop across your eyes like wallpaper. You had to actively be a participant to get the most out of it.\n\nObviously it helped that it was pretty to look at. This was, after all, the show that launched George Clooney into the stratosphere. His character\u2019s charm, his heroism, his quiet heartbreak, his attraction to Carol Hathaway; it lined him up perfectly for a career as an A-lister. But while he attracted the lion\u2019s share of the attention, the cast was rammed with talent of his calibre. Anthony Edwards, Noah Wyle, Julianna Margulies, Eriq La Salle, Maria Bello, Alex Kingston, Parminder Nagra, Linda Cardellini and Angela Bassett all had stints on the series, and each had several chances to shine.\n\nBut none were bigger than the show itself. ER was basically copied into irrelevance within a decade, but in its glory days it was unstoppable. It was a show that lured Quentin Tarantino, fresh from the glow of winning an Oscar for Pulp Fiction, to direct an episode. It was the show that hired Ewan McGregor, then arguably the biggest movie star in the world, to appear in one episode. And this was in the 1990s. The line separating film and TV at that point was vast. Talent of Tarantino and McGregor\u2019s ilk would only cross it for something truly important. ER was that something.\n\n\u2022 ER is available in full on All4 now.", "description": "In 1994, the doctors and nurses crashed through the doors of County General to save patient after bloody patient \u2013 and save the world from all the tedious TV that came before!", "authors": ["Stuart Heritage"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/119620eaaac225221867528578e5bc73e3df3c84/0_491_1978_1187/master/1978.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=66ac0709cda026767e0757ddf43dbbd8", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
