A third of our workforce of veterans' they were heroes before the universe put on that. And they're forcing these laws to the best of their ability. But when you have people going out there knowing full well that. We don't want concentration camps. That ice doesn't put kids in cages. That were not Nazis. Enforcing a law and order signed by federal judge on this those kind that that's kind of language and that kind of rhetoric. That results. In people. Who may not be of them of sound mind doing things like. Shooting bullets into a nice facility in San Antonio Texas almost hitting one of my agents or trying to blow to detention facility. And hurt the individuals of their working in those facilities as well the detaining that are contained therein. Indeed much more useful.

They're being afforded their full due process rights while they're there they have access to attorneys. Full medical. If recreational and educational options all these things that we provide these individuals. While they're here and in the country in our care and custody. But not concentration camps we're not Nazis and it doesn't help anybody. Maybe a few in the political class that want to get some sound bites on on the nightly news. To do that when it does do is put our officers or risk. There should be no reason why any of our personnel are subjected to threats. For force in laws that congress holds.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "ICE Acting Director Matthew Albence says fervent political activism put his front-line agents at risk.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/190919_vod_ice_director_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
