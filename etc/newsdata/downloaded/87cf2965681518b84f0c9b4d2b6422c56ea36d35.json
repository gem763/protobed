No longer confined to a Friday night, lots of us enjoy cooking up a spicy storm in the kitchen any night of the week \u2013 and increasingly we\u2019re using specially designed kits to do so.\n\nThe cost, quality and ease of use of curry kits vary wildly, but their universal benefit is that it saves buying hoardes of different spices \u2013 which can be tricky to get hold of some cases \u2013 and hands you the perfectly measured amount of Kashmiri chilli, brown mustard seeds or fenugreek required for the recipe, with no waste.\n\nOf course, keen cooks could spend a happy hour or two knocking up their own version of butter chicken or beef rendang using a stuffed store cupboard of spices, or at the other end of the spectrum there are supermarket pastes and sauces that will provide you with a middling jalfrezi in about 20 minutes, but these kits fall into a separate sphere where the curious can create dishes well outside of their comfort zone with very little fuss and almost guaranteed success.\n\nTo be considered a \u201ckit\u201d we were looking for at least two components, though some had many more, along with steps to follow and actual cooking to do.\n\nWhether you\u2019re after a quick post-work supper or are game for a veritable banquet, there\u2019s a curry kit for that.\n\nWith more than a month of testing, 20 hours spent cooking and 28 different dishes, we\u2019ve put the best to the test and these are our hot picks.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice. This revenue helps to fund journalism across The Independent.\n\nBoom Kitchen pick 'n' mix flexible subscription: \u00a313 a month, Boom Kitchen\n\nFor anyone looking to recreate a British Indian curry house experience, this is where we\u2019d direct you. With varieties such as \"jalfrezi heatwave\", \"lady naga\" and \"karma korma\" to choose from, the kits contain three or four sachets of spice mixes, stocks, dried chillies or coconut and usually around four very easy steps to create a restaurant-quality meal for four. All the varieties are vegan friendly and though most kits suggest chicken as the main protein, further suggestions are available online.\n\nWe thought the \"jalfrezi heatwave\", which we made with lamb and a handful of other fresh ingredients, was terrific and really had that authentic je ne sais quois, which is often lacking from homemade curries. Though the spice blends mean you\u2019re not entirely sure of measurements to recreate dishes alone \u2013 it\u2019s not just whacking in a paste and frying \u2013 there is enough participation in the cooking process to make you proud of your achievement. Most of the dishes take around 25 minutes and can be purchased separately outside of the subscription model if you like, though we\u2019d highly recommend the pick\u2019n\u2019mix option and hosting a big curry night for all your friends.\n\nBuy now\n\nHari Hari 6 pack curry kit: \u00a320, Hari Hari\n\nHari Hari is a range of 10 Sri Lankan curry kits designed to help you create authentic curries based around one main ingredient; choose from courgette, pork, chicken, or prawn curries and add the handful of fresh extras (usually onion, ginger and coconut milk) to make healthy, aromatic dishes for around four people a time. Most packs contain three sachets of whole or ground spices imported from Sri Lanka and hand blended by Hari Hari creator Illana Smith, who is half Sri Lankan and grew up there. We thought the chicken curry was absolutely delicious with crowd-pleasing rich and warming spices tempered with the characteristic Sri Lankan coconut flavours and paired brilliantly with the green bean curry kit which provided a fresh and vibrant contrast. Sri Lankan curries are typically complex, so these spice kits offer a welcome introduction to cooking the cuisine; the adventurous could branch out to the hopper mixes available too.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe Spicery three month Friday night curry subscription: \u00a326, Not on the High Street\n\nThese were one of the first kits on the scene and they\u2019re still going very strong. The brand\u2019s MO is that you sign up for a monthly letterbox delivery of freshly ground and measured spices along with a recipe card and shopping list of the fresh ingredients required to create around four complementary dishes. Choose from themes like \u201cworld kitchen explorer\u201d, \u201cIndian restaurant favourites\u201d and the one we\u2019d recommend, \u201cFriday night curry discoverer\" which brings curries far and wide to your door \u2013 past examples include Japanese kuro curry with soy eggs and pickles, and Goan xacuti with pilau.\n\nWe made a heady, clove scented Zanzibari chicken biryani with date chutney, coconut dhal and chilli salt fruit which went down brilliantly on a Friday night with friends. Novice cooks may find juggling cooking three or four dishes at the same time daunting, but the recipes are simple and as long as you have a modest range of kitchen equipment (we needed a blender, for example) then you will be serving up exotic feast after feast in no time at all. Packaging is compostable and you can keep the cards and repurchase spice blends or buy your own to make your favourites again.\n\nBuy now\n\nTyga Two Month Indian meal kit subscription: \u00a321.98, Not on the High Street\n\nAnother letterbox subscription based kit, Tyga meal kits come in a slimline box containing spices in 12 handy mini pots by Tyga\u2019s Bangladeshi in-house chef to whip up two fresh Indian mains and two sides using the recipe card for eight people (we think more). The extra ingredients are the usual story: some lamb, tinned tomatoes, onion, and the recipes are failsafe. We made an aubergine and butternut squash dhansak that wowed an Indian neighbour, a simple mushroom bhaji, a smoky and filling black and green bean dopiaza, a zingy sweet potato saag and a cumin potato dish that tasted like far more than the sum of its parts. Meatier options currently include dishes like lamb biryani, chicken korma, Kerala pepper chicken or Malabar prawn and chilli-phobes will be pleased to hear you can add as little or as much as you\u2019d like to each dish. Again, the recipes are designed to complement each other and are best served banquet style, so be prepared to juggle a little during the cooking process.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe Spice Tailor fiery Goan curry: \u00a32.90, Sainsbury\u2019s\n\nThis range is prevalent in supermarkets and for good reason; offering a wide selection of Indian curries using pastes, marinades, spices for sprinkling and sometimes an accompanying chutni (Indian spelling) ready in as little as 10 minutes. We tried six kits in the range and were hugely impressed by the tasty daals which can be whipped up in five minutes thanks to the pre-cooked lentils, but the favourite we settled on was the fiery Goan curry with a distinctive tomatoey-vinegar base which required only one fresh ingredient purchase \u2013 we plumped for haddock \u2013 and had on the table in no time at all.\n\nEach kit has suggestions for a main ingredient such as chicken, prawns or vegetables (these kits are good for vegetarians) and inside there are variations on the recipe, encouraging you to add spinach, whole chillies or a crispy onion garnish should you have extra time. For a fast weeknight dinner these are a godsend and the end results certainly taste authentic on a level with many of the other dishes we made, but because you\u2019re using a paste and not doing much in the way of cooking or learning about how to use specific spices these may not be for keener cooks.\n\nBuy now\n\nHari Ghotra tikka masala: \u00a33.50, Hari Ghotra\n\nIndian chef and blogger Hari Ghotra has created a range of 12 popular curry house favourites \u2013 think bhuna, makhani, korma \u2013 in kit form comprising a number of mini spice bags ready to be ground, soaked or fried according to her instructions. Most recipes need a spice grinder/pestle and mortar and about half a dozen fresh ingredients to create the dish \u2013 a protein, then perhaps onion, ginger, yoghurt etc \u2013 and are a tad more time consuming than some of the other kits in this list, but they are very much worth it. We tried a few in the range, but were blown away by the success of our chicken tikka masala, which easily rivalled most curry houses\u2019 and outclassed previous time-consuming attempts at cooking the dish from scratch.\n\nThe depth of flavour and that hard-to-achieve smoky flavour combined with the classically rich and creamy masala was remarkable and we\u2019ll be purchasing this particular in bulk and avidly cooking our way through the rest of the range too. Another good one for vegetarians, as Hari suggests paneer, aubergine and other non-meat ingredients as the star of the show. Each kit also includes a QR code to watch Hari cooking the dish along with you.\n\nBuy now\n\nScotia Spice chicken curry kit: \u00a324.95, Scotia Spice\n\nFor the fully-invested curry lover, look to Scotia Spice for an education in how to use individual spices. This kit contains six recipes with essential spices and dried ingredients like lentils, but most valuably a guide to tasting individual spices and far more tips and techniques than others on the market, unsurprising when you consider this kit is born out of cookery school owner Yasmin McDonagh\u2019s determination to bring the Punjabi food of her childhood to the masses.\n\nThe recipes are easy to follow and mouth-wateringly delicious; we thought the chicken curry was exceptional (it\u2019s also great for kids if you are light-handed with the chilli) and loved the way Yasmin talks you through each step with handy hints. This kit would allow you to cook the dishes you loved again and again, and Yasmin has you measuring out the individual spices yourself so it\u2019s more hands-on than other pre-prepared version. Don\u2019t buy this expecting to recreate curry house dishes, this is proper Punjabi home cooking and we\u2019re sold.\n\nBuy now\n\nSpicentice Malaysian rendang: \u00a32.49, Spicentice\n\nBack in 1994 Spicentice founder Ketan Varu\u2019s mum used to send him recipes and spices as a student in the UK to remind him of home in India. The idea for Spicentice was born and now the meal kits span dishes from every continent including Greek souvlaki, jerk chicken and char siu ribs, but we\u2019re here to talk about the curries today which vary from Thai, Malay, Indian and far Eastern. The packs contain a few sachets of spices or marinades, shopping list for fresh ingredients (we needed beef, onion, garlic, coconut milk, ginger, limes and a few storecupboard bits) and four or five easy steps to follow. We thought the Malaysian rendang was really tasty with minimal prep aside from blending and frying, and we really enjoyed the family favourite \"Methi chicken\" pack too. Spicentice market themselves as being largely low calorie, should you care, too. We\u2019d happily purchase again and work our way through some of the more unusual kits and rubs.\n\nBuy now\n\nWaitrose Cooks Ingredients massaman Thai curry meal kit: \u00a33.50, Waitrose\n\nFrankly many of the supermarket-own or mass market kits have been mediocre, but this one stood out to us. For \u00a33.50 and requiring only two further ingredients purchases (beef or duck and a potato), this kit feels like great value and the flavour was far better then a. we\u2019d expected and b. than some of the specialist Thai kits we\u2019d tried. The box contains a standard massaman paste, a packet of whole spices, some handy creamed coconut milk and cashews for sprinkling. There are only three cooking steps and the whole thing is done and dusted after 25 minutes: just add rice for a brilliant commitment-free weeknight dinner, though you might like to throw in some greenery for balance. Again, not one for anyone looking for lessons in how to create a curry from scratch.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Curry kits\n\nBoom Kitchen\u2019s offering stands out for the value, ease of use and the incredible flavours of the curries themselves, but the competition really was tough and we were impressed with all the dishes we tried during testing. Curry is such a broad spectrum, and while Boom Kitchen allow you to recreate Indian restaurant style dishes, we also fell hard for the Punjabi home cooking style of Scotia Spice, and the exotic and complex flavours we created using Hari Hari\u2019s Sri Lankan dishes. For those willing to spend more and those truly committed to the curry cause, we\u2019d highly recommend signing up to The Spicery or Tyga, especially if you enjoy cooking for groups of people. Whatever your skills in the kitchen, the plethora of excellent curry kits mean it\u2019s never been easier to spice up your life.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
