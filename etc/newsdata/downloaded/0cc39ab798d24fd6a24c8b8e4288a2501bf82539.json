REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he would nominate Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, a former vice president of Ford Motor Co and Louisiana state energy regulator, to head the department.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to nominate Deputy Secretary Dan Brouillette to be the new Secretary of Energy,\u201d Trump wrote in a post on Twitter. \u201cDan\u2019s experience in the sector is unparalleled. A total professional, I have no doubt that Dan will do a great job!\u201d\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Brouillette will replace Rick Perry, who said on Thursday he would step down by the end of the year.\n\nBrouillette, 57, has taken on increasing responsibilities at the Energy Department in recent months as Perry signaled he would resign. He went on international trips for the department and sat in for Perry during several Cabinet meetings.\n\nBrouillette was vice president at Ford (F.N) from 2004 to 2006. After that, he headed public policy for United Service Automobile Association (USAA) which offers insurance and financial services to veterans.\n\nA native of Louisiana, he was a member of the state\u2019s Mineral and Energy Board from 2013 to 2016. Before that he served at the Energy Department as an assistant secretary for congressional and intergovernmental affairs for two years under former President George W. Bush.\n\nJoe McMonigle, who was a department chief of staff under Bush, said Brouillette does not have the instincts of a politician like Perry, who had been the longest-serving governor of Texas. But like Perry, Brouillette has an easy relationship with many Democratic and Republican lawmakers, McMonigle said.\n\nBrouillette, who met with Trump on Friday, is expected to keep pushing the president\u2019s policy of maximizing oil, gas and coal output while slashing regulations on energy facilities.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of a single issue where he differs from the president,\u201d McMonigle said.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he would nominate Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, a former vice president of Ford Motor Co and Louisiana state energy regulator, to head the department.", "authors": ["Timothy Gardner", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442439534&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H21C", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
