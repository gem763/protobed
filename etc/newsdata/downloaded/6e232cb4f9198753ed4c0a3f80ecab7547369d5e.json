Senators want that threat information made available to other branches of government.\n\n\u201cBoth Congress and the Executive branch have devoted considerable time identifying ways to enhance the supply chain security of information and communications technology (ICT) on U.S. government systems,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cThe work is vitally important, but executive agency solutions do not always mean whole of government solutions.\u201d\n\nThe senators emphasized that \u201cthe government must ensure that information used to secure executive agency computer systems and networks is shared with ICT professionals in Congress and the judiciary.\u201d\n\nThe FASC was established by a bill signed into law late last year by President Trump Donald John TrumpDemocrats request testimony from Trump's former Russia adviser Trump adviser: 'He should stop saying things that are untrue' US moves British ISIS suspects from Syria amid Turkish invasion MORE.

The order blocked foreign tech companies deemed national security threats from doing business in the U.S.\n\nWhile the executive order did not mention any companies by name, the Commerce Department added Huawei to its \u201centity list\u201d a short time later. U.S. companies are prohibited from doing business with companies on the list.\n\nThe Commerce Department has since pushed back Huawei\u2019s addition to the list until Nov. 19, to give U.S. companies more time to prepare.\n\nSeveral congressional committees have been examining supply chain security recently. The House Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing last month to discuss proposed legislation meant to \u201csecure America\u2019s wireless future,\u201d and the House Homeland Security Committee is set to hold a hearing Wednesday that will focus on how \u201cpublic-private partnerships\u201d can enhance the security of the supply chain.", "description": "A bipartisan group of senators\u00a0is calling for all branches of government to share information on threats to technology supply chains, citing potential risks to national security.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/supply_chain_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
