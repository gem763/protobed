Many of them also wanted to knock him out, and that was the secret of his success. Kaufman was not content with his clever appearances on SNL, or as Latka, the cutie pie he played on the hit TV show, Taxi. He didn\u2019t even think of himself as a comedian. He was more of a performance artist. His friend Robin Williams once said, \u201cKaufman\u2019s like a squirrel going over the Grand Canyon saying, \u2018Give up the nuts or die.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the early \u201980s, Kaufman was the most daring, avant garde, and obnoxious performer in the country. His famed antics\u2014wrestling women, his evil alter-ego, Tony Clifton\u2014were captured with wit and flair by David Hirshey in \u201cBeyond Laughter.\u201d It was originally published in the April 1981 issue of Rolling Stone and is reprinted here with the author\u2019s permission. Please enjoy this wild ride with one of our most legendary performers.\n\n\u2014Alex Belth\n\nOut of the blue, in the middle of the action, an extremely clever comic actor began counting, very slowly, and with great concentration: one, two, three, four\u2026 enunciating each of the numbers with the utmost deliberation, as if they had gotten away from him and he was gathering them up again: five, six, seven, eight\u2026 .\n\nWhen he reached fifteen, the audience began to laugh, and by the time he had slowly, and with greater and greater concentration, made his way up to a hundred, people were falling off their seats\u2026 .\n\nYes, cross the border and you hear that fateful laughter. And if you go farther, beyond laughter?\n\n\u2014Milan Kundera, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting\n\nIt is 1:50 on a weekday morning as Andy Kaufman strides into the Improvisation. This is the New York comedy showcase where Kaufman used to be the \u201chouse weirdo,\u201d ordering meals and eating them onstage, playing kiddie records, showing home movies, doing everything but telling real jokes. He insists he has never told a real joke onstage. Not on any stage. He just, well, does things\u2026\n\nIt has already been a good night for Kaufman. Earlier, he was recognized by a gaggle of pimps in Fascination, a sleazy slice of electronic video-game heaven just off Times Square. Then, riding here in a hansom cab, the driver, a pretty brunette, claimed to be a fan of his from Saturday Night Live. \u201cI read where you gave a show at Carnegie Hall and took the audience out for milk and cookies,\u201d she said. Andy smiled shyly. \u201cUh-huh. In 1982, I hope to take an audience around the world in an ocean liner. Wanna come?\u201d\n\nBy 1982, Kaufman figures to need a restful cruise. This year, he plans to complete his third novel (none published), which he describes as \u201cthe story of a man\u2019s life from start to finish.\u201d When ABC\u2019s hit sitcom Taxi (he plays the timid but sex-crazed immigrant mechanic Latka Gravas) lets out for the summer, he\u2019d like to make a ninety-nine-cent national tour \u201cso everybody can afford to see me.\u201d Heartbeeps, in which he costars with Bernadette Peters, will be released later in the year, and he hopes to wrap up a screenplay, The Tony Clifton Story, for Universal. Clifton, a frog-voiced Las Vegas lounge lizard, is the strangest of Kaufman\u2019s strange creations.\n\nInside the Improv, a male-female comedy team is flailing away in front of a small group of bemused conventioneers. The help is getting out the brooms and mops. Finally, the act finishes. Kaufman wanders onstage and begins lamely sing-songing, accompanied by tiny, mock-festive hops: \u201cA hundred bottles of beer on the wall, a hunnerd bottles of beer \u2026\u201d The audience titters. At ninety-two bottles of beer, chuckles. By seventy-seven, worried glances. Is he really going all the way? The voices change as he starts doing impressions. But the song goes on. George C. Scott sings \u201cSixty-six bottles of beer on the wall, sixty-six bottles of beer.\u201d Elvis takes us down to fifty-three. Then Kaufman increases the pressure by counting back up for a few bottles, whispering a little, now singing again. Groans and face-rubbing. A few halfhearted boos. No matter. He rolls on. The bartender cracks ice, A phone rings. The crowd is silent now, mesmerized. \u201cForty-one bottles of beer\u2026 .\u201d\n\nTwo men cover their ears; two others start clapping. One of the regular young comics is down on his knees in front of the stage: \u201cDon\u2019t stop, Andy, I\u2019m gonna cum.\u201d Andy massages the cadence\u2014faster, then slower, then faster again. At fourteen bottles of beer on the wall, he leaves the stage. Suddenly, six people are screaming, \u201cDon\u2019t stop. Please, Andy, do it.\u201d\n\nApplause erupts when he returns and completes the ordeal. He struts offstage, pumping his arms like Bruce Jenner in a Wheaties commercial. He\u2019s euphoric. \u201cThat was magical,\u201d he says in childlike tones as he treats us to ice cream in an all-night deli. \u201c'A Hundred Bottles of Beer\u2019 has always been a fantasy of mine. But there\u2019s a little voice that says, \u2018Oh, no, you can\u2019t do that, that\u2019s breaking all the rules.\u2019 That\u2019s the voice of show business. Then this other little voice says, \u2018Try it.\u2019 And most of the time, when the voice comes on and says, \u2018No,\u2019 that\u2019s the time it works.\u201d He is speechless for a moment. \u201cThere are such psychological implications to that song, such great things you can do. Once they\u2019re hooked, they won\u2019t let you stop. Can you imagine?\u201d\n\nYou want to be happy for him, this overgrown child, but something holds you back. Yes, almost all of Kaufman\u2019s bits work. Once. He has stumbled onto a secret of comedy: the unexpected is funny. And what could be more unexpected than a comedian coming out for ten minutes and not being funny at all? The problem becomes what to do the next time, when everyone expects you not to be funny for ten minutes. Kaufman\u2019s solution to this problem is not to be funny for twenty minutes, and then for forty minutes. But it doesn\u2019t take a profound comic mind to see where that is leading. Only Kaufman doesn\u2019t seem to notice.\n\n\u201cAnd when I get them,\u201d he says, his voice, breathless, rising higher, \u201cand they ask for an encore\u2026 .\u201d The eyes are glazed. \u201cOkay, folks, a thousand bottles of beer on the wall.\u201d\n\nBeyond laughter. That space past \u201cintellectual\u201d comedy, an uncharted area in which network executives fear to tread, that\u2019s where Andy Kaufman feels most comfortable. Since he began simulating heart attacks in concert and wrestling women on Saturday Night Live two years ago, the networks have become wary. The special he did for ABC spent two years in the can before being aired because, Andy will tell you, Fred Silverman, then at ABC, was convinced Kaufman was crazy. \u201cI\u2019m not being paranoid,\u201d Andy says. \u201cEvery time my manager approached big network executives or even cable, they told him I was too dangerous. They couldn\u2019t trust me.\u201d\n\nCould it have been the hundreds of hate letters the SNL wrestling generated? Perhaps it was the stubborn rumor that, disguised as Tony Clifton, he threw eggs at Dinah Shore. Maybe they heard about his brief flirtation with levitation. \u201cFor a while there, he was planning to close his act with that,\u201d says Bob Zmuda, a writing and performing partner. \u201cHe took a month off \u2018to learn how to fly.\u2019\u201d Or maybe word got out about that unscheduled appearance he made early one morning on the late, lamented David Letterman Show. Uncombed and untucked, Andy walked onstage with a trail of Vaseline smeared from nostril to lip to simulate mucus; it melted and dripped under the lights as he began to mumble disconsolately:\n\n\u201cUmmm\u2026 I\u2019d like to talk about my wife.\u2026 I met her several years ago while I was struggling\u2026 performing at the Improvisation. I could perform for free. Elsewhere I would get jobs for fifty dollars and stuff\u2026 and I met her while I was driving up from southern New Jersey. She was a cocktail waitress and we went out a few times and we got married and she worked as a waitress while I was working for free in clubs and we had two children and their names were Mark and Lisa [hacking cough]\u2026 and when Saturday Night Live discovered me\u2014I\u2019d rather if you don\u2019t laugh because I\u2019m not trying to be funny right now\u2014shortly after that I went to California and things really started happening\u2026 and then Taxi came along and I was doing all these far-out things on television and it was just my character Latka. I kind of felt inhibited\u2026 uh\u2026 so anyway I quit the show and at that time I was wrestling women on Saturday Night Live and I got a lot of hate mail and no producer would hire me\u2026 and so one day I was at my manager\u2019s trying to get an engagement for dinner theater in Wisconsin\u2026 and I got a call from my wife\u2019s lawyer. She wanted a divorce and she got a divorce and the kids, the house, everything. I don\u2019t have any money myself but at any rate\u2026 I know this sounds slightly clich\u00e9d, but if you could\u2026 uh \u2026any extra money\u2026 I would appreciate\u2026 .\u201d (Fade out on Andy panhandling the audience.)\n\n\u201cWe got an instant reaction to that show,\u201d Letterman recalls. \u201cPhone calls, letters. People were mad at me for having him on, mad at him, sorry for his plight. Other people thought I had not been sympathetic to the needs of this obviously desperate human.\u201d\n\nAnd Andy? \u201cHe was real eager to get the hate mail,\u201d says Letterman. \u201cHe made me promise to send it.\u201d He pauses. \u201cSometimes, when you look Andy in the eyes, you get a feeling somebody else is driving.\u201d\n\nThe story has been circulating around New York clubs of a woman who wasn\u2019t sure just which Andy Kaufman she had brought home on their first and only date.\n\n\u201cWho do you want me to be?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYourself,\u201d she said.\n\nWhereupon Kaufman launched into his Foreign Man, gibbering away madly in some impossible accent that sounded like it might be meant for the fish in the Caspian Sea. Then he transformed himself into Elvis Presley. He ended the evening as that bleating boor, Tony Clifton.\n\n\u201cIt was like there was no real Andy Kaufman,\u201d she says now.\n\nThe \u201creal Andy,\u201d I\u2019m told, is off \u201csomewhere on vacation, possibly in Los Angeles.\u201d But one of his after egos is performing at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco, so I go to see him.\n\n\u201cRodney Dangerfield,\u201d the marquee reads, \u201cThree Nights, Two Shows Per.\u201d And in equal-sized letters: \u201cTony Clifton.\u201d\n\nTony and I have never met, although I saw him perform with Andy at Carnegie Hall in 1979. At least I think I did. Andy Kaufman and I have met several times, and on each occasion he has taken great care to point out that he is not the singer Tony Clifton. Oh, sure, he used to do a Tony Clifton imitation. But Andy insists that the act was modeled on a real-life Tony Clifton, whom he discovered in Las Vegas in 1971. Clifton was an atrocious happy-hour gargoyle with pipes so bad he could make dogs yelp in pain. Audiences demanded his head for an encore. Inspired, Andy got himself some dime-store makeup, a bad wig, sunglasses and a peach-flocked tuxedo jacket with a bordello-parlor pattern, and worked the bit into his club act. Now that he can afford to pay for an opening act, he says, he stopped doing the imitation and hired the real thing, the original Tony Clifton. Andy says he is glad to help the guy\u2019s career, but sick of taking raps for his bad behavior. \u201cClifton and I don\u2019t even look alike,\u201d he says. \u201cHe smokes and drinks and I do neither. He\u2019s a big fat guy, and if it weren\u2019t for me, no one would know who he is.\u201d\n\nA random sampling of ticket holders outside the Warfield suggests that a lot of people still don\u2019t know who Tony Clifton is.\n\n\u201cClifton? Who? I dunno.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he local or what?\u201d\n\nSomeone on the staff of promoter Bill Graham, who booked the show, seemingly had the same problem. The headline on the glass billboard says: \u201cExtra Extra Extra. Tony Clifton, Who Is He?\u201d\n\nTepid applause greets Clifton\u2019s first appearance onstage, but as he swings into his act, it turns into a shower of abuse. He looks like Roy Orbison pumped with cortisone; a swollen gut strains at his blue ruffled shirt The hip Bay Area rock and Rotary Club crowd isn\u2019t getting this Vegas sign language. They squirm in their seats as he punches out note after ungodly note of \u201cI Left My Heart in San Francisco.\u201d\n\nTake the dogshit out of your mouth is the first piece of advice from the crowd as he wails, \u201cHi-yi-yi-yi on a hill, it calls to meeeee.\u201d\n\nFuck you. Get the hook. We want Rodney.\n\nTony takes it well: \u201cShaddap. Why don\u2019t you go home and drink a beer and watch football?\u201d And to a front-row heckler: \u201cI\u2019m gonna push yer face through the seat.\u201d\n\nThe ensuing outrage is reminiscent of the hair-pulling, eye-gouging, chair-throwing Monday evenings of wrestling at the Suffolk Forum on Long Island in the late \u201950s\u2014evenings that Andy Kaufman, his brother, Michael, and his father, Stanley, rarely missed. Too bad Andy Kaufman isn\u2019t here with Tony Clifton tonight. This jeering, seething mob would have brought back delicious memories.\n\nIn a burst of inspiration, Clifton calls for audience volunteers, and ten guys clamber onstage, blurting their names into the mike as he lines them up. The last volunteer is a Vitalis-drenched pudgeball in white patent shoes and a matching belt that bisects his girth like a sagging equator. I recognize Bob Zmuda, Kaufman\u2019s cohort.\n\n\u201cBob Gorski,\u201d Zmuda murmurs into the mike.\n\n\u201cGor-Ski? Ski? Ski?\u201d Clifton launches into a swamp of obnoxious Polish jokes and insults. Poor Bob is looking pathetic, sniffling, picking his nails, staring at his shoes.\n\nLeave Bob Alone, the chant goes up. And when Clifton boots his hapless victim offstage, We want Bob. Clifton softens, inviting Gorski back. The pudgy man is beaming now, basking in the applause, finally at ease. Then Clifton dumps a glass of water on his head.\n\nKill the son of a bitch. Kill him.\n\nFrom the balcony comes a rain of garbage. Clifton threatens to stay on forever, goading the audience: \u201cYou paid fifteen bucks for this.\u201d Later, twenty fans demand, and get, refunds. After the show, Clifton is still bellowing in his dressing room, vowing, \u201cI\u2019ll punish those people for not letting me sing my songs.\u201d\n\nI knock on Clifton\u2019s door, which is opened by Kaufman\u2019s manager, George Shapiro. I see that Clifton has taken off his shirt, and with it, about sixty pounds.\n\n\u201cYou must really sweat out there,\u201d I observe.\n\n\u201cWho is this?!\u201d he shrieks. \u201cGet him out of here.\u201d\n\nI introduce myself as a writer friend of his friend, Andy Kaufman.\n\n\u201cGet out of here. I\u2019m sick of you writers and your exposes.\u201d\n\nLater, we meet for dinner. Clifton has never heard of this \u201cBowling Green\u201d magazine but figures he can use the ink. Promises to pose for a cover if that bozo, Kough-man, stays off it. I know from past experience that Kaufman has a fondness for Japanese food, and so does Clifton. But when we arrive at the Hilton\u2019s Kiku of Tokyo restaurant, he immediately berates the ma\u00eetre d\u2019: \u201cI wanna room with chairs. I don\u2019t sit on floors, pal.\u201d\n\nKaufman had told me back in New York that he had agreed to sign a contract for Taxi only if Tony Clifton was signed as well. Sitcoms are dumb. Andy doesn\u2019t even own a TV But to help Tony\u2026\n\n\u201cIf they hadn\u2019t thrown me off,\u201d Tony honks, \u201cI woulda been the star. I had a bigger trailer than Judd Hirsch\u2019s. So what if I had girls in the trailer? So what if I was onstage with a girl on each knee? So what if I was up all night rewriting the show to include these two girls?\u201d\n\nThese two girls, it turns out, were the working type. Another acquired taste Clifton and Kaufman seem to have in common.\n\n\u201cOh, Andy has a whole theory on prostitutes,\u201d says Alan Arkush, who recently directed Kaufman as the robot star of Heartbeeps. \u201cHe\u2019s a real champion of theirs, and he believes in meaningful relationships with them.\u201d The subject first came up, Arkush says, when he asked Andy how he spent his time off. \u201cI spent my vacation at the Mustang Ranch, every night,\u201d Kaufman told him.\n\nLater, Kaufman would prepare a curiously diplomatic response when I ask about his preference for flesh parlors. \u201cOne of the girls from the Mustang Ranch came to see my show when I was playing Reno. We became friends, and when I had a week off, I went to see her. I don\u2019t have any prejudice against anybody because of what business they\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nClifton isn\u2019t quite as touchy on the subject. \u201cI want a woman,\u201d he bawls as we leave the Japanese restaurant. \u201cLast night I had two of them, just like a ham sandwich. I was the ham, they were the bread. You dig what I\u2019m putting down?\u201d\n\nBy the next night, word is out. And if anybody is still unsure, Clifton provides the strongest evidence with his loud denials. Holding aloft a copy of that morning\u2019s San Francisco Examiner, he reads from a story that claims Andy Kaufman has used the name Tony Clifton as an alias. \u201cI am fed up with all the rumors that I am connected with the comedian. I am suing the writer of the story, and the San Francisco Examiner, and I am suing Andy Kough-man. He\u2019s in Hollywood. Mr. Hollywood. He thinks he\u2019s a big star. But he\u2019s gonna come up here and be on the stage with me tomorrow night and we\u2019ll straighten the whole thing out. And if he doesn\u2019t, I will sue him.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re Kaufman, you son of a bitch, comes a bloodcurdling cry from the balcony. And you\u2019re a rip-off.\n\nClifton roars back: \u201cIf I hear one more person call out that guy\u2019s name, I\u2019ll sue you, too.\u201d\n\nYour mother!\n\n\u201cNo, your mother. Yah mothah, pal.\u201d\n\nJust then a tiny old German man in a gold blazer stalks onstage waving a pearl-handled penknife. He gets to within two feet of Clifton before he\u2019s noticed.\n\nI can\u2019t take it. Now get ze hell off!\n\n\u201cGet your hands off me!\u201d Clifton screeches, and security hustles the man away. I catch up with the guy in the lobby and find, to my astonishment, that he is not a plant. He\u2019s just driven forty miles from Sunnyvale to see Dangerfield, and Clifton has pushed him to this desperate act.\n\nAfter the incident, Clifton is more obnoxious than ever, braying at his audience, taunting them. A full can of Coors explodes behind him. Clifton ignores it. But when a half-pint of Southern Comfort misses him by a foot, he realizes he has stepped over that blurred line between theatrics and real danger.\n\n\u201cThat was a glass bottle, and you\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 asshole!\u201d Clifton shouts before taking refuge behind the curtain. Incredibly, he refuses to surrender, belting out three more songs from the wings while the lighting director continues his cues as though Clifton were still onstage. He sings \u201cLove Makes the World Go Round.\u201d The hall resounds with boos and catcalls.\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019t that wonderfully surreal?\u201d asks Bob Zmuda, alias Bob Gorski, the next afternoon. \u201cAndy\u2019s like a little kid who wants to scare people and wants people to scare him\u2014but it\u2019s just fun and games. Andy Kaufman is a fraidy cat. Every night he looks in his closet for the bogyman.\u201d\n\nWhich is why Tony Clifton will perform his last two shows wearing a SWAT helmet cadged from the municipal riot squad and standing behind a triple-folded curtain of industrial fishnet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shit booking, anyhow,\u201d says Zmuda. \u201cA buncha animals out there: Did you see Tony Clifton on The Midnight Special? Well, you saw, they got it perfectly.\u201d\n\nClifton is twenty-five minutes late for his final night\u2019s first show. It is announced that the performance will not start until all cigarettes are extinguished. Once they are, Tony Clifton swaggers onstage and lights one up. BOOOOOOOOO. Unfazed, he launches into a cat-in-heat version of \u201cMy Way.\u201d Spotting a guy in front cocking his arm to fire a tomato. Clifton challenges him: \u201cC'mon up here, ya slimy chicken.\u201d A tomato splatters at his feet as he menaces the audience. He swats away a paper cup but a piece of banana cake splats across his shoulder and an egg bounces off his shoe. \u201cDrop the net,\u201d Clifton barks to a stagehand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to dedicate this song to the hostages \u2026\u201d\n\nThey should take you hostage.\n\n\u201cYankee Doodle went to town, riding on a pony \u2026\u201d\n\nYou suck.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put our hands together for the hostages,\u201d Clifton exhorts. A coin whizzes by his ear. \u201cGive me the helmet!\n\n\u201cStuck a finger in his ear and called it macaroni \u2026\u201d In the balcony, a brawny teenager lets fly with a fat red apple that rips through the netting, smacks into the center of the helmet and sends Clifton reeling. The crowd roars. Even Clifton seems terrified now. He finishes his show screaming from the wings and leaves Bill Graham and crew to contend with the slop.\n\nGraham has never seen anything like it. The Sex Pistols weren\u2019t this bad. He is disgusted and sorry he agreed to the booking, which was sold to him as a package. (\u201cYou want Dangerfield? You have to take Clifton, too.\u201d) \u201cWhat really bothers me is the guy\u2019s mind,\u201d says Graham, who is standing in the drab downstairs corridor, looking as ashen as his slate-gray velvet suit. \u201cI know what this reminds me of,\u201d he says. \u201cThe night I had to throw some guy out of my theater for pissing in the middle of the dance floor.\u201d\n\nDown the hall, Clifton is ebullient, scampering in and out of his dressing room, calling the night a great success. \u201cYou know what I did tonight, you know what I did? I sang \u2018A Hundred Bottles of Beer.\u2019 I\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026 I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever done that in the history of show business.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw Andy Kaufman do it once,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? Get out. You\u2019re lyin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw him do it at three a.m. at the Improv.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? Shut up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw him do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m the first one ever to do that song. If he did it, then he stole it from me.\u201d\n\nI turn to leave. \u201cWatch yerself!\u201d he screams. \u201cYou print that I\u2019m Andy Kough-man and I\u2019ll sue yer ass! I\u2019ll sue Bowling Green\u2019s ass!\u201d\n\nAndy\u2019s mom, Janice Kaufman, is fixing snacks. We\u2019re in the kitchen of her red brick split-level in an affluent suburb of Great Neck, Long Island. Of her three children\u2014Michael, Carol and Andy\u2014she acknowledges that Andy would have to be considered the Problem Child. Andy was a loner from the start, a spacey kid who refused to participate in team sports. At school, teachers complained of his lack of attention. From age four on, psychologists and psychiatrists probed at his curious psyche. But looking back now, Janice thinks that little wide-eyed Andy was putting them all on.\n\n\u201cHe had a little kiddie phonograph on the dresser, and he\u2019d stand up in his crib and keep it on all the time, just putting the needle back,\u201d his mother remembers.\n\n\u201cWhenever it was on, he was totally content.\u201d\n\nAndy\u2019s interest in being a DJ-emcee grew with his sneaker size, until by junior high he was regularly working children\u2019s parties. He wrote, too. He completed his first novel, The Hollering Mangoo, when he was sixteen. \u201cHe had an unusual style, kind of like Joyce\u2019s in Ulysses,\u201d offers Stanley, a graying version of his son in dark-rimmed glasses. \u201cOnce, in a story when a character had to laugh, Andy wrote an entire page of him laughing. Ha ha, hee hee, tee hee, ho ho. All the laugh sounds filled the page. I couldn\u2019t believe anyone would sit through it, but when he read it aloud, everyone was hysterical at the end.\u201d\n\nEven then, says Stanley, it was unusual laughter\u2014doubting, confused, a little strained. Not that Andy seemed to be trying to make people laugh. Andy was a very earnest child, especially when it came to wrestling.\n\nHe still is. Kaufman said recently, in apparent seriousness, \u201cIf I play my cards right, I could bring network wrestling back to TV. Unfortunately, to most people, wrestling is a laughingstock. But fortunately, I\u2019m reaching people who otherwise wouldn\u2019t watch it.\u201d\n\nAndy\u2019s father sees his son\u2019s current obsession with wrestling women as a direct outgrowth of his failure in team sports. But he has no ready theory that might explain Tony Clifton.\n\n\u201cI never understood why he would want to alienate the audience to such extremes,\u201d says Stanley, \u201cunless he was trying to get them to go from hate to love. Why Tony Clifton? It\u2019s possible he created this character to draw hisses for the villain so he can come out the hero.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s Andy\u2019s design, it\u2019s working only for him. Witness a bizarre episode on a recent Fridays telecast, which he was guest hosting. In the middle of the show\u2019s last skit\u2014about dope smoking\u2014Kaufman suddenly refused, on-camera, to play his part. He said he \u201cfelt stupid\u201d acting stoned. Everybody freaked. Fridays regular Michael Richards dumped the cue cards. Kaufman spilled a glass of water on Richards. Actress Melanie Chartoff fired some breakfast rolls at Kaufman and followed up with a pat of butter to the head. Yelling, \u201cCut to a commercial, cut to a commercial,\u201d co-producer Jack Burns rushed onstage to take a few futile swings at Kaufman. Finally, they did go to a commercial. When they cut back, Kaufman was still shoving and jawing with the cast. Fridays' Brandis Kemp signed off with:\n\n\u201cI want to thank the portion of Andy Kaufman who was with us tonight.\u201d\n\nThe following Friday, Kaufman came on the show to \u201cclarify\u201d the situation. Looking just as he had on Letterman\u2019s show\u2014unshaven, sweating, bleary-eyed\u2014he haltingly explained: \u201cIt was an experimental piece\u2026 something different. This has been a very hard week for me. Because of last week\u2019s show, my job at Taxi is in jeopardy\u2026 my agent is having trouble convincing anybody to hire me. I think you laughing at it is pretty tasteless. Thanks to last week, I\u2019m in a separation with my wife\u2026 I was just trying to have fun.\u201d Kaufman looked as if he were about to cry. The screen went blank.\n\nWas it reality or Son of Tony Clifton? Even his family didn\u2019t know for sure. One confused witness to the first Fridays fiasco was Kaufman\u2019s brother, Michael. He\u2019s a thirty-year-old CPA who recently moved to Los Angeles, ten minutes away from Andy, and who once did what much of America has been longing to do: he broke Andy\u2019s neck. \u201cI was about four and Andy was about five,\u201d Michael recalls. \u201cIt was Andy\u2019s first official wrestling match. I got him in a headlock and something snapped, I guess.\n\n\u201cI fell for the bit,\u201d Michael says of the Fridays episode. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was staged until Andy and Jack Burns came out after the show and told the studio audience. Tremendous acting job. But even if it had turned out that Andy really screwed up and pissed them all off, I would have liked that, too. Just because it was different. I think it may be the best thing Andy\u2019s ever done.\u201d\n\nCarol Kaufman has her doubts. Despite their age difference\u2014Carol is twenty-five, Andy is thirty-one\u2014she is probably closer to Andy than anyone in the family. As children, they would act out show-business fantasies in the den, blowing lines in front of imaginary thousands. In those days, Carol was always in on the joke. \u201cI don\u2019t think Fridays was entertainment to the average person,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think Tony Clifton is entertainment to the average person. I don\u2019t think anything that makes people uncomfortable is entertainment. Sometimes I just want to stand up on my seat and shout, \u2018He\u2019s only kidding, everybody.\u2019 I think with Andy, it all goes back to the self, the I. What am I going to get pleasure out of, not how am I going to please the audience. He knows they want to laugh, they want him to tell jokes. But no. That would be selfless. Not that I\u2019m calling him selfish, really. To a point, yeah, sure. He\u2019s got to enjoy what he\u2019s doing and not sell himself short. I think there\u2019s something beautiful in that\u2014taking risks like he did on Fridays. I wish my parents could appreciate it I called them the next morning, and they said, \u2018What is Andy trying to do, ruin his career?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Andy\u2019s parents have generally indulged their son the comedian. Stanley put his foot down only once, when the owner of a Times Square freak show, Conga the Jungle Creep, offered to put Andy and his very original poetry on his bill. Next to Coney Island, it was the place Andy loved most in the world. From the time he was ten until the show closed seven years later, Andy gloried in double-talking with Phil Dirks, the man with three eyes, two noses and a pair of mouths. And the Elephant Woman, whose body was covered with folds of scaly gray skin. They liked Andy there. The serpentine Princess Wago would drape her six-foot boa around Andy\u2019s neck to impress onlookers. Kaufman developed a carny sensibility that persists to this day. He says he based his wrestling routine on the traveling grapplers who would challenge yokels in every town. He remains very attached to his childhood memorabilia, collected in midways and two-bit candy stores.\n\nA tiny maid\u2019s room in the basement of his parents\u2019 house is crammed with pop-culture landfill. Behind a pair of congas and one cracked bongo\u2014tied together with dirty sheets and several peeling leatherette belts\u2014is his record collection, which includes Mambo Mania, Margaret Whiting, the Lennon Sisters, and New Music of the Philippines. In the library: hundreds of wrestling magazines dating back to the \u201950s, Captain America comics, The Incredible Hulk vs. the Thing, the works of Jerzy Kosinski, a dog-eared copy of The Sensuous Man and How to Win Friends and Influence People. The iconography is chiefly Elvis. (Since 1969, when he first saw him in Vegas, Kaufman has done a sneeringly accurate impersonation of his idol. It\u2019s the closest thing to a normal routine in his act.)\n\nTo his parents, Andy has always been a \u201cgood boy.\u201d Very devoted to his grandmother in Florida. Bought her a color TV with remote controls as soon as he started making money. Has taped hours of conversations with her that he\u2019d like to release as a double album. Maybe add some canned laughter.\n\nAndy likes to involve his family in his work. And usually, his parents have found participating a pleasant experience. They helped him give out the milk and cookies after his Carnegie Hall appearance. They giggle when he shows old home movies in his act. But it wasn\u2019t like that one Thanksgiving, when he played a resort hotel in the Catskills.\n\n\u201cOne of his conditions was that the hotel accommodate the whole family, including my mother and Janice\u2019s mother, who had just turned eighty,\u201d says Stanley. \u201cIt was awful. He bombed. There was just nothing he did that made anyone laugh. And he had all of us, the whole family, come up onstage.\u201d\n\nNasty notes were posted on Andy\u2019s door. The family was hurt and humiliated. An irate patron accosted Andy as he sat with the Kaufmans in the grillroom. \u201cYou stunk!\u201d he screamed. Andy just sat there.\n\n\u201cI was ready to get up and poke the guy in the snoot,\u201d says Stanley, \u201cbut that\u2019s not Andy\u2019s way. Andy\u2019s very passive. When he was five or six, he had a friend, Jimmy, who used to beat up on him, and Andy wouldn\u2019t fight back. I got so mad once, I said, \u2018Goddamnit, Andy, why don\u2019t you hit him back?\u2019\u201d\n\nStanley slips a cassette into a video player, and a wrestling segment from The Merv Griffin Show comes on. \u201cOhhhh, Stanley, do we have to watch this?\u201d Janice says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can stand it.\u201d Nobody in the family likes Andy\u2019s wrestling, or Tony Clifton, for that matter. Almost in rebuke, the phone shrills.\n\n\u201cHi, pussycat,\u201d Janice says, smiling.\n\nIt\u2019s Andy. As the snarling bastard on the screen upends a hefty brunette, the dutiful son on the phone is asking after grandma\u2019s health, his father\u2019s business prospects, what\u2019s going on with the magazine guy.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stanley says. \u201cRelax. We haven\u2019t told him a thing about Tony Clifton. Yes, we\u2019re watching the wrestling. Sure, I\u2019ll be sure he sees the wrestling magazines.\n\n\u201cYes, we\u2019ll make sure he sees the stories about Buddy.\u201d\n\nBuddy \u201cNature Boy\u201d Rogers was the hero of Kaufman\u2019s youth. The \u201csaddest night\u201d of Andy\u2019s life was May 29th, 1963, when Nature Boy lost his world title to Bruno Sammartino at Madison Square Garden in an orgy of sneers and cracked bones. A \u201ctotally pure\u201d villain, Rogers was voted the most unpopular wrestler of 1962 in a fan poll, beating out Killer Kowalski and Crusher Lisowski. \u201cI once saw Buddy Rogers beat a guy unconscious so they had to carry him off on a stretcher,\u201d says Kaufman in awe. \u201cThen Buddy kicked the stretcher over. Buddy Rogers knows ways of manipulating a crowd like no one in the world.\u201d Since he retired in 1975, Rogers has been wheeling and dealing in real estate in Haddonfield, New Jersey. For the past two years, he has also been Kaufman\u2019s wrestling trainer, appearing in his corner on SNL in 1979.\n\n\u201cAndy thinks like I did about wrestling,\u201d says Rogers. \u201cI didn\u2019t care if you loved me or hated me. What the hell\u2019s the difference? As long as you intrigue your fans.\u201d\n\nRogers is confident that with Andy under his tutelage, no woman can beat him. But he gleefully concedes, \u201cThere are an awful lot of broads who would pay to see him get killed.\u201d\n\nI tell Buddy that some comics resent Andy for the wrestling and his other bizarre bits. \u201cHe reminds me of Gorgeous George,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cHe came in with a gimmick, and every other wrestler hated his guts. But he cashed in 11 million bucks in seven years. Andy has a chance to be the Gorgeous George of entertainment. Andy has balls.\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, do you think we might have some vegetables? I think some vegetables would be very nice.\u201d\n\nIt is eleven p.m. and I am sitting down to dinner at a Japanese restaurant with the real Andy Kaufman, vegetable lover. \u201cI\u2019m an open book,\u201d he says, bowing his head to say grace over the teriyaki. \u201cI have to be totally honest with you. That\u2019s the way I am.\u201d\n\nThe reason it is eleven o'clock and we have not yet eaten is transcendental meditation. Andy\u2019s mother had told me that TM is the most important thing in his life; Andy informs me it is a twice-daily ritual he hasn\u2019t missed for twelve years. He was meditating before dinner.\n\nHe tells me how he passed the afternoon. He dressed in his father\u2019s pink polyester jacket with the soiled white shirt cuffs dangling from the sleeves and went to Chock Full o\u2019 Nuts and pretended to be crazy, rattling his cup, talking loudly to himself, hollering about the \u201cfinest cuppa cawfee in New Yawk.\u201d And it was really neat. People turned away. A few even left.\n\nSome have called this \u201cconceptual comedy,\u201d engineered happenings designed to involve the passive. And, not coincidentally, to amuse the artist himself. It was writer and comedian Carl Reiner who persuaded his own manager, George Shapiro, to handle Kaufman. Reiner likens Andy\u2019s humor to \u201cChristo wrapping a mountain.\u201d He thinks some of the pieces are brilliant. But the wrestling, the Tony Clifton, the street gags\u2026\n\n\u201cUnless you let the audience in on the joke, you are making fools of them,\u201d says Reiner, \u201cand that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing with this Tony Clifton. The audience would love to be able to say, \u2018My God, what a wonderful character that man is playing, you can\u2019t even see him.\u2019 But they have to know it\u2019s really him, really Andy Kaufman. He has to tell them, somehow, \u2018I\u2019m going to do the worst act in the world, and the game we\u2019re playing is to see how long you can take it before you bomb me.\u2019 At least then there\u2019s an audience catharsis, even if it\u2019s anger instead of laughter. But they have to know why they\u2019re angry or laughing.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s playing a game and he\u2019s enjoying the game. But we\u2019re not enjoying it as much as he is. He goes into New York, mumbling and doing crazy things and yelling at people. Nobody\u2019s aware that it\u2019s not a bum, nobody\u2019s aware that it\u2019s Andy Kaufman. He is enjoying himself. He\u2019s entertaining himself. How brilliant a characterization can he do? It\u2019s so full and so clean nobody can see past the edges, where the character begins and he ends.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a comic,\u201d Kaufman says soberly, working the vegetables. \u201cI have never told a joke. I don\u2019t even watch comedians nowadays. It\u2019s hard for me to watch a stand-up. When I saw Richard Pryor at Philadelphia Hall in 1974, I couldn\u2019t understand it. It was all over my head. I didn\u2019t laugh once.\n\n\u201cThe comedian\u2019s promise is that he will go out there and make you laugh with him. I\u2019ve never done that in my life. My only promise is that I will try to entertain you as best I can.\n\n\u201cI can manipulate people\u2019s reactions. There are different kinds of laughter. Gut laughter used to happen from what I did. Gut laughter is where you don\u2019t have a choice, you\u2019ve got to laugh. Gut laughter doesn\u2019t come from the intellect. And it\u2019s much harder for me to evoke now, because I\u2019m known. They say, \u2018Oh, wow, Andy Kaufman, he\u2019s a really funny guy.\u2019 But I\u2019m not trying to be funny. I just want to play with their heads.\u201d\n\nThere was a time when it was a snap, a time when a strange-looking creature in a Hawaiian shirt could perform on Saturday Night Live and do things with a set of conga drums and rhythmic gibberish that put people on the floor. There was nothing intellectual about that laughter. And although your gut hurt like hell afterward, still, it was a harmless laughter. Nothing like the sulfurous chortles that Tony Clifton and woman-wrestling have begun to evoke.\n\nAndy says he\u2019s lost respect for conventional television\u2014even Saturday Night Live, because it takes no chances. It \u201cignores the theory of the accident,\u201d in his words. If he had his own live show, well\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see a gang of people come on with guns and take over the show, like they did with a subway train in the movie The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. I\u2019d have debates with people who get into fist fights. I\u2019d have a guy fall off the trapeze and get killed. Oh, first he\u2019d get sent to the hospital, and then he\u2019d die the next day. And people would say to one another, \u2018Wow, did you see the Andy Kaufman show last night? Did you see the guy get killed?\u2019\u201d This is what Andy likes to call \u201cgoing all the way.\u201d Of course, no one would really get hurt. \u201cBut people would always wonder,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s real? What\u2019s not? That\u2019s what I do in my act, test how other people deal with reality.\n\n\u201cOf course, with the wrestling, they know exactly what\u2019s going on,\u201d says Kaufman.\n\n\u201cThey know they\u2019re supposed to hate me. And I think they enjoy it.\u201d\n\nAfter his vegetables, after he has downed fifty vitamins one at a time, Andy feels like wrestling some women. He hauls our small party\u2014my wife and me and his date, Jill, a street-talking blond who claims she once provoked Mick Jagger into hurling hot tea at a photographer\u2014off to his old club, the Improv. He quietly asks the emcee, \u201cDon\u2019t introduce me as a comedian but as a professional wrestler, okay?\u201d\n\nThe capacity crowd is well into late rounds of Millers and vodka gimlets, warming to Andy\u2019s insults, hurling them back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve proven it!\u201d Andy is yelling. \u201cThe only thing women are capable of doing mentally is cooking the carrots, washing the potatoes \u2026\u201d\n\nThe beast has begun to snarl. Boo, get off.\n\n\u201c\u2026 Scrubbing the floor, raising the babies. Even the ones who scream [his voice is now a mincing whine], \u2018Women are equal, women are smart,\u2019 even they can\u2019t do it. In sixty-five matches no woman has beaten me. Why?\u201d\n\nThe room has become deathly quiet.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have the brains, bay-bee. Okay, so I\u2019m willing to offer fifty dollars to anyone who wants to come up and\u2026 .\u201d\n\nBoooooooo.\n\n\u201cShaddap. Why don\u2019t you come up here, bay-bee?\u201d\n\nWhen there are no takers, he waxes earnest. \u201cThis is not a fake, this is not a put-on. I\u2019ve dedicated myself to doing this for the last couple years, and I\u2019m serious about it, so\u2026 so if you\u2019d like, any woman can try to win fifty dollars by pinning me in three minutes\u2026 Is there anyone? Whaddsa madda, ya chicken? This is not a joke, bay-bee. Okay, you, big talker. Come on up. I\u2019ll take up to six women at once.\u201d\n\nBlow it out your ass, someone screams.\n\n\u201cBwaaaaaaaak, bwaaaaaaaak.\u201d He is clucking like a chicken, strutting up and down the stage, arms pinned back like wings. \u201cBwaaak-buck-bwaaak.\u201d\n\nFinally, a stocky blond breaks from her boyfriend and bounds onto the stage. \u201cI\u2019m from Pittsburgh, home of the Pirates and the Steelers, and I\u2019m gonna wrestle yer ass,\u201d she growls. Once a referee is drafted from the management, they hook up in a tangle of arms and hot-roller curls, tussling mightily on the hardwood stage.\n\nC'mon, Pittsburgh. Kick him, bite him, choke him.\n\nAs he throws her down hard, screaming insults, a plastic ashtray sails over the crowd and cracks apart on the brick wall beyond Andy\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cWho did that?!\u201d he bellows, and turns his attention back to his opponent. \u201cWhen I\u2019m finished,\u201d he pants, \u201cyou\u2019ll go back to Pittsburgh, back to the kitchen, and you\u2019ll be [whiny voice again] washing the dishes and peeling the carrots\u2026 .\u201d\n\nFrom our table, Jill, a former wrestling opponent with a fondness for sake, is yelling at the ashtray chucker. \u201cI\u2019m gonna kill the bitch who threw that!\u201d she screams, struggling with my wife for possession of our ashtray.\n\nOh, God. Andy\u2019s pink jacket lies like a dead flamingo in my arms as drinks crash to the floor. The crowd is on its feet, hot for blood, howling. Choke him. Kill the bastard. Thunderous booing indicates Andy has just pinned Pittsburgh. He fairly shoves her off the stage and saunters through the crowd, triumphant in his yellow flare-cut pants and undershirt, thumping his chest, banging into tables.\n\n\u201cAwright, once again I have proved there is no woman who can beat me. I got the brains\u2026 I got the brains\u2026 I\u2019m the winnah\u2026 .\u201d\n\nThey are booing louder, trying to shout him down, clawing at his shirttails, but he brushes them off like toast crumbs. Someone in the crowd starts a rival chant of Ali, Ali, Ali. Still his voice thunders: \u201cI am the best\u2026 I\u2019ve got the brains\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd from the bar: \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard the last from me, bay-bee.\u201d\n\n\u201cAndy Kaufman, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d soothes the emcee. \u201cAndy Kaufman. And next week, Andy will be appearing at Madison Square Garden to benefit the ERA.\u201d\n\n\u201cGee,\u201d says a woman at the next table. \u201cDo you think he really will?\u201d\n\nSo who is really crazy here? Kaufman, who is entertaining himself? Or his audience, which is paying to watch him entertain himself? Or does Kaufman just seem crazy because he\u2019s trying to extend his ten minutes of not being funny into a twenty-four-hour day?\n\nSometime in the middle of Tony Clifton\u2019s three-night run in San Francisco, I was awakened from an afternoon nap in my hotel room by the jangling of a telephone.\n\n\u201cHi, it\u2019s Andy,\u201d a voice said sweetly. \u201cMy manager told me you were in San Francisco, interviewing Tony Clifton. How\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are you calling from?\u201d\n\n\u201cLos Angeles.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you coming up here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cTony Clifton said onstage last night that he was going to sue your ass if you didn\u2019t show your face here to prove you aren\u2019t him,\u201d I explained.\n\n\u201cGee, I haven\u2019t heard anything about that. I\u2019d like to come up, but I have a date tonight with a cute girl I pinned at a mud-wrestling club last week.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re really missing something. Tony\u2019s been an absolute disaster. Last night he almost caused a riot. Someone threw a bottle.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? I can\u2019t believe it. Are you sure it wasn\u2019t his manager? Are you sure they weren\u2019t putting you on?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure you aren\u2019t in San Francisco?\u201d I said, but there was no way I could get him to give in, to break character. For Andy to acknowledge the transparent Tony Clifton would have been to admit that it is all a joke, that laughter is what he is seeking. Andy isn\u2019t in it for the laughs. Maybe that\u2019s why his friend Robin Williams calls him the kamikaze comic:\n\n\u201cKaufman\u2019s like a squirrel going over the Grand Canyon saying, \u2018Give up the nuts or die.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Was he a comedian? A performance artist? He became known for doing 10-minute sets that weren\u2019t comedy but made people laugh. How to top that?
