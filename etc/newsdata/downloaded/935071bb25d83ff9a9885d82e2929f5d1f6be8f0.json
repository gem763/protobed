The governing body introduced the rule change because it argues female athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD) \u2013 such as Semenya \u2013 have \u201ca competitive advantage\u201d.\n\nUnder the rule, all athletes with a difference in sex development should reduce their blood testosterone to a specific level for at least six months \u2013 and then maintain that for the rest of their athletic career \u2013 in order to compete in events from 400m to a mile. Semenya has remained \u201csteadfast in her defiance\u201d to do so and, as such, is unable to defend her 800m world title in Doha later this month without taking hormone-suppressing drugs. So the South African, has started training with Gauteng-based JVW FC with a view to making her debut next season as the transfer window is currently closed.\n\n\u201cI am grateful for this opportunity and I appreciate the love and support I already get from the team,\u201d she told the club\u2019s website. \u201cI am looking forward to this new journey, and hopefully I can contribute as much as I can to the club.\u201d\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nClub founder and South Africa captain Janine Van Wyk said: \u201cI am absolutely honoured that out of all the other women\u2019s clubs around the world, she has chosen JVW as the club where she would like to start showcasing her football skills.\n\n\u201cI welcomed her at her first training [session] with the team on Tuesday and was impressed to see that she definitely has all the fundamentals.\u201d\n\nSemenya is not the first athlete to transfer to football \u2013 100m and 200m Olympic champion Usain Bolt did the same after retiring in 2017, joining Stromsgodset in Norway prior to signing for Australia\u2019s Central Coast Mariners. However, it proved to be short stint in Gosford for the sprint icon; he left after only eight weeks at the club.\n\nSemenya will not be registered for the 2019 SAFA Sasol League, the league in which JVW play, as the transfer window has shut for the current season. She will train with the team and target being ready to play for them during the 2020 campaign.", "description": "The two-time Olympic 800m gold medallist Caster Semenya appears to be preparing for a career outside of athletics after joining a women\u2019s football club", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09af8206c7a12768850b03c4b1582c9f2aa1b739/0_75_2486_1492/master/2486.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=24a03eec77565ad87cb667e09c27d123", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
