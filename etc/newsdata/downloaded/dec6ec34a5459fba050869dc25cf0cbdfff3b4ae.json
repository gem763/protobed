Supplied\n\nBlack Sheep was founded in the same year in another garage, this time on the Gold Coast, and is known for hyper-collectable limited releases of out-there styles: it claims to be the first to cover cycling kit in florals, and later, camouflage. Babici, started in 2009 in Sydney, offers jerseys in batik patterns, Aboriginal artwork and one with a Bedouin-style scarf printed around the shoulders.\n\nBlack Sheep is known for its hyper-collectable limited releases of out-there styles. Supplied\n\nBabici founder Kev Babakian recently collaborated on a range with a Japanese tattoo artist. \u201cAll we do is create really beautiful apparel,\u201d he says. \u201cEuropeans love our stuff.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all a long way from a team kit emblazoned with the logo of France\u2019s national lottery. And yet the money is rolling in. Black Sheep is growing revenues by 30 per cent a year; at MAAP the growth is 60 per cent and Attaquer volunteers that it\u2019s doing \u201cdouble digits\u201d.\n\nAll three brands says their biggest growth market is offshore. And while no one is cashing out yet, all are approaching a point where decisions need to be made about managing that expansion. As Black Sheep founder John Polson puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad problem to have.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor sure, cycling kit has become a form of fashion,\u201d says Ollie Cousins. \u201cGone are the days when a cyclist with a sense of style will accept wearing daggy kit on the bike.\u201d\n\nThe pace is now set by a younger, more fashion-conscious generation who want their on-bike and off-bike image to align.\n\nCousins, 39, and his friend Jarrad Smith, 43, launched MAAP as a web-based and wholesale brand. They\u2019d met when Cousins was design director for streetwear brand Globe, and Smith was a Globe house model. \u201cThe design aesthetic is strong in both of us,\u201d says Cousins, who also worked on Mambo\u2019s creative team. \u201cI had always surfed, then Jarrad got me into cycling to keep fit, but it snowballed and took over my life. We raced in St Kilda club criteriums on Sundays and trained most days.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Cousins, the MAMIL tag [middle-aged man in Lycra] is derogatory, and outdated. Older riders used to throw on their ill-fitting team kit, but the pace is now set by a younger, more fashion-conscious generation who want their on-bike and off-bike image to align.\n\n\u201cThese 25- to 35-year old professional men and women, in particular, are proud to be called cyclists, and that\u2019s the key to what has driven growth in our segment of the sport,\u201d Cousins says. \u201cIt\u2019s about stylish, performance-focused apparel.\u201d\n\nMAAP now has almost 20 staff, including two contractors in Europe and casual employees in a North Melbourne retail shop, which opened in September 2018. There are plans for a pop-up store in Sydney in October. Having bootstrapped themselves for their first few years, the pair are now drawing upon a bank loan and acknowledge they\u2019ll need outside investors should they continue to grow. Of all the Australian cycling brands, they are most overt in pedalling the hardest.\n\nOf all the Australian cycling brands, MAAP are the most overt in pedalling the hardest. Supplied\n\n\u201cEven though cycling apparel is driven by trends, it\u2019s not fast fashion,\u201d says Cousins. \u201cIt\u2019s really performance-orientated fashion and that\u2019s quite unique to cycling. There\u2019s longevity for brands that really invest in R &D, and the potential to transition from start-ups into premium global lifestyle brands.\u201d\n\nIf that sounds familiar \u2013 an Australian brand built around sport with global ambitions \u2013 it\u2019s no mere coincidence. Cycling, says Cousins, has a synergy with surfing. \u201cIt\u2019s a sport that makes you get up and explore the outdoors. You\u2019ve escaped, you\u2019re enjoying the natural landscape.\u201d\n\nAnd should you land on the website of pretty much any cycling apparel brand, your screen will be filled with beautifully shot images designed to make you feel exactly that \u2013 the lone man, or woman, on their machine in the wilderness, tearing down from a mountain top, the long and winding road back up.\n\nWe set out to create a cycling lifestyle brand which was very much inspired by what the surf brands created in the '80s and '90s. \u2014 Jarrad Smith, MAAP co-founder\n\n\u201cWe set out to create a cycling lifestyle brand which was very much inspired by what the surf brands created in the '80s and '90s,\u201d says Smith. \u201cNow we are seeing the sport transforming into lifestyle. Cycling betrays all aspects of your life; where you travel, which brands you wear casually, what social circles you are in. The style of growth is very similar to what the surf industry went through 30 years ago.\n\nJarrad Smith, left, and Ollie Cousins from MAAP. Supplied\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The brands are all competing with each other and promoting the sport, developing collections, sponsoring teams and riders, hosting events. In the same way there were the big four brands in the surf industry, I think there\u2019s room for the same in cycling.\u201d\n\nPlaying Billabong to MAAP\u2019S Rip Curl is John Polson, founder of Black Sheep. \u201cThe similarity between surfing and cycling is on a deep level; it\u2019s the focus on community and the culture that comes off the back of that,\u201d says Polson. \u201cCyclists identify as cyclists. It\u2019s what we wake up for each morning.\u201d\n\nPolson, 32, is a physiotherapist and former professional triathlete who decided his passion was making and designing sportswear. \u201cI really got into the aerodynamics and thermoregulation in fabrics. It has scientific appeal, where I use my foundational knowledge from the physiology perspective, and then the textiles are not just about performance but about comfort and durability. And this is something I understand from years as a triathlete.\u201d\n\nJohn Polson: \"Cyclists identify as cyclists\". Supplied\n\nPolson says east Asia, including Taiwan are making the fastest advances in performance fabrics, which typically have been sourced from Italy and to a lesser extent Switzerland.\n\nSixty per cent of Black Sheep\u2019s sales are generated overseas, which Polson attributes to a business model that requires his roughly 30 international distributors to do more than just sell kit.\n\n\u201cOur distributors represent a community-building approach rather than another sales channel,\u201d he says. \u201cHow can we go into an area like Colombia and feel like Black Sheep is a part of that community? Maybe the distributor will organise local rides every week, or host the annual worldwide Man Ride, which we established to raise awareness about men\u2019s mental health.\n\n\"We are an authentic brand trying to do good. I don\u2019t see that changing as we grow. It\u2019s comfortable for us; the only downside is it\u2019s hard to measure the benefits.\u201d\n\nLast year Black Sheep launched its WMN range, designed by women, with 5 per cent of sales helping to finance promising young women to race overseas. Polson says he has no immediate plans for outside investment.\n\n\u201cIt would require the right person to come along who understands what we\u2019re trying to do as a brand.\u201d Black Sheep is now a team of 10, based at a new clubhouse in Brisbane\u2019s Teneriffe with a retail space, cafe and bike mechanic. As for the name, Polson says: \u201cPeople identify with the notion of being a black sheep. We all want to be unique.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMAAP, Attaquer, Black Sheep and Babici were far from the first to make stylish cycle kit. That honour goes to British brand Rapha, which launched in 2004. \u201cAustralia kicked it along from there five years ago,\u201d says Polson. \u201cIt took off in Europe after Australia\u2019s lead. The next two years will see a real maturing of the cycling apparel market globally.\u201d\n\nRapha\u2019s founder is an English luxury brand consultant and accountant named Simon Mottram, who, like the rest of the recreational cycling world, had to be content to wear the garish, sponsor-branded kits of professional cycling teams. It was a uniform in so far as there was no option but to dress the same as everybody else. Cyclists had no form of self-expression. Mottram hated that, so he set out to change how cycling looked.\n\nBlack Sheep's WMN range, donates 5 per cent of sales to financing promising young women cyclists. Supplied\n\n\u201cNo bank would touch me,\u201d he told the BBC in 2015. \u201cWho was really interested in cycling back in 2001 and 2002? It was just something us weirdos did.\u201d\n\nHe eventually secured funding from a mix of private investors and family and friends. In 2007 Rapha sales accelerated after London hosted the prologue of that year\u2019s Tour de France; England\u2019s cycling success at the 2012 London Olympics gave the business a further push.\n\nThe Rapha aesthetic is one of clean, stylish, block colours and highlights in bright colours, often pink; its simple logo in a Trade Gothic font captures the \u201cgolden era\u201d of cycling. Named for the 1960s Rapha Italian cycling team, which itself was named after the ap\u00e9ritif drink company Saint Rapha\u00ebl, Mottram created a seductive, aspirational brand.\n\nAnd didn\u2019t the amateur cycling world soak it up. In 2017, Rapha sold for \u00a3150 million to RZC Investments, a private equity firm run by two cycling-mad grandsons of Walmart founder Sam Walton. In 2018, Rapha Racing Ltd reported turnover had risen by 26.2 per cent.\n\nAttaquer cycling kit is based on art and streetwear, and surf and skate. Supplied\n\nWhen Greg Hamer and Stevan Musulin founded Attaquer in 2012, Rapha was the only style-conscious exception to the logo-festooned team kits. \u201cWe saw a niche for the fashion-conscious customer,\u201d says Musulin. \u201cIt was a niche borne of us not having options. You had gentlemanly kit from Rapha, or team kit. We wanted kit based on art and streetwear, and surf and skate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey have produced outfits featuring the artworks of Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat. One show-shopper featured slices of watermelons, another drew upon 80s Australiana. Strong international sales for the brand reflect a taste for the Attaquer look.\n\n\u201cAustralians have always been more fashion forward, willing to try new things and be more outstanding on the bike,\u201d says Hamer. \u201cAnd the Europeans are now embracing that. It\u2019s created a spark.\u201d\n\nMusulin, 42, had been national sales manager for high street brands G-Star and Ben Sherman while Hamer, 38, had worked in the bike industry as a product manager for importers; both rode mountain bikes and road bikes.\n\n\u201cWe set out almost like it was a bit of fun,\u201d says Musulin. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have high expectations. We just hoped it could be a full-time job and we could be our own bosses, and we achieved that a few years ago.\u201d The company\u2019s tagline is \u201cBe your alter ego\u201d.\n\nBlacksheep's limited-release model \u2013 a small range that is launched every three months \u2013 sells out in hours. Supplied\n\n\u201cThe range is expanding and we\u2019re hitting new markets, but we\u2019re still small enough to make changes quickly and have a go at new things,\u201d says Musulin. Whenever Hones, the lawyer fond of Attaquer, orders his 60 or so kits for the next season, either Musulin or Hamer will deliver it to his office and stay for some beers in the boardroom.\n\nThe brand has a lot of growth ahead of it, says Musulin, who swiftly adds that they\u2019re \u201cnot trying to take on the world\u201d.\n\nBabici's Salam shirt. Supplied\n\nSo how much does it cost to get the look? A jersey and bib (the bib-style knicks) from Attaquer costs up to $500. Designs are done in-house and manufactured in Italy and China. Fabrics are mostly Italian, some Swiss.\n\n\u201cTo an extent, our radical kit is our point of difference,\u201d says Musulin, \u201cbut we still have gentlemanly kit with block colours and minimal branding. Ultimately, premium quality is what will always bring people back to the brand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolson says Black Sheep\u2019s limited-release model \u2013 a small range in progressive styling that is launched every three months \u2013 sells out in hours. He\u2019s added an Essentials mix-and-match range and a winter Elements range. Black Sheep jersey and bib sets start at $350.\n\nMAAP launched its first women\u2019s range in 2016 and it\u2019s growing evenly with men\u2019s ranges. Cousins says three kits are required for people riding four to five times a week; a $2000 wardrobe outlay will see them through six months.\n\n\u201cThere are so many pieces you require and we love making fully interchangeable collections,\u201d he says. \u201cA core collection will not date and then we will release more graphic-focused jerseys that are seasonal and the bib shorts work across all of it.\u201d\n\nSo is there still a place for the logo-infested pro-team jersey? \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a no-no, which is in some ways a shame because the sales of those jerseys can help fund a team,\u201d says Cousins. \u201cBut aesthetically it\u2019s just not great.\u201d\n\nWhat all these kit manufacturers are doing, it\u2019s clear, is enjoying the ride.\n\n\u201cYou could be a 60-year-old businessman who every day of the week wears a suit,\u201d says Musulin. \u201cHe buys his $12,000 Colnago bike and he wants to wear a watermelon kit because he knows it gives him an opportunity to express his personality and be himself. He can\u2019t go to the office wearing that because the business dictates to him what he has to wear and how he has to look and behave to a large extent.\n\n\"When you get out on a bike you can do whatever the f--- you want, if you want to. We give people the opportunity to express themselves differently.\u201d\n\nThe September issue of AFR Magazine is out on Friday, August 30 inside The Australian Financial Review.
