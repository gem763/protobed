Even then, finding a place in the right location that\u2019s within budget can be hard.\n\nFor buyers struggling with this dilemma, up-and-coming suburbs can often offer similar amenities at a more affordable price point.\n\nNew realestate.com.au data reveals the comparably cheaper areas located near the most sought-after suburb in each capital city.\n\nWhere are the up-and-coming areas near your dream location? Use this interactive to get an indication based on demand and median price.\n\nPicking an up-and-coming area\n\nChanges in demographics in a relatively cheap neighbourhood is usually one of the first signs an area is up-and-coming, according to realestate.com.au chief economist Nerida Conisbee.\n\n\u201cThese are generally suburbs that attract a lot of first home buyers and they\u2019re not suburbs that are new suburbs.\n\n\u201cIf the area has a lot of old homes and there are a lot of old people living there, and then you start to see a lot of young people moving in, then you can generally see that it will probably become up-and-coming,\u201d she says.\n\nConisbee says the change in suburbs isn\u2019t linear and doesn\u2019t happen in the same way for each area.\n\nStay across local sales in your dream suburb using Track My Property.\n\nSo fringe suburbs at the edge of a city popular with buyers of house and land packages will not be up-and-coming neighbourhoods in the same way that inner-city suburbs can be, due to differences in things like infrastructure.\n\n\u201cGenerally the places that are most desirable have good public transport and for up-and-coming suburbs that gentrify you tend to find that they have pretty good public transport links,\u201d she says.\n\nWhat can you live without?\n\nFor buyers looking to pick the right up-and-coming area, an element of compromise is required.\n\n\u201cThe housing stock is often very different, so the houses may not be as nice or you\u2019re often further away from something people desire such as a beach, a really good shopping precinct, a train line or a good park or a school.\n\n\u201cYou may be closer to something people don\u2019t like such as a large freeway or a very busy road or there may be something that\u2019s a bit unattractive about the area.\n\n\u201cSo you have to look at \u2018what could I live with?\u2019 for a start. Are you prepared to live near a busy road or further from the beach, and can you improve the home \u2013 versus things you can\u2019t change like the fact that it\u2019s near a main road or away from a train station? These are the sorts of considerations I\u2019d be thinking about,\u201d she says.\n\nSydney: Can\u2019t afford Allambie Heights?
