The video has since been taken down.\n\nNg said he was not surprised at being kicked out of the competition, but said on Tuesday: 'I don't regret saying that stuff. And even now, I don't regret it at all.'\n\nThe Hong Konger said he had been distracted by the sometimes-violent unrest in his home city over the past four months.\n\n'Quite a number of large-scale protests overlapped the competition time,' he said. 'Sometimes, I couldn't focus on the competition.'\n\nThe makers of Hearthstone, Blizzard Entertainment, wrote in a statement Ng had broken their rules and said he will not receive any prize money -- US$10,000 according to Ng -- and will be banned from Hearthstone eSports for a year.\n\nThose rules say players must not engage in acts that bring themselves into 'public disrepute', offend anybody or damage the developer's image.\n\nThe video game industry last year generated more than $135 billion globally -- $43.4 billion of that in the United States alone.\n\nNg said his removal from the competition was 'a pity' after spending four years in eSports.\n\nNg said his removal from the competition was 'a pity' after spending four years in eSports.

'I'm just expressing myself and why should I be afraid of this kind of 'white terror'? This is my freedom of speech.\n\n'I shouldn't be scared. I hope my act can inspire other gamers like me, to continue to support the movement in Hong Kong.'\n\nThe gamer drew support from the gaming community, some of whom wrote on the Reddit-like forum LIHKG.\n\n'I really can't think of any reason why the developers in eSports would offend youngsters. Good luck to them,' wrote one user in Cantonese.\n\nAnother wrote: 'I had been supporting the Blizzard Entertainment for nearly 20 years. I bought most of its games. I'm uninstalling all its games. I will not support Blizzard anymore.'", "description": "Top online gamer from Hong Kong Ng Wai Chung was expelled from the eSports tournament Sunday after he showed support for the city's pro-democracy movement during a live-stream.", "authors": ["Sophie Tanno For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/10/19483254-0-image-a-2_1570613002555.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
