Mexico, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were the only countries identified.\n\nWhatsApp said in a statement that 100 civil society members had been targeted, and called it \u201can unmistakable pattern of abuse.\u201d\n\nNSO denied the allegations.\n\n\"In the strongest possible terms, we dispute today\u2019s allegations and will vigorously fight them,\" NSO said in a statement. \"The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime.\"\n\nWhatsApp said the attack exploited its video calling system in order to send malware to the mobile devices of a number of users. The malware would allow NSO's clients - said to be governments and intelligence organizations - to secretly spy on a phone's owner, opening their digital lives up to official scrutiny.\n\nWhatsApp is used by some 1.5 billion people monthly and has often touted a high level of security, including end-to-end encrypted messages that cannot be deciphered by WhatsApp or other third parties.\n\nCitizen Lab, a cybersecurity research laboratory based at the University of Toronto that worked with WhatsApp to investigate the phone hacking, told Reuters that the targets included well-known television personalities, prominent women who had been subjected to online hate campaigns and people who had faced \u201cassassination attempts and threats of violence.\u201d\n\nNeither Citizen Lab nor WhatsApp identified the targets by name.\n\nGovernments have increasingly turned to sophisticated hacking software as officials seek to push their surveillance power into the furthest corners of their citizens' digital lives.\n\nCompanies like NSO say their technology enables officials to circumvent the encryption that increasingly protects the data held on phones and other devices. But governments only rarely talk about their capabilities publicly, meaning that the digital intrusions like the ones that affected WhatsApp typically happen in the shadows.\n\n\n\n\n\nUNPRECEDENTED MOVE\n\nLawyer Scott Watnik called WhatsApp's move \"entirely unprecedented,\" explaining that major service providers tended to shy away from litigation for fear of \"opening up the hood\" and revealing too much about their digital security. He said other firms would be watching the progress of the suit with interest.\n\n\"It could certainly set a precedent,\" said Watnik, who chairs the cybersecurity practice at the Wilk Auslander law firm in New York.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to have NSO barred from accessing or attempting to access WhatsApp and Facebook's services and seeks unspecified damages.\n\nNSO\u2019s phone hacking software has already been implicated in a series of human rights abuses across Latin America and the Middle East, including a sprawling espionage scandal in Panama and an attempt to spy on an employee of the London-based rights group Amnesty International.\n\nNSO came under particularly harsh scrutiny over the allegation that its spyware played a role in the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul a little over a year ago.\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s friend Omar Abdulaziz is one of seven activists and journalists who have taken the spyware firm to court in Israel and Cyprus over allegations that their phones were compromised using NSO technology. Amnesty has also filed a lawsuit, demanding that the Israeli Ministry of Defense revoke NSO\u2019s export license to \"stop it profiting from state-sponsored repression.\"\n\nNSO has recently tried to clean up its image after it was bought by London-based private equity firm Novalpina Capital earlier this year. In August, NSO co-founder Shalev Hulio appeared on \"60 Minutes\" and boasted his spyware had saved \"tens of thousands of people.\" He provided no details.\n\nNSO has also brought on a series of high-profile advisers, including former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge and Juliette Kayyem, a senior lecturer in international security at Harvard University. Last month, NSO announced it would begin abiding by U.N. guidelines on human rights abuses.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Raphael Satter in Washington and Elizabeth Culliford in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Leslie Adler and Richard Pullin)", "description": "WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - WhatsApp sued Israeli surveillance firm NSO Group on Tuesday, accusing it of helping government spies break into the phones of roughly 1,400 users across four continents in a hacking spree whose targets included diplomats, political dissidents, journalists and senior", "authors": ["Raphael Satter", "Elizabeth Culliford"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zR0s5LsAW41nx7yXLIkIQg--~B/aD01MzM7dz03OTk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/4f34047ac7918359e780b4727296abd9", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
