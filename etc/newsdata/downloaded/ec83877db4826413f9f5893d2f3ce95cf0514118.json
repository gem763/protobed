These apps ranges from a special launcher to serve up relevant apps based on the time of the day and location, to a group game that challenges you and your friends not to unlock your phone.\n\nHowever, the most simple, and perhaps the most effective app is a live wallpaper app. Unlock Clock, as the name suggests, is a live wallpaper that\u2019ll show you the number of times you\u2019ve unlocked your phone on a particular day.\n\nYour unlock count for the day as a live wallpaper on Android\n\nThe idea is solid: to make you feel guilty about the times when you unlocked the phone to do nothing, or just check Instagram when you were bored.\n\nThere isn\u2019t really a set target to aim for, as we all use our phones differently. But it certainly helps to start quantifying your dependence on your phone as a cure for boredom, and to get a sense of what it\u2019s like when you consciously try to cut down on that. Hopefully, it\u2019ll help train you to stop picking up your phone every so often, and you won\u2019t even need the app after a while.\n\nYou can download Unlock Clock from here, and read more about Google\u2019s new digital wellbeing experiment here.\n\nRead next: When you Google your company\u2019s name \u2014 do you like what you see?", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FUnlock-count.jpg&signature=76cd4220c2ade6a969f1c9efbad15c84", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
