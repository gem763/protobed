Kamala Harris said Saturday that she had not \u201creally heard or processed\u201d what was said before she laughed in response to someone describing President Trump\u2019s policies as \u201cmentally retarded.\u201d\n\nMs. Harris, California Democrat, offered the explanation amid facing criticism after video of the recent exchange began circulating on social media over the weekend.\n\n\u201cLet me just be really clear,\u201d Ms. Harris told NBC News. \u201cI would never condone that kind of language being spoken by anybody about anybody,\u201d she said in a video shared by the network.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s offensive, and you would think that in the year 2019, people would have a much better understanding how hurtful a term like that can be \u2013 but also the history behind it, which is the history of really ignoring the needs and the realities and the capacity of our disabilities community,\u201d Ms. Harris told CBS News, the outlet reported.\n\nVideo of the exchange shared Friday on Twitter showed Ms. Harris being asked at a campaign event about how she planned to reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cmentally retarded\u201d actions if elected.\n\n\u201cWell said,\u201d Ms. Harris laughed in response. \u201cWell said.\u201d\n\nAsked about the exchange afterward, CBS reported that Ms. Harris indicated she did not fully understood what was asked.\n\n\u201cI heard him talk about the other stuff. And then that came later. And it was not something that I really heard or processed,\u201d Ms. Harris reportedly told the network.\n\nMs. Harris had come under fire after the video surfaced online, drawing the ire of disability advocates over her apparent approval of the use of the word \u201cretarded.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsing \u2018retarded\u2019 as a slur and an insult is never, EVER \u2018well said\u2019,\u201d said Kendall Brown, a self-described disabled healthcare advocate who shared video of the exchange from her verified Twitter account. \u201cIt\u2019s ALWAYS a betrayal of the disability community.\u201d\n\n\u201cR-word is unacceptable. It is a slur, an insult,\u201d agreed actor and activist Nyle DiMarco. \u201cKamala should have handled this better.\u201d\n\nMs. Harris, a former attorney general for California, is among 10 candidates who have qualified to participate in the third and next Democratic primary debate scheduled for Thursday, Sept. 12.\n\nThe results of recent polling released last week by Quinnipiac University said that 7% of Democratic voters surveyed prefer the senator to the rest of the pack, placing her in fourth-place behind former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat and Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vermont Independent.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
