Johnson\u2019s confidential response was sent to the watchdog on Tuesday night an hour after the initial deadline.\n\nThe letter was marked \u201cconfidential and not for publication\u201d but a spokeswoman for the committee said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t answer any of our questions.\u201d\n\nThe committee chair, Labour\u2019s Len Duvall, has asked for legal advice about whether the watchdog can discuss the letter at an open meeting next Wednesday.\n\nThe meeting is also expected to decide whether the committee should use its powers to summon the former mayor to answer questions in person as it did over his failed garden bridge project.\n\nAnd it could even decide to force Johnson to hand over private text messages and emails he sent to Arcuri. Duvall said the committee planned to take the matter further.\n\n\u201cNothing in [Johnson\u2019s] response, in our opinion, reflects the need for confidentiality,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, the response is insufficient as far as our request for information is concerned.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on our investigation and considering next steps. A number of options are open to us. They include speaking to various people and using our power of summons.\u201d\n\nThe committee was alarmed by revelations in the Sunday Times that Arcuri was awarded thousands of pounds in public money, including \u00a311,500 by the mayor\u2019s promotional agency London & Partners.\n\nJohnson\u2019s office also intervened to give her a place on trade missions to New York and Tel Aviv with the then mayor, after she was initially turned down because she failed to meet the criteria.\n\nThis week, Arcuri confirmed she shared a \u201cvery close bond\u201d with Johnson and he visited her east London flat up to 10 times, but she insisted she was not given favourable treatment by the then mayor or his officials.\n\nLast month, Duvall wrote to Johnson asking for details and a timeline of all contact with Arcuri throughout his mayoralty.\n\nHe also asked for an explanation of how his \u201calleged relationship was disclosed and taken into account in any and all dealings with the GLA [Greater London Authority] and other parts of the GLA family\u201d.\n\nIt is understood Johnson\u2019s confidential response failed to provide those details. The prime minister has insisted \u201cfull propriety\u201d was followed and he has no interest to declare over Arcuri.\n\nMeanwhile, the Independent Office for Police Conduct is expected to make a decision before the end of the month on whether to launch an investigation into allegations of misconduct in public office.\n\nAn official at the Greater London authority formally referred the allegations to the police watchdog, because Johnson headed the mayor\u2019s office for policing and crime as part of his role.\n\nSeparately, the current London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has launched an independent review of how Arcuri was given sponsorship and access to trade trips.\n\nAnd the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport is withholding more than half of a \u00a3100,000 grant awarded this year to Arcuri\u2019s company Hacker House, pending a review into how the money was allocated.", "description": "Oversight committee says PM failed to provide details of contact with businesswoman", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver", "Simon Murphy", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbb0723e7bd50d0c859641080050d7af7f7c7800/0_203_3960_2376/master/3960.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fe753cb6a64a5db16dff43de3da299d2", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
