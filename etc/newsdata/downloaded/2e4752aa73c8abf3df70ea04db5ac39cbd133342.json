Here\u2019s what I liked best.", "language": "en", "text": "After downloading the necessary iOS software (an hour for me), I downloaded each game (about five minutes each). I budgeted 10 minutes to spend on each game and rank them in the order of which titles I most wanted to return to after the time expired. The truth is though, I often went over my 10 minutes for some titles because, well, they were enjoyable. For those in the top ten, I returned to play an hour or more.\n\nHere are my impressions after 300 (plus) minutes in the Apple Arcade.\n\nAD\n\n1. Sayonara Wild Hearts (Annapurna/Simogo)\n\nAD\n\nWhen you find something extraordinary, you just want to tell everyone. \u201cSayonara Wild Hearts\u201d hooked me immediately. The pure Japanese pop, the vivid, carefully-created art style, the fast-paced, panicked speeding on a motorcycle, the touching story \u2014 all these combine for a game you never want to put down. That\u2019s because it takes place in lands you wish were real.\n\n2. Grindstone (CapyGames)\n\nThere\u2019s a heavy touch of \u201cCandy Crush\u201d here, but Grindstone lacks the despicable micropayments. As a Conan-like brute, you chain monsters together for kills. While directions come and go too quickly on the field of play, I feel Grindstone could really hook me.\n\nAD\n\n3. Rayman Mini (Ubisoft Montpellier/Pastagames)\n\nThis Ubisoft jewel seems to scream the word \u201cdelightful!\u201d \u201cRayman Mini\u201d begins in a lush setting with streams and waterfalls. The adorable, eponymous character is about the size of a puffy dandelion seed head. The variety of peppy music with on-helium vocals makes almost every part of Rayman a joy to play. One thing that\u2019s hard to do: turn the character and go back. Other than that, bravo.\n\nAD\n\n4. Neo Cab (Fellow Traveller/Chance Agency)\n\nIt\u2019s dialog-heavy science fiction of the person-versus-technology variety. You play Lina, a driver who picks up her fares and begins to unravel the evils of a mega corporation. There\u2019s an earnest depth in the relationships here from the get go, partially due to the facial expressions that remind me of the interviewing portions in Rockstar Games\u2019 L.A. Noire, except on a less detailed level.\n\nAD\n\n5. The Pinball Wizard (Frosty Pop)\n\nIn \u201cThe Pinball Wizard,\u201d you whack around a childlike wizard/ball. He spews babyish non-words as he hits targets and banks around a playfield to progress to more challenging tables. The flipper controls can sometimes get stuck in the up position in this dungeon crawler/pinball mash-up. Nastily, it doesn\u2019t save your games early on. Power up-filled, it\u2019s a newish riff on the old game, and I\u2019ll play a lot more (already have).\n\nAD\n\n6. Assemble With Care (ustwo Games)\n\nBolstered by a sincere-sounding voice actor, \u201cAssemble With Care\u201d is a small, prose-heavy game featuring a young woman traveling in Italy. She fixes phones and cameras, and observes the vagaries of human nature. While the humans she encounters are not unique enough, the story of her empowerment is one I want to hear more of. Is there a twist or something deeper here?\n\nAD\n\n7. ChuChu Rocket! Universe (Sega Hardlight)\n\nAn update for a beloved Sega Dreamcast game, this showcases mice blasted into space via rockets. You get them back to their rockets via devious grids the rodents must navigate. \"ChuChu Rocket\" can be brainbusting and synapse splitting. But it's a must play as well.\n\n8. Jenny LeClue - Detectivu (Mografi)\n\nIt\u2019s a murder story within a writer\u2019s process story within a visual novel. You first meet Jenny LeClue in the Twins Peaks-like town of Arthurton. The glasses-wearing redhead is flossing her teeth and missing one, and that immediately endeared me. The pace here is quick enough and the dialogue often winning. This game is made for young adults, but I\u2019ll be back to solve any crime that includes Jenny, \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest detective.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n9. Cricket Through The Ages (Devolver Digital)\n\nThis wacky look at cricket history includes characters who are hard to control, almost as if they have no muscles. You start in the age of cave man and move through world war, all with cricket themes. \u201cCricket Through the Ages\u201d is a Monty Python-esque send up that includes the Queen as a guest star. I came back and played for over an hour. I thought it would get old, but it hasn\u2019t yet.\n\n10. Spek (RAC7 Games)\n\nA simple, relaxing game of geometry, Spek is about moving a black dot over a movable line to find a square, sometimes in an Escher-like space. I can see playing this slow offering on a plane or before bed. When I return, I hope the ambient music will be more varied.\n\nAD\n\n11. Sonic Racing (Sega/Hardlight)\n\nIt's a boisterous cacophony! Moments in, someone yells \"Sonic Racing!!!\" Percussion slams through the speakers. Playing online as Sonic or one of his pals against opponents (who thankfully can't talk to me) makes my iPhone 10 heat up and occasionally freeze. But I continued to race. Hot hands or not, I'm ready for crazed speed.\n\nAD\n\n12. Atone: Heart of the Elder Tree (Wildboy Studios)\n\nIt's the art style that hooked me. In this tale of Norse mythologies which sees the people and animals die around you while you're asleep, you gaze in absolute wonder at the woodcut-inspired art that's both magical and abstract. As you piece together clues to what happened, you'll find yourself at dead ends. Navigating these haunted forests is not easy!\n\nAD\n\n13. The Get Out Kids (Frosty Pop)\n\nSomewhat creepy, this narrative-rich game is about kids dealing with a house that has seen mysterious deaths over the years. The kids have setbacks, too, as one packs an epi before leaving her room. And then, animals begin to disappear. I admire the design of an interactive adventure novel broken up into chapters, and I'll be back for more.\n\n14. Cat Quest II (Gentlebros Games)\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s a game of medieval might and power, and winter is coming \u2014 with cats. I could live without cat puns like \u201cpurrsecution.\u201d But since it features some of the tightest controls of all the Arcade games, I\u2019ll be back to this semi-Purrfect game.\n\nAD\n\n15. Projection: First Light (Blowfish Studios Games)\n\nThe use of shadow puppets for the characters in \"Projection\" is savvy, but the story of a girl who runs away from home after stealing and being chided by her parents is thin. Here, you control light and create shadows as platforms to move forward to move around. It was fine until I got stuck in a crevasse and the shadow mechanic didn\u2019t work.\n\n16. Frogger in Toy Town (Konami)\n\n\u201cFrogger in Toy Town,\u201d the latest in a series of classics from 50-year-old Konami, has more unique challenges, powerups and obstacles than I remember in the old games. But the controls aren\u2019t as tight as they could be. As you rescue baby frogs in a suburban home, you feel a bit like you\u2019re in a \u201cToy Story\u201d film. And (shivers) some toys are out to get you.\n\nAD\n\n17. Cardapocalypse (Gambrinous)\n\nThis won me over immediately due to its 90s metal theme song. Combine that with the rebellious, Peppermint Patty-like Jess character and this card game rocks even before you complete its tutorial. To be honest, I don\u2019t even like card games. But I like this one. In story mode, the acting\u2019s not perfect, but the dashes of humor make up for it.\n\n18. Hot Lava (Klei Entertainment)\n\nHow brilliantly this begins! You're treated to an old school Saturday morning cartoon about your protagonist heroes, the Global Action Team, complete with video commercials for action toys. The game features a floor made of fear-inspiring lava. You have to run and hop on staircases and chairs to avoid the burning. I feel good here, like I'm in a new style of game. But I'll use a controller when I return for more accurate movement.\n\nAD\n\n19. Shinsekai Into The Depths (Capcom)\n\nShinsekai, which means \u201cnew world\u201d in Japanese, takes you deep into the green ocean depths. In this platformer, I worry about oxygen running out and ice crushing my bones. In the varied underwater environment, there\u2019s an ambient loneliness to your workmanlike character who seems tired but ardent. There were control issues as I moved by character up seabottom burms, but I\u2019d come back for more. I like to be alone.\n\n20. Dead End Job (Ant Workshop)\n\nIn a nod to \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d you shoot, then vacuum ghosts room by room until they can\u2019t take it anymore. There are also nods to \u201cThe Ren and Stimpy Show\u201d in the art style. There are a lot of inspirations here. Even if you realize that, Dead End Job is still a hoot to play.\n\n21. Oceanhorn 2 Knights of the Lost Realm (Cornfox & Brothers)\n\nDuring the introduction, phrases like \u201cThe sands of time have run many times\u201d and \u201cIt was a dark and stormy night\u201d struck me as awfully cliche writing and not intended to be ironic. But the graphics here are richly detailed in a likable \u201cBreath of the Wild\u201d way. Here\u2019s another game that makes the mistake of not offering a complete tutorial early on. I\u2019ll be back to learn more to see if the challenges aren\u2019t as tired as the early narrative writing.\n\n22. Where Cards Fall (Snowman/The Game Band)\n\nThis platformer with ambient music has one cool new thing: a deck of faceless cards you spread out to move forward over water features and canyons. I got no hint of story in the first 10 minutes. But spreading the deck of cards is satisfying, so I'll return.\n\n23. Lego Brawls (The Lego Group/RED Games)\n\nThe problem with this riff on \"Super Smash Bros.\" lies in the controls and in the lack of parity online. You're thrown in with top notch players from moment one. That doesn't inspire me to want to level up to compete. It makes me feel like a failure. Still, the variety of humorous power-ups like pie guns is more than okay.\n\n24. The Enchanted World (AI Interactive/Noodlecake Studios)\n\nAs you begin, you're introduced to a wandering witchlike fairy, engaging ambient music and sliding block puzzles that allow her to continue her forest path toward a variety of worlds. Her best friend has turned into a red bird, and there's some brown nefarious monstrous thing underground. It's kind of cute and sweet, but the sliding block puzzles are the appeal here.\n\n25. EarthNight (Cleaversoft)\n\nWant to be the mother of dragons? \u201cEarthNight\u201d is a unique runner on the backs of the highflying beasts. Yet it\u2019s not as compelling as I originally thought at E3. That\u2019s because you don\u2019t immediately see much personality in the old man and young girl characters. I\u2019ll return to run on these scaly backs, but with lower expectations.\n\n26. Bleak Sword (Devolver Digital/More8Bit)\n\nWhat \u201cBleak Sword\u201d does with bit art and a black, white and red palette is enviable. But the game can be unforgiving from early on. The laughing skull you see each time you die can feel hauntingly mocking. I lost the sense of joy but will come back around Halloween for some scares.\n\n27. Sneaky Sasquatch (RAC7 Games)\n\nThe idea of a famished sasquatch who uses stealth to survive and make mayhem at a camping site is a good one. So is the simple, cartoony art and early \"Legend of Zelda\"-inspired design. Yet even with the addition of a sly fox who sends me on short missions, I'm not that compelled to return.\n\n28. Murder Mystery Machine (Blazing Griffin)\n\nIf you like TV procedurals like \u201cSVU,\u201d you might like this. But as someone who needs tight, witty dialogue to move forward, this falls flat from the get-go. If you\u2019ve seen any TV procedural, you know what\u2019s going on here. I don\u2019t have the patience to collect clues and solve mysteries if there are no new twists to the story.\n\n29. What the Golf (Triband)\n\nThis idea of using anything nearby - including houses - as a something to hit to the green and into the hole is, at first, hilarious. But the visual puns wore on me and the joke dissipated quickly. I might come back when I'm in a mood for something mildly absurd.\n\n30. Overland (Finji)\n\nThis game looks like another post-apocalyptic misery in which you flee town due to the infected zombies. It\u2019s a road trip to hell, and I like that idea. But I don\u2019t know what to do in this turn-based strategy game. Where\u2019s the tutorial? The controls seem clunky. I can\u2019t even leave the first screen. I feel like Clark Griswold stuck in a London roundabout.\n\nHarold Goldberg is a freelance writer who has written for the New York Times, Playboy, Vanity Fair and elsewhere.
