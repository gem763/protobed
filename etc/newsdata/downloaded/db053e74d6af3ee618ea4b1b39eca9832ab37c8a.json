Black Friday, that annual orgy of high street sales and bickering shoppers, is weeks away (November 29). But it\u2019s not all flat-screen TVs and breadmakers, the travel industry is in on the act, too.\n\nWhat can I expect in terms of travel deals?\n\nPlenty. Last year we saw return flights to Los Angeles for just \u00a3175 - with Air New Zealand, no less, half-price Maldives holidays and an all-inclusive week in Florida, peak season, for just \u00a3319 per person. There was also a whole raft of impressive hotel and spa offers, cruise deals and ski discounts.\n\nThis year the travel industry is in a state of flux after the failure of Thomas Cook. The collapse of the one of UK\u2019s oldest tour operators has left some of the most popular European and winter sun hotspots with empty beds to fill.\n\nHays Travel, which purchased almost all of Thomas Cook\u2019s stores, may come out swinging with some remarkable offers. If other travel companies are still feeling the pinch, it is highly likely they will bring a new round of deals to the table in November.\n\nAnywhere in particular?\n\nThose destinations hit hardest by Thomas Cook\u2019s demise could be a good place to start. Spain has lost as many as 1.3 million holidaymakers for its autumn and winter season, with 500 hotels said to be at risk of closure.\n\nThe Canary Islands could be a good bet Credit: Getty\n\nThe country\u2019s key destinations could therefore attempt to encourage visitors back with cut-price holidays. Keep your eye on the Balearics and the Canaries.\n\nTunisia and Turkey, two nations on the recovery trail after periods of instability, might also be ripe for deals.\n\nThere will likely be offers on trips to Sri Lanka, with the island nation looking to return to prosperity after the Foreign Office imposed a temporary travel restriction in the wake of the Easter bombings earlier this year.\n\nWhat about cheap flights?\n\nBritish Airways celebrated its 100th birthday this year, but also had to contend with a number of devastating strikes. It could yet see out the year of its centenary with some bumper offers.\n\nBudget giants EasyJet and Ryanair have also had to handle some industrial action, as well as the uncertainty of Brexit. I\u2019d expect some flash sales but nothing dramatic.\n\nNorwegian has emerged as the last man standing in the low-cost, long-haul market, and has sought to consolidate its successful routes, and trim the fat on others. This could mean a raft of deals to US destinations, such as Tampa, New York and San Francisco. It might also look to attract more business to its Buenos Aires route.\n\nOn the flip-side, keep an eye on rail operators such as Eurostar, who may look to capitalise on the growing environmental clamour around aviation emissions and tempt travellers with train deals.\n\nAnd cruise deals, too?\n\nCruise operators could continue their drive to attract a younger audience, or they could look to capitalise on the growing popularity of river cruises.\n\nFigures released last year showed that more Britons than ever had taken to the continent\u2019s waterways, with the Rhine and Danube fuelling growth. The Douro in Portugal and Russia\u2019s rivers were also growing in popularity.\n\nCruise on the Douro, anyone?\n\nHow do I spot the best deals?\n\nNo one is better at working up excitement over deals and discounts than the travel industry, and over the next few weeks we will be assailed by the most intensive barrage of offers and booking incentives of the year. It begins with the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, and continues in January with the traditional promotion of next summer\u2019s holidays.\n\nMany may indeed offer excellent value. After all, the great thing about travel from the consumer\u2019s point of view is that it is date-stamped: you can\u2019t sell yesterday\u2019s empty airline seat or hotel room, so the closer you get to a departure date, the more power the buyer usually has.\n\nNow is a good time to book last-minute holidays. Low demand means that until mid-December you will rarely find a cheaper time for a city break or some winter sun. A fabulous start to the ski season \u2013 as there was last season \u2013 could mean that, if you can get away before Christmas, you can take advantage of the cheapest and quietest weeks of the year.\n\nMore probably, though, you are looking to next summer, and for this the industry has another agenda. It is not selling distressed stock, it wants as many bookings as it can get well in advance so it has money in the bank and can plan for the future.\n\nHence the incentives on offer every January. If you want to travel during the school holidays these deals can be worth snapping up since the earliest bookers get first pickings, which can make a big difference to a holiday, with flights or ferries that depart at civilised times, and the best located villas or hotels.\n\nSo, if you are booking last minute or planning ahead, how do you judge what constitutes a real deal? Here are a few suggestions:\n\nDiscounts\n\nDon\u2019t be distracted by the number in front of the percentage sign: it\u2019s the number behind the pound sign that counts.\n\n'Free\u2019 extras\n\nBe wary. You are probably overpaying for one element and subsidising another. This is often the case with so-called \u201cfree\u201d child places, where the adults have to pay an extra supplement because the children are not being charged. Some extras may well be worth having \u2013 upgrades on a flight or room type, for example.\n\nValue versus price\n\nThey may not be directly related. It might be of particular value to you, for example, to know you have secured the holiday you want and don\u2019t have to worry any more.\n\nPrice-match promises\n\nThey sound reassuring, but are rarely invoked, and are often so hedged with caveats as to be pretty pointless.\n\nLow deposits\n\nIf cash is short after Christmas, these offers may help but should not be seen as something you can cancel later without taking too much of a loss. The small print nearly always requires you to pay the full deposit a few weeks later and this is payable even if you cancel.\n\nInspiration for your inbox\n\nSign up to Telegraph Travel's new weekly newsletter for the latest features, advice, competitions, exclusive deals and comment.\n\nYou can also follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.", "description": "", "authors": ["Hugh", "Morris", "Nick Trend", "Travel News Editor", "Benedict Allen", "Annabel Fenwick Elliott"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/sri-lanka-GettyImages-1129567869-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
