(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nHours after appearing to confirm that he had discussed former vice president Joe Biden and his son with Ukraine\u2019s president in an exchange at the center of a whistleblower complaint, President Trump took to Twitter on Sunday night to insist again that he had done nothing wrong on a \u201cnice\u201d call with the foreign leader and to slam his Democratic rival.\n\nThe tweets came after a full day of attacks against the Democratic presidential nominee by Trump administration officials and allies who demanded investigations of Biden and his son Hunter despite a lack of evidence of wrongdoing, as The Washington Post\u2019s Seung Min Kim and Felicia Sonmez reported.\n\n[Trump suggests he mentioned Biden in phone call with Ukrainian president]\n\nTrump repeated those claims on Sunday night, again without any evidence, writing, \u201cSleepy Joe Biden, on the other hand, forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son\u2019s company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the real story!\u201d Trump added.\n\nThe Post\u2019s Fact Checker has previously found no merit to allegations that Joe Biden used the threat of withholding loans to force out a prosecutor who had investigated a natural gas company that hired Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest claims come as Democratic calls for impeachment intensify over an extraordinary whistleblower complaint that was first reported by The Post last week. The complaint reportedly alleged that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe Biden and his son during a July 25 phone conversation.\n\nAlthough the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general found the complaint credible and urgent enough to disclose to congressional committees, Trump has repeatedly insisted he did nothing wrong and his administration has refused to share details of the complaint with Congress.\n\n[\u2018We\u2019ve been very weak\u2019: House Democrats decry their oversight of Trump, push Pelosi on impeachment]\n\nThe president sounded a similar note on Sunday night, while apparently referencing a Wall Street Journal report that he had asked Zelensky eight times to investigate the former vice president.\n\n\u201cNow the Fake News Media says I \u2018pressured the Ukrainian President at least 8 times during my telephone call with him,\u2019\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThis supposedly comes from a so-called \u2018whistleblower\u2019 who they say doesn\u2019t even have a first hand account of what was said. More Democrat/Crooked Media con \u2026\u201d\n\nTrump then apparently referenced a Saturday story in which Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko told a local television station that \u201cI think there was no pressure\u201d from Trump on the call with Zelensky, as Reuters reported. (Zelensky has yet to comment on the case.)\n\n\u201cBreaking News: The Ukrainian Government just said they weren\u2019t pressured at all during the \u2018nice\u2019 call,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n[Fact-checking Trump\u2019s latest claims on Biden and Ukraine]\n\nEarlier Sunday, though, the president appeared to confirm with reporters outside the White House that he had brought up Biden and his son with Zelensky on the call.\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d Trump said on Sunday morning. \u201cAnd Ukraine, Ukraine\u2019s got a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nDemocrats say asking Ukraine to find damaging information on a potential 2020 rival could amount to another attempt to involve a foreign power in American elections. Intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump, a claim the president denies.\n\nThe story is likely to dominate Trump\u2019s week at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where he arrived on Sunday \u2014 and where he\u2019s scheduled to meet Zelensky on Wednesday.", "description": "President Trump again pointed the finger at the former vice president's dealings in Ukraine, without adding any evidence of wrongdoing.", "authors": ["Tim Elfrink", "Editor Of The Morning Mix", "September At Am", "Tim Elfrink Joined The Washington Post In He'S The Editor Of Morning Mix."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lNeEQPyuku34LiHQWLfs6IQOy5Q=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5AGQJJYTSVFFHCZ5776OFG5QSI", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
