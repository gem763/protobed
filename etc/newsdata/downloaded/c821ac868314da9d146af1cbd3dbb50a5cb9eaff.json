While others, well, need a bit more of a rush. Want to dangle off cliffs as a form of entertainment? Many do. (I eat for fun so trust me I am not judging.)\n\nSelfies and travelling go hand-in-hand; so if you did not post it, did it even happen? Many people have died in the process of trying to get the perfect snap for the Gram, but that has not deterred other daredevils from taking that hair-raising shot.\n\nIf you are looking for adventure-filled travels, from taking volcano-selfies to walking on a wire, here is a roundup of potential final destinations:\n\nScramble up Ambuluwawa Tower in Kandy, Sri Lanka\n\nNot many people have heard of this multi-religious centre, but with a climb of 3567m above sea level, this is not for the faint-hearted.\n\nEdgeWalk in Toronto, Canada\n\nAdventurous visitors walk along a 1.5m wide ledge \u2013 atop the CN Tower\u2019s main pod \u2013 while hoisted 356-metres in the air. The view from above is breathtaking, but we are not sure what will take your breath away, the beauty of Lake Ontario or the fact that you are standing on the edge of a ledge!\n\nRide the world\u2019s steepest roller coaster in Japan\n\nIf you think you have guts of steel you have not met the monstrous Takabisha, the world\u2019s steepest rollercoaster. The main attraction of Fuji-Q Highland theme park is also a Guinness World Record holder. The 43-metre vertical plunge has left many hearts pounding and ready to burst.\n\nREAD: Most terrifying attraction ever?\n\nVisit the Gates of Hell in Derweze, Turkmenista\n\nYou might not believe in the existence of hell but this phenomenon will leave you second-guessing yourself. It turns out an actual 'hellhole' really exists, nevermind the torment part. There is a crater that has been burning for years in the Karakum desert and tourists are flocking to catch a glimpse of the burning sensation.\n\nWATCH: These 10 insane surf spots is basically like knocking at death's door\n\n\n\nVolcano boarding in Nicaragua\n\nDespite the many warnings we received growing up about playing with fire, it seems like many travellers are determined to stick it to their mothers and do it anyway.\n\nVolcano boarding is the art of zooming down a 725-metre active volcano and using your heels to brake. Yes, some boarders have seen themselves being hurled down the bank, so hang on TIGHT!\n\nBungee jump off Bloukrans Bridge\n\nDid it hurt when you fell from heaven? Or jumped off the world's highest bungy bridge? Situated in the Tsitsikamma area of South Africa's beautiful Garden Route, there is no doubt that you will see spectacular views if you can even keep your eyes open.\n\nWATCH: I walked inside this ancient, extinct volcano\n\nAbseil off Table Mountain\n\nThere are many ways to enjoy the panoramic views of Table Mountain but if you really want to set your heart racing, try abseiling. This is the world's highest commercial abseiling point, so you are guaranteed to feel a whirlwind of emotions going down. I'm sure the sense of accomplishment will hopefully be bigger than the fear you feel while dangling off a cliff.\n\nSwim with sharks at Gansbaai\n\nIf the movie Jaws did not make you completely terrified of these sea creatures then try shark-cage diving in Kleinbaai, just next to Gansbaai. Get up close and personal with the endangered sharks in their natural habitat, you will realise how special the animals are while praying one doesn't get into the cage.\n\nREAD: PICS: Would you risk your life on an active railway in Vietnam's Hanoi all for a selfie?\n\nTour Canadian caves\n\nWild Cave Tours in Canmore, Alberta allow you to go far beyond the surface into deep rocks with no handrails, no interior lighting and no manicured walkways as secret passageways will lead you to some interesting finds. Just you and blind faith. Can you handle bumping into a skeleton while you are clambering through the cave? We are not so sure.\n\nThe ultimate trust game?\n\nRelationships require trust then there is letting your boyfriend dangle you over a cliff. This influencer duo has taken #couple goals to another level with their risky photography techniques. It works for them, I think I will stick to trusting my boyfriend to pick me up from work.\n\nREAD UP ON THEM: PICS: This couple can't stop (won't stop) dangling over death-defying cliffs\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
