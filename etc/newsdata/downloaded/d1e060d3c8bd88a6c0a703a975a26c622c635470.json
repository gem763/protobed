The lawsuit sought unspecified damages.\n\nAbout one-fifth of all documents filed in the case were done so under seal, a level of secrecy the second circuit ruled was unjustified. However, the appellate court, in unsealing the records, issued an unusual warning to the public and the media \u201cto exercise restraint\u201d regarding potentially defamatory allegations.", "description": "Unnamed people will be allowed to object to the release of the documents following review, US district judge said", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d860d1d12bb7a9d4d32712e272ce382e6b083f2/292_31_3212_1927/master/3212.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6873ebebbdbe4315f5a0f78502c37af9"}
