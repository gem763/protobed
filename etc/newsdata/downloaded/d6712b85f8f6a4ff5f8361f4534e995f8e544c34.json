Shares in Pfizer rose 3% in premarket trading after the drugmaker raised its financial targets for 2019. Rival Merck gained 2.9% after it, too, boosted its full-year outlook.\n\nShares in Google's parent company, Alphabet, dropped 1.4% in off-hours trading after the technology giant reported mixed third-quarter progress. Climbing online advertising sales were juxtaposed with rising costs and poor performance in its investment portfolio.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 index declined 0.4%, led by losses in financial services and the oil and gas sectors.\n\nThe British pound pared back earlier losses and traded at about $1.29 after the main opposition party in the U.K. said it would support efforts to hold an early general election. That makes a national ballot that might help break the parliamentary deadlock over Prime Minister Boris Johnson's divorce deal with the European Union more likely. The FTSE 250 index declined 0.5%.\n\nIn European equity markets, Fresenius Medical Care and its parent, Fresenius SE, led gains. Shares in the Fresenius Medical rose 5.4% after the maker of products for treating kidney disease posted higher third-quarter profit and revenue. It's German parent climbed 4.9% after the health care company also reporter stronger figures.\n\nAcross Asian markets, the picture was more mixed, with the Nikkei 225 index up 0.5% while the Shanghai Composite gauge was down 0.9%.\n\nBrent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell 1.2% to $60.51 a barrel following data showing rising U.S. inventories Monday. Investors will look at American Petroleum Institute data due out later Tuesday. Remarks by the Russian energy minister to local media on Monday that it was too early to consider production cuts in December are weighing on investor sentiment, according to Commerzbank analysts.\n\nWrite to Anna Isaac at anna.isaac@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 29, 2019 08:06 ET (12:06 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
