It is calling on players to show up to BlizzCon, which starts November 1 in California, to protest against the company\u2019s censorship. The BlizzCon protest is named after the 2014 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cThis is not going away,\u201d said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future said in a statement, \u201cBlizzard, and other companies who are engaging in censorship on behalf of an authoritarian government, are not going to get away with it. They have no idea what kind of Internet shitstorm they\u2019ve unleashed. We\u2019re going to make an example out of them to make sure that all companies know that throwing human rights and free expression under the bus to make some extra money will not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nFight for the Future has successfully organized a host of major protests over the last few years, including some of the internet\u2019s largest pro net neutrality campaigns. Those campaigns included large-scale public commenting campaigns on the FCC\u2019s website, purchasing billboards to shame anti-net neutrality lawmakers, and working to get Congress to support a bill that would restore net neutrality. In recent weeks, the organization has protested Amazon\u2019s Ring partnerships with police, which allow police to obtain footage from Ring home surveillance cameras without a warrant.\n\nThe coalition has set up a Discord to plan the protests. So far, the Discord is relatively small, but Greer said she is hoping people to \u201ccome in cosplay, with signs, creative shirts, etc.\u201d The protest is in the early stages, but Fight for the Future has a proven track record of being able to mobilize lots of people in the name of internet freedom: \u201cSo far we're just announcing it / calling for people to come,\u201d Greer said on Discord. \u201cWe should def figure out all the logistics, location / police liaison / signs and messaging / maybe ridesharing, etc.\u201d\n\nBlizzard employees and gamers have been furious that the company censored a player and seems to be showing deference to the Chinese government. Players have staged mass protests, while employees have been protesting every day on the company\u2019s campus.\n\nMeanwhile, the list of prominent companies that have gone out of their way to censor on behalf of the Chinese government has been growing\u2014mainly because it has been profitable enough to look the other way.", "description": "\"They have no idea what kind of Internet shitstorm they've unleashed,\" the protest's organizers say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da0e09d6b1388000aad5bb9/lede/1570824528259-Screen-Shot-2019-10-11-at-40831-PM.png?crop=1xw:0.8923xh;0xw,0.0243xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
