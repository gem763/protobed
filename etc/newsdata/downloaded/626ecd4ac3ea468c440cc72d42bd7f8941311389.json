Now it's a completely different situation. No one expects us to win again -- but we believe.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "After a sleepless night replaying Japan's historic Rugby World Cup victory over Scotland in his head, captain Michael Leitch has warned quarterfinal opponents South Africa that lightning can strike twice.
