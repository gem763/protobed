Removing drivers is seen as the most direct path to lower costs.\n\nDidi faced heavy scrutiny after two female passengers were killed by drivers in 2018. The company has 33 million drivers and cannot screen and monitor all of them effectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Didi can afford to develop autonomous technology and expand overseas thanks to funding from heavyweight backers, including Softbank, Tencent and Alibaba. It also has partnerships with VW, Toyota, Beijing Auto, Nissan and others.\n\nWhat to watch: Didi plans to push out its self-driving services to other countries rapidly, starting in 2021.\n\nIf Didi demonstrates its self-driving capabilities on Chinese roads, it could meet that goal and see a rise in its most recent valuation of around $57 billion.\n\nMichael Dunne is the CEO of ZoZo Go, an investment advisory firm focusing on Asia and mobility, and the author of \"American Wheels, Chinese Roads.\"", "description": "The Chinese ride-hailing giant hopes to address passenger safety concerns and rising labor costs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/SJLDtmOyoDQrSt4_gWOyoxTiV78=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/17/1571324884892.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
