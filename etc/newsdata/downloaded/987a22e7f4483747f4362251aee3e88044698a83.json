Richarlison had a goal ruled out for offside at the start of the second half and Theo Walcott rattled the crossbar with a volley before Sigurdsson finally doubled the advantage by curling in a shot from just outside the area in stoppage time as the Toffees ended a run of four successive Premier League defeats.\n\nRoberto also denied Tom Davies and Alex Iwobi from close range to keep the score down. Angelo Ogbonna missed West Ham\u2019s best chance for an equalizer in the 82nd when the ball fell to him after a corner but Jordan Pickford saved his shot.\n\nThe win lifts Everton out of the relegation zone with 10 points from nine games, two points behind West Ham.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bernard scored from a tight angle in the first half and substitute Gylfi Sigurdsson added a late second from distance as Everton beat West Ham 2-0 Saturday in the Premier League to ease the pressure on manager Marco Silva.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/britain_soccer_premier_league_13352_c0-110-2683-1675_s1200x700.jpg?d5ef5b3075b8ab03714f65857ed268a3d108f203", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
