You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\n\nAccording to our call of the day from John Mauldin of Mauldin Economics, 2020 \u201cwill be the most volatile year in history\u201d for investors\n\n\u201cThe last few weeks marked a turning point in the global economy. It\u2019s more than the trade war. A sense of vulnerability is replacing the previous confidence \u2014 and with good reason,\u201d he wrote in his latest market update. \u201cWe are vulnerable, and we\u2019ll be lucky to get through the 2020s without major damage.\u201d\n\nMauldin pointed to supply shocks, the trade war, interest rates, unproductive debt and the mess in Europe as just some of the factors poised to create the perfect storm, but it\u2019s one volatility bomb, in particular, that could blow up best-laid plans.\n\n\u201cRemember when experts said to keep politics out of your investment strategy?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe no longer have that choice. Political decisions and election results around the globe now have direct, immediate market consequences.\u201d\n\nOf course, the most consequential of all: The 2020 U.S. election. And Mauldin doesn\u2019t sound too hopeful about any of the scenarios.\n\n\u201cNone of the possible outcomes are particularly good. I think the best we can hope for is continued gridlock,\u201d he said. \u201cBut between now and November 2020, none of us will know the outcome. Instead, a never-ending stream of poll results will show one side or the other has the upper hand.\u201d\n\nMarkets will be a mess, bouncing up and down with each headline, Mauldin warned, and that will inspire politicians and central bankers to react. To \u201cdo something.\u201d That something, he said, will probably be the wrong thing.\n\nThe chart\n\nWhile Mauldin is expecting a nasty stretch, J.C. Parets of the All Star Charts blog is feeling rather bullish on global markets after chewing on the trendlines. From London UKX, -0.28% to South Korea 180721, +0.52% , he\u2019s seeing upside all over the world. But it\u2019s the bright green signal flashing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.26% that has him most optimistic:\n\n\u201cA breakout through 26,700-27,000 could spark a new leg higher, and I believe that is the higher probability outcome,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor the world\u2019s largest and most important markets, I don\u2019t see what there is to be bearish about.\u201d\n\nThe market\n\nFutures on the Dow YM00, +0.24% , Nasdaq NQ00, +0.28% and S&P ES00, +0.29% are all moving slightly higher ahead of the open. Gold GC.1, +0.00% is also in the green as is silver SI00, +0.78%. Oil CL.1, +0.88% is inching higher toward $57 a barrel, with investors eyeing news of a new Saudi oil minister, while the dollar DXY, -0.07% is barely budging.\n\nEurope stocks SXXP, +0.10% are drawing buyer interest early in the session, while Asia markets ADOW, +0.41% ended in positive territory.\n\nThe buzz\n\nApple AAPL, -0.01% is hosting a big event on Tuesday, with fans looking to eat up some news about new iPhones and a new Apple Watch, apparently. Apple might also talk about its streaming TV service, among other things. The company has also been denying it violated Chinese labor laws.\n\nReports that WeWork\u2019s WE, +0.00% IPO is looking rocky just keep coming. Citing sources, and on the heels of similar reports, the WSJ says the company is now considering a valuation below $20 billion. That would be a steep drop from the lofty $47 billion mark where WeWork last raised private capital this year.\n\nHurricane Dorian moved on from the islands and North Carolina (Alabama\u2019s fine) to unleash havoc on far-eastern Canada, with hurricane force weeks that knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of people before weakening late in the day.\n\nThe tweet\n\nJPMorgan has a new index \u2014 called the \u201cVolfefe Index\u201d \u2014 that measures Trump\u2019s tweets and their impact on bond volatility.

Pictures via Associated Press\n\n$91 million \u2014 That\u2019s how much AT&T\u2019s T, +1.00% Warner Bros. said \u201cIt: Chapter Two\u201d earned from North American ticket sales in its first weekend on the silver screen. Only its predecessor earned more for a September release.\n\nThe quote\n\nSpeaking of Stephen King: \u201cIt feels good to be at least semi-respectable. I have outlived most of my most virulent critics. It gives me great pleasure to say that. Does that make me a bad person?\u201d That\u2019s from the \u201cIt\u201d writer\u2019s interview with the Guardian that was published over the weekend.\n\nRandom reads\n\nSick of all the action flicks like I am?
