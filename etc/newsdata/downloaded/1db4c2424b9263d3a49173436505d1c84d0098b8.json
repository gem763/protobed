Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg debuted a new look at Tuesday\u2019s primary debate: that of a moderate pugilist, a combative scold whose engagement with his opponents\u2019 ideas ranged from derisive to dismissive. Adopting a tone that verged on snide, he assailed several of the more left-leaning candidates onstage. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s mandatory assault-rifle buybacks proposal became a \u201cshiny object\u201d from a man Buttigieg \u201c[didn\u2019t] need lessons from \u2026 on courage, political or otherwise\u201d; the details of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Medicare for All plan, marked by her insistence on discussing its funding in terms of costs rather than taxes, were obscured by her evasive responses to \u201ca yes-or-no question that didn\u2019t get a yes-or-no answer\u201d \u2014 behavior, the mayor said, that encapsulates \u201cwhy people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular.\u201d\n\nAs my colleague Gabriel Debenedetti wrote, it\u2019s all part of a strategy to position Buttigieg to benefit if Joe Biden falters. With Warren and Bernie Sanders staking out the primary\u2019s leftward flank, the mayor sees his best hope for securing the nomination \u2014 or at least catapulting himself into a higher polling tier \u2014 in drawing contrasts with them and projecting himself as a younger, more lucid, and less baggage-laden competitor for supporters of the former vice-president: liberal centrists and older black voters. It\u2019s a risky gambit for two reasons. First, Buttigieg\u2019s appeal derives largely from his mild-mannered charm and self-branding as an above-the-fray consensus-builder \u2014 both of which were undermined by his antagonistic behavior on Tuesday. But more crucially, it\u2019s imperiled by his knack for thwarting his own efforts to build relationships with black voters, whose support he\u2019ll need if he\u2019s to seriously challenge Biden, Warren, Sanders, or even Kamala Harris.\n\nThe latest example occurred on Friday, when the Associated Press reported that the mayor was scheduled to attend a fundraiser co-hosted by Steve Patton. As head of Chicago\u2019s law department under former mayor Rahm Emanuel, Patton was a key figure in the administration\u2019s efforts to hide dashcam footage of Laquan McDonald\u2019s killing from the public. The black 17-year-old was shot 16 times in 2014 by then\u2013police officer Jason Van Dyke, who was later convicted of second-degree murder and aggravated battery and sentenced to nearly seven years in prison. Officers at the scene initially lied, saying that McDonald had lunged toward them with a knife. The Emanuel administration pushed to hide video that disputed their account until after the mayor won reelection \u2014 a decision made under Patton\u2019s advisement. When reporters this week drew attention to Patton\u2019s role in the cover-up, and that he\u2019d made a max donation of $5,600 to Buttigieg\u2019s campaign, Buttigieg and his staffers declined to comment, according to the AP. But as public pressure mounted on Friday morning, they abruptly removed Patton as a co-host and refunded his money. \u201cTransparency and justice for Laquan McDonald is more important than a campaign contribution,\u201d Chris Meagher, the Buttigieg campaign\u2019s communications director, told Axios. \u201cWe are returning the money he contributed to the campaign and the money he has collected. He is no longer a co-host for the event and will not be attending.\u201d\n\nButtigieg has criticized promises made by the Warren and Sanders campaigns to refuse high-dollar donations from corporate PACs and lobbyists. \u201cMy competitors can go with whatever strategy they like \u2026 we\u2019re not going to beat [Trump] with pocket change,\u201d he said earlier this week. But ongoing developments showcase the irony of this stance: Buttigieg has attracted less money in donations than either of them, and, until public pressure forced his hand, one of his donors was a central figure in a police shooting cover-up. All of which complicates a campaign that\u2019s already weathered its share of racial controversy, particularly the questions surrounding Buttigieg\u2019s firing of South Bend\u2019s black police chief and the police shooting death of Eric Logan over the summer \u2014 both of which have drawn fiery criticism from black locals. The mayor\u2019s efforts to make nice have come off, to some of them, as superficial and unconvincing. \u201cYou running for president and you expect black people to vote for you?\u201d one woman asked as he addressed a march protesting Logan\u2019s death in June. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for your vote,\u201d Buttigieg replied. \u201cYou ain\u2019t gonna get it either,\u201d the woman said.\n\nBy several accounts, Buttigieg\u2019s once-dismal support numbers among black voters in key primary states, most notably South Carolina, are trending upward, and his black outreach team insists that name recognition is his main barrier to improving them exponentially. But the abrupt tonal shifts displayed during Tuesday\u2019s debate and his ill-advised association with Steve Patton \u2014 paired with his initial decision not to comment when Patton\u2019s role in the Laquan McDonald case was brought to his attention, and only parting ways with him once public pressure made their relationship untenable \u2014 risk creating even more barriers to his efforts to amass black support than his troubles in South Bend had already created. Perhaps more troubling, his newly combative attitude and derision toward progressive positions for which he once professed unequivocal support suggest the kind of boring careerism that fuels the very problems on Capitol Hill that he claims to want to solve. Last-minute efforts to mend the rifts he\u2019s caused with black voters are unlikely to save his campaign. But they do illustrate why his path into Biden supporters\u2019 hearts is rockier than he might have estimated.", "description": "Mayor Pete Buttigieg caved to public pressure on Friday and parted ways with Steve Patton, the Chicago lawyer who helped Rahm Emmanuel delay release of the Laquan McDonald shooting video, and who was hosting a fundraiser for the South Bend mayor.", "authors": ["Zak Cheney-Rice"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/18/18-pete-buttigieg.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
