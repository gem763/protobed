The Jurassic World star shared a photo of the meal scorched by his bride-of-four-months, revealing the charred remains of a popular (and easy) snack food: Bagel Bites. Schwarzenegger has many talents, but cooking doesn\u2019t appear to be one of them.\n\nPratt took to Instagram to playfully prod his wife about the dinner mishap. \u201cProud of my darling for trying to cook tonight. Did it go well? No. No, it did not. Not at all. To quote Rocky Balboa, \u2018It\u2019s not how many times you get knocked down, it\u2019s how many times you get up\u2026 and keep moving forward.\u2019 As you can tell from the lump of coal in the center of the plate, this bagel bite never stood a chance,\u201d he said.\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nHe continued, \u201cI honestly simply cannot imagine what went wrong here. Pretty simple. Microwave. 2 minutes. Maybe she thought it said 2 hours. But I want to commend her for her effort. This is a big step babe. Proud of you.\u201d Hilariously, Schwarzenegger\u2019s little brother Patrick Schwarzenegger commented on the post, writing only, \u201cSmh @katherineschwarzenegger.\u201d\n\nHer cooking skills (or lack thereof) aren\u2019t the only thing earning Schwarzenegger some light-hearted needling lately. Earlier this month, the pair\u2019s pal Rob Lowe poked fun at her golf game. When asked about spending a day playing the sport with both Pratt and Schwarzenegger, Lowe said, \u201cI\u2019m always third-wheeling. I\u2019m a professional third wheeler. It\u2019s just my lot in life. But no, I don\u2019t think Katherine\u2019s golf game is up to snuff, so we don\u2019t need to worry about that. It\u2019s still a guy\u2019s escape.\u201d\n\nSchwarzenegger didn\u2019t debate her lack of golfing prowess. During an appearance on Today With Hoda & Jenna after the third-wheel outing, she admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t golf well.\u201d So, something tells us she doesn\u2019t harbor any illusions about her cooking either. But hey, as Pratt pointed out, just firing up that microwave is forward progress.\n\nBest of SheKnows\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.
