Reid is a former police officer turned consultant who spearheaded the \u2018Reid Technique\u2019 interrogation method, and has been teaching it since 1974 to clients (according to his lawsuit) including the FBI, US military and police departments.\n\nThe show follows the case of the Central Park Five (Picture: Netflix)\n\nHis company, John E. Reid and Associates, Inc, have took particular umbrage with a scene in the final episode, where a discussion takes place between Manhattan assistant D.A. Nancy Ryan (Famke Janssen) and a New York City detective involved in abstracting confessions from the accused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this scene, Ryan\u2019s partner says: \u2018You squeezed statements out of them after 42 hours of questioning and coercing, without food, bathroom breaks, withholding parental supervision. The Reid Technique has been universally rejected. That\u2019s truth to you.\u2019\n\nThe lawsuit (available here) is strongly against the idea the Reid Technique has been \u2018universally rejected\u2019 \u2013 and claims it has been falsely represented by being associated with these attributes.\n\n\u2018The program falsely represents that squeezing and coercing statements from juvenile subjects after long hours of questioning without food, bathroom breaks or parental supervision is synonymous with the Reid Technique,\u2019 the lawsuit states.\n\nMetro.co.uk reached out to Netflix who had no comment.\n\nConsidering the show doesn\u2019t explicitly mention John Reid\u2019s company, it\u2019s questionable how far the lawsuit will go \u2013 although it does state the Reid Technique is a trademark which could give it more legitimacy.\n\nWhen They See Us earned 16 nominations at this year\u2019s Emmys, with actor Jharell Jerome picking up the award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series.\n\nYou can catch When They See Us streaming on Netflix.\n\nMORE: What does El Camino mean following the new Breaking Bad movie\u2019s Netflix release?\n\nMORE: Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston to reunite for Murder Mystery sequel on Netflix", "description": "When They See Us has been hit with a defamation lawsuit for an unlikely issue.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/when-they-see-us-2-6fea_1571123745.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
