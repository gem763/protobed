When they block the Alstom-Siemens merger,\u201d Roux de B\u00e9zieux said, pushing for a reform of competition rules that he called \u201cobsolete.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would like a French commissioner [to be nominated] quickly and for them to keep this portfolio that made a lot of sense\" \u2014 Geoffroy Roux de B\u00e9zieux, president of Medef\n\n\u201cWe need a Commission that gives a new impulse, that launches projects of direct interest for entrepreneurs, that facilitates the development and prosperity of our businesses,\u201d he added.\n\nRoux de B\u00e9zieux also said he \u201cregretted\u201d Goulard\u2019s rejection by the European Parliament, which prompted an angry response by French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t issue a political judgment over the Parliament\u2019s decision, as that [rejecting Goulard] is its prerogative, but \u2026 it gives the impression that political games prevail over the necessity to act,\u201d he added, embracing Paris\u2019 narrative on the episode.\n\nGoulard fallout\n\nMacron blamed political group leaders for the rejection of his nominee and publicly demanded an explanation from Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen, while French officials hinted at petty revenge after the Parliament felt side-tracked during negotiations over top EU jobs earlier this year.\n\nEuropean lawmakers countered that Goulard was simply held to the same standards that led her to quit her former ministerial post in France over allegations of misuse of Parliament funds, with scrutiny of a highly paid consulting job adding to MEPs\u2019 ethical concerns.\n\nParis, which has yet to put forward a new nominee, is now focusing its efforts on preserving the powerful portfolio secured for Goulard, spanning the EU's internal market, the defense industry, space and digital policy.\n\n\u201cWe would like a French commissioner [to be nominated] quickly and for them to keep this portfolio that made a lot of sense,\u201d Roux de B\u00e9zieux said.\n\nReforming EU competition rules\n\nOn substance, the Medef boss said the EU should now focus on designing and implementing a beefed-up industrial policy \u2014 but not without reviewing its competition rules.\n\n\u201cIn France, [the Alstom-Siemens block] has become among business leaders \u2026 the symbol of part of the Brussels world turning a blind eye on what\u2019s at stake in Europe\u2019s industrial policy,\u201c he said.\n\nThe high-profile block generated a lot of outrage in Paris and Berlin, prompting both capitals to call for a rethink of the EU\u2019s competition rules and a more defensive industrial strategy, including through public funding, to forge European champions ready to take on American or Chinese rivals.\n\n\"Europe needs to be able to better defend its interests,\" Roux de B\u00e9zieux said, referring among other things to bullish negotiating tactics used by U.S. President Donald Trump on trade. \"Otherwise public opinions that are already extremely defiant toward global trade will become even more so.\"\n\nOn competition specifically, he said: \u201cThe rulebook is obsolete. So it needs to be updated,\u201d echoing calls coming from Germany to rethink European merger and state aid rules.\n\n\u201cNothing personal,\u201d he added, but \u201c[Competition Commissioner Margrethe] Vestager applied a doctrine that was conceived ... at the end of the 1970s and beginning of the 1980s.\u201d\n\nRoux de B\u00e9zieux said the Commission\u2019s competition department shouldn\u2019t decide alone on high-stakes mergers. \u201cThere must be an interaction between the competition logic and the industrial logic.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompetition rules don\u2019t make it a crime to be big\" \u2014 Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition enforcer\n\nGerman industry group BDI earlier this year called on the EU to take new measures to tackle \u201ccompetition-distorting investments from abroad\u201d and create \u201cguidelines for the participation of foreign bidders in the EU procurement market,\u201d also known as reciprocity rules, a long-standing demand from France.\n\nTo its detractors, however, a more protectionist European model including laxer competition rules carries the risk of undermining competition in the internal market at the expense of European consumers, and skewing the game by picking winners instead of pushing everyone to innovate.\n\nIn her recent hearing at the European Parliament, Vestager, who is set to become vice president in charge of digital and retain her competition portfolio, supported the push on public procurement and the need for a new approach to China, but warned against throwing competition rules under the bus.\n\n\u201cCompetition rules don\u2019t make it a crime to be big,\u201d she said. \"Companies are also free to merge \u2014 just as long as they still remain subject to challenge. Because companies cannot deny consumers the benefits of effective competition: affordable prices, a choice of products, and innovation in products to serve their needs better.\u201d", "description": "Head of business lobby Medef says Europe needs \u2018to better defend its interests\u2019 to face Chinese and US rivals.", "authors": ["Marion Solletty", "Nicholas Vinocur", "Charlie Cooper", "Louise Guillot"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1166066724-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
