The new footage shows Anduril\u2019s system taking down both a fixed wing drone and an opposing quadcopter, which looks to be a knock-off of the DJI Phantom.\n\nThe drone (dubbed \u201cAnvil\u201d) is designed to take out enemies from below, with the battery and motors optimized for short, fast flights. It\u2019s also designed to take the impact and survive: the rotors are on the bottom, and all of the flight-critical components are positioned as low as possible. So even if some of the more delicate equipment is damaged, the Anvil should be able to land in one piece.\n\nNone of this will do much to reassure concerns about Anduril\u2019s border project, which many saw as a nightmare of Trump-era automated surveillance. But Anvil is designed for use by the military rather than border agencies, and it\u2019s not clear if it would be much use at the border. Based on the vertical angle of attack \u2014 which is essential to the drone\u2019s layout \u2014 it\u2019s also hard to imagine the system being very effective against a human being.\n\nFunctionally, the biggest concern is that Anvil will sustain too much damage with each impact, making it too expensive to work as a long-term countermeasure. But rogue quadcopters are a newly plausible threat for the military, and there aren\u2019t many solutions that don\u2019t involve large-scale jamming emplacements. If Anvil can make a case that it\u2019s the best option, it could make a lot more sense than the company\u2019s border-vision plans.\n\nUpdate 4:22PM ET: Updated with a more condensed version of the video.", "description": "New footage shows Anduril\u2019s system taking down both a fixed wing drone and an opposing quadcopter, in a move designed to protect army bases.", "authors": ["Russell Brandom", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KaTr5EFO9nkgf31rti1MpRk-5tI=/0x36:2780x1491/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19259791/Screen_Shot_2019_10_04_at_12.39.55_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
