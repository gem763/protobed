U.S. officials, though, did provide a heads-up to Russia and other nations with military forces in the region. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News that he discussed the operation Saturday night with his Russian counterpart.\n\nWatch: Aerial footage shows aftermath of raid on ISIS leader:\n\nAerial footage of village where U.S. raid targeted ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi 1:10\n\nTrump's move this month to withdraw most U.S. forces from Syria \u2014 and in the process clear the way for a Turkish assault on Kurdish fighters allied with the U.S. \u2014 came as a shock to Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill.\n\nAl-Baghdadi 'died like a coward'\n\nAl-Baghdadi, the shadowy leader of ISIS, presided over its global jihad and became arguably the world's most-wanted man. He led ISIS for the last five years, presiding over its ascendancy as it cultivated a reputation for beheadings and attracted hundreds of thousands of followers to a sprawling and self-styled caliphate in Iraq and Syria.\n\nHe remained among the few ISIS commanders still at large despite multiple claims in recent years about his death and even as his so-called caliphate dramatically shrank, with many supporters who joined the cause imprisoned.\n\nHe was targeted in Syria's northwestern Idlib province, in the Barisha area, late Saturday. Trump announced the raid Sunday at the White House, saying the ISIS leader detonated a suicide vest during the operation, killing himself and three of his children.\n\nAl-Baghdadi \"died like a coward, crying, whimpering and screaming\" as he ran to hide inside a tunnel, with U.S. troops closing in on him, Trump said Sunday. He said two wives of the ISIS leader, \"both wearing vests,\" were also found dead in the rubble of the tunnel.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. Secretary of Defence Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, provided an update at the Pentagon on what they dubbed a multi-year, multi-agency effort to bring down Al-Baghdadi.\n\nAsked about Trump's description of Al-Baghdadi's death, Milley said he did not know the source of the president's description of him \"whimpering and screaming,\" but said he assumed those details came from military leaders on the ground.\n\nVideo and images from the operation are being declassified, Milley added.\n\nNo U.S. service personnel were killed in the operation, Esper said, and two adult males were taken into U.S. custody. Neither Esper nor Milley would elaborate on the men in custody or on the material they said was seized during the operation.\n\nListen to The Rise and Fall of ISIS Leader al-Baghdadi on Front Burner:\n\nOn Sunday President Donald Trump announced that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died during a U.S. raid in Syria. Today on Front Burner, Joby Warrick explains the significance of Baghdadi\u2019s death and what this means for the future of ISIS. Warrick is a national security reporter for the Washington Post and Pulitzer-prize winning author of Black Flags: The Rise Of ISIS. 23:36\n\nThe operation's success could prove a major boost for Trump. The recent pullback of U.S. troops he ordered from northeastern Syria raised a storm of bipartisan criticism in Washington that the militant group could regain strength, after it had lost vast stretches of territory it had once controlled.\n\nDuring an event in Chicago Monday, Trump called Al-Baghdadi \" a sick and depraved man\" who should have been killed years ago.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump is suggesting House Democrats' impeachment probe contributed to his decision to withhold notice to congressional leaders before Saturday's raid on Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5115765.1572186316!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
