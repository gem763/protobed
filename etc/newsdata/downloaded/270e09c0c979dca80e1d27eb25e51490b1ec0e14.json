Brennan\u2019s responsibility for criminal leaks during the Obama administration\u2019s investigation of Trump has been obvious for at least two years. Even Trump hater Peter Strzok, the FBI liaison to John Brennan, couldn\u2019t believe the leaks coming out of his shop. Referring to Brennan\u2019s agents as \u201csisters,\u201d Strzok said to his mistress Lisa Page, \u201cour sisters have begun leaking like mad. Scorned and worried and political, they\u2019re kicking in to overdrive.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cleaking like mad\u201d began in the thick of the 2016 campaign, as the feverishly partisan John Brennan sought to sabotage Donald Trump before Election Day. Has John Durham, the U.S. attorney assigned to the probe of the Obama administration\u2019s spying on Trump, talked to Harry Reid about Brennan\u2019s leaking? He should. Recall Brennan\u2019s blatant disclosure of classified information about the investigation to the former Nevada senator in the late summer/early fall of 2016. Reid has told reporters that Brennan used him as the conduit for that leak against Trump during the campaign: \u201cWhy do you think he called me?\u201d\n\nIn other words, Brennan knew damn well that he was criminally leaking to a fellow anti-Trump partisan. That\u2019s enough to indict him right there. Reid, of course, was happy to broadcast the leak to the media, but even he found Brennan\u2019s \u201culterior motive\u201d for a senatorial briefing a little odd, as he explained to David Corn and Michael Isikoff in their book Russian Roulette. Corn and Isikoff write that Reid \u201chad concluded the CIA chief believed the public needed to know about the Russian operation, including the information about the possible links to the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\nBrennan has said that the widening probe \u201cconcerns\u201d him. It should. He is guilty as hell. The news that his subordinates are lawyering up suggests that he is perhaps hoping that one of those saps takes the fall for him. But the fact remains that he conducted the briefing with Reid in the hopes of dirtying up Trump before election day.\n\nDurham could also nail Brennan for perjury \u2014 his most obvious whopper being his denial before Congress of knowledge of the Hillary-financed Christopher Steele dossier. Reid had told Brennan about the Steele dossier in the summer of 2016. So, too, did Steele\u2019s old colleagues in British intelligence, whose well-publicized role in feeding Brennan information about alleged Trump\u2013Russia ties depended at least in part on Steele\u2019s recycled yarns. Peter Strzok, to whom Brennan gave a special CIA award, would have also alerted him to Steele\u2019s role in Crossfire Hurricane.\n\nThe same demented political animus driving Brennan now drove him before the election. Through leaks to the press, he made it clear to Hillary Clinton that he wanted to remain as CIA director under her. In the last months of the campaign, Brennan was in effect auditioning for her. He had hoped his October surprise with Harry Reid would win him her enduring affection.\n\nThe problem was that he didn\u2019t have much to give Reid, apart from the existence of the investigation itself and the half-baked \u201cintelligence\u201d he had picked up from foreign counterparts in Britain, Estonia, and elsewhere. That\u2019s why Brennan and Comey had to concoct the harebrained scheme of using a Cambridge intellectual on the make, Stefan Halper, to try and entrap George Papadopoulos. With Election Day bearing down on them in September 2016, they ran Halper in again to the Trump campaign, who came up empty. (Halper had also been trying to entrap Carter Page.)\n\nSpygate is an immensely complicated tale. It would take a special counsel to unravel it all and indict all the bad guys. But Republicans don\u2019t have the stomach for a special counsel. And so we are left with the hope that John Durham will at least hook a few big fish like Brennan.\n\nThat the media is freaking out over the news of Durham hiring more lawyers and receiving more resources from Bill Barr can be taken as a promising sign. The more noise they make, the closer Durham gets to the truth \u2014 a truth future historians will prize for its rich irony: that the government that tried the hardest to throw the election was our own.", "description": "Former CIA director John Brennan calls the Justice Department\u2019s widening probe into Spygate\u2019s origins \u201cbizarre.\u201d It has no \u201clegal basis,\u201d he bleats.
