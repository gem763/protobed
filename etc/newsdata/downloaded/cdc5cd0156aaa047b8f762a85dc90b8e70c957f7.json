The Wolf can handle it. Don't know the first thing about hiring new engineers? Just call The Wolf. Maybe you have late-night thoughts on your company's next move and want to talk it out. Never fear, The Wolf is here.\"\n\nOpting for at least some difference from the Tarantino character, Kalanick had a different nickname in mind, Isaac reports. He even set up a twitter account, @KonaTBone, for \"musings and controversial aphorisms.\"\n\nThe account is now private, with 30 followers, but snapshots accessed via the Wayback Machine show a simpler time in Kalanick's life.\n\n\"Tbones back,\" he tweeted in around 1:30 am on October 2007, before launching into what appears to be a night of revelry.\n\n\"Tbones skollin those mutha f\u2014s on the danc e floor yo,\" he tweeted about an hour later. Finally, by about 4 am, the night appears to have ended with a final \"KTB Is oooowwwwwwwwuuuuuuuuttttttte.\" (The next day involved a headache and a trip back to San Francisco, apparently.)\n\nAt the time of publication, Business Insider's request to follow the steak-emblazoned KonaTBone Twitter account was still pending.\n\nRead more from 'Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber':", "description": "In the days before Uber, Kalanick fancied himself a \"fixer,\" a la Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction,\" according to a new book out Tuesday.", "authors": ["Graham Rapier"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6e76422e22af26de5869c9-750-375.jpg"}
