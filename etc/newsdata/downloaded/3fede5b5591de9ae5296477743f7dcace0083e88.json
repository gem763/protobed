In an area dominated by lifestyle-focused businesses not to mention bloggers, the local property market demands homes that come equipped with energy-efficient features such as solar panels.\n\nSo while we know that in real-life Hemsworth does support environmental causes, he and Pataky are also savvy enough to realise that solar panels are the new water tanks when it comes to features that buyers want \u2013 they not only bring down the cost of running a home, but they make that property more attractive to future buyers.\n\nEnergy-efficient homes becoming the norm\n\nOver the three years up to the end of August 2019, around 10,565 listings on realestate.com.au had energy efficient in the description and 60% of those listings were for newly-built properties.\n\nBuyers and investors in Queensland, in particular, search the most for homes with solar panels and air conditioning.\n\nUnsurprisingly, searches for properties with solar panels particularly on realestate,.com.au peak in the warmer months.\n\nThe CSIRO estimates that energy-efficient features added to Australian homes \u2013 particularly newly-built ones- since 2001 have saved home owners at least $560 a year in power bills and cut back energy usage by 2.3tonnes of CO,2 while at the same time the size of our homes has grown to an average of 132sqm.\n\nOver 60% of the newly-built homes assessed using the CSIRO criteria in Queensland were deemed to have an energy rating of 6-6.5 stars compared the average rating of 1.8 stars when the rating system began in 2001.\n\nThe findings don\u2019t surprise realestate.com.au chief economist Nerida Conisbee who says there are three main drivers when it comes to the popularity of solar panels and more energy-efficient features in the home.\n\n\u201cSomewhere like Queensland, people have to use a lot of energy to cool their homes so things like air conditioning are more important and people are more likely to have things that need a lot of electricity, like a swimming pool for example.\n\n\u201cThen there are isolated regional areas where it is vital because access to energy is patchy and things like solar panels become really important because you may not necessarily have reliable power coming off a grid.\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s energy efficiency where things like solar panels are more important in places like Canberra because home owners are perhaps more environmentally aware and environmentally conscious \u2013 those are the three drivers,\u201d she says.\n\nConisbee says changes in technology in the near future that make adding solar panels even cheaper an easier plus government incentives will mean more existing homes get retrofitted with panels and other energy-efficient features.\n\n\u201cSolar panels already are more common because you do have a real drive for new homes to be more energy-efficient.\n\n\u201cFor existing homes, that\u2019s where governments and energy pricing will play a bigger role,\u201d she says. \u201cI can see a rising proportion of homes having solar panels.\u201d", "description": "Aussie actor Chris Hemsworth, best known for playing the god of thunder Thor on the big screen, isn't the only home owner looking to harness the power of the sun.", "authors": ["Danielle Cahill"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/02150811/capi_da4da53d0e5c8228b7d21029aa15f5e9_173eefae95821d5831f6d99d839be8b9.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-04-02"}
