The Japan Meteorological Agency released an assessment three minutes after the tremor to confirm that there was no threat of a tsunami and there were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nThe magnitude 9 earthquake and the tsunami that it triggered in March 2011 are still fresh in the memories of most Japanese, and it is fortunate that Saturday\u2019s quake was not more serious. Out in force to respond to the typhoon, emergency services and the Japanese military could have been stretched beyond breaking point if they were also required to cope with victims of yet another tragedy.\n\nIn the last decade, Japan has experienced some of the most extreme weather conditions and catastrophic natural disasters anywhere on the planet. And as a result, the country's civil protection and monitoring agencies are among the busiest in the world.", "description": "As Super Typhoon Hagibis bore down on Japan on Saturday - the most violent storm to strike in more than 80 years - the country was rattled on another front by a magnitude 5.", "authors": ["Julian Ryall", "Robert Tombs", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon", "Telegraph View"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212791367-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqRSrNBdps_hVSiPpQMZeFyVVse9JsN00kzbUr3IXHaGo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
