The last polls in 2014 were marred by allegations of rigging.\n\nDays ahead of the election, the Trump administration cut $160 million in direct funding to Afghan authorities, citing corruption.\n\n- 5G scrutiny -\n\nAt the NATO meeting, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper drove home Washington's assessment of \"the threat a more assertive China presents to the alliance,\" more so than Russia or Iran.\n\nWhile it was not clear the extent other allies shared that view, part of the two-day meeting was given over to NATO members updating \"baseline requirements\" for introducing 5G telecoms networks.\n\nEsper said he made plain his country's objections to allies using Chinese company Huawei, a cost-effective pioneer in the 5G roll-out, stressing that \"the alliance relies on secure communications for intelligence-sharing and military mobility\".\n\nStoltenberg said the baseline update was part of NATO's scrutiny of sensitive civilian infrastructure and was necessary because, in terms of telecoms, \"the old guidelines didn't address 5G at all\" and cyberattacks and dangers from foreign ownership or control of networks had grown.\n\nHe said that the revision was \"not about a specific country or a specific company\" but more about establishing \"requirements that all allies have to meet\".", "description": "NATO will keep reshaping its deployment in Afghanistan to ensure it is \"sustainable,\" the transatlantic alliance's chief said Friday, as members reaffirmed their commitment to the long-running mission.
