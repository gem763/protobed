Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) called the president\u2019s move \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201cunnerving to its core,\u201d while Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade said the decision was \u201cdisastrous\u201d as it would leave the Kurds to fend for themselves.\n\nAmid the criticism from his supporters and fellow Republicans, Trump defended pulling out of Syria while adding that in his \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom\u201d he would destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if they did anything he considered to be off limits.", "description": "The ultra-conservative televangelist on Monday joined a growing chorus of Republican critics of Trump\u2019s decision on Syria.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_768,w_1366,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570481090/pat_robertson_syria_yrsqxn", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
