Sean Casten (D-IL) was confronted by a woman who \u201ctore into\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), accusing them of \u201clying their little butts off,\u201d according to a report by Politico.\n\nShe said the whistleblower complaint \u201clooks like a bunch of 13-year-old girls gossiping.\u201d\n\nAt another event, another constituent asked Casten why he was not condemning former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s actions. Trump has said Biden and his son Hunter Biden should be investigated for their actions in Ukraine. Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the chief prosecutor, who had opened a corruption investigation on a Ukrainian gas company that employed his son for over $50,000 a month. The Bidens have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nCasten has told his constituents that there\u2019s \u201cno there thereon the Biden story,\u201d and that a voter who asked him about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election was espousing a \u201cdeep-down-the-rabbit-hole, crazy conspiracy theory,\u201d according to Politico.\n\nFox River Grove resident Steven Wood said he remains convinced that Trump did nothing wrong. He and his wife had a heated exchange with Casten, after the lawmaker called Trump\u2019s immigration policies \u201cracist\u201d and his claims about Biden \u201ccrackpot conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nRep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), another Democrat in a Republican-leaning district, has also been confronted at town halls back home.\n\nAccording to a report from the Detroit News, Slotkin\u2019s recent support of an impeachment inquiry has raised \u201ca cacophony of applause, boos and mingled shouts of \u2018Let her speak\u2019 and \u2018Fake news,'\u201d at crowded gatherings.\n\nA former Republican precinct delegate, Gwen Bliss, said she is disgruntled by Slotkin\u2019s impeachment support.\n\n\u201cI hope she understands that when she puts herself forward as our representative that she represents us and, if we are this divided about this issue, I wouldn\u2019t go forward with any of this,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother resident, Bill Long, urged Slotkin to instead wait for more facts to emerge. He told her:\n\nThis is a serious matter that I think you guys are treating too lightly. Plus, frankly, if you guys go ahead and impeach him, we may never have this meeting again because you might be out of here and be replaced by a Republican. That would be sad because you seem like a bright young lady.\n\nAlready two Republicans have declared challenges to Slotkin since she came out in support of impeachment last month, State Board of Education member Nikki Snyder of Dexter and auto dealership general sales manager Mike Detmer.\n\nSome Democrats are trying to avoid talking about the issue back home altogether.\n\nRep. Ben McAdams (D-UT) \u2014 who supports an impeachment inquiry \u2014 declined on Thursday to comment on impeachment, then released an ambiguous written statement, but was then forced to clarify his position as he visited a senior center, according to a report by the Salt Lake Tribune.\n\nHe reportedly made two attempts at stating his position, before exiting \u201camid shouts from constituents\u201d at an event on Friday. He had initially not intended to take questions from the media, saying he preferred to focus on health and wellness.\n\n\u201cWe have other work to do,\u201d he reportedly said, \u201cand we can not allow this issue to paralyze a Washington that is already low on results.\u201d\n\nRep. Jared Golden (D-ME) has refused to say whether he thinks the president should be impeached.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with anyone that is rushing to conclusions or making assumptions,\u201d he said at an event, according to the Press Herald. \u201cThis needs to be a fact-finding mission for the good of our country.\u201d\n\nRep. Susan Wild (D-PA) has been also trying to avoid the topic of impeachment.\n\nAt a Teamsters Local 773 meeting in Lehigh Valley, she tried to push back against the idea that Democrats are \u201cliving, breathing and foaming at the mouth for impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get really testy on this when people say that, because I spend 90% of my committee time in education and labor,\u201d she said, according to NPR.\n\nShe said \u201cnot a single person\u201d has asked her about impeachment at any of her events back home.\n\nDavid Potter, a Trump supporter, said he may vote for Wild, but said if she is for impeachment, he will vote for the Republican.\n\n\u201cBecause if you\u2019re going to basically fight against the president when his goal is to make America great, then you should come up with a plan to make America great and not try to, you know, get in a fight with the president,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats hope to carry Georgia for the first time since Bill Clinton\u2019s election in 1992, but they may have a tough time with Republicans like Bill Schilleci, a resident in Forsyth County in Georgia\u2019s 7th district.\n\nHe told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \u201cThis impeachment thing started before Donald Trump put his hand on the Bible.\u201d\n\nRep. Lucy McBath (D-GA) decided to support an impeachment inquiry last month, drawing protests outside of her office.\n\n\u201cDemocrats like Lucy McBath have been looking for any excuse they could find \u2014 no matter how baseless or ridiculous \u2014 to impeach the president,\u201d said Stewart Bragg, the executive director of the state Republican Party.\n\n\u201cIt is outrageous and disgusting. So let\u2019s do something about it.\u201d\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "House Democrats in red states who have come out in support of impeachment are having a rough time defending their decision back home.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/House-Democrats--640x335.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
