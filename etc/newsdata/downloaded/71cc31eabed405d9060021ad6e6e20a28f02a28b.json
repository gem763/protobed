That would be well above the ECB\u2019s key rate, which will drop to minus 0.5%.\n\nBehind this divergence: The U.S. economy is stronger than the eurozone\u2019s, which means there is less reason for the Fed to boost growth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an enviable situation to be in to have negative interest rates,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities. \u201cEurope has negative rates because the economy is weak.\u201d\n\nHere are five charts that highlight the differences in the two economies.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nFirst, overall economic growth has been stronger in the U.S. than in Europe since mid-2017. While growth faltered in the eurozone beginning in the first quarter of 2018, it has remained solid in the U.S.\n\nInflation\n\nA central bank\u2019s main job is to maintain slow and steady inflation to keep the economy humming along. The Fed targets a 2% rate while the ECB seeks a level close to but just under 2%. Inflation has been weak in both economies lately but it has come closer to the Fed\u2019s goal.\n\nManufacturing\n\nThe global economic slowdown has had a bigger effect on manufacturing in the eurozone, which is more export-driven. That has contributed to Europe\u2019s weakening economy and helped spur the ECB\u2019s latest move.\n\nBorrowing Costs\n\nFaced with the sluggish economy, European investors are seeking safety in European government bonds, pushing up their prices. That, combined with the large portfolio the ECB has accumulated through its asset purchases, has pulled yields in several eurozone countries into negative territory, well below the yield on U.S. government debt. Bond yields fall as prices rise.\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe stronger U.S. economy has attracted investment from overseas. That has pushed up the value of the dollar against other currencies, including the euro.\n\nPresident Trump has criticized the Fed for not cutting rates more to weaken the dollar, which would benefit American exporters. He pressed the Fed in a tweet Wednesday to cut short-term rates to \u201c\u201cZERO, or less.\u201d\n\nBut the relatively solid U.S. economy means that could be risky. It could cause the economy to overheat and inflate dangerous asset bubbles that might burst and harm the economy.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell said this month the U.S. economy \u201cis in a good place,\u201d adding that the central bank would \u201cact as appropriate\u201d to keep the expansion going. But the U.S. economy\u2019s resilience means the Fed is unlikely to push rates below zero soon.\n\nRelated Video Speaking on a panel in Switzerland in early September, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the Fed isn\u2019t expecting a recession and that the U.S. economy is in a good place.
