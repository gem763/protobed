But he warned that if he moved forward with his campaign, \u201cthere is a risk that my name would appear on ballots even if a moderate Democrat wins the nomination, and that is not a risk I am willing to take.\u201d\n\nMr. Schultz said in January in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview that he was weighing a \u201ccentrist independent\u201d candidacy and ripped both major political parties, saying President Trump was unqualified to be president while condemning Democrats\u2019 policies.\n\nThe 66-year-old executive decided to put his exploratory process on hold in June amid concerns that he might help re-elect the president.\n\nMr. Schultz\u2019s decision to not seek the presidency was first reported by Axios.\n\nMr. Schultz also noted in the letter that he was recovering from a back injury and three surgeries, which had prevented him from continuing his travels \u201cand engaging with people to the degree that is necessary.\u201d\n\nMr. Schultz had signaled plans to spend more than $100 million on his campaign but said in the letter \u201cthe money that I was prepared to commit to a presidential campaign will instead be used to invest in people, organizations and ideas that promote honesty, civility and results in our politics.\u201d\n\nSince Mr. Schultz first expressed interest in challenging Mr. Trump, Democrats had warned that it could siphon away crucial votes in next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nIn the past, independent and third-party presidential candidates have hurt the chances of major-party candidates without coming close to winning the White House.\n\nTexas oilman H. Ross Perot won 19% of the national popular vote in 1992 but failed to carry any states. His campaign focusing on reducing the national debt helped contribute in part to the defeat of President George H.W. Bush. Democrat Bill Clinton was elected president that year with 43% of the popular vote.\n\nIn 2000, Green Party candidate Ralph Nader challenged Vice President Al Gore from the political left. Many Democrats still blame Mr. Nader for costing Mr. Gore close races in Florida and other states that swung the election to Republican President George W. Bush.\n\nWrite to Ken Thomas at ken.thomas@wsj.com", "description": "Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has abandoned his potential independent bid for president, citing fears among the public that such a candidacy might lead to the re-election of a \u2018uniquely dangerous\u2019 president.", "authors": ["Ken Thomas", "Ken.Thomas Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104577/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
