Crab fights off a hungry seagull by pinching its neck and refusing to let go", "language": "en", "text": "Advertisement\n\nA defiant crab fought back against a hungry seagull after it tried to grab it and carry it off to eat.\n\nThe gull had swooped underwater to seize the crustacean, but the crab fought back by pinching the bird on the neck.\n\nAs the gull hopped in pain, the crab refused to let go and clung onto its attacker as the bird began to fly away.\n\nThe seagull made its move on the crab when it dipped its head underwater and plucked it out with its beak as it stood in the shallow edge of the Atlantic on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.\n\nPinchy: The hungry seagull got its comeuppance when a crab refused to be dinner and clamped onto the bird's neck after it was plucked out of the water\n\nThe seagull could be seen dipping its head under water and pulling the crab from the shallow part of the sea, then trying to carry it away\n\nOn guard: The grab launched its fight back against the seagull in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, as the pair battled it out in the shallow water of the Atlantic Ocean\n\nBut the crab quickly latched onto the bird's chest with its large claw, leaving it swinging from side-to-side as the herring gull hopped from one foot to the other.\n\nEventually the crab dropped off and fell back into the water to safety after releasing the bewildered gull.\n\nMolecular genetics researcher and wildlife photographer, Anastasia Grigorenko, caught the hilarious sequence of images while visiting the Great Island trail in August.\n\nThe 46-year-old said: 'It was quite a painful experience for the seagull.\n\nBut the crab refused to be the bird's diner and quickly latched onto the bird's chest with a large claw, leaving it swinging from side to side as the herring gull hops from one foot to the other\n\nAfter tussling with the gull, eventually the crab dropped off and fell back into the water to safety after releasing the bewildered bird\n\nGetting crabby: As the seagull flew away the crustacean clamped on the bird and held on. The battle of wills was described by photographer, Anastasia Grigorenko, as 'intense'\n\nGrigorenko added: 'Birds are my favorite animal to photograph because it's a great challenge and simply birds are so beautiful'\n\n'It was quite an intense battle between a hungry seagull and a poor crab, who refused to be a victim and started to attack the seagull.\n\n'I am sure it was a very good strategy that has helped crab to save his life many times in the past. The seagull was totally exhausted at the end.\n\n'I was intrigued to see some action. I actually saw it in detail only later on my computer.\n\n'Many people said things like 'Crab 1, seagull 0', 'Great shots!' and 'Who caught who?'.'\n\n'Crab 1, seagull 0': The gull thought it had caught a tasty snack, until its prey latched onto its throat and refused to let go\n\nAnastasia Grigorenko added: 'I personally prefer images of a beautiful birds with a perfect light and smooth background, people like action and funny shots a lot'\n\nHowever capturing the amusing incident was not the photographer's original intention, as she had been aiming to take snaps of the birds against the sunset.\n\nAnastasia, from Moscow, Russia, said: 'I was just walking on the trail, but I always take my camera with me.\n\n'I was expecting to take other images of seagulls feeding at sunset.\n\n'Seagulls like to drop clams from some height to crack open them. I was waiting for the right moment to practice a vertical panning.", "description": "The seagull made its move on the crab when it dipped its head underwater and plucked it out with its beak as it stood in the shallow edge of the Atlantic on Cape Cod.
