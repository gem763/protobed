Derby\n\nBoston Fed leader Eric Rosengren said Tuesday the U.S. economy still seems in a good enough place to avoid the need for rate cuts, in comments that shrugged off bond-market pricing levels that suggest a downturn is looming.\n\n\"This is a particularly good time to carefully watch incoming data -- to determine whether any additional policy adjustments are necessary to achieve the Fed's congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and stable prices,\" Mr. Rosengren said in the text of a speech to be delivered in Easton, Mass.\n\nGiven the current situation with global growth, \"it is clearly reasonable to make the assessment that risks are elevated,\" he said. \"Should those risks become a reality, the appropriate monetary policy would be to ease aggressively. However, to date, these elevated risks have not become reality, at least for the U.S. economy,\" Mr. Rosengren said.\n\nThe Boston Fed leader was one of two central bankers who voted against the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to lower short-term rates by a quarter percentage point at the end of July. Mr. Rosengren has for some time argued against lowering short-term borrowing costs in an economy that is generally doing pretty well.\n\nThe Fed is set to meet in the middle of this month and is very likely to lower rates again. In his speech Tuesday, Mr. Rosengren opened the door to supporting rate cuts if needed, while showing no sign he is ready to walk through it.\n\nIn his remarks, Mr. Rosengren said most economic risks lie outside the U.S. Growth levels remain good and unemployment is low, he said, while weak inflation is still likely to trend back up to the Fed's 2% target, he said.\n\nMr. Rosengren observed that some of the strongest pessimism over the outlook stems from financial markets, but even there, he said it wasn't a monolithic outlook. \"If one thought that the economy was going into an economic downturn, one would expect such concerns to be reflected in equity prices, as corporate earnings tend to decline significantly in a recession,\" Mr. Rosengren noted.\n\nThe central banker brushed off the bond market's so-called yield curve inversion. That is where the normally positive relationship between short- and long-dated bonds turns negative. Inversions have a very strong track record of preceding downturns, and some on the Fed, like St. Louis Fed leader James Bullard, are quite worried about where the market is.\n\nMr. Rosengren, while arguing for caution in making sense of the market, said the inversion was driven largely by what appears to be foreign buying and not central-bank policy actions.\n\n\"The depressed long-term yield, in part, reflects the challenging economic conditions in much of the rest of the world,\" he said.\n\nWrite to Michael S.
