Even the Democratic politicians and operatives who regularly complain to me about Perez have acknowledged that he is in a no-win situation. Staffers at the DNC headquarters know it, too: If the Democratic nominee beats Donald Trump, Perez will get none of the credit, and if the Democrat loses, he\u2019ll get more than his share of the blame. The most frequent criticism I hear about Perez is that by trying to stay \u201cneutral\u201d and not shape the nomination process, he has actually done a lot\u2014that in his mission to restore faith in a retrenched Democratic establishment, he\u2019s instead come off like the embodiment of the establishment\u2019s slow and awkward collapse.\n\nFor example, Perez\u2019s critics say that by refusing to change the established DNC rules and hold a climate-change debate, he is betraying the planet. (The counterargument: A concession might have opened the door to any number of topic-specific debates, and it\u2019s not clear that one debate on climate change would have significantly changed how the issue has been addressed in the race.) By not buying ads defending former Vice President Joe Biden from Trump\u2019s smears in the Ukraine scandal, some go as far to say, Perez has betrayed the party and the Constitution (though buying those ads would have opened the DNC up to accusations of favoring one candidate). But perhaps most of all, Perez\u2019s attackers say, by making primary-debate rules that rely on donor and polling thresholds, he\u2019s enabled outsider candidates to advance and prevented more experienced Democrats from gaining momentum.\n\nRead: The Democratic debates aren\u2019t pleasing anyone\n\nI asked Perez about this last claim, specifically: Has he made it so that the candidate who becomes the Democratic nominee is the one who spent months hoop-jumping to qualify for the debates? \u201cTom hasn\u2019t made sure,\u201d he said. \u201cThe voters have made sure.\u201d He went on: \u201cWhen you\u2019re at zero percent in the polling or 1 percent in a few polls, I don\u2019t see any historic precedent. We\u2019re three months and change out [from the Iowa caucuses]. I mean, nobody who was under 2 percent in the fall for the last 40 years won even a caucus. Nobody under 4 percent in December won anything.\u201d\n\nJeff Weaver, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont\u2019s top strategist, told me he sees DNC chair as \u201cmaybe one of the most difficult jobs in Washington,\u201d while making a point to say Perez has been working hard and doing it \u201ccapably.\u201d\n\nArguably, there has never been a time in modern politics when the DNC was more important. Even though some people have already dropped out, this is still the largest primary field in history (just like everyone else, Perez didn\u2019t expect quite this many people to run). And while Democrats are consumed with fighting for the nomination, with neither the time nor the money to start thinking as far ahead as next November, the Trump campaign is already raising and spending more than any presidential campaign to date.", "description": "The Democratic National Committee chairman needs to please the various factions of his party without catering to any of them.", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS1YI7K/facebook.jpg?1572040983", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
