Yovanovitch said Sullivan told her that Trump wanted her gone, even though she had \u201cdone nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much Sullivan will be willing to say on anything impeachment-related during his hearing; he may just defer to legal advisers given the political perils involved.\n\nAsked for comment, a State Department official said Sullivan \u201clooks forward\u201c to the hearing. \u201cWe hope for an expeditious confirmation so John Sullivan can quickly assume his duties and join the dedicated men and women on the frontlines of American diplomacy at Embassy Moscow,\u201c the official added.\n\nGenerally speaking, lawmakers from both parties hold Sullivan in good regard, and his nomination to serve as the U.S. ambassador in Moscow is likely to be approved in the coming weeks. He will succeed Jon Huntsman, the former Utah governor.\n\nRisch has wanted to hold hearings related to U.S.-Russia policy, and that could still happen. A Republican committee aide said the State Department has said it is willing to send another top Pompeo aide, David Hale, to appear for a Russia-related session.\n\nHale, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, is a career Foreign Service officer whose role in the Ukraine issue remains unclear. But given his top position, a hearing ostensibly about Russia policy is almost certain to touch on impeachment, too.\n\nAt his hearing Wednesday, Sullivan is likely to also face some questions about alleged political retaliation against career staffers at the State Department, Senate Democratic aides said.\n\nWhile Yovanovitch has become a prominent example of such alleged retaliation, her case is relatively new. Foreign and civil service employees at State have accused Trump political appointees of mistreating them dating back to the early days of the administration.\n\nSome believe Sullivan, himself a political appointee, hasn\u2019t done enough to protect career staffers, nor enough to punish perpetrators. But there\u2019s a recognition that Sullivan can only do so much, and he remains a more popular figure within the department than Pompeo.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/00/c2/cc2eb04742e5ba3d944377dfd4bc/191029-john-sullivan-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
