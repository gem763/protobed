The two men, Muhammad Kuchazi and Adamu Usman,\n\npleaded guilty to all the charges on behalf of the company.\n\nThe men, both Nigerians, were not personally charged and\n\nfreely left the court.\n\nIn a statement, P&ID said the EFCC investigation had not\n\nafforded basic human rights to those involved and called on the\n\ngovernment to \"accept its responsibilities under the law.\"\n\n\"None of the individuals involved are current employees or\n\nrepresentatives of P&ID,\" the spokesman said. \"P&ID itself has\n\nreceived no communication from any Nigerian authority about the\n\ninvestigation or today's hearing. There has been no evidence\n\nproduced, no defence allowed, no charges laid, no due process\n\nfollowed,\" it said.\n\nThe EFCC described Kuchazi as commercial director, and Usman\n\nas director of the company's local subsidiary.\n\nThe men could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nP&ID was set up to execute a 2010 deal with the Nigerian\n\ngovernment to build and operate a gas-processing plant in the\n\nsoutheastern port city of Calabar. When the deal collapsed, P&ID\n\ntook the government to arbitration, eventually winning a $6.6\n\nbillion award that has been accruing interest since 2013.\n\nLast month, a judge in London said he would grant P&ID the\n\nright to convert the award to a judgment, which would allow it\n\nto seek to seize assets from the Nigerian government to collect\n\nthe award. The government has said the deal was designed to fail, and\n\ncalled the award \"an assault on every Nigerian and unfair.\"\n\nNigeria's attorney general and justice minister, Abubakar\n\nMalami, said Thursday's ruling gave Nigeria \"a judicial proof of\n\nfraud and corruption\" in P&ID's founding.\n\n\"A liability that is rooted in fraud and corruption cannot\n\nstand judicial enforceability,\" he said. \"Nigeria now has a\n\ncogent ground for setting aside the liability.\"\n\nHe said officials would travel to London next week to\n\nprepare for a court date related to the case on Sept. 26.\n\nThe ruling in Abuja would not necessarily impact P&ID's\n\nefforts to seize assets. A Lagos court ordered in 2016 that the\n\nentire arbitration be set aside, but the arbitration tribunal\n\nrejected the court's jurisdiction to rule on the matter - a\n\ndecision affirmed by last month's London ruling.\n\n\n\nEXPLAINER-Nigerian assets at risk worldwide in $9 bln\n\narbitration case says it will not relinquish assets in $9 bln gas project\n\ndispute judge to allow firm to try to seize $9 bln in Nigerian assets\n\nin gas dispute ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 2-Nigerian court orders firm that won $9 bln case against government to forfeit assets", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_3_800x533_L_1412601605.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
