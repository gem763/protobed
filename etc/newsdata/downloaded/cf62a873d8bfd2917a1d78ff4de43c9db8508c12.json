Eight people died during the fight between Mexican authorities and cartel gunmen\n\nAuthorities admitted Friday that the troops let Ovidio go after eight of their own members were held hostage. The troops were also surrounded by enemies and there was no clear exit strategy for them.\n\n'Decisions were made that I support, that I endorse because the situation turned very bad and lots of citizens were at risk, lots of people and it was decided to protect the life of the people,' President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said in a news conference Friday.\n\n'You cannot value the life of a delinquent more than the lives of the people.'\n\nEl Chapo's lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, told the New York Post Friday that Ovidio's arrest warrant - which kicked off the day's raid and subsequent violence - originated from a federal judge in Washington, DC.\n\nLichtman said that Ovidio is 'safe and not in custody,' but noted that it was 'unclear what exactly happened,' but that they would look into it 'As soon as the smoke clears.'\n\nOvidio and brother Joaquin Guzman Lopez were indicted in 2018 in Washington, along with a fourth brother, on charges of trafficking cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana.\n\nThe indictment was unsealed on February 13 and covered the period from April 2008 to April 2018. At the time, the brothers' father, El Chapo, was running the Sinaloa cartel with Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada.\n\nEl Chapo was sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years by a Brooklyn federal judge in July, after being convicted of multiple charges, including drug trafficking, money laundering and murder conspiracy.\n\nThe cartel is now said to be run by El Chapo's two other sons, Ivan and Jesus Alfredo Guzman, alongside Zambada.\n\nThursday's gun battle was said to have paralyzed Culiacan, and left the streets littered with burning vehicles, which residents took cover indoors as automatic gunfire raged outside.\n\nMexican authorities said 35 troops arrived at a home Thursday afternoon to arrest Ovidio on a 2018 extradition request from the US, kicking off chaos and violence in Culiacan, Mexico\n\nVehicles were burned during the clash on Thursday, which also led to prisoners escaping\n\nTwo of the eight people who died during Thursday's violence are pictured in Culiacan\n\nA burned semi truck used by gunman could be seen smoldering at an intersection Friday\n\nAnother person is pictured here dead in the street in Culiacan following the violent struggle\n\nA police officer is shown here pouring water over the burning wreck of a truck on Friday\n\nOvidio is one of El Chapo's (pictured in 2014) sons. Ovidio and two brothers were indicted in 2018 in Washington, on charges of trafficking cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana\n\nIn addition to the 35 men who entered Ovidio's home, heavily-armed men in greater force surrounded the house and also unleashed mayhem elsewhere, taking over toll booths and main roads into the city. Men carrying high-caliber weapons blocked major intersections.\n\nAmid the chaos, inmates at a prison rioted, seized weapons from guards and fled. Fifty-six prisoners escaped, and 49 were still at large Friday, according to Sinaloa Public Security Secretary Crist\u00f3bal Casta\u00f1eda. Two guards were taken captive and later freed.\n\nThe attacks were so brazen that Sinaloa cartel gunmen took several soldiers hostage and even attacked the housing complex where soldiers' wives and children live.\n\nThe government's security cabinet made the decision to withdraw the troops to avoid greater loss of life.\n\n'The capture of one criminal cannot be worth more than the lives of people. They made the decision and I supported it,' L\u00f3pez Obrador said. He added: 'We do not want deaths. We do not want war.'\n\nSecurity cabinet officials said they were not informed about the operation beforehand. They said troops surrounded the house without a search warrant and came under fire before one could be delivered, at that point deciding to enter without the warrant. And they said the troops underestimated the cartel's response.\n\nSandoval said that if the security cabinet had known about the operation, it would have gone about it differently and deployed more troops and even sent air support.\n\n'This group ... rushed things. It did not consider the consequences,' he said.\n\nJuan Pablo Badillo, a lawyer who represents the drug lord in Mexico, praised L\u00f3pez Obrador, saying Ovidio Guzman was freed 'by a manly order, an intelligent order, a sensible order from President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador.'\n\nStreets in Culiacan, a city of over 800,000, remained blocked with torched cars Friday morning, schools were closed, and some public offices asked their employees to stay home.", "description": "New reports indicate El Chapo's son, Ovidio Guzman Lopez (pictured), was released from Mexican authority custody after his older brother orchestrated a violent response to the raid.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/01/19941388-0-image-a-6_1571530881719.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
