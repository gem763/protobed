(AP) - Luke Falk was merely a practice squad quarterback a week ago, a guy whose name with which some New York Jets fans might not even have been familiar.\n\nWell, they all know it now.\n\nWith Sam Darnold still sidelined by mononucleosis and Trevor Siemian out for the season with an ankle injury, Falk is the Jets\u2019 starting quarterback - and against the New England Patriots, of all opponents.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been a bit of a whirlwind, but it\u2019s starting to slow down,\u201d Falk said. \u201cI\u2019m excited for the opportunity. I just want to go out there and do my job and help my team win.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll also have to do it against his childhood idol, Tom Brady.\n\nAnd, get this: Brady, of course, was taken with the 199th overall pick in the 2000 NFL draft. Last year, Falk was drafted by Tennessee at, yep, you guessed it: No. 199 - a fact not lost on the youngster.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of weird,\u201d the 24-year-old Falk said with a smile. \u201cI got my phone and I saw the Titans were pick (No.) 199 and I got a call from Tennessee around 196 and I was like, \u2018No way,\u2019 so it was pretty cool. I was just happy I got drafted.\u201d\n\nHe was among the Titans\u2019 final camp cuts last year, and then claimed off waivers by Miami and then-coach Adam Gase. Falk was waived by the Dolphins in May, and Gase jumped at the chance to reunite with him in New York.\n\nNow, Falk will make his first NFL start against a team that has outscored opponents 76-3 in its first two games. He\u2019ll also try to help prevent the Jets from falling into an 0-3 hole before entering their bye-week break.\n\nNah, no pressure.\n\n\u201cYou have to realize it\u2019s just football,\u201d Falk said. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing this sport for a long time. Obviously, not at this level, but you have to keep simple things simple, go out and execute the game plan and put the ball in play.\n\n\u201cUltimately, you have to focus on the small things, not get too wrapped up in the whole big picture, I guess.\u201d\n\nThe Jets are massive underdogs against the Patriots, with the line growing to as many as 22\u00bd points in some books, but Gase has no concerns about Falk maintaining his cool, calm demeanor.\n\n\u201cTrust me, if you were around him, you wouldn\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Gase said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way he is. He\u2019s built that way.\u201d\n\nFalk is in this position because of a series of unexpected events over the past week. Darnold was diagnosed last week with mononucleosis, an illness that will keep him out for at least one more game. Siemian stepped in as the starter against Cleveland last Monday night, but was hurt in the second quarter.\n\nFalk stepped in - to chants of \u201cLuuuuke!\u201d at MetLife Stadium - and went 20 of 25 for 198 yards after replacing Siemian in the 23-3 loss. Only three of those passes went for 20 yards of more, including a 36-yarder to Robby Anderson, as Gase\u2019s offense went to a mostly short passing game. But Falk still became just the third NFL quarterback since the 1970 merger to post at least an 80% completion rate in his first game with at least 20 attempts, joining Jacksonville\u2019s Gardner Minshew (88.0%, 2019) and Philadelphia\u2019s Nate Sudfeld (82.6%, 2017).\n\n\u201cHe has really good command, he\u2019s an accurate passer, he knows how to get us in and out of the right plays,\u201d offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains said. \u201cHe did a nice job in the game.\u201d\n\nLoggains didn\u2019t anticipate using a reduced package of plays for Falk just because it\u2019s his first start.\n\n\u201cLuke had the advantage of sitting and watching a lot last year (in Miami) and going through another offseason of learning, and he\u2019s going to be a step ahead because he\u2019s been in the system longer than a lot of people on the roster right now,\u201d Loggains said. \u201cHe\u2019s been in it, he knows it.\u201d\n\nFalk is also no stranger to beating the odds.\n\nThe native of Logan, Utah, was a walk-on at Washington State, redshirted his freshman year, and went from the backup to sudden starter in 2014 when Connor Halliday was injured. Falk then became one of the most prolific passers in college football over the next three seasons, finishing as the Pac-12\u2019s career leader in touchdown passes, yards passing, completions, completion percentage and attempts.\n\nDespite the gaudy numbers and success in college, he lasted until the third day of the draft and was the ninth quarterback taken in that class.\n\nNone of that matters now, of course. Not with a big game coming up against an AFC East rival.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t lost a beat with him, and I think that\u2019s important,\u201d center Ryan Kalil said. \u201cYou saw how he finished out the game the other day. I think he gives us a good shot of making some explosive plays and putting us in the right situations. He\u2019s shown it all week, and we\u2019re excited to get out there with him and see what he can do.\u201d\n\nNOTES: LB Jordan Jenkins (calf) was listed as out, along with Darnold. \u2026 LB C.J. Mosley (groin), DL Quinnen Williams (ankle) and WR Demaryius Thomas (hamstring) are doubtful to play at New England. \u2026 LG Kelechi Osemele (knee), LT Kelvin Beachum, WR Josh Bellamy (shoulder), RG Brian Winters (shoulder), RB Trenton Cannon (ankle/hamstring), CB Brian Poole (groin), NT Steve McLendon (hip) and S Rontez Miles (hip) are all questionable.
