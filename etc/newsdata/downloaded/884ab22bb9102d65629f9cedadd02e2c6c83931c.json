(York Du/NTD)\n\nRobert Epstein: How Big Tech Bias Threatens Free and Fair Elections\n\nTech giants have \u201ca whole class of techniques\u201d exclusively at their disposal \u201cfor shifting people\u2019s opinions, thinking, attitudes, beliefs, purchases, and votes without people knowing, and without leaving a paper trail,\u201d Robert Epstein said in an interview with The Epoch Times for the \u201cAmerican Thought Leaders\u201d program.\n\nEpstein, a senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology and former editor-in-chief of Psychology Today, has devoted the past 6 1/2 years to researching tech giant bias, especially with Google, which dominates the search engine market.\n\n\u201cAmericans see Google search results about 500 million times a day. Google controls roughly 90 percent of search. The next largest search engine, Bing, controls about 2 percent of search,\u201d Epstein said.\n\nEpstein\u2019s peer-reviewed research found that research participants were remarkably susceptible to bias: search engine bias could easily shift 20 percent or more of the votes of undecided voters in an election. He also found that while results on Google leaned left substantially, results on Bing and Yahoo did not.\n\nOn Sept. 9, it was announced that 48 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have opened a bipartisan antitrust probe into Google. The new investigation follows existing investigations by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission into Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon.\n\nOne major form of bias that Epstein is research is the search engine manipulation effect, something he began exploring after finding research in 2012 on how search result rankings affected purchases and clicks. It said that users tended to trust the highest-ranked search results the most, so much so that 50 percent of clicks went to the top two items.\n\nTo study how search engine rankings could shift voting preferences, he conducted a series of experiments in which he showed groups of randomly assigned people biased search results. They used a Google-like search engine, Kadoodle, that featured real search results and web pages taken from Google. The only difference was the ranking of the results.\n\nOne group was shown results biased to one candidate, one saw results biased to the other candidate, and the control group was shown mixed results, with bias in both directions. Before and after looking at the search results, participants were asked about their thoughts on the candidates, and who they\u2019d vote for if they had to decide at that moment.\n\n\u201cI thought I could produce a shift in voting preferences and opinions of maybe 2 or 3 percent,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cThe first experiment I ran, the shift I got was 48 percent.\u201d\n\nEpstein conducted more than a dozen different experiments, in which he found substantial shifts every time. In one large-scale national study across all 50 states with more than 2,000 participants, Epstein found that among different demographic groups, some were especially susceptible to manipulation, with shifts in preferences as high as 80 percent.\n\nThese shifts are reflective of actual behavior in the ballot box, Epstein said. Survey research has shown that \u201cif you ask people who they\u2019re going to vote for, it turns out that\u2019s a very good predictor of who they actually vote for,\u201d he said. \u201cGenerally speaking, we\u2019re talking about 90, 95 percent accuracy in predictions.\u201d\n\nAnd according to Epstein, what they found in their experiments likely underestimated the real impact that Google has since most of his experiments had participants conducting only one online search.\n\n\u201cIn real life, people are conducting many searches over a period of weeks or months that are election-related. If they\u2019re undecided, that means they\u2019re being hit over and over and over again with biased search results, taking them to web pages that favor one candidate,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, Epstein has identified 12 major techniques of tech giants that can shift perceptions and opinions.\n\nAnother easy way to influence voters is by targeted messaging, such as sending out \u201cgo vote\u201d reminders only to people with certain political biases. Based on Epstein\u2019s calculations using Facebook\u2019s published data in 2012, Hillary Clinton would have received 450,000 more votes on election day in 2016 if Facebook had sent a \u201cgo vote\u201d reminder just to left-leaning users.\n\nAnd notably, Google, even if it sent a reminder to everyone, both liberal and conservative\u2014as it did by changing its homepage logo in 2018\u2014that would give Democrats upwards of 800,000 more votes than it would have given Republicans, simply because Google has more left-leaning than right-leaning users, according to Epstein.\n\nNo Paper Trail\n\nIn early 2018, a leak to The Wall Street Journal included one email from a Google employee that mentioned using \u201cephemeral experiences\u201d to counter Trump\u2019s immigration policy.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s an ephemeral experience? That means you type in something, let\u2019s say a search term. And some results are generated on the fly just for you. They impact you, they disappear; they\u2019re gone. And they\u2019re not stored anywhere. And you can\u2019t go back in time and find them,\u201d Epstein said.\n\n\u201cThis is a fantastic way to manipulate people,\u201d because it leaves no paper trail to follow, and people rarely spot the bias, he said.\n\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s something creepy. The very, very small number of people who can spot the bias, they shift even farther in the direction of the bias.\n\n\u201cMost of these types of influence have never existed before in human history. They\u2019re made possible by the Internet. They\u2019re made possible by these huge tech monopolies, and they\u2019re entirely in the hands of these tech monopolies.\n\n\u201cIn elections, we\u2019re influenced by billboards, by radio shows, and TV shows, and advertisements, and so on. All of that is competitive. And in that sense, it\u2019s probably a good thing. It\u2019s a good thing for democracy that there is so much competition out there vying for your attention and trying to convince you of this or that. But if there\u2019s bias in search results, that\u2019s controlled by the platform, in this case, Google. That\u2019s not competitive.\u201d\n\nEven if you found and could measure such bias, \u201cyou cannot counteract it,\u201d he said.\n\n2016 Election\n\nIn 2016, Epstein set up a secret monitoring system that showed that Google results were significantly skewed toward Clinton in the months leading up to the presidential election.\n\nEpstein had 95 field agents in 24 states conduct election-related searches with neutral search terms on Google, Bing, and Yahoo. The results from all these searches were then saved.\n\n\u201cWe were able to preserve 13,207 election-related searches as well as the 98,044 webpages to which the search results linked,\u201d Epstein said. In effect, they were able to permanently preserve snapshots of what are normally \u201cephemeral\u201d experiences.\n\nEpstein decided only to collect the data, but not to analyze it prior to the 2016 election, because if he found bias, he would face an impossible dilemma.\n\n\u201cWhat would I do? I mean, if I announced it, there would have been absolute chaos, especially, I think, if there was bias against Donald Trump. And if I didn\u2019t announce it, then I would be complicit in the rigging of an election,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the analysis, \u201cwe found substantial bias favoring Hillary Clinton in all 10 search positions on the first page of search results on Google, but not Bing or Yahoo,\u201d he said, adding that the probability that the bias was solely due to chance was less than 1 in 1000.\n\nThrough a series of calculations, Epstein concluded that if this level of bias was present nationwide, it would\u2019ve shifted somewhere between 2.6 million and 10.4 million votes to Clinton.\n\nEpstein describes himself as a moderate who leans liberal. And he had been a longtime supporter of the Clintons. \u201cBut I felt very strongly that since our results were so clear that I had a responsibility to report the findings,\u201d he said.\n\nClinton won the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes, but the popular vote \u201cmight have been very different,\u201d Epstein said, if there had been no bias in Google\u2019s search results.\n\n\u201cIt was uncomfortable for me to have to acknowledge that, to have to announce that. But that\u2019s what I concluded from the research.\u201d\n\nPeople trust in Google\u2019s search rankings, he said, because they believe it\u2019s generated by a computer algorithm, and thus must be impartial. What was especially disturbing was the subliminal manipulation; in most cases, \u201cpeople can\u2019t see the bias in search results.\u201d\n\nFor the 2018 midterm elections, Epstein set up a larger monitoring system focusing on three Republican districts in Orange County, California, which all ended up flipping Democrat. He found that on Google (but not Bing or Yahoo), search results were strongly biased in favor of Democratic candidates.\n\nBased on Epstein\u2019s calculations, if that same level of bias was present nationwide in 2018, it would have shifted more than 78.2 million votes across the different elections at the state, regional, and local levels\n\nIs Tech Giant Bias Intentional?\n\nGoogle has insisted that their algorithms for search ranking evolve according to the \u201corganic\u201d activity of users interacting with the algorithm.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, that\u2019s complete nonsense. I\u2019ve been a programmer since I was a teenager,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cThe fact is, Google has total control over what happens.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say there are a lot of users who lean left or who lean right, the algorithm can respond any way it\u2019s programmed to respond. So I simply don\u2019t buy the idea that this was just the algorithm\u2019s fault or just the user\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\nAlthough he believes Google has total control of its search ranking, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Google engineers deliberately designed their algorithms to have left-leaning biases.\n\n\u201cI admit I used to be obsessed with wanting to know whether executives at a company like Google or just rogue employees were fiddling around with search results and search suggestions,\u201d he said.\n\nBut now Epstein doesn\u2019t think it matters. Regardless of whether people working at the tech giants have intentionally skewed the results, or if they\u2019ve simply been negligent about political bias, the reality is that they have an enormous impact on thinking, behavior, and votes even in distant corners of the world, he said.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say in many countries, they don\u2019t care. For many elections, let\u2019s say they don\u2019t care, but the algorithm is still going to do its thing,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir algorithm is meant to tell you what\u2019s best, and what\u2019s best goes at the top.\n\n\u201cSo what I realized was it\u2019s very possible that a lot of important events right now in human history are being determined not by plans and goals and strategies of human beings at a company like Google, but by computer programs that are just being left to do their own thing. To me, that\u2019s far more frightening than thinking that a Google executive is out to rule the world.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, we have let loose upon humanity powerful computer algorithms, which are impacting humanity.\n\nCombating Bias in 2020\n\nFor the 2020 elections, Epstein plans to launch a much more ambitious monitoring system to track tech-giant bias.\n\n\u201cI think that the tech companies are going to go all out\u201d in 2020, he said. \u201cI think they were very cautious and overconfident in 2016. I think there\u2019s a lot of crazy things they could have done to shift votes that they just didn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nAs the 2020 election nears, Epstein plans to set up at least 1,000 field agents in all 50 states. \u201cAnd we\u2019re planning this time to use artificial intelligence\u2014we\u2019ve been working on this in recent months\u2014to analyze the massive amount of data that we\u2019re receiving every day in real time. This means that if we find evidence of bias or some sort of manipulation, we\u2019ll announce it. We\u2019ll announce it as soon as we\u2019re sure that we found it \u2026 either to the media or to the Federal Election Commission or to other authorities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd that is going to create a kind of chaos. But it\u2019s the kind of chaos we need to have.\u201d\n\nHe hopes that this monitoring project will encourage tech giants to stop political bias on their platforms.\n\nOn the other hand, he said, \u201cif they don\u2019t back down, and we continue to detect and capture evidence of large-scale vote manipulation, I think frankly these companies will pay a terrible price. I think there could be both civil actions taken against them and possibly criminal actions taken against them.\u201d\n\nEither way, Epstein said, \u201cdemocracy wins. And that\u2019s my concern here. I\u2019m not concerned about any particular party or candidate, although I do lean left. I\u2019m concerned about democracy and free and fair elections.\u201d\n\nHe believes that Google could easily remove political bias in its search results using techniques it\u2019s already developed to deal with what they describe as \u201calgorithmic unfairness.\u201d\n\nSuch techniques were thrust into the spotlight by the massive trove of documents recently leaked by former senior Google software engineer Zachary Vorhies. A simple example is the search term \u201cAmerican inventors.\u201d Whereas the original results might have shown a majority of white males, more black Americans can be boosted to the top of search results to make the results more \u201cfair.\u201d\n\nIf machine learning fairness techniques can correct for what Google engineers see as racial unfairness, the same could easily be done for political bias, in Epstein\u2019s view.\n\n\u201cAnd I think we have to think beyond the United States because a company like Google is impacting more than 2 billion people around the world. Within three years, that number will swell to over 4 billion people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey can literally impact thinking behavior, attitudes, beliefs, elections in almost every country in the world.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, that means building larger, better-monitoring systems to keep an eye on companies like Google. I think that\u2019s necessary, not only to protect democracy around the world but to protect human autonomy.\u201d\n\nCorrection: The previous version of this article incorrectly identified the percentage of votes that can be shifted based on Epstein\u2019s peer-reviewed research. According to his research, search engine bias could shift 20 percent or more votes of undecided voters in an election.
