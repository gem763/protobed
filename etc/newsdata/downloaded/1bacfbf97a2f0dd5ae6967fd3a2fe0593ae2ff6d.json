Osaka said.\n\n'I feel like I wasn't that calm here (at the tournament). I threw my racket, like, once every match. I really wanted to win here, I felt like I had something to prove.'\n\nThe Japanese turned the tables in the second set when she broke back to take a 4-2 lead. At 30-all, she unleashed a backhand return to bring up a fourth break point and then forced Barty to hit her forehand long.\n\nOsaka did not concede a single break point in the second set and took it into the decider after closing out on her serve.\n\nShe then upped the tempo right from the opening game of the third set with long baseline rallies which forced Barty into making mistakes, earning the fourth seed a break of serve.\n\nBarty took an early set lead but was overcome by the power of Osaka on court\n\nA poor service game from Barty when she was down 4-2 in the third saw her broken to love as Osaka won eight points in a row to take a 5-2 lead and serve for the title.\n\nBarty managed to save one match point in the final game but Osaka took to the baseline again to out-rally her opponent, wrapping up the encounter and levelling their head-to-head record at 2-2.", "description": "Japan's Naomi Osaka fought back from a set down to beat Australian world number one Ash Barty 3-6 6-3 6-2 in the final of the China Open in Beijing on Sunday.", "authors": ["Rohith Nair"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/13/19360438-0-image-a-64_1570365150814.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
