The case they put forward is entirely based on inference.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIf they are successful, the so-called \u201cforfeiture rule\u201d, designed to stop killers getting victims\u2019 cash, means she cannot inherit. She will be entitled to the money if she wins.\n\nThe judge said one of the \u201ccentral issues\u201d in the Family\u2019s claim that Ms Ziuzina gave an \u201cuntrue and false\u201d account of her movements in the hours after the death.\n\nRather than returning to the couple\u2019s flat in Kiev as she claimed, they allege she travelled to the town of Shpitki \u201cin the aftermath of the incident in order to meet the driver\u201d of the vehicle that killed Mr Pring.\n\nChief Master Marsh referred to a \u201csurprisingly forthright\u201d letter sent by the General Prosecutor of Ukraine in 2012, stating that \u201cMs Moore had given false testimony in the pre-trial investigation\u201d.\n\nThe prosecutor wrote: \u201cImmediately after the crime, Ganna announced that she felt bad and about 2.00 of February 17, 2008 went home, but during the time period from 3.00 to 5.00 of February 17, 2008 she was visiting Shpitki Village for unknown reasons.\u201d\n\n(Image: SWNS.com)\n\nIn her defence, Ms Ziuzina denies going to the village in the aftermath.\n\nThe family further claim in the court papers that at the time of his death Mr Pring was \u201cintoxicated and disorientated\u201d after drinking during a meal at the Kozachok restaurant, close to the four lane M06 motorway.\n\nMs Ziuzina pretended to call a taxi and claimed it would take 30 to 40 minutes to arrive, the papers allege.\n\nThe claim adds: \u201cThe conversation which she reported to the deceased was a charade, designed to induce the deceased to find some other means of returning to Kiev other than by taxi ordered by telephone.\u201d\n\nThe couple then left the restaurant and Mr Pring crossed a crash barrier where he was hit by a car travelling at over 55mph, it is claimed.\n\nThe papers say: \u201cThere was no good reason for the motor car to be travelling along the hard shoulder...The brakes of the motor car were not applied during the incident; it did not crash, brake of stop subsequently. It is to be inferred that the motor vehicle was deliberately driven along the hard shoulder at speed, and was deliberately driven at the deceased.\u201d\n\n(Image: SOLO Syndication)\n\n\n\nThe car was a Volkswagen Jetta posing as a taxi that had been stolen from a spot in Kiev close to an apartment that had been rented by the model, it is alleged.\n\nThe papers state: \u201cIt is to be inferred that the person driving the car knew that the deceased would be seeking to flag down a taxi.\u201d\n\nIn her defence Ms Ziuzina denies the claims. She said the couple shared around 20 shots of vodka totalling around a litre.\n\nMr Pring began feeling sick and wanted to get home quickly using a \u201cgypsy cab\u201d or private vehicle acting as an informal taxi. He was hit as he attempted to catch a lift, she said.\n\nChildless Mr Pring, from Devon, died without leaving a will, meaning his British assets would normally pass to his widow.\n\nMs Ziuzina now lives in Marbella with Briton, Ivan Lister, 48.\n\nMr Pring\u2019s death was first recorded as a road traffic offence by the Ukrainian police but was later classified as premeditated murder.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Ganna Ziuzina - now known as Julianne Moore - is set to appear at a civil trial next month where the family of Barry Pring, 47, will accuse her of being behind his death - she denies it all", "authors": ["Tom Pettifor", "Image", "Swns.Com", "Collect Unknown", "Pa", "Solo Syndication"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20668268.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_article-2004869-0C8FD64C00000578-819_468x678.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
