REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) opposed in May a combination of TPG Telecom Ltd and the local joint venture of Britain\u2019s Vodafone Group PLC on the grounds it would eliminate a potential fourth mobile network competitor.\n\nA coming together of the companies would actually encourage competition but \u201cthe pro-competitive effects of this merger are imperiled by the ACCC\u2019s opposition to it\u201d, Vodafone lawyer Peter Brereton said.\n\nThe commission\u2019s main argument is that consumers will benefit more if TPG builds a fourth mobile network than if it merged with Vodafone Hutchison Australia, but TPG argues it has abandoned plans to build a new network.\n\nVodafone runs a mobile phone network with Hutchison Telecommunications (Australia) Ltd.\n\nTPG had planned to build a 4G mobile network to rival Vodafone\u2019s but scrapped it last year due to economic and technical factors and a government ban on gear supplied by its preferred vendor, China\u2019s Huawei Technologies.\n\nTPG\u2019s barrister Ruth Higgins told the Federal Court competition conditions have \u201cchanged materially\u201d since TPG began a plan to roll out a mobile network in mid-2016, and \u201cthat opportunity has been lost\u201d.\n\nWithout Huawei equipment, TPG could no longer justify spending shareholders\u2019 funds on a new network, in the face of rivals\u2019 5G high speed networks, falling revenue per user and rising investment costs to deliver more data, Higgins said.\n\nThe ACCC\u2019s lawyer Michael Hodge said the regulator believed TPG could take on the country\u2019s largest telcos, Telstra Corp and Singapore Telecommunications\u2019 Optus, even without the Huawei parts.\n\n\u201cThe prospect of snuffing out the only potential new entrant to the mobile market in Australia is a significant blow to competition,\u201d Hodge told the court.\n\nThe ACCC also questioned how strong a competitor the merged group would be to the top telcos within the next three years and challenged the claim TPG could not build its network without the Huawei equipment.\n\nThe hearing continues for the next several weeks, with company executives and industry experts due to testify.", "description": "Australia's antitrust regulator has hurt competition by blocking a A$15 billion ($10 billion) merger between the nation's third- and fourth-largest telecoms providers, the companies said in court on Tuesday as their legal appeal got underway.", "authors": ["Sonali Paul", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428148545&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8902U", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
