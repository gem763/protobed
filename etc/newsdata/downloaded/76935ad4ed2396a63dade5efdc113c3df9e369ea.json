However, all is not clear. Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party does not support the deal. The opposition Labour Party is calling for the agreement to be rejected. As of this writing, there is no guarantee that the deal will be approved by the U.K. Parliament.\n\nInvestors ought to know the most important thing about Brexit.\n\nTo find out, please click here for an annotated chart of S&P 500 ETF SPY, +0.29%.\n\nNote the following:\n\n\u2022 The chart shows the trend line for the U.S. stock market.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows the Arora call that Brexit might happen. This call came at a time when Wall Street consensus was that Brexit would not happen.\n\n\u2022 Wall Street was proven wrong when U.K. residents voted for Brexit.\n\n\u2022 Wall Street\u2019s call was that stocks would fall. The Arora Report\u2019s call was that stocks would rise and the dip was a buying opportunity.\n\n\u2022 The European Union is the largest trading partner for the U.K. In 2017, 53% of all U.K. imports were from the EU and 44% of all U.K. exports went to the EU.\n\n\u2022 The U.K. is a big trading nation. But investors ought to have the perspective that the U.K. is no longer the giant it once was in terms of its economic impact on the world. The United States\u2019 gross domestic product (GDP) is about $21 trillion, China\u2019s GDP is about $15 trillion and the U.K.\u2019s is about $3 trillion. Still, London is the center of international banking.\n\nAsk Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question?

The stock market did not fall below the trend line when Brexit was first announced. During all the wrangling over the years, the stock market did not fall due to Brexit issues. Now, isn\u2019t it unreasonable to assume that the stock market would rise because of the Brexit deal?\n\nThe Brexit deal is positive and certainly creates positive sentiment. However, in the end, it is not material for most investors.\n\nThere may be certain isolated opportunities in U.K. stocks and our plan is to take advantage of such opportunities.\n\nInstead of Brexit, investors ought to focus on price action in Netflix NFLX, +2.47% after the company reported third-quarter earnings. Overall, Netflix earnings are showing cracks. If the same earnings were reported almost any other time in the past, Netflix\u2019s stock would have fallen. As of this writing, Netflix\u2019s stock has jumped because earnings and subscriber numbers were better than the worst fears. Please see \u201cMomentum investors are now buying shares of Apple, Amazon and Netflix.\u201d\n\nThe smart money (professional investors) is not buying into the Netflix stock bounce so far. It is the momo (momentum) crowd and a short-squeeze causing the buying in Netflix stock.\n\nInvestors should also keep their eyes on the price action in mega-cap stocks such as Apple AAPL, +0.39%, Amazon AMZN, +0.57%, Facebook FB, +0.44% and Alphabet GOOG, +0.76% GOOGL, +0.79%.\n\nSemiconductor stocks are often an early indicator in a change in direction for the stock market. Popular semiconductor stocks such as Intel INTC, -1.12%, AMD AMD, +1.07%, Micron Technology MU, +0.75% and Nvidia NVDA, +0.04% are showing resilience.\n\nDisclosure: Subscribers to The Arora Report may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time.
