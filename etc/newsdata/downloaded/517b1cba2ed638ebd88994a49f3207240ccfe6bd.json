Plenty of those reports have excluded one not insignificant detail; that the manager of the club back then was Alex Ferguson.\n\nPaul Pogba and David de Gea to miss Manchester United v Liverpool Read more\n\nIt is easy to forget how truly abysmal Ferguson\u2019s United were between 1988 and 1990. They made the current lot look like freewheeling entertainers by comparison. In April 1989, United scored one goal in five games \u2013 and that was an own goal by Tony Adams, all his own work.\n\nThe subsequent success of Ferguson should logically carry the power of a judicial precedent. But giving managers time is an endangered concept, and there is a good chance that Manchester United\u2019s endless transition will continue with a fourth change of manager in six years.\n\nThere are understandable concerns that the scale of the job is too great for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. But no one really knows; not Solskj\u00e6r himself, certainly not Twitter\u2019s finest. And the rush to print another P45 wilfully ignores both mitigating circumstances for their recent form and the good work that Solskj\u00e6r has done since taking over.\n\nSolskj\u00e6r is the first manager since Ferguson who has attempted to rebuild rather than live hand to mouth and game to game. United have been decaying since the Glazers pillaged them in 2005. Ferguson\u2019s genius masked that for a time, but now United are back where he found them, in urgent need of change from top to bottom.\n\nSolskj\u00e6r inherited an inadequate, poisonous mess of a squad and now he has a major injury crisis as well\n\nOf the four managers at Old Trafford since Ferguson, Solskj\u00e6r has been easily the best in the transfer market. His signings so far are both instant hits and part of a long-term plan. His predecessors bought all kinds of wrong, in terms of ability, character or both, and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in particular has some front playing the mistreated sage given all he had to show for spending \u00a3350m.\n\nSolskj\u00e6r has been widely criticised for not replacing Romelu Lukaku, but he recognised that teams with Lukaku in them don\u2019t win trophies. Solskj\u00e6r wanted more from a No 9, and effectively replaced Lukaku with Anthony Martial (who in turn was replaced by Daniel James). That decision looked inspired in the first few games, with Martial sharper than at any stage since his first season at the club. Then he injured a thigh against Crystal Palace.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anthony Martial, celebrating here after scoring against Wolves, is one of many Manchester United players to have been injured this season.

United may be 12th in the league but they are flying high in one table; only Norwich City have more players out through injury. Solskj\u00e6r inherited an inadequate, poisonous mess of a squad, put together by four managers, and now he has a major injury crisis as well. In any sane culture these are mitigating circumstances.\n\nThose who aren\u2019t injured are painfully low on confidence; and, unlike his predecessors, Solskj\u00e6r does not have a peak David de Gea turning defeats into draws and draws into wins. Good luck to anyone in those circumstances. Pep Guardiola could defect to Old Trafford tomorrow, citing a long-standing ambition to work with Phil Jones, and it would make no difference in the short term. There is no quick fix at United. The mess is too great. They hired the king of instant success in Mourinho and even that didn\u2019t really work out. United have a simple choice between potential long-term success under Solskj\u00e6r and guaranteed long\u2011term failure under a load of different managers.\n\nIt would be unfair to say there is an anti-Solskj\u00e6r agenda in the media but there is certainly an anti-Solskj\u00e6r mood\n\nThis should be an exciting time for United supporters, a chance to potentially experience a modern equivalent of the magical rebirth under Tommy Docherty. And any success under Solskj\u00e6r would be worth far more than under somebody such as Mourinho or David Moyes.\n\nThere is no point denying that United\u2019s attacking play in recent matches has been dreadful. The team look like they have forgotten how to shoot, never mind score, and it\u2019s hard to reconcile some of Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s recent decisions and demeanour with the shiny, happy manager who took over at the end of last year. But the fact he won 14 of his first 17 games counts for something.\n\nUnder Solskj\u00e6r, United have been both thrilling and boring; aggressive and passive; tactically smart and tactically rigid. It\u2019s unusual and confusing, but until we see more \u2013 a lot more \u2013 we can\u2019t know which is representative. Given the scale of the job, and especially his status at United, he deserves time to come to terms with it. Even Ferguson \u2013 Sir Alex Bloody Ferguson, the greatest manager in history \u2013 looked out of his depth for a few years. Solskj\u00e6r also deserves far more respect, particularly from United fans. (On this subject, I speak with the evangelical zeal of the reformed moron.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is operating amid \u2018a culture of instant gratification, unrealistic expectations and brattish demands\u2019. Photograph: Nigel French/PA\n\nIt would be unfair to say there is an anti-Solskj\u00e6r agenda in the media, both traditional and social, not least because that would give far too much credit to a scattergun process. But there is certainly an anti-Solskj\u00e6r mood. There are probably a few reasons for this \u2013 the reliability of a United bad-news story, residual hatred from the Ferguson years and a frankly pathetic snobbery about Scandinavian football. Most of all, there is a culture of instant gratification, unrealistic expectations and brattish demands that has made football management harder than ever.\n\nThat mood has, probably unconsciously, contributed to a certain economy with the truth in the reporting of United this season. There has been little talk of their injuries and markedly improved defence, and hardly any of the fact they were robbed by VAR against Crystal Palace and Arsenal. Even our new friend Expected Goals, who normally has plenty to say, has gone quiet.\n\nAt the end of last season there were plenty of self-satisfied observations that Solskj\u00e6r should not have been given the job permanently because his xG wasn\u2019t very good even when he was winning twice a week. Few have commented on United\u2019s xG this season, which has them third in every table we could find on the internet. Even those of us who don\u2019t really care for xG would accept that, if the prosecution is able to use it as evidence, then the defence should be allowed to as well.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nSolskj\u00e6r is second on the expected sackings list, behind Everton\u2019s Marco Silva. There isn\u2019t just a sacking culture in football; in the media, certainly, it\u2019s a sacking cult. Every time a manager is under pressure we get the same rituals; the same bloodlust; the same grave expression on newsreaders\u2019 faces as we are solemnly informed that so-and-so\u2019s weekly press conference is scheduled for 10am.\n\nThere is no greater indictment of football\u2019s descent into reality TV than the infantile nonsense that has made it normal, almost compulsory, to get rid of a manager at the first sign of trouble. That big old mess in the White House; he\u2019d have sacked Solskj\u00e6r already. There has to be a moral in that.", "description": "The choice is simple: potential long-term success under Solskj\u00e6r or guaranteed long-term failure under a load of different managers", "authors": ["Rob Smyth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b8041b9692d50e49b3e1ef84105bc0a6a827944/188_95_2299_1379/master/2299.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0ba93ffeeeb24b64315388a74686bc03", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
