As always, with the Clintons, the tell for when they are lying is when they say \u201ctruth\u201d or \u201cfact.\u201d\n\nThen along comes President Trump, for whom all the laws of politics seem to be suspended.\n\nAt a rollicking campaign rally in North Carolina on Monday, Mr. Trump decided to talk some football. Not an altogether bad choice in the land of the Carolina Panthers.\n\n\u201cTom Brady had a pretty good game the other night, right?\u201d he said somewhat tentatively, referring to the New England Patriots\u2019 longtime star quarterback and the savage 33-3 beat down he delivered to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nSurprisingly, a number of Trump supporters cheered, though some in the audience gamely booed.\n\nUnfazed, Mr. Trump continued to prod and needle the crowd.\n\n\u201cHow good a coach \u2014 whether you like it or not, and I know you\u2019re North Carolina \u2014 but how good a coach, in all fairness, right, is Coach Belichick?\u201d\n\nThe crowd\u2019s cheers dimmed, perhaps growing tired of the president\u2019s taunting game. After all, the Patriots have won six Super Bowls. The Carolina Panthers haven\u2019t won their first.\n\n\u201cI know you want to be cool,\u201d Mr. Trump told his hushing fans. \u201cBut he\u2019s pretty good, right? We have to appreciate genius. We all like genius.\u201d\n\nAnd then he dropped it.\n\nWithin a minute, Mr. Trump was back to talking about guns and God and glory and the raucous crowd was back to swinging from the rafters and hooting their lungs out for their \u201cfavorite president.\u201d\n\nThat scene perfectly sums up the difference between Mr. Trump and all the fakers and frauds who came before him. Mr. Kerry\u2019s \u201cLambert\u201d Field flub and Mr. Romney\u2019s NASCAR car wreck revealed what monumental fakers both men are.\n\nLike many politicians, they were trying to be something they were not \u2014 and completely exposed themselves.\n\nMr. Trump never tries to be something he is not. He is always focused on selling himself as the consistent same product wherever he is. The conversations he has with people in private are pretty much the exact same conversations he has with people in public.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s naked pandering between Chicago and New York reveals what political whores the Clintons have always been. They can be trusted by absolutely no one.\n\nMr. Trump, on the other hand, cherishes the opportunity to speak the hard truth, even when people don\u2019t want to hear it. It\u2019s why so many people cringe over his \u201cimpolitic\u201d comments.\n\nThe reason Mr. Trump\u2019s North Carolina supporters did not cheer Bill Belichick\u2019s name is not because they think he is a terrible coach. They didn\u2019t cheer his name because they know President Trump was telling them the hard truth about how good a coach he really is.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s purposeful foray into the politics of football may have cost him some momentary cheers there in North Carolina. But it reminded everyone how much he loves to win and what a \u201cstable genius\u201d he is.\n\n\u2022 Contact Charles Hurt at [email protected] or on Twitter @charleshurt.\n\nSign up for Charles Hurt's Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
