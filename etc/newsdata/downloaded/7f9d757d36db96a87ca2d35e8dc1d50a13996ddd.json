Slowly roasting an already fatty fish in a generous amount of luxurious fat (here, one and a half cups of olive oil) makes it nearly impossible to overcook. Plus, you can flavor that oil with whatever you fancy \u2014 spices, herbs, citrus, chiles \u2014 which, in turn, will flavor the fish. It's a very simple method for cooking any large piece of fish (cod or halibut work well here, too). This makes it the ideal dinner party trick, sitting perfectly in the center of a Venn diagram where \u201clooks impressive\u201d and \u201cnot a ton of work\u201d overlap. It also doubles beautifully. Store any leftover salmon in the remaining oil, which will keep it from drying out, and use it to elevate a salad or a bagel with cream cheese.
