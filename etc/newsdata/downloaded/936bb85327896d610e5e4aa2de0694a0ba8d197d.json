Pack got his first for the club, and his first in 11 months, at the end of the opening half, while skipper Sean Morrison headed home the opener to get his account for the season up and running.\n\nWarnock brought Pack in from Bristol City just ahead of the closure date in the transfer window and was delighted to get him for around \u00a34 million.\n\n\u201cMarlon makes a difference to us because we miss Aron Gunnarsson. He doesn\u2019t ever panic, covers a lot of ground and he makes us play - I told him the other day he reminds me of Dave Mackay,\u201d said an admiring Warnock.\n\n\u201cIt was an organised and disciplined performance against a side that could have gone top of the league if they\u2019d won last weekend. We are getting better, but we can still go quite a way yet.\u201d\n\nAs for Warnock's opposite number, Mark Warburton, he was disappointed and frustrated to see his side lose back-to-back games following their loss to West Brom last weekend.\n\n\u201cIt was very frustrating. It felt like a smash and grab if I\u2019m honest,\u201d said Warburton.\n\n\u201cWe controlled the second half, we looked good, we hit the bar and had three big chances that we had to put in the back of the net. That\u2019s the harsh reality - if you don\u2019t do that you don\u2019t get the rewards.\u201d\n\nThe win for Cardiff took them up to 10th in the table, one place above QPR, and victory was sealed by Callum Paterson with a superb volley only a few minutes after coming on as a second half substitute.\n\nMatch details\n\nCardiff City (4-2-3-1): Smithies; Peltier, Morrison, Flint, Bennett; Pack, Bacuna; Whyte (Hoilett 87), Tomlin (Paterson 65), Murphy; Glatzel\n\nSubs Unused: Etheridge, Nelson, Mendez-Laing, Ward, Coxe\n\n\n\nQueens Park Rangers (4-2-3-1): Kelly; Rangel (Kane 68), Cameron, Leistner, Manning; Scowen, Ball (Wells 6); Chair (Pugh 80), Eze, Osayi-Samuel; Hugill\n\nSubs unused: Lumley, Wallace, Mlaker, Masterson\n\n\n\nReferee: Matt Donohue", "description": "Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock likened new signing Marlon Pack to the great Scottish midfield player\u00a0Dave Mackay as he sang his praises after watching him inspire the biggest win of the season for the Bluebirds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7T2i7D_6iyAk4rtNAVfMDQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pwoGflAEgHrxOtay4X9Z_A--~B/aD0xMjkwO3c9MjA2NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/42ab771dff9cb8998492906ec157cb91"}
