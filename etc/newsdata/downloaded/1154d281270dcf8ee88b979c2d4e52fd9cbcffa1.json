He will have two years of supervised release after he leaves prison.\n\nViner pleaded guilty in April to one count of conspiracy and one count of obstructing justice. He had originally pleaded not guilty but changed his plea in exchange for a lighter sentence. As part of his plea, Viner admitted trying to hide his involvement in the December 2017 episode when he realized the antic had gotten someone killed.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers in their plea agreement had recommended a sentence of two years of probation, with the added condition that Viner be confined for six months to his home unless attending school, work or church. They also jointly recommended the gaming restriction.\n\nEX-OHIO CHEERLEADER GETS PROBATION FOR ABUSE OF CORPSE AFTER MURDER ACQUITTAL\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Eric Melgren said a prison sentence was required to reflect the seriousness of the offense. It was foreseeable that something bad could happen by calling an armed police force to respond to what officers thought was an escalating situation of violence, he said.\n\n\"We impose sentences not only for what people intend, but what happened,\" Melgren said.\n\n\"Swatting, and soliciting others to swat someone, are more than foolish,\u201d U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister said in a statement. \u201cSuch actions are reckless, dangerous and, as this case proves, potentially tragic. Swatting is not a prank, and it is no way to resolve disputes among gamers. Once again, I call upon gamers to self-police their community to ensure that the practice of swatting is ended once and for all.\"\n\nSEATTLE-AREA COUNCIL MEMBER PROPOSES $1M BUSING PROGRAM FOR HOMELESS\n\nThe case originated with a $1.50 bet between Viner and \"Call of Duty: WWII\" opponent Shane Gaskill of Wichita, Kan. Gaskill refused to pay up, and police said Viner asked Tyler Barriss, 26, to \u201cswat\u201d Gaskill. Barriss called the police in Kansas from his home in Los Angeles to give a false report of a fake shooting and kidnapping at a Wichita address assumed to be Gaskill's.\n\nGaskill and his family previously lived at that address but were evicted in 2016. A SWAT team showed up at the house, which at this point belonged to 28-year-old Andrew Finch. The officers believed they were dealing with a man who had shot his own father and was holding family members hostage. An officer shot and killed Finch, and his family members have sued the Wichita police. Police said they believed Finch had been reaching for a gun as he lowered his hand near his waistband. The local district attorney declined to charge the officer.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGaskill has struck a deal for deferred prosecution that could allow the charges against him to be dropped. He was charged as a co-conspirator after knowingly giving Barriss the same former address and taunting him to \"try something.\"\n\nBarriss in April was sentenced to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to 51 felonies nationwide, one of the highest prison sentences ever imposed for \u201cswatting.\u201d", "description": "An Ohio gamer involved in a \u201cswatting\u201d incident which turned deadly was sentenced Friday to 15 years in prison, according to the US Justice Department.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/04/ContentBroker_contentid-d988305d44c24deeac34d248f58e18e3.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
