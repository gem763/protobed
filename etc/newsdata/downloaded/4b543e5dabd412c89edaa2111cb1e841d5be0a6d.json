But in 1998, he was violently killed at the hands of his wife.\n\n\u201cI think in my old age, I've come to realize just how precious everything is and I try to value the many blessings that have been bestowed upon me,\u201d Hartman reflected in a 1998 interview. \u201cBut there's also this sense of vulnerability if fortune took a turn for the worse, and that you live with the awareness that anything could happen in this world.\u201d\n\nWatch the full story on \"The Last Days of Phil Hartman\" THURSDAY, Sept. 19 at 9 p.m. ET on ABC\n\nHartman dabbled in a couple of other careers before finding comedy. He started out as a roadie for a band called Rockin\u2019 Foo, according to Mike Thomas, author of the biography \u201cYou Might Remember Me: The Life and Times of Phil Hartman.\u201d\n\nThomas said Hartman was living a \u201cbohemian existence\u201d where pot was plentiful. Around this time, he met Gretchen Lewis, who would go on to become his first wife.\n\nSteve Small, Hartman\u2019s close friend and lawyer, told \u201c20/20\u201d that \u201cPhil fell in love easily, but \u2026 wasn't very skilled at continuing a relationship.\u201d\n\nHartman married Lewis in 1970. By 1972, the two had divorced.\n\nBy the mid-70s, he was working for his brother\u2019s talent management agency. Using the graphic arts skills he honed in college, Hartman designed classic rock album covers, including the cover for America\u2019s \u201cHistory: America\u2019s Greatest Hits\u201d album and the simple line drawing of a horse on Poco\u2019s \u201cLegend\u201d album.\n\nBut it was his desire to branch out of his, as he called it, \u201cvery introverted lifestyle\u201d that would launch his comedy career. In 1975, he attended a show by the Los Angeles improv group The Groundlings, which invites audience members up to the stage. Hartman volunteered.\n\n\u201cI never saw an audience member come up with that kind of excitement and energy\u2026it was like a hurricane hit that stage, and I mean in a good way,\u201d said Tracy Newman, comedian and founding member of The Groundlings.\n\nRon Galella Collection via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe group thought he was so good that they invited him to join the troupe, while he also took classes there.\n\nIn 1982, Hartman married his second wife, Lisa Jarvis.\n\n\u201cMy sense of Phil was that he was really two people,\u201d Jarvis told \u201c20/20.\u201d \u201cHe was the guy who wanted to draw and write and think and create and come up with ideas. He was the actor [and] entertainer, and then he was the recluse.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeeing Phil at The Groundlings was Phil being truly Phil,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou know, as time goes by, you understand that his personas are his protection and [they] are his personality.\u201d\n\nBut after only a year of marriage, she said she realized the relationship was over.\n\n\u201cOn our first anniversary, we went back to Santa Barbara. And I dressed up... lingerie or something \u2026 and I jumped up on the bed\u2026 and he said, \u2018Must you? Really?\u2019 So I said, \u2018No.\u2019 I took it off, put a robe on, got my book out. And I knew that was the end.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after their divorce that Hartman met Brynn Omdahl.\n\nBorn Vicki Jo Omdahl, she grew up in northern Minnesota in a family of four children. Her brother, Greg Omdahl, said they had an \u201cidyllic childhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was always the instigator of fun,\u201d Greg Omdahl said.\n\nBrynn Omdahl moved to Los Angeles in her 20s with dreams of becoming a model and actress. She signed with a modeling agency, which helped her find work as a swimsuit model for Catalina swimwear. Meanwhile, she also went on auditions.\n\nThe LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images, FILE\n\n\u201cI remember she was gonna try out for \u2018Hee Haw,\u2019 to be one of the \u2018Hee Haw\u2019 girls that pops out of the corn stalks,\u201d Greg Omdahl said.\n\nDuring her time in L.A. in the 1980s, though, her brother said she developed an addiction to cocaine. \u201cShe had a problem with cocaine,\u201d he said. \u201cShe did too much cocaine.\u201d\n\nGreg Omdahl said he told her she needed to go to rehab. \u201cI talked her into going through treatment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs with Lisa, as with Gretchen, it becomes very intense very fast,\u201d Mike Thomas said about Hartman\u2019s relationship with Brynn Omdahl. \u201cBut as the months go on, the cracks begin to show and Phil does what he did with his last two relationships \u2014 he begins to withdraw emotionally. They begin this pattern of fighting and making up and fighting and making up that would mark their relationship from there on out.\u201d\n\nHartman\u2019s career takes off\n\nHartman spent 11 years at The Groundlings while getting more work. That included the role of \u201cCaptain Carl\u201d on the \u201cThe Pee Wee Herman Show\u201d, where he co-starred with fellow Groundling Paul Reubens.\n\nHis big break would come in the fall of 1986 when Hartman joined the cast of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d as a writer and performer.\n\nHartman joined a cast that included Jon Lovitz, Dana Carvey and Kevin Nealon. During his time on the show, Hartman played a wide range of characters, including Johnny Cash, Frank Sinatra, televangelist Jim Bakker, Ed McMahon, former President Ronald Reagan and even Jesus. But his most memorable role was his impression of Bill Clinton.\n\nR.M. Lewis Jr./NBC via Getty Images, FILE\n\n\u201cPhil was on the map with \u2018SNL\u2019 like never before,\u201d said Thomas of his take on Clinton.\n\nIn 1987, one year after Hartman joined \u201cSNL,\u201d Phil married Brynn Omdahl. It was his third marriage.\n\nThe couple welcomed their first child, a boy whom they named Sean, in 1988. After Sean was born, his ex-wife Lisa Jarvis says Phil Hartman called her.\n\n\u201cHe calls me and [says], \u2018I just became a father.\u2019 And so, I wrote a card. \u2018Dear Phil and Brynn, you know... much love from Aunt Lisa. You know, if you ever need a babysitter... I'm so thrilled for you,\u2019\u201d Jarvis said.\n\nJarvis said she \u201cgot back a letter that was hair-curling, fury, rage and [a] death threat from Brynn\u2026 The gist of it was, \u2018Don't ever f---ing get near me or my family or I will hurt you. I never want to hear from you\u2026never, ever, ever come near us or you will really be sorry.\u2019\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Greg Omdahl\n\nMeanwhile, Phil Hartman was soaring professionally. In 1989, he won an Emmy as part of the writing staff on \u201cSNL.\u201d\n\nIn 1991, while still an \u201cSNL\u201d cast member, Phil Hartman started working on \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d where he voiced two iconic characters: fading B-movie actor Troy McClure and sleazy lawyer Lionel Hutz.\n\n\u201cPhil made the material funnier than we originally imagined, and I couldn't imagine anybody else doing it,\u201d said Al Jean, the show\u2019s executive producer.\n\nThe Hartman family welcomed their second child \u2014 a daughter whom they named Birgen \u2014 in 1992.\n\n\u201cI remember him calling me when Birgen was born,\u201d said Lynne Stewart, a friend of Hartman\u2019s who played Miss Yvonne during his time with \u201cPee Wee\u2019s Playhouse.\u201d \u201cHe was very, very choked up... He said, \u2018She's the most beautiful baby in the world.\u2019\u201d\n\nGreg Omdahl also spoke to the Hartmans\u2019 love for their children, saying, \u201cWhen I watched the old home videos of Brynn and Phil and their kids, it really brought home what loving parents they were...and what a great mother she was.\u201d\n\nJoel Diamond, a friend of the couple, said that \u201cBrynn was the greatest mom; she was wonderful.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Greg Omdahl\n\nBut as the Hartman family grew, so did Phil Hartman\u2019s work schedule. In addition to \u201cSNL\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d he also did commercials for brands like Cheetos and McDonald\u2019s and became a regular on the late night talk show circuit.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t home nearly as much as she wanted him to be to take care of the kids \u2014 to be with her,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nBiographer Mike Thomas said he thought Phil Hartman \u201cmight have liked the idea of fatherhood a bit more than actually putting in the hard work that fatherhood requires. Because he was always working. And Brynn was resenting him more and more because of that.\u201d\n\nGreg Omdahl added that, at times, Brynn was jealous of her husband\u2019s celebrity status.\n\n\u201cPhil was getting a lot of attention and [Brynn] wasn't getting any attention\u2026 I suppose some of that's natural,\u201d Greg Omdahl said. \u201cShe just wanted to be more part of the spotlight than she was, you know.\u201d\n\nWith money pouring in, Phil Hartman bought boats, cars and a small airplane. He would spend time away from the family in Catalina Island, his favorite place in the whole world.\n\n\u201cMaybe she felt Phil was spending too much time with his boat or airplane\u2026 [and] not enough time with the kids,\u201d Greg Omdahl said. \u201cI would kind of reassure her that that's normal and that he still loved her.\u201d\n\nPhil Hartman\u2019s makeup artist on \u201cSNL,\u201d Norman Bryn, remembered one fight he overheard the couple having behind doors of an \u201cSNL\u201d dressing room, saying that Phil Hartman walked away from it \u201cwhite as a sheet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Phil, what's the matter?\u2019 And he said in a comedy Phil Hartman voice, \u2018Well, Norm, looks like the wife's gonna divorce me this time,\u2019\u201d Bryn said.\n\nPhil Hartman decided to leave \u201cSNL\u201d in 1994 after eight seasons on the show. He worked to develop his own variety show, \u201cThe Phil Show,\u201d but the project wasn\u2019t picked up, so in 1995, he signed on to an NBC sitcom called \u201cNewsRadio.\u201d\n\nThe comedian also landed big parts in movies. In 1996, Hartman starred with Steve Martin in \u201cSgt. Bilko.\u201d He was also in \u201cJingle All the Way\u201d with Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nMeanwhile, Brynn Hartman got two very minor roles \u2014 she had one line in the Rob Reiner movie \u201cNorth,\u201d where she played a cocktail waitress.\n\nShe also appeared in an episode of \u201cThird Rock from the Sun\u201d as an alien from Venus. According to friends, she was hoping for more work.\n\nAnd her substance abuse had not gone away. Phil Hartman\u2019s \u201cNewsRadio\u201d co-star Andy Dick told \u201c20/20\u201d that during a Christmas party in 1997, he gave Brynn some cocaine after she asked if he had any.\n\nDick asserts that he did not cause her to relapse: \u201cShe was already in relapse mode, which I didn't even know she had a problem [with] at all in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrynn had low self-esteem. She worried about looking older, getting older,\u201d Phil Hartman\u2019s friend Dawna Kaufmann added. \u201cThe month before they died, Brynn turned 40\u2026 For many women, a 40th birthday is a big line in the sand. An emotional event.\u201d\n\nShe was also taking the anti-depressant Zoloft.\n\nGreg Omdahl recalls, \u201cShe talked about having anxiety at times.\u201d\n\nThough some say they were fighting more than usual by this time, Greg Omdahl remembers it differently.\n\n\u201cThey had seen a counselor and both of them said that really helped and [that] they\u2019re trying to improve for their spouse. I mean, they cared that much about each other,\u201d he said.\n\nTragedy strikes the Hartman family\n\nThe exact details of what happened the night of May 27, 1998, and into the morning hours of May 28, 1998, remains somewhat of a mystery to this day.\n\n\u201cI was waiting for [Phil] to come home, because it was going to be the time for me to go,\u201d the family\u2019s babysitter Lorraine Moss said of that day. \u201cBrynn had just gone out and she wasn't going to be back till late. So Phil was going to take over in taking care of the children.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Greg Omdahl\n\nBrynn Hartman went out for drinks that night with her friend Christine Zander before driving over to her friend and former lover Ron Douglas\u2019 house at around 10:15 p.m.\n\nDouglas declined ABC News\u2019 requests for comment, but according to what he told police, Brynn Hartman had a few beers and complained to him about her husband. He told police she left his house at around 12:45 a.m., got into her car and returned home.\n\nSean Hartman would reportedly later tell police that he heard sounds he likened to \u201cthe slamming of a door.\u201d\n\nAt 3:45 am, as Ron Douglas would recount to police, he was awoken by someone\u2019s pounding on his front door. It was Brynn. She told Ron, \u201cI killed Phil. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\nDouglas told police he didn\u2019t believe her at first. But then, a gun fell out of Brynn\u2019s purse. He took it away from her and put it in the trunk of his car.\n\nThe two drove in separate cars back to the Hartman home, where Douglas found Phil\u2019s body in his bed. Police would later discover he had been shot three times. Ron stepped into the hallway to call 911. And then, he discovered Brynn had locked herself in the master bedroom.\n\nIt was about 6 am and the quiet street in Encino, California was suddenly swarming with police, news cameras, and a gathering crowd of onlookers. Ron handed the gun to police, but they had no idea if there were any other weapons in the house.\n\nAs nine-year-old Sean and six-year-old Birgen were being whisked to safety, another shot rang out. When police reached the master bedroom, they were greeted with silence.\n\n\u201cWe go through the door, we find a man [lying] on the bed, he has a bullet hole through his forehead. There's a woman [lying] next to him, and she also has a gunshot wound,\u201d responding LAPD officer Daniel Carnahan said. \u201cLooking at the bodies it's obvious\u2026 that they were not alive.\u201d\n\nBrynn had killed herself after taking Phil\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cFor me it is one of the most tragic scenes\u2026 [Hartman] had actually experienced the American dream that most people don't get to experience,\u201d Carnahan said. \u201cTo have that taken away in this fashion seems so contradictory and so out of place and so unfair.\u201d\n\nThe children were taken into police custody. Upon hearing the news, Diamond went to the police station and asked if he could take the kids out of the police station. He said police told him he could take them to a nearby park.\n\n\u201cI remember I was pushing Sean on a swing\u2026 I said, \u2018Sean\u2026is there anything I could do for you?\u2019 And he said, \u2018No.\u2019 He said, \u2018My mom promised me she'd take me to a lot of fun places and now she'll never be able to,\u2019\u201d Diamond said. \u201cBirgen looked like she was more in shock than anything else. And I remember her saying, \u2018I know I'll never see my mommy and daddy again.\u2019 I don't know how she knew, but it was one of the worst days of my life, seeing those kids.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles County medical examiner Craig Harvey later determined that Brynn Hartman had a blood-alcohol level of 0.12, as well as cocaine and Zoloft in her system that night.\n\nAt one point, Andy Dick says Phil Hartman\u2019s \u201cSNL\u201d co-star Jon Lovitz blamed him for causing Brynn Hartman\u2019s relapse, and in turn, the unthinkable murder-suicide.\n\n\u201cJon loved Phil and I know he was angry and he probably wanted somebody to blame in a sense,\u201d said Vicki Lewis, who played Beth on \u201cNewsRadio.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn't cause her to relapse. That's one of the misconceptions. That is not true. Not true. Like, for real,\u201d Dick said. \u201cI didn't cause her to relapse and I didn't give her cocaine and then she ran off, got a gun and shot her husband and herself. No\u2026that happened six months later.\u201d\n\nABC News reached out to Jon Lovitz who declined to comment.\n\nA year after the murder suicide, Greg Omdahl filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Pfizer, the maker of Zoloft, on behalf of the Hartman estate.\n\nOmdahl said, \u201cI did file a lawsuit against Pfizer\u2026 alleging that the use of Zoloft caused my sister to not to know what she was doing, and she shot her husband. And when she came out of that, she shot herself.\u201d\n\nWhen the lawsuit was filed in 1999, Pfizer gave a statement to Salon Health that \u201cthere\u2019s no scientific or medical evidence that Zoloft causes violent or suicidal behavior.\u201d The suit was settled for $100,000 and there was no admission of any wrongdoing.\n\nBrynn\u2019s sister Cathy and her husband raised both Sean and Birgen in the Midwest. Greg Omdahl said that \u201cthey grew up as loved children.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Greg Omdahl\n\nSean is now 31 years old and pursuing his dreams of being an artist and musician. Birgen, 27, married recently and started a business \u201cthat\u2019s doing [really] well,\u201d Greg Omdahl said.\n\nHe added: \u201cI believe my sister would be very proud of how Sean and Birgen have grown up and the people they've turned into.\u201d\n\nABC News' Allison Hope Weiner contributed to this report.", "description": "On May 27, 1998, the comedian was murdered by his wife at their home before she took her own life.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/hartmans-main-ht-ay-190916_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
