He has worked as a broadcast commentator for NBC, ESPN, CBS and Red Bull. He was placed on interim suspension last year by USA Skateboarding and is no longer listed as a member of any of the organization\u2019s committees.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAlberto Salazar, track coach who trained Olympians, banned four years by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency\n\nUSA judo\u2019s Jack Hatton, an Olympic hopeful and \u2018true role model,\u2019 dies at 24\n\nRussia\u2019s spot in the Tokyo Olympics is threatened amid new doping concerns\n\nThey were once sent home for their Olympic protest.
