REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo/File Photo\n\nMany of the Democratic presidential candidates have argued in favor of either breaking up or tightening regulation of firms such as Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google (GOOGL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).\n\nRepublican President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has also stepped up its scrutiny, announcing a wide-ranging investigation in July into whether major digital tech companies engaged in anti-competitive practices.\n\nTrump\u2019s Democratic challengers also criticize online platforms for allowing politicians to make false claims in advertising ahead of the election next November.\n\nSocial media platforms are under particular scrutiny after U.S. intelligence agencies said Russia used them to wage an influence operation to interfere with the 2016 election - a claim Moscow has denied.\n\nHere are some of the candidates\u2019 positions on Big Tech.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP\n\nTrump, whose social media use and digital advertising campaign helped propel him to the White House in 2016, in September attacked the \u201cimmense power\u201d of social media giants in his address to the United Nations.\n\nTrump has stopped short of calling for tech giants to be broken up, as Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have, but said \u201cobviously there is something going on in terms of monopoly,\u201d when asked about major tech companies in a June interview with CNBC.\n\nTrump and other Republicans have also criticized social media companies, without evidence, for alleged political bias.\n\nThe president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. wrote an opinion piece for The Hill political website in September entitled \u201cFree speech suppression online builds case to break up Big Tech.\u201d\n\nSilicon Valley firms have also been at odds with the Trump administration over policies such as its repeal of Obama-era net neutrality rules and the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on their supply chains.\n\nJOE BIDEN\n\nBiden, who was vice president in the Silicon Valley-friendly Obama administration, has taken a more moderate stance than his progressive rivals on the issue of big tech company break-ups.\n\nIn a May interview with the Associated Press, he said that splitting up companies such as Facebook was \u201csomething we should take a really hard look at\u201d but that it was \u201cpremature\u201d to make a final judgment.\n\nThe campaign told Reuters that, as president, Biden would aggressively use \u201call the tools available - including utilizing antitrust measures\u201d to ensure corporations act responsibly.\n\nHe did not speak up during a discussion of the issue at the most recent Democratic debate in October.\n\nBiden has criticized e-commerce giant Amazon\u2019s $0 federal tax bill in 2018.\n\n\u201cI have nothing against Amazon, but no company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers. We need to reward work, not just wealth,\u201d he said in a tweet in June.\n\nHis campaign also clashed with Facebook, Twitter and Google over their political ad policies after they refused to take down a Trump ad that the Biden team said contained false claims about his son Hunter\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nELIZABETH WARREN\n\nWarren is leading the charge to break up big tech companies on the grounds they hold outsized influence and stifle competition.\n\nShe has called for legislation to restrict large tech platforms - which she would designate as \u201cplatform utilities\u201d -from owning and participating in a marketplace at the same time.\n\nUnder this law, Apple would not be allowed to both run the App Store and sell its own apps on it, for example.\n\nShe also said she would nominate regulators to unwind anti-competitive mergers such as Facebook\u2019s deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, and Amazon\u2019s deal for Whole Foods.\n\nWarren in October challenged Facebook\u2019s policy of exempting politicians\u2019 ads from fact-checking by running ads containing the false claim that CEO Mark Zuckerberg was endorsing Trump\u2019s re-election bid.\n\nThe senator from Massachusetts has also said that she would reject campaign donations over $200 from executives of big tech firms.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS\n\nSanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who frequently criticizes corporate influence, has also called for the break-up of big tech companies such as Facebook and Amazon.\n\nHis administration would \u201cabsolutely\u201d try to split apart the companies, Sanders said at a Washington Post event in July.\n\nHe has said that he will have the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) review all mergers that have taken place during the Trump administration. His broad plan to reshape corporate America would also mandate all large companies to be owned partly by their workers.\n\nAsked how he differentiates himself from Warren on major issues, Sanders told ABC in October: \u201cElizabeth considers herself - if I got the quote correctly - to be a capitalist to her bones. I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSanders has been vocal in his attacks on Amazon over issues such as its tax contributions and working conditions at its warehouses. In 2018, he introduced a \u2018Stop BEZOS Act\u2019 in the Senate, in a reference to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, which would make large corporations either pay their workers more or pay the government for public benefits that their workers receive.\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG\n\nIn general, Pete Buttigieg, who became Facebook\u2019s 287th user shortly after it was launched in 2004 at Harvard University, where he was a student, has been more reluctant to slam the tech giants than some other candidates.\n\nThe mayor from South Bend, Indiana, said that the break-up of big tech companies is a \u201cremedy that should be on the table,\u201d but also said it was not a politician\u2019s place to designate which companies should be broken up.\n\nHe has said that the FTC should be empowered to prevent and sometimes reverse mergers, but argued that large tech companies should be scrutinized for their actions rather than their size. He says concerns over monopolies and concerns over data security or privacy should not be conflated.\n\nHe is in favor of having legislation to protect individual data rights at a national level, including the right to be forgotten - which would give citizens the power to demand that online platforms delete data about them, as is the case in Europe.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS\n\nSenator Harris of California, the home of Silicon Valley, has said that Facebook has not been sufficiently regulated. She has not called outright for the break-up of big tech firms but said it should be \u201cseriously\u201d considered.\n\nDuring the campaign, Harris touted her experience protecting consumers\u2019 online privacy while she was state attorney general.\n\nIn Congress, Harris, along with fellow candidate Senator Amy Klobuchar, introduced the bipartisan ENOUGH Act in 2017 to protect against online exploitation of private images.\n\nHarris recently called on Twitter TWTR.O to suspend Trump\u2019s Twitter account, saying his tweets threaten violence. In response, the company said that Trump\u2019s tweets did not violate its policies.\n\nAMY KLOBUCHAR\n\nThe Minnesota senator has made oversight of big technology companies one of her major issues in Congress and argued for data privacy laws and net neutrality safeguards as priorities at her campaign launch in February.\n\nKlobuchar has called for tighter regulation of tech giants and suggested that companies who profit from users\u2019 data could be taxed.\n\nShe has not endorsed Warren\u2019s plan for their break-up, saying that she would first want investigations. Her plan for her first 100 days in office includes an \u201caggressive retrospective review of mergers,\u201d which she said she would pay for with an extra merger fee on \u201cmegamergers.\u201d\n\nShe is also one of the authors of the bipartisan Honest Ads Act, which would require social media platforms to disclose the purchaser of a political ad, as is required for television and print ads.\n\nANDREW YANG\n\nYang, the former CEO of a start-up, has benefited from a surge of grassroots supporters on social media who style themselves as the #yanggang.\n\nAlthough the technology entrepreneur said \u201cwe would be well served\u201d if big tech companies were to break themselves up, he is more focused on dealing with the impact of automation on American jobs and on regulating artificial intelligence.\n\nYang has also emphasized the negative effects of tech on mental health and said he would create a Department of Attention Economy, ideally led by tech ethics advocate Tristan Harris, to look at how to responsibly design and use apps and devices.\n\nHe has also called for people to receive a share of the economic value generated from their data.\n\nCORY BOOKER\n\nNew Jersey Senator Booker said that Warren\u2019s call to break up the tech giants was \u201cmore like a Donald Trump thing to say\u201d and has instead argued that stronger antitrust laws need to be enforced.\n\nWhen questioned at the October Democratic debate on the issue, Booker advocated reforms to stop tech companies being used \u201cto undermine our democracy\u201d around elections.\n\nHe talked broadly about antitrust, \u201cfrom pharma to farms,\u201d but did not single out tech companies.\n\nA Stanford University graduate who co-founded his own social media start-up WayWire, Booker has historically received donations from major Silicon Valley names such as Zuckerberg. The Facebook CEO also donated $100 million to Newark schools when Booker was mayor of the New Jersey city.\n\nBETO O\u2019ROURKE\n\nO\u2019Rourke, a former U.S. representative from Texas, wants to see Big Tech regulated rather than broken up. He has said he does not think it is the role of a president to designate which companies should be dismantled.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign told Reuters he would stand up for small business by preventing online platform owners from promoting their own content and products over that of competitors. He also plans to create a new digital markets regulator to create and enforce rules on issues such as privacy and data mobility.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, who as a teenager was part of an influential hacking group, has also said he thinks social media companies should be treated as publishers.\n\nHe wants to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which generally provides immunity to online platforms for content posted by users, to make social media companies more accountable for the amplification of hate speech and domestic terrorism on their platforms.\n\nHis campaign recently urged Facebook, Twitter TWTR.O and Google to do more to combat online disinformation, after the campaign encountered the spread of a false claim about a gunman in a mass shooting.\n\nJULIAN CASTRO\n\nCastro, who was secretary of housing and urban development in the Obama administration, has said it is worth considering proposals to break up the big tech companies and said during the recent Democratic debate that the U.S. needs to take a stronger stance in cracking down on monopolistic trade practices.\n\nIn the October debate, the former mayor of San Antonio, Texas, also singled out Amazon by name for helping to \u201cput small businesses out of business\u201d and for \u201cshortchanging a lot of its workers.\u201d\n\nTULSI GABBARD\n\nGabbard, a U.S. representative from Hawaii, has called for the break-up of big tech companies and praised Warren\u2019s plan.\n\nIn July, she filed a $50 million lawsuit against Google accusing the company of discrimination when it temporarily suspended her ad account after the first Democratic debate. Google said the account had been automatically flagged for unusual activity, without specifying exactly what the issue was.\n\nGabbard said that Google\u2019s actions reflected \u201chow the increasing dominance of big tech companies over our public discourse threatens our core American values.\u201d\n\nTOM STEYER\n\nCalifornia billionaire Steyer has said he is running for president to remove the influence of corporate money from politics. In the October debate, he said that monopolies either have to be dismantled or regulated, but that to win against Trump, Democrats would have to \u201cshow the American people that we don\u2019t just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies.\u201d\n\nInstead, he said, Democrats must harness the innovation and competition of the private sector.\n\nSteyer\u2019s campaign has been noted for its massive ad spending which helped push him to the debate stage, including more than $6 million in Facebook ads, according to Democratic digital firm Bully Pulpit Interactive.", "description": "In the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, America's big tech companies are being challenged on many fronts from across the political spectrum, from antitrust concerns to their policies on political ads and ensuring election security.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Culliford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446143418&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0N4-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
