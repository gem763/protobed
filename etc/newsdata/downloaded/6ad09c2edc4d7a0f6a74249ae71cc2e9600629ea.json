All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey has reportedly requested a trade after getting into an argument with head coach Doug Marrone during Sunday\u2019s game, according to ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nThe Jaguars have spoken to teams about a deal, but there are no current plans to trade the 24-year-old Ramsey, according to Schefter.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nRamsey\u2019s trade request comes a day after he got into a heated argument with Marrone during Sunday\u2019s loss to the Houston Texans. Ramsey was reportedly upset after Marrone failed to challenge a catch by Texans receiver DeAndre Hopkins. Ramsey, who was in coverage during the play, believed Hopkins dropped the ball. A few plays later, the Texans kicked a field goal.\n\nAfter that drive ended, Marrone and Ramsey got into a nose-to-nose argument on the sideline. Another coach had to separate Ramsey and Marrone.\n\nFollowing the contest, Ramsey did not speak to the media. Marrone attempted to downplay the situation, saying he did not recall what the argument was about.\n\nSince joining the Jaguars in 2016, Ramsey has developed into one of the league\u2019s best cornerbacks. He\u2019s known not only for his spectacular play, but also for his penchant for trash talk.\n\nRamsey is under contract for one more season and is owed roughly $3.7 million in 2020.\n\nConsidering his talent, Ramsey should draw plenty of interest on the trade market. The Jaguars, however, are likely to demand a lot for one of the best cornerbacks in the game.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
