I think he's the greatest. But, when it comes to people and society and companies, we have to put that aside. Respect it, but you have to stay the course when it comes to human respect and human fight, human liberty.\"\n\nHONG KONG PROTESTERS SLAM LEBRON JAMES' CRITICISM OF DARYL MOREY TWEET: 'PEOPLE ARE ANGRY'\n\nJames first broke his silence on the issue Monday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to judge how the league handled the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think that, when you\u2019re misinformed or you\u2019re not educated about something \u2013 and I\u2019m just talking about the tweet itself \u2013 you never know the ramifications that can happen. We all see what that did, not only did for our league but for all of us in America, for people in China as well. Sometimes you have to think through the things that you say that may cause harm not only for yourself but for the majority of people. I think that\u2019s just a prime example of that.\u201d\n\nHe received massive criticism and followed up with a tweet: \u201cMy team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it.\u201d\n\nJames doubled down on Tuesday when talking to reporters and said he wasn\u2019t going to speak on the matter again.\n\n\u201cI'd be cheating my teammates by continuing to harp on something that won't benefit us trying to win a championship because that's what we're here for,\u201d James said. \u201cWe're not politicians. I think it's a huge political thing but we are leaders and we can step up at times. But ... you don't feel like you should speak upon things you shouldn't have to.\u201d\n\nHe added that he should be focused more on social justice issues in the U.S. than geopolitical issues thousands of miles away.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cThere's things that happen in my own community, trying to help my kids graduate high school and go off to college, what's been my main concern over the last couple years and my school,\u201d he said. \u201cTrying to make sure the inner city kids that grew up in my hometown can have a brighter future and look at me as inspiration to get out of the hellhole of the inner city. And we don't talk about those stories enough.\u201d", "description": "Muhammad Ali\u2019s ex-wife slammed LeBron James in wake of the Los Angeles Lakers superstar\u2019s comment that Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey was misinformed when he tweeted in support of pro-democracy Hong Kong protesters.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
