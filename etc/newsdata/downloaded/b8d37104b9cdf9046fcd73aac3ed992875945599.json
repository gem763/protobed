The patients who were their alleged victims suffered dementia\n\nInvestigators found that during the second incident, the elderly women - both dementia patients - fought each other in a bedroom, hitting each other as the staffers looked on without trying to physical stop the altercation, according to the News & Record. When one of the patients asked for help, a staffer - it's unclear which one - told her to 'stop screaming, (expletive).'\n\nAt some point during the fight, one of the elderly women began choking the other one. One of the staffers could be heard telling the woman to 'punch her in the face,' while another staffer tells her coworker to film the fight and send her the video.\n\nThe investigation stated that no injuries to the elderly women were reported or found.\n\nDuring the investigation, one of the staffers who was arrested allegedly told police that one of the elderly woman was a 'pain in the butt' and that was why they had recorded the videos of the incidents.\n\nJordan was arrested on October 2 and charged with one count of assaulting an individual with a disability. She was given a $1,500 unsecured bond.\n\nTyson was arrested on October 3 on the same assault charge.
