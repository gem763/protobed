These mostly minor issues have to be fixed before the end of the series \u2014 about nine days away.\n\nAnd though they are mostly minor, there\u2019s so many of them it\u2019s a major undertaking. Deb and Andy have the least, but they still have 79. Jesse and Mel have the most at 132. Mark and Mitch have 103.\n\nIt\u2019s when Keith and Dan are delivering this news that Mark gets in a major strop.\n\n\u201cWe will do what we can,\u201d Mark says.\n\n\u201cNo, we want you to do all that,\u201d Dan says. \u201cMitch is going to have to put in.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe always has done,\u201d Mark says. \u201cI\u2019m really offended by that. He works his guts out and I won\u2019t have anyone stand here and suggest he doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s offensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said the same thing to all the other contestants. Nobody\u2019s taken offence to it and I apologise if you\u2019ve taken offence,\u201d Dan says.\n\n\u201cOh mate, that was uncomfortable,\u201d Keith says later.\n\nIt\u2019s been a season of uncomfortable moments. From Mark and Mitch being caught out in a lie over their accusations Jesse and Mel were cheating, to that earlier homophobia row.\n\nMel, bless her heart, decides it would be wrong to finish the series with any bad blood, so arranges a caterer and invites the other teams over for a dinner party.\n\nAs each contestant talks about their favourite memories of the show it looks like Mel has a future running the UN.\n\n\u201cI want to have some happiness in my last week,\u201d Mark says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make it happen,\u201d Mel says. \u201cLet\u2019s all make it happen.\u201d\n\nDeb and Andy are in tears.\n\n\u201cI want to finish strong with nine fantastic people who understand what we\u2019ve been through,\u201d she says.\n\nDoes that mean there will be no sniping, bitching or complaining in the final week?\n\nGiven the explosive interview Tess and Luke gave to News.com.au last week accusing the producers of stitching them up to make them look lazy, it\u2019s clear the season didn\u2019t end with unicorns and butterflies for everyone, but for the moment at least, peace reigns over Oslo.\n\nMISSED AN EPISODE?\n\n\n\nEP 51 recap: Scott Cam blows up at Tess and Luke\n\n\n\nEP 50 recap: Block budgeting goodie goodies go bankrupt\n\n\n\nEP 49 recap: Block room \u2018looks like a public toilet\u2019\n\nEP 47/48 recap: Tess and Luke\u2019s marriage fears\n\n\n\nEP 46: Mitch and Jesse go head to head\n\n\n\nEP 45 recap: Judges slam pathetic balcony\n\n\n\n\n\nEP 43/44 recap: Has Mel had enough of her \u2018worst boyfriend\u2019\n\nEP 42 recap: Scott Cam blows his stack at contestant\n\n\n\nEP 41 recap: Room brings Shaynna Blaze to tears\n\n\n\nEP 39/40 recap: Tess and Luke finally run out of cash\n\n\n\nEP 38 recap: Mark and Mitch blow their stacks\n\nEP 37 recap: Will Tess and Luke walk out?\n\n\n\nEP 35 and 36 recap: Reason for Tess and Luke\u2019s devastation\n\nEP 34 recap: Mitch puts his foot through the ceiling\n\nEP 32 recap: producer dragged into cheating scandal\n\n\n\nEP 30 recap: \u2018Dog\u2019s breakfast\u2019: kitchen savagely mocked\n\nEP 29 recap: Scott Cam gives contestants a serve\n\nEP 27/28 recap: Gloves are off as teams threaten to quit\n\nEP 26 recap: Tess and Luke flush another tradie\n\nEP 25 recap: Is this the best bathroom on the Block ever?\n\nEP 24 recap: Is this the best Block bathroom ever?\n\nEP 23 recap: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry\u201d \u2013 Mark and Mitch patch things up with Scott\n\n\n\nEP 22 recap: What made Scott Cam storm off?\n\nEP 21 recap: Homophobia row rocks The Block\n\n\n\nEP 19/ 20 recap: \u2018you just told me my baby is ugly\u2019\n\nEP 18 recap: Tess\u2019 expletive-filled tirade after tradie sacking\n\nEP 17 recap: Loo controversy sinks two teams\n\nEP 15/16 recap: What made Mitch snap?\n\nEP 14 recap: Jesse and Keith\u2019s blow up\n\nEP 13 recap: Judges slam Mark and Mitch\n\nEP 11/12: Big move may blow up friendship\n\nEP 10 recap: Why Scott Cam locked a contestant in car\n\nEP 9 recap: How Jesse insulted Shaynna\n\nEP 7/8: \u2018Don\u2019t be nice to them\u2019.
