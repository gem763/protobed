The auction house will feature the painting at its evening sale of post-war and contemporary art on Nov. 13.\n\nHockney, 82, began painting Sur la Terrasse (meaning \u201con the terrace\u201d)in March 1971, and completed it that summer during a time he and Schlesinger\u2019s relationship declined. The two met in 1966 while Hockney was teaching at the University of California at Los Angeles, where Schlesinger, now 71, was an art student and model.\n\nThe canvas was based on a series of photographs taken on the balcony of the couple\u2019s room at the H\u00f4tel de la Mamounia in Marrakesh, Morocco, where they had spent two weeks in Feb. 1971, according to Christie\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThis work marks a momentous turning point in the artist\u2019s personal and professional lives,\u201d Ana Maria Celis, head of evening sale of post-war and contemporary art at Christie\u2019s, said in a statement. \u201cThe tenderness and nostalgia of this moment is unmistakable in Schlesinger\u2019s position with his back facing the artist, as he looks into the wilds that lie beyond their hotel terrace in Marrakesh.\u201d\n\nBy casting himself as a voyeur, Hockney was bidding a private farewell to his lover. The sense of estrangement was revisited in his iconic 1972 work, Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), which also depicts Schlesinger.\n\nPortrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) sold for $90 million at Christie\u2019s New York in November 2018, marking the most expensive work for a living artist and breaking the previous record set by the 2013 sale of Jeff Koons \u2019 Balloon Dog (Orange) for $58.4 million. The honor was reclaimed by Koons in May 2019, when his Rabbit sold for more than $91 million at Christie\u2019s in New York.\n\nSur la Terrasse will be on view at Christie\u2019s Los Angeles galleries starting Oct. 15.", "description": "The 1971 painting has been in a private collection for nearly half a century", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-117653/social", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
