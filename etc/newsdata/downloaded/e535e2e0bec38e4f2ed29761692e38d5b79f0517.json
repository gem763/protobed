A lovely man and a consummate actor. I met him on the movie Alligator (pic) 40 years ago, and then again on BB. I never forgot how kind and generous he was to a young kid just starting out in Hollywood. RIP Bob. pic.twitter.com/HtunD0Fx6g \u2014 Bryan Cranston (@BryanCranston) October 12, 2019\n\nThe two met on the 1980 film Alligator and then worked together again on the television show Breaking Bad and its spin-off film, El Camino, which launched on Netflix.\n\nRobert Forster (Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)\n\n\u201cI never forgot how kind and generous he was to a young kid just starting out in Hollywood,\u201d Cranston wrote.\n\nHis Jackie Brown co-star Samuel L Jackson tweeted that Forster was \u201ctruly a class act/Actor!!\u201d\n\nA native of Rochester, New York, Forster stumbled into acting when in college, intending to be a lawyer, he followed a fellow female student he was trying to talk to into an auditorium where \u201cBye Bye Birdie\u201d auditions were being held.\n\nRIP Robert Forster!! A truly class act/ Actor!! \u2014 Samuel L. Jackson (@SamuelLJackson) October 12, 2019\n\nHe would be cast in that show, that fellow student would become his wife with whom he had three daughters, and it would start him on a new trajectory as an actor.\n\nA role in the 1965 Broadway production Mrs Dally Has A Lover put him on the radar of Darryl Zanuck, who signed him to a studio contract.\n\nHe would soon make his film debut in the 1967 John Huston film Reflections In A Golden Eye, which starred Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nForster would go on to star in Haskell Wexler\u2019s documentary-style Chicago classic Medium Cool and the detective television series Banyon.\n\nIt was an early high point that he would later say was the beginning of a \u201c27-year slump\u201d.\n\nHe worked consistently throughout the 1970s and 1980s in mostly forgettable B-movies \u2014 ultimately appearing in over 100 films, many out of necessity.\n\n\u201cI had four kids, I took any job I could get,\u201d he said in an interview with the Chicago Tribune last year.\n\n\u201cEvery time it reached a lower level I thought I could tolerate, it dropped some more, and then some more. Near the end, I had no agent, no manager, no lawyer, no nothing. I was taking whatever fell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nIt was Quentin Tarantino\u2019s 1997 film Jackie Brown that put him back on the map.\n\nTarantino created the role of Max Cherry with Forster in mind \u2014 the actor had unsuccessfully auditioned for a part in Reservoir Dogs, but the director promised not to forget him.\n\nIn an interview with Fandor last year, Forster recalled that when presented with the script for Jackie Brown, he told Tarantino, \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re not going to let you hire me.\u201d\n\nTarantino replied: \u201cI hire anybody I want.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s when I realised I was going to get another shot at a career,\u201d Forster said.\n\n\u201cHe gave me a career back and the last 14 years have been fabulous.\u201d\n\nThe performance opposite Pam Grier became one of the more heartwarming Hollywood comeback stories, earning him his first and only Academy Award nomination.\n\nHe ultimately lost the golden statuette to Robin Williams, who won that year for Good Will Hunting.\n\nAfter Jackie Brown, he worked consistently and at a decidedly higher level than during the \u201cslump\u201d, appearing in films like David Lynch\u2019s Mulholland Drive, Me, Myself And Irene, The Descendants, Olympus Has Fallen, and What They Had, and in television shows like Breaking Bad and the Twin Peaks revival.\n\nHe will also appear later this year in the Steven Spielberg-produced Apple+ series Amazing Stories.\n\nForster is survived by his four children, four grandchildren and Ms Grayson, his partner of 16 years.", "description": "Condolences have poured on social media.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/07/wire-19619080-1570863225-401_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
