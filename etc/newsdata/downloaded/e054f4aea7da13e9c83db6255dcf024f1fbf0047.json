I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories on a very busy Monday morning.\n\nThomas Cook has finally gone bust after last-ditch talks failed to provide \u00a3200m in new funding for the stricken travel company, placing 9,000 jobs at risk in Britain alone and triggering the biggest peacetime repatriation effort to help 150,000 stranded holidaymakers. The Civil Aviation Authority announced at 2am that the company, the world\u2019s oldest travel firm, had ceased trading and that all related flights and bookings had been cancelled. You can follow all the latest developments on our live blog here. The company\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, said the collapse was a \u201cmatter of profound regret\u201d and he apologised to the company\u2019s \u201cmillions of customers, and thousands of employees\u201d. Boris Johnson hinted at possible government action against directors of travel firms who presided over bankruptcies. With Thomas Cook planes grounded, a huge plan \u2013 codenamed Operation Matterhorn \u2013 will swing into effect today to bring travellers home. British Airways and easyJet will be among the airlines providing aircraft to repatriate people stranded abroad in destinations from mainland Europe to north Africa, the Middle East, the US and the Caribbean. Hundreds of thousands of Thomas Cook customers from other countries are also facing uncertainty.\n\nYou can find the the answers to all your questions about what happens now in our Q&A here. And read an analysis from our business staff on how online competition and massive debts finally proved too much for the venerable company founded in 1841, which has more than 500 shops on Britain\u2019s high streets and employs thousands more people overseas.\n\nLabour clash \u2013 Pro-European Labour MPs have succeeded in forcing a vote at the party conference today on whether the party should campaign for remain in the next general election. Jeremy Corbyn has tried to neutralise the contentious issue by saying the party won\u2019t decide until after it forms a government. But rebel MPs and activists have managed to bring a motion at the conference in Brighton that sets them on a collision course with the leader. On Sunday, activists voted for a radical policy to abolish private schools.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Phoebe Waller-Bridge with her three Emmys. Photograph: Monica Almeida/Reuters\n\n\u2018This is just getting ridiculous\u2019 \u2013 British stars have dominated the Emmy awards in Los Angeles overnight, with Phoebe Waller-Bridge winning three gongs for her series Fleabag as it swept the comedy accolades. The programme that started life as her one-woman show in Edinburgh was judged best comedy series, and she also won for best writing and best actress, the latter a surprise win ahead of much-tipped Julia Louis-Dreyfus for Veep. As she began her third winner\u2019s speech she said: \u201cThis is just getting ridculous.\u201d She could also claim a hand in another award when her writing for Killing Eve helped Jodie Comer win best actress in a drama series. Ben Whishaw was handed the best supporting actor prize for A Very English Scandal and John Oliver won for his talk series Last Week Tonight. Game of Thrones was nominated for 32 awards and came away with the prize for outstanding drama series and a best supporting actor for American star Peter Dinklage. Here\u2019s a full list of winners and you can also read how the night unfolded.\n\nPM to NYC \u2013 Boris Johnson arrived in New York for the UN general assembly overnight but has been fielding questions on several fronts on his way. First, he played down speculation that he might make a breakthrough on Brexit this week when he holds a series of meetings with European leaders also attending the summit. He claimed that EU leaders might not \u201cnecessarily have an attachment to the backstop\u201d, but conceded there were still \u201cgaps and difficulties\u201d. The PM also told reporters on his flight to the US that the government now believes Iran was responsible for the drone attack on Saudi oil facilities earlier this month, raising the possibility that the British military could become involved in helping secure the Saudis against future aggression. And he also had time to deny six times giving his friend Jennifer Arcuri access to taxpayers\u2019 money for her business.\n\n\u2018No time to lose\u2019 \u2013 Still in New York, the climate science body United in Science has warned world leaders gathering for the UN summit that countries must at least triple their carbon emissions targets if the world is going to limit global heating to 2C. The report says current plans would lead to a rise in average global temperatures of between 2.9C and 3.4C by 2100. Severe heatwaves, record-breaking wildfires, declining sea ice and glaciers, cyclones, floods and drought, have all hit sooner and harder than predicted a decade ago, it says, and the period 2014-19 has been the warmest five-year-period on record. UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who presides over the climate action summit this week, says \u201cwe have no time to lose\u201d.\n\nHousing crisis \u2013 An estimated 8.4 million people are living in unsuitable housing, making them more likely to experience homelessness, serious debt and poor health . A survey of 40,000 people for the National Housing Federation estimated that 3.6 million are living in an overcrowded home, 2.5 million are unable to afford their rent or mortgage and 2.5 million cannot afford to move out of house shares or their parents\u2019 house. Another study today shows that the number of empty houses in Britain increased by almost 11,000 to 216,000 last year.\n\nToday in Focus podcast\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the war in Iraq, Katharine Gun exposed a US plot to spy on the UN in leaks published in the Observer.

Photograph: Richard Juillart/AFP\n\nThe mysterious end to the heroic life of Raoul Wallenberg has puzzled and troubled historians, governments and his family since he disappeared into the Soviet prison system in 1945. The Swedish diplomat had by that time saved an estimated 30,000 Hungarian Jews from the Nazi deaths camps but it has never been established exactly how, when or where he perished. This week his nieces are travelling to Stockholm to demand \u201cspecific answers to specific questions\u201d after what they believe has been a decades-long coverup. \u201cHis story is unfinished \u2013 the mystery must be resolved. There are still so many closed doors, and we must have help in opening them,\u201d says his niece Marie von Dardel-Dupuy.\n\nSport\n\nBilly Vunipola, the England No 8 with Tongan heritage, is unbowed after emerging unscathed from a bruising Rugby World Cup encounter and here are five talking points from the match.

Sebastian Vettel won the Singapore Grand Prix in a Ferrari one-two finish, but Charles Leclerc was unhappy with team orders. And Danny Willett says he is enjoying his golf again after winning the PGA Championship at Wentworth.\n\nBusiness\n\nA grim warning about the perils of a no-deal Brexit comes from the European car industry, whose leading lights say today that it will have a \u201cseismic\u201d impact on the automotive sector. The FTSE100 is expected to open flat this morning despite a positive move by Asian stocks overnight on reports that renewed US-China trade talks had gone reasonably well. Sterling is sitting at $1.249 and \u20ac1.132.\n\nThe papers\n\nThe Labour party\u2019s Brexit woes provide the lead for several papers. The Guardian splashes with \u201cRevolt over Brexit policy throws Labour into chaos\u201d while the Telegraph reports \u201cLabour will be crushed over Brexit, Corbyn told\u201d. The i cuts to the chase and announces \u201cLabour civil war\u201d.
