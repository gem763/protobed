These benefits include:\n\nShare reductions from buybacks allow the stock to increase its dividends per share.\n\nBuybacks act as a natural buffer for the stock.\n\nEarnings per share increases for the same amount of net income.\n\nBuybacks act to sterilize share dilution from management and employee options.\n\nLower share counts over time increase the remaining shareholders\u2019 stake in the company.\n\nCompared to dividends, buybacks are a much more tax-efficient return of capital.\n\nFor these reasons, there is a clear trend in the United States stock market for companies to spend more on share buybacks. CNBC recently reported that according to a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) study, U.S. share buybacks are expected to hit $1 trillion this year. Corporations are using over 104% of their free cash flow for buybacks, up from 82% last year.\n\nI\u2019m going to focus on five stocks that pay shareholders dividends and have large share buyback programs. Combined, these dividends and buybacks provide large total yields. And over time, these stocks are likely to be good investments.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n\n\n\n\nDividend Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL)\n\nDividend Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL) More\n\nSource: thanat sasipatanapa / Shutterstock.com\n\nDividend Yield: 1.4%\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has an attractive 1.4% dividend yield. But it returns even more capital to shareholders through its large share buyback program. AAPL has spent over 107% of its free cash flow on buybacks in the past year. The company has cut its shares by 32% in the last six years.\n\nBased on recent analysis, Apple stock will have an estimated 6.5% buyback yield over the next year, giving it a nearly 8% total yield.\n\nFor example, AAPL recently reported that it spent $17 billion in share repurchases and $3.6 billion in dividends in its most recent quarter. The buybacks alone, if continued each quarter, represent on an annualized basis just under 7% of its market value ($68 billion dividend by $975 billion).\n\nExpect good things from Apple\u2019s stock buyback program in the years to come, including higher dividends per share and higher earnings per share.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\n10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 More\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nDividend Yield: 1.4%\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock yields 1.4% and has a large share buyback program. It just completed a $25 billion share repurchase program. In the past quarter alone, MSFT spent $7.7 billion on shareholders, including $4.2 billion in share buybacks.\n\nThese repurchases have reduced the amount of MSFT shares outstanding by over 30% in the past 15 years. Since Microsoft stock has a $1 trillion market value, its annual spending of over $16 billion in buybacks represents a 1.6% buyback yield. Combined with the 1.4% dividend yield, MSFT sports a 3% total yield.\n\n\n\n\n\nOracle (ORCL)\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nDividend Yield: 1.7%\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock has a 1.7% dividend yield, but has a massive buyback program. In the past year alone, ORCL spent $36 billion on buybacks, representing 20% of its $182 billion market value.\n\nIn its last eight fiscal years, ORCL has reduced its share count by over 33% using its free cash flow to repurchase shares. All eyes are going to be on ORCL\u2019s August fiscal first-quarter earnings statement to see how many shares it has bought back. Since ORCL spent over 280% of its free cash flow on buybacks, effectively drawing down its cash balance, I suspect ORCL\u2019s buyback activity may have been reduced for the August quarter.", "description": "Stocks that pay good dividends and also have significant stock buyback programs provide numerous benefits to investors.
