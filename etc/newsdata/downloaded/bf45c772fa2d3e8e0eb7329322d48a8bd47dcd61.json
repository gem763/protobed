(Charles Dharapak/AP)\n\nPentagon officials on Monday recommended a restrained response to the recent attacks on Saudi oil facilities, arguing against a potentially costly conflict with Iran, which the administration has blamed for the strike on a key American ally, according to officials familiar with Defense Department deliberations.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper met with President Trump and key national security officials at the White House on Monday, two days after a series of explosions crippled two oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, disrupting more than half the Sunni kingdom\u2019s oil supply and dramatically escalating tensions with its chief rival, Shiite power Iran.\n\nWhile Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attacks, Trump administration officials have said they believe that at least the bulk of the strikes, which targeted two facilities belonging to state-run Saudi oil firm Aramco, were launched from within Iran \u2014 an allegation that, if true, would represent a major escalation between the Middle East\u2019s leading regional powers.\n\n[Who are the Houthis?]\n\nIn a message posted on Twitter, Esper, who took over at the Pentagon in the midst of a previous confrontation with Iran in June, said the U.S. military and other government agencies were \u201cworking with our partners to address this unprecedented attack and defend the international rules-based order that is being undermined by Iran.\u201d\n\nBut military officials are also privately urging caution, seeking to defuse tensions they believe could push the United States into a possibly bloody conflict with Iran at a time when the Pentagon is seeking to wind down insurgent wars in the Middle East and reorient toward competition with China.\n\nThe officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe their views, sought to emphasize the fact that no American personnel or facilities had been targeted in the weekend attacks, suggesting that a direct U.S. military response might not be merited. They also said that, if such a move was deemed necessary, the administration would need to find a valid legal basis to take action.\n\nPentagon officials have also stressed the risks to the at least 70,000 U.S. personnel stationed under U.S. Central Command, which stretches from Egypt to Pakistan, if tensions with Iran spin out of control.\n\nDefense officials have repeatedly raised similar concerns as the Trump administration has embraced a hawkish policy toward Iran over the past 18 months, including the president\u2019s decision to withdraw from his predecessor\u2019s nuclear deal with Tehran and to impose harsh new sanctions on Iran and its affiliates.\n\nIn June, following the downing of an American drone, Trump authorized and then called off a series of strikes on military sites within Iran. He said at the time that he changed his mind after being informed that up to 150 Iranian troops would die.\n\nBut on Monday, Trump suggested that a retaliatory attack in coming days might be appropriate. The president, asked by a reporter whether a lethal strike would be proportional to the latest violence, responded: \u201cI would say yes.\u201d\n\nThe attacks Saturday came less than a week after the departure of national security adviser John Bolton, who spearheaded the administration\u2019s tough Iran stance. While Pentagon officials had privately voiced concerns that Bolton might \u2014 inadvertently or otherwise \u2014 lead the United States into war, they have found an ally in a president who has expressed a desire to avoid new open-ended military action.\n\n[John Bolton\u2019s turbulent tenure comes to a Trumpian end]\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the administration\u2019s Iran policy might change following Bolton\u2019s departure. Other top officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, also hold hard-line views on Iran, as do influential Trump allies such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.).\n\nDefense and intelligence officials are working to compile information, which may be made public in some form to bolster administration claims of Iranian responsibility for the attack, officials said.\n\nRegarding Iran\u2019s alleged role in the attack, Trump told reporters on Monday that it was \u201clooking that way\u201d but said he hoped to avoid a conflict. \u201cI\u2019m somebody that would like not to have war,\u201d he said.\n\nAs discussions continue, Pentagon officials may suggest taking new deterrent measures short of direct use of force, such as increasing the number of troops in the region and hardening U.S. defenses, officials said.\n\nJim Stavridis, a retired four-star admiral who once served as NATO\u2019s top military commander, said that if the United States is certain of Iran\u2019s involvement in the attacks, the next steps could include presenting the evidence to the international community or condemning Tehran before the U.N. Security Council.\n\nThe administration might also attempt to peel European allies away from the Iranian nuclear deal, intensify sanctions, or mount missile or covert attacks against Iranian energy infrastructure as a reciprocal measure, he said.\n\nStavridis argued that any reaction would be best carried out with allies on board. He predicted that Saudi Arabia would initially resist an overt retaliatory attack and would instead want to bolster its missile and cyber defenses and urge allies to join military operations protecting commercial shipping around the Persian Gulf.\n\nAs officials consider their options, they must also navigate resistance on Capitol Hill, where some lawmakers are seeking to constrain the administration\u2019s ability to launch military action against Tehran.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s behavior in the region is highly problematic on many levels, but Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil interests do not determine whether the United States goes to war \u2014 the U.S. Congress does,\u201d Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) said in a statement on Monday.\n\nRobert Malley, who was a senior Middle East official in the Obama White House and now serves as president of the International Crisis Group, said the administration could seek to develop a legal basis for a retaliatory attack if it was determined to pursue one, even if Congress did not issue an explicit authorization.\n\n\u201cMore often than not, the legal argument is used as cover for a political decision about whether to go to war or not,\u201d he said.\n\nIf the president decides against an overt military response, he could also turn to cyber action. In June, when Trump was contemplating a missile strike against Iran, the Pentagon teed up a cyber option to help enable the strike. It involved Cyber Command disabling Iranian computer systems that controlled missile and rocket launches to prevent them from shooting down American weapons, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nCyber Command in June instead conducted a different operation, disrupting a computer database used by Iran to plan attacks on oil tankers in the Persian Gulf hours after Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps shot down a U.S. surveillance drone in the region. Such actions are considered by the Pentagon to fall below the use of force and are seen as effective without risking open conflict.\n\nEven as officials suggested that no military steps were imminent, the possibility of an unexpected White House decision hung over Pentagon discussions about the recent attacks.\n\n\u201cI suspect everyone takes a breath,\u201d Stavridis said, especially until the government has a more complete picture of the attacks. \u201cBut nobody really knows.\u201d\n\nPaul Sonne in London and Ellen Nakashima in Washington contributed to this report.", "description": "Military leaders are concerned about the possibility of a costly conflict with Iran, suspected in the attacks.", "authors": ["Missy Ryan", "Reporter Covering The Pentagon", "Military Issues", "National Security", "Dan Lamothe", "The U.S. Military", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/M3fuajJbr7jWNltvzeLKpic6O9Y=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PSICRBHXKUI6RDE2QYGOFKAUR4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
