Countries that are its friends are too ashamed of being in a coalition with them,\" he said, referring to reports that some countries, including Germany, have refused to take part in the mission.\n\n\"They brought this situation upon themselves, with lawbreaking, by creating tensions and crises.\"\n\n190729112714738\n\nOn Monday, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas reiterated that Germany would not join the US-led naval mission in the Strait of Hormuz, adding that Berlin favoured a European mission but warned it was difficult to make progress on that.\n\n\"At the moment, the Britons would rather join an American mission. We won't do that,\" Maas told reporters.\n\nIn June, Iran shot down an American surveillance drone in the strategic passageway.\n\nTrump came close to retaliating, but said he called off an airstrike at the last moment. Washington has since claimed that a US warship downed an Iranian drone in the strait. Iran denies losing any aircraft in the area.\n\nZarif however did not rule out talks in the future.\n\n\n\n\"In my view, negotiations and diplomacy will never end. Negotiation has always been and will always be on my agenda. Even in times of war negotiations will exist.\"", "description": "Tehran's chief diplomat laments US decision but keeps door open for talks in the future.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/8/5/f894236e94084ea9933295b35638801b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-05"}
