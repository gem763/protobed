Carter, the nation's 39th president and oldest-living former president in U.S. history at 94 years old, lives a fairly normal \u2014 and frugal \u2014 life, according to The Washington Post. In fact, Carter still lives in the ranch house he built himself in 1961. The home, in rural Plains, Georgia (about a 2\u00bd-hour drive south of Atlanta) is a two-bedroom ranch assessed at just $167,000, which is \"less than the value of the armored Secret Service vehicles parked outside,\" the Post reports. It's also less than the median home price in Georgia, which is $175,300, according to real estate site Zillow.\n\nJimmy Carter's Georgia home Library of Congress\n\nIn recent years, Carter has made much of his income from writing books, the Post reports; he has published at least 33, including a children's book and reflections on his presidency. (Thriftbooks.com lists 46 books.) Carter also receives a $210,700 annual pension, as do all former presidents, plus the federal government gives all ex-presidents an allowance for things like travel and office space. In 2017, Carter got more than $230,000 in such allowances, according to the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, a conservative advocacy group.\n\nA porch view of Jimmy Carter's Georgia house Library of Congress\n\nCarter's modest lifestyle is sharply different from those of other living former presidents. In 2017, former President Barack Obama purchased an $8.1 million mansion in Washington, and is well known for his family's tradition of taking a summer vacation to the picturesque (and pricey) Martha's Vineyard. The secluded property they would rent out for those vacations just sold for $15 million.", "description": "He never embraced the luxurious lifestyle that many former presidents live post-White House.", "authors": ["Sarah Berger"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105408713-1534875859694gettyimages-612092478.jpg?v=1534875931", "published_at": "2018-08-22"}
