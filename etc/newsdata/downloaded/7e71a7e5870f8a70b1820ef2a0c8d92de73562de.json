AAPL 0.66% said it is keeping assembly of its new Mac Pro in Texas, reversing earlier plans to shift manufacturing of the computer to China.\n\nThe decision follows the Trump administration\u2019s granting Apple exemptions last week from tariffs on 10 items it imported from China. The exclusions for components, including a power supply and a logic board, cover a period from September of last year to August 2020, and the U.S. will refund tariffs already paid.\n\nThe tech giant had earlier tapped Taiwanese contractor Quanta Computer Inc. to manufacture the nearly $6,000 desktop computer outside Shanghai. The previous version of the high-end computer, which was introduced in 2013, had been assembled in Austin, Texas, by contractor Flex Ltd. and was touted as Apple\u2019s only Made in USA product.\n\nEscalating trade tensions over the summer challenged Apple\u2019s plans to make the product in China, where labor and logistics costs are lower than in the U.S. In August, President Trump said he planned to extend tariffs of 10% to essentially all Chinese imports in December and raise tariffs on items already subject to duties. The tariffs could have cut into Apple\u2019s profits or forced it to increase the cost of its $5,999 Mac Pro made in China. Apple\u2019s decision to reverse course and instead keep the computer\u2019s assembly in Texas is among the most pronounced examples of how tariffs have roiled operations. Former operations employees and current suppliers say they have spent much of the past year evaluating contingency plans for products that are assembled in China, as the company looks to avoid tariffs.
