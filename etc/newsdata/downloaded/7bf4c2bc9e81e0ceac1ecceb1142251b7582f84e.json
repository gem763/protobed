It seems to command the whole of the valley from Stroud up to Bulls Cross. And behind me is Slad, my little village in the valley itself.\n\nI was brought up here, I was born here and I\u2019m still living here, and I feel I know every detail of all this countryside around. And it\u2019s not only the trees and the stones and the houses, it\u2019s the people. So when I think of this place it turns slowly to the seasons and becomes a different person, equally beautiful, from spring to winter.\n\nBut the people are the same. They are rooted. They don\u2019t move and they teach me their irreplaceability and I\u2019ve learned that I don\u2019t move either. I come back and here I stay.\n\nCider With Rosie was Laurie Lee\u2019s paean to growing up in the bucolic English countryside after World War I. Pictured: Joe Roberts as Laurie and Lia Barrow as Rosie in ITV\u2019s 1998 version of Cider With Rosie\n\nI was trying to describe it once to friends, and I said that living in our valley was like being broad beans in a pod, so snug and enclosed and protective.\n\nIt changed so that in spring and summer and autumn and winter it was a different place, a different country almost and we boys, as kids, were all ready to change our own attitude, our own games. It was either skating or it was snowballing or it was climbing trees, scragging apples. Whatever was true to that particular season.\n\nBut summer was a time for playing and the whole valley became our playground.\n\nChaps going up through the street, saying to the ladies: \u2018Hot enough for yer then?\u2019 To be answered with a worn-out shriek.\n\nDogs lying under rain butts, to get out of the heat. And we boys lying in the grass, listening to the loops of cuckoos going across the valley and not knowing what to do, having nothing to do.\n\nWell, having laid down and done nothing because there was nothing to do, someone would say: \u2018Well let\u2019s go down the pond then.\u2019 So we\u2019d get up and go down the pond, and halfway down there was a little village shop on the corner by the old Elizabethan house, where we\u2019d buy some sherbet dabs.\n\nThat is what I remember as being an element of a summer\u2019s day, to buy sherbet dabs with a liquorice tube in it. If you sucked it was all right but if you blew, the bag exploded and you choked in a sort of paroxysm of sherbet and people coughing all over the road.\n\nComing out of school, haymaking. We\u2019d rush off to the farms and say: \u2018Can we help?\u2019 Anything to get out into the fields after a long day of tables. And then going off, helping the men forking sheaves onto the wagons and then getting waylaid.\n\nThe young Laurie Lee (third right) and his friend Rosie (second right) are pictured together with other Slad village children\n\nIt wasn\u2019t as deliberate as all that. We didn\u2019t go over there to be seduced, we went over there to be a man and to help the men with the haymaking.\n\nBut there was always, well not always, a Rosie type in the grass, waiting to waylay one of we sturdy lads. That was their job, temptresses. Temptresses of summer, and this one stopped me. I wasn\u2019t looking for trouble but I got it. She said: \u2018I got somat to show ye then.\u2019\n\nI said: \u2018You ain\u2019t.\u2019\n\n\u2018I have. Come here.\u2019\n\nSo I stuck my fork into the ringing ground and followed her like doom and we went down onto a wagon festooned with grasses and she beckoned me under the wagon where there lay a large stone jar. \u2018It\u2019s cider, you ain\u2019t to drink it though, not much of it at any rate.\u2019\n\nSo we unstopped it and I held it to my mouth. Never to be forgotten, that first long drink of golden fire. Wine of wild orchards. And of that valley and of that time and of Rosie\u2019s burning cheeks. Never to be forgotten or ever tasted again.\n\nThat\u2019s what haymaking meant to me, and that\u2019s what cider meant to me. That\u2019s why it got me into trouble. But it wasn\u2019t haymaking.\n\nThe step, the first half-step towards willing, half-willing seduction and it taught me a lesson, that women are stronger than men. The valley taught us everything, we didn\u2019t have to go anywhere.\n\nThen when I was 17 I left the valley. But leaving is a thing that is normal with the young. The cottage is like a nest. They grow and they fill it and there are too many of them and then they go off to see the world.\n\nI think it is an instinctual movement, to go out, leave home and see the world, then possibly send money orders back to your mum. When you\u2019ve made it.\n\nAnd I went off one summer\u2019s morning and walked. I\u2019d never seen the sea so I walked south to Southampton, then along the South Coast and up into London and worked on a building site.\n\nThen when that job was over I went to Spain for a year, with my violin. And that was one of the most carefree, happiest times of my life, discovering this almost medieval Spain which in many ways reminded me of home.\n\nIt was all horse traffic in Spain, horses and mules, and I was leaving a village which was all horses and mules and chaps sitting round and gossiping at night, and that sort of community which I\u2019d left still existed.\n\nI went to about 40 countries: the Middle East, Africa and to Mexico. But I knew that I would have to come back here.\n\nAs a child I used to think all the world was like this valley. Born and the eyes open, you immediately register what you see, and I registered this uniquely beautiful valley and I thought this is life, everything\u2019s like this. And I didn\u2019t realise until I\u2019d gone to all these other countries that nothing is like this. When I came back I thought, no I don\u2019t want to go again, I don\u2019t want to move again, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m rooted, I\u2019m back.\n\nThe graveyard is opposite The Woolpack. I drink in the pub and when I go I\u2019ll be taken across the road in a box and put in the churchyard. I\u2019ve found a place halfway up the churchyard, near enough to the church to be aware of, in the spiritual sense, to be conscious of matins, Sunday morning, but also within reach of, in a temporal way, orgies on Saturday nights in The Woolpack.\n\nTo celebrate his 80th birthday, Laurie (pictured) was recorded by TV producer David Parker as they walked around his home village of Slad in Gloucestershire\n\nAnd alternating between the temporal and the spiritual is the way I wish to spend what eternity is left to me.\n\nThis place is called Steanbridge and everybody said that it was named after a squire, Stevens, \u2018Steven\u2019s Bridge\u2019. But I know and my mother knew that\u2019s just pomp, vanity. It\u2019s Stone Bridge, because stone bridges were very unusual. You usually forded a stream. So I think the origin of Steanbridge is \u2018stone bridge\u2019 and I\u2019m going to stick with that.\n\nOn a Saturday morning, you\u2019d hear the jackal cries of the boys and the shrieks of the girls being pursued over the common and down the lanes. It was all part of wildlife and nature.\n\nThe kids don\u2019t come out any more. Now they are all locked up in their little rooms on computers and of course there aren\u2019t as many children as there once were, there are motor cars instead.\n\nUp there is the field where I tumbled with Rosie and that is still the same. We used to meet, the community that is, for village recreations which would be held up in that wood and below the wood in that field.\n\nSwings in the trees, races and games and then a tea in the village hut. Twelve teapots, polished and waiting for us with what we called \u2018fly cake\u2019, piles of fly cake. And this was a treat that would last.\n\nWe only ate sweets once a week. One sweet that my sister brought home. Not one every five minutes.\n\nHere I go again complaining about the young. I would relish just one day of life\u2019s sensuous extravaganza that kids are allowed now to indulge in.\n\nI think by the time they are 12 or 15 they are past it. They are exhausted. No wonder they want to relax in their room with their computer. They are probably writing their memoirs by the time they are 11 or 12 and saying: \u2018If I had my time over again.\u2019\n\nDown In The Valley by Laurie Lee is published by Penguin Classics on November 7, \u00a312.99. \u00a9 Laurie Lee.
