Paramount Pictures 2/37 Ed Harris It's been rumoured for decades that Ed Harris punched James Cameron in the face while filming the watery 1989 drama The Abyss, but here's reportedly why: Cameron failed to tell Harris that his oxygen tank would run out before cameras stopped rolling on a particular scene, leaving the actor gasping for air. 20th Century Fox 3/37 Martin Sheen At the time of filming Apocalypse Now in 1979, Martin Sheen was drinking heavily and using drugs - so much so that, unbeknownst to the crew or his director Francis Ford Coppola, he had a heart attack in the middle of the jungle. Sheen was forced to crawl for approximately half a mile before finding somebody who could treat him. United Artists 4/37 Jackie Chan Jackie Chan is famous for many things and performing his own stunts is one of them. This has left him with his fair share of injuries in the past, some of which came on the set of 1986 action comedy Armour of God. The actor, attempting to slide down a tree, fractured his skull after falling 25 feet and hitting his head on a rock. Chan was immediately rushed into surgery and, to this day, he has a hole in his skull that he covers with a plastic plug. Golden Harvest 5/37 Michael J Fox Michael J Fox famously came close to dying on the set of Back to the Future Part III in 1990. It was during a scene in which his character, Marty McFly, is hanged by the neck - something the crew permitted Fox to act out himself on the condition that he knew exactly where to place his hand when the noose was around his neck. Fox miscalculated, choking himself before passing out and was cut down after someone realised the actor was close to death. Universal Pictures 6/37 The kids in The Brady Bunch While filming a 1973 episode of The Brady Bunch titled \"The Cincinnati Kids\", the child stars of the hit TV show reportedly almost got caught up in a horrendous incident. As they were about to shoot a scene riding a rollercoaster - fit with a camera mounted to the front of the carriage - Mike Brady actor Robert Reed insisted crew carry out a test run.

Paramount Domestic Television 7/37 Aaron Paul Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul cheated death while filming the first season of Breaking Bad in 2008.

Lionsgate 15/37 Daniel Day-Lewis Daniel Day-Lewis went into full \"method actor\" mode for his role as Buffalo Bill in Martin Scorsese's 2002 period drama Gangs of New York - so much so that he contracted pneumonia after refusing to wear clothes that didn't exist in the 19th century. In fact, he was so dedicated to the role that he reportedly refused medicine that didn't exist at the time of his character, but acquiesced when he was told by medics he could die if he didn't. Miramax Films 16/37 Bob Denver Bob Denver, who played the titular Gilligan on 1960s TV series Gilligan\u2019s Island, found himself in mortal danger after getting trapped inside a hut with a lion that pounced on him.

Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures 22/37 Matthew Fox While filming the last ever episode of Lost in 2010, Matthew Fox - who played Jack Shephard - was almost stabbed by a knife after a retractable one was replaced by a real one.

Somehow, the knives weren't swapped and Fox was saved by protective padding he'd put on at the very last minute. Buena Vista Television 23/37 Dylan O'Brien Dylan O'Brien nearly met his maker on the set of Maze Runner: The Death Cure.

After a crew member forgot to apply the brakes to an unmanned van, the vehicle started rolling towards Thurman, who was completely unaware. Thankfully, her co-star Pierce Brosnan spotted it and jumped into the vehicle, slamming the brakes before it hit her. Those 007 skills certainly came in handy. 20th Century Fox 28/37 Jackie Chan As ever, Jackie Chan performed his own stunts for the first of his popular Hong King action series Police Story (1985).
