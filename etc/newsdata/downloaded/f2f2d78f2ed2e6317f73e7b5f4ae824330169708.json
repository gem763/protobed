So he came off the drug in 2017 - but his hands and feet to peel uncontrollably\n\nThe magician holds up a deck of cards after performing to UK rappers Krept and Konan at an event\n\nHe had been prescribed a steroid cream called cyclosporine, which kept his condition at bay for years but was taxing on his liver.\n\nAlthough the lotion helped at first, Mr Cunnew was baffled as to why it became less effective over time.\n\nSo he came off the drug in 2017 - but his hands and feet began to peel uncontrollably and become so dry he couldn\u2019t walk.\n\nHis scalp also broke out in sores, leaving him struggling to sleep and reluctant to be seen in public.\n\nDoctors believe he had developed topical steroid withdrawal - a rare reaction relating to the use of a topical steroid after it has been discontinued.\n\nThey recommended Mr Cunnew sign up for a trial of the drug tralokinumab through the NHS. He claims his symptoms have completely vanished.\n\nThe magician, who runs an air conditioning installations and service work company during the week, also started taking probiotics after researching their benefits.\n\nHe said: 'When I was really young in primary school, I always suffered from eczema, I was in and out the doctors and they\u2019d give me steroid creams constantly.\n\nMr Cunnew signed up for a new trial of the drug tralokinumab through the NHS and clims his symptoms have completely vanished (before, left, and after, right)\n\n'I tried honey, tried herbal teas, I tried everything and nothing really took it down. I was just managing it my whole life and just living with it.\n\n'As I got older it started to go down and then it started to come up again and I took steroid creams for a long time.'\n\nMr Cunnew was prescribed cyclosporine in secondary school and it dramatically reduced his symptoms.\n\nWHAT IS TOPICAL STEROID ADDICTION? Topical steroid addiction arises from the use of such creams to treat conditions like eczema. It occurs when steroids have been discontinued after a prolonged or inappropriate length of administration. Topical steroid addiction has not been reported with correct drug use. Symptoms include: Redness, particularly on the face, genitals and area where the steroids were applied\n\nThickened skin\n\nBurning or stinging\n\nDryness\n\nSkin sensitivity and intolerance to moisturisers Excessive sweating and itching is a sign of recovery. Many sufferers also develop insomnia. Treatment focuses on anxiety support, sleep aids, itch management, infection prevention and immunosuppressants. Doctors should advise patients to avoid long term or high dose steroid use.

At one point, my feet were all peeling, stinging, so dry and I couldn\u2019t walk.\n\n'My hands, all over my body, my head all flared up, my forehead and my scalp. I was having sleepless nights for ages due to coming off this drug. It was bad.\n\n'I was off work for two or three weeks and couldn\u2019t pick things up. My family had to look after me and help me get by day by day. It affected my confidence and work.\n\n'I\u2019ve always learnt to live with it and manage it. The steroid cream only helped me for so much\u2026 It's not good for my skin either and I try not to use it as much.\n\n'It\u2019s a lose-lose situation. I\u2019ve had it all my life, but only two years ago, when I was agreed to come on this new trial, through NHS, tralokinumab, which is when I finally saw a difference.'\n\nTralokinumab is thought to treat eczema by neutralising the production of the protein IL-13, which is overproduced in people with the skin condition.\n\nMr Cunnew also rethought his diet after researching online.\n\nHe added: 'I also did a lot of research on diets and started taking probiotics, I now take Wicked Gummy Co\u2019s Happy Tummy and Wicked Gummy Co\u2019s biotin and folic acid-based Hair, Skin and Nails\u2019 and slowly noticed a big difference.\n\n'I now take injections at home and take my probiotics. It\u2019s still a journey but I\u2019ve become a lot more confident.\n\n'Over the course of the last six weeks, my life has returned totally back to normal. I\u2019m happy and even dating again.'", "description": "Ryan Cunnew, 26, from Surrey, struggled socially and found it impossible to forge a love life due to the skin condition which caused his skin to peel and break out in red raw sores.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/14/20179952-0-image-a-15_1572008511022.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
