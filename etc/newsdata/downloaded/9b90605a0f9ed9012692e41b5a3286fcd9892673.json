The news was first reported by CNN, which is co-hosting the debate in Ohio along with The New York Times.\n\nTwelve candidates have qualified for the October debate so far: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Kalama Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang. Gabbard and Steyer missed out on the September debates but met the polling criteria for the October edition in recent weeks.\n\nNo other candidate appears likely to qualify before the deadline closes. Candidates must get 2 percent support in four DNC-approved polls, as well as donations from 130,000 unique donors, in order to make the debate stage.\n\nAfter the October debate, the thresholds will rise slightly, as the DNC bumped up the criteria to qualify for the November debate. The higher thresholds will imperil some of the candidates in the October debate, but aren't expected to overwhelmingly reduce the number of participating candidates.", "description": "A DNC spokesperson told POLITICO that all candidates will participate in one debate that evening.", "authors": ["Zach Montellaro"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/91/50/7b3e6a5e4faa9e982ac825d9fbcf/190927-debate-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
