Because when you have a gun to your head, you don\u2019t have any other choice but to retaliate,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the line of fire are civilian aircraft from Britain, France, Germany and Spain \u2014 the countries that formed Airbus \u2014 which face an additional 10 percent tax when imported to the US.\n\nBut the tariffs also target consumer products, including goods such as French wine, which Trump had vowed to attack in recent months, wine from Spain and Germany and cheese from Britain.\n\nThe tariffs kicked in after the World Trade Organization gave formal approval earlier this month.\n\nThe Europeans advocate negotiation over conflict and expect the WTO next year will authorize the EU to retaliate against the United States in a parallel case over subsidies for Airbus\u2019 American competitor Boeing.\n\nBrussels in July offered to call a truce on subsidies for the aviation companies, in which both sides would admit fault and agree to curtail state aid \u2014 to no avail.\n\nAs recently as Wednesday, Trump singled out the Europeans for being unfair with the United States on trade but said his door was open for talks.\n\nThe US Trade Representative\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment but White House trade advisor Peter Navarro laid the blame on the EU.\n\n\u201cThe Airbus tariffs was a result of more than a decade-long suit that President Trump brought to fruition in Trump time,\u201d Navarro said on Fox Business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to get Airbus to stop subsidizing so we can have our own air industry here,\u201d Navarro said on Fox Business.\n\nAnd, he cautioned, \u201cthey can\u2019t retaliate under the rules of the World Trade Organization.\u201d\n\nLe Maire was clear that the EU would not retaliate in the Boeing case until the WTO makes a final ruling next year.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Very hard\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe Europeans fear above all that Trump will impose heavy duties on imports of European cars around mid-November.\n\nThis would be a serious blow for the German automotive sector in particular, even if giants such as Volkswagen or BMW also manufacture in the United States.\n\n\u201cOur products are very hard to bring in (to Europe)\u201d when Europeans easily import their cars into the United States, Trump said.\n\nThe Airbus-Boeing disputes is just one of several issues stoking transatlantic tensions that quickly descended into acrimony when Trump took office in 2017.\n\nTrump embraced a protectionist agenda, slapping import duties on steel and aluminum from the EU and other allies, while also threatening tariffs on cars.\n\nThe US leader and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed in July 2018 to a ceasefire in the conflict to hold trade talks that have so far led nowhere.\n\nThe epic legal battle between Airbus and Boeing at the World Trade Organization began in 2004 when Washington accused Britain, France, Germany and Spain of providing illegal subsidies and grants to support the production of a range of Airbus products.\n\nA year later, the EU alleged that Boeing had received $19.1 billion worth of prohibited subsidies from 1989 to 2006 from various branches of the US government.\n\nThe two cases were then tangled up in a legal quagmire, with each side being given partial vindication after a long series of appeals and counter appeals.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Hours after the United States imposed tariffs on a record $7.5-billion worth of European Union goods on Friday in a dispute over", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/aaa90f_epic-legal-battle-airbus-boeing-world-trade-organization-began-in-2004-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
