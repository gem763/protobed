Bolton once derided Giuliani\u2019s work as a \u201cdrug deal\u201d and said he wanted no part of it, according to previous testimony.\n\nThe Democrats are also calling John Eisenberg, the lawyer for the NSC who fielded an Army officer\u2019s concerns over Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukraine president, and Michel Ellis, another security council official, according to a person familiar with the invitation and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\nThe rush of possible new witnesses comes as the House prepares to take its first official vote Thursday on the process ahead. That includes public hearings in a matter of weeks and the possibility of drafting articles of impeachment against the president.\n\nThe White House has urged officials not to testify in the impeachment proceedings, and it\u2019s not guaranteed that those called will appear for depositions, even if they receive subpoenas as previous witnesses have.\n\nBolton\u2019s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, has filed a lawsuit in federal court asking a judge to resolve the question of whether he can be forced to testify since he was a close and frequent adviser to the president. Any ruling in that case could presumably have an impact on whether Bolton will testify.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies on Capitol Hill say the entire impeachment inquiry is illegitimate and are unpersuaded by the House resolution formally setting out next steps.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the format for the impeachment probe denies Trump the \u201cmost basic rights of due process.\u201d\n\nNow in its second month, the investigation is focused on Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukraine when he asked President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democrats and a potential 2020 political rival, Joe Biden, as the White House was withholding military aid Ukraine relies on for its defenses. Democrats contend Trump was proposing a quid-pro-quo arrangement.\n\nOn Thursday, the investigators are to hear from Tim Morrison, a former top GOP aide on Capitol Hill, who served at Trump\u2019s National Security Council and was among those likely monitoring the president\u2019s call with Ukraine.\n\nLate Wednesday, it was disclosed that Morrison was resigning his White House position. He has been a central figure in other testimony about Trump\u2019s dealing with Ukraine.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Democratic and Republican House lawmakers heard fresh testimony about the Trump administration\u2019s unusual back channels to Ukraine.\n\nTwo State Department Ukraine experts offered new accounts of Trump\u2019s reliance on Giuliani rather than career diplomats to engage with the East European ally, a struggling democracy facing aggression from Russia.\n\nForeign Service officer Christopher Anderson testified that Bolton cautioned him that Giuliani \u201cwas a key voice with the president on Ukraine\u201d and could complicate U.S. goals for the country.\n\nAnother Foreign Service officer, Catherine Croft, said that during her time at Trump\u2019s National Security Council, she received \u201cmultiple\u201d phone calls from lobbyist Robert Livingston \u2014 a former top Republican lawmaker once in line to become House speaker \u2014 telling her the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, should be fired.\n\n\u201cIt was not clear to me at the time \u2014 or now \u2014 at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch,\u201d she said in prepared remarks obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nLivingston characterized Yovanovitch as an \u201c\u2018Obama holdover\u2019 and associated with George Soros,\u201d she said, referring to the American financier who is often the subject of conservative criticism in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nMost Democrats are expected to support the formal impeachment investigation resolution Thursday, even if they don\u2019t back impeachment itself, saying they are in favor of opening the process with more formal procedures.\n\nPublic hearings are expected to begin in mid-November, a matter of weeks. Democrats are eager to hear from some top witnesses who have already provided compelling testimony behind closed doors, including diplomat William Taylor, a top ambassador in Ukraine, and Alexander Vindman, the Army officer who testified Tuesday that he twice reported to superiors, including Eisenberg, his concerns about Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine.\n\nVindman is willing to testify publicly, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity Wednesday to discuss it.\n\nAt Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington, during a fundraiser for House Republicans and lengthy dinner afterward with GOP leaders, the president indicated he was prepared for the fight ahead, said those familiar with the private gatherings Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a tough guy,\u201d said Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the GOP whip.\n\nBoth career diplomats testifying Wednesday had served as top aides to the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, who was the first to testify in the impeachment inquiry and whose cache of text messages provided key insight into Trump\u2019s demands on the new Ukraine president.\n\nCroft, who testified for nearly five hours, described being told at an administration meeting that security funds for Ukraine were being put on hold \u201cat the direction of the president,\u201d corroborating other accounts that have been provided to investigators.\n\nIn his opening statement, Anderson traced his unease with developments that he felt threatened to set back relations between the U.S. and Ukraine.\n\nHe told investigators that senior White House officials blocked an effort by the State Department to release a November 2018 statement condemning Russia\u2019s attack on Ukrainian military vessels.\n\nBoth witnesses were instructed by the administration to not testify but appeared in response to subpoenas from the House, according to a statement from their attorney Mark MacDougall.\n\nThe lawyer told lawmakers that neither of his clients is the whistleblower whose complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry and that he would object to any questions aimed at identifying that person.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Zeke Miller, Padmananda Rama, Matthew Daly and Alan Fram contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 House investigators are summoning former national security adviser John Bolton to testify in their impeachment inquiry, deepening their", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/30/397c19_trump-impeachment-27204-john-bolton-in-31-2019-file-photo-national-security-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
