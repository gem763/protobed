The Federal Statistics Office said seasonally adjusted exports rose 0.7% on the month while imports fell 1.5 %. The trade surplus rose to 20.2 billion euros ($22.27 billion) after a downwardly revised 18.0 billion euros in the prior month. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 0.5% drop in exports and a 0.3% fall in imports. The trade surplus was expected to come in at 17.5 billion euros.\n\nGerman exports unexpectedly rise in July", "description": "German exports unexpectedly rise in July", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF880FA_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
