The painting will remain in its spot, however, and will not be part of the special exhibition.", "description": "Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece had been moved due to renovations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/59/74/1000x563_cmsv2_18f56080-bb9e-547a-81e5-f87a68aa521b-4215974.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
