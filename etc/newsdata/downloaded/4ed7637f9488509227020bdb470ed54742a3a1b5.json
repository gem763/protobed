She pretty much put India on the map in track and field after the Milkha Singh era. Usha narrowly missed out on a bronze in the 1984 Olympics, but there is more to her legacy than that.\n\nAs a child she did not have a good financial position and faced difficulties and this compounded by health problems. But the hallmark of a great athlete is to overcome what life throws at that person, and Usha did just that.\n\nPTI\n\nFirst spotted in 1976, she started building herself as a track and field athlete. The first signs she showed was with 5 medals at the 1978 junior interstate meet of which 4 were gold. In the same year she won 14 medals at the Kerala State College meet. More records followed in the 1979 National Games and 1980 National interstate meet.\n\nPTI\n\nDon't Miss 2.4 K SHARES 145 SHARES 1.1 K SHARES 12.1 K SHARES 15.4 K SHARES\n\nThe 1982 Asian Games saw her win silver in 100m and 200m and that set the tone. In 1984 she finished 4th in the 400m hurdles, narrowly missing out on an Olympic medal. But between 1983 to 1989 she won 13 gold in ATF meets.\n\nBy the time Usha left the track, she had left a legacy of the Queen of the racing track and there is no doubt about it. Current athletes try to live up to her standard which is a pretty high bar.\n\nThe fact that she never won an Olympic medal will hurt but it does not diminish her greatness.", "description": "Anyone who has followed Indian sports over a long period of time will have heard of PT Usha.
