(AP) - A county in south Mississippi has settled a racial profiling lawsuit and its sheriff\u2019s department is setting new policies that limit officers\u2019 use of race or national origin as a reason to stop and question people, attorneys say.\n\nA family with Latino and Native American background filed a federal lawsuit in November against Hancock County, Mississippi.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center and the Mississippi Center for Justice, representing the family, said Wednesday that a settlement was signed last month and that the new anti-profiling policies are part of the settlement.\n\nThe lawsuit says Marcos and Stephanie Martinez of Taylors, South Carolina, their three children, two other relatives and a family friend were on vacation and traveling through Mississippi in June 2017 in the family van when a deputy stopped them on Interstate 10. It says the deputy asked if they were U.S. citizens, confiscated their passports and other documents and demanded to know if they were carrying illegal drugs.\n\nThe lawsuit says Marcos Martinez was obeying all traffic laws when he was stopped, and that he and the others in the van were detained for four hours - two on the side of the interstate and two at the sheriff\u2019s department. It says they underwent \u201cextensive interrogation, threats and multiple unlawful searches because of their perceived race, ethnicity and national origin.\u201d\n\nStephanie Martinez and the couple\u2019s children are U.S. citizens, and she is of Native American descent. Marcos Martinez was born in Mexico, and at the time of the traffic stop, he had legal permanent residency in the United States. He has become a U.S. citizen since.\n\nMarcos Martinez\u2019s mother and sister, who are both from Mexico and were in the U.S. on tourist visas, were in the van. The lawsuit says the family was driving from South Carolina to Mexico to return them home before their visas expired. The friend in the van lives in South Carolina and was traveling with the Martinez family so he could see his own relatives in Mexico.\n\nStephanie Martinez told The Associated Press on Thursday that because of the way the family was treated during the traffic stop, her children no longer trust law enforcement officers. The children are now 10, 13 and 15 years old.\n\n\u201cNow when they see a cop, they automatically think they\u2019re coming for us,\u201d Stephanie Martinez said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to explain to them that they are supposed to call on law enforcement in time of need and they are supposed to trust law enforcement when I don\u2019t trust them myself.\u201d\n\nHancock County Sheriff Ricky Adam did not immediately return a call from AP seeking comment Thursday.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s new policies say race, ethnicity or national origin may play no role in an officer\u2019s decision to stop, detain or question people unless those characteristics are part of a \u201ccredible, timely and specific suspect description\u201d that includes other information such as a suspect\u2019s height or weight. The policies also say officers may not prolong a stop to check a person\u2019s immigration status and that the department must collect information about traffic stops, including the length of the stop, whether it resulted in a citation and the race or ethnicity of the person stopped.\n\nStephanie Martinez said she\u2019s pleased that her family\u2019s lawsuit brought about policy changes.\n\n\u201cI just want people to know that they have rights and they need to know those rights,\u201d she said.\n\nThe settlement includes a $90,000 payment from the county to the plaintiffs, a Southern Poverty Law Center spokesman said.\n\nAttorneys for the Martinez family said that Hancock County said its deputies were acting under a program that promotes cooperation among local and federal law enforcement agencies. However, Gillian Gillers, senior staff attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in a news release that the program does not give local officers the authority to enforce federal immigration laws.\n\n\u201cThis case is a powerful reminder that when local law enforcement tries to do the job of federal immigration agents, they will face costly legal challenges,\u201d Gillers said.\n\n____\n\nFollow Emily Wagster Pettus: http://twitter.com/EWagsterPettus .\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A county in south Mississippi has settled a racial profiling lawsuit and its sheriff's department is setting new policies that limit officers' use of race or national origin as a reason to stop and question people, attorneys say.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Emily Wagster Pettus"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
