As part of a long-running partnership between the organizations, Verizon will sponsor the initiative to provide schools in low-income areas across the United States with free access to The New York Times. The program could serve up to 7 million students.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nThis sponsorship will help the Times more easily access younger readers, who generally choose to consume news outside of news sites, apps, or physical papers. Younger generations have expressed a clear appetite for news and are deeply engaged in social and political issues. That said, they disproportionately consume news in alternative ways: 45% of 18-to 25-year-olds have first contact with news through their smartphones every morning, per Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.\n\nAdditionally, the majority (57%) of 18-to 25-year-olds go to social media and messaging apps first for news each morning, versus just 29% for those over 35. Given their digital savviness, this behavior is likely even more prevalent among current high schoolers. By making itself free to millions of low-income high schoolers, the Times could encourage more intentional readership among a group that otherwise prefers the aggregated experience provided by social over the uniformity of a single news destination. At the very least, readers in this group will not be turned away by a paywall should they access a Times article from a social or messaging app.\n\nThe socially responsible nature of the initiative could also boost the Times' brand in general, but especially among younger generations. The schools set to receive free access to the publication are predominantly in rural and low-income areas, and the companies are planning to be responsible so far as advertising displays. While there will be some kind of corporate branding representing that Verizon is a part of the partnership, on school computers, there will be no display advertising, and NYT won't collect user data through this program.\n\nThis should appeal to younger users, both those opting into school-funded subscriptions and not: Gen Z has been found to distrust brands overall, and to particularly lack interest in those that neglect social issues. However, brands that do express their concern for and interest in such issues can be rewarded: 58% of GenZers said that an association with a social cause \u2014 like providing educational tools to underserved youth, for example \u2014 could spur a purchase, per a study from DoSomething Strategic.\n\nThis project could hit the nail on the head when it comes to these ideals, as it could allow The New York Times to earn goodwill that could translate to near-term subs from those outside of the free-sub initiative along with long-term loyalty from those within.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
