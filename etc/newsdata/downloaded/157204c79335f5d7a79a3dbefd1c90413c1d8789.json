I can sit and cry all night, which I\u2019ve done many times.\n\n\u201cMy last attack was yesterday. I didn\u2019t want to get out of bed and I had\n\npress interviews to do. I tried to cancel them, but my assistant said: \u2018Merrill, remember what you have to do in these cases\u2019. So I was able to talk to myself. It took me about an hour and it wasn\u2019t easy, but I got through it.\n\n(Image: DAILY MIRROR)\n\n\u201cI go into a very scary state where I lose perspective. I lose hope, my hands start shaking and I\u2019m not thinking straight \u2013 my mind is scrambling. I\u2019m out of control.\n\n\u201cAt my worst I can\u2019t speak to people. I want to be by myself. It\u2019s not a pretty sight. You don\u2019t want to be around me, but with medication I\u2019m able to experience a little bit of normality.\u201d\n\nRecalling the day he came close to suicide, Merrill says: \u201cI had a knife and I didn\u2019t want to live because I had no hope. It was a Buck Knife that was in the house. I picked it up and walked out.\n\n\u201cIt was a spur of the moment thing and I climbed up to the top of a \u00admountain near my home in Utah. I couldn\u2019t see any light and the feelings of not wanting to live were so prevalent in my mind, there was just darkness.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that stopped me taking my life was a miraculous wind that came out of nowhere and almost blew me over. I realised there was \u00adsomething going on that was bigger than me and it startled me to the point where I put the knife down and decided I was going to face my feelings head on.\u201d\n\nMerrill was 16 at the time. Already a huge success on American television with his brothers \u2013 but not yet a musical sensation \u2013 he didn\u2019t mention the episode to any of them. \u201cBack then depression wasn\u2019t really focused on,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople hardly spoke about it, so it took a while to process what was going on and I kept quiet.\u201d\n\nA few weeks later he visited a doctor friend who took him to a psychologist who confirmed he was suffering from anxiety and depression. Today he thinks it may have been caused by a \u00adcombination of genetics \u2013 his father George was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and Merrill\u2019s siblings Donny and Marie have both experienced depression \u2013 and his unconventional upbringing.\n\n(Image: Bettmann Archive)\n\n\u201cMy childhood was run like I was in the military and I was always in the spotlight,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore all the fame, as a really young child, I was extremely happy-go-lucky and very mellow. But when I was four we knew we needed to start working really hard. Our Dad was a \u00admilitary sergeant and my brain started to churn with it all.\n\n\u201cThe anxiety started when I was about 10 and by 16 depression had really set in. Even though the fame and the popularity was all going on and it was an exciting time, I saw no hope.\u201d\n\nThe Osmonds\u2019 career began in 1958. Despite their young ages (Alan was nine, Wayne was seven, Merrill, five and Jay, three), their father took them to auditions and they were quickly spotted by singer Andy Williams who put them on his hit US television show.\n\nIn 1971, when Merrill was 18, they landed a record contract and had their first No 1 hit, One Bad Apple. In the early 1970s they were the biggest pop band in the world, yet Merrill\u2019s as yet undiagnosed bipolar disorder was clearly affecting him. The condition is\n\ncharacterised by severe mood swings, ranging from extreme lows (depression) to extreme highs (mania). The manic phase often includes feeling elated, full of energy and new ideas, and not wanting to sleep.\n\n\u201cI would create songs, I would write new symphonic tunes, I would stay up for days and days writing a pageant,\u201d says Merrill, who co-wrote the group\u2019s biggest hits \u2013 including Crazy Horses and Let Me In \u2013 during the period.\n\n\u201cThere were moments when I would be manic and had it not been for that I would never have accomplished half of the things I did, but after it was all over, I would crash and nobody could help me through that.\u201d\n\nAfter he was diagnosed, Merrill was told that his \u00adserotonin levels were almost zero. He was prescribed Lamotrigine, a mood stabiliser, yet he still experiences bouts of depression almost weekly and anxiety on a daily basis.\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\nOver the years he has tried \u00adtestosterone treatment and countless talking therapies, including CBT, \u00admindfulness and meditation. He currently has counselling once a month, but has created his own personal way of coping.\n\n\u201cWhat works best for me is talking internally to myself,\u201d he explains. \u201cI know how to shut down the engine. I know how to go to each part of my body and talk to it and slow it down. I know that might sound crazy, but I\u2019ve had to go inside myself to conquer what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nIn December he will be performing a string of concerts in Britain and believes that on stage is where he finds the greatest peace. \u201cBeing in the moment and letting the audience help to create the environment for me, so it becomes like a party atmosphere,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cThen, after it\u2019s all over, you start thinking worst-case scenarios, doom and gloom. But these days I don\u2019t look for the magical pill. I try to understand it and I can process it a lot better than when I was young.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful my mind has been able to help me create masterpieces. If people who have what I have can look at it that way, just think about the creativity that could be introduced to the world.\u201d\n\n* Merrill is touring the UK in December.
