Show Hide Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who \u201chave failed us\u201d, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India.

On Sunday one woman and two men were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause public nuisance. The woman has been released under investigation but the men remain in custody, the police said.\n\nAmong those arrested on Monday on Victoria Embankment, outside the Ministry of Defence, was 81-year-old Sarah Lasenby, a Quaker and retired social worker from Oxford. She said: \u201cFor 21 years my main concern has been to help get rid of UK nuclear weapons. I am still keen to do this but once I came across XR I was so relieved to have something I could do about the ghastly state we have got our planet in.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Activists gesture in front of police officers during the Extinction Rebellion protest in London.

The need is so strong; what can be more important than the future of all life in this planet? Action must be taken to have a chance of mitigating the effects of the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nPolice officers, including from the territorial support group, had earlier swarmed on to the streets of Westminster in an attempt to forestall the latest action by Extinction Rebellion.\n\nThey lined the streets, stopping and searching people on Whitehall and outside the underground station, particularly casually dressed people and those with rucksacks or bags.\n\nThe heavy police presence comes after Extinction Rebellion shut down central London for two weeks in April.\n\nVenetia said: \u201cIt\u2019s testament to the way they think we are an effective force that they think they have to intervene at that level. They\u2019re pushing the boundaries of the law. I don\u2019t blame individual officers but there\u2019s a policy not to allow this kind of protest. But we still have a right to peaceful protest.\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion said the protests were expected to be five times the size of those in April.", "description": "Climate crisis activists intend to target 12 areas in central London over next two weeks", "authors": ["Haroon Siddique"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bafe1a36b820791c1c48628ed0269440dc8af5ea/0_217_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6947b9025d9cb8967d19f63b185d6809", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
