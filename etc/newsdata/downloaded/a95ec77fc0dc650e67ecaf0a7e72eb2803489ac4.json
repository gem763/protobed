Photo-Illustration: by Stevie Remsberg; Photos: Getty\n\nDoing the Most \ufeffis a special series about ambition \u2014 how we define it, harness it, and conquer it.\n\nFor many women, the window of career opportunity seems to get narrower and narrower with age. And while dewy teen ingenues may look like they have it made, the reality is that plenty of famous women achieve success way after their teens, 20s, or even 50s. Below, 25 women including Ava DuVernay, Iris Apfel, and Vera Wang discuss the benefits of being a late bloomer in their careers.\n\n1) Leslie Jones\n\n\u201cI remember some nights where I was, like, All right, this comedy shit just ain\u2019t working out. And not just when I was 25. Like, when I was 45 \u2026 I\u2019m glad this whole success thing is happening now. I can\u2019t even imagine a 23-year-old Leslie in this position. They would have kicked me off the set [of Ghostbusters] after two days. I would have fucked half the dudes in the crew. I was a less confident person back then. And damn sure not as funny.\u201d \u2014 The New Yorker, January 2016\n\n2) Viola Davis\n\n\u201c[For years,] I was trying to fit in, stifling my voice, stifling who I was, in order to be seen as pretty, in order for people to like me. And then going home, not being able to sleep and having anxiety. I have found that the labelling of me, and having to fit into that box, has cost me a great deal. I\u2019ve had a lot of lost years \u2026 [but] I feel like my past has been the perfect foundation to teach me everything about this business and about life \u2026 I know what it\u2019s like not to have food. I know what it means to even have half of my refrigerator full, or not to have electricity and hot water, to have a job and a paycheck. It was ripe ground to study human behaviour. Everyone knew who the town drunk was, who was beating their wife, everyone knew everyone\u2019s mess. So that\u2019s helped me greatly, informing my work.\u201d \u2014 The Guardian, October 2018\n\n3) Sheryl Crow\n\n\u201cI would safely say that I\u2019ve been relatively untouched by my success, because I got a late start. I wasn\u2019t successful at the age of 5 with people trying to get at me and surrounding my limousine. My situation was much, much different. And I can safely say that I enjoy a certain amount of anonymity.\u201d \u2014 NPR, July 2014\n\n4) Tiffany Haddish\n\n\u201cPeople been telling me that for years, like, \u2018Your turn is coming, you\u2019re about to blow up.\u2019 But now that billboards are all over the city and stuff, it\u2019s so funny because all those guys that I used to date that were like, \u2018I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re wasting your time with this comedy stuff. It\u2019s never going to pan out. You just need to have a baby,\u2019 now they\u2019re all like, \u2018Hey girl. I\u2019m so proud of you. I knew you would make it.\u2019 I just laugh at them.\u201d \u2013 Indiewire, July 2017\n\n5) Iris Apfel\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been well known in my field but since the first show [in 2005, at The Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute], it\u2019s gotten insane. I\u2019m very grateful at my stage of the game to have all this happen. It makes me laugh and laugh; it\u2019s ridiculous, because underneath, I\u2019m the same person I\u2019ve always been.\u201d \u2013 The Telegraph, October 2011\n\n6) Rosamund Pike\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely at an exciting time, with the ability to headline some films. The film I\u2019m about to start working on, that\u2019s really on my shoulders, and that\u2019s a new feeling. The relief is that I think I\u2019m ready for that now. I wouldn\u2019t have been in my 20s \u2026 I\u2019ve become free. I don\u2019t give a shit. I\u2019ve lost my vanity. I don\u2019t care, really! I just don\u2019t care. Once you\u2019ve shed the pressure of being a young woman, you\u2019re allowed to just be a woman. It\u2019s freeing.\u201d \u2014 Vulture, December 2017\n\n7) Edie Falco\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the same person who, 15 years ago, couldn\u2019t get an audition \u2026 That\u2019s what I worry about when kids get success early on \u2026 When they start to assume: This must be because I really am hot stuff. When, in fact, they haven\u2019t put in the time, they don\u2019t recognize themselves as just another struggling actor. If success comes early, it can mess with you. As rough as my early days were, I wouldn\u2019t change five seconds. I\u2019m always grateful to work.\u201d \u2014 The New York Times, December 2015\n\n8) Constance Wu\n\n\u201cWhy is the \u2018It\u2019 girl even a thing? I always played younger, and sometimes people, once they found out I was older, would be like, Oh. Knowing I was older and not so fresh to the game diminished my value in their eyes. And that has absolutely no basis, because usually somebody who\u2019s older is way more valuable, especially on a set and in terms of being an actor and having more life experiences from which to draw.\u201d \u2014 Vulture, June 2016\n\n9) Ali Wong\n\n\u201cI got the crazy out of the way \u2026 [In my 20s] I was definitely a drinker \u2014 like 40 ounces of malt liquor. I could do probably two of those \u2026 At the time, I didn\u2019t know any better, and I thought it was delicious, or I made myself think it was delicious. And then you grow old. Then you become a responsible adult, and you\u2019re like, Oh, I was drinking pee \u2026 [My daughters] came into my life after Baby Cobra, so they don\u2019t know my journey to get where I am \u2014 what made me who I am.\u201d \u2014 Vanity Fair, April 2019\n\n10) Vera Wang\n\nOn starting her business at 40: \u201cIs [40] old? Perhaps I would have preferred to start off at 20 or 30, but I don\u2019t think I would have been anywhere near equipped to know what it takes to be in business. Even at 40, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure I should be doing it. It wasn\u2019t an era for start-ups. I\u2019d always felt I should learn and earn, and I\u2019d already had two incredible careers working for others \u2014 at Cond\u00e9 Nast and then Ralph Lauren \u2014 the best in the industry. Still, I didn\u2019t feel very qualified or secure. I never thought I deserved to found a company \u2026 To think I could start, and run, and sustain a business? I knew how hard it was. My father was the reason I did it. When I got engaged, at 39, I was a little beyond the age of most brides and on a quest for a dress. I looked everywhere, from department stores to Chanel couture. My father identified that as an opportunity. He didn\u2019t work in the garment industry, but he was a businessman, and he saw that bridal came with lower risks: It had low inventory, few fabrics at that time, and, since people will always want to get married, a steady stream of customers, though they don\u2019t usually repeat. I didn\u2019t know anything about dress design. I didn\u2019t feel ready. And when I left Ralph, a lot of doors that had been open to me slammed shut, whether it was a fabric manufacturer or a party I wanted to go to, because I was now so small. Harsh. But my DNA was to find something I felt passionate about, to make a difference, and to work, so that\u2019s what I did.\u201d \u2014 Harvard Business Review, July/August 2019\n\n11) Lizzo\n\n\u201cIf I was 19 right now, I would be f\u2014ing terrified. But I\u2019m older, I\u2019m wiser, I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m getting actualized. I genuinely care about living a quality life, and if y\u2019all gonna look up to that, then that\u2019s cool! I want people to be happier. I\u2019ve seen how sick the world is, I\u2019ve seen how sad people can be \u2014 I\u2019ve been that person \u2014 and I genuinely want to use my gifts and the talents that I was blessed with to make sure that shit is even a fraction less sad than it is now.\u201d \u2014 Entertainment Weekly, April 2019\n\n12) Jessica Chastain\n\n\u201cI spent four years in Los Angeles before I ever got a film audition. And in that time I created my own curriculum. I would go to movement class every day. I found a donation-based yoga studio because I had no money and did yoga every day. I would go to the public library and research plays \u2026 If you don\u2019t show up prepared, that\u2019s it. This isn\u2019t the kind of business where if you mess up many times they\u2019ll still cast you. If you do something every single day that makes you an actor, you are an actor.\u201d \u2014 Backstage, March 2017\n\n13) Ava DuVernay\n\n\u201cWhen people tell [my story], it\u2019s about race and gender, \u2018Black woman director,\u2019 but my story\u2019s also really about age, because I didn\u2019t pick up a camera until I was 32. That\u2019s older in filmmaking years, like dog years. In comparison, Ryan Coogler is 31, and he\u2019s on his third film \u2026 For me to pick up a camera as a black woman who did not go to film school \u2014 this is a testament to whatever path you\u2019re on right now is not necessarily the path you have to stay on. If you\u2019re on a path that\u2019s not the one that you want to be on, you can also pivot, and you can also move, and age doesn\u2019t make a difference, race, gender. It\u2019s about putting one step in front of another, about forward movement to where you wanna be.\u201d \u2014 Refinery29, March 2018\n\n14) Toni Morrison\n\nOn recognizing that she had a gift for writing: \u201cIt was very late. I always thought I was probably adept, because people used to say so, but their criteria might not have been mine. So, I wasn\u2019t interested in what they said. It meant nothing. It was by the time I was writing Song of Solomon, the third book, that I began to think that this was the central part of my life \u2026 It\u2019s almost as if you needed permission to write. When I read women\u2019s biographies and autobiographies, even accounts of how they got started writing, almost every one of them had a little anecdote that told about the moment someone gave them permission to do it. A mother, a husband, a teacher \u2014 somebody \u2014 said, OK, go ahead \u2014 you can do it.\u201d \u2014 The Paris Review, fall 1993\n\n15) J.K. Rowling\n\n\u201cWhy do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena I believed I truly belonged. I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realised, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.\u201d \u2013 Harvard Commencement Speech, June 2008\n\n16) Marina Abramovic\n\n\u201cArtists should never think of themselves as an idol. Fame is a side effect of one\u2019s work. I\u2019ve put 40 years into this. Some young artists who are 25 [and become famous] overdose and die, but my success came so slow. So it does not really affect my ego because ego is a huge obstacle in art. If you think you\u2019re great, then something is seriously wrong with you.\u201d \u2014 Harper\u2019s Bazaar, February 2012\n\n17) Sia\n\nOn refusing to show her face during public appearances: \u201cPeople say, \u2018Enough of this shit where she doesn\u2019t show her face,\u2019 and \u2018It\u2019s a gimmick.\u2019 For sure. I\u2019m trying to do this differently, for serenity. And it\u2019s a fun game for me as well. I have nothing to lose. But of course I want to be loved. So when people say, \u2018Show your face, you\u2019re not ugly.\u2019 I want to say, \u2018I know. I\u2019m not doing it because I think I\u2019m ugly; I\u2019m trying to have some control over my image. And I\u2019m allowed to maintain some modicum of privacy. But also I would like not to be picked apart or for people to observe when I put on ten pounds or take off ten pounds or I have a hair extension out of place or my fake tan is botched.\u2019 I\u2019m just trying to work out a way to be a singer and to create cool content. I\u2019m willing to do that as an entertainer. But I\u2019m not willing to give up my actual self \u2026 I\u2019m 39, and I would like to be able to make great pop music for another 20 years. And it feels like creating a sort of inanimate blond bob and allowing other people to play the role of the pop singer, it affords me a little bit more freedom in terms of my expiration date.\u201d \u2014 Interview, March 2015\n\n18) Tracee Ellis Ross\n\n\u201cI do feel like so many doors are open to me now. And it started for me in my 40s \u2026 I\u2019m really grateful I have a mom [Diana Ross] who\u2019s 75 and her face looks like a woman who swallowed the sun. She\u2019s gorgeous, sexy, and full of agency. So that\u2019s what I long to walk toward.\u201d \u2014 Variety, June 2019\n\n19) Kris Jenner\n\n\u201cI had always had the energy and motivation and passion to pursue all these dreams, but it took a show like Keeping Up with the Kardashians to be the vehicle that could channel all my energies and turn them into viable opportunities. I started to look at our careers like pieces on a chessboard. Every day, I woke up and walked into my office and asked myself, What move do you need to make today? It was very calculated. My business decisions and strategies were very intentional, definite, and planned to the nth degree.\u201d \u2013 Kris Jenner \u2026 and All Things Kardashian, November 2011\n\n20) Cheryl Strayed\n\n\u201c\u201dI\u2019ve spent my whole, I mean my whole adult life, really working on this thing: becoming a writer, becoming the sort of writer who would find an audience \u2026 I never set my sights on fame or being on the bestseller list or any of those things because all of you in the room who are writers or artists of any sort know that that sort of external recognition is not the measure by which artists can measure their success. The way we measure success, and often for artists what looks like failure is often success and that it takes a long time to develop that craft and to do anything as simple as write a really bad book, you know. I mean truly, it\u2019s really hard even to write a really bad book. Trust me, I know. But I think that this fame thing, it feels in some ways, thankfully, very much separate from the work I\u2019ve been doing all these years as a writer. My job was to write the best book I could ever write at that moment of my life, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done with each of my three books, and then the thing that happens to it in the world is really outside of me.\u201d \u2014 NYPL, January 2015\n\n21) Octavia Spencer\n\n\u201cMaking The Help and getting my first Oscar nomination was wonderful. It felt special to all of us women who worked on it \u2026 Finding fame in my 40s allowed me an adult perspective on my career. I truly understood that you have to enjoy it \u2014 and appreciate it.\u201d \u2014 The Guardian, February 2018\n\n22) Jane Lynch\n\n\u201cI was 40 by the time I started making money at this \u2026 and I was happy before that \u2026 If you\u2019ve got some goal that you think you need to be somewhere by the time you\u2019re some age, that\u2019s so stupid. Don\u2019t do it. I never had that goal.\u201d \u2014 CNBC, July 2017\n\n23) Kathy Bates\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a stunning woman. I never was an ingenue; I\u2019ve always just been a character actor. When I was younger it was a real problem, because I was never pretty enough for the roles that other young women were being cast in. The roles I was lucky enough to get were real stretches for me: usually a character who was older, or a little weird, or whatever. And it was hard, not just for the lack of work but because you have to face up to how people are looking at you.\u201d \u2014 The New York Times, January 1991\n\n24) Ina Garten\n\n\u201cI was 50 years old and I thought the best years of my career were over. [Barefoot Contessa, the store] wasn\u2019t stimulating to me and I tried to figure out what to do next. Type A people think they can figure out what to do next while they\u2019re doing something, and they can\u2019t. An important part of changing and figuring out what to do next is you have to just stop. I had to get good and bored before I could decide what was next \u2014 I thought maybe I\u2019ll write a cookbook [The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook] while I figure it out.\u201d \u2014 Forbes, June 2015\n\n25) Kerry Washington\n\n\u201cFor me, 40 feels like a beginning. I\u2019m in the middle of so much new \u2014 with this career, the kids, and I\u2019m still sort of a newlywed. I\u2019m excited to be at this stage in life.\u201d \u2014 Glamour, May 2017\n\nStay in touch.
