I\u2019ve been here seven years, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met him. I may have walked by him running around doing something at \u2018Mania.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He\u2019s coming to be a part of the show, he\u2019s probably the biggest icon on the face of the earth right now. For him to find time to part of this shows how big it really is!\u2019\n\nWhile the big-time Hollywood actor would deliver some scathing put-downs on-screen before hitting Corbin with his signature moves \u2013 the People\u2019s Elbow and Rock Bottom \u2013 he has gone on to heap praise on the WWE\u2019s current premiere bad guy on social media, telling him he has a \u2018lot of talent and potential\u2019 while thanking him for the work they did together in the ring.\n\nFans are used to seeing the star \u2013 who went by Baron Corbin before adopting his royal moniker after winning this year\u2019s King of the Ring tournament \u2013 as the ultimate bad guy, the kind of man who reveled in the moment a small child was so angry he beat Kurt Angle in the Hall of Famer\u2019s last ever match at WrestleMania 35 earlier this year that they \u2018gave him the finger\u2019.\n\nCorbin, Becky and Rock in the ring (Picture: WWE)\n\nKing Corbin is grateful to Triple H (Picture: WWE)\n\nBut there\u2019s another side to the former Raw constable and acting general manager, and all round thorn in the side of the WWE\u2019s heroes \u2013 and it\u2019s a lighthearted one that viewers watching at home or at the arenas and stadiums around the world rarely see.\n\nThe ex-NFL sportsman told us how he once pranked fellow villain Lacey Evans by sneaking some Gummy Bears into her hand during a live show, meaning she had to keep her fist closed for the rest of the match.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She was eating them backstage, these Gummy Bears. So I handed her them and she couldn\u2019t do anything,\u2019 he laughed.\n\nAt this year\u2019s Hall of Fame ceremony, fans got a glimpse of his playful side when he got caught in the crossfire as his boss Paul \u2018Triple H\u2019 Levesque chased him down with a water gun in the crown.\n\n\u2018It was cool because I remember, I was just watching it and for some reason, I caught Hunter\u2019s eye, he looked at me and it\u2019s like, this is going to go badly for me,\u2019 he joked.\n\n\u2018And he just started chasing me \u2013 it\u2019s cool, it\u2019s another thing that\u2019s a testament for their love for this. I wouldn\u2019t be anywhere without Triple H.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s the same kind of relationship he shares with WWE\u2019s owner Vince McMahon, and Corbin admitted it\u2019s very important to know when it\u2019s appropriate to joke around and when he needs to get down to work.\n\nHe added: \u2018I have a fantastic relationship with Vince. There\u2019s been a couple of times where he\u2019s tried to knock me out of chairs or knock me over and run off \u2013 I know when I can do that and when it\u2019s all business. \u2018I\u2019m going to try to make you a million dollars tonight,\u2019 and then maybe later he hits me in the back of the head with something and thinks it\u2019s hilarious!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Corbin still has his goals of holding championship gold in the WWE and one day making it into the Hall of Fame, he has his plans for when his in-ring career comes to an end \u2013 although he doesn\u2019t want to think too far ahead.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a guy who lives in the moment,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018I know little things I want to do when I leave WWE, like I want to own a whisky, wine, cigar bar called The Liars Club and it\u2019ll be an awesome bar with crazy oddities in it. I collect oddities, I\u2019ve got human skulls at home.\n\n\u2018Those are little things, but to the extent staying involved \u2013 I just don\u2019t know. You have guys like The Undertaker and Hunter who grab onto me a little bit. They\u2019ve done amazing things \u2013 I wanna be in the Hall of Fame. I wanna be the guy where when I\u2019m done, 15 years from now people go \u201cHoly crap, he was really good, we didn\u2019t realise it.\u201d That\u2019s what I want.\u2019\n\nFriday Night SmackDown airs every week at 1am on Sky Sports Arena and Main Event.
