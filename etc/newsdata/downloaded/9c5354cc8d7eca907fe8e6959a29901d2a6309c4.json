The property has nine years of a 20-year lease to Woolworths to run and generates an income of $761,000 annually.\n\nThe sharpest yield from the auction was achieved on the sale of the Woolworths Metro Abbotsford property in inner-city Melbourne. It sold off-the-plan to a South Australian investor for $4.68 million on a yield of 4.93 per cent.\n\nCBRE's Mark Wizel said the sell-out auction was evidence of the strong appetite for commercial property driven by the record low cost of debt and the lack of investment opportunities over the first half of 2019.\n\n\"With only two freestanding supermarket investment opportunities offered to the market prior to this event, it was clear that pent-up demand was a key factor in the clearance rate and the prices achieved,\" he said.", "description": "A portfolio of four retail properties around Victoria has sold out to different investors, primed by the lower cost of debt.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2942%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/eb1233c2c7c4d5324a8b5fcb7aeb5ecb33e9863b", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
