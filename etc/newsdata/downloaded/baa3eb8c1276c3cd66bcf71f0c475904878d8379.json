The demonstration took on a festival-like feel as bands played and kids danced in a park.\n\nMarie-Lou Sahai, 15, said she skipped school because \u201cthe only way to make people listen is to protest.\u201d\n\nAnd in Washington, several thousand young people marched to the Capitol building carrying signs reading \u201cThere is no Planet B\u201d and \u201cThis can\u2019t wait until I finish high school.\u201d\n\n\u201cBasically our earth is dying and if we don\u2019t do something about it, we die,\u201d said A.J. Conermann, a 15-year old sophomore. \u201cI want to grow up. I want to have a future.\u201d\n\nThe protests were partly inspired by the activism of Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who has staged weekly demonstrations under the heading \u201cFridays for Future\u201d over the past year, urging world leaders to step up their efforts against climate change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a victory,\u201d Thunberg said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press in New York. \u201cI would never have predicted or believed that this was going to happen, and so fast \u2014 and only in 15 months.\u201d\n\nThunberg is expected to participate in a U.N. Youth Climate Summit on Saturday and speak at the U.N. Climate Action Summit with global leaders on Monday.\n\n\u201cThey have this opportunity to do something, and they should take that,\u201d she said in the interview. \u201cAnd otherwise, they should feel ashamed.\u201d\n\nThe world has warmed about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit) since before the Industrial Revolution, and scientists have attributed more than 90 percent of the increase to emissions of heat-trapping gases from fuel-burning and other human activity.\n\nScientists have warned that global warming will subject Earth to rising seas and more heat waves, droughts, powerful storms, flooding and other problems, and that some have already started manifesting themselves.\n\nNations around the world agreed at a 2015 summit in Paris to hold warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) more than pre-industrial-era levels by the end of this century.\n\nBut U.S. President Trump subsequently announced that he was withdrawing the U.S. from the agreement, which he said benefited other nations at the expense of American businesses and taxpayers.\n\nTrump referred to global warming as a \u201choax\u201d before becoming president. He has since said he\u2019s \u201cnot denying climate change\u201d but is not convinced it\u2019s manmade or permanent.\n\nThe U.N. summit is aimed at eliciting concrete proposals from various countries to make progress toward the Paris goal.\n\nFriday\u2019s demonstrations started in Australia, where organizers estimated 300,000 protesters marched in 110 towns and cities, including Sydney and the national capital, Canberra. Demonstrators called for their country, the world\u2019s largest exporter of coal and liquid natural gas, to take more drastic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHundreds of rallies took place across Europe, including in the Czech Republic, Germany, Britain and Poland, which is still widely coal-reliant and where many middle schools gave students the day off to enable them to participate in the rallies in Warsaw and other cities.\n\nIn Berlin, police said more than 100,000 people gathered in front of the capital\u2019s landmark Brandenburg Gate, not far from Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s, office where the Cabinet thrashed out the final details of a 54 billion euro ($60 billion) plan to curb Germany\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions .\n\nThousands of schoolchildren and their adult supporters demonstrated in London outside the British Parliament, some holding home-made placards with slogans including \u201cDon\u2019t be a fossil fool\u201d and \u201cMake our planet Greta again,\u201d in a reference Thunberg.\n\nThe British government said it endorsed the protesters\u2019 message but didn\u2019t condone skipping school \u2014 a stance that didn\u2019t sit well with some of the young protesters.\n\n\u201cIf politicians were taking the appropriate action we need and had been taking this action a long time ago when it was recognized the world was changing in a negative way, then I would not have to be skipping school,\u201d said Jessica Ahmed, a 16-year-old London student.\n\nIn Helsinki, the Finnish capital, a man dressed as Santa Claus stood outside parliament holding a sign: \u201cMy house is on fire, my reindeer can\u2019t swim.\u201d\n\nSmaller protests took place in Asia, including in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Hong Kong and India.\n\n\u201cWe need to reclaim our constitutional right to clean air and water,\u201d said Aman Sharma, a 16-year-old protester in India\u2019s capital of New Delhi.\n\nIn Tokyo, hundreds of students and environmental activists marched through the business and shopping district of Shibuya, chanting \u201cClimate Justice!\u201d while holding hand-painted placards with messages such as \u201cGo Green\u201d and \u201cSave the Earth.\u201d\n\nSmaller rallies were held in more than a dozen other cities around Japan, including Kyoto, the nation\u2019s ancient capital that hosted the 1997 climate conference.\n\nAnd in the Afghan capital, Kabul, an armored personnel carrier was deployed to protect about 100 young people as they marched, led by a group of several young women carrying a banner emblazoned with \u201cFridays for Future.\u201d\n\nFardeen Barakzai, one of the organizers and head of the local climate activist group, Oxygen, said Afghan youths \u201cknow the problem of climate change. We know war can kill a group of people. \u2026 The problem in Afghanistan is our leaders are fighting for power, but the real power is in nature.\u201d\n\nIn Africa, rallies were held in Johannesburg and the South African capital, Pretoria, as well as Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi, where some young protesters wore hats and outfits made from plastic bottles to emphasize the dangers of plastic waste, a major threat to cities and oceans.\n\nAfrica is the most vulnerable continent to climate change and the least equipped to deal with it, experts have said. Governments have pleaded for more support from the international community.\n\nClimate change \u201cis worse than homework,\u201d one sign proclaimed.\n\n___\n\nMcGuirk reported from Canberra, Australia.
