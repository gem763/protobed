Labour has long warned of falling vaccination rates.\n\n\u201cA decade of funding squeezes imposed on general practice, cuts to public health and falling health visitors numbers is putting children at risk of very serious illness.\n\n\u201cThe health and wellbeing of children should be a priority for ministers.\n\nAs this report suggests, parents need consistent reminders and better access to vaccine appointments.\n\nBut the government also needs to properly fund services as a whole to help tackle this vital issue.\"\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"We are incredibly concerned by the decline of vaccination rates and are taking urgent action to reverse this.\"\n\nDr Sarah Wollaston, Chair of the Health and Social Care Committee, said: \u201cThe decline in vaccination rates for children in recent years is worrying as is the degree of variation.\n\n\u201cMy Committee will be questioning the Department of Health and Social Care,\n\nNHS England and Public Health England at a hearing in November to press them on their plans to protect children and their wider communities by improving the uptake of vaccinations.\u201d", "description": "Uptake of nearly all pre-school vaccinations in England has declined since 2012", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Image", "Pa", "Daily Mirror", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20721252.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Measles-vaccinations.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
