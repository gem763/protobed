Giuliani said that if Congress seeks to enforce a subpoena, then he will retain counsel.\n\nAs part of his final acts as his attorney, Sale sent a letter to Congress on Tuesday replying to the subpoena Giuliani was sent.\n\nTuesday was the deadline for Giuliani to comply with a wide-ranging subpoena for documents from three of the House committees working on the growing impeachment inquiry into President Trump.\n\nIn their subpoena sent to Giuliani late last month, Reps. Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler and Elijah Cummings said that Giuliani had \"admitted on national television that, while serving as the president\u2019s personal attorney, he asked the government of Ukraine to target former Vice President Joe Biden.\"\n\n\u201cA growing public record indicates that the President, his agent Rudy Giuliani, and others appear to have pressed the Ukrainian government to pursue two politically-motivated investigations,\u201d the Democratic chairmen wrote. \u201cThe Committees have reason to believe that you have information and documents relevant to these matters.\u201d\n\nAram Roston/Reuters\n\nGiuliani had previously told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos that he would \u201cconsider\u201d cooperating with the congressional request but only if his client, President Trump, signed off.\n\n\"I'm a lawyer. It's his privilege, not mine,\" Giuliani told ABC News last month. \"If he decides that he wants me to testify, of course I'll testify, even though I think Adam Schiff is an illegitimate chairman. He has already prejudged the case.\"\n\nGiuliani has emerged as a central figure in the inquiry. Citing recent testimony by witnesses, Democrats accuse Giuliani of running a shadow foreign policy operation to benefit the Trump campaign. Two Ukrainian-American businessmen who reportedly helped Giuliani to investigate Trump\u2019s political rival, Joe Biden, and Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, were indicted last week on campaign finance charges.\n\nGuiliani\u2019s business relationships remain the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by federal authorities in New York.\n\nABC News' Anne Flaherty contributed to this report.", "description": "Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, told ABC News on Tuesday that he will not comply with a congressional subpoena.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/giuliani-gty-jc-190923_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
