To my mind this should be Northumbria, which exposed the lies the Met police failed to spot.'\n\nHarvey Proctor (pictured) has led calls for Met police chiefs to face justice after a report laid bare the scale of the failures of Scotland Yard's investigation into a non-existent Westminster paedophile ring\n\nA cabinet minister also told the newspaper that the police failings 'should not be left to lie'.\n\nThey said: 'Knowingly misleading the courts is extremely serious and of huge gravity. There needs to be a full and frank investigation into this, which could lead to a criminal inquiry into whether the course of justice has been perverted by the police.'\n\nMr Proctor said said that a further review ordered by Priti Patel was only the 'first step'.\n\nHe added that Northumbria Police which secured Beech's convictions was ideally placed to take on the case.\n\nMore findings of the highly critical review of Operation Midland, which has to date cost the Metropolitan Police around \u00a34.5million, were published by the force today after mounting pressure to be open and transparent.\n\nSteve Rodhouse, who oversaw the operation, apologised.

And this evening Mr Proctor told Andrew Pierce he is 'saving' his 'fire power for the metropolitan police'.\n\n'I have to keep strong because if I dwell too much on detail I dissemble. I keep strong to try to make sure no other person suffers at the hand of the met police from false accusers,' he added.\n\n'No one should go through what I went through these last few years.'\n\nEarlier today he criticised Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe and Cressida Dick for 'weasel words of apology' after claims he was a member of a Westminster paedophile ring left him facing death threats.\n\nAnd this evening Mr Proctor said he only feels 'icy contempt' for Carl Beech because it was the Metropolitan Police who gave rise to his lies.\n\n'In my impact statement at the conclusion of his trial I referred to 'Nick' with icy contempt. That is what I feel. Icy contempt,' he told LBC.\n\nSir Richard criticised the Met's culture of believing victims and today Sir Steve House (pictured) said the force had 're-explained' its policy to detectives\n\n'If Carl Beech wanted to spread his fantasies on social media do you think I would give a damn. It was when police who said he was credible and true and that was when the damage was done to me.'\n\nAs the hour-long interview came to a close he blasted police chiefs, calling them 'donkeys' who should not be leading the 'brave and courageous bobby on the beat'.\n\n'When I was an MP I was supportive of the police force. I am now supportive in this way,' he added.\n\n'I think bobby on the beat is brave and courageous. They do not deserve to be led by donkeys.'\n\nEarlier today he told BBC Radio 4's The World At One he lost 'my job, my home, my repute' following false claims that he was involved in the sexual abuse.\n\nHe admitted he was 'not the same person I used to be' as a damning report released today laid bare Scotland Yard's shocking failures when investigating the case.\n\nHe said: 'I'm trying to get over it, but it's proving very difficult. I have said before that I'm not the same person I used to be.\n\n'I don't think I'll ever be that person again. I've lost my job, my home, my repute. I've been the subject of death threats.\n\n'Weasel words by Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe and Cressida Dick by way of apology, but nothing to put me back to where I was in March 2015 when I'd spent 30 years building myself up to that position, after an earlier difficulty.\n\n'I don't have another 30 years to re-do that.'\n\nThe homes of Mr Proctor, D-Day veteran Lord Bramall and Lady Diana Brittan, the widow of former home secretary Leon Brittan, were raided on the basis of false claims made by fantasist Carl Beech, then known as 'Nick'.\n\nThen-force chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has made a series of extraordinary apologies over the disastrous investigation, that has to date cost the force around \u00a34.5 million.\n\nThis includes payouts to the Brittan family and Lord Bramall. Mr Proctor is suing the Met for \u00a31million and a settlement has yet to be reached.\n\nSir Alan Duncan, Conservative MP for Rutland and Melton, said today: 'The damming Henriques report against the Met Police should not be used to delay the payment of massive compensation to my constituent Harvey Proctor.\n\n'They must agree to settle his financial claim and pay up now. The police are supposed to be there to address injustice but here they have themselves created it. They must compensate my constituent Harvey Proctor.'\n\nIt came as Scotland Yard was accused of 'institutional stupidity' in its disastrous investigation into claims of the VIP paedophile ring in Westminster as the report blamed 'poor judgment and a failure to accurately evaluate known facts'.\n\nThe report concluded search warrants were 'obtained unlawfully' and that the magistrate who granted them was 'misled'.\n\nToday Scotland Yard said it was 'deeply, deeply sorry' for mistakes made in the bungled Operation Midland investigation and the detective in charge has apologised but said he acted with the best of intentions.\n\nDowning Street said it was 'vital' the public was reassured the Met had learned lessons, while Labour deputy leader Tom Watson failed to apologise despite the report concluding his interest put pressure on police.\n\nCarl Beech - known as 'Nick' - was jailed for 18 years for perverting the course after making up preposterous tales, dubbed 'credible and true' by the Met, that ruined the lives and reputations of some of Britain's most distinguished public servants.\n\nLies told by Carl Beech, pictured left in a police interview, were believed by the Met Police despite previously Wiltshire Police having concluded: 'it all sounds a bit 'Spooks'\n\nHis easily-disproved lies were swallowed by bungling Scotland Yard detectives who launched a taxpayer-funded 'witchhunt', Operation Midland, that resulted in Thatcher's Home Secretary Lord Brittan dying under a cloud of suspicion and an ex-Tory MP losing his job and home.\n\nThe Met has faced howls of criticism after it emerged that none of the five officers referred to the IOPC for their involvement in the case faced any censure.\n\nIn a series of damning findings - first published by the Mail after exclusive interviews with Sir Richard - his report concluded that search warrants for the homes of men Beech accused were 'obtained unlawfully' and that the magistrate who granted them was 'misled'.\n\n'The written applications stated that 'Nick's' account had remained consistent and he is felt to be a credible witness who is telling the truth,' it said.\n\n''Nick's' account had not been consistent throughout. Further, there were, in my judgment no reasonable grounds to believe 'Nick' and the statement that he had told the truth was not consistent with information then available.'\n\nThe report said: 'Whilst the responsible officers assert that they kept an open mind, several failures can only be explained by an unwarranted and disproportionate belief in 'Nick's' credibility.\n\n'The most significant error in this investigation was the decision to apply for search warrants coupled with formulating inaccurate statements which were placed before the district judge.\n\n'But for that decision, this investigation may well have been completed without the dreadful adverse consequences I have described.'\n\nThe full report released today 43 'principal police failings'. Among them Sir Richard found that the Metropolitan Police:\n\nBelieved Beech from the outset while Wiltshire police had found his claims 'all a bit odd' and said 'it all sounds a bit 'Spooks' '\n\nWere months late in interviewing Beech's ex-wife and his mother, both of who testimonies contradicted his claims\n\nCarried out searches poorly: property was seized which was authorised by the warrant, the North Yorkshire search was conducted 'as if looking for bodies or body parts', property was not returned properly, and police contributed to the loss of anonymity of the accused\n\nAsked a psychologist to examine Beech, but did not provide his police interviews or blogs\n\nDid not ask to inspect Beech's computer because of the policy that 'victims must be believed'\n\nFailed to check Beech's computer when he provided emails, allegedly from a corroborating witness, which were copied-and-pasted to obscure the sender\n\nShould have terminated the investigation in December 2015 on advice from CPS\n\nShould have dropped the investigation into Harvey Proctor in January 2016 when they dropped the case relating to Lord Bramall - because if Beech was unreliable in relation to one alleged abuser he was unreliable in relation to the other\n\nToday Met Deputy Commissioner Sir Stephen House said: 'I am deeply, deeply sorry for the mistakes that were made and the ongoing pain these have caused.\n\n'I promise we will do all we can to prevent them in the future.'\n\nHe also said: 'The Met is determined to learn lessons from Sir Richard's review to improve our response to similar situations in the future', and added: 'Mistakes were made in Operation Midland and we have apologised for those. We apologise for them again today.'\n\nBut, he added: 'However, we do not agree with everything Sir Richard wrote in his report or indeed all of his recent statements regarding further investigations into the actions of officers.'\n\nHe insisted the IOPC had cleared officers of misconduct saying: 'That should be where this ends for those individuals.'\n\nThe report blamed the force's policy of believing victims as a core failing underlying the investigation.\n\nToday the deputy commissioner told reporters outside New Scotland Yard: 'We've re-explained to officers' the force's position on belief.'\n\nHe added: 'We explained we expect them to deal with all victims sensitively, to record their allegation accurately, but then to carry out an investigative function which would include gaining corroboration for the allegation themselves.'\n\nSteve Rodhouse, who oversaw the operation, said: 'I am sincerely sorry for the distress that has been caused to innocent people and their families as a consequence of Operation Midland and Operation Vincente.'\n\nBut, he added: 'My actions have been considered by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) who will shortly publish their detailed reasons for concluding that there was no misconduct by me.\n\n'I understand the criticisms that have been made of my decisions during these investigations but I acted with the best of intentions throughout and I hope that I have demonstrated the transparency, honesty and integrity which have always been vital to me.'\n\nOne source who read a pre-released copy of the report said Mr Rodhouse's new \u00a3240,000-a-year job at the National Crime Agency is 'untenable' and that he must step down or be removed from his post immediately.\n\nLabour deputy leader Tom Watson today denied putting pressure on police despite the report finding his interest did in fact do so.\n\nThe report quoted an article from 2015 revealing how Mr Watson spoke to two people including Beech who claimed he was abused by former home secretary Leon Brittan and had been attacked more than a dozen times as a boy.\n\nThe report said: 'There can be no doubt that Tom Watson believed 'Nick' and it should be stated that he had previously provided the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) with information leading to convictions in other cases.\n\n'His interest, however, in both Operation Midland and Operation Vincente created further pressure upon MPS officers.'\n\nIn a statement Mr Watson said: 'The report doesn't make clear the key point that Lord Brittan was interviewed by the police before they received my letter.\n\n'Ex-director of public prosecutions Alison Saunders publicly confirmed that my letter was not received by police until after the interview.\n\n'It therefore cannot be argued that it was pressure from me that led to Lord Brittan being interviewed.\n\n'I have always said that it wasn't my place to judge whether sexual abuse allegations were true or false \u2013 that was for the police.'\n\nDaniel Janner, the son of the late Labour MP Lord Janner who was one of Beech's victims, accused Mr Watson of being 'partially responsible'.\n\nHe claimed Mr Watson - who raised the matter in Parliament after speaking to Beech - 'applied pressure on the police and should hang his head in shame and resign'.\n\nAnd Lord Brittan's widow told The Times: 'The extent of Tom Watson's involvement in the witch-hunt of innocent people has been laid bare for all to see.\n\n'His subsequent attempts to distance himself show a complete lack of integrity.\n\n'By misusing his public office to recklessly repeat false allegations, and to characterise himself as a victim, he has shown that he is unfit to hold the office of MP.'\n\nAfter the report's release today, Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve House was asked about Mr Watson's role in pressuring police.\n\nHe said: 'I won't refer direct to Tom Watson, I think you're going to have to speak to him more about that.\n\n'But I think it's quite clear, at the time there was a significant amount of pressure on a lot of different public bodies in relation to not taking seriously, allegations around this sort of assault.\n\nA heavily redacted summary of a report by retired high court judge Sir Richard Henriques - which identified 43 major blunders in Operation Midland - was released three years ago after the inquiry was closed without any arrests or charges.\n\nThen-force chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe made a series of extraordinary apologies over the disastrous investigation, that has to date cost the force around \u00a34.5 million. This includes payouts to the Brittan family and Lord Bramall. Mr Proctor is suing the Met for \u00a31 million and a settlement has yet to be reached.\n\nYesterday the Mail revealed that Home Secretary Priti Patel has told the Inspectorate of Constabulary, the police watchdog, to review the force's actions as well.\n\nAmong its principal conclusions the report finds:", "description": "Richard Henriques's review revealed allegations of police misconduct prompting demands for a criminal inquiry from Harvey Proctor among others.", "authors": ["Amelia Wynne For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/01/19320596-0-image-a-38_1570235646861.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
