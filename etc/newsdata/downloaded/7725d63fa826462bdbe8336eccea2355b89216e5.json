PRECIOUS-Gold steadies as investors await concrete signals on trade, Brexit\n\n(Adds details and comments)\n\n* Palladium holds near all-time peak\n\n* Technical resistance for gold around $1,520/oz - analyst\n\n* Gold eyes small weekly decline\n\n\n\nBy Arpan Varghese\n\nOct 11 (Reuters) - Gold prices steadied on Friday, settling\n\ninto a narrow range as investors awaited more clarity on global\n\nuncertainties including trade and Brexit, helping the metal\n\nshake off initial declines driven by hopes for a breakthrough in\n\nthe U.S.-China talks.\n\nPalladium, meanwhile, was down 0.1% at $1,698.33 per ounce,\n\nas of 0306 GMT, but held close to Thursday's all-time peak of\n\n$1,704.59 an ounce, putting it on track for an about 2% weekly\n\ngain.\n\nSpot gold inched 0.2% higher to $1,496.49 per ounce,\n\nwhile U.S. gold futures GCcv1 were little changed at\n\n$1,501.00.\n\n\"We have news that is positive in terms of trade talks, but\n\nno actual resolution yet. The market is still a little\n\nsceptical,\" said Brian Lan, managing director at dealer\n\nGoldSilver Central in Singapore.\n\n\"A few things are still hanging, including a no-deal Brexit.\n\nTime is ticking but not much progress is happening. The\n\n(situation in) Hong Kong is also not resolved.\"\n\nEquity markets gained after U.S. President Donald Trump said\n\nhe would meet with China's top trade negotiator, while a White\n\nHouse official said the first day of talks had gone \"probably\n\nbetter than expected.\" MKTS/GLOB\n\nWhile the two sides could reach some sort of agreements on\n\naspects such as currencies and copyright protections, they were\n\nnot expected to address the most contentious issues.\n\nAlso helping gold, the dollar, which has emerged as an\n\nalternative safe-haven during the trade war, was a shade weaker\n\nversus its rivals . USD/\n\nOver to Brexit, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on\n\nThursday a deal could be clinched by end-October to allow the UK\n\nto leave the European Union in an orderly fashion, after what he\n\ncalled a very positive meeting with Boris Johnson.

Otherwise, it will be a case of\n\nhurry-up-and-wait for the main event in Washington DC this\n\nafternoon and evening.\"\n\nInvestors will also keep a close eye on any cues from the\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve, with data on Thursday showing U.S.\n\nconsumer prices were unchanged in September while underlying\n\ninflation retreated, supporting expectations the Fed will cut\n\ninterest rates in October.
