It\u2019s about being adaptable.\u2019\n\nCole enjoyed an exceptional spell with Chelsea as a player, racking up 338 appearances for the club and winning nine major honours including the Champions League across an eight-year period.\n\nAshley Cole has joined a number of former Chelsea players at the club including Petr Cech and Eddie Newton (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe former England international has linked up with his former Chelsea teammates Lampard, Petr Cech, Claude Makelele, Joe Cole, Paulo Ferreira, Carlo Cudicini and Henrique Hilario as part of the club\u2019s backroom team.\n\n\u2018The Academy are very good at giving ex-players a route back to the club and a chance to learn as coaches,\u2019 Cole said. \u2018They\u2019re eager to bring in people who understand what it means to be at Chelsea and what it means to wear the badge.\n\n\u2018You have to be a top player to play for Chelsea so they want those top ex-players influencing and trying to help the next generation develop and be better players.\n\n\u2018Chelsea have been quick and probably one of the first clubs to really tap into that, not just with coaches but staff in the loans team and other departments, to bring them back to pass on their experience and expertise.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Ashley Cole has revealed that he wants to take aspects of Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti and Arsene Wenger's management styles after starting his coaching career with Chelsea.
