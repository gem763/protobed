As they would have it, President Trump\u2019s allegations of corruption against Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son are absolutely baseless. Of course, it\u2019s an altogether different story for Trump, against whom the slightest innuendo of irregularity is taken as evidence of wrongdoing and allegations must always be true.\n\nIt is, of course, pass\u00e9 to point out this double standard, but it really can\u2019t be repeated enough, particularly as the media goes into overdrive to run interference on the Biden scandal.\n\nDismissive Denials\n\nA recent story in the New Yorker on the \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d positions itself as the last word on the matter. It\u2019s an exemplar in a certain journalistic style of presumption\u2014a style that has become very common in the era of Trump and breathless, self-righteous \u201cfact-checking.\u201d Author Jane Mayer traces the story from its origins in the fringes of the Breitbart-verse, through its infection of respected, totally conspiracy-free newspapers, such as the New York Times.\n\nThe story bears the headline, \u201cThe Invention of the Conspiracy Theory on Biden and Ukraine\u201d\u2014an extraordinarily definitive title for a piece in which the supporting evidence is slight.\n\nMayer doesn\u2019t challenge the allegations against Biden so much as airily dismiss them by pointing to that nebulous cloud, so useful, so beloved by journalists, of \u201cthe facts.\u201d The Biden-Ukraine story, writes Mayer, is a \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201crepeatedly discredited\u201d (by whom?) conspiracy theory. The reader is instantly alerted to the pernicious workings of \u201cconservative operatives\u201d who have \u201cweaponized\u201d the story for political purposes.\n\nAs Mayer goes on to trace the story\u2019s emergence, we encounter the same style of presumption. The success of the Biden narrative is proof of the ability of \u201cpolitical partisans\u201d to influence the mainstream media (the media isn\u2019t partisan?) and a worrisome sign of just how hard it is to fight \u201cdisinformation\u201d these days.\n\nMuch of the article focuses not on rebutting the Biden story, but on tracing it to right-wing journalists, like John Solomon, who had been a \u201crespected\u201d reporter for the Washington Post\u2014that is, until he began working for \u201covertly conservative outlets\u201d like the Washington Times and fell into disrepute\u2014and Breitbart editor Peter Schweitzer. Schweitzer, Mayer observes, previously peddled \u201cdisinformation\u201d about conflicts of interest involving the Clinton Foundation in 2016 in the book Clinton Cash, particularly the Uranium One story, which \u201cenabled Clinton\u2019s opponents to frame her as greedy and corrupt.\u201d The New York Times, apparently forgetting its mission to combat right-wing hate-facts, credulously printed Schweitzer\u2019s allegations.\n\nNow, Schweitzer has peddled fresh \u201cbaseless tales\u201d about the Bidens. But what does the story\u2019s genealogy have to do with the truth of the actual allegations? Is Joe Biden crooked or not? Thankfully, the question has been settled easily and without much need for reflection. The \u201cfact-checkers\u201d have made quick work of the whole thing:\n\nAmong those officials was Viktor Shokin, a former top Ukrainian prosecutor who was sacked in March 2016, after European and U.S. officials, including Joe Biden, complained that he was lax in curbing corruption. Shokin claimed that he had lost his powerful post not because of his poor performance but rather because Biden wanted to stop his investigation of Burisma, in order to protect his son. The facts didn\u2019t back this up. The Burisma investigation had been dormant under Shokin. (Emphasis added.)\n\nThis is almost the entirety of the rebuttal given to the corruption allegations: it\u2019s a conspiracy theory because \u201cthe facts\u201d said so. But \u201cthe facts\u201d invoked here, as is so often the case in the lapdog press, are a mere substitute for factual demonstration. After invoking \u201cthe facts,\u201d we get a series of neat, settled talking points meant to dismiss any doubts about the incontrovertible truth of the narrative.\n\nTroublesome Facts Just Aren\u2019t Facts\n\nThe claim being referenced here, of course, is that Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who had investigated a company, Burisma Holdings, on whose board Hunter sat. The former vice president famously bragged about getting the \u201cson of a bitch\u201d fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees.\n\nThat looks bad for Biden, and we can\u2019t have that. Happily, the \u201cfact checkers\u201d have already put out the fire. Their rebuttal is a typically incurious one: Shokin was fired, not for going after Burisma, but for not pursuing corruption, and Burisma, enough. Yes, of course. The Burisma investigation was \u201cdormant,\u201d whatever that means, under Shokin, and there was international pressure for his firing anyway, so Biden really should be applauded for sacking him.\n\nThere is so much that has been left unsettled here. Perhaps it warrants some journalistic investigation? For one thing, the fact that Western governments and international institutions were not happy with Shokin does not exclude the possibility that Biden wanted him fired for his own reasons.\n\nWhile the official story for Biden\u2019s trip to Ukraine was that he was there to offer them help in fighting corruption and reforming the country after its revolution, at that very time his son was making a killing at a company run by an \u201coligarch\u201d and former minister of ex-president Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia after the revolution. But there was absolutely no conflict between Biden\u2019s official mission and the personal interests of his son? Really? Even the New York Times acknowledged, in a December 2015 article, that Biden\u2019s \u201ccredibility\u201d in fighting corruption risked being \u201cundermined\u201d by Hunter\u2019s position at Burisma. You don\u2019t say?\n\nHunter Biden got the job in 2014, shortly after his father became Obama\u2019s point man for Kiev. Must have been a coincidence. The State Department said at the time that young Biden was a \u201cprivate citizen\u201d and that there was no conflict. But didn\u2019t Hunter\u2019s position call into question the purity of his father\u2019s motives in pursuing the whole anti-corruption thing in Ukraine, just a tiny bit?\n\nBut the fact-checkers seem satisfied with this explanation. The famously non-corrupt State Department and EU were behind Shokin\u2019s firing, so there\u2019s nothing to see here. But if there was an investigation into Burisma, then Biden had a conflict of interest, period, and any media worthy of respect would have more, not fewer, questions about what happened.\n\nIncuriosity Is Killing Our Press\n\nThe \u201cfact-checkers\u201d seem satisfied that there was no investigation, that it was \u201cdormant.\u201d But what the hell does \u201cdormant\u201d mean? In other words, there was an investigation, but it was suspended? What does that prove? Did Biden know that the investigation was dormant, or sleeping, or hibernating, or whatever it was supposed to be doing? And how do we know he did not expect it someday to resume?\n\nNobody has shown that the investigation was officially closed, or even \u201cdormant.\u201d The Ukrainians have given conflicting accounts. The \u201cdormant\u201d claim appears to stem from a single Bloomberg story citing Shokin\u2019s former deputy, Vitaliy Kasko. According to Kasko, the Burisma probe was \u201cshelved\u201d in 2014 and 2015. (Shokin was fired in 2016.) But Shokin has said in a sworn affidavit that he was actively investigating Burisma and that he was fired because Biden wanted him gone.\n\nAccording to the \u201cfact-checkers,\u201d the sources pushing the Biden story can\u2019t be trusted. Solomon, who helped promote the Biden story in a series of columns for The Hill, cited what Mayer calls \u201cquestionable\u201d sources. Those sources included Shokin himself and his successor, Yuri Lutensko. Why are Shokin and Lutsenko untrustworthy, while Kasko has the last word?\n\nOf course, we don\u2019t know that Biden did anything wrong, but to call it a conspiracy theory? The media haven\u2019t dedicated a fraction of the energy they poured into the Russia collusion coup into this story, but already, they seem to have the whole thing figured out.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on here? The media isn\u2019t doing any \u201cfact-checking\u201d on the Biden-Ukraine story. Rather, they are doing narrative gatekeeping. Instead of investigating plain conflicts of interests, they have drawn up a list of talking points to control the story.\n\nThis isn\u2019t new. The media has shown a similar lack of interest toward investigating, and hostility towards those who are investigating, the origins of the Trump-Russia hoax. As the Ukraine story unfolded, Bill Barr was slammed for chasing \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d abroad by enlisting foreign countries in his review of the Russia probe.\n\nIn all of these controversies, journalists have shown reliable laziness in alluding, hazily, to \u201cthe facts\u201d to dismiss politically damaging or inconvenient narratives. When journalists refer to \u201cthe facts\u201d in the abstract, they aren\u2019t referring to concrete fact patterns so much as invoking their sole authority to decide what it is and is not respectable to believe.\n\nThey really are begging the question: X is a conspiracy theory because the facts said so, and we journalists, the gatekeepers of the narrative, have exclusive authority to decide which \u201cfacts\u201d are actually facts and which ones are \u201cRepublican talking points.\u201d QED. So whenever Trump makes some damaging claim about a rival, it\u2019s \u201cwithout evidence.\u201d But when somebody makes a damaging claim about Trump without evidence, it\u2019s just true.\n\nThe Presumption of Right-Wing Guilt\n\nIn the mainstream media, any stories that originate on the Right are by definition positioned as batty and suspect\u2014not for any reason of logic, but because they don\u2019t jibe with the political sensibilities of what is called the \u201cmainstream\u201d media but is really a corporate leftist media. When press says that something is a conspiracy theory because Fox News is interested in it, they aren\u2019t exactly saying it\u2019s false. They\u2019re making a value judgment, saying it\u2019s the kind of thing that it is not acceptable or fashionable to admit in public that you believe, even if it\u2019s reasonable to do so.\n\nNote the two-pronged approach: first, the journalist adverts to \u201cthe facts,\u201d without actually providing proof, to dismiss the damaging narrative out of hand. Then the narrative is positioned morally as suspect and as a \u201cright-wing conspiracy theory.\u201d Both techniques are really just a way for the media to assert its authority, a way of saying, \u201cwe journalists have decided this never happened, and anyone who thinks it did is crazy, uninformed, or racist.\u201d\n\nMayer\u2019s article is filled with signal words that are supposed to alert the reader of right-wing \u201cdisinformation.\u201d The so-called mainstream media is imagined to be nonpartisan and \u201csusceptible\u201d to attack by shadowy right-wing actors. People who heard damaging stories about Clinton\u2019s corruption in 2016 had been \u201cmisinformed.\u201d The conservative media is an \u201cecho chamber\u201d\u2014completely unlike the leftist of our media, of course\u2014where calumny thrives. The once reputable Solomon discredited himself by working for mainstream right-of-center outlets like the Washington Times.\n\nWith the explosion of the Biden story into the mainstream, voters have been left in a \u201cfog of suspicion and confusion\u201d where it\u2019s impossible to tell truth from fact, and\u2014perish the thought\u2014they have been presented with the possibility that Biden may not be such an upright guy after all; maybe he\u2019s even as bad as Trump!\n\nDisruption of the mainstream media narrative is imagined to be some kind of epistemological catastrophe, leaving voters with terminal political vertigo. The masses who are credulous enough to think that elite corruption (at least by a Clinton or a Biden) is a real thing have been victimized by \u201cpartisan\u201d sources, and it\u2019s the job of the Brave Journalists \u2122 at places like the New York Times to keep the story straight. Yet just by printing articles on the \u201cconspiracy theory,\u201d a newspaper with the \u201ccredibility\u201d of the New York Times is validating tall tales.\n\nThe New York Times has shown plenty of editorial \u201cresponsibility,\u201d if you take the term to mean a commitment to the narrative, facts be damned. The paper\u2019s recent Kavanaugh debacle, coming as it did only weeks after launching the revisionist 1619 project, showed just how far the paper has devolved into a workshop for churning out pop-academic left-wing agitprop.\n\n\u201cCredibility\u201d in blue-check-ese, is a signifier of political respectability, not factual correctness. Credible newspapers are so-called because they are \u201cwoke\u201d and committed to the cause, no matter how divorced from reality they might actually be. By the same token, a conspiracy theory appears to be any story that might validate the grievances of the Right, if it were to be investigated with due diligence.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely crazy to ask people to think that Hunter Biden got a job with a Ukrainian oil company without his father pulling any strings. No reasonable person would dismiss the possibility. He got the job despite having no experience in the industry or in the region, to say nothing of his tabloid-worthy lifestyle, which got him kicked out of the Navy for cocaine use months beforehand? Despite all this baggage, he got an extremely lucrative do-nothing job in a notoriously corrupt country, and his dad didn\u2019t help?\n\nProtecting Their Own\n\nTo call anyone who sees signs of impropriety here a \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d is simply obtuse. Or is the assumption that this kind of behavior is normal and expected from our elites\u2014that it\u2019s just something that everyone should casually accept as part of the business of politics, or at least banal when compared with the unique, metaphysical evils of Donald Drumpf? Many in the corporate leftist media seem to agree that Hunter\u2019s business was untoward, even if it didn\u2019t technically rise to the level of illegality. Then again, do we even know that\u2019s true?\n\nDid Biden have Shokin fired for corrupt reasons? Well, is Biden capable of corruption? The media seems to think not, as evinced by their shrugs at this obvious conflict of interest. But the answer is self-evident from the fact that his son was working for Burisma Holdings in the first place. If Biden\u2019s story is a \u201cworrisome\u201d example of \u201clegal corruption,\u201d as even some liberal newspapers will concede, why the complete conviction that nothing more nefarious occurred below the obviously seedy surface?\n\nThe former vice president hasn\u2019t gotten his story straight. He has said that he \u201cnever\u201d spoke with his son about his business dealings, something that has been contested by Hunter himself. Again, would any reasonable person believe that Biden never talked to Hunter about it? A photograph exists of the vice president and his son with a board member from Burisma Holdings, the company Biden never talked about with his son. Yet they were, golfing in the Hamptons the year Hunter Biden joined the company.\n\nCommon sense would suggest that it\u2019s at least plausible to question whether Joe Biden engaged in political maneuvering on his son\u2019s behalf. It\u2019s not like it would be the first time, anyway. But the establishment press\u2014a profession that used to operate on the adage, \u201cif your mother tells you she loves you, check it out\u201d\u2014has decided that there\u2019s nothing more to discover.\n\nThat\u2019s the complete opposite of what \u201cjournalists\u201d are supposed to pride themselves on doing. Here is clear evidence of pay-to-play dealing by one of our political elites, but the media is more interested in narrative gatekeeping\u2014because Biden can\u2019t possibly be as bad as Trump, right? Even if it\u2019s possible, best to do whatever we can to dispense with the thought.\n\nUltimately, the media\u2019s cynicism amounts to a defense of elite corruption itself. But given that the press is now part of that corrupted order, why shouldn\u2019t the media be expected to protect it?", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-520783532.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
