Nationalist conservatives emphasize sexual morality and strong borders. During the revolution, by contrast, the central issue was the danger of monarchy. Not only Paine and Franklin but also more orthodox writers contended that the Hebrew Bible promotes skepticism toward charismatic rulers and the centralization of authority. With the growth of executive power since World War II, this lesson remains essential.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that the Bible balances a depiction of an autonomous Hebrew commonwealth with a transcendent standard of justice. \u201cIf there is a central political message for Israel throughout the Bible, it is this,\u201d writes Rabbi Meir Soloveichik. \u201cFor Israel to deserve independence, it must remember that it exists for a calling more important than independence itself.\u201d Indeed, much of the biblical narrative is devoted to Hebrews\u2019 failure to uphold their covenant.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence echoes the idea that sovereignty must serve a higher purpose. Rather than merely presenting a case against British rule of the colonies, it affirms universal truths. In an 1859 letter, Abraham Lincoln put it this way: \u201cAll honor to Jefferson \u2014 to the man who, in the concrete pressure of a struggle for national independence by a single people, had the coolness, forecast, and capacity to introduce into a merely revolutionary document, an abstract truth, applicable to all men and all times, and so to embalm it there, that to-day, and in all coming days, it shall be a rebuke and a stumbling-block to the very harbingers of re-appearing tyranny and oppression.\u201d\n\nLincoln further developed that argument following his election to the presidency. During his journey to Washington to take the oath of office, he speculated that \u201cthere must have been something more than common that those men struggled for; that something even more than National Independence; that something that held out a great promise to all the people of the world to all time to come.\u201d Americans, Lincoln concluded, are an \u201calmost chosen people\u201d dedicated to principles of freedom and civic equality.\n\nIt is understandable that conservatives \u2014 and others \u2014 have become wary of this rhetoric. Too often it has served as an excuse for costly and unnecessary wars. Americans\u2019 responsibility to oppose tyranny at home is not a calling to overthrow it abroad.\n\nAt the same time, we should resist an impulse that also afflicted the biblical Hebrews. In 1 Samuel 8, the Hebrews demand to become \u201clike all the other nations\u201d by abandoning their special obligation to God and choosing a king who fights for only them. Like Israel in its faithless moments, America is untrue to itself when we neglect individual rights and equality among citizens of various origins, faiths and creeds in favor of cohesion and power. Nationalism that opposes what is unique in the nation is not conservative. It is a contradiction in terms.", "description": "America ceases to be unique when we reject individual rights and equality among citizens of various origins, faiths and creeds.", "authors": ["Samuel Goldman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/opinion/09goldmanWeb/09goldmanWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
