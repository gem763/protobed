A report from earlier this month found that the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max (pictured)\n\nApple, Google and Samsung phones all passed the water-resistance tests, but the 11 Pro didn\u2019t survive a ride in the tumbler.\n\nThe tumbler is a rotating chamber that repeatedly drops a phone from a height of about 2.5 feet.\n\nThe phone is checked for damage after 50 drops and then again after 100.\n\nThe goal is to expose it to impacts from a wide variety of angles.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro Max made it through 100 drops with just minor scratches, but the iPhone 11 Pro display was smashed and not working properly after just 50 drops.\n\n'That said, if you buy any of these three phones, snapping on an inexpensive case is always a good idea,' Consumer Reports noted.\n\n'Even the best phones can break, and getting them fixed can be expensive.'\n\nApple also ranked the highest for fastest processor, as it boasts the cutting edge A13 Bionic chip.\n\n'Our testers also evaluated the phones\u2019 displays and found them to be exceptionally bright, though not visibly sharper than those of last year\u2019s,' shared Consumer Reports.\n\nThe firm also noted that the speakers are louder than prior models, it is suggested to connect to headphones or a wireless speaker.\n\n\u2018If you already own an iPhone XS, XS Max, or even an XR, you can probably save your money and wait,\u2019 shared Consumer Reports.\n\n\u2018Huge jumps in battery life and new cameras aside, there just might not be enough in the way of new features to justify spending $1,000 or more on a whole new phone.\u2019\n\n\u2018If you are ready for an upgrade, though, these phones are high-performing, sleek machines.\u2019\n\n\u2018And if you want to save some scratch, don\u2019t forget the $700 iPhone 11.\n\n\u2018Opt for one of those and you miss out on an OLED display, a 2X rear camera, and a superfast charger, along with crazy long battery life.
