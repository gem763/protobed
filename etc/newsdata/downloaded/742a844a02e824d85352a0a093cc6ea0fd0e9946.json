In a newly released interview, Barclays (BCS) CEO Jes Staley suggests that assumption is incorrect.\n\nStaley, who calls JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon his mentor, recounted a panel appearance by two millennial business founders at an event with many older chief executives in the audience. The millennials said, \u201cWe bet you think we don\u2019t believe in loyalty...no, you guys are wrong, we don\u2019t believe major corporations are loyal to us.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something to that,\u201d Staley tells Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer on Oct. 10. \u201cMajor corporations need to re-earn a degree of trust with people who work for us.\u201d\n\nOver half millennials plan to leave their current job within two years and just 28% plan to stay beyond five years, according to a Deloitte survey last year of 10,455 millennials. Meanwhile, a study by a career site The Muse found 58% of 8,000 \u201cnext gen professionals\u201d surveyed at the end of 2018 said they plan to change jobs this year.\n\nBut the reasons behind the sentiment are far less clear.\n\nBarclays CEO Jes Staley participates in the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit at Union West on Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019, in New York.

He has faced some notable challenges during his tenure, including a fine for his effort to unmask a company whistleblower as well as the arrival and ongoing criticism of activist investor Edward Bramson.\n\nIn the second quarter, Barclays reported $1.23 billion in net income attributable to equity holders, a year-over-year decline of 19%. The bank reportedly made cuts last month to its global workforce in an effort to offset losses in its markets division.\n\nIn light of this trust gap, Staley said he has tried to alter the way he runs Barclays, even amid a difficult stretch for the business.\n\n\u201cBarclays has gone through a massive restructuring, we had to sell a lot of business, let a lot of people go,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I have a little legacy I\u2019d like to leave, it would be to restore to the extent that I can, the sense that Barclays is loyal to the people who work there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think a lot of major businesses around the world have the same challenge,\u201d he adds.\n\nMax Zahn is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
