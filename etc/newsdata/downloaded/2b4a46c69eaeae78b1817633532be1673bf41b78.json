USA TODAY\n\nPower in professional football can be subject to many definitions.\n\nIs it the most respected and important NFL franchise?\n\nIs it the team with the strongest running game? Or the most impressive defense?\n\nOr is it a team that derives its power from just winning.\n\nAs we reach the halfway point of the 2019 season, USA TODAY Sports chose to go with what is most important above all -- teams with the best chance to win. Even saddled with a few losses, some teams just send signals that they must be reckoned with.\n\nSo with that in mind, here are the 10 most powerful teams in the National Football League:\n\nTwo major reasons the New England Patriots are the most powerful team in the NFL: head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady, here after Sunday's win over the Browns. (Photo: Greg M. Cooper, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n1. New England (8-0)\n\nThe Patriots next five opponents currently are .500 or better. It's not that New England isn't legit, but Buffalo was the only semi-decent team on its first-half schedule. But with arguably the league's most powerful defense (No. 1 in scoring defense, No. 2 in total defense) and Tom Brady leading the offense, it may not matter much who is on the schedule.\n\n2. New Orleans (7-1)\n\nSaints QB Drew Brees returned from a thumb injury with a vengeance. If running back Alvin Kamara can do same on other side of bye, is anyone going to stop them ... the officials notwithstanding?\n\n3. San Francisco (7-0)\n\nYou can probably start chiseling defensive end Nick Bosa's name onto defensive rookie of the year trophy ... and maybe defensive player of the year trophy, too. The 49ers are first in total defense and second in scoring defense. They play at Arizona on Thursday before a home game on Monday Night Football against Seattle.\n\n4. Green Bay (7-1)\n\nWhat a powerful weapon running back Aaron Jones is becoming. No Pack back in Super Bowl era had managed 159 receiving yards in a game until he did it this past Sunday. He also has eight touchdowns on the ground this season.\n\n5. Minnesota (6-2)\n\nVikings defensive end Danielle Hunter turns 25 on Oct. 29. His 48 career sacks established record for most ever for player prior to his 25th birthday. Mark Dec. 23 on your calendar: Packers at the Vikings. Could be plenty on the line in the NFL North.\n\n6. Baltimore (5-2)\n\nLamar Jackson is the only 2018 first-round QB who hasn't faced New England (yet). The other four have combined for 30.0 passer rating. His chance comes this Sunday at home.\n\n7. Indianapolis (5-2)\n\nThey Colts are among the league's most mystifying, vexing squads. Yet Indy should roll to AFC South crown. Right? Without J.J. Watt, 5-3 Houston can't catch them, right?\n\n8. Houston (5-3)\n\nEven after edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney's departure, Whitney Mercilus is putting together the best year of his career. But can he maintain momentum now that elite lineman J.J. Watt is out for the season with an injury?\n\n9, Kansas City (5-3)\n\nIt's crazy to think the Chiefs have lost three in a row at Arrowhead Stadium; yet, all things considered, you'd have to say they're in decent spot about now. Injured QB Patrick Mahomes should be returning soon, but it's unclear if that means in time for this week's game against the Vikings. He might not be back until the next week at Tennessee.\n\n10. Seattle (6-2)\n\nA season-ending knee injury to center Justin Britt could be a major blow to an offensive line that has struggled quite a bit through the years. That is not altogether good news for quarterback Russell Wilson, an early leader for league MVP. He'll need plenty of protection against the 49ers' defensive front in the Nov. 11 Monday Night game. Those teams meet again on the last day of the regular season.\n\nContributing: Nate Davis, Thomas O'Toole", "description": "Power in professional football can be subject to many definitions.
