They put it into their sizer. I flew to Aberdeen with the bag, everything was fine.\n\n'Four days later I was returning and stopped at the gate at Aberdeen airport - and I suppose one of the most crucial differences is not by Flybe staff - but by ground staff at Aberdeen airport using a sizer which wasn't identified as a Flybe sizer.\n\n'They determined that the bag wasn't complaint and to get on the flight, I had to pay them \u00a350. Let's just say I was not happy, particularly as the bag still had the compliance sticker from the flight from four days earlier.'\n\nMr Gormley said he phoned Flybe's Exeter office and also tried to argue his case through email - but with no resolution.\n\nMr Gormley said when he returned via Aberdeen Airport (pictured), he was stopped by ground staff using a sizer which wasn't identified as a Flybe sizer\n\nHe then made the step of taking the airline to the small claims court on October 10, claiming that whatever point he made the airline simple gave 'another reason to reject it'.\n\nMr Gormley argues that the 'starting position for all these organisations' is to keep saying 'no', working on the basis the complaint will just 'go away'.\n\nHe paid \u00a337 to take the fight to court, arguing that he had not simply been 'lucky' at Belfast - and 'the people in Aberdeen got it wrong'.\n\nThe judge ruled in his favour. Flybe were told to pay back the \u00a350 along with the \u00a337 court fee.\n\nThe judge ruled in Mr Gormley's favour (pictured: A container used to measure bag size)\n\nA spokesperson for the airline said: 'Flybe can confirm that it has received and is complying with the NI court and tribunal service ruling dated 10th October 2019.\n\n'The airline continues to have a generous hand baggage allowance, which since 2016, allows passengers to take on board 2 pieces of cabin baggage. This includes 1 item that does not exceed 55 x 35 x 20cm, and one smaller additional piece such as a handbag or laptop case. Any hand baggage which exceeds these stated dimensions is charged as highlight to customers during the booking process and again in all pre-flight communications.\n\n'All information can be found on Flybe website www.flybe.com\n\n'Flybe works closely with its ground handling team to regularly check that its hand baggage policy is being properly and consistently adhered to and applied.'\n\n", "description": "Declan Gormley faced off against Flybe after his bag at\u00a0George Best Belfast City Airport was approved by Flybe - but he was then charged \u00a350 for its return to Aberdeen.", "authors": ["Henry Martin For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/16/20386192-0-image-a-54_1572452989052.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
