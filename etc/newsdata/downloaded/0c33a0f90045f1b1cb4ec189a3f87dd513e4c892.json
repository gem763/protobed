(Stringer/Reuters)\n\nThe National Basketball Association announced Friday that it would not hold media availabilities for the rest of its China tour, citing the controversy surrounding Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey and his support for protests in Hong Kong, which has been met with tremendous blowback from the Chinese.\n\n\u201cThey have been placed into a complicated and unprecedented situation,\u201d the NBA said of the teams in a statement. \u201c\u2026 It would be unfair to ask them to address these matters in real time.\u201d\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers played in an exhibition game in Shanghai on Thursday in the midst of the controversy, with another game scheduled for Saturday night in Shenzhen. Earlier this week, Chinese broadcasters announced they would not be airing the games in protest over Morey\u2019s comments.\n\nNBA media sessions this past week have centered around the controversy, after NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said on Tuesday that Morey had the right to speak his mind on the issue, and that \u201cthere are consequences from his freedom of speech and we will have to live with those consequences.\u201d Players and coaches have still been wary to talk about the issue.\n\nDuring a press conference in Tokyo on Thursday, following a Houston Rockets-Toronto Raptors exhibition, CNN reporter Christina Macfarlane asked Rockets duo James Harden and Russell Westbrook if \u201cafter the events of this week and the fallout we\u2019ve seen, whether you both feel differently about speaking out in that way in the future?\u201d A Rockets team representative then shut down the question, saying \u201cexcuse me, we are taking basketball questions only,\u201d despite protests from Macfarlane.\n\nThe NBA subsequently released a statement apologizing for the handling of the situation, stating \u201cthis was inconsistent with how the NBA conducts media events.\u201d\n\nGolden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr was also asked in a press conference Thursday about the situation, and whether he had ever been asked about \u201chuman rights abuses\u201d during his previous trips to China.\n\nKerr denied the issue ever being brought up and then pivoted, saying \u201cnor has our record of human rights abuses come up either\u2026 People in China didn\u2019t ask me about, you know, people owning AR-15s and mowing each other down in a mall.\u201d", "description": "The NBA released a statement apologizing for the handling of the situation, stating \u201cthis was inconsistent with how the NBA conducts media events.\u201d", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Kevin D.
