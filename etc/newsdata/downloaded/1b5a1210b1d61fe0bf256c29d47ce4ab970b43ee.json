Per The Telegraph, out of 1,000 nursery workers surveyed, 72 percent percent said that fewer children have invisible friends than they did five years ago, the potential cause of which likely won\u2019t come as a shock. Two-thirds of those surveyed placed the blame on the growing prevalence of screens like iPads and cell phones, which kids can now turn to whenever they don\u2019t know what to do with themselves.\n\n\u201cI think that children are not allowed to be \u2018bored\u2019 any more,\u201d David Wright, the owner of Paint Pots Nursery in England, told the Daily Mail. \u201cWhen children have free time to themselves, they find something creative to do with their mind, such as forming an imaginary friend.\u201d\n\nIf imaginary friends really are endangered, the crisis demands urgent action. But it might not be as bad as it sounds. \u201cOne or two children in our nursery do have imaginary friends but they mainly come out at home, when children are alone,\u201d Wright told the Daily Mail, which leads me to believe that many nursery workers just haven\u2019t met their kids\u2019 invisible friends. But still: One or two children? I hope there are no more than three children in this nursery.\n\nAnyway, I would like to take this opportunity to tell my old imaginary friend, Sarah, that though we don\u2019t hang out like we used to, you\u2019re still real to me.\n\nStay in touch.
