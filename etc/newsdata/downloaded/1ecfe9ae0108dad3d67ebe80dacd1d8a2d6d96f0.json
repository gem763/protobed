The walkway requires multiple trips a week for power washing and city records confirm that over 100 calls were received for emergency services,' the neighbor said.\n\nBusiness owners are also up in arms as well.\n\nThe director for the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing estimates that 20,000 homeless people reside or pass through San Francisco any given year (pictured)\n\n'They come in here, they pee there, they poo there. Every day. The police cannot do anything, it\u2019s dirty and disgusting,'resident and business owner Tom Pan told the San Francisco Examiner.\n\n'In the summertime on a hot day, I can\u2019t even open my window because of the smell.'\n\nThe neighbor who erected the wall was given permission to do so by the city, but not everybody agreed with the decision.\n\nAfter some people complained, the wall was taken down.\n\nThe conversation on what to do about the alleyway will continue for Ingleside residents as a meeting to discuss the wall has been scheduled for 6pm on Wednesday inside the Ingleside Library.\n\nSome residents are suggesting a gate be put up, instead.\n\nThis latest use of 'hostile architecture' comes one month after residents in Clinton Park placed dozens of boulders on sidewalks to block the homeless from camping in front of their homes.\n\nSeveral neighbors combined a few hundred dollars to buy the boulders and placed them in a row near street curbs.\n\nA spokeswoman from the San Francisco Public Works department said the city was not involved in the boulder placement and originally said they would not remove the boulders because they weren't blocking the main walkway.\n\nResidents in Clinton Park, placed two dozen boulders (pictured) on neighborhood sidewalks in an attempt to stop homeless people from camping in front of their homes in September\n\nAdvocates said the boulders (pictured), which were eventually moved by city officials due to road safety hazard, was a 'anti-homeless architecture'\n\nThis response angered advocates who said the boulder placement was 'anti-homeless architecture'.\n\nAuthorities eventually removed the boulders after saying they posed a road safety hazard.\n\nSan Francisco, and other parts of California, are in the midst of a growing battle with a homelessness crisis.\n\nThe Tenderloin district, found in the northern part of the city, is a particular grievance for residents who want to clean up the area.\n\nThe Tenderloin district hosts a series of addicts and homeless who reportedly leave behind human waste, as well as used needles.\n\nThe city set up public toilets in an attempt to combat this and last year the formation of the 'poop patrol', a special six-person team tasked with cleaning up the feces around San Francisco, was announced.\n\nSan Francisco also funded an initiative to hire people to collect used needles off the street.\n\nThe Trump administration blasted San Francisco and other California cities for its rampant homelessness crisis (pictured) in September and have put pressure on places like San Francisco to clean up their streets\n\nThe city has faced government criticism in addition to resident outcry.\n\nPresident Donald Trump visited California in mid-September and subsequently unleashed a very public condemnation of San Francisco's homeless crisis.\n\nTrump blamed 'liberal policies' for the crisis and said city officials were allowing waste to filter through storm drains leading to the ocean.\n\n'It's a terrible situation that's in Los Angeles and in San Francisco,' Trump said of the issue.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency accused the state of California of failing to protect residents from 'degraded water.'\n\nIn a letter from Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler, he addressed Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe letter said: 'California needs to fulfill its obligation to protect its water bodies and, more importantly, public health, and it should take this letter as notice that EPA is going to insist that it meets its environmental obligations.'\n\n'If California does not step up to its delegated responsibilities, then EPA will be forced to take action.'\n\nThe letter directly linked the alleged water pollution to the homelessness crisis.\n\nHousing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson (pictured) rejected a housing aid request from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and mayors from the state's 13 largest cities\n\nAlthough the Trump administration has told San Francisco and California to clean up its act, they're unwilling to pay for it.\n\nHousing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson rejected a housing aid request from Gov. Newson and mayors from the state's 13 biggest cities.\n\nThe request asked for additional resources to fight homelessness, including 50,000 housing vouchers for the poor.\n\nCarson said: 'Your letter seeks more federal dollars for California from hardworking American taxpayers but fails to admit that your state and local policies have played a major role in creating the current crisis.'\n\nCarson implied that California's law enforcement policies, over-regulated housing market and sanctuary city policies are the root problem.", "description": "In September, Clinton Park, San Francisco, residents placed two dozen massive boulders on sidewalks to stop people from making homeless encampments outside their homes.", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/16/19792600-0-image-a-4_1571238040701.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
