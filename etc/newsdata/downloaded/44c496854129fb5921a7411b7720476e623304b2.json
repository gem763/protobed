The searches are believed to be linked to the arrest of the driver, named in reports as 25-year-old Mo Robinson, from Portadown, who is being held and questioned on suspicion of murder by Essex police.\n\nThis morning, authorities will continue their work to identify the 38 adults and one teenager found dead on Wednesday. Police are examining whether organised crime networks linked to a recent surge in people-smuggling into the UK are responsible. The lorry trailer came from Bulgaria, authorities said. Robinson is believed to have arrived in the UK via Holyhead, one of Britain\u2019s busiest ferry ports, and picked up the trailer in Essex shortly before emergency services were called.\n\nPlay Video 1:41 Essex murder investigation: CCTV shows lorry night before it was discovered \u2013 video report\n\nThe prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he was \u201cappalled by this tragic incident\u201d \u2013 the worst of its kind in Britain since the bodies of 58 Chinese people were found in a container in Dover, Kent in 2000. The case throws a spotlight on the perilous journey of asylum seekers into Europe via the Balkans. Often they end up on lorries and trucks managed by smugglers. Before yesterday\u2019s discovery in Essex, 58 migrant deaths on land in Europe had been recorded for 2019 \u2013 22 of which were from \u201cvehicle-related\u201d incidents. A further 24 people have died on the western Balkans route. Five have drowned in the Channel, and a stowaway on a plane fell to his death over London on 30 June. More than 1,000 migrants and refugees have died in the Mediterranean Sea this year, according to the UN.\n\nHauliers approached by the Guardian in Holyhead said checks on people smuggling at UK ports were often inadequate and that such an incident had been \u201ca matter of time\u201d. Drivers told of regular hazards they faced with refugees and migrants trying to climb into their vehicles. Hugh Williams, who runs the Edinburgh Castle pub opposite the Holyhead ferry port, said: \u201cDesperate people trying to escape desperate circumstances and someone has made money out of this misery. It is disgusting.\u201d\n\nRepublicans in bizarre stunt \u2013 Republicans have \u201cstormed\u201d a closed-door hearing of the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry to interrupt what they called \u201csecret\u201d proceedings. But the committees carrying out the investigation already include both Republicans and Democrats. The intervention came after Donald Trump called on Republicans to \u201cget tougher and fight\u201d on his behalf \u2013 apparently rattled by devastating testimony from the ambassador to Ukraine, William Taylor, about efforts on Trump\u2019s behalf to make US aid conditional on Kyiv\u2019s assistance in smearing Joe Biden. \u201cRepublicans are playing to an audience of one, and the president\u2019s proud of them, but we\u2019re going to continue to do all the work,\u201d said the Democratic congressman David Cicilline, a member of the House foreign affairs committee.\n\nHaving a WAB-ble \u2013 MPs on both the Labour and Conservative sides of the Commons are voicing their doubts about the idea of a general election amid the impasse over the Brexit withdrawal agreement bill (WAB). Some in Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet believe the majority of 30 achieved by the government on the second reading suggests his deal has enough support to carry it through all its stages in parliament. Meanwhile there is anxiety among Labour MPs about abandoning the idea of a Brexit referendum in favour of a pre-Christmas election, especially with the party well behind the Conservatives in recent published polls. Owen Jones says Labour should bite the bullet and agree to an election. The prime minister has told MPs he is awaiting the decision of the EU27 over whether to grant an extension before settling his next move. That decision is unlikely to come from Brussels before Friday.\n\nOil lobby\u2019s reach into EU politics \u2013 The five biggest oil and gas companies \u2013 BP, Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Total \u2013 and their industry groups have spent at least \u20ac251m (\u00a3217m) lobbying the EU over climate policies since 2010. Researchers say the figure represents the tip of the iceberg, as in some years companies made no declarations of spending in the voluntary EU transparency register. Pascoe Sabido, researcher at Corporate Europe Observatory, said the oil and gas lobby had \u201cdelayed, weakened and sabotaged EU action on the climate emergency thanks to their hefty lobby spending. A cool quarter of a billion over the last decade buys a lot of access and influence in Brussels.\u201d\n\nFacebook founder grilled \u2013 Mark Zuckerberg has been questioned by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Facebook\u2019s reluctance to ban lies in political advertising. The Democratic congresswoman\u2019s questions about whether Facebook would take down campaign ads that told lies drew extensive fudging from Zuckerberg who at times struggled to answer. Zuckerberg was appearing at a committee hearing regarding the launch of Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency project, Libra. \u201cIn order for us to make decisions about Libra, I think we need to kind of dig into your past behaviour and Facebook\u2019s past behaviour with respect to our democracy,\u201d said Ocasio-Cortez. Poppy Noor writes: \u201cAOC has shown a remarkable ability to extract energising viral moments from stale bureaucratic meetings. She turns complex political concepts into snappy soundbites and boring old politics into much-talked-about spectacle.\n\nWanted known \u2013 Coldplay has revealed the tracks of its new album, Everyday Life, by placing ads in the classified sections of newspapers around the world. The band started close to home with local papers in north Wales and Devon but also included Australia\u2019s Sydney Morning Herald, the Otago Daily Times in New Zealand and Le Monde in France. In the North Wales Daily Post, the advertisement sits alongside ads for bales of hay and a fridge-freezer. Lead guitarist Jonny Buckland tweeted: \u201cI once had a holiday job at the Daily Post, placing photos of houses for sale. I wasn\u2019t very good at it.\u201d\n\nToday in Focus podcast: Klein on the climate crisis\n\nActivist and author Naomi Klein tells Anushka Asthana that combating the climate crisis must be at the heart of an urgent restructuring of politics and the economy.

But you can make delicious food from even the most unpromising pumpkin.\u201d Naylor rounds up some enticing ideas from chefs, bakers and cookery writers.\n\nSport\n\nGeorge Ford is expected to face New Zealand in the World Cup semi-final, with Eddie Jones springing another selection surprise in a team that is probably \u201cthe tightest group of England players there has ever been\u201d, according to Manu Tuilagi. Wales, meanwhile, are confident the centres Jonathan Davies and Hadleigh Parkes will be fit for their semi-final against South Africa. J\u00fcrgen Klopp praised Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for two \u201csensational\u201d goals in a 4-1 win over Genk but admitted he was less than impressed with Liverpool\u2019s overall performance in Belgium. Frank Lampard said Chelsea had provided the blueprint for future success with their display in the 1-0 Champions League win at Ajax, which fired their hopes of qualification for the last 16.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board has insisted the Hundred will be judged a success only if it \u201cgrows the game as a whole\u201d after the controversial new cricket format came under sustained scrutiny from MPs. And five years after finally admitting female members, the R&A has made the decision to allow golfers to get ready on the premises at the Old Course by installing a women\u2019s changing room.\n\nBusiness\n\nAfter soaring 6% in two weeks of volatile trade, sterling has stabilised as Brexit appears to be in a holding pattern. The pound is trading around $1.291 and \u20ac1.159 at time of writing. Currency markets are sticking to tight ranges ahead of key central bank meetings this week and next with the eurozone, Japan and United States due to review policy. Asian shares have pulled ahead as corporate earnings and a ceasefire in northern Syria helped prop up sentiment. On Wall Street overnight the Dow and the Nasdaq added 0.2% each while the S&P 500 gained 0.3%. Tesla shares jumped 21% in after-hours trading following a surprise third-quarter profit. The FTSE is trending flat to a few points down ahead of the open.\n\nThe papers\n\nThe discovery of 39 bodies in a lorry in Essex is the main story on most of the front pages today, including the Guardian: \u201cPolice work to identify 39 people found dead in lorry\u201d, the Daily Telegraph: \u201cHuman cargo driven to frozen fate\u201d, the Mirror: \u201cThe tomb of steel\u201d and the i: \u201cDream of a new life ends in horror\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Guardian front page, Thursday 24 October 2019\n\nSeveral papers feature pictures of Mo Robinson, whom police are questioning in connection with the deaths, including the Sun: \u201c39 dead in his truck\u201d, the Times: \u201cLorry migrants froze to death\u201d and the Mail, which asks \u201cWhy were warnings ignored?\u201d saying ministers were warned about the port three years ago.\n\nThe Express features the truck on its front page, but leads on \u201cFury over EU still deciding our fate\u201d while the FT has \u201cSoftBank to force 4,000 WeWork job cuts as part of turnaround plan\u201d.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
