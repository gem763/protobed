All these alarming words made less sense to me until I looked at my city from the window of my home on the twenty-second floor. Morning, when the birdies start their day by chirping and looking for food, I sat rather despondently on my couch as all I could see was a white smoky layer, a doppelganger of fog blurring my view. My eyes tried to convince me that \u2018winter has come\u2019 but my lungs shrieked, \u201cits \u2018smog\u2019 you halfwit.\u201d Nature has failed in all its attempts to decompose the unnatural elements we have injected in the atmosphere. It won\u2019t be a surprise if I would see Delhites doing Anulom Vilom and Kapalbhati with their pollution masks on, morning strolls and exercises seem like a dream now. I feel blue to see the lush green plants on roadside turning dusty green as if they are also choking together with us. What is our future? Can we stop this or at least try to abate the effect of the venom we are breathing in every day?\n\nIn the other part of the world where a little girl, Greta Thunberg is raising concern for shielding the planet, we can at least be responsible for the city we live in. Stop brushing it aside like it is none of your business or keep slinging it on government. From this day, promise yourself that you are going to do your bit and motivate others too. Create that ripple effect. Even if you don\u2019t like, become a plant lover, have a vertical garden in your balcony, put indoor air purifying plants like Peace lily, Devils ivy and Dwarf date palm at your home, besides giving pure and fresh air they will also fill your surroundings with vivacity. And how about the idea of exchanging plant/flower pots in place of gifts this Diwali? The festival of lights will be green too! Yes, it is going to be a hassle but whenever possible start using public transport and carpools. Discourage the gardeners and other helpers to burn trash and dry waste, give them alternatives.Do educate your kids about the the concern. Use social media to blow your trumpet about the initiatives you have taken to create healthy breathing conditions in your city. #iwillsavemycity#mygreendelhiI,create hashtags for increasing awareness and building followers for the cause. Let us gift a healthy Delhi to ourselves and generations to come!", "description": "\u2018Delhi is one of the most polluted cities in the world, we are inhaling poisonous gases every single second and our lungs are rotting.\u2019 As reported by the WHO, India has the highest death rate...", "authors": ["Anjali Sharma"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Anjali-Sharma.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
