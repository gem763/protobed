Attorney General William Barr announced in July his department instead would use pentobarbital, a barbiturate, when it resumes federal executions later this year, ending a de facto moratorium on the punishment put in place by the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama.\n\nBut the special consideration given to the possibilities of fentanyl, even as federal agents were focused on seizing illegal imports of the synthetic opioid, show how much has changed since the federal government last carried out an execution nearly 20 years ago.\n\nMany pharmaceutical companies have since put tight controls on their distribution channels to stop their drugs being used in executions.\n\nAs old supply chains vanished, many states, and the federal government in turn, have been forced to tinker with their lethal recipes. They have experimented with different drugs, in some cases leading to grisly \u201cbotched\u201d executions in which the condemned prisoners have visibly suffered prolonged, excruciating deaths, viewed by some as a breach of the constitutional ban on \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishments.\n\nIn 2017, Nebraska and Nevada announced they would use fentanyl, which is 100 times more powerful than morphine, in new multi-drug execution protocols.\n\nBy 2018, the U.S. Justice Department was also examining the \u201cuse of fentanyl as part of a lethal injection protocol,\u201d according to a three-page internal memorandum from March 2018 by the director of the department\u2019s Bureau of Prisons.\n\nThe Justice Department revealed the memo\u2019s existence in an August court filing after a federal judge ordered it to produce a complete \u201cadministrative record\u201d showing how it arrived at the new pentobarbital execution protocol announced in July.\n\nThe full contents of the memo are not public. It is not known why the department decided to examine fentanyl, what supply channels were considered or why it ultimately rejected fentanyl as a protocol. The government\u2019s court filing shows the only other named drug examined as the subject of a department memo was pentobarbital, the drug it now says it wants to use in December and January to kill five of the 61 prisoners awaiting execution on federal death row.\n\nWyn Hornbuckle, a department spokesman, declined to share a copy of the memo or to answer questions about the government\u2019s execution protocol.\n\nMark Inch, who was the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 director at the time, acknowledged in a brief telephone interview writing the memo. Inch, who abruptly resigned a couple months after writing the memo, declined to answer questions, in part because he said it would be in conflict with his current role running Florida\u2019s Department of Corrections.\n\nDoctors can prescribe fentanyl for treating severe pain. In recent years, illegal fentanyl has become a common additive in bootleg pain pills and other street drugs, contributing to the tens of thousands of opioid overdose deaths in the country each year. Even tiny quantities can slow or stop a person\u2019s breathing.\n\nEarlier this year, an Ohio lawmaker proposed using some of the illegal fentanyl seized from drug traffickers to execute condemned inmates.\n\n\u2018FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG\u2019\n\nDeath penalty researchers say that just because a drug is deadly does not mean it is always appropriate as an execution drug.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019d be a surprise that the government would be looking at alternative methods of carrying out lethal injection, and fentanyl has been in the news,\u201d Robert Dunham, the director of the Washington-based non-profit group the Death Penalty Information Center, said in an interview.\n\nPlastic bags of Fentanyl are displayed on a table at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection area at the International Mail Facility at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, U.S. November 29, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Lott/Files\n\n\u201cBut there is just something fundamentally wrong about using a drug implicated in illegal activities as your method of executing prisoners.\u201d\n\nIn August 2018, Carey Dean Moore became the first person in the United States to be executed using a protocol that included fentanyl.\n\nNebraska prison officials injected him with fentanyl and three other drugs. Moore took 23 minutes to die. Witnesses said that before succumbing, Moore breathed heavily and coughed and that his face turned red, then purple.", "description": "The U.S. Department of Justice examined using fentanyl in lethal injections as it prepared last year to resume executing condemned prisoners, a then untested use of the powerful, addictive opioid that has helped fuel a national crisis of overdose deaths.", "authors": ["Jonathan Allen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429396913&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0S9", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
