Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will endorse Sanders, and a CNN report that Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib will also do so. Since the debate, Omar has officially endorsed Sanders.\n\nHe said that these endorsements will \"certainly help\" Sanders, but could also \"have some of the other candidates say: Wait a minute, is this too far left, is this too uncompromising, is it too urban, is it too internet, does the Democratic party need to find a broader audience?\"\n\nKing tweeted on Wednesday that his use of the word \"urban\" was \"nothing to do with color.\"\n\nRead more: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is backing Bernie Sanders in 2020, is the most coveted 2020 endorsement besides former presidents\n\n\"Please don't take a snippet and twist my words. I said they are leading new voices in the party but also part of the debate we saw on stage tonight .... some candidates argue parts of the party are too liberal, too urban. Was a policy point. Nothing to do with color,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Urban,\" while nominally used to refer to densely populated areas like cities, is sometimes used as a synonym for black or latinx people and communities.\n\nSome Twitter users highlighted this usage to King. One wrote: \"'urban' and 'inner cities' has always been a dog whistle for POC and you know this.\"\n\nAfter Tuesday's debate, King said that the endorsements would be a \"extension\" of what was debated on Thursday: \"A debate about not only who is going to lead the party, but where is the party going to go, which part of the party is going to lead the party into the 2020 election.\"\n\nReps. Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

There is no doubting his fundraising, there is no doubting the depths of his support across the country. But is it in the teens? Can he get it into the 20s? How do you win?\"\n\nOmar, who represents a district in Minnesota, and Tlaib, who represents Michigan, are members of a group of progressive freshman Congresswomen often referred to as \"The Squad\" alongside Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. All are women of color.\n\nThe Congresswomen have sparred with some of the older Democrats about the direction of the party, and they are more outspoken about topics like impeaching Trump \u2014 sometimes appearing to set, or at least influence, the party's agenda.\n\nNone of the Congresswomen have spoken about King's analysis, but Ocasio-Cortez did share criticism of the debate on Twitter. She retweeted Washington Governor Jay Inslee, a former presidential candidate, who said that it was \"completely inexcusable\" that there was \"Not one single question about the climate crisis.\"", "description": "CNN anchor John King mulled after Tuesday's debate on a potential gap between the party's most famous progressive freshman members and the party base.", "authors": ["Sin\u00e9ad Baker"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da6d51c4af90973ed38a893?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
