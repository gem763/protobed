(NYSE: ) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for SNV broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.\n\nThis has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 0.5% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for SNV stock.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, SNV isn\u2019t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.\n\nConsider that in the last 30 days, 4 estimates have been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.\n\nThat is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So, either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for SNV. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nBreakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit Potential\n\nThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases.
