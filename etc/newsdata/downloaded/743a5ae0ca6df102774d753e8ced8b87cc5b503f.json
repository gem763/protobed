Even the massive, multi-ton ones that can have service lives spanning a decade or more eventually just become so much space trash once they\u2019re out of fuel, or they experience some kind fo terminal mechanical failure. A new spacecraft built by Northrop Grumman and launched aboard a Russian Soyuz today (via Space.com) could change all that, however.\n\nThe MEV-1, as its known, is a satellite service spacecraft, which has the specific mission of meeting up with Intelsat 901 in orbit and lending it use of its orientation thrusters to put it back into an ideal target orbit \u2013 thus extending the useful life of the 18-year old satellite by as many as five years. Once it has succeeded in putting Intelsat 901 back on track, it\u2019s very possible the MEV-1 could do the same thing for yet another orbital satellite running low on its own propellant supply.\n\nIn fact, Northrop Grumman says that the spacecraft is itself designed for a 15-year useful life, and can dock and undock multiple times, providing \u201cwell in excess of\u201d 15-years of mission extension to geosynchronous satellites around 4,400 lbs in size while docked with said satellite.\n\nThat should mark a new era for commercial satellite operation, leading to further decreased operating costs, and therefore more access for startup and smaller companies to take part. Northrop\u2019s MEV-1 is basically a space tug, but even that can as much as double the life of some geosynchronous satellites \u2013 which means a lot more potential revenue for not too much more cost, if the MEV-1 serves multiple customers who share the cost of its development and launch. Think of it as satellite servicing-as-a-service, or a SsaaS model for space tech companies.\n\nOther satellite servicing projects are in the works, and could benefit companies like Orbit Fab, the so-called \u2018gas stations in space\u2019 startup that was a finalist in our Battlefield competition at TC Disrupt last week. Orbit Fab is working on a simple refuelling system for satellites to use in space, so that the servicing craft wouldn\u2019t need to actually dock and propel the satellite it\u2019s working with, just connect and transfer some fuel. Other potential business opportunities could lead from in-space commercial orbital spacecraft servicing, including upgrading satellites with new modules and sensors from different customers to maximize the return on the investment of their original design, build and launch.", "description": "Up until now, commercial satellites have essentially been disposable.
