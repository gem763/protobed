Jonathan Carl instead.\n\nThe misguided attack prompted the Baptist pastor to write an open letter in response to Trump, which he published on Monday.\n\n\"My first reaction was to laugh out loud at your mistake when I saw your tweet. My second response was sadness and compassion for you,\" Carl wrote. \"Our words overflow from our hearts and can quickly evidence the health or sickness of our souls. Your heart must be in a dangerous place to have such a consistent flow of defamation and disrespect towards so many.\"\n\nRead more: Virginia pastor asks God to give Trump 'wisdom' to lead US\n\nCarl described in the letter, a slew of \"intense vitriol and hatred\" from Trump supporters thinking that he was the ABC News reporter that the president targeted.\n\nHe also outlined what he learned from the experience, and what the president could also take away from it, such as exercising self-control when tweeting, apologizing more for his mistakes, being humble, and choosing kindness.\n\n\"At the end of the day, being right or wrong on social media regarding the prediction of a catastrophic weather event like Hurricane Dorian isn't the main issue,\" Carl wrote. \"Thousands of souls are suffering and they need our prayers, encouragement, and support.\"\n\nThe pastor signed off the letter as a \"lightweight husband, father, pastor, and latest Trump-tweet casualty.\"", "description": "Rev.
