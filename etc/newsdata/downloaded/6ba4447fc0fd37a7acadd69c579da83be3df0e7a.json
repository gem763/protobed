That is why a different experience, the white experience, is centred in this talk,\u201d she said.\n\nFollowing the event, Ms Crucet praised some of the \u201cvery amazing, brilliant students\u201d she met.\n\n\u201cAt the signing, we hugged & cried,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m happy to know them and also legit worried for their safety.\u201d\n\nOther students had a different reaction and used photos and videos to troll Ms Crucet on Twitter. One student sent a photo of ripped pages to Ms Crucet over Twitter.\n\n\u201cEnjoy this picture of your book!\u201d a tweet captured by the George-Anne said. \u201cHave a nice night, Jennine. :-)\u201d\n\nThat tweet and others collected by the paper were later deleted.

It makes me feel like these people make us look as a school and even as a freshman class really ignorant and racist,\u201d Carlin Blalock, a freshman music education student, told the George-Anne.\n\n\u201cJust seeing it happen, I know they didn\u2019t read the book or they didn\u2019t care. It\u2019s so disrespectful to even think about doing anything to that book because that\u2019s her life story. I wish I could have been there to do something about it.\u201d\n\nPEN America, a speech and literature advocacy group, said the book burning was \u201cdeeply\u201d disturbing in a statement.\n\n\u201cBook burning has a long history as a tactic to intimidate, silence, and denigrate the value of intellectual exchange,\u201d said Jonathan Friedman, the group\u2019s campus free speech director.\n\n\u201cStudents have the right to exercise their own freedom of expression and book burning is also a protected act of expression. But this symbolic gesture aimed not just to reject or refute ideas but to obliterate the very paper on which they were written.\u201d\n\nMr Friedman also said the university\u2019s statement did not go far enough in response.\n\n\u201cIt behooves the university to educate its students about why book burning is so inimical to open discourse and free expression.\u201d\n\nMs Crucet concluded her statement on the incident by saying that her \u201cbook began as an act of love and an attempt at deeper understanding,\u201d adding that, \u201cI hope GSU can act from the same place and work to affirm the humanity of those students who might understandably feel unsafe in the aftermath of the event and the book burning, and that the campus continues the difficult and necessary conversation that began in that auditorium.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "The white students gathered around the fire, speculating why parts of the book were not already engulfed in flames. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard cover!\u201d shouts one male student in a video amid laughs as ripped-out pages burn, torn from a novel written by a Hispanic author who had suggested white people are treated differently in society.
