We took care of one goal tonight, going 1-0, and now we want to go 5-0 for the rest of the season.\"\n\nAdams threw three touchdown as Montreal defeated the Toronto Argonauts 27-24 on Friday night at Percival Molson Stadium. It was another close affair for the Als, as has been in the case in many of their victories this season. Adams is still looking to for a more emphatic victory before the season is over.\n\n\"That's what I've been saying,\" said Adams. \"We need one of those convincing wins where it's not close. We got the win but I do think we need one of those wins. But at the end of the day, let's just keep winning.\"\n\nAdams threw 16 completions on 23 passing attempts for 249 yards along with his three scores for Montreal (9-8).\n\nWATCH | Alouettes take care of business against Argos:\n\nAls running back William Stanback reached the 1,000-yard plateau on the season, rushing for 11 carries and 49 yards in the game.\n\n\"Tonight was something special,\" Stanback said. \"A lot of backs don't get the opportunity to have 1,000 yards in this particular league. It shows what type of running game we have.\"\n\nMontreal lost receiver DeVier Posey to a high thigh bruise during the second half. The Als also lost defensive back Tommie Campbell to injury. Head coach Khari Jones said both players were okay but didn't provide more specifics on their injuries.\n\nMcLeod Bethel-Thompson threw for 342 yards on 35 completions for Toronto (3-13). He added two TD passes and a rushing touchdown.\n\nBack and forth\n\nMontreal scored the game's first ten points. Following a 36-yard field goal from Boris Bede in the first quarter, Adams threw his touchdown pass of the night to Posey to give his team a 10-0 lead in the second quarter.\n\nToronto kicker Tyler Crapigna had a 41-yard field goal to make the score 10-3. But Bede restored his team's 10-point advantage with a 40-yard field goal of his own with a little over five minutes to play in the first half. Crapigna had his second kick blocked seconds before halftime, giving Montreal a 13-3 lead heading into the break.\n\nStanback reached over 1,000 rushing yards on the season in the third quarter, when he ran for five yards on his 11th carry of the night in the opening minutes of the second half.\n\nThe Argos, once again, cut into the Alouettes lead later in the quarter. Bethel-Thompson ran a quarterback sneak into the end zone, bringing the score to 13-10.\n\nThen, with 3:04 left in the third quarter, ex-Alouette S.J. Green caught a touchdown pass from Bethel-Thompson to give the Argos the lead for the first time.\n\nSlick play call\n\nBut with 10:26 to go in the fourth, Adams threw a screen pass to Jeremiah Johnson. The 32-year old weaved his way around defenders, leading to a 45-yard score and a three-point lead. Later in the quarter, Adams threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Quan Bray to give Montreal a 10-point lead again.\n\n\"Khari [Jones] called a great play,\" Johnson said. \"Seen two of my guys blocking, cut back, just happened to look back to my left and it was wide open. Nothing but green. And then I just turned it on. Tried to run as fast as I can.\"\n\nThe Argonauts would draw within three points with 1:14 to play as Bethel-Thompson threw his second touchdown pass of the night to Chandler Worthy. Crapigna attempted a game-tying field goal with two seconds left in the game, but his kick was well short of the uprights.", "description": "Quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. threw three touchdown passes as the Montreal Alouettes defeated the Toronto Argonauts 27-24 on Friday night at Percival Molson Stadium.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5327510.1571450228!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/antigha-stanback-101819.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
