Both were fathers. Both were black. The first man, Deshawn Lamont Coley, had written request after request begging for his asthma inhaler\u2014accurately predicting that his sporadic access to it was putting his life at risk. The second, Stephen Antwan Patterson, was found without a pulse about a week after he was booked with a blood-pressure reading that would likely have led any free person to the emergency room. The deaths came at an uncomfortable time for Forsyth County: Patterson died just four weeks before the Board of Commissioners sat down to decide whether to renew a contract with the private health-care company that had cared for the two men, then called Correct Care Solutions and now Wellpath, or sign with someone else. What might have been a routine board meeting turned tense. \u201cCorrect Care Solutions makes the sheriff\u2019s office look bad, makes the county look bad, makes the Department of Health look bad, and makes us commissioners look bad,\u201d Everette Witherspoon, then a commissioner, declared. \u201cSo many people have blown up my phone about some of these incidents that it doesn\u2019t even make any sense.\u201d The following week, a regional vice president from Correct Care Solutions, Bill Kissel, showed up to try to massage the situation. It didn\u2019t go well. Commissioners posed a series of questions. Had the company lost any lawsuits? \u201cI am not aware, Commissioner,\u201d Kissel replied, adding that legal claims are often settled before a trial. When would the county see the company\u2019s plan for resolving issues that may have contributed to the deaths? \u201c[That] would not be made public,\u201d Kissel said. \u201cIn those eight years [that Correct Care Solutions had the contract for Forsyth County], how many deaths have we had in the jail? Do you know?\u201d Witherspoon asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know offhand, sir,\u201d Kissel said.\n\nIn my review of Forsyth County\u2019s videotaped meetings and in interviews with several commissioners, sheriff\u2019s-office staff, and community members, it was clear that few seemed totally comfortable continuing to work with Correct Care Solutions. People entering jails are not necessarily society\u2019s healthiest, often detoxing from substances or dealing with mental illness; a death in custody may not imply wrongdoing. But Patterson\u2019s and Coley\u2019s deaths were not a first in the jail under the care of the contractor. Two legal settlements were reached\u2014one for $180,000, and the other for an undisclosed amount, about six months earlier, according to the Triad City Beat\u2014in the deaths of two other inmates, Dino Vann Nixon in 2013 and Jennifer McCormack Schuler in 2014. But Forsyth\u2019s commissioners had exactly zero alternatives. After an exhaustive search for a contractor, starting almost an entire year earlier, the only entity that formally offered its services was Correct Care Solutions. So the board voted to award it an estimated $13.2 million contract for three more years. Only Witherspoon and one other commissioner voted against it. When I asked Patterson\u2019s mother, Deborah Miles, whether she thought the jail\u2019s health care should be privately run, her reaction was immediate: \u201cNo! No! No, no, no. \u2019Cause it just becomes a meat market, just a moneymaking thing.\u201d Her son was in jail over a couple of hundred dollars in unpaid child support, she added. \u201cThe horrible reason people are there is because they don\u2019t have money to bail themself out for simple stuff! And so you get stuck there,\u201d she said. Patterson\u2019s eldest son and Coley\u2019s mother are separately suing the contractor. (The company declined to comment on ongoing litigation.) Most people held in jails haven\u2019t been convicted, and as of the end of 2017, black people were jailed at a rate of more than three times that of white people. Their charges, too, are often minor: traffic offenses, marijuana possession, petty theft. Put another way, every day, thousands of legally innocent people are stopped, searched, cuffed, booked, examined, locked up, and upended from their routines, families, homes, and jobs\u2014all without their own medical supplies and prescriptions\u2014to endure a few days, or more, in a jail. Many will eventually see their charges dismissed or pleaded down, if they are charged at all. But the correctional health-care industry depends on them. In a financial disclosure to investors, one publicly traded company, later acquired by Correct Care Solutions, listed reduced sentences, decriminalization, and relaxed enforcement among its top business risks.\n\nIn the months since Forsyth found itself with a single bidder for its inmate-health-care contract, the range of possible providers has shrunk even further. Last fall, H.I.G. Capital, a private-equity firm with more than $34 billion in equity capital under management, acquired Correct Care Solutions and combined it with a smaller company, Correctional Medical Group Companies. They named the combined company Wellpath. Kip Hallman, Wellpath\u2019s president, told me the firm currently serves about 10 percent of the counties in the nation. That number might not seem large, but without knowing which counties, exactly\u2014a detail the company doesn\u2019t disclose\u2014it\u2019s impossible to say how many inmates it serves. What I do know is that Wellpath is now estimated to be the country\u2019s largest correctional health-care company. It works in about 550 jails, prisons, and behavioral-health settings in 36 states across the United States and Australia, and cares for nearly 300,000 patients on a daily basis. There is no standard way to compare Wellpath\u2019s performance with its competitors, firms such as Corizon Health and Armor Correctional Health Services. But Wellpath\u2019s rapid ascent is emblematic of America\u2019s booming $40 billion market for private correctional services of all kinds. Its predecessors, Correct Care Solutions and Correctional Medical Group Companies, are stark examples of the surging growth that\u2019s possible with private-equity backing. In its newly grafted, sized-up form, Wellpath is at the beginning of another cycle, with bigger investors and bigger stakes than ever. To deliver returns to its investors, it must continue to grow.\n\nThere\u2019s very little research on the country\u2019s correctional health-care market. To gain an understanding of the significance of Wellpath\u2019s rise, I reviewed the minutes and videotape of dozens of county board meetings, pored over hundreds of pages of contracts and proposals, and, with help from Atlantic researchers, contacted more than 150 sheriff\u2019s offices nationwide. Hallman responded in writing to most of my questions and followed up with a phone interview. What I\u2019ve found is striking. Just a handful of firms serve the nation\u2019s largest jails. A contractor deemed problematic can\u2019t always be replaced. And once jails go private, it\u2019s not necessarily easy to go back. With health care, lack of choice isn\u2019t just a market problem, but a factor in the quality of the care patients receive. The Sacramento Bee found that, over a 10-year period ending in 2014, people in custody at California county jails serviced by one private contractor died of suicide or drug overdose at a rate about 50 percent higher than at other county jails when adjusted for population. That contractor later became part of Wellpath, which disagrees with the Bee\u2019s findings.\n\nThe H.I.G. fund that holds Wellpath plans to create value through \u201cgrowth, performance improvement and synergistic add-on acquisitions,\u201d according to the marketing jargon of a pitch to investors. The captain of one jail put it to me in more colorful terms: \u201cThe big dogs keep buying up the puppies.\u201d Wellpath\u2019s clients aren\u2019t thrilled. \u201cWhat if [Wellpath] walked away? Where would we be, right? So knowing that this is a symbiotic relationship: I need them\u2014hopefully, they need me, right?\u201d Bobby F. Kimbrough Jr., the sheriff of Forsyth County, told me. But, he conceded, the balance of power isn\u2019t exactly equal. \u201cIf you\u2019re the only dance in town, you can pretty much call your own shots,\u201d he said. I. America\u2019s roughly 3,200 jails held an average total of 731,300 people a day in 2016, and admitted more than 10 million people that year. The system is big and fragmented, and really, it\u2019s not much of a system at all. Unlike prisons, which are run by state or federal agencies for people with longer sentences, jails are generally a local affair, often administered by sheriff\u2019s offices. Since companies like Wellpath first started popping up in the late 1970s, they have figured out how to draw a profit from jails. They get involved when a jurisdiction issues a request for proposals (RFP), a standard government process for inviting contractors to bid on anything from construction projects to garbage pickup. Now more than half of Wellpath\u2019s business comes from jails. Jails are an attractive sector, according to Moody\u2019s Investor Service, because they involve higher margins compared with prisons.\n\nOne of the main services these companies provide is not medical care at all, but legal protection. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners\u201d was a violation of their constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Private firms thus helpfully offer to take the legal risk off localities\u2019 shoulders, offering, in one company\u2019s words, \u201csafe and defensible care\u201d (though, as Forsyth and others have learned, the legal risk is not gone). Read: Does bad health care constitute cruel and unusual punishment? Correctional care is good business, especially as more counties have moved to privatize. In 1996, the industry\u2019s largest company\u2014which, after a merger in 2011, now goes by the name Corizon\u2014was bringing in about $200 million in revenue, according to The New York Times. Wellpath\u2019s new owner, in a press release, said the combined company is expected to bring in about $1.5 billion annually. Corizon\u2019s revenue was pegged at about $1 billion in 2017, after several years of decline, according to estimates by PrivCo, a research firm. There is no systematic federal database of how jails provide health care\u2014whether publicly, through a contract with a local hospital network, or with a for-profit correctional health-care company such as Wellpath. The National Commission on Correctional Health Care, an accrediting body for jails and prisons, told The New Yorker that about 70 percent of the jails it inspects contract for medical care. To get a sense of how much of the market Wellpath and its competitors control, I sent a list of questions to the nation\u2019s 50 largest sheriff\u2019s offices. Forty-six responded with answers. Together, they care for about 132,000 inmates on a given day. Wellpath\u2019s name stood out as by far the most common provider, contracting with 17 of the 27 offices that use a correctional health-care company for the bulk of their care. Several other companies came up once or twice each: Corizon, Armor, NaphCare, and Centurion Managed Care. A few others worked with regional firms. (One office refused to answer my questions about inmate health care without a Freedom of Information request; a Wellpath employee subsequently denied it on the grounds that the appropriate department had no relevant records.) The largest jails, such as Cook County\u2019s in Chicago, tended to provide care in partnership with a local hospital system or the county\u2019s health department.\n\nAtlantic researchers and I contacted every sheriff\u2019s office in North Carolina\u2014100 in all. The companies that formed Wellpath had both held contracts in the state, and I wanted to get a sense of the combined company\u2019s market share now. Thirty-seven offices spoke to us. Almost all contracted for their inmates\u2019 care. A firm called Southern Health Partners held more contracts than Wellpath, though Wellpath works with many of the state\u2019s most populous counties. A few local providers also cropped up. The industry\u2019s consolidation is \u201cscary,\u201d said Major Shon Crisp, a jail administrator in Cherokee County, which used to work with a regional contractor before it was folded into Wellpath. He said he was unsure what he would do without his current contractor, Southern Health Partners. Many states in the U.S. are without jail-inspection programs, and there is no national agency charged with systematically ensuring the quality of health care. The U.S. Department of Justice has the power to investigate possible civil-rights violations of the nation\u2019s inmates, but it\u2019s very rarely exercised. In the past two fiscal years, the department\u2019s Civil Rights Division has opened only two investigations in the nation\u2019s several thousand jails and prisons related to health care. One alleged that a jail in Virginia, which contracts with Wellpath, was providing constitutionally deficient medical and mental health care. (Hallman wrote that the company was in compliance in \u201call areas\u201d as of January 2019.) The other is ongoing. Because there are no mandatory national standards, jail administrators can decide what care they think is good enough to meet the Supreme Court\u2019s standards, said Carolyn Sufrin, an ob-gyn at Johns Hopkins University and the author of Jailcare, a book based on her research and experience as a physician in a San Francisco county jail. \u201cThe only de facto oversight system we have is litigation,\u201d she said. All told, for many inmates, the only means of recourse\u2014after filing a grievance slip\u2014is to sue.\n\nWellpath likely knows more about jail health care\u2014and the changes prompted by its business model\u2014than any government agency in the country. Yet it considers basic information, including health-care policies, training protocols, and its client list, to be trade secrets. In a proposal sent to one county several months before Wellpath was unveiled, Correct Care Solutions asserted that its litigation history was a trade secret. The cases filed against it are a matter of public record, but \u201cwithout exhaustive efforts,\u201d the company pointed out, \u201cit would be nearly impossible\u201d to compile a complete list. To find out where it has been sued in state court, you would have to call every county clerk in the nation\u2014more than 3,200 in all. In considering Wellpath\u2019s history, decision makers tend to look at federal lawsuits, which can be accessed online. There, information of a certain kind is plentiful. Wellpath\u2019s predecessor, Correct Care Solutions, had been sued at least 1,395 times in federal courts over the past decade, according to a document published by the Project for Government Oversight. Some of the lawsuits are surely frivolous. \u201cWe are being sued right now by somebody who says that when they came to jail, they had a million dollars in a box, and that box is missing,\u201d Dudley Watts, Forsyth County\u2019s longtime manager, told me. But Jos\u00e9 Saldana, the director of Release Aging People in Prison, pointed out that it costs money to file a civil-rights claim. In New York, where Saldana was incarcerated for 38 years, the price tag for prisoners to assert their right to adequate care is at least $350. \u201cI don\u2019t know of anybody who got $350 to throw away in the cage,\u201d he said. Regardless, local governments are apparently disregarding whatever worries the lawsuits might raise, because they keep signing contracts with Wellpath\u2014with seven local governments in 2019 so far, according to Hallman. Likewise, it does not seem to matter that \u201csubstandard care\u201d on the part of the company has allegedly led to preventable deaths, according to a recent report by CNN. Wellpath \u201cfundamentally disagree[s] with most of the assertions\u201d in CNN\u2019s reporting, Hallman wrote, disputing that there was any pattern of poor care. \u201cWhile in the majority of these incidents, we believe our clinicians provided appropriate care, in some of them our clinicians used poor judgment or made mistakes, as all humans do,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn June, three days after the CNN report was published, the Westchester County, New York, Board of Legislators sat down to discuss a renewal of its contract with Wellpath. The board met just a day after a settlement was brokered with the family of Rashad McNulty, 36, who died of a heart attack in the county jail in 2013, after a Correct Care Solutions nurse accused him of faking his symptoms. In 2018, the county put out an RFP for the health-care contract at the Westchester County Jail, located about an hour\u2019s drive from Midtown Manhattan. As The Journal News first reported, only Wellpath and a subsidiary of NaphCare, a firm based in Birmingham, Alabama, responded. At a hearing, Damon Maher, a county legislator, vigorously questioned the county\u2019s head jailer about the CNN report and other news stories. (\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I get a little emotional about people dying in their puke and in their piss!\u201d Maher huffed when chastised for speaking out of turn.) Joseph Spano, the county\u2019s correction commissioner, acknowledged that the media reports were disturbing\u2014but suggested the jail would do no better with its one alternative to Wellpath. \u201cYou go and Google NaphCare, and you are going to see similar and alike stories,\u201d Spano said. Westchester opted to renew its contract with Wellpath. \u201cWhile we certainly do consider things like litigation histories and other national stories of interest, our main focus is our patients, [and] we know that we\u2019re getting a good level of care,\u201d Justin Pruyne, the deputy commissioner of correction, told me. But Maher told me he still has questions: What were the jail\u2019s statistics on suicides and attempted suicides before and after Wellpath? What were the mortality rates? And what\u2019s being done differently since \u201cthe McNulty disaster\u201d?\n\nII. At one point before it was rebranded as Wellpath, Correct Care Solutions put a human-resources employee in charge of supervising a nurse educator. By way of explanation for someone with no medical training taking on such a charge, she said in a deposition: \u201cWe were a small company that grew really fast.\u201d That growth took off in 2010, when two private-equity firms invested in the company, and it proceeded to buy up several competitors. In 2018, H.I.G. Capital stepped in, buying Correct Care Solutions and combining it with another jail-health-care company in its portfolio. The fund in which H.I.G. holds Wellpath is expected to reap \u201cattractive\u201d returns for its investors, according to a heavily redacted pitch book I acquired through a public-records request. The possible scale of those returns, however, is unclear. Several pages discussing the firm\u2019s \u201cinvestment performance\u201d are covered by large black boxes. But generally, the goal for firms such as H.I.G. is to double or triple their money from the time of the initial investment to when an asset is sold. The company\u2019s strategy for building value for its investors, Hallman said, is not to reduce spending at individual facilities, but rather to do good-quality work and keep signing new contracts. In his written responses, Hallman added that the company expects to grow with \u201cvery limited reliance\u201d on future acquisitions, but didn\u2019t rule them out. H.I.G. did not respond to multiple requests for comment over several weeks. Hallman pointed out that while members of H.I.G. serve on the parent entity\u2019s board of managers, responsibility for the day-to-day operations is held by the Wellpath management team.\n\n\u201cI think [H.I.G.\u2019s] entire strategy is probably to build a monopoly,\u201d said Bianca Tylek, the executive director of Worth Rises, a nonprofit that advocates against the privatization of corrections. She also pointed out that the entire correctional health-care market has been consolidating for about 10 years. Not all insiders agree\u2014a Moody\u2019s report on Wellpath called the industry \u201cvery fragmented\u201d\u2014but none were keen to talk about the industry. More than a dozen financial analysts and investment bankers either did not return my calls or, like Moody\u2019s, agreed to be interviewed and later declined. What matters, though, is that Wellpath is poised to continue growing its market share when some jails are already hurting for choice. \u201cConsolidation begets further consolidation,\u201d said Sally Hubbard, the director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute. \u201cPrivate equity is known for rolling up entire industries. Their strategy is to make industries and companies ruthlessly efficient and to extract more revenue from the business than there was before they acquired it \u2026 And that\u2019s not really ideal when you\u2019re talking about health care.\u201d (Alvaro Dominguez) )\u201cAt a personal level,\u201d Hallman told me, \u201cwe don\u2019t want people to be incarcerated.\u201d But as long as imprisonment is a fact of American life, inmates will need care. One shouldn\u2019t read too much into the disclosure by a public correctional company that reduced incarceration counts as a business risk, he said. \u201cPersonally and for our team, I don\u2019t think any of us worry about that.\u201d Wellpath\u2019s purpose, he told me, is to serve marginalized patients. Despite the mission, some of his clients don\u2019t like that the company makes money off it, I pointed out. Hallman said he wouldn\u2019t challenge their moral views, but stands for something else: \u201cI think we do this work better than most counties who do it themselves.\u201d As a private firm, Wellpath has no obligation to share with the public how much money it makes, and Hallman wouldn\u2019t give me details on what he or the company\u2019s CEO earns. But if clients asked, would he share the profit margins with them? \u201cTypically not,\u201d Hallman told me. Some do request detailed cost information, which would give a sense of the company\u2019s takeaway, and \u201cit\u2019s never embarrassing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not Google; we\u2019re not making crazy amounts of money. We make a little bit of money at every site.\u201d In fact, the profit margin is less than what most people would expect, Hallman told me. When I pressed for details, Hallman turned the question around. \u201cWhat would you expect somebody like us would earn?\u201d he asked me. \u201cProbably like 9, 10 percent,\u201d I ventured. \u201cOkay. Not far off,\u201d he said. \u201cIs that crazy?\u201d I asked, trying to calibrate his response. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not far off,\u201d he said.\n\nRead: Private equity deconstructed Some of Wellpath\u2019s customers have noticed changes since private equity got involved, and not just in their contractor\u2019s shifting name. Captain Sean Stewart, the corrections-bureau division commander with the Pima County Sheriff\u2019s Department in Tucson, Arizona, told me that when his county worked with a firm called Conmed, there was a reliably personal touch. After the company was bought by Correct Care Solutions, that largely went away. \u201cIt feels to me like when they get bigger, it\u2019s more about the money than the service. It seems like if I\u2019m short five or six nurses, the larger the company, the less in a hurry they were to try and hire those nurses,\u201d he told me. In a 2015 federal contract audit of the Reeves County Detention Center in Texas, where one of Wellpath\u2019s predecessors was contracted, the DOJ found there may have been a \u201cpotential financial incentive\u201d for the company to leave positions vacant\u2014as it did in 34 months of a 37-month period\u2014because it was paid more for the required positions than it was forced to pay back for each one it left unfilled. \u201cWe never intentionally understaff to improve our financial results,\u201d wrote Hallman, pointing to market factors outside the company\u2019s control. The Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ, in their role as federal regulators, have not prevented Wellpath\u2019s consolidation of the marketplace. Wellpath\u2019s \u201ccombination was reviewed by the DOJ and the FTC through the Hart-Scott-Rodino process, and these agencies allowed the transaction to be completed,\u201d Hallman wrote, referring to the federal requirement that large mergers and acquisitions be flagged for review by regulators before closing. (The DOJ told me that the FTC handled the deal; the FTC declined to comment.) That choice may have more to do with the government\u2019s limited resources than with the company\u2019s behavior, however. Regulators have to pick their battles, said Cory Capps, a partner with Bates White Economic Consulting who is focused on health care and who previously worked with the DOJ\u2019s antitrust division. Capps told me that a strong antitrust case often features head-to-head competition between the merging firms, a limited number of other competitors, and high barriers for entering the market\u2014exactly the circumstances when H.I.G. acquired Correct Care Solutions to create Wellpath. By then, H.I.G. was already the owner of Correctional Medical Group Companies, a firm offering similar services\u2014so similar, in fact, that I found seven states in which the two firms directly competed for contracts before the acquisition. In at least two RFPs, the companies were the only two firms to bid. In writing and in our interview, Hallman rejected any characterization of Wellpath as a monopoly, and said the companies\u2019 combination had no major impact on the market.\n\nWellpath\u2019s corporate structure apparently tripped up its employees in one case. To one client, Wellpath\u2019s accounts-receivable department wrote: \u201cAs you may be aware, Correct Care Solutions, LLC recently merged with Correctional Medical Group Companies, Inc. to create Wellpath LLC.\u201d About a month later, the county received a strange follow-up. \u201cAlthough the two companies share a common ultimate owner,\u201d Omar Mossallati, Wellpath\u2019s director of corporate counsel, wrote, \u201cplease be advised that Correct Care Solutions, LLC has not, at any time, merged with Correctional Medical Group Companies, Inc. to create Wellpath LLC.\u201d Instead, he wrote, Correct Care Solutions opted to change its name to Wellpath, and Wellpath and Correctional Medical Group Companies operate separately. The term to use is combination, Hallman said; they are separate entities that share a management team. \u201cWe are one company,\u201d he told me. \u201cOr, how do I say this right\u2014we don\u2019t work for one company, but we work for one united purpose.\u201d No formal merger is planned. The legalistic message seems to contradict the company\u2019s new branding. In a video on Wellpath\u2019s website, Jorge Dominicis, the company\u2019s CEO, formerly of Correct Care Solutions, sits with Hallman, who ran Correctional Medical Group Companies before the creation of Wellpath. Both are well dressed, but casual; in suit jackets, but with their top shirt button undone. It\u2019s friendly, approachable. \u201cWellpath is a better organization than either the two organizations were on their own,\u201d says Hallman. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says Dominicis, nodding. \u201cThe resources of both of these organizations complement each other, make us stronger as one organization\u2014more expertise, more opportunity to cross-utilize best practices\u2014and I think people who work and do what we do are passionate. This is, as I\u2019ve said before, missionary work,\u201d Dominicis says.\n\nIII. Forsyth County\u2019s 1,016-bed jail is a ruddy, block-long building that matches the color of the red clay earth where it sits, surrounded by the government offices, courthouses, and fuchsia-bloomed crape myrtles of downtown Winston-Salem. From the jail, walk a few blocks northeast, and you\u2019ll arrive at the Wake Forest Innovation Quarter, a mixed-use research center built in the old R. J. Reynolds Tobacco complex. The quarter is bordered with a cocktail bar, luxury loft apartments, a High Line look-alike, and the Wake Forest School of Medicine, the teaching branch of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, which provides the jail\u2019s off-site, emergency care. About a month after her son, Stephen Patterson, died in the county jail, Miles attended the meeting in which the commissioners debated the single bid for the inmates\u2019 health care. Miles wanted to know how hard the county had worked to scout a local provider. With Wake Forest training doctors just a few minutes\u2019 walk from the jail, why wouldn\u2019t it take the contract? Watts, the county manager, told me the county tried to persuade local providers such as Wake Forest to bid on it. \u201cWe are a medical community, and we ought to be able to figure out how not to have to go to a big, multistate national provider,\u201d he said. But there were no takers. Wake Forest did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Like Miles, Fleming El-Amin, the other Forsyth County commissioner who voted no, wanted a local contractor. Not only was the company getting too big, he told me, but it\u2019s easier to hold accountable someone who\u2019s your neighbor. He dismissed the company\u2019s altruistic arguments. \u201cIt was a sales pitch, you know. I said, \u2018Y\u2019all quit lying.\u2019 It\u2019s all profit motives, it\u2019s not a goodwill mission, it\u2019s not a community-development issue,\u201d he told me. El-Amin said he didn\u2019t know the county was contracting for inmate health care when he first took office in early 2017. He assumed the county did it. He set about researching Correct Care Solutions, starting with Google\u2014many a local official\u2019s best source on its bidders. \u201cI was shocked they were such a large company,\u201d he recalled. El-Amin felt the single response to the county\u2019s RFP wasn\u2019t accidental. \u201cSomething else is happening. This state is too big for one company to have that kind of domination,\u201d he said.\n\n(Alvaro Dominguez)\n\nBefore Wellpath was created, Correct Care Solutions had been the sole bidder on at least five RFPs, according to media reports and county government records I found published online. That said, many RFPs are very competitive, especially because the opportunity to compete comes up only every few years. They often elicit four bidders. \u201cCompetition is alive and well,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a single bid that I\u2019ve been a part of where we were the only bidder,\u201d Hallman later elaborated. Some lawyers I spoke with wondered whether this competition might be bad for the quality of inmates\u2019 health care, as the selection criteria of RFPs tend to focus on price, not quality. Or as Saldana, the nonprofit director, put it, \u201cWhen they do a bidding, they get the lowest bidder, so that company has to keep the costs down. Just the way capitalism works alone would tell me that this might not be a good idea for us.\u201d\n\nMacomb County, Michigan, received one bid in response to its RFP in 2015. It was the year after David Stojcevski, jailed for failing to appear in court for a traffic infraction, died in the county jail. Over 17 days, Stojcevski, 32, lost close to 50 pounds during withdrawal from prescribed benzodiazepines and opiates under the care of Correct Care Solutions. And it was Correct Care Solutions that submitted the single bid, though four entities came to a pre-bid meeting and tour. Questioned by Detroit\u2019s Local 4, Macomb County Sheriff Anthony Wickersham told a reporter: \u201cWe had one bid. This is the contract. This is the company. It\u2019s within our budget.\u201d Wickersham declined an interview request, but a staffer in the county\u2019s purchasing department was willing to take a guess at why only one contractor followed through with a bid: \u201cMaybe they saw they [Correct Care Solutions] were there, and got scared away. I don\u2019t know.\u201d IV. Wholesale prison privatization has become a national political issue. New York has divested nearly $10 million of state pension funds from Geo Group and CoreCivic, the country\u2019s heavyweight private prison operators, and largely banned them from the state. Entities as disparate as the American Federation of Teachers and JPMorgan Chase have worked to lessen their financial involvement. But conversations have largely avoided the question of whether private companies should provide correctional services, whether health care, food, or telephone calls. Companies like Wellpath are privatizing huge swaths of jail operations, but they are doing so quietly. Wellpath presents itself as a \u201chealthcare company caring for under-served patients,\u201d and writes on its website that it\u2019s not in the \u201cbusiness of incarceration.\u201d But is a jail still a public institution if key decision makers are employees of a private-equity-backed company beholden to its investors?\n\nSome counties are beginning to question the move to go private, only to find it\u2019s not so easy to go back. In 2013, after struggling for years to retain health-care staff at the downtown jail and the Milwaukee County House of Correction in Franklin, Wisconsin, a judge forced the county to privatize the inmates\u2019 care. But 2016 was a jolt. Terrill Thomas, 38, died of dehydration in the jail after correctional staff had shut off the water in his cell. The county completed an audit in 2018 and found that Armor, the medical contractor for both facilities, had been routinely understaffing the jail and the House of Correction. (An Armor spokesperson said the company \u201cheld a difference of opinion\u201d about its staffing levels.) \u201cThis is a core function. This is not laundry service,\u201d Theodore Lipscomb Sr., chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, said at a finance-and-audit committee meeting in late 2018, as the county\u2019s contract with Armor was set to end. \u201cThis is health care for thousands of people who are in your custody. You must get that right,\u201d he added. On the table was a resolution he\u2019d put forward to affirm the desire of the county board to return to publicly delivered care. The board voted in favor a week later. Lipscomb wanted the county to switch back immediately, he explained to me, but was told it would take two years to build the capacity. There are a few big hurdles, including the up-front investment needed to build an in-house program (and pay a contractor at the same time). The county will also have to pay for expensive legal insurance and figure out how to hire staff amid a shortage of nurses in the state. In the meantime, the county has switched to Wellpath. Bobby F. Kimbrough Jr., the sheriff of Forsyth County, came into office knowing he wanted to do something about Wellpath. (Hunter Laughlin / Courtesy of Forsyth County Sheriff\u2019s Office) Sheldon Wasserman, a county supervisor, is also a physician and member of the Wisconsin Medical Examining Board. He wants to return to publicly run care, but has doubts the county will be able to afford it. \u201cHealth care today is not like health care 20 years ago,\u201d he told me. One particularly difficult hurdle for the county, he explained, would be getting its hands on an electronic medical-records system. That cost alone would be millions of dollars. Wellpath and other correctional companies tend to build their own, unlike many of the nation\u2019s hospitals and clinics. \u201cThese companies do take advantage of governments that don\u2019t understand [medicine],\u201d Wasserman told me. (Wellpath believes this concern is unwarranted, because people with health-care experience serve on the selection committees of local governments.) \u201cIt\u2019s tough for them to get to break into the industry, but once they\u2019re in the industry, they\u2019re gonna fly\u2014they\u2019re gonna make money,\u201d he added. Asked whether he trusts Wellpath, Wasserman replied, \u201cI trust them as far as I can throw \u2019em, and I can\u2019t throw that far.\u201d\n\nMilwaukee County\u2019s administration is currently developing a possible model for self-operation. But if it wants to go back to publicly delivered care by 2021, when its initial contract with Wellpath is up, the county needs to allot the money for the 2020 budget cycle. That\u2019s due to be hammered out this fall. In the meantime, the county is monitoring Wellpath\u2019s operations, contracting with an external consulting organization for added muscle\u2014something it never did with Armor. V. When I met Kimbrough, the Forsyth County sheriff, he was only a few days out from major shoulder surgery. His right hand was bandaged around the thumb, where his surgeon had cut into it. To greet me, he outstretched his left hand to grasp the fingers of my right. He was technically off the clock, but was still getting in a few hours of work, dressed in a crisp white shirt, a dotted pink tie with a clip, and silver cuff links. Kimbrough was elected to his post for the first time in December 2018, after Coley\u2019s and Patterson\u2019s deaths, and the single bid. On the campaign trail, he kept hearing there was something seriously wrong with the health care at the jail. And so, after his swearing-in, ousting Wellpath was at the top of his to-do list. \u201cI was ready to fire them,\u201d Kimbrough told me. \u201cI came in like, \u2018Either y\u2019all gonna fix this, or I\u2019m gonna find somebody else,\u2019 not knowing there\u2019s nobody else to find. I looked around and came to my senses and realized, Let\u2019s rethink this. This ain\u2019t really as bad as they making it out to be,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen his efforts to work with the company\u2019s regional representative stalled\u2014\u201cI grew up in the microwave era; I want it now,\u201d Kimbrough said with a laugh\u2014he took a new approach. He walked the half block from his office to the jail and asked a Wellpath employee for the telephone number for the company\u2019s head office. To the person who picked up, he said, \u201cI want to speak to the man that calls the shots.\u201d In March, Dominicis, the company\u2019s CEO, and two other representatives came to Winston-Salem for a meeting. Kimbrough sat them down with about a dozen members of his command staff. \u201cWe\u2019re an unhappy customer,\u201d he recalled telling them. He reeled off complaints: Positions were going unfilled, and staff members were making errors distributing medications. \u201cWe just was throwing rocks at him. I actually felt bad,\u201d Kimbrough said. But Dominicis \u201cwalked out like a champion,\u201d Kimbrough said, and gave him his cellphone number. Kimbrough said he\u2019s since seen a big improvement with the staffing issues and their relationship with Wellpath overall. Also helping was a public-health nurse the county had installed to monitor Wellpath\u2019s compliance with its contract. Previously, the sheriff\u2019s office checked only whether the company was billing the correct amount, Major Robert Slater, the detention-bureau commander, told me, spotting errors such as a mistaken payment for a federal inmate\u2019s care or getting billed twice for an ER visit. Lindsay Novacek, the public-health nurse, who has a doctorate in nursing practice, now tracks 11 \u201ckey clinical indicators,\u201d which were written into the contract in 2017. \u201cShe holds Wellpath to the fire,\u201d the jail\u2019s commander of operational services, Captain Charlene Warren, told me. (Novacek was more diplomatic.)\n\nFew jail administrators seek independent monitoring, Marc Stern, a former medical director of the Washington State prison system and a faculty member at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Health, told me. \u201cThey forget the private company doesn\u2019t have a fiduciary responsibility to the sheriff\u2014they have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders,\u201d Stern said. And few can hold their contractor liable for lapses. In a study of 81 RFPs for jail health care, the Pew Charitable Trusts found that less than a third included any performance requirements or penalties for failing to meet them. Forsyth modeled its monitoring program on Shelby County in Tennessee, whose officials declined interview requests, but who also found themselves with Correct Care Solutions after receiving a single bid. Stewart, the Arizona jail captain and an instructor with the National Institute for Jail Operations, said he tells jail administrators that they can\u2019t just shake hands with their contractor and expect the arrangement to work out. \u201cNo! You have to work the contract and demand you\u2019re getting what\u2019s in the contract,\u201d he said. Read: America\u2019s largest mental hospital is a jail Lieutenant Christopher Marshall was tasked with taking El-Amin and me on a tour of the jail on my visit in July. First, we went to the dedicated medical wing. Other than a sign reading INMATE BATHROOM and the fact that the chairs in the waiting area were a flimsy beige plastic, with no metal legs, it looked like an ordinary clinic. Through a door were an administrative area behind glass, a small pharmacy, and several offices. In each office was one or two tiny vertical windows. Pinned-up signs chirped Wellpath\u2019s slogan (ALWAYS DO THE RIGHT THING!) and warned against LOOK-ALIKE AND SOUND-ALIKE MEDICATIONS. Another featured a bull\u2019s-eye and read IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, BANG HEAD HERE.\n\nIn the pharmacy, medical technicians prepare medications for \u201cmed pass\u201d\u2014when a Wellpath employee takes medications from cell to cell on a cart. Novacek now tracks something to do with the \u201cinitiation of essential medication.\u201d I don\u2019t know exactly what she\u2019s monitoring, because Wellpath considers its specific performance metrics proprietary, so the county couldn\u2019t tell me. On each housing floor is a sparse medical-exam room, which removes the need for patients to be marched to the medical unit in the south tower for routine appointments. It\u2019s in the exam room that every inmate should be getting a health assessment within 14 days of booking, an indicator I do know Novacek tracks. Our final stop was a housing unit for men. At the edge of the cells, Marshall turned to me. \u201cYou look at everyone, make sure they\u2019re okay,\u201d he said, and walked along the rows, taking a brief look inside each cell and pausing for a second or so. \u201cWe don\u2019t ever come out,\u201d someone called. \u201cSure am hungry,\u201d said someone else. Waiting for lunch to be passed out, many men were sitting on the floor of their cell in front of the door\u2019s meal slot. Outside the jail, El-Amin and I stood for a moment on the steps. \u201cUse your journalistic eye to evaluate what you\u2019ve seen today,\u201d he said, giving me a hard look. The county\u2019s initial three-year contract with Wellpath is up in August 2020. Kimbrough told me the county will be renewing. Considering how much the relationship has improved, it isn\u2019t a difficult decision, he said.", "description": "One company has become the biggest provider of jail health care.
