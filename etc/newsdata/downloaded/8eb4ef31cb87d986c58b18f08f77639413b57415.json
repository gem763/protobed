We will soon announce practical steps that will result in processing the new candidate as we prepare for the by-election in the ward in due cause,\u201d the party said.\n\nShabalala has since approached the courts to challenge his suspension by the party, which he said was irregular as he was never given reasons for the step.\n\nSiphamandla service delivery woes\n\nResidents of Siphamandla in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, believe they have been neglected and have demanded that the ruling party step in to ensure that their service delivery woes are dealt with.\n\nConvener for the community members, Ayanda Vena, told City Press that they had an initial protest to the mayor\u2019s office in August.\n\nHowever, they did not feel as though the matter was treated with urgency.\n\nThe community\u2019s main concern is the lack of housing in their area.\n\nThe memorandum states that the department of human settlements has only built 35 incomplete houses since the project to develop the Siphamandla section was started two years ago.\n\nThe community said the project was halted \u201cwithout an explanation\u201d from the local government.\n\nThe group claims that even those who have already been issued with approvals for housing subsidies had been abandoned.\n\nAfter handing over their memorandum, the residents served the manager in the office of the secretary-general, Justice Pitso, with their \u201capproved\u201d subsidies and proof that they were declined houses due to the cancelled subsidies.\n\nThey are expecting a response from the ANC within 14 days and Vena says they will be taking further steps if they are ignored.\n\n\u201cWe will have to have a community gathering to decide what to do next. We will mobilise those who do not have water, housing; [and there is] no tar road and we are expecting the ward 60 caretaker councilor to also assist us,\u201d Vena said.\n\nHe is going to end his term without bettering the lives of ward 60 residents; we will still have nothing.\n\nKhehla Madlala has been appointed to act as the ward 60 councillor until such time a new councillor is elected.\n\nDuring the demonstration, resident held placards calling for the removal of Masina.\n\nVena explained that protestors want the mayor to be axed because of his lack of urgency regarding their plight.\n\n\u201cHe has to find a way forward because he is a leader. If he cannot provide services, we do not see how he has uplifted the community and he never takes any action. He is going to end his term without bettering the lives of ward 60 residents; we will still have nothing. So that is why we are saying, if he is not capable, he must just leave. We need to find a good replacement for him,\u201d according to Vena.\n\nShe questioned why other wards were better off saying that there seems to be very little consideration in allocating funds towards improving the infrastructure in Siphamandla.\n\n\u201cThe budget was just released and that makes me wonder why we have not been prioritised. The money is always used by other wards \u2013 we are seeing how people are getting services but we are always last on the list,\u201d she said.\n\nThe memorandum highlights the metro\u2019s failure to implement the integrated development plan priorities for this ward.\n\nThe plan is a process through which the metro had to prepare a strategic development plan which extends over a five-year period.\n\nThis then guides and informs all planning, budgeting, management and decision-making processes in the municipality.\n\nEkurhuleni residents had the opportunity to attend consultations to discuss the R50 billion project in April.", "description": "The ANC in Ekurhuleni has sent a stern warning to suspended ward councilor Nkosinathi Tshabalala who they believe is the instigator of the protest action calling for mayor Mzwandile Masina to be axed.", "authors": ["Queenin Masuabi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9296/38fa864718734de7aa04d34b1ba2ac0f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
