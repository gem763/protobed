In Victoria, where most A.F.L. teams play, doctors are required to keep records for only seven years after a patient turns 25. This makes it difficult for older players to document their injuries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re reaching back 20, 30 years,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nWhile they plot a legal strategy, some former players are pledging their brains to the country\u2019s only sports-specific brain bank so future generations can learn from their misfortune. Michael Buckland, a neuropathologist in Sydney, spent years looking at the brains of people with multiple sclerosis and other diseases before he read about chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., the degenerative brain disease found in athletes who played collision sports that can only be diagnosed after death.\n\n\u201cTo me, it looked like a new pathology they were describing, so I was hoping to see if we could find it in Australia,\u201d said Buckland, who opened the brain bank last year.\n\nNot surprisingly, the A.F.L. has not offered to help finance Buckland\u2019s research, but he did not expect other scientists to criticize his work by suggesting that there is no hard evidence that head injuries can lead to C.T.E.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I really knew what I was getting myself into,\u201d Buckland said. \u201cSome people are clearly unhappy about it.\u201d\n\nBuckland\u2019s first diagnosis, of a 77-year-old former Australian rules football player with dementia, was negative for C.T.E. In June, he was involved in research that showed two rugby players were found with C.T.E. The diagnoses, which were done by a different department at Buckland\u2019s hospital, shook the rugby world. A fourth diagnosis, of an ex-boxer who committed suicide, was also positive for C.T.E.\n\nBuckland said that in the years ahead, more diagnoses are sure to come back positive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be here, given the sports we play in Australia,\u201d Buckland said.", "description": "It\u2019s a brutal game, and retired players are suffering the consequences of hits to the head.
