Now their numbers are dwindling.", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE There are fewer black coaches for basketball at the top five NCAA conferences than there have been in the past. Here's what former Indiana University coach Mike Davis and others have to say about that. Dwight Adams, dwight.adams@indystar.com\n\nThere was an era in which black coaches so often won college basketball\u2019s national championship, or made the Final Four, that there was optimism one sport might make the theory of a post-racial America a reality.\n\nJohn Thompson was a giant, and not because he was 6-foot-10. When Kentucky\u2019s Tubby Smith won an NCAA title in 1998, he was the third black coach in 15 years to do so, following Thompson at Georgetown (1984) and Nolan Richardson at Arkansas (1994).\n\nContrast that to the number of black coaches from Power Five leagues in the 2019 NCAA tournament: One. That was Florida State\u2019s Leonard Hamilton.\n\nThere were eight (including coaches from the Big East) just a year ago, and eight in 2009 and 2010. The numbers have endured peaks and valleys, said Stu Jackson, the Big East\u2019s senior associate commissioner for men\u2019s basketball.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate part is, we\u2019re in one of those valleys,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nA dearth of black coaches\n\nHeading into 2019-20, the five big football-playing conferences totaled nine black basketball coaches out of 65 universities. That\u2019s 14%. The Big Ten has one, newly hired Juwan Howard of Michigan. The Pac-12 has zero.\n\nAnd basketball is a sport in which 55% of players in the Power Five \u2014 what the NCAA calls the Autonomy Five \u2014 are black. There is an abundance of black coaches in mid-major conferences or at historically black colleges, but those are not the high-profile jobs.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the public see? Well, the vast majority of college basketball on television involves the Autonomy Five conferences,\u201d said Jim Haney, executive director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches.\n\nIn the Big East, where basketball is the reason the conference exists, five of 10 head coaches are black. Those include Butler\u2019s 40-year-old LaVall Jordan, who missed the NCAA tournament in 2019 but was the second-youngest coach in the 2018 tourney.\n\nLaVall Jordan enters his third season leading his alma mater, Butler. (Photo: Jenna Watson/IndyStar)\n\nBig East\u2019s commissioner Val Ackerman said the conference has made diversity and inclusion a priority. She said that without a formal advocacy group such as the now defunct Black Coaches Association \u2014 once headquartered in Indianapolis \u2014 role models send a message to the next generation of coaches.\n\n\u201cIs this an issue? I think it is,\u201d Ackerman said. \u201cI think it is important college coaches and leadership look like the student-athlete population. And that isn\u2019t always the case. There\u2019s work to be done there, across the board.\u201d\n\nThe Big East does not feature five black coaches because of political correctness. They must win. If they don\u2019t, they will be fired, as John Thompson\u2019s son, John Thompson III, was at Georgetown.\n\nBig East campuses leverage basketball, as does Connecticut, which rejoins the conference next year. Unlike college towns, though, Big East campuses are in urban areas with large black populations.\n\n\u201cHaving a coach of color makes sense in terms of providing leadership at those institutions in those cities,\u201d said Jackson, who once coached at Wisconsin.\n\nIt is not necessarily a conference issue. Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany did not respond to an IndyStar request for comment. Ackerman said all a conference office can do is \u201cset a tone.\u201d\n\nIt is not as simple as black and white, either.\n\nInstitutional fit, search firms, NBA jobs, recruiting and other factors all influence who gets hired or fired.\n\nWhat signals are being sent?\n\nRichard Lapchick, director of The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida, recently released his 2018 racial and gender report card. College sports continues to have some of the lowest grades among all sports covered, and received a B- in racial hiring.\n\nIn Division I men\u2019s basketball, 22.4% of coaches were black, down from the all-time high of 25.2% in 2005-06.\n\nHaney said he was concerned about signals sent: What does it say to black assistant coaches and players? Is becoming a Power Five head coach even an option?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a magic wand,\u201d said Ed Cooley, a black coach who took Providence to an unprecedented five straight NCAA tournaments from 2014-18. \u201cBut we need to do a better job of building a young generation of coaches in the African-American community. Plain and simple.\u201d\n\nProvidence Friars head coach Ed Cooley reacts in the first half of their game against the Butler Bulldogs at Hinkle Fieldhouse. (Photo: Thomas J. Russo-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nSome universities look to search firms when changing coaches. Providence did not use one before hiring Cooley. Neither did Butler before hiring Jordan.\n\nYet increasingly, search firms \u201cend up being gatekeepers in terms of who eventually makes it into the interview room,\u201d according to Ackerman.\n\nThe process differs from what it once was, Haney said, when intermediaries were advocates for colleagues attempting to move up. He said it is up to the schools to ask that black coaches be among the candidates.\n\nHaney said even if an athletic director uses a search firm to distance himself from the process, \u201cthe institution is accountable.\u201d\n\nFour Big Ten universities \u2014 Illinois, Michigan State, Nebraska and Purdue \u2014 have never had a black head coach in basketball. (Of note: Michigan State has had two coaches, Jud Heathcote and Tom Izzo, since 1976. Purdue has had two, Gene Keady and Matt Painter, since 1980.)\n\nThere have been 14 black coaches in Big Ten basketball history, and just two \u2014 George Raveling of Iowa and Tubby Smith of Minnesota \u2014 ever coached in the Power Five again. Neither was fired. Raveling left for Southern California and Smith for Texas Tech.\n\nBy contrast, St. John\u2019s hired Mike Anderson, a black coach recently fired by Arkansas. He was a Richardson assistant who was also head coach at Alabama-Birmingham and Missouri, and he has the coaching experience that predecessor Chris Mullin lacked.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a home run hire for them. I really do,\u201d Cooley said.\n\nStu Jackson, while at Wisconsin, said he felt indebted to coaches who \u201cpaved the way,\u201d such as John Chaney, Thompson, Raveling and Richardson. Chaney took Temple to the Elite Eight five times from 1988 to 2001. There is pressure on all coaches, but perhaps especially on black coaches.\n\n\u201cI thought about things like that,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to compromise that standard of excellence.\u201d\n\nLaVall Jordan's burden at Butler\n\nJordan acknowledged he feels similar pressure at Butler.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s pressure in this profession, regardless,\u201d he said. \u201cIn sports in general, whether it goes said or unsaid, you feel like you want to do well so others get opportunities. Whether it\u2019s a black head coach, first female assistant coach, whatever it is. We\u2019re all tied to some group of some sort.\n\n\u201cYou want to help in the best way that you can. One of the best ways that we can is do well.\u201d\n\nThat is not always enough, either, for white or black coaches.\n\nStan Gouard, the only black coach in the Great Lakes Valley Conference, has set a high standard in 11 seasons at University of Indianapolis. He is 183-77 (.704) over the past nine years, leading the school to six straight NCAA Division II tournaments (2011-16) and one No. 1 ranking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we, as black coaches, get a fair shot,\u201d said Gouard, 48. \u201cI can\u2019t say that, one way or the other.\u201d\n\nWhat has been unfair is being told at job interviews that he lacks Division I experience. Gouard was an assistant for three years at Indiana State.\n\nAs a player, he was a two-time Division II national player of the year at Southern Indiana. He led the Eagles to their first national championship in 1995.\n\nGouard interviewed in 2013 for the Ball State job that went to James Whitford, who was an assistant at Miami (Ohio), Xavier and Arizona. Whitford is 89-105 in six seasons (77-57 over the past four).\n\n\u201cAt one point, I thought I was going to get the job. Then things changed,\u201d Gouard said.\n\nThe pathway to becoming a college head coach \u201cis sometimes blurry,\u201d Jackson suggested. Coaches get labeled: recruiter, administrator, lifetime assistant. There are ample head coaching candidates among assistants \u2014 56% in the Power Five were black in 2018, according to the NCAA.\n\nThe NBA is changing pathways.\n\nAs staffs have expanded to 11 or more \u2014 developmental and G League coaches, player development and analytics directors, video coordinators \u2014 so too have entry points into the league. There are jobs other than bench coaches that could attract candidates away from the NCAA. Nate McMillan of the Indiana Pacers is one of seven black head coaches out of 30 total in the NBA.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of jobs that have been provided for a lot of coaches,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cThey are taking jobs like that so they can get a foot into the door of the NBA.\u201d\n\nOne black coach, Ronald Nored, 29, has had seven jobs since 2013, when he finished his playing career and set a Butler record for assists. He was at Brownsburg High School for one season, had brief stops at South Alabama and Northern Kentucky, but has otherwise coached in the NBA or G League.\n\nNored said, \u201cI love college basketball,\u201d and was not influenced by any lack of opportunities there.\n\n\u201cFor me, being in the NBA was about being in an environment that I\u2019ve enjoyed being in,\u201d said Nored, entering his second season as a Charlotte Hornets assistant. \u201cI like learning at this level. It\u2019s all basketball, which is great. You get to immerse yourself in the game. And you\u2019re around really good coaches all the time. Not that you aren\u2019t in college.\u201d\n\nDavis, the former Indiana coach, said it is not about the coaches. It is about the players.\n\nTop prospects pick teams with white coaches\n\nTop black prospects choose to play for blue bloods. And those are led by white coaches: Mike Krzyzewski at Duke, John Calipari at Kentucky, Roy Williams at North Carolina, Bill Self at Kansas, Izzo at Michigan State.\n\n\u201cTo me, that\u2019s more disappointing than having few black coaches in the Power Five,\u201d Davis said.\n\nFor instance, Thompson lured two No. 1 overall draft picks to Georgetown, Patrick Ewing and Allen Iverson, and one No. 2, Alonzo Mourning. NCAA championship teams coached by Richardson and Smith were loaded.\n\nA black coach and former NBA player, Penny Hardaway, lured the top-rated 2019 recruiting class to Memphis. That deviated from the recent past.\n\nThe only top 10 class recruited by a black coach in 2018 was by Texas\u2019 Shaka Smart, No. 8, according to 247Sports. In 2017, three black coaches recruited top 10 classes: Missouri\u2019s Cuonzo Martin, No. 4; Smart, No. 6, and Alabama\u2019s Avery Johnson, No. 8. (Johnson was fired after last season.)\n\nJordan is the only black coach in the top 10 for the 2020 recruiting class. Five black high schoolers, four ranked in the top 150, put Butler 10th.\n\nIf more elite black players chose to play for black coaches, \u201cthat would be the style,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat would be what was in demand.\u201d\n\nEveryone demands winning: fans, boosters, university leaders. Which brings us back to the Big East.\n\nCooley said black coaches have been given a chance on what are predominantly white campuses. Now they have to deliver.\n\nThat puts them on equal footing with white colleagues.", "description": "While 55% of NCAA Power Five basketball players are black, just 14% of head coaches are.
