Biden on Tuesday announced his support for impeachment proceedings against President Trump if the White House does not comply with all document requests from House Democrats.\n\nHe said failure to fully comply would leave Congress \u201cno choice but to initiate impeachment.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden, a front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, said the impeachment of Mr. Trump \u201cwould be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.\u201d\n\n\u201cObstructing an effort to conduct an investigation is not the conduct of an American president,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is an abuse of power. It undermines our national security. It violates his oath of office and it strikes at the heart of the sworn responsibility a president has to put national interest before personal interest.\u201d\n\nThe announcement came shortly after Mr. Trump said he would comply with House Democrats demand that he release a transcript of his phone call with the president of Ukraine in which he discussed Democratic front-runner Joseph R. Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nThe phone call was the impetus for the uptick in impeachment fever on Capitol Hill and among 2020 Democratic hopefuls.\n\nMr. Biden said the transcript would not be enough to ward off impeachment. He said the White House must also release the whistleblower complaint that began this latest imbroglio for Mr. Trump. The White House so far has blocked its release.\n\n\u201cThe president should stop stonewalling this investigation and every other investigation into his wrongdoing,\u201d said Mr. Biden.\n\nA whistleblower accused Mr. Trump of pressuring the Ukrainian president in July to open a corruption investigation targeting Mr. Biden and his son, who served on a board of a Ukraine gas company.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopefuls Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Kamala Harris of California previously called for impeachment.\n\nSen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont was expected to endorse impeachment in a speech Tuesday in Iowa, according to the Associated Press.\n\nMr. Biden has made his perceived electoral strength against Mr. Tump the foundation of his campaign. He routinely warns that the character of America will be forever altered by racism and bigotry if Mr. Trump wins re-election.\n\nThe intrigue of the Ukraine call is the latest example of Mr. Trump defiling America, said Mr. Biden.\n\nMr. Trump has said Mr. Biden was the one who did a \u201cterrible thing\u201d by abusing White House power.\n\nDuring a visit to Kiev as vice president in 2016, Mr. Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if the country\u2019s leader did not fire Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor for failing to investigate corruption.\n\nThe prosecutor also was allegedly looking into the Ukrainian gas company where Hunter Biden collected paychecks, including as much as $3 million in wire transfers, according to reports.\n\nPreviously, Mr. Biden boasted about strong-arming Ukraine. Now he says that it was not improper and his son did not discuss foreign business deals.\n\nMr. Trump has acknowledged discussing Biden in the July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe Trump administration was withholding U.S. aid from Ukraine at that time.\n\nMr. Trump said Tuesday he temporarily withheld military aid from Ukraine because he wanted other countries to contribute their fair share, denying he used it as leverage to pressure Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate Mr. Biden.\n\n\u201cAs far as withholding funds, they were paid,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the United Nations. \u201cThey were fully paid. I want other countries to put up money. People called me and said \u2018let it go,\u2019 and I let it go.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
