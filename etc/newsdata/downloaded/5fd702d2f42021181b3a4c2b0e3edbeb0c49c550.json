When Lenz pressed him on his record toward LGBTQ issues, he responded in a way that she later told The New York Times was \"a little condescending.\"\n\nThe exchange was captured on video, in front of an audience of 700. While questioning the candidate, Lenz said \"In 1994, you did vote for 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' and in 1988 you voted for the Defense of Marriage Act. You did vote to repeal both of those, but you have also praised Vice President Mike Pence as a 'decent guy.'\"\n\nIn response to Biden's praise of the current vice president, who has a record of anti-gay stances, the crowd booed. Biden responded by saying \"You're a lovely person,\" and laughter could be heard.\n\n\"I'm just asking the questions that people want to knows,\" Lenz replied, to cheering and applause.\n\nRead more: Trump and Rudy Giuliani are reviving allegations of a conspiracy involving Joe Biden and his son in response to a whistleblower report\n\nShe also tweeted that as the two departed the stage, Biden said \"You're a real sweetheart,\" to her, dryly.\n\nIn his full response to Lenz's questioning, Biden pointed out that he came out in support of same-sex marriage days before former President Barack Obama did. \"I didn't have to evolve,\" Biden said.\n\nSeveral prominent feminists responded to Lenz's tweet with praise, including the author Jessica Valenti, who replied that she was \"a f---ing hero.\" Biden supporters pointed out that the candidate responded quickly on Twitter to his own praise of Pence, noting that \"there is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President.\"\n\nBiden also said that he has been sympathetic to same-sex couples ever since he was a child, and saw two men kiss in Wilmington, Delaware, where Biden is from. The candidate said his father said \"'Joey, it's simple. They love each other.\"\n\nThe forum was hosted by GLAAD and was the first event of its kind for the 2020 Democratic primary. Another LGBTQ town hall-style event for the Democratic candidates is being hosted by the Human Rights Campaign and will be broadcast by CNN on October 10 in LA.\n\nNeither Lenz nor Biden's campaign immediately responded to Business Insider's request for comment.", "description": "When the moderator at the LGBTQ forum for presidential candidates pressed Joe Biden on his record, he called her 'a real sweetheart' afterward.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d86816d2e22af0579432d92-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
