Dre Strohm left the team after their latest CrossFit Games team win, and immediately the rumour mill started working, as fans speculated Panchik would be his replacement.\n\nIt seems, even before the Games began, Froning knew that Panchik would be replacing Strohm.\n\nCrossFit Mayhem has won four CrossFit Games titles, the most recent at the 2019 Games. With the addition of Panchik, who finished fourth in the individual competition this year, their domination looks set to continue. Froning announced the decision at the Rogue Iron Games, which will see Froning and Panchik go toe to toe in the Open 20.1 workout.\n\n\u201cI looked at his track record. He's super fit. We\u2019ve never really hung out in the past, but we've known each other in the past and competed against in each other in the past,\u201d Froning said. \u201cHe's super competitive, I knew some of his background from other guys like Ben [Smith, Games athlete]. So I reached out to him before the [2019] Games.\u201d\n\nPanchik has competed at eight CrossFit Games. This year\u2019s fourth place was his equal highest place, having come fourth twice before.\n\n\u201cI've been doing it for eight years and I'm just excited to take on a new adventure,\u201d Panchik said. \u201cBeing part of CrossFit Mayhem will allow me to keep competing for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a great feeling. Rich and his team have accomplished so much in the sport, I\u2019m so excited about the opportunity,\u201d Panchik said.\n\n\u201c[I\u2019m] Definitely [focused on] team for this year, but I\u2019d definitely like to mix things up at least once as an individual this year,\u201d he said.\n\nFans will now expected Mayhem to pick up their fifth CrossFit Games title, but Froning said his own expectations are higher than anyone\u2019s: \u201cNo one adds more pressure other than ourselves, winning is the plan every year so no extra pressure is added.\u201d", "description": "Months of speculation is over as Rich Froning announces Scott Panchik as his latest team member", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/11/5bdbd242-ebb9-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_image_hires_082037.JPG?itok=Vxwd5weB&v=1570753243", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
