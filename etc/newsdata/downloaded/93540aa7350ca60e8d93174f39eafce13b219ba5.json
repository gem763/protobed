When I was little I\u2019d write in my diary every year about what I wanted to achieve the following year.\n\n'One of them was \"next year I'm going to be famous\", I don't know why I wrote that. Then the following year I wrote \"I'm going to move to America, I\u2019ll be a singer\".\n\nFun: The 22-year-old's words came as she and her band mates Wes Nelson, Zara McDermott and Eyal Booker enjoyed a boat trip during the audition stages at Simon's LA mansion\n\n'It\u2019s a little embarrassing to admit but one of them was, \"next year I'm going to meet Simon Cowell\". Well, here I am, in his house!'\n\nMeanwhile, her fellow Love Island star and singer Eyal, 24, echoed her amazement at being in Simon's home and taking part in the much-loved singing programme.\n\nHe added: 'It's so surreal and crazy to think we\u2019re actually in LA in a band together performing at Simon Cowell's house on the X Factor. It\u2019s something I always dreamt of but can\u2019t believe it\u2019s actually happening.\n\n'I\u2019ve watched the show since I was young and growing up it\u2019s become a staple in my household so to be a contestant in it is just a little bit of a pinch yourself moment.'\n\nThrilled: 'It was a dream come true meeting Simon Cowell. When I was little I\u2019d write in my diary every year about what I wanted to achieve the following year'\n\nGoals: 'It\u2019s a little embarrassing to admit but one of them was, \"next year I'm going to meet Simon Cowell\". Well, here I am, in his house!'\n\nLast week's show saw The Islanders and other acts perform in front of industry bigwigs in Simon's stunning backyard, while on Saturday, the other half of the performers will take to the stage.\n\nAnd the reality favourites were left pinching themselves at the brilliant opportunity to live it up in Hollywood.\n\n'It\u2019s been amazing', gushed Zara, 22. 'Obviously we've not really stopped since we got here, but being in X Factor HQ is just amazing. The house is just beautiful.\n\n'It feels like we are on a Hollywood movie. We\u2019ve been doing loads of filming which has been so much fun. We got to go out on a yacht which was such a treat, it felt like we were back on Love Island just messing around!'\n\nExcited: Meanwhile, her fellow Love Island star and singer Eyal, 24, echoed her amazement at being in Simon's home and taking part in the much-loved singing programme\n\nStunned: 'It's so surreal and crazy to think we\u2019re actually in LA in a band together performing at Simon Cowell's house on the X Factor. It\u2019s something I always dreamt of'\n\nWhile Wes agreed: 'The X Factor HQ is beautiful, the weather's been amazing. We've been working hard though, so we're being sensible. No partying.\n\n'We're taking it easy but may treat ourselves when filming has finished and we find out if we\u2019re through to live shows - you need to let off some steam from time to time.'\n\nSharing their enthusiasm at being in the star-studded Californian neighbourhood, Samira said: 'I\u2019ve never been to LA, I feel like I'm in a movie, I'm literally in a movie.\n\n'Where we're staying is the same hotel where they filmed Pretty Woman, so I'm literally just like walking down the road like \"this is not real\u201d.\n\nLoving life: 'It\u2019s been amazing', gushed Zara. 'Obviously we've not really stopped since we got here, but being in X Factor HQ is just amazing. The house is just beautiful'\n\nGood times: 'It feels like we are on a Hollywood movie. We\u2019ve been doing loads of filming which has been so much fun'\n\n'Most movies are set in LA, we\u2019re in Hollywood, so many famous people live here. I mean, the Kardashians live here! It feels surreal, that is the word. It's just crazy that I'm here.'\n\nThis week, the 14 acts will find out whether whether they've made it through to the live shows, which kick off next week.\n\nAnd The Islanders have made it clear that they are desperate to make it through to the next round.\n\nSamira insisted: 'I want to get to the live shows so badly so we can put on a big performance, a theatrical show for the audience. The whole performance value of it, I think that's what makes X Factor so great.'\n\nDetermined: 'While Wes agreed: 'The X Factor HQ is beautiful, the weather's been amazing. We've been working hard though, so we're being sensible. No partying'\n\nWhile Wes, 21, shared his nerves, saying: 'Waiting to find out if we get through to live shows is so nerve wracking. My palms will be sweaty when we get out there for our chat with the judges. I'm gonna be very clammy!'\n\nEyal then showed his competitive side as he declared: 'We\u2019re in it to win it and I don\u2019t think any of us would be here if we weren\u2019t taking this seriously.\n\n'This is an opportunity we don\u2019t want to let go of. We want to be in a successful band after this show, if we make it through to the live shows, and do all the things successful bands out there do!!'\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity continues tonight at 8.30pm on ITV.", "description": "The 22-year-old West End star admitted that she was 'embarrassed' to meet The X Factor: Celebrity judge Simon Cowell after revealing it had been a 'lifelong dream' to do so.", "authors": ["Niomi Harris For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/16/19929306-0-image-a-200_1571499593512.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
