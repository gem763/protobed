We did not give ICE forewarning of the protest, nor did we seek to interfere with the protest as it was occurring. Indeed, it is The Crimson\u2019s practice to wait until a protest concludes before asking for comment from the target of the protest \u2014 a rule which was followed here. The Crimson\u2019s outreach to ICE only consisted of public information and a broad summary of protestors\u2019 criticisms. As noted in the story, ICE did not respond to a request for comment,\u201d wrote Crimson President Kristine E. Guillaume and Managing Editor Angela N. Fu.\n\nBoth women are seniors scheduled to graduate next year.\n\n\u201cExperts from the Student Press Law Center and the Society of Professional Journalists have affirmed that The Crimson followed ethical journalistic practices,\u201d they noted, before concluding that \u201cwe understand that some readers may disagree with The Crimson\u2019s policies.\u201d\n\nThe tone of the Crimson letter was not lost on some commentators at its site.\n\n\u201cIf Donald Trump insisted that The Crimson cover just his point of view and hold off from ever seeking comment from his political opponents, I doubt that this long-winded and painfully defensive apology would be forthcoming,\u201d said commenter \u201cNestor 33.\u201d\n\nAmong the groups joining Act on a Dream\u2019s demand for one-sided stories, at least about immigration and ICE, are the Harvard College Democrats and the Harvard College Democrats for [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren.\n\nAct on a Dream did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Times.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
