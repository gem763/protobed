The president says he has nothing to do with these decisions, but also that holding primaries he is sure to win would be a waste of money. The susceptibility of this argument to abuse by a ruler ought to preclude its being made.\n\nThe vast majority of Republicans approve of what Trump has done on taxes, judges, regulation, and most other issues, though they also support electoral competition. Trump would be likely to win the primaries handily, demonstrating his strength among Republicans while the Democrats tussle. His allies should want to see that, rather than make it seem as though he is too weak to face competition. But regardless of how it works out for him, Republican primary voters are capable of making the decision among Trump and the others \u2014 who so far include William Weld and Joe Walsh as well as Sanford. They deserve to be able to do so.", "description": "", "authors": ["National Review", "Nationalreview.Com Republican-Presidential-Primaries-Let-Voters-Choose"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
