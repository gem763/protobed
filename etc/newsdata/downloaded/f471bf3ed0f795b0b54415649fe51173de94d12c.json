It would remain aligned to EU single market rules for goods \u2013 subject to regular approval by Belfast.\n\nEU leaders have reacted with scepticism, fearing the necessary customs checks would bring a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, threatening hard-earned peace.\n\nSingham told Euronews Now presenter Oliver Whitfield-Miocic that the UK government and Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had made significant concessions on regulatory alignment.\n\nIn turn, he said, \u201cthe EU will have to climb down\u201d on its insistence that Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland stay in the same customs territory.\n\nLondon and Brussels remain far apart, a fortnight before a European Council summit of EU government leaders and less than four weeks before the UK is due to leave the EU on October 31.\n\nWatch the interview in the video player above.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhy is Boris Johnson's latest Brexit plan a headache for the EU?\n\nTusk 'unconvinced' by Brexit plan: How Europe reacted to UK proposals\n\n'Very little time': Read Johnson's letter to EU chief Juncker on latest Brexit plan\n\nBrexit Guide: Where are we now?", "description": "A trade expert influential with the UK government tells Euronews the EU must abandon its insistence on an all-island customs territory.", "authors": ["Alasdair Sandford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/67/56/1000x563_cmsv2_96268bcd-0093-55bf-bc08-58b333cfc21c-4206756.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
