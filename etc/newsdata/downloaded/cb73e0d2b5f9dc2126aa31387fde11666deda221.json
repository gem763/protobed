Now they face a scrappy new coalition as well: prosecutors from nearly all 50 states.\n\nIn a rare show of bipartisan force, attorneys general from 48 states along with Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia are investigating whether Google\u2019s huge online search and advertising business is engaging in monopolistic behavior. The Texas-led antitrust investigation of Google, announced Monday, follows a separate multistate investigation of Facebook\u2019s market dominance that was revealed Friday.\n\nThe state moves follow similar sweeping antitrust tech investigations launched by the Federal Trade Commission and the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Justice; the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee is conducting a similar probe. But should federal officials tire of their work, the state-led efforts could keep them on their toes.\n\nStates have worked closely together on other matters, such as the fight to curb opioid abuse. But the sheer number participating in this kind of antitrust effort is unprecedented and gives it more weight, said Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, a Republican.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an accumulation of public frustration, whether it\u2019s from consumers, other players in the market, regulators, lawmakers,\u201d Reyes said in an interview Monday.\n\nFiona Scott Morton, a Yale economics professor and former antitrust official at the Justice Department under the Obama administration, said it\u2019s important that states are taking the lead because the Trump administration is \u201cnot really enforcing antitrust law except against companies the president is upset with.\u201d\n\nShe noted the Trump administration\u2019s unsuccessful push to use antitrust law to block AT&T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner, which owns CNN, a frequent target of Trump\u2019s criticism; and Friday\u2019s announcement that federal antitrust enforcers would investigate automakers that worked with California on tougher emissions limits.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what consumers want,\u201d she said. \u201cConsumers want to be protected from anticompetitive conduct.\u201d\n\nStates haven\u2019t seriously taken up antitrust enforcement \u2014 using laws originally crafted to combat railroad and oil barons in the 19th century \u2014 since a major antitrust case against Microsoft about two decades ago. Then, state leadership helped propel federal action.\n\nBack in 2016, Reyes and a Democratic counterpart, Washington, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, tried unsuccessfully to get the Federal Trade Commission to reopen an earlier investigation into Google for allegedly favoring its own products in search results.\n\nThe FTC declined, leaving European regulators to take the lead in similar probes overseas, Reyes said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it\u2019s almost impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services. Google\u2019s dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.\n\nThe company \u2014 and peers such as Amazon, Facebook and Apple \u2014 have long argued that although their businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. Influenced by the popularity of the companies\u2019 ubiquitous tech products and their significant lobbying power, most American political leaders didn\u2019t challenge that view.\n\nBut the public debate over the tech industry has changed dramatically since Reyes and Racine sent their letter to the FTC at the end of the Obama administration three years ago. Culprits in that shift include Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, in which a political data mining firm affiliated with Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign improperly accessed the personal data of as many as 87 million users.\n\nOn Monday, Reyes and Racine joined forces again \u2014 this time flanked by nearly a dozen mostly Republican state attorneys general on the steps of the Supreme Court and dozens more from both parties who signed onto the formal investigation.\n\n\u201cIgnoring 50 AGs is a lot more difficult than ignoring two AGs,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cDC and Utah had raised these issues but didn\u2019t feel we had enough firepower or resources on our own.\u201d\n\nScott Morton, the Yale professor, said most states have laws that mimic federal antitrust laws, but it can be harder for state attorneys general to enforce those laws because they don\u2019t usually have in-house antitrust experts. They can get around that, she added, by working together with other states and hiring shared experts.\n\nReyes emphasized that the state-led effort is not \u201canti-tech,\u201d and argued it is \u201cactually for the benefit of the tech ecosystem to help level the playing field.\u201d\n\nHe said there\u2019s nothing wrong with Google being the dominant search player if it\u2019s done fairly, but the investigation will look into whether Google crosses the line \u201cbetween aggressive business practices and illegal ones.\u201d\n\nA tech trade association that has supported some antitrust measures expressed wariness about how states are proceeding.\n\n\u201cWe hope the investigations will be law and evidence-based and will restrain from overly politicizing these inquiries, and that both companies and authorities will work together in good faith,\u201d said Ed Black, president and CEO of the Communications Computer and Communications Industry Association.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writers Rachel Lerman in San Francisco and Marcy Gordon in Washington contributed to this report.", "description": "Attorneys general from 48 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia are investigating whether Google is engaging in monopolistic behavior.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7792f2240000d32677ca00.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
