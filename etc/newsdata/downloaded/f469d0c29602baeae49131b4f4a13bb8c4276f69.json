The campaign already has 20 paid staff members in the state, and expects to expand to 100. And the campaign and the Republican National Committee are outspending Democrats by about four to one on digital advertising, according to campaign officials and local Democratic Party officials.\n\nDemocrats are taking note of the Republican efforts and have voiced concerns that Minnesota may actually be in play in 2020.\n\n\u201cOver the last 25 years, I\u2019ve never seen an investment as robust and deep this early by a Republican presidential candidate,\u201d Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party told the Times.\n\nOn Monday, Martin and the DFL attempted to raise money off Trump\u2019s visit to Minnesota in a tweet that said:\n\nTHREAD: Trump is coming to Minnesota this week to break our blue wall and flip our state red in 2020. That can\u2019t happen. We\u2019re launching a #MoneyBlizzard to make sure we have the resources to fight back against his hateful campaign.

The Target Center has backed off cancelling the contract, which means President Trump\u2019s Keep America Great rally will go on as scheduled,\u201d Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement issued on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cConsistent with our original agreement with the venue, the Trump campaign has not agreed to pay any additional funds. We look forward to seeing everyone Thursday night,\u201d Parscale concluded.\n\nThe presidential election is not the only area where Minnesota is expected to be a battleground in 2020.\n\nFive of the state\u2019s eight congressional districts are \u201cswing seats\u201d that could be switched from one party to another. Three of those seats are currently held by Democrats, two by Republicans.\n\nShould Republicans pick up all three seats, they would only need to flip 16 more in other states around the country to take back the majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nBoth supporters and opponents of President Trump are expected to show up in force outside the Target Center prior to Thursday evening\u2019s rally.", "description": "The Trump campaign rally in Minneapolis marks the beginning of the campaign's intense efforts to win the state of Minnesota in 2020.", "authors": ["Michael Patrick Leahy"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/nc-donald-trump-rally-9919-gettyimages-640x480-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
