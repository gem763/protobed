Some of the allegations appear to centre on Ukraine, according to reports in the Washington Post and the New York Times.\n\nTrump spoke to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, on 25 July, about two weeks before the complaint was filed. Washington is rife with speculation that the US president may have been pressuring Zelensky to provide damaging information about former vice-president Joe Biden, his potential opponent in the 2020 election.\n\nOn Friday the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. In the July phone call, Trump urged Zelensky about eight times to work with Giuliani on the investigation, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nOne of the sources added that Trump did not mention a provision of foreign aid to Ukraine on the call, and the source did not believe Trump offered the Ukrainian president any quid pro quo.\n\nFormer New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for Trump, told the Journal he met top Ukrainian officials about the prospect of an investigation in June and August.\n\nIn 2016 the Trump campaign had numerous contacts with Russia and accepted a meeting that promised \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton, although the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report earlier this year concerning his investigation into the controversy stopped short of finding direct collusion.\n\n\n\nClinton, a former secretary of state and Trump\u2019s opponent in 2016, tweeted: \u201cThe president asked a foreign power to help him win an election. Again.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump offered a characteristically pugnacious defence against what he called a \u201cpartisan\u201d whistleblower. He told reporters in the Oval Office it was \u201ca ridiculous story\u201d and \u201cjust another political hack job\u201d and his conversations with foreign leaders were \u201ctotally appropriate\u201d.\n\nAsked if he discussed Biden, Trump insisted: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed.\u201d But he added \u201csomeone ought to look into\u201d Biden, who is currently leading polls for the Democratic nomination in 2020.\n\nTrump also said he did not know if the phone call with Zelensky \u2013 a comedian and political novice elected in May \u2013 was the subject of the complaint, now caught in a standoff between the White House and Congress.\n\nThe whistleblower filed it with the inspector general of the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, who acknowledged that he considered it a credible matter of \u201curgent concern\u201d that merited notifying congressional committees.\n\n\n\nBut during a three-hour closed-door briefing on Thursday, Atkinson told the House intelligence committee the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, a Trump appointee, barred him from providing details.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, the top House Democrat, said: \u201cReports of a reliable whistleblower complaint regarding the president\u2019s communications with a foreign leader raise grave, urgent concerns for our national security.\u201d\n\nTrump whistleblower complaint: focus shifts to Ukraine amid Giuliani claims Read more\n\nShe added: \u201cThe president and acting DNI\u2019s stonewalling must end immediately, and the whistleblower must be provided with every protection guaranteed by the law to defend the integrity of our government and ensure accountability and trust.\u201d\n\nThe intelligence committee\u2019s chairman, Democrat Adam Schiff, told reporters: \u201cThat whole purpose is being frustrated here because the director of national intelligence has made the unprecedented decision not to share the complaint with Congress.\u201d\n\nSchiff warned that he was prepared to go to court to force the Trump administration to open up about the complaint. \u201cThe inspector general has said this cannot wait. There\u2019s an urgency here that I think the courts will recognise.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s relationship with Ukraine has been the subject of growing scrutiny. In early September, an editorial in the Washington Post asked: \u201cIs Trump strong-arming Volodymyr Zelensky for political gain?\u201d\n\nThe Post editorial board claimed \u201cwe\u2019re reliably told\u201d that the president \u201cis attempting to force Mr Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 US presidential election by launching an investigation of the leading Democratic candidate, Joe Biden\u201d.\n\nThe leader column added: \u201cMr Trump is not just soliciting Ukraine\u2019s help with his presidential campaign; he is using US military aid the country desperately needs in an attempt to extort it.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic heads of three House committees recently announced an investigation into alleged efforts by Trump and Giuliani to pressure the Ukrainian government for their own political ends, including by withholding US security assistance.\n\nThey allege Trump and Giuliani have pressured Kiev to prosecute Ukrainians who provided evidence against Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and to provide damaging information about Biden\u2019s son. Hunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian gas company beginning in 2014, while his father was vice-president.\n\nThe Democrats have demanded a full transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call along with a list of participants.\n\nThe intrigue deepened on Thursday night when Giuliani was asked by the CNN host Chris Cuomo if he had asked Ukraine to look into Biden. He initially said: \u201cNo, actually I didn\u2019t,\u201d but about 30 seconds later admitted: \u201cOf course I did.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, reviews the guard of honour with his Slovak counterpart Zuzana Caputova at the Mariinskiy Palace in Kiev. Photograph: Sergey Dolzhenko/EPA\n\nObservers in Ukraine said there were no signs yet that an agreement had been struck between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nSerhii Leshchenko, an investigative journalist and former MP who advised Zelensky on foreign policy during the campaign, said: \u201cThere is nothing it could be besides this Biden stuff. It\u2019s clear what they were talking about.\u201d\n\nHe cited a Ukrainian readout of the 25 July phone call between the two leaders: \u201cDonald Trump is convinced that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.\u201d\n\nLeschenko said Trump allies including Giuliani had sought meetings with Zelensky since before his May inauguration, and accused Giuliani of \u201cattempting to interfere in Ukrainian internal politics and blackmail Ukraine\u201d.\n\n\u201c[Zelensky] doesn\u2019t want to be involved in this fight between two political parties in the US,\u201d Leschenko said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to become a hostage of this situation.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Ukraine\u2019s presidential administration announced on Friday that Zelensky will meet Trump next week during the UN general assembly in New York.\n\nZelensky has not spoken publicly about the 25 July call with Trump since it was revealed as a cause for the whistleblower complaint on Thursday. A representative for Zelensky could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n\n\nThe Ukrainian president has sought a face-to-face meeting with Trump to discuss financial aid for the country and support in its conflict with Russia. Zelensky has met the vice-president, Mike Pence.\n\nTrump and attorney general William Barr claimed the Mueller report cleared him of collusion and obstruction of justice. Critics say it showed the Trump campaign was eager to accept help from Moscow and crucial questions remain unanswered.\n\nThe pressure on Trump looks set to intensify. Ben Rhodes, former national security adviser to Barack Obama, wrote on Twitter: \u201cIf Trump was trying to abuse his power of the presidency to solicit foreign help for his campaign, it\u2019s hard to imagine a more impeachable offense.\u201d", "description": "White House rocked by whistleblower complaint as reports say Trump pressured Ukraine president to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son", "authors": ["David Smith", "Andrew Roth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/034acf6200032346dbdd1f651150c51ac54478ae/0_184_5042_3025/master/5042.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=589bdef260042f2ec9c0056976f2ea1d", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
