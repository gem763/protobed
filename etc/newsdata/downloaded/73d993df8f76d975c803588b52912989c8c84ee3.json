Three minutes of masturbating to porn solves that problem in an instant.\n\nWhat if you\u2019re craving the excitement of sex with someone you haven\u2019t already slept with? Watching a stranger onscreen have sex with someone you\u2019d quite like to, is the next best thing.\n\nWatching porn doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t being sexually satisfied by your partner, don\u2019t find them attractive or wish they looked and acted like the person you\u2019re looking at onscreen.\n\nIt\u2019s simply a sensible way to satisfy natural sexual urges that might otherwise make you vulnerable to cheating or having an affair.\n\nThey\u2019ll keep on masturbating\n\nI am constantly astonished when I meet or hear from people who consider masturbating \u2018cheating\u2019 \u2013 even without porn thrown in.\n\nYet there\u2019s a percentage of the population who do believe that if their partner satisfies themselves solo, it means something is horribly wrong.\n\nIf your partner isn\u2019t having sex with you at all or rarely - and only has sex solo \u2013 it is indeed a problem.\n\nSex expert Tracey Cox (pictured) shares her advice for a successful love life\n\nBut if you\u2019re having happy, regular sex and find out they\u2019re supplementing that now and then with solo sex, there is nothing to worry about.\n\nSolo sex is all about scratching a different kind of itch.\n\nMost of us can DIY in under five minutes.\n\nSex with your partner requires several things.\n\nFirst, that your partner is around and also wants to have sex. If they\u2019re not there or don\u2019t want to have sex, masturbating is one way of relieving sexual tension, so you don\u2019t turn into a sex pest.\n\nPartner sex takes time and effort. You have to arouse your partner and (usually) make sure they orgasm as well.\n\nSometimes, you don\u2019t have time for all that or you feel like a snack not the full three courses.\n\nOr you want selfish sex.\n\nMasturbating means you have no-one to worry about but yourself: it\u2019s a simple pleasure release that\u2019s blissfully without judgement.\n\nThey\u2019ll still find other people attractive\n\nEven if you think your partner is the most attractive/sexy/beautiful/handsome person you have ever met in the world, ever, it still won\u2019t stop you noticing that other people are also pleasing to the eye.\n\nLove and commitment stop us acting on this attraction \u2013 they don\u2019t stop us experiencing it.\n\nBeing with someone who openly checks out other people in front of you is totally unacceptable, of course.\n\nBut seeing your partner\u2019s eyes do an involuntary flicker when someone hot comes into view isn\u2019t something worth getting het up about.\n\nTracey says love doesn't stop us from experiencing attraction to others, it's not worth getting upset over your partner's eyes involuntarily looking at someone hot (file image)\n\nIf it really bothers you, do what I do: acknowledge the other person\u2019s beauty so they have permission to look.\n\n\u201cCheck out that girl\u2019s legs,\u201d I\u2019ll say to my husband. Or \u2018God, how good looking is she!\u201d.\n\nI\u2019d rather direct his gaze than see him sneak a look.\n\nMore challenging is when your partner has a friend who is good-looking or annoyingly charismatic.\n\nBut, while it might be blindingly obvious to you that his best female friend makes most men\u2019s heads swivel, he might not even notice anymore.\n\nOr she\u2019s not his type. Or he prefers her as a friend.\n\nJust because we think someone is attractive, doesn\u2019t mean we act on it or even want to.\n\nAdmiring beauty is one of life\u2019s pleasures.\n\nWhether it be looking at a painting, flower, a baby or grown person, staring at beautiful things is just what humans do.\n\nThey\u2019ll fantasise about other people\n\nJust about everyone has sexual fantasies: 90 per cent of women and 96 per cent of men have them daily.\n\nThey\u2019re a portable, potent sex aid with lots of benefits \u2013that also cause a great deal of distress.\n\nImagining something in your head is an entirely different matter than doing it in real life but lots of people consider them a betrayal.\n\nSometimes, people do have sex with other people or leave their partners for people they\u2019ve been fantasising about.\n\nTracey says that almost everyone has sexual fantasies about other people, however pressuring your partner to talk about their's just causes paranoia (file image)\n\nBut most don\u2019t.\n\nFor most people, fantasies are more pleasant, erotic daydreams than unexpressed desire. We\u2019ll conjure up sexual situations we have no desire at all to fulfil in real life.\n\nThey\u2019re a way of solving the main problem people have with monogamy: sexual boredom. A means of satisfying a craving for sexual variety, safely, without hurting our partner.\n\nMost people adopt the \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 policy with fantasies because most of us don\u2019t want to know that someone we love is having lustful thoughts about someone else.\n\nForcing your partner to admit they sometimes fantasise about other people accomplishes absolutely nothing but make them feel guilty and you paranoid.\n\nThey\u2019ll hate you as well as love you\n\nEven if you were to accomplish what is unachievable - do every single thing right and never upset your partner - they would still have days where they feel resentful of you.\n\nOr are bored by you. Annoyed by you. And yes, hate you as well.\n\nArguing is healthy: it means you\u2019re not afraid to speak up about things that upset you. Anger is healthy, too: it means you care deeply about each other.\n\nLove isn\u2019t a straight line. Even the best relationships have ups and downs.\n\nIt\u2019s indifference, not flashes of hatred, that kills relationships.\n\nListen to Tracey on Jack Radio, Wednesday\u2019s live from 12-1pm.
