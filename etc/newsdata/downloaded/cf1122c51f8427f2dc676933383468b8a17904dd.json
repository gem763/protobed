According to The Post, however, he could be placed on the NFL commissioner's \"exempt list\" as long as the case remained open. The Post cited \"multiple people familiar with the situation.\"\n\nWhile on paid leave, players are not permitted to attend games or practice, meaning the wide receiver would have to wait to make his New England Patriots debut.\n\n\"We are reviewing the matter,\" the NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told The Post without further comment.\n\nAnother source told The Post that placing Brown on the exempt list was \"possible\" and something the NFL was \"going to have to focus on.\"\n\nThe league is investigating the allegations, with NFL representatives planning to meet with Taylor next week.\n\nRead more: Bill Belichick ended his press conference after 4 minutes of being peppered with questions about Antonio Brown\n\nBrown joined the New England Patriots on a one-year deal on Saturday, only hours after being cut by the Oakland Raiders.\n\nThe 31-year-old asked via Instagram last week to be released by the Raiders, saying: \"I have worked my whole life to prove that the system is blind to see talent like mines.\n\n\"Now that everyone sees it, they want me to conform to that same system that has failed me all those years. 'I'm not mad at anyone. I'm just asking for the freedom to prove them all wrong.' Release me @raiders.\"\n\nHis wish was granted shortly after, and he celebrated by posting again, this time with a video on YouTube, in which he phoned his grandmother and said: \"They freed me Grandma! They freed me! Ha-ha! Ahhh, God is the greatest.\"\n\nThe Patriots are scheduled to play their second game of the new season Sunday against the Miami Dolphins at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nIt is unclear whether Brown will play.", "description": "Antonio Brown could be placed on the NFL commissioner's exempt list, meaning he would have to wait to make his New England Patriots debut.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7a18c12e22af0b8a63cef2-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
