The Grammy winning singer confirmed she did so to stand in solidarity with quarterback Colin Kaepernick.\n\nWhen asked about the Super Bowl halftime offer \u2014 Maroon 5 was the show's headliner \u2014 Rihanna said she \"absolutely\" turned it down.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t dare do that,\" she told the magazine. \"For what? Who gains from that? Not my people. I just couldn\u2019t be a sellout. I couldn\u2019t be an enabler. There\u2019s things within that organization that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way.\u201d\n\nMessages left with the NFL and NBC were not immediately returned when contacted by USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nKaepernick, who last played for the San Francisco 49ers in 2016, was the first NFL player to kneel during the pregame national anthem as he protested police brutality and social inequality. While many other NFL players followed his lead and knelt during the 2017 and 2018 seasons, Kaepernick, a free-agent, remains unemployed.", "description": "Rihanna explained in interview why she stood by Colin Kaepernick and didn't want to perform at Super Bowl, saying she \"couldn't be an enabler.\"", "authors": ["Scott Gleeson", "Published P.M.
