Everybody in the room knows that as well. Manufacturers and consumers pay the tariffs. We do not collect tariffs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not letting me finish here,\u201d Navarro said.\n\n\u201cYou know as well as me that\u2019s not an accurate statement,\u201d Sciutto insisted.\n\nCritics of tariffs have often insisted that U.S. consumers indirectly bear the cost of tariffs through higher prices on goods, although official government data on consumer prices do not support that claim. There is no debate, however, about whether the U.S. government actually collects the tariffs.\n\nTariffs are paid by importers to the U.S. Treasury. The additional tax may be absorbed by the importer, squeezing profit margins, or it may be passed on to consumers. If the exporting country lowers its prices or devalues its currency to keep its products competitive, the exporters are effectively paying for the tariffs.\n\nSciutto appears to have confused the debate over who pays the tariffs for a debate over whether the U.S. government collects the tariffs at all. But rather than correct his initial mistake, he repeats it and insists that everyone in the room knows he is correct at Navarro is being misleading.", "description": "\"We don't collect tariffs,\" Sciutto said, incorrectly, Thursday. \"You know that as well.
