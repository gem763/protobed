Since the failed coup against him in 2016, Erdogan has forced the shutdown of at least 130 media outlets; those that survived, like the newspapers Zaman and Hurriyet, were sold to Erdogan-friendly owners and now mostly republic Anadolu reports. Others, like Yeni Safak, were so fanatically pro-Erdogan to begin with that the government did nothing overtly to impact their reporting.\n\nTurkey is the world\u2019s most prolific jailer of journalists. Erdogan has said publicly, \u201cdemocracy is not possible with the media.\u201d\n\nAnadolu Agency accused Macron of having \u201ccriticized Turkey\u2019s policy on Syria as well as freedom of expression in the country\u201d in remarks at this week\u2019s Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE).\n\nMacron \u201cexceeded his boundaries by defaming Turkey on freedom of expression,\u201d Cavusoglu told the outlet. \u201cHow many migrants has Macron accepted in his country? Instead, he hosted YPG/PKK terrorists at Elysee Palace.\u201d\n\nThe YPG are the Syrian Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (also consisting of a women\u2019s army, the YPJ), an anti-Islamist militia allied with the United States that was largely responsible for the defeat of the Islamic State (ISIS) in Raqqa, the former capital of the jihadist group\u2019s \u201ccaliph.\u201d The PKK is the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, a Marxist terrorist organization. The United States has designated the PKK a terrorist group but cooperates with the YPG; the Turkish government considers them indistinguishable from each other and actively uses troops to antagonize the YPG and keep them far from the Turkish border.\n\nFrance also cooperates with the YPG; Macron hosted leaders of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition featuring Kurdish fighters, in Paris this year.\n\nCavusoglu referred to Macron generally as a \u201crooster crowing while its feet are covered in dirt,\u201d claiming that Macron is cooperating with terrorists by meeting with YPG officials and that the French government has also harassed journalists. His ties to the Kurdish separatists \u2013 who accept neither Islamist rule nor the regime of dictator Bashar al-Assad \u2013 render his criticism invalid, Cavusoglu meant to argue.\n\n\u201cJournalists were excluded from the PACE\u2019s 70th anniversary celebration due to the blockage of France. Also, we know that Macron has shut down the media department in the Elysee,\u201d the Turkish foreign minister said.\n\nIn an extended speech before the Council of Europe on Tuesday, Macron spoke generally about Europe having a responsibility to take in refugees and actively rejected the idea of \u201cabsolute free speech.\u201d\n\nReferring to social media, Macron said that Europe had to \u201cdeal with the issue of public order on the internet\u201d today because the idea of individuals speaking freely into a universally accessible medium was new.\n\n\u201cLiberty is liberty that is expressed through the laws of the sovereign,\u201d he insisted, adding that \u201cthere is no such thing\u201d as \u201cabsolute\u201d freedom of speech.\n\nA week ago, Macron complained about the influx of migrants into France while visiting New York for the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\u201cIf France wants to welcome them, well, it cannot admit everyone,\u201d he lamented. \u201cI made a promise on this issue in July 2017, but we weren\u2019t able to keep this promise.\u201d\n\nMacron has made his commitment to Kurdish fighters in the Middle East a prevalent part of his foreign policy, infuriating Turkey. He hosted members of the SDF in France in April, following the announcement of the complete eradication of the ISIS \u201ccaliphate\u201d from the country. While ISIS remains a threat in Africa and southeast Asia, it no longer holds territory in the heart of the Middle East, save for small pockets in remote locations of Syria and Iraq.\n\nMacron also maintains friendly relations with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) of Iraq, an autonomous region from Baghdad that has diplomatic ties to Ankara. Barzani welcomed Masoud Barzani, the former KRG president, to Paris in September to discuss cooperation.\n\n\u201cPresident Barzani expressed support for the initiative by [French] President Emmanuel Macron on Syria and conveyed his concerns and observations to [Decottignies and his accompanying delegation] about the situation and future of the Kurdish people in Syria,\u201d a statement from Barzani\u2019s political party read following their meeting.\n\nMacron most recently met a KRG representative in New York last week.\n\nMacron also met in person with Erdogan this summer at the G-20 Summit in June, hosted by Japan. Despite the criticism, Turkey and France maintain cordial, if not close, relations.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Turkish Foreign Minister\u00a0Mevlut Cavusoglu accused French President Emmanuel Macron of \"defaming Turkey\" in a speech this week.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/02/Emmanuel-Macron.png", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
