In reality, people with long-term conditions like cancer and dementia spend around 95 per cent of their time adjusting to the symptoms of the condition or the side effects of treatment outside the medical setting.'\n\nThat's where Live Better With comes in, whether it's providing practical solutions like non-medical products - curated by recommendations and categorized intuitively by symptoms - or services, like help with getting travel insurance when all you need to do is get away.\n\nTamara adds: 'We're talking about people living with certain conditions for five, ten or 20 years. There are hundreds of simple things that can make it easier, like relieving fatigue and pain or just breaking down those frustrating barriers that could mean the difference between being able to take your kids to school and get to the supermarket alone.\n\nLive Better With is a revolutionary healthcare platform dedicated to remedies and support that can improve daily life with a range of long-term health conditions\n\n'Sometimes these are the things we take for granted but often they are the little things that give us freedom and quality of life.'\n\nLive Better With is also a safe space for users and their loved ones to read informative articles or guidance about the conditions, written by a community of people overcoming the same daily challenges.\n\nIn four short years, Live Better With has gone from providing support for just one condition, cancer, to two more, menopause and dementia, meaning Tamara and the team are well on their way to the long-term goal of providing a service for every long-term condition.\n\n'Cancer is a condition where we knew we could make a big impact,' Tamara now says of their rapidly expanding network\n\nLive Better With is a consolidated place to find practical solutions, whether it's non-medical products or services, as well as discussion forums and articles offering advice and information\n\n'Cancer is a condition where we knew we could make a really helpful big impact,' Tamara now says of their rapidly expanding network.\n\n'We've seen the community talking about this condition alone quickly grow to over 70,000 people.\n\nPictured is one of the range of bamboo headwear offered by Live Better With to their cancer community\n\n'After that, we wanted to replicate the offering for a very different condition, menopause, where we recognized a significant lack of support in the workplace and a lack of guidance on improving everyday symptoms.\n\n'While it doesn't always come with a traditional medical diagnosis, it's a condition that affects half the world's population at some point in their lives with side-effects that persist over a really long time.'\n\nMost recently, the site has expanded even further to include Live Better With Dementia.\n\nTamara explains: 'It was important to us to provide support for a condition that focuses just as much on the carer as it does on the people living with it.\n\n'Our articles and forums are a particularly important resource and outlet for the loved ones of people living with dementia and we hope that the products will make a huge difference to the ways families and carers can provide support.'\n\nLive Better With now serves an incredible 2.4 million users per year, across over 50 countries.\n\nAnd so far, they have been able to provide 250,000 products to help people living with long-term conditions.\n\n'Our articles and forums are a particularly important resource and outlet for the loved ones of people living with dementia,' Tamara explains\n\nTamara says: 'We set out to solve a problem for people with a long-term condition. Now, it's all about how many of those people we can bring that solution to.\n\n'Our mission is to reach every single person living with a long-term condition, which means LiveBetterWith is dealing with more diverse and underserved conditions, as well as reaching deeper into the communities in countries where we already work.\n\n'Ultimately, it's our communities that enrich our content and drive product curation, so the more people we can reach, the stronger the support we can provide.'\n\nFind out more at the Live Better With website", "description": "Tamara Rajah set out to overcome the forgotten side of care for people with long-term health conditions when she founded Live Better With.", "authors": ["Becky Freeth For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/17/18925966-0-image-a-9_1569429232584.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
