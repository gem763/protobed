It doesn\u2019t travel well through the synapses. You can\u2019t really, fully consider it, the same way you can\u2019t really, fully picture how many stars there are in the universe. And yet, we are periodically forced to grapple with it, as Tom DeLonge and his UFO organisation refuse to stay out of the news.\n\nThis first really came to the fore back in 2017, when the New York Times published an expos\u00e9 on a US Department of Defence UFO program (the \u2018Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program\u2019) that run from 2007 to 2012, which had been run by a man named Luis Elizondo. Elizondo, it turns out, was now working for Tom DeLonge\u2019s new organisation, the To The Stars Academy, which was involved in the release of two separate pieces of footage of US Navy pilots encountering some flying objects that they could not explain. UFOs. Goddamn UFOs.\n\nUntil now, we have not had any official confirmation from the US Government that these videos (and a third one released later) were, in fact, genuine videos of \u2018unexplained aerial phenomena\u2019. UAP seems to be the term preferred by the government, possibly because people instantly conflate UFOs with aliens \u2014 maybe just because it sounds cool.\n\nIn a statement to The Black Vault last week, the US Navy confirmed the dates for the three videos \u2014 November 14, 2004 for the video known as \u2018FLIR1\u2019 and January 21, 2015 for the other two \u2014 and said they still had no idea what they were, describing \u201cthe phenomena contained/depicted\u201d in the videos as \u201cunidentified\u201d.\n\nThe official spokesperson for the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information Warfare, Joseph Gradisher, told The Black Vault that, while the videos had been declassified, the Navy had never cleared them for public release.\n\nWhile a UFO website called The Black Vault might not be the most reliable-sounding source in the world to you, Gradisher confirmed to Motherboard what was was reported by them, which makes this whole thing even more strange.\n\nJust because we can\u2019t identify them doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re aliens but I mean, come on, goddamn. What\u2019s up with these things.", "description": "The US Navy has confirmed that the videos released by the Tom DeLonge UFO organisation The To The Stars Academy are, in fact, real.", "authors": ["Ben Mcleay"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/tom-delonge-is-in-space-636x397.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
