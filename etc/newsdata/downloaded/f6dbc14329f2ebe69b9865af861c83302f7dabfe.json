Pictured are protesters at a demonstration in New York City demanding Trump's impeachment on October 6\n\nThe news came just a week after Fox News published a poll finding that 51% of Americans agreed that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, a nine-point jump from the most recent survey on July 19.\n\nThe president was furious at the Fox poll, tweeting: 'From the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll.\n\n'Whoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days.'\n\nAn earlier wave of the survey, conducted in early September before details about Trump's call with Ukrainian Presdient Volodymr Zelensky were made public, 50 per cent said they favored the House launching impeachment proceedings.\n\nA whopping 93 per cent of Democrats say that Trump has definitely or probably done things that are grounds for impeachment.\n\nWhile a smaller majority of Republicans (80 per cent) say he hasn't.\n\nAnd fewer than half of Republicans say Trump definitely hasn't done things that are grounds for impeachment.", "description": "The new survey by the Pew Research Center polled 3,487 Americans and found that roughly one-in-ten who initially opposed proceedings now approve of them.", "authors": ["Isabella Nikolic For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/16/19888466-0-image-a-63_1571411160446.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
