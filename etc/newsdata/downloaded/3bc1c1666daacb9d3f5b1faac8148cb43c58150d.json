Remainers are seeing whose side Jeremy Corbyn is on.\u201d\n\nJohn Leech, the Lib Dem leader of Manchester council, defended the poster - saying his party were \u201cunapologetically pro-European\u201d and willing to do \u201cabsolutely anything\u201d to stop Brexit.\n\nAt the launch of the campaign in Manchester today, said: \u201cOn more than 30 occasions, Corbyn has ordered his MPs to vote with the Conservatives to deliver Brexit.\n\n\u201cJohnson\u2019s deal is even worse than Theresa May \u2019s, and yet Labour MPs are still lining up to vote for it.\n\n\u201cThere can be no coming back from that, and both MPs and voters must recognise the repercussions of their votes.\u201d", "description": "The ad campaign parodies the famous \"Careless Talk Costs Lives\" poster - but with Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson conspiring on Brexit", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Nicola Bartlett"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20723226.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PROOFLD-Careless-Votes-2-PROOF.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
