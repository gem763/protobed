(Reuters) - The U.S. economy and labor market continue to be strong but there are \u201cseveral headwinds,\u201d particularly uncertainty around trade and politics that affect business confidence, the president of the Richmond Federal Reserve said on Thursday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin poses during a break at a Dallas Fed conference on technology in Dallas, Texas, U.S., May 23, 2019. REUTERS/Ann Saphir/File Photo\n\n\u201cI\u2019m particularly concerned about the roller coaster we\u2019ve been on recently,\u201d Thomas I. Barkin, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told the Risk Management Association in Richmond, Virginia.\n\n\u201cBetween Brexit, the ongoing negotiations with China, tensions in the Middle East and the political headlines,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s been tough for business to feel like they\u2019re on solid ground.\n\nGDP growth has slowed in China and stalled in the Eurozone, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk that weakness will affect us.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, the risk was that the economy seemed to be overheating, he said. The latest market easing \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean a recession is imminent,\u201d he said, \u201cnor that we are in a prolonged period of easing.\u201d\n\nAsked how the Fed handle rate decisions in the future, Barkin said by relying on decisions by consensus, as it always has, a commitment to risk modeling and constantly reviewing and revising how it makes decisions.\n\nBarkin also noted concerns about the rising national debt.\n\n\u201cI do now worry about the impact of today\u2019s large federal budget deficits on our resiliency in the downturn,\u201d he said.\n\nThe United States is luckier than many other countries in this uncertain trade environment because it gets just 18% of its GDP from trade, Barkin said in the audience question and answer session later.\n\nBut if the U.S.-built global trade system starts to falter, it could have a \u201cspiraling effect\u201d on other countries that rely on that system and are more reliant on trade, like South Korea.", "description": "The U.S. economy and labor market continue to be strong but there are \"several headwinds,\" particularly uncertainty around trade and politics that affect business confidence, the president of the Richmond Federal Reserve said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434288292&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P209", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
