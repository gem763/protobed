Skipping back and forth between silliness and sadness, between happiness and horror, it is a film that, even when it isn\u2019t entirely working, astonishes you with its very existence. A feel-good comedy? With children? About anti-Semitism? And Hitler? We won\u2019t be getting many more of those this year.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- Five stars for The Lighthouse\n\n- Ten films to watch this October\n\n- Four stars for Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman\n\nThe charm and offbeat humour of Jojo Rabbit will be familiar to anyone who has seen Waititi\u2019s previous films, including Thor: Ragnarok, Hunt for the Wilderpeople and What We Do in the Shadows. Set in Germany towards the end of World War Two, it\u2019s also vaguely reminiscent of the comedy sketch by British duo Mitchell and Webb in which one SS officer asks another, \u201cAre we the baddies?\u201d The point is that the film\u2019s tiny 10-year-old hero, Johannes Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis), believes that the Nazis are definitely not the baddies. His idea of fun is to learn how to throw knives and burn books while he\u2019s at a Hitler Youth training camp in the woods, and he reveres the F\u00fchrer so much that Adolf, played by Waititi himself, keeps popping up as his imaginary best buddy. The training-camp sequence is hilarious, but there is a grim insight beneath the jokes: for a generation of Germans, learning how to fight for Hitler was an honour and a treat.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen Scarlett Johansson being as touching as she is here\n\nBut maybe Johannes isn\u2019t the Aryan superman the Fatherland needs, after all. He may boast that he is \u201cmassively into swastikas\u201d, but he can\u2019t bring himself to kill a rabbit, which is why the camp instructors land him with the nickname Jojo Rabbit. When he comes home from the camp, his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) doesn\u2019t seem quite as pro-Hitler as she once was, either. Somehow, Johansson continues to be a revelation in role after role. As superb as she always is, I\u2019ve never seen her being as touching as she is here. With the help of a nightly bottle of red wine, Rosie manages to stay positive and playful for the sake of her son, even though her husband has been posted to some distant country and her daughter is dead.\n\nJohannes doesn\u2019t guess his mother\u2019s true feelings until he discovers that she has hidden a teenage Jewish girl, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), in the walls of his late sister\u2019s bedroom. He is appalled \u2013 and slightly surprised that this inhuman monster doesn\u2019t appear to have horns. But once the pair of reluctant housemates get talking, Johannes is forced to question whether everything he has been told about Jews is strictly true. There is even a chance that friendship will conquer fear, and love will conquer hate.\n\nAdapted from Caging Skies, a novel by Christine Leunens, Jojo Rabbit has the plot of a conventional, sentimental Holocaust story, and it isn\u2019t as powerful as it might have been. This isn\u2019t the fault of the two terrific leads: both Davis and McKenzie have the conviction and comic timing to match any adult actor. But it\u2019s clear from the start that Johannes\u2019s heart isn\u2019t really in Nazism \u2013 he\u2019s just too nice \u2013 so his change of attitude towards Elsa doesn\u2019t feel like a world-shaking wrench. Similarly, Elsa is 10 times braver and tougher than he is, so there is none of the jeopardy and suspense that should be part of any film about a fervent young Nazi finding a Jewish girl in his house.\n\nSome viewers will complain that the subject is no laughing matter\n\nPlotting aside, though, the balance between light and darkness is remarkable. Jojo Rabbit is designed and lit to look as warm and cosy as a fairy tale, but then, just when you\u2019re relaxing and enjoying it, it shows a row of executed resistance leaders hanging from a gibbet in the town square. Likewise, the Nazi officers, including a boozy, disillusioned captain played with aplomb by Sam Rockwell, and a priggish Gestapo agent played by Stephen Merchant, can be innocuous in one scene and frightening in the next. But most of the time they are cartoonish fools, speaking English with on-off German accents and using anachronistic slang. Rebel Wilson \u2013 as a camp leader \u2013 gets to mutter \u201cO M Gott\u201d. Waititi\u2019s goofy Hitler cries: \u201cCorrectamundo!\u201d\n\nThe writer-director is cheating, to an extent: if a small boy idolised Hitler, it\u2019s hardly likely that he would imagine him to be the petulant, pot-bellied, baggy-trousered buffoon portrayed here. But you can forgive a little conceptual slipperiness when the results are as funny as Jojo Rabbit. And perhaps in depicting the Nazis as a clueless and immature bunch, the film gets at a truth that more traditional Third Reich dramas miss: however terrifying the Nazis\u2019 ideology might have been, it was also essentially childish nonsense.\n\nSome viewers will complain that the subject is no laughing matter. Waititi\u2019s riposte seems to be that, actually, it is vital that we laugh at Nazis \u2013 and Jojo Rabbit ensures that we do just that.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nLove film?
