McSwain, whose office negotiated the settlement with Drexel.\n\nThe report added that a university spokesperson said the school reported Nwankpa\u2019s suspicious spending and cooperated with the investigation into his misconduct. Drexel has reportedly since established additional training for faculty and staff and has revised its standards with regards to auditing.\n\n\u201cDrexel takes allegations of unethical or unlawful business conduct on the part of any members of the university community very seriously and remains committed to being in full compliance with all billing regulations and requirements,\u201d said spokesperson Niki Gianakaris, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nThe office for U.S. Attorney William M. McSwain mentioned that the settlement did not prevent the prosecution of Nwankpa.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "Drexel University has agreed to settle a lawsuit for $190,000 after one of its professors allegedly used federal funds to cover a decade's worth of his spending habits at local strip clubs.", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/An-exotic-dancer-performs-a-pole-dance-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
