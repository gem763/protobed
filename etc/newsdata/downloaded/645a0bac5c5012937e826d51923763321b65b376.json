But some farms use child labor, harm protected forests.", "language": "en", "text": "For years, the world\u2019s largest chocolate companies \u2014 including Mars, Nestl\u00e9, Hershey and others \u2014 have advertised that their supply chain has been cleared of abuses because they had been \"certified\u201d by one of three auditing organizations: Utz Certified, Fairtrade or Rainforest Alliance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany consumers willingly pay more for chocolate made from certified cocoa, and most of the large companies have pledged to certify most or all of their supply. But problems at Utz Certified, which has approved more cocoa than any other auditing organization, undermines those claims, according to interviews and records reviewed by The Washington Post.\n\nWhile the Utz guidelines are supposed to prevent environmental degradation, a former employee told The Post that many Utz farms were located inside nationally protected forests in Ivory Coast and, in response to questions, an Utz spokesperson confirmed that it has recently discovered more than 4,900 Utz farms located there.\n\nThough Utz has rules against child labor, research reports co-sponsored by the organization in 2013 and 2017 found that Utz certified farms in Ivory Coast were more likely than other farms to have child laborers, with children putting in more work deemed dangerous, such as working with machetes and insecticides.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd earlier this year, Utz discovered significant problems at four auditing firms responsible for approving a large portion of the world\u2019s certified chocolate. The auditing firms cited for problems had conducted audits for most of the farms in Ivory Coast, the world\u2019s largest single source of certified cocoa.\n\nIn 2017, Utz certified 1.5 million tons of cocoa, or about two-thirds of the world\u2019s supply of certified cocoa, according to industry statistics. Every year, it certifies the crops from hundreds of thousands of West African farmers.\n\n\u201cConsumers believe that by buying certified cocoa they are doing something good for the environment, or children, or farmers,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Ruf, a researcher based in Ivory Coast and a co-author of a 2013 study co-sponsored by Utz. \u201cBut that is a fiction.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA Post story in June documented widespread child labor on West African cocoa farms, including working with machetes and pesticides, despite years of promises by the chocolate industry to eradicate it. The industry also has been blamed for a role in the region\u2019s epochal deforestation. The certification programs, which the major chocolate companies embraced several years ago, were supposed to address those problems.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou now have to ask, \u2018what is the point of \u201ccertification\u201d of cocoa?\u2019 \u201d said Etelle Higonnet, senior campaign director for Mighty Earth, an environmental group trying to stop deforestation. \u201cThey\u2019re trashing the forests, and they don\u2019t pay farmers a living income.\u201d\n\nShe said the group had asked Utz officials before about certified farms being carved out of protected forests, but didn\u2019t get an answer. The admission that more than 4,900 certified Utz farms were located inside protected forests is outrageous, she said.\n\nAD\n\nUtz declined to offer specifics about the problems at each of the four auditing firms in Ivory Coast, citing confidentiality agreements. But in a March letter, a portion of which was disclosed to The Post, Utz found that one inspecting firm had \u201cinsufficient audit activities, repetitive bad audit management practices, and poor certification decisions which are alarming.\u201d\n\nThe problems, the Utz letter said, \u201cput at risk the credibility of the certification decision and therefore the credibility of the UTZ program.\u201d\n\nDeficiencies found at two other auditing firms were deemed of equal severity \u2014 described as a \u201cyellow card\u201d \u2014 and the infractions at the fourth were categorized as even graver by Utz officials, a so-called \u201cred card.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn response to questions regarding these troubles, officials with Utz Certified, which last year merged with Rainforest Alliance, emphasized that the problems were discovered during \u201cnormal monitoring.\u201d The monitoring did not lead to sanctions of any farmers or co-ops, and no approvals for any batch of cocoa were rescinded.\n\nRegarding the finding of more child labor on its farms, Utz said: \u201cThe whole picture is a bit more complicated.\u201d It said that there were more reports of child labor on Utz farms because those farmers have \u201cmore awareness\u201d of the problem. Researchers who conducted the survey, however, said that they took steps in their questionnaire to eliminate any such effects.\n\nUtz officials also noted that while the organization had approved 4,900 farms located inside nationally protected forests according to the most recent maps, that represents only a small portion of the roughly 423,000 farms it approves in Ivory Coast annually. The map review that identified Utz farms inside the protected forests, however, is only partially complete.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally, asked about reports from former Utz employees who said auditors are sometimes solicited with bribes, and other times threatened with violence, the Utz officials indicated that corruption in the system was limited.\n\n\u201cIn its fifteen-year history, UTZ Certified has investigated only isolated cases of corruption,\u201d the organization said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge that things must change,\u201d the organization said in a statement to The Post. \u201cA certification system must adapt and innovate in order to create more impact and provide more value to producers and companies. We have worked consistently to improve our standards, assurance mechanisms and associated interventions \u2014 and will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u2018Unquestionably a challenge\u2019\n\nThe chocolate companies that have boasted of their commitment to buying certified cocoa emphasized, in response to this story, that the certification efforts have helped in less measurable ways \u2014 they\u2019ve trained farmers, for example \u2014 and that their efforts to halt environmental and labor abuses go beyond certification. Three of the companies issued statements in response to this story.\n\nAD\n\nHershey: \u201cAuditing cocoa farms in West Africa, which represents millions of farmers spread across more than 100,000 square miles, is unquestionably a challenge. Before certifiers went into West Africa several years ago, it had never been attempted. The fact that it is a challenge and the processes aren\u2019t perfect doesn\u2019t mean the work is not worthwhile.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFerrero: In addition to certification efforts, \u201cFerrero Group has monitoring and control systems \u2026 and invests in community-based initiatives that address the systemic issues driving deforestation and child labor: poverty, lack of basic necessities, and other social problems.\u201d\n\nMars: \u201cOur aim is to ensure 100 percent of our cocoa is responsibly sourced and traceable by 2025 and we will continue to work with farming communities, suppliers, governments and others to do so. In 2018, Mars launched its Cocoa for Generations strategy, calling for more demanding standards than certification sets today.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOfficials with Nestl\u00e9 declined to comment.\n\nThe chocolate industry began to embrace certification programs about 10 years ago as a response to two nightmarish public relations issues: First, more than 2 million child laborers were reported to be working on cocoa farms in West Africa, and second, satellite images suggested that those farms were responsible for some of the region\u2019s cataclysmic wreckage of tropical forests.\n\n\u201cWe think that this is what we are supposed to do as a responsible world citizen,\u201d a Mars official said in April 2009 as it announced that it was moving toward 100 percent certified cocoa. Mars and most of the other companies continue to tout similar certification goals.\n\nCocoa is considered certified if one of three nonprofit organizations \u2014 Utz Certified, Rainforest Alliance and Fairtrade \u2014 are willing to grant it their label \u2014 their seal of approval. The organizations set out rules for farms to follow and then authorize independent auditing firms to check for compliance. In the end, certification offers a little to everyone: Farmers who comply with the rules can advertise that their cocoa is certified and fetch a price premium of as much as 10 percent or more; companies pay a little extra for the cocoa, but it adds some oversight to their cocoa supply chain; and consumers feel better about their chocolate.\n\nAD\n\nOf the three certification groups, Utz, the Dutch label, rapidly became the leader in cocoa, at least in part because the organization had aimed at making Utz attractive enough to reach beyond the niche markets.\n\nThe organization began as a certification label for coffee \u2014 the original name was Utz Kapeh, a phrase that means \u201cgood coffee\u201d in a Mayan language. It moved into cocoa in 2008.\n\nThe goal was to bring sustainability to mainstream cocoa production, with chief executive Han de Groot saying, \u201cmaking a meaningful impact would only be possible if we could reach massive volumes.\u201d Accordingly, the organization took several steps to entice big companies.\n\nFor one thing, the price of Utz cocoa was right: The \u201cpremium\u201d that cocoa buyers paid for Utz certified cocoa was significantly lower than what buyers paid for Fairtrade cocoa \u2014 sometimes just half as much, according to figures published by the labels. Several food industry executives served on the Utz board, among them two former executives from Cargill, a major cocoa buyer.\n\nLast year, about 65 percent of the world\u2019s certified cocoa bore the Utz label.\n\n\u201cWhen you buy Utz Certified,\u201d according to the organization\u2019s slogan, \u201cyou are helping build a better future.\u201d\n\nFour auditing firms cited\n\nWhile the word \u201ccertification\u201d may suggest rigorous enforcement, however, the inspections are patchy and the incentives for fraud considerable, according to interviews with former Utz employees.\n\nThe recent trouble in Ivory Coast highlighted just how critical these problems can be.\n\nIvory Coast is the main source of Utz certified cocoa, and the four auditing firms cited by Utz for auditing problems were responsible for about 90 percent of the Utz farms there, according to figures provided to The Post.\n\nTwo of those auditing firms are based in Africa \u2014 AfriCert and Bureau Norme Audit; two others, Control Union and Bureau Veritas, are based in Europe. The auditing companies involved revealed little about why they received warnings from Utz.\n\nUtz \u201cfound that our local auditors had failed to investigate thoroughly the non-compliances found,\u201d Udi Gabay, regional manager in Africa for Control Union, the auditing firm received the most severe warning from Utz, said in a statement. \u201cThis was the result [of] a lack of supervision by local management.\u201d\n\nControl Union is seeking to be reauthorized as an Utz inspector.\n\nA representative of AfriCert referred questions to Utz Certified.\n\nA Bureau Veritas representative, said that there had been \u201cweaknesses at the auditors level.\u201d\n\nA representative of Bureau Norme Audit said the firm remains a fully certified auditor for Utz.\n\nThe sanctions do not \u201cmean that all activities (audits, certification decisions) were conducted incorrectly,\u201d Utz said in a statement.\n\nEven when the auditing firms are operating properly, however, the inspection system allows many farms to go unchecked.\n\nAt Utz \u2014 as at other certifiers \u2014 when a group of farmers seeks certification, only a small sample of the farms are actually inspected. For a typical co-op of 1,000 farmers seeking Utz certification, for example, auditors might only inspect about 32. Audits are generally announced in advance, a practice that allows farmers to hide evidence of any deviations from the rules.\n\nOnce at the farm, inspectors often face an array of challenges, according to former employees, beginning with the fact that farmers have a substantial financial incentive to fool the auditors: If they pass muster with Utz, they may receive about $80 extra per metric ton of cocoa they sell.\n\nLenneke Braam, who until June was head of standards and assurance at Utz and Rainforest Alliance, noted that the pressures on auditors can be extreme, including not just enticements such as bribes, but also death threats.\n\n\u201cHow many I cannot say,\u201d she said of the death threats. \u201cBut it happens.\u201d\n\nAt the root of the problem is the desperation of the farmers, said Lucas Simons, who was global program director at Utz in 2008. The question, he said, is whether the high-minded certification guidelines drafted in Europe or the United States can be enforced in a setting where illiteracy and poverty are widespread, and where basic infrastructure \u2014 roads and electricity \u2014 are often missing.\n\n\u201cThese people are poor \u2014 for them it\u2019s a matter of survival,\u201d Simons explained. \u201cIf people cannot read or write, if they make just 70 cents a day, and we come with 35 pages of requirements that they must meet, we are not creating a sustainable economy.\u201d\n\nMarginal difference between farms\n\nEven some of Utz\u2019s own research provides further evidence that the inspection system is weak: In key ways, the farms that it approves in West Africa are little different from those that are not certified.\n\nTwice, in 2013 and again in 2017, researchers from Wageningen University & Research surveyed hundreds of farmers in Ivory Coast and compared farmers certified by Utz to those who were not certified.\n\nThe results were not flattering.\n\nOn the issue of child labor, the Utz-certified farmers had more child laborers than farmers who lacked certification. About 14 percent of noncertified farmers told surveyors they had child labor; about 16 percent of Utz-certified farmers did.\n\nOn environmental issues, the researchers studied general practices, planting of shade trees and waste management. There were some ways that Utz farms looked better: Utz farmers were more likely to have planted shade trees, which are a recommended means to counter deforestation. The researchers also credited the certification program with disseminating agricultural knowledge beyond Utz farms.\n\nBut overall, the studies found, the \u201clevels of impacts have generally been marginal for certified farmers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere remains a gap between what certification alone has been expected to deliver and [what] actually has been delivered,\u201d according to an academic paper the researchers published.\n\nOther researchers were more blunt.\n\nCharity Ryerson, co-founder of the nonprofit Corporate Accountability Lab, visited five cocoa villages in Ivory Coast over the past year and found little evidence of anyone checking that \u201ccertified\u201d farms were operating according to standards. For example, she said, a checklist requiring clean bathrooms was fully checked in one report even though none of the farms have bathrooms.\n\n\"From our experience talking to farmers, it was clear that certification meant almost nothing,\" Ryerson said. \"It's an open secret in the Ivory Coast that almost no one checks the certified farms for compliance.\"\n\n\u201cCertification misleads consumers to believe that farmers earn a living wage, their children go to school, and labor conditions are decent. From the perspective of a farmer living in abject poverty, this is morally outrageous.\u201d", "description": "For several years, the world's largest chocolate companies have assured consumers that their cocoa comes from \"certified\" sources that are audited for child labor and environmental infractions.
