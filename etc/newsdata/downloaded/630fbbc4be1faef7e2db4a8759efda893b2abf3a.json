Rather, it detects the start of an earthquake and calculates location, intensity and sends alerts to areas where shaking is likely to occur from quakes of magnitude 4.5 or greater.\n\nThe alerts have been in development for years and last year were made broadly available to businesses, utilities, schools and other entities.\n\nLarge-scale public notification has been available for Los Angeles County since the start of the year through an app developed for the city of Los Angeles, but it hasn\u2019t been triggered yet.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Earthquake early warning alerts will become publicly available throughout California this week, the Governor's Office of Emergency Services said Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Antczak"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
