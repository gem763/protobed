Hopefully we will keep him out here.\n\n\u2018Obviously he loses his accreditation, but since he\u2019s gone so far in the tournament it will be nice for him to stay out for the next couple of weeks.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re just going through that with him. It\u2019s very disappointing for him as he\u2019s been very influential and important for us in the last year.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s disappointing to have a player ruled out, but in saying that these games are so physical and to have only one player ruled out at this stage is a real positive for us.\n\nNavidi is tackled by French hooker Guilhem Guirado before going to ground on Sunday\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve been pretty lucky and that\u2019s been the whole experience since 2015 \u2013 about creating depth in the squad and trying to keep everyone as healthy as we possibly can.\u2019\n\nAnd on Williams, who has played three sets of 80 minutes for the Ospreys in the new Pro14 season back home, potentially coming in, Gatland added: \u2018He\u2019s been playing rugby and been playing so he\u2019s available.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s absolutely in contention. We\u2019ve got a meeting tonight to decide who that potential replacement will be. There are a number of options.'\n\nWales face South Africa in the World Cup semi-final on Sunday in Yokohama - it is just the third time they have ever made the last four.", "description": "The Wales flanker, 28, was taken off in the 28th minute of the 20-19 win in Oita on Sunday, and has now been ruled out of the tournament with a grade two tear.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/11/19986910-0-image-a-49_1571654972962.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
