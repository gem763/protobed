Didn\u2019t he slap his business partner, the accountant Leo Bloom, after dousing the poor man with a glass of water during working hours? And while Max\u2019s hanky-panky with Ulla, the receptionist, may have involved consenting adults, his whole business model was based on trading sexual favors with senior citizens for money. If ever a man in show business was in need of cancellation, it was surely Max Bialystock.\n\nNot a chance! Max is a beloved figure who has, for more than 50 years, inspired not outrage but delight. The man is an institution, an archetype. He turned a song-and-dance spectacle about Hitler into a Broadway smash. Hitler! Max\u2019s exploits have been chronicled in a 2005 movie and a long-running stage musical, both called \u201cThe Producers\u201d and both starring Nathan Lane. Long before that, Max was played by Zero Mostel, in the first film directed by Mel Brooks. That original \u201cProducers,\u201d released in 1967 with a very young Gene Wilder as Leo, was a staple of my youth.\n\nNow that fascism seems to be in bloom once again, it is a good time to revisit \u201cSpringtime for Hitler,\u201d the show that made Bialystock and Brooks into household names. But like Leo when he first shuffles into Max\u2019s office to audit the books, I\u2019m a little nervous at the prospect.\n\nThe question of how much and what kind of fun it\u2019s permissible to have with Nazis never goes away, and the resurgence of right-wing extremism around the world makes the question newly uncomfortable. When \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d showed up at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, the fact that it played Hitler at least partly for laughs \u2014 with the director, Taika Waititi impersonating a goofy, gangly, almost lovable F\u00fchrer \u2014 you could hear the wincing from across the border. The relative innocuousness of the film (which won the audience award at the festival) doesn\u2019t entirely dispel the uneasiness around it .", "description": "More than a half-century after Mel Brooks made \u201cThe Producers,\u201d mocking Hitler isn\u2019t what it used to be.", "authors": ["A.O.
