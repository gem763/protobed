It lasts nearly three hours, with multiple-choice questions covering English, math, reading and science. An optional essay-writing prompt takes 40 minutes more. About 1.9 million U.S. students in the Class of 2018 took the ACT.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCollege admission test scores raise warning signs about math achievement\n\nThe ACT\u2019s rival is the College Board\u2019s SAT (maximum score 1600), which last year reclaimed the lead in market share for admission testing. Selective colleges accept either test. Some students send results from both.\n\nIn another significant shift Tuesday, the ACT testing organization disclosed it is starting to offer online testing for students who sit for the exam on Saturdays \u2014 enabling them to get results in as few as two business days. Those who take the paper-and-pencil version often wait about three weeks.\n\nThe faster that students receive scores, the faster they can use that information in assembling a list of potential colleges and making decisions about test retakes.\n\nAD\n\nOnline testing is now the norm for students who take the ACT overseas. Some public school systems \u2014 notably in Oklahoma, Arkansas and South Carolina \u2014 administer the ACT online during school days. ACT chief executive Marten Roorda said online testing offers security advantages. \u201cPaper is something that can get stolen or lost,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nPaper-and-pencil testing will remain widely available, the ACT said, but the digital method will expand over time.\n\nIn a third policy shift, ACT will enable students, starting in September, to choose to send colleges an official report, drawn on results from multiple tries at the test, known as a \u201csuperscore.\u201d\n\nUsed by many colleges, superscoring credits students with their best result on each of the four sections if they have been tested more than once. Many colleges allow applicants to self-report ACT or SAT scores, using the superscoring format. But the ACT\u2019s policy shift will give the format additional legitimacy through official score reports.\n\nAD\n\nSuperscoring will not be the only option for official reports. Some universities ask students to send the results of all testing sessions. Others ask for the result of their best testing session.\n\nAD\n\nACT officials said their research recently found that superscoring does not reduce the power of the test to predict how students will perform when they enter college. Researchers reported in July that superscoring may be a better predictor than other ways of communicating test results.\n\nThose students \u201cwho are willing to forgo multiple Saturdays to sit for a multiple-hour test with the hope of maybe increasing their score are also the students who are likely to ask questions in their college courses, visit their professor during office hours, and take advantage of any extra credit opportunities to ensure the best possible grade,\u201d ACT researchers Krista Mattern and Justine Radunzel wrote.\n\nAD\n\nACT officials shared details of the initiatives with reporters Monday on the condition that they not contact outsiders for comment until the announcement became public early Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nRoorda said the ACT consulted with colleges, educators, parents and students as it developed the changes. There was especially strong support for allowing students to target specific sections for retesting, he said. \u201cWe want to make it a better experience and create more options,\u201d he said. \u00adRoorda said he expects that taking part of the test will cost less than taking the full version. Exactly how much less remains to be decided.\n\nThis school year, the standard ACT charge is $52 per session, or $68 with the writing option. Fee waivers are available to qualified students in financial need.\n\nAD\n\nUnder the ACT\u2019s new policy, students must take the full test before they can choose a partial retake of one or more sections. Retakes of specific sections, including the optional writing test, will be available only through online testing centers, not in the paper-and-pencil format. Students with disabilities who qualify for extended time or other testing accommodations on the ACT will also be able to use the partial-retake option.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news\n\nAD", "description": "Testing officials announced the change Tuesday, aiming to give students more options for raising scores.", "authors": ["Nick Anderson", "Reporter Covering Higher Education", "National Education Policy", "The Global Education Market"], "top_image": "https://washingtonpost.com/pf/resources/images/favicon.ico?d=120", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
