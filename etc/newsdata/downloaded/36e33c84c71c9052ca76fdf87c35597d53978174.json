The more you pay in taxes, the less of your returns you get to keep.\n\nWith the right strategy, however, it\u2019s possible to minimize the amount of taxes you pay on your investments. Certain investments are not subject to taxation, and investments placed in certain tax advantaged retirement accounts will likewise be shielded from some taxes. As you build your portfolio, consider including these seven options for minimizing taxes.\n\n1. Municipal Bonds\n\nMunicipal bonds, or muni bonds for short, are bonds issued by local governments that are used to fund various projects, such as improving roads or building schools. When you invest in a municipal bond, you\u2019re effectively loaning money to the government. The benefit to you is that you earn a guaranteed rate of return in the form of interest payments from the bond. Even better, these interest payments are exempt from federal taxes. A tax exemption may also apply to any state or local taxes on interest earnings as well.\n\nMunicipal bonds do have certain risks and downsides. Inflation, for instance, can affect the interest rate and your subsequent rate of return. And interest from some municipal bonds are subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). But there\u2019s very little risk of default, and the ability to generate consistent income in your portfolio on a tax-free basis makes them a great addition to a fixed-income portfolio.\n\n2. Tax-Exempt Mutual Funds\n\nA mutual fund is a collection of securities; it may consist entirely of stocks or bonds, or include some combination of the two. The fund either tracks an index or is managed by a professional, offering the opportunity for hands-off investing.\n\nCertain mutual funds are assigned tax-exempt status, meaning you wouldn\u2019t pay taxes on the returns these funds deliver. A tax-exempt mutual fund typically holds municipal bonds and other government securities. This type of fund can offer tax benefits, along with simplified diversification across different types of government securities.\n\nBefore you invest, consider how much of a return a tax-exempt fund may offer. And don\u2019t forget to check the expense ratio to make sure you\u2019re not losing too much in management fees.\n\n3. Tax-Exempt Exchange-Traded Funds\n\nHere are tax-free investments that could grow your portfolio. More\n\nExchange-traded funds are similar to mutual funds, but they trade on an exchange like a stock. Many ETFs take a passive management approach, meaning the assets within the fund don\u2019t turn over as often as they would with an actively managed fund. Many ETFs, in fact, just track an index rather than have a fund manager choose securities. This, in turn, can make the fund management costs lower.\n\nLike mutual funds, ETFs can also be municipal bond-focused, which provides the same tax-exempt benefit. There are short-, mid- and long-term tax-exempt bond ETFs you can invest in, depending on your time horizon and goals. Similar to tax-exempt mutual funds, pay attention to the fees you\u2019re paying to invest in a tax-free ETF.\n\n4. Indexed Universal Life Insurance\n\nYou may not think of life insurance an an investment, but your policy could yield some tax benefits in your portfolio.\n\nGenerally, life insurance benefits are tax-free when paid to the policy\u2019s beneficiaries. If you have a permanent policy that accumulates cash value, such as indexed universal life insurance (IUL), that cash value can earn interest over time tax-free. And unlike retirement accounts, you don\u2019t have to be pushing 60 to withdraw from it, as tax-free loans can be taken out at any age without penalty\u2014all while offering a death benefit.\n\nIUL can be a more expensive insurance coverage option than term life or even whole life policies. But if you\u2019re looking for a relatively risk-free way to earn tax-exempt gains, an IUL policy could be right for you\n\nStory continues", "description": "Investing can be a powerful way to grow your savings over time, but the downside is that you generally have to pay taxes on your investment gains.
