Juvenile justice advocates were shocked, calling the charges \"extremely uncommon.\"\n\n'Extremely uncommon': 9-year-old charged with murder after 5 die in Illinois fire\n\nThis photo taken April 7, 2019, shows melted vinyl siding hanging off the side of a trailer home at 14 Cypress Court in the Timberline Mobile Home Park northeast of Goodfield. (Photo: Matt Dayhoff, AP)\n\nJudge Charles Feeney read the charges to the boy, but when asked if he understood the charges, the boy shook his head, the Tribune reports.\n\nAt one point, the boy's attorney, Peter Dluski, told the judge that his client didn't understand the meaning of \"alleged\" or \"arson,\" the Tribune reports.\n\nWhen the hearing adjourned, the boy began sobbing, and his grandfather escorted him out, according to the Peoria Journal Star.\n\nThe April 6 fire killed a 1-year-old, two 2-year-olds, a 34-year-old man and a 69-year-old woman near the town of Goodfield, about 150 miles southwest of Chicago. The victims\u2014 all family members \u2014 died of smoke inhalation.\n\nThe fire began shortly after 11 p.m. on a Saturday, according to the Star. By the time firefighters arrived on the scene minutes later, the trailer was engulfed in flames\n\nWoodford County Coroner Tim Ruestman has said that the fire was started intentionally.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, whose representatives attended the hearing Monday, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The boy has been in DCFS custody since the fire.\n\nThe boy's mother, Katie Alwood, spoke to several media outlets in defense of her son before the judge placed a gag order on the case.\n\n\"Everyone is looking at him like he's some kind of monster, but that's not who he is,\" Alwood told CBS News. \"People make mistakes, and that's what this is. Yes, it was a horrible tragedy, but it's still not something to throw his life away over.\"\n\nKatie Alwood, left, and her mother, Lori Alwood, plant flowers April 17, 2019 near the Goodfield mobile home, in background, where five relatives died in an April 6 fire.

Therapy and counseling would be likely, but incarceration is not an option, he said.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, if the child is so young that he doesn\u2019t understand court proceedings, he\u2019s probably too young to be charged with murder,\u201d said Chicago-based juvenile defense lawyer Gus Kostopoulos.\n\nNo child as young as this one has been accused in a mass killing since at least 2006, according to the AP/USA TODAY/Northeastern University mass murder database, which tracks all U.S. homicides since then in which four or more people were killed, not including the offender.\n\nThe judge set another court date in November, the Tribune reports.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/22/goodfield-illinois-fire-boy-charged-murder-appears-court/4063618002/", "description": "A\u00a09-year-old boy charged with murder in a Goodfield, Illinois mobile home fire that killed five appeared in court Monday.", "authors": ["Grace Hauck", "Published P.M.
