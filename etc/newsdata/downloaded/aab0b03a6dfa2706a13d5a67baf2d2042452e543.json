But today\u2019s choir are linked by a different modern institution \u2013 the foodbank.\n\nBritain\u2019s first foodbank choir are not singing for their supper, but raising awareness of the End Hunger UK campaign. And there\u2019s also something deeper at work \u2013 the solidarity of song.\n\nJacqui, a 51-year-old mum of three, says she used to think choirs weren\u2019t for people like her. \u201cWhen I was younger, I really struggled, I know what it\u2019s like not to be able to buy enough food for your kids,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI caught my daughter trying to pull her tooth out once \u2013 she said she wanted to get \u00a31 from the tooth fairy so she could give it to me. How heartbreaking is that?\u201d\n\nToni Lawless, 46, is performing a solo today. \u201cI\u2019ve been homeless myself in the past, so I know what it\u2019s like to be hungry,\u201d she says.\n\nAs the choir sing an emotional song about going hungry, Jamie Davies holds up a homemade banner that simply says \u201c Universal Credit isn\u2019t working\u201d.\n\nThe Bishop of Sheffield, the Right Revd Dr Pete Wilcox, says: \u201cIt is an outrage that in our United Kingdom \u2013 one of the most prosperous nations on Earth, one of the most prosperous nations in history \u2013 hundreds of \u00adthousands of people every week live in food poverty, unable to feed themselves in a way that is healthy and reliable and which does not involve making fundamental choices between food and clothing, food and fuel, food and shelter.\u201d\n\nBacked by dozens of protests including at an orchard in Cornwall, a Welsh castle, the Peterloo Monument in Manchester and Tower Bridge in London, the End Hunger UK coalition is calling for a Government-led plan across all departments to free millions from hunger.\n\nMeanwhile, Trussell Trust figures show half of the public has taken action themselves on hunger in the last 12 months, with more than a third donating to a foodbank.\n\nThe Government is sadly lagging behind the electorate, doing nothing to help the issues repeatedly shown to cause UK hunger \u2013 a torn and brutalised welfare system and poverty wages.\n\n\u201cHunger in the UK isn\u2019t about food. It\u2019s about money, and people not having enough of it,\u201d says Emma Revie, chief executive of the Trussell Trust.\n\nNiall Cooper, chairman of End Hunger UK, puts it another way: \u201cThe UK has no shortage of food. The problem is one of incomes.\u201d\n\nThe moving and hopeful Food Glorious Food choir symbolises some of the contradiction of our national hunger crisis. Foodbanks exist because the \u2018Big Society\u2019 has been deliberately used to replace Britain\u2019s social safety net.\n\nBut, while they shouldn\u2019t exist, they are often extraordinary and life-changing \u2013 providing not just food, but often a new family.\n\nA few days, ago, we caught up with the choir at rehearsals at the Gleadless Estate, home to 4,000 residents and a well-used foodbank. Cradling his baby daughter Olivia, Jamie was singing Let It Be.\n\nLike many beside him \u2013 mums, pensioners, neighbours, friends \u2013 he never thought he\u2019d perform in public. \u201cI love singing and so does my daughter,\u201d he said. \u201cShe never stops trying to join in.\u201d\n\nHe and his partner, Madison, 31, moved to Sheffield when Olivia was just 10 days old. They didn\u2019t know anyone, and while they were getting settled were transferred over to Universal Credit.\n\nLike lots of families they were left struggling on \u00a320 child benefit a week.\n\nThen a leaflet advertising the local foodbank came through the letterbox.\n\n\u201cThey fed us, gave us baby food, nappies, even a buggy, but more than that we got to know everyone, we met all these lovely people,\u201d Jamie said.\n\n\u201cUsing a foodbank, it doesn\u2019t make you feel good, you feel ashamed. But singing is the opposite, it makes you feel like a different person, like you\u2019ve got more to offer.\u201d\n\nMum Clare Day, 39, visits the foodbank as a service user and a volunteer.\n\nA former retail worker, she now relies on disability benefits. \u201cLike a lot of people, after I\u2019d paid all my bills I didn\u2019t always have enough for food,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve never used a foodbank you don\u2019t realise what it means to people. It isn\u2019t just people on benefits, it\u2019s used by a lot of people who are working.\n\n\u201cThe first time you come, you feel like everyone is looking at you. But the people here lift you up.\u201d\n\nWhile volunteers began cooking up a three-course lunch in the kitchen, choir leader Yo Tozer-Loft, 49, said the choir helps counteract the stigma of the foodbank. \u201cIt\u2019s about people\u2019s overall wellbeing,\u201d she said. \u201cSinging together is a communal experience \u2013 our hearts actually start beating together when we sing together.\n\n\u201cHere, people aren\u2019t foodbank users, they are singers.\u201d\n\nYou can learn more here .", "description": "The chorus at Sheffield Cathedral is raising awareness of the End Hunger UK campaign", "authors": ["Ros Wynne Jones", "Claire Donnelly"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20642450.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS193761620.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
