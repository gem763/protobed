Former China chief Jun Seki, who was widely seen as one of the top contenders for the CEO job, will be vice COO, the company said.\n\nThe three will take the helm of a company that has been shaken by turmoil following the downfall of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn last year and the departure of former CEO Hiroto Saikawwa\n\n\"Strong leadership is required,\" Yasushi Kimura, Nissan's chairman, told a news conference. \"Group leadership, where they all support each other, will be more transparent.\"\n\nDirectors at Nissan, including those from top shareholder Renault SA, voted unanimously in favour of the two executives, a source said.\n\nGhosn is awaiting trial in Tokyo on financial misconduct charges that he denies.\n\nSaikawa was forced to step down after he admitted to being improperly overpaid.\n\nThe internal strife also has implications for Nissan's often difficult relationship with Renault.\n\nUchida was not seen as one of the frontrunners in the race to be the next chief executive, Reuters has reported.\n\nThe India-born Gupta is currently COO of alliance junior partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
