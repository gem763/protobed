The Straits Times\n\nAsian countries are amongst the most ill-prepared to deal with the double threat of ageing populations and increasing workplace automation, a study has found.\n\nIn the region, Singapore was found to be the best prepared, ranking at 13th place on the Ageing and Automation Resilience Index released on Wednesday (Sept 18). Globally, the top three best-prepared countries were Denmark, Australia and Sweden.\n\nOut of 20 major global economies, Japan, China and South Korea ranked among the lowest at 17th, 18th and 20th respectively.\n\nMercer\n\nThe index ranks countries\u2019 resilience and ability to manage ageing and automation by analysing the mitigating factors a country has in place to tackle the twin challenges, together with the strength of its retirement system.\n\nMitigating factors include higher older worker labour force participation, an adequate level of pension fund assets, favourable socio-economic conditions, and appropriate policy and legal conditions.\n\nAccording to the report by Mercer and Marsh & McLennan Insights, Asian economies were had \u201cvery high\u201d labour workforce participation rate for those aged 65 and above.\n\nCompared to the global average of 14.7 per cent, South Korea\u2019s elderly participation rate was more than double at 31.7 per cent, while Singapore\u2019s was 26.8 per cent, China\u2019s was 21.5 per cent, and Japan\u2019s stood at 23.5 per cent.\n\nThe report estimated that 35 per cent of Singapore\u2019s working-age population will be above the age of 50 by 2030.\n\nReasons that make older workers stay on in the workforce include a retirement savings gap, personal motivation and renewed abilities, thanks to better healthcare and less physically demanding job scopes.\n\nMercer\u2019s report also found that out of 15 selected economies, Singapore had the largest difference in average risk of automation between old and young workers. This means that jobs done by Singapore\u2019s older workers were the most disproportionately more vulnerable to automation than jobs done by its younger workers.\n\nHowever, Singapore was not unique in this, as 13 of the 15 nations\u2019 older workers were at disproportionately higher risk of automation compared with younger workers.\n\nOlder workers were at disproportionately higher risk of automation compared with younger workers in most of the 15 selected countries. Mercer\n\n\u201cIt is crucial that private and public-sector systems work together to facilitate the transition of older workers into either retirement or renewed work using these mechanisms,\u201d the report said, adding that failing to reinvest the returns from automation into workers would result in \u201cserious fallouts\u201d such as social and income inequality and pressure on pension systems.\n\nMercer\u2019s CEO for Asia, Renee McGowan, said olderr workers are \u201cnow more than ever faced with the risk of losing their jobs to automation, endangering their ability to finance their longevity\u201d.\n\n\u201cBusinesses need to better leverage their experienced workforce, with people more willing and able to work past the age of 65,\u201d she said.\n\nThe report said employers can also help employees to recalibrate and plan in order to prepare them for transition rather than be disrupted by it. This includes creating career path assessments around employees\u2019 financial decision making, physical health and future career opportunities, as well as targeted skills-gap training regardless of age.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - 35% of Singapore's working-age population will be above the age of 50 by 2030..
