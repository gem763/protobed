They live in Louisville (LOO'-iss-vihl).\n\nThey pleaded guilty in August to two counts of negligent child abuse causing serious injury. Prosecutors reduced the charges in return for the Krutinas' guilty pleas.\n\nThe charges stem from the death of their 6-month-old daughter, Samantha. The Krutinas took her and her twin sister, Charlotte, to a hospital on Sept. 1, 2018. Both were underweight, and Samantha died.\n\nAn autopsy showed that Samantha died of a bacterial infection caused by malnourishment.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
