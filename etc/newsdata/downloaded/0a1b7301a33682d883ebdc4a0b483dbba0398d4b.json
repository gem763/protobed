REUTERS/Eason Lam\n\nPresident Tsai Ing-wen also vowed in a National Day speech to defend Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty, saying her government would safeguard freedom and democracy as Beijing ramps up pressure on the self-ruled island it considers a wayward province.\n\nTsai, who is seeking re-election in January amid criticism of her policy towards China, referred to the arrangement for the return of the former British colony of Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997 as a failure.\n\nHong Kong has been hit by months of anti-government protests triggered by widespread resentment of what many city residents see as relentless efforts by Beijing to exert control of their city despite the promises of autonomy.\n\nChina has proposed that Taiwan be brought under Chinese rule under a similar arrangement, but Tsai said Beijing\u2019s policies towards the island were a danger to regional stability.\n\n\u201cChina is still threatening to impose its \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 model for Taiwan. Their diplomatic offensives and military coercion pose a serious challenge to regional stability and peace,\u201d Tsai said.\n\n\u201cWhen freedom and democracy are challenged, and when the Republic of China\u2019s existence and development are threatened, we must stand up and defend ourselves,\u201d Tsai said, referring to Taiwan by its official name.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming consensus among Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people is our rejection of \u2018one country, two systems,\u2019 regardless of party affiliation or political position.\u201d\n\nTaiwan\u2019s National Day, marking the anniversary of the start of a 1911 uprising that led to the end of dynastic rule in China and the founding of a republic, was celebrated in Taipei with singing, dancing and parades.\n\nCold War hostility between the island and the mainland had eased over the past decade or so as both sides focused more on expanding business ties, but relations have cooled considerably since Tsai took office in 2016.\n\nChina suspects Tsai and her independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party of pushing for the island\u2019s formal independence, and this year threatened it with war if there was any such move.\n\nTsai denies seeking independence and reiterated that she would not unilaterally change the status quo with China.\n\nFLASHPOINT\n\nDespite her assurances, Beijing has stepped up pressure on the island to seek \u201creunification\u201d and backed up its warnings by flying regular bomber patrols around it.\n\nBeijing also says Taiwan does not have the right to state-to-state relations and is keen to isolate it diplomatically.\n\nSeven countries have severed diplomatic ties with the Taiwan and switched allegiance to Beijing since Tsai coming to power. It now has formal diplomatic ties with just 15 nations.\n\nBut Tsai said Taiwan was undaunted.\n\n\u201cThe determination of the Taiwanese people to embrace the world has never wavered,\u201d she said, adding that Taiwan must work with \u201clike-minded countries\u201d to ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nTsai said under her watch Taiwan has boosted its combat capabilities with the purchase of advanced weapons and development of home-made aircraft.\n\nTaiwan unveiled its largest defense spending increase in more than a decade in August, aiming to purchase more advanced weapons from overseas.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe island has long been a flashpoint in the U.S.-China relationship.\n\nIn July, the United States approved the sale of an $2.2 billion worth of weapons to Taiwan, angering Beijing.\n\nThe United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help provide it with the means to defend itself.", "description": "Taiwan's president rejected on Thursday a \"one country, two systems\" formula that Beijing has suggested could be used to unify the island and the mainland, saying such an arrangement had set Hong Kong \"on the edge of disorder\".", "authors": ["Yimou Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439105018&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9906G", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
