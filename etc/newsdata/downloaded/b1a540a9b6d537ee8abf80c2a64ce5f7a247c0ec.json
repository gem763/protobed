Kumgang Removed", "language": "en", "text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has criticized his \"predecessors\" for depending on South Korea to develop its Mt. Kumgang resort and ordered the destruction of \"all the unpleasant-looking facilities\" built by the South.\n\nThe North's state-run Korean Central News Agency said on Wednesday that during an inspection trip to the scenic resort, Kim said that \"due to the mistaken policy of the predecessors who tried to get benefits without efforts after just offering the tourist area, the mountain was neglected for more than 10 years.\" He instructed officials \"to remove all the unpleasant-looking facilities of the south side with an agreement with the relevant unit of the south side and to build new modern service facilities our own way.\"\n\nSouth Korean tours to the mountain once symbolized rapprochement between the two Koreas. Tour operator Hyundai Asan spent some W1 trillion building a hotel and other facilities at the site and running the tours, which were halted after a South Korean tourist was shot and killed by North Korean soldiers in 2008.\n\nKim was also quoted as saying, \"Mt. Kumkang is our land won at the cost of blood and even a cliff and a tree on it are associated with our sovereignty and dignity,\" adding, \"We will always welcome our compatriots from the south if they want to come to Mt. Kumgang... but what is important is for our people to have the shared view that it is not desirable to let the south undertake the tour of Mt. Kumgang, our famous mountain.\"\n\n", "description": "Kim Jong-un Orders S.Korea's Tour Facilities at Mt.
