The Sonos Move is the brand\u2019s first foray into portable Bluetooth-enabled speakers.\n\nSonos wanted to make sure that the Move wasn\u2019t just a Bluetooth speaker, so it crafted the Move as an extension of the already-existing technology they pack into the speakers on the market already. To achieve that, there\u2019s a handy little switch on the back of the speaker that, when flipped, automatically activates Bluetooth capability so you can just pick it up and move it, without worrying about re-pairing any device.\n\nIt\u2019s weatherproof (and sunscreen-proof and mustard-proof; they tested everything) so getting caught in a surprise rainstorm won\u2019t hurt it. It\u2019s also drop-proof which makes it the perfect party speaker. You can control it with your voice, thanks to Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa built-in when you\u2019re on WiFi. Off WiFi, you\u2019re free to skip songs, pause play, or add to the queue through Bluetooth. But the biggest difference to the Move compared to other Sonos speakers is automatic Trueplay. This technology perfectly balances the sound for wherever you may be, whether that\u2019s out in your open backyard or listening on a terrace. It only takes a couple of seconds and Move will adjust levels to make sure your listening experience is the best it can be, no matter the circumstances, and without any input from you. The Move was meant to, well, move. It\u2019s available for preorder now for $399. | Get it at Sonos >\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
