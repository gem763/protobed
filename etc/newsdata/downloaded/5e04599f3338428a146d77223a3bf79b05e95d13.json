The Frontier League announced the merger Wednesday.\n\nAccording to Wolff, the Champions were left off the list to avoid having an odd number of teams in the new league.\n\n\"With baseball you play every day, so you need an even number of teams. And the Frontier League had nine teams and if they took all six [Can-Am teams] they'd have an odd number in 15,\" Wolff said.\n\nThat's despite the team lining up two prospective ownership groups, as well as a commitment from the City of Ottawa that a new lease for RCGT Stadium was forthcoming, Wolff said.\n\n\"Our lease was not set in stone. So they said, 'Aha, Ottawa doesn't have a lease, we can kick them out,'\" Wolff said.\n\nNormally, an independent league will subsidize \"a road team\" \u2014 teams without a home stadium \u2014 in order to maintain an even number.\n\n\"My read is simply, they didn't want to field a road team and so, let's get rid of Ottawa,\" Wolff said.\n\nChampions owner Miles Wolff believes the newly merged league doesn't want an odd number of teams in 2020. (Supplied)\n\nAgreement-in-principle reached\n\nTwo groups have expressed interest in taking over the franchise.\n\nOne of those was Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group (OSEG) \u2014 owner of the CFL's Redblacks, the USL's Fury and OHL's 67's \u2014 and partner Regan Katz on behalf of the Winnipeg Goldeyes, a successful franchise in the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball.\n\nBut Wolff said an agreement-in-principle has been reached with another group. That group is led by Rob Abboud, portfolio manager with Wealth Strategies, Fred Saghbini, a project management consultant, and Rob Lavoie, the regional operations manager of Play it Again Sports franchises across the city.\n\nThe deal is contingent on a new lease agreement being reached with the City of Ottawa.\n\nBoth groups were aware that the city expects them to clear nearly half a million dollars in debt the Champions owe before they field a team in 2020, the city said. Wolff was on a repayment plan with the city, but missed his Sept. 4 payment.\n\n\"We're trying to minimize our loss and get our money back. It's been part of the negotiations,\" city manager Steve Kanellakos told councillors in September.\n\n\"We feel now that we have two viable, legitimate owners' groups who are interested in the team [and] who have the financial means to be able to deal with that outstanding debt.\"\n\nWolff told CBC News they're still interested in pursuing baseball locally even if it means switching leagues.\n\nChampions manager and former player S\u00e9bastien Boucher told Radio-Canada he's weighing his options for the upcoming season, but isn't hopeful for a return to pro baseball in Ottawa before 2021. Boucher also coaches high school baseball in town and owns Gatineau's Acad\u00e9mie de Baseball Ultime.", "description": "The Ottawa Champions are a baseball team in search of a new owner, a home field and now, it appears, a league to play in.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3751840.1474205901!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/can-am-rockland-boulders-vs-ottawa-champions.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
