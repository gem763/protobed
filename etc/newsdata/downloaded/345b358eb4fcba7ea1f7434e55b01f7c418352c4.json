Dubbed \u201ccheckm8,\u201d the exploit is a bootrom vulnerability that could give hackers deep access to iOS devices on a level that Apple would be unable to block or patch out with a future software update. That would make it one of the biggest developments in the iPhone hacking community in years.\n\nEPIC JAILBREAK: Introducing checkm8 (read \"checkmate\"), a permanent unpatchable bootrom exploit for hundreds of millions of iOS devices.\n\n\n\nMost generations of iPhones and iPads are vulnerable: from iPhone 4S (A5 chip) to iPhone 8 and iPhone X (A11 chip). https://t.co/dQJtXb78sG \u2014 axi0mX (@axi0mX) September 27, 2019\n\nThe exploit is specifically a bootrom exploit, meaning it\u2019s taking advantage of a security vulnerability in the initial code that iOS devices load when they boot up. And since it\u2019s ROM (read-only memory), it can\u2019t be overwritten or patched by Apple through a software update, so it\u2019s here to stay. It\u2019s the first bootrom-level exploit publicly released for an iOS device since the iPhone 4, which was released almost a decade ago.\n\nRelated How an iOS developer built an alternative App Store for the iPhone\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, axi0mX explained that they released the exploit to the public because a \u201cbootrom exploit for older devices makes iOS better for everyone. Jailbreakers and tweak developers will be able to jailbreak their phones on latest version, and they will not need to stay on older iOS versions waiting for a jailbreak. They will be safer.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no actual jailbreak yet\n\nHundreds of millions of iPhone devices are affected by the exploit: any device starting with an iPhone 4S (A5 chip) through the iPhone 8 and iPhone X (A11 chip) is vulnerable, although it appears that Apple patched the flaw in last year\u2019s A12 processors, meaning that iPhone XS / XR and 11 / 11 Pro devices won\u2019t be affected.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt\u2019s still very early days for the checkm8 exploit. There\u2019s no actual jailbreak yet, meaning that you can\u2019t simply download a tool, crack your device, and start downloading apps and modifications to iOS.\n\nCrucially, the vulnerability is also what jailbreakers refer to as a \u201ctethered\u201d exploit for now, meaning that it can only be triggered over USB. It would also have to be enabled each time through a computer, which limits the usefulness for a practical jailbreak right now. It\u2019s possible that the exploit will lead an \u201cuntethered\u201d jailbreak.\n\nThe possibilities are nearly endless \u2014 in theory\n\nThat said, assuming developers are able to use checkm8 as a starting point into iOS (which is a very big \u201cif\u201d right now), the possibilities are nearly endless: permanently jailbroken devices that won\u2019t be reverted back due to Apple software updates or revoked signatures, downgradable iOS devices that could be easily rolled back to previous versions of the software, dual-booting between multiple versions of iOS, and more.\n\nThere are also security concerns. Nefarious actors could use the vulnerability to circumvent Apple\u2019s iCloud account locks, which are used to render stolen or lost devices useless, or to install poisoned versions of iOS that steal user information. While Apple can patch the bootrom for its newer devices, the hundreds of millions of iPhones already out there can\u2019t be patched without replacing hardware.\n\nThe iPhone jailbreaking scene isn\u2019t nearly as big of a place as it once was, however. Back in the early days of the iPhone, cracking Apple\u2019s devices to install custom software was far more appealing. Back then, there was no way to install third-party apps, and basic features \u2014 like customizable wallpapers for the home screen, simple multitasking, or the ability to copy and paste text \u2014 were missing, leaving jailbreaking as the only way to get those features. As time went on, iOS got more feature complete, giving most users less of a reason to jailbreak, and Apple got better at quashing the security holes that would allow developers to jailbreak phones.\n\nThe value of iOS exploits has also risen greatly, with Apple\u2019s bug bounty program paying for exploits and shadier groups looking to use them to hack iOS devices. That means there\u2019s less incentive for developers who do find jailbreakable exploits to release them. (A recent \u201cflood\u201d of exploits has pushed the price down on iOS exploits to a mere $2 million, compared to $2.5 million on Android.)\n\ncheckm8 might be the spark the jailbreaking community needed\n\nThere\u2019s still an active community of users who insist on having total control over their phones and tablets, but a combination of less demand for the benefits of jailbreaking and lack of major exploits (especially for newer devices / versions of iOS) has led to some stagnation in the community. Plus, there are now new alternatives like AltStore, a recently launched workaround for installing unsanctioned apps on iOS devices without the hassle of jailbreaking at all.\n\nThe new exploit isn\u2019t the only recent development in the jailbreaking space. Over the summer, Apple accidentally unpatched a vulnerability in iOS, opening up modern devices for jailbreaks for the first time in years. And while the hole was quickly patched, it sparked a surge in jailbreaking iPhones.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to say whether the checkm8 will lead to a new golden age for hackable iPhones, although many members of the jailbreak subreddit are extremely optimistic. One user proclaimed that is is \u201cliterally the biggest thing to ever happen in Jailbreaking\u201d due to the scope of the exploit. Either way, given the nature of the exploit and the extent of the devices it impacts, it\u2019ll be something to monitor going forward.", "description": "A newly announced iOS exploit could lead to a permanent, unblockable jailbreak on hundreds of millions of iPhones, according to researcher axi0mX who discovered it.
