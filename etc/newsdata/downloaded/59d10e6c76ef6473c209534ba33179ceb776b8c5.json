So what is she going to do with them?\u201d she teased.\n\n'FAMILY AFFAIR' STAR TALKS 'SURVIVING CISSY,' SEEING ANISSA JONES FOR THE LAST TIME AND ALLEGED SITCOM CURSE\n\nAnd the show will try to put a fresh spin on some of the most familiar names from the beloved sitcom. \u201cIt gives a wink and a nod to the original 'Family Affair' but it's a stand-alone sitcom. Very funny with French who is the antithesis of the original Mr. French,\u201d Garver says, referring to the bearded and burly family helper who was originally played by Sebastian Cabot. \u201cHis name is Carlo and he very handsome,\u201d she adds, with an innocent giggle.\n\nIn this rendition, Garver says she is the female version of Uncle Bill (Brian Keith), aka Aunt Cissy and instead of the kids being 6, they're 16 and 17.\n\n\u201cAnd French is Spanish Latino and very hot!\u201d she gushes. \u201cHe\u2019s my live-in and I'm an actress and I live in Los Angeles. So we filmed it all here and I've got two best friends that are crazy and a couple kind of crazy next-door neighbors.

Nobody was yelling or saying expletives at each other. And so there was kind of a calmness and Brian Keith was very calm and Mr. French, Sebastian Cabot, who was so English kept this all very proper in what we were doing,\u201d she says.\n\n'BEWITCHED' STAR TELLS ALL\n\nThe actress says she was one of the lucky ones to come out of her childhood acting experience with a smile on her face. \u201cI think that you either have that the highs like Ron Howard and Brooke Shields or the lows of people who unfortunately have committed suicide or gotten into drugs,\u201d she says, noting that while she has a glass of chardonnay every night, she has never touched narcotics.\n\n\u201cAlso the ones that were able to survive and do well, their parents took care of their money. So when they were 18 they had money or when they quit the series and were in a very difficult tween-er position, they had money and a family to support them,\u201d she adds.\n\nGarver says her parents were very supportive, and her mother saved every penny she made for her. \u201cI went to college and I graduated from college and it was just kind of a given that they would, of course, save my money for me,\u201d she says while attending the Hollywood Museum Celebrates the 55th Anniversary of \"Gilligan's Island\" event.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe \"Family Affair\" star notes, however, that coming up as a child actor in today\u2019s times seems a lot harder than she had it due to \u201call the psychological problems, which are worse today because on social media they say things like, \"That was really horrible sweater that you wore on that show,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nThe actress says that she\u2019s found herself on social media and has definitely seen trolls in action. But she doesn\u2019t let their comments bother her. \u201cIf anybody says anything horribly political or insulting, they're just, 'Adios.'
