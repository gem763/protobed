Nike debuted the KD12 YouTube sneakers last week ahead of their October 26 release date, when they'll be on sale for $150.\n\nThe shoes \"represent [Durant's] enthusiasm for how the platform connects his on the court life with his fans,\" Nike says on the shoes' launch page.\n\nDurant has 777,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel, which he started in 2017 during his first championship run with the Golden State Warriors. Durant, who signed with the Brooklyn Nets in the offseason, has shared behind-the-scenes clips on his YouTube channel from his life both on and off the court.\n\nThe shoes are, predictably, mostly red, as is YouTube's defining color. The sneakers feature the notable YouTube Play button alongside Durant's name, and even have a search bar on the shoe's insole.\n\nCheck out some of the other details of the sneaker design, which borrows iconic symbols and labels from YouTube.", "description": "Nike debuted the KD12 YouTube sneakers last week ahead of their October 26 release date, when they'll be on sale for $150.", "authors": ["Paige Leskin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5daf166e4af90905a556f7c5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
