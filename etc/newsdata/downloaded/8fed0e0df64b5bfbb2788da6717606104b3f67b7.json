Such are the raised temperatures in Brexit Britain, \u201cit is inevitable that I\u2019m going to come under a certain amount of \u2018shot and shell,\u2019\u201d he told the BBC on Tuesday.\n\nIndeed, in the last few weeks he has lost every vote he has faced in parliament, been bound by law to delay Brexit if he fails to secure a deal with the EU, had his suspension of parliament deemed unlawful by the U.K. Supreme Court, and faced allegations (denied) of past sexual misdemeanors and misuse of funds in public office.\n\nAnd yet the mood at the conference among the Conservative faithful was buoyant, confident \u2014 charging ahead in spite of fierce political battles that await.\n\nWhile EU leaders have indicated they would wait to see the full details, Johnson\u2019s stance on customs appears to breach Brussels\u2019 and Dublin\u2019s red lines.\n\nAfter the setbacks of the past few weeks, Johnson himself, senior aides said, has taken political nourishment from the ardent faith of party members in Manchester. His keynote speech to the conference on Wednesday was directed at them; more a greatest hits album than a new LP, with not a single new policy, but plenty of jokes at the opposition\u2019s expense, and variations on the conference slogan: \u201cGet Brexit done.\u201d\n\nNow for the small matter of actually doing it.\n\nFinal offer\n\nAfter Tory MPs return to Westminster on Wednesday, the real drama will begin to unfold very quickly.\n\nThe EU appears poised to reject Johnson\u2019s \u201cfinal offer\u201d Brexit proposals \u2014 unveiled on Wednesday afternoon \u2014 which seek to replace the Northern Ireland backstop. In its place would be alternative arrangements that include customs checks on the island of Ireland; an acknowledgement that some kind of economic border will have to exist between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if the U.K. is to have its cherished wish of an independent customs and tariff policy.\n\nWhile EU leaders have indicated they would wait to see the full details, Johnson\u2019s stance on customs appears to breach Brussels\u2019 and Dublin\u2019s red lines. \u201cEssentially, if he\u2019s proposing customs checks on the island of Ireland, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the basis of an agreement,\u201d said Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney on Wednesday morning, according to the Irish Times.\n\nThe process of trying to convince Brussels began Wednesday afternoon with a phone call between Johnson and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. But if an agreement cannot be reached, then no-deal on October 31 becomes the government\u2019s policy.\n\nIn that scenario, Johnson will have to battle to evade the Benn Act \u2014 the law passed by MPs last month demanding an extension instead of no-deal.\n\nAt the conference, even some Cabinet ministers were, privately, very doubtful Johnson can escape the consequences of the law. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting it to take effect,\u201d said one. \u201cThe only way a delay can be avoided with certainty is if the EU refuse to have one.\u201d\n\nJohnson may yet fight the law in the courts, or even resign rather than sign the letter requesting an extension. Some members of the government say they would quit if an extension is forced on them, and would expect the prime minister to do the same, leaving the Conservatives ready and willing to fight an election stripped of power, but with their Brexit credentials intact.\n\nOne way or another, most at the Tory conference still believe that the tumults of the days ahead will end with an election.\n\nThe Cabinet minister demurred from this view: \u201cInstinctively, I don\u2019t think resignation is something he\u2019d want to do,\u201d the minister said. Johnson has, after all, coveted the office of prime minister for much of his life and may not wish to relinquish it just three months in.\n\nKeep the faith\n\nFor the Conservative faithful in Manchester, such matters could be left for another day.\n\nThey have long yearned for Johnson to be their leader. Not only does he reflect their overwhelmingly pro-Brexit views, he also, for many in the grassroots, encapsulates something of what it means to be a Tory: free-speaking, unabashedly pro-market, somewhat disdainful of rules, systems and political correctness.\n\nHis speech on Wednesday ticked many of these boxes, hailing the Tories as the \u201cparty of capitalism,\u201d and envisioning Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn being blasted into space, \u201cwhere he belongs.\u201d But it also sought to reassure those in the party with more statist and socially liberal leanings that Johnson\u2019s is a \u201cone-nation government\u201d \u2014 warmly committed to the publicly funded National Health Service and a U.K. \u201copen, outward-looking, global in mindset and insisting on free trade.\u201d There was even an appreciation for wind turbines, not traditionally a Tory vote-winner.\n\n\u201cBoris has always been a huge draw,\u201d said Andrea Thorpe, Conservative association chair from true-blue Maidstone and the Weald in Kent, Southeast England, who had made the trip to the Northeast for the conference to see Johnson in action. \u201cHe has amounted huge support from the membership, and judging by [the] buoyant mood, he has exceeded all expectations.\u201d\n\nThe impending political dramas lent an air of unreality to the conference. A major announcement that the Conservatives would raise the living wage in the U.K. to \u00a310.50 by 2025 did not make national newspaper front pages; possibly reflecting the fact that noone can say whether the Conservatives will still be in power to deliver it.\n\nWhile the members were happy, uncertainty was the prevailing mood among Tory MPs at the center of the storm. \u201cNone of us know what will happen next,\u201d said one former Cabinet minister grimly. \u201cAll you can do is await events.\u201d\n\nElection hopes and fears\n\nOne way or another, most at the conference still believe that the tumults of the days ahead will end with an election some time before the New Year.\n\nThe key question is: Under which set of circumstances will the poll take place?\n\nDowning Street\u2019s preference, according to one senior aide, is an election with a deal done with the EU and Brexit delivered on October 31. Second to that is an election in a no-deal context, even though Downing Street \u2014 and even some Brexiteer MPs \u2014 now acknowledge that economic disruption may hit the vote. The hope is that the political boost of delivering Brexit on October 31 will see the Tories through with the overwhelming backing of Leave voters.\n\nFrom the \u201cCharge of the Light Brigade\u201d to the England football team, Brits love stories about heroic failure.\n\nThe least-favored scenario is the one that looks increasingly likely: an election during an extension forced by the Benn Act. The October 31 promise would have been broken, and Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party would potentially be well-placed to sweep up Conservative votes.\n\n\u201cOctober 31 is the promise that defines him,\u201d the former Cabinet minister said of Johnson. Failing to deliver it could be a gift to opposition parties.\n\nMatters are expected to come to a head in the week commencing October 21. In the unlikely Johnson strikes a deal with the EU at the European Council summit on October 17 and 18, he will have to steamroll it through parliament in a matter of days. And if there is no deal, this will be the week the government either decides to fight the Benn Act in the courts, or faces a no-confidence vote in parliament, or both.\n\n\u201cOne way or another, it will be an extraordinary week,\u201d the serving Cabinet minister said.\n\nJohnson, in his speech, acknowledged that things have \u201cnot been made easier\u201d by the Benn Act, which he calls \u201cthe Surrender Bill.\u201d\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nBut while some MPs are pessimistic about facing an election having failed to meet the October 31 promise, others believe that if Johnson were to show that he had fought, tooth and nail, to resist it, the Tories could still be triumphant in defeat. \u201cIf he can be seen to have resisted extension all the way, we can beat Farage,\u201d said one senior Brexiteer familiar with thinking in Downing Street.\n\nJohnson has spent the last few days defending his use of martial language (without military metaphors \u201cyou are diminishing political debate,\u201d he argued). But his adoption of the popular misquote of Tennyson\u2019s \u201cdo or die\u201d phrase should perhaps alert his troops to the political barrage that lies ahead. As the poet had it: \u201cTheir\u2019s not to reason why / Theirs but to do and die.\u201d\n\nJohnson will hope it won\u2019t come to that, but it may not matter. From the \u201cCharge of the Light Brigade\u201d to the England football team, Brits love stories about heroic failure.
