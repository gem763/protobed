When asked about it by an in-cage Massachusetts State Athletic Commission official, Hardy replied that \u201cit\u2019s USADA approved\u201d and proceeded to use it. Hardy immediately hit with with criticism, as it wasn\u2019t a good look.\n\nOriginally a unanimous decision win for Hardy, the fight was later overturned and ruled a no contest after use of the inhaler was deemed illegal. Speaking Monday at a gathering in Toronto, former referee turned Bellator analyst John McCarthy placed blame on the commission for not preventing Hardy from using the inhaler when he asked about it.\n\n\u201cIt falls on the commission,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThat inspector is an absolute \u2026 he\u2019s an authority with that athletic commission. He is your person inside. He was assigned, that man or that woman. to do that job. His job was to be with Greg Hardy the whole time. He is a representative of the commission, so when Greg Hardy \u2026 Greg Hardy did nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cGreg Hardy\u2019s got asthma. I got asthma. And so Greg Hardy feels like \u2018Oh, I\u2019m getting tight here, I\u2019m in between the second and third round of the fight, and that\u2019s 5 minutes, and I\u2019m going to have a hard timing breathing in this third round. Can I take my inhaler?\u2019 And he says \u2018Hey, can I take my inhaler?\u2019 And that person, when I train people all the time, referees, all of them, I say, if you don\u2019t know, someone asks you a question and you don\u2019t know the absolute right answer, your job is to say I don\u2019t know. Let me find out for you.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy experienced a similar situation in 2010 during a Strikeforce event in which KJ Noons and Muhammed Lawal both used compressed oxygen in their respective bouts, which was approved by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that everyone saw it, because now everyone knows, but I had it in the past and \u2026 Texas allowed an oxygen bottle when I told (the fighters) \u2018No, you can\u2019t do that.\u2019 They went to the commission, commission said yes, and then they had it in the fight. You guys are idiots and sure enough, the media ate the (Texas commission) apart for what they did.\u201d\n\nWhile McCarthy agrees that Hardy shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to use the inhaler as it could have given him an advantage going into the third round, he believes the commission did Hardy wrong and cost him a lot of money.\n\n\u201cNow, you can\u2019t have that done because it is an advantage,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have one fighter getting an advantage when the other fighter is not. You get to breathe the same air inside of that arena, and you can\u2019t alter that air in any fashion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel bad for Greg,\u201d McCarthy added. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy getting ripped for this when he didn\u2019t do anything. He didn\u2019t try to cheat. He tried to get something. I don\u2019t blame him for trying to get it.\u201d", "description": "\"Greg Hardy did nothing wrong\" by asking to use and then using his inhaler in between rounds at UFC Boston, according to \"Big John.\"", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Dan Tom", "Simon Head", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/greg-hardy-inhaler-video-ufc-boston.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
