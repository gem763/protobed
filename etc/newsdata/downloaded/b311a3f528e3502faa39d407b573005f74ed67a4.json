Their previous television campaign that was echoed in a series of posters, aimed at millennials, was widely criticised\n\nSix posters, echoing Lord Kitchener's famous 'Your Country Needs You' slogan, depicted serving soldiers as 'snowflakes', 'phone zombies', 'binge gamers' and 'selfie addicts'\n\nAn Army source said: 'They left it very late finding white female soldiers for the adverts. They had to scour the Army and twist arms because not enough women came forward.\n\n'Perhaps some people were put off by a feeling that the diversity agenda has become almost an obsession.\n\n'Last year's TV ads included a British-Asian soldier praying on the battlefield, and was widely mocked for being completely unrealistic.\n\n'They want to engineer these adverts to present a certain perspective of the Army in terms of its make-up which just isn't the case. They're trying too hard.'\n\nThe SOS, which appeared on the Army's intranet system, read: 'Please advertise this throughout your chain of command as a matter of urgency \u2013 Army National Recruiting Campaign Casting for TV and Online Adverts.\n\n'There has unfortunately been a limited response to this call for volunteers and the roles for the TV adverts have not all been filled. In particular, please target white, female soldiers as this demographic is currently under-represented\u2026\n\n'Filming will be in the UK and Morocco. Interested personnel are to obtain permission from their chain of command.'\n\nThe adverts are set to be screened from January.\n\nThe Army's most recent TV campaign, which was aimed at millennials, was widely criticised.\n\nSix posters, echoing Lord Kitchener's famous 'Your Country Needs You' slogan, depicted serving soldiers as 'snowflakes', 'phone zombies', 'binge gamers' and 'selfie addicts'.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday revealed how one Scots guardsman resigned in disgust when his picture was used below the word 'snowflake'.\n\nLast night an Army spokesman said: 'We routinely work with contracted agencies to fulfil their casting requirements with serving personnel.'", "description": "Filming of the \u00a31million 2020 Army Belonging campaign will begin in Morocco tomorrow.
