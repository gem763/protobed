A Max operated by Ethio\u00adpian Airlines crashed in similar circumstances five months later, killing 157 people. The Max has been grounded worldwide since shortly after the second crash.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing is the first of a pair on Capitol Hill this week, giving members of the Senate and House the chance to publicly question Muilenburg as well as experts who have investigated the crashes and the design of the Max. Democrats in the House are expected to confront Muilenburg with information from some of the hundreds of thousands of pages of evidence they have amassed as they conduct their own investigation into the crashes.\n\nFor Muilenburg, who was recently stripped of his role as chairman of Boeing\u2019s board, the planned testimony is part of a campaign to win back public trust and to satisfy regulators \u2014 even as experts say the company is following its typical playbook after a crash, earning it a reputation for withholding information and pointing to others as blameworthy .\n\nMuilenburg\u2019s prepared remarks cast the company as apologetic for the crashes and humbled by the scrutiny they prompted, but capable of learning from them and of taking its own steps to improve safety.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn the months since the accidents, there has been much criticism of Boeing and its culture,\u201d Muilenburg said in his prepared remarks. \u201cWe understand and deserve this scrutiny. But I also know the people of Boeing, the passion we have for our mission, and what we stand for.\u201d\n\nThe official Indonesian investigation into the crash, released Friday, said a combination of nine factors was responsible, including the design of an automated feature, an improperly repaired sensor, maintenance lapses and pilots who struggled as problems mounted in the cockpit.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration is reviewing fixes to the Max designed to make it safe. Boeing needs the agency\u2019s approval if the Max is to fly again.\n\nAD\n\nMuilenburg said in the prepared testimony that the fixes are the product of 100,000 hours of work and have been subjected to 814 test flights. He plans to reiterate organizational changes the company has made internally to improve safety.\n\nAD\n\nBut Muilenburg\u2019s prepared remarks do not touch on a key topic: the company\u2019s relationship with the FAA, which has come under scrutiny since the crashes.\n\nThe FAA has handed much of the responsibility for guaranteeing that planes are safe over to Boeing and other manufacturers, a system that investigators have found led to spotty oversight and allowed the automated feature on the Max to escape close scrutiny.\n\nRep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), the chairman of the committee Muilenburg is scheduled to appear before on Wednesday, told reporters Monday that there needs to be a change in aviation safety law.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI would say Boeing\u2019s in no position to defend and/or advocate against changes in this law,\u201d DeFazio said.\n\nAnd in the months since the crash, the FAA has pushed ahead with plans to become more industry-friendly, officials say.\n\nAD\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who chairs a Senate aviation subcommittee, said last week that he was concerned about the close relationships between the FAA and the businesses it oversees, saying the agency was subject to \u201cindustry capture.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are enormous incentives to get very cozy with a couple of big companies,\u201d he said at an event hosted by the Hill newspaper. \u201cI\u2019m all for efficiencies, but the safety of the flying public is paramount.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn reviewing the Max ahead of approving it for flight, the FAA has been scrutinizing Boeing\u2019s work. Muilenburg said in his prepared remarks that the company and the agency have been working closely together on the fixes to the jet.\n\n\u201cAll of their questions are being answered,\u201d Muilenburg plans to testify.\n\nThe faulty feature, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, was designed to automatically push the plane\u2019s nose down if it was at risk of stalling. In the crashes, it took in erroneous data from a sensor and turned on repeatedly, confusing and overwhelming the pilots.\n\nAD\n\nBoeing says the new version will not rely on a single sensor and will not activate repeatedly.\n\nAD\n\nMuilenburg said he has flown on two demonstration flights and \u201ccould not be more confident in our solutions.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Muilenburg is likely to face sharp questions this week over how the flawed Max design was ever put into production.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board found that Boeing underestimated the risk posed by the automated feature and overestimated the ability of pilots to bring it under control when there was a problem. The board also concluded that the crews were overwhelmed by alerts when things started to go wrong, and issued recommendations that included urging Boeing to rethink some of its design assumptions.\n\nNTSB Chairman Robert L. Sumwalt is scheduled to testify before the Senate committee after Muilenburg, as is former board chairman Christopher A. Hart, who led an international review of the Max\u2019s design and approval by the FAA.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast week, Sen. Maria Cantwell (Wash.), the committee\u2019s top Democrat, introduced legislation that would give the NTSB\u2019s recommendations the force of law. Cantwell said the move would keep the United States at the \u201ccutting edge of innovation to keep travelers safe.\u201d", "description": "Remarks emphasize internal steps the company is taking to improve safety and to get jets flying again.", "authors": ["Ian Duncan", "Member Of The Transportation Team Focused On The U.S. Department Of Transportation"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7lTI39BrqG1nXtQ8bRl2yGSobHo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SRXZU7XZW4I6TLEMR3HNFHFG54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
