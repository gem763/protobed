It is designed to automatically lower the aircraft's nose if it detects a stall or loss of airspeed.\n\nBefore it crashed, the pilots of the Lion Air 737 MAX struggled to control it as the MCAS repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down, according to its flight data recorder.\n\nBoth the Lion Air and Ethiopian planes \u2013 MAX 8 models \u2013 reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs and descents, as well as fluctuating airspeeds, before crashing shortly after takeoff.\n\nEthiopia has said there were \"clear similarities\" in the two crashes.\n\nBoeing last week gathered hundreds of pilots and reporters for a presentation on proposed MCAS changes \u2013 including the system no longer repeatedly making corrections when pilots try to regain control.\n\nThe company is anxious to win approval for a remedy that could get the planes back in the air.\n\nBut the US Federation Aviation Administration (FAA), which faced harsh questioning last week at a congressional hearing regarding its oversight of Boeing, said it expected the plane maker to submit the proposed fix \"over the coming weeks\" after it undertakes additional work.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "The pilots of the Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX plane that crashed last month initially took the emergency steps outlined by the manufacturer but still could not regain control, The Wall Street Journal reported.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6659/ec9663b8daa7464487c17aeec35661fd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-03"}
