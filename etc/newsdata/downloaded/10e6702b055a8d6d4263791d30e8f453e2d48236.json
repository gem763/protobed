She held a previously unreported town hall at Fidelity Investments\u2019 Boston offices last year, answering questions from around 300 employees about financial regulation and other matters, according to a person briefed on the gathering.\n\nWhile Warren is far from a reliable vote for corporate America\u2019s priorities, she\u2019s refrained from being as antagonistic as she could be, according to lobbyists who\u2019ve worked with her office.\n\nLobbyists for one Massachusetts-based company met with Warren\u2019s staff in 2015 when they feared she might put a hold on a bill the company wanted to pass, according to one of the lobbyists, who described the meeting on condition of anonymity. Warren voted against the bill but didn\u2019t put a hold on it, allowing it to pass.\n\nWarren\u2019s office dismissed the notion that she\u2019s even a little bit accommodating toward K Street.\n\n\"As the senior senator from Massachusetts, Senator Warren and her staff are respectful to plenty of people she disagrees with, but there is no one fighting harder to break the stranglehold of big money on Washington than Senator Warren,\u201d a spokeswoman for Warren\u2019s Senate office said in a statement, citing legislation Warren has proposed to \u201cend lobbying as we know it.\u201d\n\nLike many of the other leading Democratic candidates, Warren doesn\u2019t have much of a network on K Street. Remy Brim, a former health care aide in Warren\u2019s Senate office who\u2019s now a lobbyist at BGR Group, is perhaps the only Warren alum who\u2019s downtown.\n\nNot every lobbyist who\u2019s interacted with Warren\u2019s Senate office has been impressed. One Democratic lobbyist who\u2019s a former Senate staffer said he\u2019d been shut out of Warren\u2019s office and that he didn\u2019t welcome the prospect of Warren in the White House.\n\n\u201cIt was hard to get in see the Obama people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be 10 times harder to deal with her.\u201d\n\nWarren has proposed a blizzard of plans designed to make life harder for K Street if she\u2019s elected, which are popular with voters.\n\nNearly 50 percent of registered voters back her plan to tax companies that spend more than $500,000 a year on lobbying, while only 23 percent oppose it, according to a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll conducted earlier this month.\n\nHer proposed bans on lobbyists representing foreign governments and writing checks to candidates or hosting fundraisers for them are also popular.\n\nJoe Biden also proposed banning foreign governments from lobbying as part of a set of proposals to rein in lobbyists\u2019 influence. His plan also mandates much more extensive disclosure of lobbyists\u2019 interactions with lawmakers and administration officials.\n\nWarren\u2019s plans would be a blow to K Street if Congress somehow passed them into law. Lobbyists registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act have been paid more than $1.2 billion since 2017, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That number doesn\u2019t include lobbying of foreign companies such as Honda or Deutsche Bank, whose lobbyists aren\u2019t considered foreign agents.\n\nThe First Amendment guarantees the right \u201cto petition the Government for a redress of grievances,\u201d and it's unclear whether the Supreme Court would uphold Warren\u2019s proposals if they were passed into law.\n\nNicholas Stephanopoulos, a University of Chicago law professor, wrote in a letter to Warren on Tuesday that there were \u201cstrong arguments\u201d that her proposal to ban lobbyists from making campaign contributions is constitutional.\n\nAnd Joseph Fishkin, a University of Texas law professor, told POLITICO that while there\u2019s limited case law addressing how aggressively the government can limit lobbying, most of Warren\u2019s proposals were likely to be considered constitutional.\n\nBut Martin Redish, a Northwestern University law professor who studies constitutional law, said that while Warren\u2019s plan to ban foreign governments, political parties and companies from hiring lobbyists is likely constitutional, several of her other proposals might not be. Warren\u2019s proposed lobbying tax, in particular, is \u201cso unambiguously unconstitutional that a court would throw it out in a matter of minutes,\u201d he said.\n\n(Redish described himself as a lifelong liberal Democrat who\u2019s \u201cmuch more likely to vote for Elizabeth Warren than I ever would be for Donald Trump.\u201d)\n\nWarren, like most of her rivals for the Democratic nomination, won\u2019t accept campaign contributions from lobbyists. She\u2019s also ruled out taking money from PACs and executives of hedge funds, private equity firms, big banks, big tech companies and the pharmaceutical and fossil fuel industries \u2014 restrictions that she didn\u2019t place on either of her Senate campaigns.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Influence Intelligence and analysis on lobbying \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Ed Rendell, a supporter Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, noted in an op-ed last month in which he called Warren a \u201chypocrite.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of cynically attacking a handful of old donations dwarfed by millions of grassroots contributions in order to deflect from their own practices, every candidate for President should step up, reject federal lobbyist contributions, and support Elizabeth\u2019s comprehensive anti-corruption platform, which would end it permanently,\u201d Saloni Sharma, a Warren campaign spokeswoman, said in a statement to POLITICO.\n\nSeveral lobbyists said they weren\u2019t especially worried about Warren\u2019s proposals because she\u2019s unlikely to get them through Congress even if she becomes president.\n\nOne lobbyist for a Massachusetts-based company who\u2019s interacted with Warren\u2019s Senate office said he didn\u2019t think she was as antagonistic toward K Street as she seemed on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s as hostile toward lobbyists as anyone who\u2019s running for president needs to be these days,\u201d he said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Brian Faler", "-", "A Spokeswoman For Elizabeth Warren S Senate Office."], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/2c/a0/1be2f1b54150872b8cebc79828f0/191019-elizabeth-warren-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
