However, 36 per cent will form an opinion of a home inside and out, according to the survey of 3000 adults. So if you want to impress, it's worth cleaning the windows.\n\nA fifth will clean the windows, with seven in 10 believing good quality, clean windows are important to the overall aesthetic of a home.\n\nBut don't fear too much if you get caught on a messy day, the study carried out through OnePoll, also found three quarters have later changed their opinion of someone's home.\n\nTOP 10 JUDGMENTS PEOPLE MAKE WHEN VISITING A HOME 1. The smell 2. The temperature 3. Whether or not the house have been vacuumed 4. How comfortable the furniture is 5. If the washing up is done or not 6. Dirty windows 7. The books they own 8. How well kept the furniture is 9. Colour of the walls 10. If the ornaments are dusty\n\nOnly one in 10 Brits will even keep areas of the home completely off limits until their guests have arrived.\n\nIt also emerged six in 10 adults consider themselves to be a good judge when it comes to other's homes.\n\nKEEP THE LIVING ROOM CLEAN\n\nOf all the areas in a house, it's the living room, which most judgement is reserved for.\n\nA spokesman for the Independent Network said: 'Our homes are of course very personal to us and in many ways are a representation of our style.\n\n'So there is a sense when we have visitors over that we are leaving ourselves open to criticism and judgement.\n\n'But people shouldn't be apprehensive about what others may or may not think - ultimately it's the opinion of the homeowners themselves which is most important.'\n\nLIGHT A CANDLE\n\nA quarter will buy new candles or air fresheners especially for their guest, 23 per cent will purchase flowers and three in 10 will splash out on fancy food and drink.\n\nThe study also found six in 10 consider themselves to be house proud, with half worrying what others think of their dwellings.\n\nBut this hasn't stopped a fifth from checking for dust upon visiting the home of a friend, family member or colleague.\n\nThe average Brit takes just 38 seconds to judge someone's home - and they will notice if you have vacuumed, if your windows are dirty and if there is a 'funny' smell (stock image)\n\nGET THE VACUUM OUT\n\nFifty per cent of people will give the home a quick vacuum before a guest arrives. After the smell and temperature, this is the first thing guests notice.\n\nWhile a fifth have also 'helped out' by adjusting any wonky pictures or reorganising ornaments.\n\nAs a result, those polled feel the pressure when having guests over with 86 per cent giving the house a 'major' clean before anyone arrives.\n\nAnd if the visit is arranged at short notice, 50 per cent will give their home a quick vacuum, while 48 per cent will quickly hide any clutter in cupboards.\n\nSix in 10 also revealed they are likely to make an extra special effort if their guest is a first-time visitor.\n\nA spokesman for the Independent Network added: 'Inevitably we do form opinions when we are welcomed into other people's homes \u2013 people are naturally inquisitive.\n\n'But as the research shows, our opinions of a home change freely, so it's never too late to impress visitors with our dwellings.\n\n'However our priority should be what we think of our own homes rather than what others think \u2013 although getting inspiration from any homes you visit is no bad thing.'", "description": "According to a report from uPVC systems installer, the Independent Network powered by VEKA, visitors take just 38 seconds to judge someone's home, and smell is the first factor they notice.", "authors": ["Bridie Pearson-Jones For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/16/20091210-0-image-a-43_1571845804957.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
