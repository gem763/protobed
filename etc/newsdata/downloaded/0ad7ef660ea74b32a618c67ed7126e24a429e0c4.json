The slogan echoed that of the so-called Arab Spring uprisings of 2011.\n\nOther protesters chanted \u201cpeaceful\u201d and tried to stop the young men who clashed with security forces.\n\n\u201cThey should leave power because of their failure in running the country,\u201d a protester told a local TV station. \u201cThey have turned us into poor people.\u201d\n\nAnother protester, a woman, said she has a master\u2019s degree and has been jobless for three years, a hint that only people linked to politicians get state jobs and many private companies are laying off staffers because of the crisis.\n\nLater in the day, dozens of protesters closed major roads in the capital with burning tires and barriers causing traffic jams. Some of them began dispersing in the afternoon although others remained closing major intersections amid wide army and police deployment.\n\nDespite tens of billions of dollars spent since the 15-year civil war ended in 1990, Lebanon still has crumbling infrastructure including daily hourslong electricity cuts, trash piles in the streets and often sporadic, limited water supplies from the state-owned water company.\n\nLast week, the local currency reached 1,650 Lebanese pounds to the dollar at exchange shops after it had been stable at 1,500 since 1997. Although the official price is still pegged at 1,500 pounds to the dollar, people find it difficult to get hard currency at this rate from local banks.\n\nThe protest was called for by activists from the civil society as well as individuals.\n\nLast week, amid fears that there will be an open-ended strike at gas stations, people waited in long lines to get vehicles filled.\n\nBecause of the shortage in hard currency, there have been complaints by importers of fuel, medicine and wheat, that they buy the products from abroad paying in U.S. dollars and when they sell in Lebanon they do so in the local currency.\n\nLebanon\u2019s central bank is scheduled to issue instructions to regulate ways to fund imports of fuel, medicine and wheat on Tuesday.\n\nThe state-run National News Agency reported that angry protesters briefly closed the road in the eastern town of Masnaa that leads to the Syrian capital of Damascus. The agency also reported road closures in the northeastern regions of Baalbek and Hermel. There were also protests in the northern city of Tripoli and the southern city of Sidon.", "description": "Hundreds of Lebanese protested Sunday in Beirut and other areas over an economic crisis that worsened over the past two weeks.", "authors": ["Breitbart Jerusalem"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Beirut-Burns_-Lebanon\u2019s-Capital-Erupts-over-Worsening-Economic-Crisis-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
