In response, a number of media organizations and social media users called out Dobbs for his comments:\n\nConservatives really let their anti-semitism out when it's George Soros.https://t.co/55hMumkfBo \u2014 Laura Robinson (@noconflictof) September 12, 2019\n\nFox Business host Lou Dobbs not only smeared liberal Jewish financier George Soros with an anti-Semitic trope, claiming Soros\u2019 \u201ctentacles reach out into various non-government organizations and nonprofits,\u201d but he said it to Michelle Malkin...the poor man's Ann Coulter.\n\n\n\nSick. pic.twitter.com/MfUmA8hlMX \u2014 Russell Drew (@RussOnPolitics) September 12, 2019\n\nBack in the 1930s, Nazi propaganda used imagery of a Jewish octopus that spanned the globe and wrapped up political institutions and organizations.\n\n\n\nLou Dobbs, meanwhile, just casually tossed out that same trope tonight.https://t.co/OIPIS0JMdY \u2014 Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) September 12, 2019\n\nSome anti-Semitic tropes here from Lou Dobbs, who says George Soros has his \u201ctentacles\u201d everywhere https://t.co/ng9obPL1yE \u2014 Sam Stein (@samstein) September 12, 2019\n\nLast year, an episode of \u201cLou Dobbs Tonight\u201d was removed from the network\u2019s rotation after a guest made anti-Semitic remarks about Soros and a repeat airing was broadcast on the same day as the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. A Fox Business Network executive condemned the rhetoric the following day, according to The New York Times.\n\nFox News did not immediately respond to Dobbs\u2019 latest comments.", "description": "The Fox Business host warned of the Jewish billionaire's financial \"tentacles\" pervading various organizations.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d79f2683b0000c49fd1471a.png?cache=fhrx9nijli&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
