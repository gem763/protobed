He was 96.\n\nBowers\u2018 agent, David Kuhn, said he died Sunday of natural causes at his home in Los Angeles.\n\nA native of Ottawa, Illinois, Bowers was a Marine who served in the Pacific during World War II and moved to Los Angeles after the war ended. He found work in 1946 at a gas station on Hollywood Boulevard, and later contended his life changed when the actor Walter Pidgeon drove up in a \u201cshiny\u201d Lincoln two-door coupe and asked, \u201cWhat are you doing for the rest of the day?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gas station was the portal that eventually took me into an exclusive world where high-class sex was everything,\u201d Bowers wrote in \u201cFull Service: My Adventures in Hollywood and the Secret Sex Lives of the Stars,\u201d published by Grove in 2012.\n\nBowers switched jobs from gas attendant to bartender and was welcomed, however discreetly, into the Hollywood underground and party scene. He kept planned assignations in his head, not on paper, and managed to avoid both vice squads and the tabloids in a more censorious, pre-TMZ world. In \u201cFull Service,\u201d he told some of the industry\u2019s most shocking stories since Kenneth Anger\u2019s notorious \u201cHollywood Babylon.\u201d\n\nAt a time when Hollywood nicknames included \u201cDuke\u201d (for John Wayne) and \u201cBogie\u201d (for Humphrey Bogart), Bowers was known as \u201cMr. Sex.\u201d He wrote of orgies with Cole Porter, \u201csexual mischief\u201d with Grant and actor Randolph Scott, giving Vivien Leigh \u201corgasm after orgasm\u201d and affairs with J. Edgar Hoover and Spencer Tracy. He also alleged that he found partners for everyone from Hepburn and Grant to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.\n\n\u201cHis idea of good clean fun included drilling a peephole in the gas station\u2019s bathroom,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Janet Maslin wrote in 2012, \u201cexercising his healthy libido so fully that he sometimes needed an ice pack to recuperate, and providing fake college girls to serve as the real college girls cited in Alfred Kinsey\u2019s scientific sex studies.\u201d\n\nBowers was the subject of a 2018 documentary, \u201cScotty and the Secret History of Hollywood,\u201d directed by Matt Tyrnauer.\n\nCritics were skeptical, and Tracy biographer James Curtis dismissed Bowers as \u201cfull of glib stories and revelations, all cheerfully unverifiable.\u201d But he also had numerous defenders, including the writer Gore Vidal, to whom Tyrnauer dedicated his film.\n\n\u201cScotty doesn\u2019t lie,\u201d Vidal wrote in a blurb for the book, \u201cthe stars sometimes do - and he knows everybody.\u201d\n\nBowers would allege that he had adult encounters since age 11, when a Catholic priest in Chicago would pay $1 for favors. He finally settled down in the 1980s, writing that the AIDS epidemic meant that \u201cit was too unsafe a game to play anymore,\u201d and married speech therapist Lois Broad in 1984. Bowers waited decades to tell his story in part because some of his alleged former clients and lovers were still alive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve kept silent all these years because I didn\u2019t want to hurt any of these people,\u201d Bowers told the Times in 2012. \u201cAnd I never saw the fascination. So they liked sex how they liked it.
