And if that\u2019s what you need, you\u2019ll be able to find lots of advice no matter where you turn.\n\nYou Might Also Like: Are We Destined to Repeat the Mistakes Out Parents Made\n\nBut consider this. A parent\u2019s experience of \u201cnot enough time\u201d is not only about time management. It\u2019s also about the way you think and feel about time.\n\nHere are some questions that may help you reflect on the emotional and psychological factors that affect your experience of \u201cnot enough time\u201d as a working parent.\n\nIs excess stress affecting your experience of time?\n\nSure, time management can be stressful for working parents.\n\nBut when we\u2019re operating under the influence of chronic excess stress, any challenging experience can seem more difficult and negative. If you can learn how to understand, address and recover from excess stress, you may feel less stressed by time, even if your time demands don\u2019t change very much.\n\nAre you creating stress for yourself by how you think about time and how you manage it?\n\nThink about your relationship with time, and consider the following:\n\nAre your goals and expectations for time management unrealistic? Are you trying to do too much? If so, think about what is absolutely necessary and what would just be a bonus, and start with the essentials first. If everything feels essential, have an honest conversation with yourself and ask if that's absolutely certain.\n\nAre you creating distress comparing yourself to other people who appear to be better time managers? It's easy to fall into this way of thinking, but pulling back on this competitive impulse will allow you to adequately assess what you have the bandwidth for. Because no two people are alike, and \u2014 yes \u2014 you will always be able to find someone who is doing more, or manages their time better.\n\nAre you a perfectionist about time? If you create a list of ten things to accomplish on a weekend, and get nine of them done, that\u2019s pretty good. But if you\u2019re a perfectionist you might still feel it\u2019s not good enough! Allow yourself to be a 7 out of 10, or a 9.\n\nIs your experience of time affected by differing cultural norms and expectations?\n\nVarious cultures have different expectations around time. This can happen between different ethnic cultures, but also different workplaces and different families. If your time issues are affected by cultural expectations, is there any way you can address that?\n\nCan you compartmentalize your challenges around time?\n\nTake a look your biggest challenges around time. Which parts can you control and which ones are beyond your control? Try to devote your energy to influencing the areas you have control over. Because it's an uphill battle trying to control situations that can't be controlled.\n\nAre you fully aware of how you spend your time?\n\nIn the end, how we spend our time is a reflection of what we value. Most of us have an internal compass or awareness about which tasks and activities are most important. But sometimes we get so caught up in just getting through the day that we forget to listen to that internal compass. Try keeping a time diary for a couple of days. That might show you that you are spending a lot of time on tasks and activities that, when you stop and reflect, aren\u2019t really that important or valuable to you.\n\nRelevant Reading: How to Create Quality Time With Your Kids When There's So Little Time\n\nPrioritize family time and time for yourself\n\nSometimes we think that doing something fun \u2014 either for ourselves, or with our kids \u2014 is something you do when the \u201cimportant\u201d business of life stuff is done. But enjoyable activities are actually among our most important priorities. It\u2019s not just because our children need our time. It\u2019s good for us as parents! A recent study found that parents reported feeling greater subjective well-being when they were with their children.\n\nEnjoyable activities and good times with our children give us positive energy that helps us be better, happier parents and people.\n\nNow ask yourself: do you have a healthy relationship with time?", "description": "How you think about time is as important as how you manage it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/parents/content/imgs/_8col/time-management.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
