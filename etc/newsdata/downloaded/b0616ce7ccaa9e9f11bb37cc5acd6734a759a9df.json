REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nThe automaker made nearly one in three of Britain\u2019s 1.5 million cars last year at its northern English Sunderland plant, although annual production levels at the site will drop this year.\n\nNissan, which was encouraged by then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s to use Britain as a gateway to the Continent, has spent 100 million pounds on investment in a new Juke model, due to begin production next week.\n\nBut the autos sector, Britain\u2019s biggest exporter of goods, is concerned that World Trade Organisation tariffs of 10% on vehicles alongside new customs checks and delays could halt production if there is a disorderly Brexit on Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cIf we are in a situation in which tomorrow we will have to apply 10% export duties to 70% of our production, the entire business model of Nissan in Europe will be in jeopardy,\u201d the firm\u2019s European Chairman Gianluca de Ficchy told reporters.\n\n\u201cIf there will be a no-deal - and a no-deal will be associated with WTO tariffs application - that won\u2019t be sustainable for us,\u201d he added.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to take Britain out of the European Union without an agreement but is seeking a deal with the bloc, although time is running out to secure an orderly departure before the deadline in three weeks.\n\nMinisters have said they are prepared for a no-deal outcome and could help affected sectors. Brexiteers have long argued that Europe\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, which exports hundreds of thousands of cars to Britain each year, would protect that trade.\n\nNissan said it was examining a host of scenarios and wants the tariffs not to be applied if Britain leaves the bloc without an agreement.\n\n\u201cWe are asking not to have tariffs being applied in a no-deal scenario because otherwise the tariffs won\u2019t be sustainable for us,\u201d De Ficchy said.\n\nIn 2016, Nissan said it would build its next-generation Qashqai vehicle at the factory, key to maintaining staff levels of around 6,000 people at the site and an example of how far in advance major decisions are taken.\n\nThe assumption is that investment will go ahead, De Ficchy said on Thursday, but warned that Nissan would need to react if there were a no-deal outcome, although decisions involving plants might take time.\n\n\u201cWe are conscious about the need to react quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time no quick decision may be taken because the complexity around that scenario is really big.\u201d", "description": "No-deal Brexit tariffs of 10% on vehicles would be unsustainable for Nissan in Europe, where it runs Britain's biggest car factory, the Japanese company warned on Thursday.", "authors": ["Costas Pitas", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439297513&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991FU", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
