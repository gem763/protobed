My answer is clearly no,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, he said he was not opposed to the creation of a digital currency, which France could develop \u201cin a European framework.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe right answer is not a private digital currency under the control of one of the largest multinationals on the planet,\u201d he said, referring to Facebook\u2019s more than two billion users.\n\nThe Libra association officially launched Monday in Geneva with 21 founding members, including the telecoms firms Vodafone and Iliad, as well as tech outfits Uber, Spotify and Farfetch, blockchain operations such as Anchorage, Xapo and Coinbase and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "WASHINGTON: Major European players\u00a0are joining forces to block Facebook's proposed digital currency because of the dangers it poses to national sovereignty, French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire announced Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Facebook-Libra-coin-virtual-currency-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
