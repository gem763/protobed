The healthcare sector, which has been the second-worst performer among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors this year, rose 1.30%.\n\nBut shares of Google-parent Alphabet Inc, however, lost 2.33% and weighed on the Nasdaq as its quarterly profit missed estimates due to higher costs.\n\nThird-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies have largely been better than expected, with over 77% of the 236 firms to report so far surpassing profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data. Still, earnings are expected to decline by 1.9% for the quarter.\n\nOther marquee names reporting this week include tech and internet heavyweights Apple Inc and Facebook Inc , as well as oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp.\n\nAll eyes are now on the Fed meeting, where the central bank is widely expected to deliver a quarter percentage point interest rate cut for the third time this year.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.59 points, or 0%, to 27,091.31, the S&P 500 gained 0.19 points, or 0.01%, to 3,039.61 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 38.58 points, or 0.46%, to 8,287.41.\n\nThe S&P earlier in the session reached a high of 3,047.87, its second straight intraday record.\n\nGeneral Motors Co gained 4.95% after its quarterly net profit topped estimates but the carmaker slashed its earnings forecast for 2019 as the 40-day U.S. labor strike by the United Auto Workers union brought virtually all of its North American operations to a standstill.\n\nBeyond Meat Inc tumbled 22.05% as the vegan burger maker said it would need to offer more store discounts amid rising competition.\n\nShares of GrubHub Inc plunged 40.97% after the online food delivery company warned of slowing growth as customers opted to choose from a growing pool of rival providers.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.13-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 91 new highs and 58 new lows.
