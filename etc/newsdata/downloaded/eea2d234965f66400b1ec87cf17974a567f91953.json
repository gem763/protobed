President Trump Donald John TrumpPelosi hits back at Trump over letter: 'Only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy' Trump directed Perry, State Dept. officials to talk to Giuliani on Ukraine: report Murkowski warns against rushing to conclusions on Trump impeachment MORE has ordered U.S. troops in our territory to withdraw, exposing us to an invasion by Turkish troops who aim to destroy us,\" wrote Ilham Ahmed, who is co-chairman of the Syrian Democratic Council, the SDF's political arm.\n\nAhmed warned that SDF troops guarding ISIS prisoners will have to be redirected to hold off the Turkish military, which signaled it would launch an attack in northeastern Syria as the Trump administration withdrew troops from the area.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The American decision not only puts the lives of countless thousands at risk. It also increases the likelihood of a resurgence of the global terror threat we worked so hard together with the US and its allies to defeat,\" Ahmed wrote.\n\n\"Thousands of Islamic State fighters are in our custody. Guarding them takes huge amounts of resources.

This is not a threat, merely a reality \u2014 we cannot both defend against Turkey and maintain security over the Islamic State prisoners. Our people and our homes must come first. It is our obligation.\"\n\nAhmed called on the U.S. and the international community to help facilitate peace.\n\n\"Despite the betrayal we have endured, we still believe in American values and our true friends in U.S. uniform \u2014 those who stood shoulder to shoulder with our fighters and who changed widespread impressions here about the United States,\" she wrote.", "description": "A Syrian Kurdish\u00a0official\u00a0wrote\u00a0a Washington Post op-e", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/syriaturkishbombing_100919getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
