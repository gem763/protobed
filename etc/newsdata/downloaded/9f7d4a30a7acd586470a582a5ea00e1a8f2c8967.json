AAP\n\nMystic Journey was purchased under the advice of trainer Adam Trinder for just $11,000, and has gone on to win 11 of her 16 starts, and a staggering $3.5 million in prize money.\n\nRoser is quick to emphasise this is no overnight success \u2013 he and Trinder have been buying carefully selected, reasonably priced horses for some time.\n\nBut he never imagined a Cox Plate was possible.\n\n\u201cYou see horses that cost a million dollars that can\u2019t win a maiden around provincial Victoria \u2013 you never know what the engine is going to be like,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just an exception. As they\u2019ve said, she\u2019s probably the best horse to come out of Tasmania.\u201d\n\nThe story of Roser\u2019s career is almost as spectacular as that of his horse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe left school aged 14, and it was only after he was married and had family that he returned to night school to get his HSC while working full time.\n\n\u201cYou went for a job and they used to say, where\u2019s your bit of paper?\u201d Roser recalls.\n\nHe scored a place at the Australian National University studying law and eventually became one of Sydney\u2019s top silks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like racing really. You start off a solicitor, and you never know where that goes, you just work hard.\u201d\n\nThe Enfield case, which came towards the end of Roser\u2019s career in the law, was particularly memorable.\n\nIn February 2009, the Einfeld was sentenced to two years jail for perjury. Three year's earlier he was caught speeding, but rather than accept the $77 fine at a court hearing in August 2006, Einfeld said a friend, American college professor Teresa Brennan, had been driving.\n\nOnly problem was Brennan had died three years earlier.\n\nThe case was similar to the Cox Plate \u2013 a high pressure battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of behind-the-scenes pressure about what should happen, but \u2026 you stick by principles and what you think is right and wrong,\u201d Roser says. \u201cYou go by that, not by outside noises and influences.\u201d\n\nDisgraced former Judge Marcus Einfeld arrives at court with his head bowed in 2009. AAP\n\nRoser has brought that same philosophy to racing. He and Trinder have faced criticism at times for not running Mystic Journey in certain races and for not replacing Darmanin with a higher profiled jockey.\n\nBut Roser\u2019s loyalty to his team is unbreakable; he heaps praise on Trider repeatedly.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a genius. He works 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and that\u2019s what you want.\u201d\n\nRoser retired to the Apple Isle after ill health cut short his career in the law. He\u2019d long owned a property in the seaside village of Sulphur Creek, and during his legal career he often used it as a haven where he could work on big cases.\n\nHis love of horses was born on grandfather\u2019s dairy farm when he was a kid. \u201cI spent a lot of time down there riding bareback, minding the cows basically. I followed racing but the ownership came in much later. It\u2019s a costly game actually.\u201d\n\nMystic Journey will take on one of the most even Cox Plate fields in years. While the dominance of champion mare Winx scared away rivals in the past four editions of the race, her retirement has seen horses from Japan, Ireland, France and New Zealand target the race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch was the competition for spots that three-time group one winner Humidor, who twice ran second to Winx in her Cox Plate wins, is only an emergency and unlikely to get a start.\n\nRoser says the Moonee Valley Racing Club\u2019s decision to guarantee hand-picked international horses, places in the Cox Plate field, has cost local gallopers their shot at glory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real dilemma at the moment for racing: How many international horses do we bring over? There\u2019s got to be a level to allow Australian horses to participate, because they create racing for 12 months of the year.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday his horse will carry the hopes of the local industry as the best Australian-bred horse in the race.\n\nRoser says it will be stressful \u2013 but in the best possible way.\n\n\u201cThis is what dreams are made of \u2013 you just can\u2019t describe it really.\u201d", "description": "The incredible life story of retired senior counsel Wayne Roser could get even better after Saturday's Cox Plate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2508%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/93d9190be46700702fa18aa44c5415a68f71d0df", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
