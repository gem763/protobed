(AP) - North Carolina hasn\u2019t had many chances like the one it will have Saturday.\n\nThat\u2019s when reigning national champion Clemson visits Chapel Hill, marking a rare appearance for a top-ranked team in Kenan Stadium. And the heavy-underdog Tar Heels will try to earn their first win against a team carrying the No. 1 national ranking in The Associated Press poll as they dive into the meat of their Atlantic Coast Conference schedule.\n\n\u201cThey are the best team in the country, they\u2019re the best team in the ACC,\u201d UNC coach Mack Brown said. \u201cThey\u2019re dominating the ACC, and all of us are trying to catch them. \u2026 If you\u2019re going to win this league, you\u2019ve got to beat them.\u201d\n\nThe Tar Heels (2-2, 1-0 ACC) haven\u2019t hosted a No. 1-ranked team since losing to Florida State in 1993 and 1999, with the Seminoles going on to win the national championship each time. UNC has never beaten a team ranked higher than fourth and has lost all nine meetings with top-ranked teams in the AP poll.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not every day you get to face the No. 1 team in the country,\u201d UNC linebacker Jeremiah Gemmel said.\n\nAs for Clemson (4-0, 2-0 ACC), Dabo Swinney\u2019s Tigers have won the past four league championships to go with a pair of national championships in the past three seasons. They\u2019ve soundly beaten their first four opponents, running out to fast starts even with star quarterback Trevor Lawrence having thrown more interceptions (five) than he did after taking over the starting job last season (four).\n\nThe \u201cclosest\u201d game was a 24-10 win against a ranked Texas A&M; team, with the Aggies failing to reach the end zone until there were 6 seconds left in a game long decided. And Clemson opened as a 27\u00bd-point favorite against the Tar Heels.\n\n\u201cWe expect to get four quarters of competition,\u201d Tigers safety K\u2019von Wallace said. \u201cWe expect to get four quarters of bloody-nose football. That\u2019s what we like, that\u2019s what we love. We live for those moments.\n\n\u201cWhat player wants a game where we\u2019re just blowing everybody out? We want that competition, we want that competitiveness. If they can\u2019t play at that high level, that\u2019s on them.\u201d\n\nSome other things to know about Saturday\u2019s Clemson-UNC game:\n\nBEEN A WHILE\n\nClemson is making its first trip to Chapel Hill since 2010, a long gap created by the 14-team league\u2019s scheduling rotation when it comes to cross-division matchups. It\u2019s only the fourth time that the two ACC charter members from neighboring states have met in Chapel Hill, the other times coming in 2000 and 2002.\n\nUNC visited Clemson in 2014 and the teams met in the ACC championship game in 2015, with the Tigers carrying the No. 1 ranking in that one, too.\n\nUPS AND DOWNS\n\nUNC started with wins against South Carolina and Miami, but have had their share of mistakes in the past two losses against Wake Forest and Appalachian State.\n\nThey\u2019ve been outscored 41-13 in the second quarter of games, while true freshman Sam Howell threw his first two interceptions in last weekend\u2019s loss to the Mountaineers. But the Tar Heels have been strong in the final quarter, outscoring opponents 45-9 to turn every game into a final-play finish so far.\n\nMAD SCIENTIST\n\nWallace compares Clemson defensive coordinator Brent Venables to a mad scientist holed up in a secret lab concocting ways for his defenders to make more plays than ever.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever seen a mad scientist, they go all out with anything they are trying to learn, anything they are trying to invent or plan or accomplish,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cHe will stay up all night and all day to make sure we understand the game plan.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s working. Clemson is giving up 10.0 points and 246.5 yards per game.\n\nSTREAKS\n\nClemson is going for a 20th consecutive win dating to the start of last season, which would extend a program-record run that is second-longest in ACC history. The Tigers are also trying to win their 14th straight ACC regular-season game since losing at Syracuse in October 2017.\n\nHAPPY TO REST\n\nLawrence didn\u2019t mind taking his helmet off for good with just 4 seconds gone in the second quarter of the Tigers\u2019 52-10 victory against Charlotte last week. He completed 7 of 9 passes with a pair of touchdowns before cheering on the Tigers\u2019 backups.\n\nThe Tigers have been able to keep their top players fresh and play a lot of guys with the lopsided scores, too. And that depth will be another big advantage Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome to see guys who\u2019ve worked hard get an opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cI love seeing my friends and teammates get out there and do well.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Pete Iacobelli in Clemson, South Carolina contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball , http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ap-top-25-college-football-podcast\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "North Carolina hasn't had many chances like the one it will have Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Aaron Beard"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/aptopix_charlotte_clemson_football_94274_c0-140-3349-2092_s1770x1032.jpg?465f33ad56085cd6874adb045853bad620afb263", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
