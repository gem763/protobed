We\u2019re focused on playing baseball.\u201d\n\nThe ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by Spanish-American celebrity chef Jose Andres, a vocal critic of Trump\u2019s controversial immigration policies and Puerto Rico hurricane relief efforts.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 President Donald Trump was booed by baseball fans as he attended a World Series game with his wife Melania in Washington Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/cfde42_president-donald-trump-was-booed-game-world-series-washington-nationals-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
