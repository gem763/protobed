It has helped to save thousands of lives over recent years.\u201d\n\nIt said strongly encrypted platforms are used by pedophile rings, drug traffickers and terrorists and that NSO\u2019s technologies \u201cprovide proportionate, lawful solutions.\u201d\n\nFacebook demands in the suit that NSO Group be denied access to Facebook\u2019s services and systems and seeks unspecified damages.\n\nCathart said leaders of tech firms \u201cshould join U.N. (free speech) Special Rapporteur David Kaye\u2019s call for an immediate moratorium on the sale, transfer and use of dangerous spyware.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is huge. I am really glad to see a tech company put their massive litigation team on the field on behalf of users,\u201d tweeted Alex Stamos, a Stanford University researcher and former Facebook chief security officer.\n\nWhatsApp is the world\u2019s most popular communications software, with about 1.5 billion users in 180 countries.\n\nJohn Scott-Railton, a researcher with the internet watchdog Citizen Lab, called the hack \u201ca very scary vulnerability\u201d when it was discovered. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing a user could have done here, short of not having the app.\u201d\n\nCitizen Lab subsequently volunteered to assist Facebook in the investigation.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that malicious code from NSO was sent from April 29 through May 10 over WhatsApp servers. The aim was to infect some 1,400 devices whose users included attorneys, journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats and other government officials. It said the targeted phone numbers were in countries including Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Mexico.\n\nNSO\u2019s spyware has repeatedly been found deployed to target such people. Most notably, the spyware was implicated in the gruesome killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year and whose body has never been found.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Facebook alleges that after it publicly announced that it had identified and closed the vulnerability an NSO employee complained \u201cYou just closed our biggest remote for celluar \u2026. It\u2019s on the news all over the world.\u201d\n\nThe spyware did not directly affect the end-to-end encryption that makes WhatsApp chats and calls private. It merely used a bug in the WhatsApp software as an infection vehicle.\n\nNSO Group\u2019s flagship malware, called Pegasus, allows spies to effectively take control of a phone - remotely and surreptitiously controlling its cameras and microphones from remote servers and vacuuming up personal and geolocation data.\n\nA European private equity firm, Novalpina Capital LLP, bought a majority stake in NSO Group in February. It claimed in a May statement that \u201chighly targeted interception technologies\u201d of the kind NSO Group produces \u201cplay a critical role in protecting the public\u201d and can do so without undermining privacy rights or free speech.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Facebook sued the Israeli hacker-for-hire company NSO Group on Tuesday in U.S. federal court for allegedly targeting some 1,400 users of its encrypted messaging service WhatsApp with highly sophisticated spyware.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Frank Bajak"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/29/whatsapp_spyware_82312_c0-257-5985-3748_s1200x700.jpg?b5777a50c0580a2933e2097baf1dd69632987908", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
