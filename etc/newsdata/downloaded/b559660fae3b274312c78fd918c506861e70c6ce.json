He obsessively watches a wrestling video presented by a mysterious and hammy wrestling pro called the Salt Water Redneck (Thomas Haden Church), who\u2019s barking at the screen and demonstrating tricky moves such as the atomic throw.\n\nWith the help of mischievous old-timer Carl (Bruce Dern), Zak actually gets away, and finds himself on the run with an angry, unhappy, mixed-up guy who is wanted by the police. This is Tyler: a sympathetic, relaxed performance from Shia LaBeouf.\n\nTyler is the one person who never patronises Zak, and he also takes a shine to Eleanor (Dakota Johnson), the concerned nurse trying to track Zak down. Together, the three of them wind up on an adventure, some of which is on a raft \u2013 on a mission to find the Salt Water Redneck and make Zak\u2019s dreams come true in the ring. Tyler and Eleanor share a confused notion that by helping Zak they can somehow help themselves.\n\nWhy films about learning disabilities need to be more than merely feelgood | Saba Salman Read more\n\nThere\u2019s a nice cameo from Wayne Dehart as \u201cBlind\u201d Jasper John, the backwoodsman who has an unofficial line in baptising passersby in the local creek.\n\nThe Peanut Butter Falcon isn\u2019t shy of pushing your buttons, but the overall effect has an innocent charm and frankness, and LaBeouf brings a winning combination of toughness and soul.", "description": "A child in care finds himself on the run with a criminal, with Dakota Johnson\u2019s nurse on their trail, in an innocently charming adventure story", "authors": ["Peter Bradshaw"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/affebeb02a4dbf1ebd6c3aa6051a5ea83904fe3f/0_60_2870_1723/master/2870.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7e2bf2fe27fe8e093a7b9ba252f018b6", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
