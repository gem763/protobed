Sneaking and cheating are game-play elements that get rewarded; being a bad goose is what it must feel like to be a card sharp, or a pool shark, or a Patriots fan. Though delightful, the game revealed its dark side to me early on. Like anyone else, I quietly endure tiny slights in my everyday life\u2014when someone passes me abruptly in the bike lane or doesn\u2019t hold the elevator\u2014because I\u2019m a socialized adult. But the goose knows no law, and through this avatar I can channel my silent screams into a cri de coeur. Honk! It can\u2019t be healthy to take this much joy in harassing strangers, even if virtually.\n\nA goose turns out to be a perfect vehicle for carrying out various misdeeds and misdemeanors. With its low frame and snaking neck, this bird is anatomically designed for snatching objects and causing mischief (its abilities in the game include honking, grabbing, crouching, and flapping). Players guide their goose through four open-ended, nonlinear stages: a garden, a market, a pub, and a pair of neighboring backyards. Gentle cel-shaded graphics, presented in an axonometric overhead view, are bright and legible, and each destination has its own set of puzzles. Accomplish a task or solve a puzzle, and a menu will show that you\u2019ve crossed that item off that to-do list. (I should note that there\u2019s no obligation to do any of this stuff; screeching at people is its own fun.)\n\nThe goose\u2019s agenda items involve being a nuisance (\u201cget the groundskeeper wet\u201d), sowing chaos (\u201ctrap the boy in the phone booth\u201d), and sure-to-go-viral tasks (\u201crake in the lake\u201d). Each of the locations in the village has its own combination goal, too, which calls for gathering several hard-to-get objects. \u201cDoing the wash,\u201d for example, means stealing a bra, a slipper, a pair of socks, and a bar of soap from the hapless neighbors. Honking at these innocents only makes them more human: They grow visibly irritated by their helplessness in the face of a persistent pest.\n\nStill, after two weeks of playing this game, I\u2019ve come to resent the villagers\u2019 comfortable lives, perhaps as a way to justify my own terrible behavior as the goose. I imagine that the retiree whose teacup I\u2019m conspiring to take is reading a newspaper I wouldn\u2019t like. I curse out loud as I navigate around the bouncer who\u2019s trying to shoo me away from the bistro. Why should this restaurant have a pepper grinder when Goose does not? Their ordered world is offensive; it fills me with rage. I think there could be a way to nudge the neighbors toward romance, but I decline to do so. Goose abhors love.\n\nhouse house\n\nThe hidden genius of Untitled Goose Game comes in the morally corrupting mystery tasks that players unearth. While there\u2019s an explicit list of chores for each of the four stages, there are also secret lists that can be unlocked by committing truly wily crimes. For example, the goose might shut the groundskeeper out of his garden by luring him outside the gate before stealing his keys. Doing so brings up the satisfying graphic of a pencil scratching a puzzle off a hidden list\u2014one whose items are veiled until they\u2019re solved. In other words, the only way to find every reward in this game is to be excessively, creatively cruel.", "description": "Honk!", "authors": ["Kriston Capps"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/goose/facebook.png?1570202358", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
