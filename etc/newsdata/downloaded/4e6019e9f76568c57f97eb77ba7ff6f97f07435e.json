She was reportedly painting a mural in his Pittsburgh home for him at the time.\n\nAfter rejecting his unwanted advances, the artist said Brown ended their professional relationship and ghosted her despite still not having paid for a painting of her\u2019s he won at a charity auction.\n\nBrown denied the account through his lawyer when the story was published, but reportedly responded to his accuser privately by sending her a profane and bizarre group text message.\n\nThe accuser\u2019s lawyer included screencaps of the messages in a letter to the NFL sent Thursday. The messages appear to show Brown ordering an associate to investigate the artist and including a picture of her children pulled from her Instagram account.\n\nStory continues\n\nNew tonight: Antonio Brown sent our source from Monday\u2019s story menacing group text messages, including a picture of her children with instructions for his associates to investigate her.\n\n\n\nHer lawyer wrote the NFL calling for the intimidation to stop. https://t.co/rCTM8WSI6Z pic.twitter.com/QtONzBf7Ig \u2014 Robert Klemko (@RobertKlemko) September 20, 2019\n\nSports Illustrated reportedly verified the texts were sent from the same number Brown used with the artist in 2017. Brown\u2019s lawyer Darren Heitner was reportedly included in the group text, but told the outlet he had not advised Brown to communicate with the woman.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Lisa J. Banks, a lawyer for the artist, reportedly sent the letter to the NFL seeking an end to Brown's conduct that she called \u201cintimidating and threatening to our client, in violation of the NFL Personal Conduct Policy.\u201d\n\nFrom Sports Illustrated:\n\n\u201cOur client ... is understandably frightened by these text messages, which are clearly intended to threaten and intimidate her,\u201d the lawyer wrote. \u201cWhile she certainly qualifies as a \u2018starving artist,\u2019 she has never approached Mr. Brown, nor will she, about seeking money to compensate her for his sexual misconduct, contrary to his allegations in the text messages.\u201d\n\nWhen Sports Illustrated reached out to a phone number supposedly belonging to Brown, the number replied with nine-character answer: \u201cfoh clown.\u201d\n\nEven more accusations have emerged against Antonio Brown.

He still could be facing a suspension from the league over the matter.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "A mural artist told Sports Illustrated that Antonio Brown ghosted her after making an unwanted sexual advance.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BSuC1ejY7euSlByPCojeNA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MjAuNTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DvNdVQGcM6gpwYIv3H..Pw--~B/aD0yNDYwO3c9MzQyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/0cebbcb0-db60-11e9-9bbf-164c58328f0f", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
