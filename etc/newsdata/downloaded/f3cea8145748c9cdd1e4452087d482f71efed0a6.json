He further demanded that its host, actor Salman Khan be booked under the stringent National Security Act.\n\nIn less than three weeks of its telecast, Salman Khan's reality show is making headlines for all the wrong reasons. After the latest demands by Karni Sena and BJP MLA Nand Kishore Gujjar, the issue is now being looked into seriously by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.\n\nANI tweeted, \"Sources: Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is looking into the complaint against 'Big Boss - 13' reality show.

They are voted out every week until only one survives and makes it to the finale to become the winner. During their stay in the house, contestants are continuously monitored by live television cameras as well as personal audio microphones.", "description": "Bigg Boss is one of the most controversial reality shows in India and still, it gets renewed every seasons for the simple logic of supply and demand.
