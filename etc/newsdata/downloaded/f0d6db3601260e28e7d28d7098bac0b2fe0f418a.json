Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nWhy some colleges secretly track potential students online\n\nUniversities are collecting more data about prospective students than ever before \u2014 in part, administrators say, to help better predict which students are most likely to apply, accept an offer and enroll in classes. It\u2019s a trend that could raise a hidden barrier for underprivileged students seeking a college education, says business reporter Douglas MacMillan\n\n\n\n\n\nAdministrators say that the information \u2014 gathered through tracking software from outside consulting companies \u2014 does not affect final admissions decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing things like looking at, \u2018Is this person going to our athletics page,\u2019 because maybe that will show they are interested in a sports scholarship,\u201d MacMillan says. \u201cOr, \u2018Is this person spending a lot of time on the financial aid website,\u2019 because that indicates they are somebody who is going to need more financial aid when they apply to the school.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile colleges have used data for many years to decide which regions and high schools to target with recruiting, the latest tools let them build rich profiles on individual students and quickly determine whether they have enough family income to help schools meet revenue goals. Administrators say that the information gathered does not affect final admissions decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video-game industry is focusing on human impact\n\nLual Mayen does a lot of his coding from a comfy chair at a Washington, D.C., WeWork. The trendy office space is a far cry from where he grew up and first started designing games \u2014 a refugee camp in northern Uganda that housed his family for more than two decades.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow in the United States, Mayen has made it his mission to spread peace and empathy through video games like his computer game, Salaam, which walks players through the refugee experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very real scenario and situation,\u201d says sports reporter Alex Andrejev. \u201cHe personally was hiding from falling bombs, and so were his friends in the refugee camp.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHis game, Andrejev says, is just one of a growing number of social-impact games that the video-game industry is investing in now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs many as 90 percent of teens say they play video games,\u201d Andrejev says. \u201cAnd with that comes the opportunity for more young people to play and start building these empathetic reactions and learn conflict resolution.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nUnemployment, corruption and a lack of social services revive protests in Iraq\n\nThe recent wave of protests to hit Iraq has left more than 100 dead and thousands injured, marking a conclusion to protests calling for the end of a political system that has existed since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaghdad bureau chief Louisa Loveluck says many of the protesters across Baghdad and much of southern Iraq are young, not old enough to remember a time before the invasion and fall of Hussein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey say they feel locked out of a system that\u2019s been built for people with political connections,\u201d Loveluck says. \u201cThey want jobs, they want services, they want a decent health system and they want access to an education that will actually get them somewhere.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Douglas MacMillan explains how colleges track potential students before they even apply.
