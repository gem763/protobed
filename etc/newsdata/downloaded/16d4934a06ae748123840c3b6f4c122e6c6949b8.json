Her velvety black dress and extravagant headdress are studded with pearls. At her throat is an extraordinarily Carrie Bradshaw-esque accessory: a gold-and-pearl initial-B necklace.\n\nThis is Anne Boleyn, or rather the idea of her as created posthumously in the late 16th century. Her look is also very now \u2013 think square necklines, OTT sleeves and embellished headgear. It is all part of a wider trend described as \u201cRenaissancecore\u201d by the style blog Manrepeller.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anne Boleyn \u2026 on a catwalk near you.

On the Strictly Come Dancing results show a fortnight ago, Tess Daly wore a black velvet dress with a very Boleyn-ish square neckline and leg-o\u2019-mutton sleeves. The same week, the Game of Thrones star Gwendoline Christie wore a \u201cRenaissance-inspired\u201d gown on the red carpet. The square necklines are also very Ganni spring/summer 2020.\n\nEmbellished headbands are fast becoming central to the aesthetic of 2019. The Duchess of Cambridge is so attached to hers that British Vogue was moved to run a piece on her life in headbands. The headband\u2019s status as the go-to accessory for women in the public eye was confirmed by its appearance on Carrie Symonds\u2019 head during the Queen\u2019s speech on Monday. Meanwhile, among the very young and hip, they have become winter\u2019s answer to the flower crown, ever larger and more ostentatious.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Then and now \u2026 Gwendoline Christie at the Emmy awards.

Having previously lived in France, Boleyn was a standout fashion leader, credited with popularising Gallic styles such as the \u201cfrench hood\u201d \u2013 described as an adorned \u201chalf moon \u2013 or crescent \u2013 style band or brim sloping away from the face\u201d.\n\nAnne of Cleves was no style slouch either, with some saying she popularised the leg-o\u2019-mutton sleeve. Incidentally \u2013 whether ballooning or draped \u2013 fancy sleeves are very Renaissance, and very Roksanda Ilin\u010di\u0107 and JW Anderson. Then and now, big sleeves are a way of taking up space with clothing, a power move that reverberates through the ages.\n\nWhat should we make of the return of a look in which opulent fashion was employed as a defence \u2013 albeit one that so often proved futile in the face of the (literally) cut-throat establishment? Perhaps nothing too encouraging. But the fact that the English Renaissance has been described as \u201cthe peacock age\u201d by some historians explains its appeal for Christmas-party season in the attention economy.", "description": "Think square necklines, OTT sleeves and embellished headgear \u2013 the 16th-century queen is fashion\u2019s latest muse", "authors": ["Hannah Marriott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db568770d459b71b0c38e386f25c5762e129ddc4/2_0_8885_5333/master/8885.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f1cb045955efcc2569430e2696dd2235", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
