Harry Maguire has personally made a fair start to his Manchester United career but is playing in another failing team.\n\nHarry Maguire has urged his England team-mates to get back to their ruthless best\n\nSo it is not as if any of those three came into the Czech game on Friday night flushed with confidence. It showed \u2014 and Maguire conceded as much.\n\n\u2018Maybe,\u2019 he said when asked directly whether club form had contributed to defensive woes. \u2018We bring our club football into international level. It was a difficult game. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we started sloppy. We took the lead in the game but we didn\u2019t deserve to.\n\n\u2018In the second half we controlled the game a lot more than the first half but we gave them a sloppy goal to win the game. We do need to improve on that. We were not at our best and got punished for it.\u2019\n\nMaguire and his team-mates were outmuscled as England suffered a surprise defeat\n\nSince June, England have conceded three goals against both Holland and Kosovo and now two against the Czech Republic. As concerning in the first half was their inability to defend corners, which was also how they conceded the first goal to Holland in the Nations League semi-final in June.\n\n\u2018The first goal was a set-play and we probably need to tighten up on those,\u2019 said Maguire. \u2018We\u2019ve been really good over the last year or so at defending set-plays.\u2019\n\nPlaying out from the back also cost England twice against Holland, for the opening goal against Kosovo last month and again on Friday when Zdenek Ondrasek scored the winner after Jordan Pickford attempted a chipped pass long to Danny Rose.\n\nMaguire said: \u2018The second goal has come from us being a bit too open when we were trying to build up from the back and maybe it was at a stage of the game when we shouldn\u2019t have looked to do that.\n\nZdenek Ondrasek scored the winner after Jordan Pickford tried a chipped pass to Danny Rose\n\n'We could have consolidated the point and tried to play in their half a bit more. So maybe better game management would have helped us, at worst, draw the game 1-1.\u2019\n\nYet Maguire takes issue with the fact that defensive flaws are an ongoing problem. When asked about a run of games \u2018shipping goals\u2019, he countered: \u2018This \u201crun of shipping goals\u201d, I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s come from apart from the last couple of games.\n\n'We will work hard and try and improve. But shipping lots of goals over the last couple of years \u2014 we haven\u2019t.\u2019", "description": "As a\u00a0recipe for success, bringing together Manchester United, Everton and Tottenham players to form a watertight defence for a tricky away England trip to Prague had obvious flaws.", "authors": ["Rob Draper For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/21/19635918-0-image-a-6_1570912643642.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
