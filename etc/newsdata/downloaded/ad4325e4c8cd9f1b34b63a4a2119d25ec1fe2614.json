But all open-ended funds could face more rules once the Bank of England and FCA complete a separate review.\n\nThat review is assessing how funds\u2019 actual redemption terms - rather than just how existing ones are applied - might be better aligned with the liquidity of their assets in order to minimise financial stability risks, and provide appropriate protection to investors.\n\nPolicymakers are also keen to ensure that funds that invest in illiquid assets like infrastructure are at a competitive disadvantage to funds that invest only in highly liquid assets like shares.", "description": "Britain's markets regulator published tougher rules on Monday for funds that invest in hard-to-sell assets like property, saying investors must get better warnings about the risks they face if they want their money back at short notice.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
