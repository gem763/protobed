Joanne (9-4 MMA, 1-0 BMMA) submitted former UFC competitor and Bare Knuckle FC champion Bec Rawlings with a second-round kneebar. The time of the stoppage was 3:35.\n\nFrom the opening bell, Joanne slowly but surely displayed the disparity between her skill level and Rawlings (7-9 MMA, 0-1 BMMA).\n\nThe fight-ending sequence was a back-and-forth grappling exchange. Rawlings reversed Joanne on the ground, but the Brazilian snatched a leg. From there, she extended and quickly locked in a kneebar, which just as quickly led to the tap as the Pitbull brothers protege earned the victory in her Bellator debut.\n\nFollowing the fight, Joanne, dressed in \u201cGame of Thrones garb,\u201d displayed her list and crossed off Rawlings. Three more names were left: Valerie Loureda, Valerie Letorneau, and Bellator flyweight champion Ilima-Lei Macfarlane.\n\nThe flyweight bout was part of the Bellator 231 main card at Mohegan Sun Arena. The main card aired on Paramount and streamed on DAZN following prelims on MMA Junkie.\n\nUp-to-the-minute Bellator 231 results include:", "description": "Newcomer Ilara Joanne lived up to her nickname \"Arya Stark\" when she crossed Bec Rawlings off her list at Bellator 231.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Dave Doyle", "John Morgan", "Matt Erickson", "Mike Bohn", "Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ilara-joanne-bellator-231.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
