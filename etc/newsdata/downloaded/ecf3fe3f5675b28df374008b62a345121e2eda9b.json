He said JUI-F should rather hold this march on the Line of Control.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Federal Minister for Aviation Ghulam Sarwar Khan says the government will facilitate former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in his medical treatment.", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ghulam-Sarwar-3-750x369.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
