The large number of arrests on Monday, which came in addition to several arrests and equipment seizures over the weekend preceding the start of the official protest as well as arrests at a pre-protest last week, implies the force may be taking a different route this time.\n\nOver one hundred protesters camped out overnight on Horseferry Road, the home to a number of government ministries. Tuesday morning, Police warned those who remained on the road outside the Department for Transport that if they did not move on they would be arrested.", "description": "Boris Johnson's rhetoric took a Trumpian turn as he dismissed the green extremists holding London to ransom as \"uncooperative crusties\".", "authors": ["Oliver Jj Lane"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1174220564-e1570529700188-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
