He said that it could have come from an oil tanker that sank, an accident when loading oil from one tanker to another, or from a criminal act.\n\nThe oil spill is putting Brazil back in the spotlight for environmental disasters. A surge in fires in the Amazon rainforest in August sparked an international backlash against President Jair Bolsonaro, a social conservative who supports developing natural resources in the Amazon. Two massive mining waste dams have collapsed since 2015, claiming hundreds of lives and polluting waterways in several states.\n\nBrazil first started noticing the oil on Sept. 2 and began cleanup efforts and investigations into the cause, including a criminal probe by federal police, according to the Ibama environmental agency.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Peter Millard in Rio de Janeiro at pmillard1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tina Davis at tinadavis@bloomberg.net, Carlos Caminada, Reg Gale\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Brazil\u2019s efforts to uncover the origin of oil washing up on more than 130 beaches along its pristine northeastern coastline are pointing to Venezuela as the likely culprit.Brazilian Environment Minister Ricardo Salles on Wednesday said that a report from Brazil\u2019s state-controlled oil company", "authors": ["Peter Millard"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
