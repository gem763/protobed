It includes $9 billion in investment in U.S. plants, 9,000 new or retained jobs and signing bonuses exceeding the $8,000 workers got four years ago, people familiar with the matter said. Workers will get 3% pay raises in some years of the contract and 4% lump-sum payments in the others.\n\n\u201cThe number one priority of the national negotiation team has been to secure a strong and fair contract that our members deserve,\u201d UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in a statement. He said the union\u2019s bargaining committee recommends that the GM National Council -- comprised of presidents and chairmen from locals around the country -- vote in favor of putting the deal up for a ratification vote.\n\nGM confirmed a tentative agreement had been reached, but neither the company nor the union provided details on what\u2019s included in the deal. GM shares rose as much as 2.6% to $37.22, the highest intraday in two weeks.\n\nThe stakes were rising for both sides as the strike entered a fifth week, costing GM billions, forcing workers to live on $275 a week and denting the economy in Michigan and the Midwest. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimate the strike has cost GM about $2 billion of earnings, and its striking workers may have lost $2,000 of profit sharing and as much as $4,000 in take-home pay.\n\nThe walkout also become a national political issue, coming up during Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Ohio, which has lost thousands of auto industry jobs.\n\nSpeed Up\n\nIf the UAW decides to continue the strike until the deal is ratified, the union may be pressured to expedite the process, said Art Schwartz, a former GM labor negotiator.\n\n\u201cIf they keep them out, I\u2019m sure they will speed ratification up,\u201d said Schwartz, who\u2019s now a consultant in Ann Arbor, Michigan. \u201cUsually, it takes about two weeks, but it doesn\u2019t have to, they can do it quicker and I think they would.\u201d\n\nAfter exchanging blame last week, GM and the union made rapid progress over the weekend. Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss showed up in person at the main bargaining table on Tuesday. And in an early sign a possible deal was in the works, UAW bosses summoned local presidents and chairmen to Detroit for a meeting Thursday.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence says:\n\n\u201cGM will likely shrug off the near-term supply constraints and earnings reduction of a strike-ravaged 3Q. Depending on the conditions, the cost of the next contract over four years carries the greater risk of making the automaker uncompetitive if U.S. demand ebbs.\u201d\n\n-- Kevin Tynan, senior autos analyst\n\nClick here to read the research\n\nGM and union officials reached a key compromise on a path to full-time employment for temporary staffers after three consecutive years of work, people familiar with the situation said. The treatment of temps, some of whom have worked at GM for as long as four years, had been one of the most contentious issues standing the way of a deal.\n\nThe automaker said last week that it was willing to increase wages and lump sum payments, preserve health-care benefits, remove a cap on how much profit sharing is paid out based on earnings and boost ratification bonuses.\n\nRead more: In GM Strike, Old Grievances Retooled for a New Era\n\nThe UAW\u2019s national council will decide Thursday whether to recommend the agreement for a ratification vote and if the strike will continue while members cast ballots.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t feel confident in their ability to get it ratified, they may just say \u2018we\u2019re going keep them out on strike until it\u2019s ratified, because we\u2019re not sure,\u201d said Arthur Wheaton, director of the Worker Institute at Cornell University. \u201cIt will be a great temperature test to see whether or not they feel confident in the vote.\u201d\n\nRatification Challenge\n\nGetting the new four-year agreement approved by the rank-and-file could be a challenge. GM outraged union workers last year by threatening four U.S. plants with possible closure, though it\u2019s offered to keep at least one of those factories open.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- General Motors Co. and the United Auto Workers reached a tentative agreement on a new contract, clearing the way for a union vote Thursday on whether to continue a more than month-long strike.The accord reached Wednesday may bring an end to the union\u2019s longest national walkout against", "authors": ["David Welch", "Keith Naughton"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8GBOWH1OudehcXy5qBkOVg--~B/aD0xMzgyO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/08167103a794d97e9ee8d6dc38724134", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
