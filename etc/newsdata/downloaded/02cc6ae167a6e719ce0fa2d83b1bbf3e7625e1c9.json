Another former senior West Wing aide agreed that the White House seemed to be \u201ca little bit unraveling\u201d in recent days.\n\nSome current White House officials say they are simply exhausted after all the constant fighting, and lack the energy to try to constrain a wilful president bent on having his own way. It\u2019s normal for officials to return to the private sector after a few years of pressure-cooker public service, but the Trump administration has seen extraordinary levels of turnover, and the administration\u2019s current ranks are thin and getting thinner. A current White House official described a \u201cwho cares\u201d attitude creeping through the building under Mulvaney\u2019s hands-off management style.\n\nBut others in the White House relish the daily hand-to-hand combat as House Democrats careen toward what looks like an inevitable impeachment vote.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
