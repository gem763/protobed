What Parents Need to Know", "language": "en", "text": "If you're a parent, there is no doubt you want the best for your kids. To most of us, this means providing our children with the opportunity to not just attend college -- but to attend the college they want and graduate without thousands of dollars in student loan debt.\n\nThis isn't about spoiling your kids. Student loans present a serious burden to the students and graduates who carry them. Plenty of research shows how student debt is damaging a generation by forcing them to push back major life milestones like getting married, having a family or owning a home.\n\nAt the same time, you have your own financial realities to face. It's becoming harder for many to feel like they can maintain a middle-class lifestyle, and ultimately, we all have limited resources to use to fund short-term, mid-term and long-term goals.\n\nWith competing priorities, it's natural for parents to wonder: Should I save for college or save for retirement? To decide, here's what you need to consider.\n\nThe Big Challenge for Families: Rising College Costs\n\nIt doesn't matter who is footing the bill for your kids' college tuition, be it your parents helping out or your kids pitching in to ease costs by getting part-time jobs in school: The fact remains that college costs are rising exponentially.\n\nWhile the median household income in the U.S. is at the same level it was in 1999 when you adjust for inflation, take inflation out of it and the picture looks a little better; incomes have grown by 135% over the last couple decades. But this growth looks almost meaningless when you compare it to the growth of average tuition at public four-year colleges. That cost has grown by a whopping 549%, according to College Board figures reported in a Wall Street Journal story.\n\nMany parents feel that pushing this cost onto their kids, who will surely need to take out student loans to manage it, is unfair. Some parents even think it's unethical or downright wrong. I can understand that perspective ...\n\nUnless it means paying for your children's college education means you're not saving enough for your own retirement.\n\nSave for Retirement! Parents Need to Pay Themselves First\n\nA lot of parents do not like hearing this. They feel like there's nothing more important than their children, and to fund their own retirement first means they're selfish or downright bad parents.\n\nBut the fact is the retirement landscape has changed almost as much as the cost of college has risen. Pensions are gone. Social Security's trust funds are shrinking, which puts benefits payouts in danger. Only about half of employers today even offer something like a 401(k).\n\nYou're on the hook for funding your retirement. At the same time, your costs in retirement are likely to be higher than they've ever been.\n\nCouples in their 60s should expect to spend over $250,000 in health care costs alone over the course of their retirements. If you plan to retire in New York, a million-dollar nest egg would only last you 16 years and 7 months assuming you spent a modest $5,000 per month.\n\nNow more than ever, your long-term financial health is up to you -- and it's harder and harder to maintain financial security and stability. You must set the appropriate retirement savings goals and contribute to them during your working years.\n\nIf that means saving less -- or not saving at all -- for college, then you need to cut back on how much you put toward college savings.\n\nSound harsh? It might, but we need to be realistic. Who else will fund your retirement if you don't? Do you really want to be a financial burden on your children in their adult lives?\n\nThe burden of parents who cannot pay their own expenses will likely be more of a challenge for your children than responsibly choosing a school they can afford and taking out a reasonable amount of student loan debt.\n\nThe Real Problem with Student Loans (and What to Do Before You Borrow)\n\nBefore we go any further, let's dig into that point more. Yes, student loans are tough for people who have them.\n\nBut there's a big difference between graduating with something like $25,000 in student loan debt but with the ability to get a job out of school that pays $50,000 -- and graduating with $100,000 in student loan debt with job prospects that will probably only pay $15 per hour.", "description": "Here's a message that all parents need to take to heart: It's OK to put yourself ahead of your kids. In fact, putting your retirement needs ahead of their college costs is not only necessary but wise ... and, ultimately, thoughtful, too.", "authors": ["Paul V.
