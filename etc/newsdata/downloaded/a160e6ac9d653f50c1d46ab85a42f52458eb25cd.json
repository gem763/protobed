(Submitted by Mark Rutherford)\n\nAnd he has support from on high.\n\nThe mayor of Clarington, the municipality that encompasses Orono, told CBC Toronto's Here & Now the proposal has energized people in his community and given them a spotlight they don't often get.\n\n\"It's a lot fun. It's a great initiative,\" Mayor Adrian Foster said. \"All kinds of people are hearing about Orono that perhaps didn't know that Orono existed.\"\n\nHe said if it all works out, the city will install the sign on the local fairgrounds overlooking the highway.\n\nIt was never built to last\n\nToronto's big block letter sign was first installed at Nathan Phillip Square outside city hall for the 2015 Pan-Am and Parapan-Am Games.\n\nIt was supposed to come down after the Games ended, but it turned out to be such a popular selfie-magnet, the city has maintained the temporary structure far beyond its originally planned lifespan.\n\nLast week, Toronto announced it would replace the sign with something more permanent.\n\nThe city says it will replace the 2015 block letters with something more permanent. (Michael Wilson/CBC)\n\nBut Rutherford says he isn't worried about the durability of the letters.\n\n\"We're a small town and we're pretty ingenious,\" he said.\n\n\"I've got a lot of friends who are fabricators and builders and construction people that have all thought this is a great idea and have already offered to provide us with free labour and small community spirit to make this sign as best as can be and last in our community.\"\n\nCity mulling it over\n\nBut Toronto might not be willing to part with the letters.\n\n\"I am willing to talk to them,\" Toronto Mayor John Tory told CTV News. \"Each letter stands on its own, but I look at it as something that shouldn't be broken up.\"\n\nResidents of Orono, which is part of the municipality of Clarington, Ont., are hoping to acquire Toronto's discarded block letters \u2014 or most of them, anyway. (Submitted by Mark Rutherford)\n\nThe mayor's spokesperson Don Peat said it's too early in the process to say what will happen to the letters, but that Tory has been in touch with Clarington's mayor about the proposal.\n\n\"We appreciate the interest that Orono residents have in the Toronto Sign,\" Peat said in an emailed statement. \"It's an iconic sign so we understand why they might want it.\n\nWhat happens to the extra Ts?\n\nRutherford, meanwhile, doesn't plan to give up any time soon.\n\nHe says the sign would be good for the town of roughly 1,100 people, which gets fewer visitors since a divider was built on in the highway to improve traffic safety more than 30 years ago.\n\n\"It's become a bedroom community and over the last, you know, four years the economy is changing and we've lost our CIBC bank, we've lost our Foodland, we've lost our LCBO and some other stores have struggled,\" he said.\n\n\"Any bit that we can have to help us draw people into our community is fantastic.\"\n\nHe even has some ideas about what to do with the Ts.\n\n\"I can probably sell them to the Tom Thomson museum or something like that to put some money back into the project,\" he said with a laugh.\n\n\"We've even had suggestions of putting the Ts in close location to the sign ... with a thank you to the City of Toronto for donating the letters to us.\"\n\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear with files from Here & Now.
