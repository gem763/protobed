In the Middle East, where tension and war have led to a surge in arms sales, Washington and Moscow often compete for the same clients.\n\nThough the United States generally claims to offer superiority, some weapons systems produced by Russia are challenging that. Chief among them is the S-400 missile defense system, a widely-touted \u2014 though ultimately untested \u2014 rival to the U.S.-made Patriot missile system.\n\nThe attack on the oil facilities in the Saudi districts of Khurais and Abqaiq on Saturday morning appeared to involve cruise missiles and drones that were able to avoid detection by and activation of Saudi Arabia\u2019s missile defense system.\n\nNotably, that system includes Patriot batteries and it is generally designed to combat ballistic missiles and airplanes that can be spotted from further away.\n\nAs cruise missiles and drones can fly closer to the ground, the curvature of the earth makes them harder for radar to spot unless the radar is elevated.\n\nRussia\u2019s systems are capable of using mobile radar masts to combat this problem. The S-400 is also designed to operate in any direction, whereas Patriot systems are limited to whatever direction they are set up in: some analysts have suggested that many of the Patriot batteries deployed near the oil facilities targeted on Saturday may not have been looking in the right direction to deter the attack.\n\n\u201cThis Saudi attack shows the absolute imperative of 360 degree capability,\u201d said Tom Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nWhile Russia\u2019s S-400 system may have impressive specifications on paper, many analysts are cautious in their assessment of it. It has not been fully tested in real life, whereas the Patriot system successfully intercepted missiles during both the Gulf War and the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.\n\nSome research has also pointed to potential weak spots in the S-400\u2032s system. Russia\u2019s military industrial complex is known for its secrecy about potential military failures: in recent months, the country has seen a mysterious missile explosion and a deadly accident on a nuclear submarine, while last year a covert Russian mercenary group in Syria suffered a humiliating defeat by U.S. forces.\n\nBut Moscow disputes the efficacy of U.S. weapons as well. As Zakharova said Friday, Russia dismissed the impact of missile strikes by the United States, along with Britain and France, in April 2018 on targets in Syria after the use of chemical weapons by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nAt the time, Russia claimed that Syrian air defenses had shot down 71 of 103 missiles fired; the Pentagon denied this figure and Moscow provided no evidence. Russia has supplied antimissile systems to Syria, but it said that S-400s deployed to protect a Russian base in Syria only monitored the attack.\n\nFor all the rivalry between American and Russian weapons systems, the battle has mostly played out on the political level so far. Moscow has courted a number of U.S. allies to purchase Russia\u2019s missile defense systems, which cost considerably less than their American counterparts. India and Qatar have publicly mulled buying the S-400.\n\nNATO ally Turkey announced it intended to buy the system this summer, prompting the United States to suspend Turkish involvement with the American F-35 program. Kathryn Wheelbarger, U.S. acting assistant secretary of defense, had said in May that the \u201cS-400 is a Russian system designed to shoot down an aircraft like the F-35,\u201d an advanced U.S. stealth fighter.\n\nIn theory, the range of missiles carried by an F-35 should allow it to destroy an S-400 before it is detected by its radar, but that idea has not been tested in practice. Both Washington and Moscow likely hope that it will never will be: For both countries, a little ambiguity can be lucrative.", "description": "\"The brilliant US air defense systems could not repel an attack,\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Friday.", "authors": ["Adam Taylor", "Foreign Reporter Who Writes About A Variety Of Subjects"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V4XBB3G2GII6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
