Audiences also want to see amazing artists, of course, which is why Netflix ordered ten episodes of the hip-hop competition show, which features performers from Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York squaring off in an American Idol-style reality show. However, if anyone is primed to achieve (or surpass) Simon Cowell, Michael Kors and Tyra levels of judgement, it\u2019s Cardi B, swerving wildly on a golf cart alongside her fellow judges Chance the Rapper and T.I. Rhythm + Flow premieres on Netflix October 9.", "description": "Cardi B joins Chance the Rapper and and T.I. in the first look at Netflix\u2019s upcoming hip-hop and competition show Rhythm + Flow.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/1-Cardi-Rhythm-Flow.w1200.h630.jpg"}
