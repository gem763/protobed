The mediation session is not finalised and it is still being facilitated by a retired judge,\" he said.\n\n\"We are disappointed by the department for going public that a settlement has been reached, which is not correct,\" Jones added.\n\n\"We have written to the head of the department, whether what was said earlier was a statement from the department. As lawyers acting on behalf of the family, they find the statement by the department hurtful, especially noting that the case has not been finalised.\"\n\nWhen contacted, Mhlungu requested that questions be sent to him before he could confirm or deny his earlier statement.\n\nAt the time of publishing, he had not responded.", "description": "The South African Human Rights Commission in Gauteng has denied claims by the Gauteng Department of Health that a settlement was reached with the family of a pensioner who was shackled to a hospital bench.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4312/535821d585f74e33b4db2d751d62409b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
