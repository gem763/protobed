His work visa expired while he was on a trip to China. When he applied for its renewal, however, he was rejected by Belgian authorities.\n\nTheir decision to impose the Schengen ban infers he is viewed as an espionage threat by security services, the De Morgen newspaper reported.\n\nMr Song was the director of the Confucius Institute at the VUB (Free University Brussels), a department said to benefit from 200,000 euros a year in money from the Chinese government.\n\nScrutiny has intensified around the world regarding Confucius Institutes, language and cultural centres that operate on university campuses.\n\nWhat separates these institutes from organisations like the British Council is that they fall directly under the Chinese ministry of education, which ultimately reports to the ruling Communist Party\u2019s central propaganda department.\n\nUS and UK politicians have raised concerns about the risks Confucius Institutes pose in terms of academic freedoms, and potential theft of proprietary research on university campuses.", "description": "The head of a Chinese language and cultural institute at a Brussels university has been banned from Belgium after security services accused him of being a spy.", "authors": ["Sophia Yan", "James Crisp", "China Correspondent", "Brussels Correspondent", "Allister Heath", "David Goodhart"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/30/TELEMMGLPICT000214620334-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
