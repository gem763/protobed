It should be my right to choose how I treat my cancer,' she told Nine News.\n\nMs Burns was diagnosed with bowel cancer in January and underwent surgery in August to remove the lower part of her colon, where she was then fitted with a permanent colostomy bag.\n\nBefore undergoing chemotherapy, Ms Burns decided to give cannabis oil a try after thorough research about its benefits for cancer patients.\n\nShe purchased cannabis oil from the black market and estimates she spent a hefty $10,000 since her diagnosis. She also continued to grow her own cannabis.\n\nResults were clear within two weeks as Ms Burns said she could sit down without any discomfort.\n\n'Within two weeks of being on the oil, I could sit again. It just took all the inflammation down. It was amazing the difference it made,' she told the publication.\n\n'I know my pain dropped dramatically. I was able to cut out a lot of painkillers. I didn't need Endone during the day.'\n\nShe purchased cannabis oil from the black market and estimates she spent a heft $10,000 since her diagnosis (stock image)\n\nHer doctor however, said there is no evidence the cannabis oil helped shrink her tumour and causing the cancer cells to disappear from her lymph nodes.\n\nMs Burns said she has no regrets for her decision to treat herself with cannabis oil but said she would have preferred to wait to do the surgery which has left her with a permanent colostomy bag.\n\n'The end result is they took away my choice of how to treat myself, I had to do the surgery,' she said.\n\n'I didn't have a back up option of keeping on the oil and then seeing the results.'\n\nMs Burns and her partner will face Colac Magistrates' Court in January.", "description": "Alice Burns, 54, was arrested and charged in June following a police tip off which led to a search of her home in Victoria's\u00a0Otway Ranges.", "authors": ["Sahar Mourad For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/06/19820280-0-image-a-23_1571288992431.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
