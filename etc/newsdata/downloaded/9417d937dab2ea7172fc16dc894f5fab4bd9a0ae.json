These so-called red giants then begin to lose their outer layers of material into space. More than half of such a star's mass can be shed in this manner, forming a shell of surrounding gas. At the same time, the star's core shrinks and grows hotter, emitting ultraviolet light that causes the expelled gases to glow.

As such, it could be just the beginning in a major change in the activity of the black hole.\n\n\u201cThe big question is whether the black hole is entering a new phase \u2014 for example if the spigot has been turned up and the rate of gas falling down the black hole \u2018drain\u2019 has increased for an extended period \u2014 or whether we have just seen the fireworks from a few unusual blobs of gas falling in,\u201d said Mark Morris, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and the author of a paper describing the discovery..\n\nScientists will now keep looking at the area and hope that new images can help resolve that question. That could in turn help us understand how black holes grow and the kinds of effects they have on the galaxy and the larger universe.\n\nThe brightening could have come from the fact that a star was seen going very close to the black hole in summer last year, or that another mysterious object known as G2 had its outer layer ripped off when it passed by in 2014. It might also be the result of big asteroids passing near the black hole, scientists said.\n\nThe black hole poses no danger to life on Earth. It is 26,000 light years away, and the radiation coming out of it would need to be 10 billion times brighter to have any effect here.", "description": "The huge black hole at the heart of our galaxy has turned unusually bright \u2013 and scientists have no explanation for the dramatic behaviour.
