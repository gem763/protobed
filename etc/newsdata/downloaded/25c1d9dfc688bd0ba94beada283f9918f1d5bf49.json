But now, the United States, Britain, and Australia have signed an open letter requesting that the firm suspend these plans as it could have a negative effect on the fight against child exploitation and terrorism.\n\nSpeaking on a livestream during the company\u2019s weekly internal Q&A session, Zuckerberg announced he was aware this could be an issue and acknowledged that encryption would reduce the number of tools available to fight the problem. Zuckerberg stated: \u201cWhen we were deciding whether to go to end-to-end encryption across the different apps, this was one of the things that just weighed the most heavily on me.\u201d\n\nWhen questioned by one employee about the issue of child pornography, Zuckerberg admitted that no longer being able to access the content of messages sent on the platform would mean that \u201cyou\u2019re fighting that battle with at least a hand tied behind your back.\u201d But Zuckerberg stated that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that the firm would still be able to identify predators in its encrypted system using the same tools used to fight election interference.\n\nZuckerberg also suggested that the company may limit the level of interaction that adults are able to have with minors on the platform. The decision to move messaging platforms to an encrypted service was divisive within Facebook. Privacy engineers eager to put the Cambridge Analytica scandal in the past and product managers who saw the success of encrypted messaging app WhatsApp all supported the move.\n\nBut Facebook\u2019s safety team immediately argued against the plan raising concerns surrounding the distribution of child pornography and exploitation of minors on the platform. In their joint letter, the United States, Britain, and Australia stated that they had been in contact with Facebook but that the firm had not committed to addressing their \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the effects of encryption.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
