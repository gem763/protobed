The former Democratic congressman said in the most recent Democratic debate that he is willing to confiscate people\u2019s guns to prevent mass shootings. It\u2019s now all out there in the open. The Democratic Party, which has been anti-gun for years and been covertly pushing an agenda to destroy the Second Amendment, finally came out and announced it publicly. They\u2019ve walked on eggshells on this issue because they know it drives GOP voters to the polls and Independent voters away from them. It already cost them the 2000 election. But in the Obama years, we heard phrases like \u201ccommon-sense gun control,\u201d \u201cthe Australian mode,\u201d and the former president himself even used the United Kingdom as an example of nation\u2019s that he thought had good gun laws. Yeah, both of those nations enacted bans and confiscatory measures to enforce their laws. Laws that would be unconstitutional. We know if you give the anti-gun Left an inch, they\u2019ll take several hundred miles. Not here.\n\nWith the recent spate of mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, anti-gun fever has kicked up again. Robert Francis decided he wanted to make a play to corner the anti-gun wingnut vote. Oh, you might know this clown better by his culturally appropriated nickname, Beto, but that\u2019s for another time. Some Democrats are gung-ho about the idea because they hate guns, gun owners, rural voters, and Republicans. In war, this is the correct mindset. To destroy one\u2019s enemy completely, you must strip him of his cultural identity. Guns are very much ingrained in American society. Liberals want to upend that because they\u2019ve taken an explicit anti-American tone in recent election cycles. Conservatives retaliate with stricter laws on abortion because baby-killing is a tradition that\u2019s cherished by the Left.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then, there are Democrats who think Beto\u2019s antics will set back gun control years, creating endless political ammunition by the GOP and others to clip Democratic attempts at confiscating law-abiding citizen\u2019s private property. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX) was on CNN, where he threw cold water on the gun confiscation proposal, though said he was for stronger background checks. That appears to be the main battleground. Gonzalez is a gun owner. He said he bought a shotgun at a gun show and didn\u2019t undergo a background check. Whether this happened is unknown, but it\u2019s also not an illegal transaction. It\u2019s a private sale, which like mass shootings, are rare and not the cause for these tragedies.\n\nGonzalez says he wants universal background checks and closing of gun show loopholes. The issue here is that federally licensed firearms dealers still have to run background checks at these gun shows or anywhere where they can make a transfer. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a myth to say there\u2019s a gun show loophole. As for the shotgun transfer that Gonzalez undertook, that\u2019s a private sale. Those are still legal, so no loophole.\n\nHe also wants to get at the root as to why we have these shootings, which again, are still rare, violent crime is still at historic lows, and the country is not a shooting gallery. Like most Democrats, Gonzales peddled an exaggeration, but there could be common ground since he seems to want answers that go beyond \u2018guns are scary,\u2019 which is the default position of the Left.", "description": ".09/25/2019 0:35:31AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/263/306a19ff-b5e0-48fd-aefa-3be0177fc5f3.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
