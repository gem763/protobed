Touting increasing farm trade, Putin said Moscow will soon send flu vaccines to Caracas, which has seen its economy crippled by U.S. sanctions. \u201cWe consider this part of our humanitarian cooperation,\u201d Putin said.\n\nRussia is also fulfilling its obligations under agreements to service weapons already delivered to Venezuela, Putin said. The Interfax news agency said later a new group of Russian military specialists had arrived there.\n\n\u201cWe always feel very comfortable in Moscow,\u201d Maduro said, calling the meeting \u201cvery important.\u201d\n\n\u2018No Illusions\u2019\n\nThough Putin didn\u2019t specifically refer to the breakdown in talks between Maduro and Guaido, he highlighted the importance of the contacts. \u201cWe consider any rejection of dialog irrational, harmful to the country and a threat to the prosperity of the population,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two leaders aren\u2019t expected to sign any agreements during the visit, according to the Kremlin. Putin said trade turnover between the two countries is up 10% and that Russia has invested about $4 billion in Venezuela so far.\n\n\u201cMoscow has no illusions about the situation in Venezuela and clearly understands that Maduro can\u2019t guarantee any investment returns. There can\u2019t be any big economic projects with Venezuela now,\u201d says Dmitry Rozental, deputy director of the state-run Institute of Latin America in Moscow.\n\nThe trip is Maduro\u2019s first major international one this year after facing an intense battle for power at home, where Guaido has challenged his position as the legitimate head of the nation. The opposition\u2019s efforts to take over Miraflores Palace have stalled after a botched uprising in April.\n\nRussia has been a strong backer of Maduro as the U.S. has stepped up pressure on the Venezuelan leader. But Moscow has in recent years been reluctant to grant new economic support for the struggling government, which is still repaying billions in past loans, in part with oil supplies. Maduro last visited Russia in December 2018, just days before two Russian strategic bombers made a trip to Venezuela, drawing protest from the U.S.\n\nRussia has also been a major weapons supplier. In June, the Kremlin denied a tweet by U.S. President Donald Trump saying that Putin had told him that Moscow was withdrawing most of its military advisers from Venezuela.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Stepan Kravchenko in Moscow at skravchenko@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.
