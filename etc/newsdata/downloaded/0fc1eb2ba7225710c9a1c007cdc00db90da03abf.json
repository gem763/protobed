'I want to be Donald Cerrone'", "language": "en", "text": "TAMPA, Fla. \u2013 When Mike Davis received an offer four days before UFC on ESPN+ 19, he didn\u2019t hesitate to accept it.\n\n\u201cBeast Boy\u201d Davis (14-4 MMA, 0-1 UFC) steps into the cage for his second promotional appearance when he takes on Thomas Gifford (17-8 MMA, 0-1 UFC) at UFC on ESPN+ 19.\n\nThe event takes place Saturday at Amalie Arena. The card streams on ESPN+.\n\nDavis, a Dana White\u2019s Contender Series alumnus, had prepared for a fight on Sept. 28 at UFC Copenhagen. When his opponent, Danny Henry, had to pull out due to injury, Davis turned down a replacement opponent in order to mend some injuries of his own.\n\n\u201cNow here we are a few weeks later,\u201d Davis told reporters, including MMA Junkie, on Thursday at media day. \u201cLuck happened, I guess. I\u2019m still in shape. I\u2019m still decent enough in shape. I feel great, actually. A 155 opportunity came up, so I might as well take it.\u201d\n\nDavis indicated he wants to compete as much as possible in the future. The American Top Team lightweight walks around at approximately 165 pounds, so the weight cut isn\u2019t as drastic as some of his fellow 155 pounders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 161,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI\u2019m not heavy at all. I got the call at 165. I don\u2019t get heavy. \u2026 I want to be Donald Cerrone. You call me, I\u2019m going to fight. I\u2019m good. I\u2019m good. I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d\n\nBoth Davis and Gifford lost their promotional debuts earlier this year at UFC on ESPN+ 8 in April. Davis was submitted by longtime UFC fighter Gilbert Burns with a second-round rear-naked choke. Gifford dropped a unanimous decision to Roosevelt Roberts.\n\nDuring their first fight week, the two fighters met. Six months later, Davis expects to engage in a \u201cfriendship kind of brawl.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know Thomas,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI met him in Fort Lauderdale. We fought on the same card, we debuted together, and he\u2019s a great guy. I think it will be a friendship kind of brawl and then we\u2019ll go have a beer afterwards.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna say he\u2019s a grappler, but he likes to strike. That\u2019s exactly me. I\u2019d 100 percent say I\u2019m a wrestler or grappler, but I will strike 100 percent. I won\u2019t even try to take you down, so it\u2019ll be an exciting fight.\u201d", "description": "Mike Davis steps in to the cage for his second UFC appearance when he takes on Thomas Gifford at UFC Tampa.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "Simon Head", "Dan Tom", "Matt Erickson", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/mike-davis-ufc-tampa-media-day-interview.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
