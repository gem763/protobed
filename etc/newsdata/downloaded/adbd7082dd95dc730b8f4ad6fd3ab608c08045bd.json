The ship is currently being held off the port city of Bandar Abbas on the southern coast of Iran.\n\nAn exact release date has not yet been given by Iran, but according to a statement made to Sweden's public broadcaster and quoted by Reuters, the head of the Swedish firm that owns the vessel, Stena Bulk, said following Sunday's announcement, that the tanker could be released within hours.\n\n\"We have received information now this morning that it seems like they will release the ship Stena Impero within a few hours,\" Stena Bulk Chief Executive Erik Hanell reportedly told SVT. \"We hope to be able to head out within a few hours, but we don't want to anticipate events. We want to see that the ship sails out of Iranian territorial waters.\"\n\nBut, by Sunday evening, the ship had still not been released.\n\nA spokesperson for Stena Bulk, Will Marks, told Reuters, \"The vessel is still being held and the negotiations are ongoing, and until we have official confirmation and the vessel is lifting up its anchor and sailing out of Iranian waters we can't confirm anything else.\"\n\nThere were 23 crew members of Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino nationalities aboard the Stena Impero when it was seized. On Sept. 4, seven of them were released, while the remaining crew members have reportedly remained aboard the ship.\n\nThe seizure was seen as an act of retaliation, since the British detained an Iranian oil tanker, the Grace 1, earlier that same month.\n\nThe Grace 1 was halted in the semiautonomous British territory of Gibraltar and was released in August after local authorities rejected U.S. requests to keep the tanker impounded.\n\nWhen the British first seized the Iranian tanker, they were acting at the request of the U.S., who suspected that the Iranian tanker was bringing oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions. Iran denied the claims and assured a court in Gibraltar that the tanker would not proceed to Syria, according to Bloomberg.\n\nNews of the Sterno Impera's impending release comes at a time of heightened tensions in the Middle East.\n\nHours before Iran announced plans to release the British tanker, Iranian President Hassan Rohani called on Western powers to leave the security of the Persian Gulf to regional nations under Tehran's leadership, according to The Associated Press.\n\nSeparately, Rohani also promised to unveil a regional peace plan at this week's upcoming United Nations' meetings.", "description": "The Stena Impero was detained by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on July 19 for alleged marine violations.
