This animal is darker.\n\n(Image: Shaun O\u2019Riordan / SWNS)\n\n\"All we know at this stage is it is dark-coloured.\n\n\"There are varying estimates of size, between five metres and 10 metres.\n\n\"That is consistent in description with a humpback and also other types, including a minke whale.\n\n\"We are working with British Divers Marine Life Rescue, who are monitoring the behaviour of the whale and the type of species.\n\n\"It is not an everyday sight, although we have had a number of whales in the Thames.\"", "description": "The body of the whale has been reported close to the Kent shore at Greenhithe and a Port of London Authority pilot boat has been dispatched to find the carcass", "authors": ["Tom Bull", "Danya Bazaraa", "Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Pa", "Ikm Pics Jim Bennett Vantagenews", "Shaun O Riordan", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20530968.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Humpback-whale-spotted-in-Thames.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
