Go ask him now,\u201d Giuliani told The Hill Wednesday when asked if Graham made a mistake by ruling out the possible appearance of Joe or Hunter Biden before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Judiciary Committee did not indicate Graham's position had changed, saying the senator will make a final determination on witnesses at a later date.\n\n\u201cOn witnesses, we\u2019ll hear from Giuliani and then determine what, if any, additional witnesses need to be called,\u201d said Taylor Reidy.\n\nGiuliani says the Bidens are key witnesses related to an investigation into corruption in Ukraine and allegations that interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election stemmed from Ukraine and not Russia.\n\n\u201cIf I were in the House and I had subpoena power, my first witness would be Joe Biden \u2014 for Trump. Because I would want to show the corruption that he unleashed in Ukraine that deprived us of the information that could have exonerated the president,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\n\u201cMy second witness would be Hunter and then a group of Ukrainians who would explain how they were engaged in vast corruption there, which would justify the president asking the president of Ukraine to follow up,\u201d he added, referring to a July 25 phone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBiden called for Trump's impeachment on Wednesday, the first time he has gone that far. The impeachment effort in the House centers on Trump's efforts to get Zelensky to investigate Biden.\n\nGraham expressed reluctance before the two-week congressional recess about delving into the allegations Giuliani has raised.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to turn the Senate into a circus,\u201d Graham said, adding he saw no reason to call Hunter Biden before committee. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do anything because we don\u2019t have any jurisdiction. I have no interest in opening up that front. I don\u2019t want to blow up the Senate.\u201d\n\nGraham also said he had no interest in calling Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrBudowsky: Biden and Warren at POTUS Rubicon White House tells Pelosi, committee chairs it won't cooperate with impeachment inquiry China rejects Trump call to investigate Bidens MORE before his panel to testify on Ukrainian corruption or Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, asserting it was the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s job.\n\nBut Graham appeared to shift course on Tuesday when he announced he will invite Giuliani to speak to his committee about Ukraine-related matters.\n\n\"I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the committee of his concerns,\" Graham said in a series of tweets, arguing that he was responding to the unfolding impeachment process in the House.\n\n\u201cGiven the House of Representatives\u2019 behavior, it is time for the Senate to inquire about corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nGraham said in an interview on Fox News Wednesday that he and Giuliani spoke the day before.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s claiming to have a lot of evidence about corruption in the Ukraine that ties back to the Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Rudy\u2019s got a story to tell. I want him to tell it in my committee. He\u2019d be respectfully treated.\u201d\n\nThe spokeswoman for the Judiciary Committee said the format of Giuliani\u2019s testimony, whether in open session or behind closed doors, is yet to be decided.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he believes Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) will call former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden to testify before his panel a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/giuliani_rudy_01232019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
