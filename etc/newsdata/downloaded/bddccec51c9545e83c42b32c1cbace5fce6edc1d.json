Money markets are pricing in an 82 per cent chance of a rate cut at the October 30 meeting, Refinitiv data show.\n\nThere was also poor data out of China, with third-quarter growth slowing more than expected to its weakest pace in almost three decades as the bruising US trade war hit factory output.

The EU wants it. Perhaps this week, a surly Parliament will put its numbers behind the PM's deal, writes Alexander Downer.\n\nUnited States\n\nThe S &P 500 index closed out an uneven week of trading on Wall Street with its second straight weekly gain, even though stock indexes ended lower Friday.\n\nTechnology companies led the slide, which erased the major US indexes' gains from the day before. Communication services, industrials and health care stocks also fell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestors continued to focus on company earnings reports. They're searching for a clearer picture on the impact that the trade war between the US and China is having on corporate profits and the broader economy.\n\n\"To some extent, the bleeding's stopped, but now you need to figure out how healthy the patient is,\" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. \"Earnings help with that, and economic data that we receive over the next couple of months will help with that.\"\n\nCoca-Cola gained 1.8 per cent while Johnson & Johnson fell 6.2 per cent after the company said it is recalling a single lot of its baby powder because a test found trace amounts of asbestos in one bottle.\n\nEurope\n\nInvestors are bracing for a frenzied trading day on Monday in the wake of an extraordinary weekend sitting of the UK parliament to push through Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.\n\nPaul O'Connor, head of the UK-based Multi-Asset Team at Janus Henderson, said markets will be very sensitive to the margin of victory if the deal is approved in Parliament.\n\n\"It's a recipe for investors to execute only the most necessary moves in advance, before a possible 'manic Monday' in Saturday's wake,\" said City Index analyst Ken Odeluga.\n\nShares in London's UK-oriented businesses, such as housebuilders and retailers, could rocket to record highs if parliament approves the government's Brexit deal, investors say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParliament's approving the agreement would mean UK equities were no longer \"uninvestable\", according to brokerage Bernstein.\n\nIt has also moved to an \"overweight\" on European stocks, naming a Brexit resolution as a \"catalyst to bring money back into European equities.\"\n\nLondon-listed stocks ended a mixed week on a cautious note. InterContinental Hotels and oil stocks weighed on the FTSE 100, which closed 0.4 per cent lower. InterContinental shares fell 4.6 per cent on Friday after the Holiday Inn owner said lower business bookings in China and protests in Hong Kong had caused a drop in revenue.\n\nUK-focussed mid-caps outperformed the blue-chip index and the European benchmark, which was dragged lower by a sharp fall in French carmaker Renault.\n\nAllocations to UK equities dropped to record lows of 7.46 per cent last month, according to Copley Fund Research, which tracks more than 400 funds with $US800 billion in assets under management. That compares with an average of around 9.2 per cent before the referendum.\n\nAsia\n\nThere were more disconcerting economic signals from China, which on Friday reported that its economy grew at its slowest pace in 26 years last quarter.\n\nThe 6 per cent growth pace China reported for July-September was worse than most economists were expecting, highlighting a global economy that is slowing. Domestically, Beijing is under significant pressure to head off job losses as a trade war with the US drags on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the latest data for September, such as investment and lending, showed improvement, but \"pressure on economic activity should intensify in the coming months,\" Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index gave up early gains, sinking 1.3 per cent while Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.5 per cent and the Kospi in South Korea skidded 0.8 per cent.\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe dollar fell sharply against the euro, with the European common currency bouncing on Brexit hopes. The euro was up 0.32 per cent at $US1.1158, a near two-month high. The pound was 0.45 per cent higher against the dollar at $US1.2946. The yuan held steady.\n\nFor the pound, 23 financial institutions polled by Reuters predicted on average that it would rise to almost $US1.34 - nearly 4 per cent above current levels. The most bullish predicted the currency would hit $US1.40.\n\n\"Investors are still short [sterling] and simply covering those shorts will push sterling above $US1.30,\" Normand added.\n\nCommodities\n\nThe outlook for commodities in 2020 is expected to brighten, Capital Economics said in a note.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We expect global economic growth to pick up over the course of the year, which in turn will prompt a rise in investor risk appetite. Both developments should give a boost to commodities demand,\" said Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist.\n\nIndustrial metals prices were volatile after China's economic growth slowed slightly more than expected to 6 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter, the weakest pace in almost three decades.\n\nLME benchmark zinc rose 0.7 per cent to close at $US2457 a tonne, the highest since July 30. LME lead gave up 0.4 per cent to $US2181 a tonne, reversing direction after hitting $US2214.50, the highest since July last year.\n\nSpot gold was little changed. \"The $US1380-$US1400 range ought to be a solid bottom for gold and $US1480-$US1520 seems really to be the equilibrium,\" says Tai Wong, head of base and precious metals derivatives trading at BMO.\n\nGold discounts in India narrowed to a four-month low this week as some consumers took advantage of a modest dip in domestic prices to buy bullion ahead of Diwali. India's gold imports plunged 68 per cent year-on-year in September to their lowest in over three years as record domestic prices curbed retail buying.\n\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to 1.7396 per cent compared with a US close of 1.755 per cent on Thursday.\n\nAustralian sharemarket\n\nProfit expectations and dealmaking helped lift the Australian market in a week where Latitude's IPO collapsed and high-profile technology firms Afterpay and WiseTech came under significant selling pressure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The big news was the Latitude float,\" said Hugh Dive at Atlas Funds Management. Latitude abandoned its $3.2 billion initial public offering this week after failing to secure sufficient interest at $1.78 a share.\n\n\"It's probably good for the market,\" said Mr Dive. \"There could have been some potential selling.\"\n\nThe S &P/ASX 200 index declined 34 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 6649.70 in Friday's session, paring weekly gains to 0.7 per cent.\n\nStreet Talk", "description": "Investors are in for another busy week of corporate earnings, including McDonald's on Tuesday, Boeing and Microsoft on Wednesday, and Amazon on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7212%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_288%2C$y_71/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6b025a0bca0f3c2025055bd201c87544accf7cfc", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
