The problem leaves the cars unable to charge and has appeared in vehicles that are four years old.\n\nVice News reports that some older Tesla cars are facing issues with their onboard flash memory, resulting in the car\u2019s computer system bricking itself according to three independent Tesla repair professionals. The issue arises with the cars\u2019 eMMC chip which is embedded on a board called MCU1; two experts who have studied the issue claim that the Tesla vehicle writes memory to these chips so often that they eventually go bad.\n\nYouTuber Rich Benoit discussed the issue with another Tesla repair professional named Phil Sadow in a video, stating: \u201cTesla\u2019s got a problem. They create so many logs in the car, they write to [the chip] so fast that it basically burns them out. They have a finite amount of writes. When this burns out, you wake up to a black screen [in the car\u2019s center console.] There\u2019s nothing there. No climate control. You can generally drive the car, but it won\u2019t charge.\u201d\n\nSadow suggests that this problem appears to arise in Tesla vehicles after about four years of driving but it can often vary. While some Tesla owners have not experienced the issue whatsoever, others have posted to official message boards about the problem.\n\nOne of the factors making this issue worse is that Tesla is not bound by the same rules that other manufacturers are when it comes to repairs. Tesla is not party to a memorandum of understanding which was signed by other auto manufacturers in 2014 in which they all agreed to sell parts to independent repair shops. This means that there are very few independent Tesla repair professionals and acquiring the parts to repairs Teslas is very difficult.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building these parts in the aftermarket because Tesla won\u2019t sell these parts,\u201d Sadow said. Benoit told Motherboard: \u201cI see it in the wild. I own a shop that repairs these cars and the older vehicles are starting to show their signs of age.\u201d\n\nBenoit stated that he has a collection of replacement motherboards he has salvaged from wrecked teslas in case he starts to repair this issue for customers. \u201cAt the moment, we do not provide this service as we would like to form a partnership with Tesla to help them resolve these issues,\u201d he said.\n\nMusk tweeted at another independent repair professional named Jason Hughes that the issue \u201cshould be much better at this point,\u201d but did not elaborate on what his team had done to fix the problem.\n\nIn the past month I've done repairs/replacements on over a dozen @Tesla MCUv1 units for customers suffering from eMMC flash failure.@elonmusk, you really need to tell the engineers to fix the logging wear in /var. It's literally killing a huge percentage of these units. \u1f61 \u2014 Jason Hughes (@wk057) October 9, 2019\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
