It\u2019s a team full of world-class players and to be given the chance to work with some of the players who I worked with a few years ago is really exciting. I can\u2019t wait to get started and see where we can get to.\n\n\u201cEngland are the current 50-over world champions and they made it to the final of the last ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a very competitive side and they wouldn\u2019t be in big matches like that if they didn\u2019t have a really strong group of players who can perform on the big stage. I\u2019m really looking forward to getting under way and helping the team progress.\u201d", "description": "Former Australia international Lisa Keightley has been named as the first full-time female head coach of England Women.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/30/TELEMMGLPICT000214582881-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwQDeh2-auJJMrGwEf6cEfK4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
