Firstly, it creates defensive momentum and forces the attack to take a few steps back to realign their process.\n\n\"And a guy like Faf is really good at it. He picks his moments \u2013 he sort of drifts behind the line and then rabbits out to make big spot tackles, usually on the big forwards, which I\u2019ve got to say is quite impressive from a little guy.\n\n\"He\u2019s got a big heart, and he\u2019s solid defensively. He\u2019s a great guy to have in your side.\"\n\nTurning his attention to Wales, Louw said the Boks would not make the mistake of taking their opposition lightly.\n\n\"I think it is an understatement to say they are an outside team trying to win the World Cup. Bookmakers are there to make money,\" he said.\n\n\"From a rugby perspective, they\u2019ve been playing consistently well for the last few years, and even floated as the No 1 in the world for a few days or hours.\n\n\"At no stage would anyone underestimate them. You do that at your peril. They are a fantastic outfit, a very well organised and structured side which wholeheartedly rely on their systems to perform.\"\n\nThe Boks will name their side for Sunday's match on Thursday.", "description": "Springbok loose forward Francois Louw has praised scrumhalf Faf de Klerk ahead of Sunday's World Cup semi-final against Wales.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9487/ff93c027b0ef4dfd824ba9ad3c3552a9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
