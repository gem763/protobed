Knocking circus peanuts off the throne. Which is really saying something,\u201d wrote CandyStore.com in a blog post.\n\nCandyStore.com came up with its list after reportedly surveying over 30,000 of its customers on their least favorite Halloween candy, and \u201cmashed\u201d those findings with data from 12 prominent online rankings of the best and worst candies. Those that ranked lowest on the online lists received a score of 10 points, while those that ranked highest were scored with 1 point.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nEverything was tallied together, and when the sugary dust cleared, candy corn ended up on the bottom \u2014 a result that somewhat shocked the blogger behind CandyStore.com.\n\n\u201cCandy corn is nothing special.
