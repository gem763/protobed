GM wants to freeze a base wage this year for a second year in a row, a plan opposed by its South Korean union which has said it could stage a full strike this month.\n\nRenault Samsung, a unit of French automaker Renualt SA , also plans to cut production starting next month, with shipments of Nissan's Rogue SUV to the United States to be phased out this year, clouding job prospects.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Transport - [SEOUL] Hyundai Motor's unionised workers in South Korea voted on Monday to accept the lowest bonus offered in nearly two decades amid widespread restructuring in the auto industry and a damaging trade dispute with Japan. .
