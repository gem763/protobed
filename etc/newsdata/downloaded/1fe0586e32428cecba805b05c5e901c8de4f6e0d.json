But the larger issue was that the Browns looked like a group of players still getting to know one another.\n\nIn the first game of his second season, Mayfield completed 25 of 38 passes for 285 yards and one touchdown, but was sacked five times and intercepted three times in the fourth quarter. All three led to touchdowns, including a late pick-6 by Malcolm Butler, and Mayfield\u2019s margin of defeat was the largest of his career, either in college or the pros. He wasn\u2019t helped by the ejection of left tackle Greg Robinson early in the second quarter.\n\nIn his regular-season debut with the Browns, Odell Beckham Jr. was more notable for the wristwatch he wore \u2014 a Richard Mille model valued in the hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 than for seven receptions for 71 yards.\n\nOdell is playing with a Richard Mille on.\n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/WVoJ8wUNJo \u2014 Complex Sports (@ComplexSports) September 8, 2019\n\nFor the Titans, Mariota completed 14 of 24 passes for 248 yards and three touchdowns. Rookie A.J. Brown caught three passes for 100 yards and Henry rushed 19 times for 84 yards to go with his 75-yard TD reception.\n\nThe Browns now are winless in their last 15 season openers, a sobering statistic after the sky-high offseason expectations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a locker room full of disappointment right now, which we should have,\u201d said Freddie Kitchens after his head-coaching debut. \u201cThis is not the way we want to be represented. We lost our discipline, we lost our composure. \u2026 But it\u2019s one game. We\u2019re going to be tested. Adversity, you take it and you either run together and run toward each other, or run away. And we\u2019re going to run toward each other.\u201d\n\nTitans tight end Delanie Walker admitted he\u2019d heard the hype and trolled the Browns expertly after the game. \u201cThey were who we thought they were,\u201d he said, channeling Dennis Green\u2019s epic rant. \u201cYou all can crown 'em if you want to crown 'em, but you\u2019ve still got to play football.\u201d\n\nIt was a rough afternoon for Cleveland fans.\n\nbrowns fans rn pic.twitter.com/O5SVezitny \u2014 FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) September 8, 2019\n\n2019 Cleveland Browns hype and 2019 Cleveland Browns actual... pic.twitter.com/jPZ2KoFbpL \u2014 Colin Dunlap (@colin_dunlap) September 8, 2019\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nEagles beat Redskins 32-27 in season opener\n\nNick Foles sustains broken collarbone in Jaguars\u2019 loss\n\nChiefs\u2019 Tyreek Hill taken to hospital with sternoclavicular injury", "description": "Cleveland's hungry fans booed, sighed and left early.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5NXFT3GSN4I6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
