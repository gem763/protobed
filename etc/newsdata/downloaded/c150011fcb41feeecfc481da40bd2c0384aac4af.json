REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo\n\nFidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund\u2019s (FBGKX.O) manager Sonu Kalra had 2.7% of the giant fund\u2019s assets invested in Juul as of July 31, the latest fund disclosures show, up from 1.7% of assets a year earlier.\n\nAlthough Juul remains privately held, some Fidelity funds have made a practice of taking stakes in pre-IPO companies that have paid off big when they go public.\n\nBut the tactic can also put Fidelity fund holders into volatile situations like the one at rideshare leader Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N), which is trading well below its IPO price in May.\n\nJuul is the latest example of pre-IPO drama. On Wednesday the company\u2019s CEO stepped down as merger talks between its biggest investor Altria Group Inc (MO.N) and Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N) collapsed in the face of a regulatory backlash against vaping.\n\nProducts made by Juul and others vaporize liquid containing nicotine. While they can help people quit smoking, the company faces a U.S. ban on some products and concerns about illnesses linked to vaping.\n\nFlavored e-cigarettes represent 80% of Juul\u2019s sales. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s plan to pull all e-cig flavors from the market, along with bans in some markets already, have pushed Juul\u2019s valuation down to about $25 billion, from $38 billion when Altria invested in it, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nA spokesman for Boston-based Fidelity declined to comment. Fidelity\u2019s Kalra acknowledged scrutiny of Juul from regulators but wrote that \u201cJuul\u2019s success in penetrating the U.S. market and continuing to grow its sales and earnings supported a higher valuation for this position,\u201d according to a note to investors dated July 31.\n\nJuul was in the Fidelity\u2019s fund top 10 holdings at the end of July, sandwiched between Visa Inc (V.N) and Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N).\n\nJohn Bonnanzio, an editor of independent newsletter Fidelity Monitor & Insight, said the Juul stake has become risky but managers may be tempted by the chance to deliver outsize returns to help beat their benchmark and rival index funds.\n\nSome managers have decided, \u201cYou can\u2019t beat the index without investing outside of it,\u201d Bonnanzio said.\n\nBlue Chip Growth\u2019s three-year average annual return of 17.1% is better than 79% of peer large cap growth funds, according to Morningstar Inc.", "description": "Juul Labs Inc has become one the biggest bets in the portfolio of Fidelity\u2019s $28 billion Blue Chip Growth Fund, whose exposure to the troubled e-cigarette maker has climbed to $761 million amid a regulatory backlash and departure of its top executive.", "authors": ["Ross Kerber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433894291&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1YQ", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
