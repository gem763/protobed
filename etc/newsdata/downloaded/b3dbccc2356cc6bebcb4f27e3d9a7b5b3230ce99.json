Cleese has previously faced a backlash for voicing support for the UK leaving the EU, and for saying London was no longer an English city.\n\nGilliam told Radio Times that the only public figure he could trust in the current political climate was Sir David Attenborough. He also criticised the political correctness of contemporary comedy, but stopped short of supporting his friend\u2019s view of the world.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m the instinctive, monosyllabic American and he\u2019s the tall, very suave one. I love John enormously but I just disagree with the way he perceives the world.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest John Cleese has previously faced a backlash for expressing support for Brexit.

Good writing is what it\u2019s about, and that\u2019s why you hire people, not because they\u2019re this colour or that gender,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Is it funny?\u2019 is the only thing that should be asked. Comedians are treading carefully and this is terrible. I really want some comedians to really go for it again, but people are frightened of saying the wrong thing, of causing offence.\u201d\n\nTerry Jones: \u2018I\u2019ve got dementia. My frontal lobe has absconded\u2019 Read more\n\nGilliam, who renounced his US citizenship, said that although talents in Monty Python had an Oxbridge background, their material pushed diversity, and attacked the established order.\n\nRadio Times also interviewed Sir Michael Palin, another member of the comedy troupe, who said there was still a \u201csparkle\u201d left in his friend and fellow Python Terry Jones despite his diagnosis in 2015 with a form of dementia that affected his ability to communicate.\n\nThe pair met at Oxford before collaborating together in Monty Python, said there are still traces of Jones left despite the effects of his illness.\n\nPalin said: \u201cHe\u2019s still around, he\u2019s not disappeared, quite apart from the wonderful work that he left behind, the work he\u2019s done. There\u2019s still a bit of Terry there, the sparkle in the eye. He can\u2019t communicate, that\u2019s the problem, which is so ironic for someone who loved words and debate and jokes and opinions and ideas.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough of Terry there to make me feel grateful that I can still go and see him.\u201d", "description": "Director says Brexit makes him \u2018terminally depressed\u2019 while fellow Python Cleese backs it", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbd709cbf3c3a534aca2c34a318c16eb6f39f823/0_69_2408_1445/master/2408.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a709e7bae7fd3f14c06338ef29e9159b"}
