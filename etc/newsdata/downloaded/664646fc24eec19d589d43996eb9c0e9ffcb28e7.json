Audrina Patridge is still sort of directionless and sad-eyed, Justin Bobby makes even less sense than he used to, and Heidi and Spencer Pratt are, against all odds, still married and seemingly happy. Watching the revival, I have even learned about the whereabouts of people I forgot existed, like Frankie Delgado. (He\u2019s a nightlife impresario now, or at least that\u2019s what he definitely wants us to think.)\n\nBut watching these people interact over the last two months or so, I can\u2019t help but wonder: Where is Whitney Port?\n\nPort, 34, was one of the anchor characters in the original show, starting out as Lauren \u201cL.C.\u201d Conrad\u2019s intern friend at Teen Vogue and later fronting her own New York\u2013centric spinoff, The City. She was never the most dynamic personality, but she was a reliable presence on both shows. When MTV announced New Beginnings earlier this year, she was promoted as one of the main returning cast members, appearing on the cover of Cosmo with Patridge, Pratt, and surprise newcomer Mischa Barton. In an interview with Vogue last March, she explained her desire to return to the series: \u201cEven though we didn\u2019t all necessarily keep in touch every day, like, we went through something so crazy together that I just thought it would be cool to reconnect.\u201d\n\nWatching the show, it\u2019s hard to believe Port has reconnected with anyone. Whole episodes pass without an appearance from the intern turned fashion designer turned full-time mom influencer. She does not seem to be friends with anyone else in the cast and has not gotten involved in any of their story lines. Even Jason Wahler\u2019s wife, who did not appear on the original series and has no real reason to be in this one, has gotten more screen time than Whitney.\n\nTo be fair, it\u2019s obvious that no one in the current cast is particularly close anymore. But most of them are trying, at least, to create a shared narrative. Patridge is pretending to be mad at Stephanie Pratt for spending time with her ex-boyfriend Justin Bobby; Spencer Pratt is pretending to be mad at Brody Jenner for not visiting his baby; Brody Jenner is pretending to be married. Port, meanwhile, is living with her husband (whom she met when he was \u2014 get this \u2014 a producer on The City) and her young son doing, well \u2026 I\u2019m not sure. In episode six, \u201cI Don\u2019t Think We Can Be Friends,\u201d she identified herself as a content creator for an organic-baby-food company. Later in the episode, she FaceTimed Patridge for 20 seconds and then walked into her bedroom to do an extended advertisement for Crest Whitestrips. That was it. (It should be noted that every incidence of product placement this season has been truly jarring, from Patridge\u2019s wordless two-minute application of L\u2019Or\u00e9al mascara in episode two to Spencer and Heidi Pratt\u2019s constant faux-casual enjoyment of Sonic milkshakes in their home.)\n\nBeyond these little cameos, Port\u2019s not doing much on the show. Why? She doesn\u2019t seem to be worried about protecting her personal life. Off camera, she has a robust social media presence and frequently shares intimate details about her life with her 1.5 million Instagram followers. In the run-up to the premiere of The Hills: New Beginnings, she launched a podcast, With Whit, where she has discussed everything from her skin-care routine to her recent miscarriage in unflinching detail. Last month, she even revealed that she carried on a BBM-relationship with Leo DiCaprio in the late 2000s and ultimately turned down an invitation to go home with him from a club. \u201cI was way too nervous to do it and then I lost my chance and it\u2019s really one of my bigger regrets in life,\u201d she said.\n\nThat story should have been on The Hills! Instead we have been forced to watch Patridge rekindle her relationship with Ryan Cabrera and his acoustic guitar. It\u2019s simply not right.\n\nIt does seem that Port is aware of her disappearance from the show. In recent weeks, she has launched a new, surreal series on her YouTube channel where she watches and reacts to the episodes, \u00e0 la The Peoples\u2019 Couch. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be on next week,\u201d she wrote in the description box for her watch of episode seven, in which she did not appear.\n\nAnd on a recent episode of her podcast, she addressed the issue directly. \u201cA lot of people are asking why I haven\u2019t really been on this season of The Hills: New Beginnings,\u201d she said seriously. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a couple reasons. One, I feel like there is so much drama in everybody else\u2019s lives that I am not part of that it just didn\u2019t make sense for me to naturally show up in these places or have these conversations. Two, my husband, Timmy, didn\u2019t really want to be on it, so I think the producers thought it was kind of like, Hands off Whitney.\u201d\n\nHmm, well, yes, that would explain it. She assured listeners, however, that she wants to be on the show more in the future. Filming the early episodes, \u201cI was a little bit scared \u2026 because I just didn\u2019t know what everybody was like, and I didn\u2019t know the drama people were going to cause,\u201d she said. \u201cI had heard rumblings to just be careful, that people could come after me, so I was really timid at first.\u201d\n\nOh, Whitney. It\u2019s hard to argue with her strategy, which is the kind of plan a chemically balanced, family-oriented person would make to approach reality TV. But it has not succeeded in getting her screen time. Perhaps it is time to accept that our mid-2000s Teen Vogue queen is not cut out for MTV\u2019s modern demands.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m normal,\u201d she concluded on the podcast. \u201cAnd I feel like people on reality TV are usually not the most normal.\u201d", "description": "As the first season of \u201cThe Hills: New Beginnings\u201d winds down, I feel confident that I am caught up on the lives of most of the cast members from the original series.
