Baden, who was hired by Epstein\u2019s brother and observed the autopsy, told Fox News its findings are more consistent with homicidal strangulation than suicidal hanging. He noted that the 66-year-old Epstein had two fractures on the left and right sides of his larynx, specifically the thyroid cartilage or Adam\u2019s apple, as well as one fracture on the left hyoid bone above the Adam\u2019s apple, Baden told Fox News.\n\n\u201cThose three fractures are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation,\u201d Baden, who is also a Fox News contributor, said.\n\nWhile there\u2019s not enough information to be conclusive yet, the three fractures were \u201crare,\u201d said Baden, who's probed cases involving O.J. Simpson, President John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, record producer Phil Spector, New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez and many others.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case,\u201d the 85-year-old medical legend told Fox News.\n\nEPSTEIN'S ATTORNEYS 'NOT SATISFIED' WITH AUTOPSY RESULTS THAT CONCLUDED FINANCIER DIED BY HANGING\n\nBaden, who's examined more than 20,000 bodies and hosted HBO's \"Autopsy,\" explained that if a person weighed 120 pounds and their head weighed 10 pounds, there would be 110 pounds of pressure on the neck at the jaw during a hanging. But, if someone put a hand around a person's neck and squeezed, that could double or even triple the pressure on the neck, Baden said.\n\nThere were also hemorrhages in Epstein\u2019s eyes that were common in homicidal strangulation and uncommon, though not unheard of, in suicidal hangings, the forensic pathologist said.\n\n\u201cThe prominent hemorrhage in the soft tissues of the neck next to the fractures is evidence of a fresh neck compression that could have caused the death,\u201d Baden said.\n\nBaden stressed his independent study was not complete. \u201cThe investigation is not completed until all the information has come in,\u201d he said.\n\nEpstein was found hanging in his prison cell at the high-security Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan and was later declared dead, investigators said.\n\nProsecutors alleged that the previously convicted sex offender paid girls as young as 14 hundreds of dollars for massages before he molested them in his homes in New York and Palm Beach, Fla., between 2002 and 2005. He was awaiting trial in federal prison, thus federal agencies -- presumably the FBI and Justice Department -- had jurisdiction over the investigation into his death, Baden explained.\n\nSOME JAIL STAFFERS NOT COOPERATING WITH DOJ INVESTIGATION INTO EPSTEIN SUICIDE, SOURCE SAYS\n\nHe said it was unknown to him and the Epstein family what work the feds may have done and what results they might have.\n\nThe ligature, or item used to tie something tightly, allegedly was made from a sheet that had been twisted and put around Epstein\u2019s neck, Baden said. Evidence on the cloth material could help prove whether or not someone else was involved in Epstein's death.\n\n\u201cWhoever it is would have their DNA all over the ligature,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have those results yet,\u201d he added, saying those results \u201cshould be reported quickly to give an idea and lessen the speculation.\u201d\n\nNew York City Medical Examiner Barbara Sampson ruled Epstein\u2019s cause of death to be a suicide by hanging.\n\nNEW YORK MEDICAL EXAMINER: JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S DEATH WAS A SUICIDE BY HANGING\n\n\u201cIt appears that this could have been a mistake,\u201d Baden said. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence here of homicide that should be investigated, to see if it is or isn\u2019t homicide.\u201d\n\nEpstein previously was discovered on July 23 -- over two weeks before his death -- on the floor of his prison cell with marks around his neck, after which he was placed on suicide watch.\n\nHe was taken off suicide watch a week later and put in another cell with a roommate, Baden said -- but the second inmate was taken out a few days after that, leaving Epstein alone in the cell.\n\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN'S FORMER EX-COP CELLMATE AT NYC LOCKUP MUST HAVE BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS, JUDGE RULES\n\nOn the day Epstein was found dead, the prison security had experienced a \u201ctotal breakdown\u201d in procedure, according to Baden.\n\n\u201cIt was determined that the two guards who were supposed to be working in that area of the prison had allegedly fallen asleep and hadn\u2019t made their 30-minute rounds for more than 3 hours,\u201d he said.\n\nJAIL WHERE JEFFREY EPSTEIN DIED HAS EGREGIOUS HISTORY OF SECURITY BREACHES\n\nThen there were security cameras that were supposed to be recording the cell and the hallway outside, to see who went in and out. Both apparently had malfunctioned, according to Baden.\n\nMark Epstein, Jeffrey\u2019s next of kin, had hired Baden to perform an independent investigation because the family wasn\u2019t getting answers -- and if his brother\u2019s death was, in fact, a homicide, \u201che and others may be at risk,\u201d Baden said, \u201cbecause of somebody not wanting knowledge given out.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThrough his five decades of experience, Epstein\u2019s death is not straightforward, Baden said.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t give you the answer,\" he said. \"It's not a typical hanging case.\u201d", "description": "The forensic pathologist hired by Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s brother to determine his cause of death revealed to\u00a0\"Fox & Friends\"\u00a0in an exclusive interview Wednesday\u00a0that the autopsy findings are more consistent with homicidal strangulation than suicidal hanging.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon", "Melissa Leon Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
