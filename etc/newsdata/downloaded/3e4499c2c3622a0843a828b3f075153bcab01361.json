You're right.\n\nChaudry and Fry were at the Royal Albert Hall for an event where they wore the ER badges\n\n'We live high carbon lives and the industries that we are part of have huge carbon footprints.\n\n'Like you \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 we are stuck in this fossil-fuel economy and without systemic change, our lifestyles will keep on causing climate and ecological harm.\n\n'There is, however, a more urgent story that our profiles and platforms can draw attention to.\n\n'Life on earth is dying. We are living in the midst of the 6th mass extinction.\n\n'For those who still doubt the severity of our situation, here is the International Monetary Fund on 10th October 2019 :\n\n'Global warming causes major damage to the global economy and the natural world and engenders risks of catastrophic and irreversible outcomes.'\n\n'And here is Sir David Attenborough on 3rd December 2018 :\n\n'Right now, we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale.\n\n'Our greatest threat in thousands of years. Climate change. If we don't take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.'\n\nThe open letter goes on: 'Climate change is happening faster and more furiously than was predicted. Millions of people are suffering, leaving their homes and arriving on our borders as refugees.\n\n'Alongside these people who are already paying the price for our fossil fuelled economy, there are millions of children - called to action by Greta Thunberg - who are begging us, the people with power and influence, to stand up and fight for their already devastated future.\n\n'We cannot ignore their call. Even if by answering them we put ourselves in your firing line.\n\nAlthough Colman and Carr (above) are supporters of Extinction Rebellion, they haven't signed the letter where stars say they must go on fighting the cause despite their carbon footprint\n\nJuliet Stevenson (left) and Ruby Wax (right) are two A-listers who were pictured at the XR protests in central London that caused chaos to commuter to highlight climate change\n\nUS comedian Ruby Wax (left) and British actor Juliet Stevenson (right) sit with activists gathered on Westminster Bridge during the controversial demonstration\n\n'The stories that you write calling us climate hypocrites will not silence us.\n\n'The media exists to tell the public the truth.\n\n'Right now there has never been a more urgent need for you to educate yourselves on the CEE (Climate and Ecological Emergency) and to use your voices to reach new audiences with the truth.\n\n'We invite all people with platforms and profiles to join us and move beyond fear, to use your voices fearlessly to amplify the real story.\n\n'Thousands of ordinary people are risking their freedom by taking part in non-violent civil disobedience.\n\n'We've been inspired by their courage to speak out and join them. We beg you to do the same.\n\n'With love.'\n\nComic Steve Coogan told MailOnline: 'Extinction Rebellion is a grass roots movement that should be applauded for putting this issue at the top of the agenda where it belongs.\n\n'I stand in full support of these brave, determined activists who are making a statement on behalf of us all.'\n\nActor Jamie Winstone added: 'I will continue to change my life for the greater good for the planet.\n\n'I will continue to push for climate justice\u2026we all need to change the way we live our lives for a healthier living planet and stop living in denial that climate crisis isn't real.\n\n'It's happening. We all need to make changes if we want to survive and our children to thrive.'\n\nPhilanthropist Aileen Getty said: 'When one considers that we are facing extinction, XR's actions do not seem to be radical at all.\n\n'In fact, to protect ourselves and those we love with all our might is simply common sense.'\n\nMusician Jarvis Cocker blasted the media for attacking celebrities who endorsed XR.\n\nHe said: 'This is a clear-handed and honest letter. Journalists could learn a lot from it and start covering the story of the thousands who are taking part in the protest rather than slagging off those in the public eye who happen to support them.'\n\nOne XR activist said: 'It's great that these big stars are backing us. We appreciate it and believe that people are beginning accept at our arguments and objectives more closely.\n\n'We are not militants and are a peaceful group and we will carry on our campaign long after this fortnight of action is over.\n\n'We will keep coming back. We need to save the planet from being destroyed while we can.'\n\nMany Londoners may be anxious to say 'good riddance' to XR who have cost the tax payer millions in their London campaign.\n\nToday the High Court will be targeted and on Thursday the London tube network.", "description": "The stars were just a few of 100 celebs to sign a letter supporting XR.
