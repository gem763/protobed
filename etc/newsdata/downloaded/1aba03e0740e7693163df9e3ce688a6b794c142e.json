They can open any sort of activity: a bread shop, a stationery shop, a restaurant, anything. It\u2019s a way to breathe life into our towns while also increasing the population.\u201d\n\nWhich cities have the oldest residents?

People also need infrastructure and a reason to stay, otherwise we\u2019ll end up back where we started in a few years,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat), Molise, with a population of 305,000, is among the regions that has lost more inhabitants in recent years \u2013 in excess of 9,000 have left since 2014.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A mural of the Molise flag.

Not a single birth was registered in nine of its towns.\n\nFor the first time in 90 years, the number of Italian citizens living in Italy has fallen to about 55 million, according to Istat.\n\nIn 2014-18 the number of Italian citizens resident in the country fell by 677,000. Two factors are behind the decline, according to experts: a decrease in births, which is at an all-time low since the unification of Italy, and an increase in the migration of young people to other European countries in search of job opportunities. Nearly 157,000 people left the country in 2018, Istat said.\n\nItaly is the only major European economy whose population is expected to decline further in the next five years, the UN has said. It ranks second \u2013 behind Japan \u2013 as the country with the greatest proportion of older people, with an estimated 168.7 over-65s for every 100 young people.\n\nHappy As Lazzaro review \u2013 disturbing jaunt across time to Italy's feudal shame | Peter Bradshaw's film of the week Read more\n\nIn an attempt to resuscitate these towns, several mayors, such as the one in Sutera, in the province of Caltanissetta in Sicily, have opened the doors of their vacant homes to asylum seekers who have crossed the Mediterranean from Libya.\n\nOthers, such as Sambuca, which are determined do anything it takes to survive, have adopted a strategy that has become fashionable in the south: sell, or practically give away, abandoned homes to anyone willing to move in.
