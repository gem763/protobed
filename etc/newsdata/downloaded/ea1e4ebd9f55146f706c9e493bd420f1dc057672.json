Are you willing to fight to ensure that every American has health care as a human right even if you have good health care? Are you willing to fight for frightened immigrant neighbors even if you are native-born?\"\n\nIt's an addition to Sanders\u2019 stump speech and notable for sending an implicit message to voters who are not yet supporting him. The Vermont senator has struggled to expand his base so far in the presidential race.\n\nThe Sanders campaign estimated about 26,000 people attended the Saturday event, making it the biggest rally of any Democratic candidate this year. It was Sanders' first rally since he suffered a heart attack at the beginning of the month.\n\nSanders\u2019 spot also highlights a diverse array of rallygoers. His aides have said the endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 as well as one from Rep. Ilhan Omar \u2014 demonstrates the multiracial working-class coalition that he is building.\n\nIn addition to the first paid ad featuring Ocasio-Cortez, the Sanders campaign unveiled this weekend a video featuring her endorsement of Sanders. It has nearly 3 million views on Twitter.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/2d/31/e337b1a04526a5e43fce4825ee5d/20191022-aoc-sanders-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
