On Thursday and Friday, around 1600 officers will be posted around the mosque site as tens of thousands of visitors are expected to clog up the streets.\n\nSymbol of influence\n\nThe massive building embodies the Brotherhood's rise, said researcher Cheikh Gueye.\n\nThe Mourides \"dominate trade, import-export, agriculture and even the media,\" he said. The mosque is a \"symbol of this economic power, which will help reinforce their political and cultural influence.\"\n\nThe lavish interiors include a gold-leaf dome, giant chandeliers and decorations hand drawn by Moroccan workmen.\n\n\"With this jewel, we are on a par with what we see in Arab countries and other places in Africa,\" said Mbackiyou Faye, who coordinated the construction work.\n\nThe cost exceeded 30 million euros ($33m), all of which came from donations, he said.\n\nThe government has additionally provided 10.5 million euros for lighting, sanitation and road works, according to Infrastructure Minister Oumar Youm.\n\nThe mosque is smaller than Casablanca's Hassan II - which is spread over nine hectares, can accommodate 105,000 worshippers and has a minaret spiralling 210 metres.\n\nAnother mosque being built in Algiers is sprawled over nine hectares with a 265-metre minaret. It will be able to accommodate 120,000 people.\n\nThe Mourides are one of four important Sufi brotherhoods followed by Senegal's Muslims, who overwhelmingly practise a moderate version of Islam while following the teachings of local spiritual guides.\n\nBamba, a peaceful opponent of French colonialism, was exiled by the French authorities to Gabon from 1895 to 1902 and then to Mauritania from 1903 to 1907 before being allowed to return to Senegal, where he was placed under house arrest at his home in the north of the country. He died in 1927.\n\nThe holy city of Touba, founded by Bamba in 1888, has grown to be Senegal's second-largest after Dakar, with some 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\nThe mosque will be inaugurated at 1400 pm (local and GMT) in the presence of President Macky Sall.\n\nAn Islamic institute, residence and museum are scheduled to be added to the complex in the future.", "description": "Senegal's influential Mouride Brotherhood on Friday will inaugurate a 30,000-capacity mosque in the capital Dakar, touted as the largest in West Africa and rivalling its opulent peers in Arab nations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9405/6b5141ff98f34fec9e7bc62127839426.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
