She will get to pick those board members if two people currently on the board, Bruce Dunlevie and Steven Langman, step down.\n\nAnother possible change being considered is taking Rebekah Neumann out of this role, the source added.\n\nDespite receiving lukewarm interest in its shares, the We Company is pressing ahead with an initial public offering and may seek a valuation as low as $15 billion to $18 billion in its IPO, down from the $47 billion value it commanded in the last private fundraising round in January.\n\nThe news on plans to curb Neumann's voting power was earlier reported by the Financial Times.\n\nWe Company declined to comment on changes in the corporate governance.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Joshua Franklin in New York and Bharath Manjesh in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Philip George in Bengaluru; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Sherry Jacob-Phillips)", "description": "An announcement on the corporate governance could come as soon as Friday, the source said, cautioning that the plans are still subject to change and that no final decision has been made.
