The firm\u2019s traders also boosted revenue, helping pushing profit above analysts\u2019 estimates. Gains in advisory fees also surpassed rivals in the best quarter for the investment-banking unit in more than two years.\n\nThe 27% increase in fees shows progress by corporate and investment-banking chief Matthew Koder, who\u2019s overhauling the unit after executives admitted last year they had pulled back too much on risk. Koder is reinvigorating efforts to clinch more midsize transactions in the U.S. and has been adding dozens of bankers across the division.\n\n\u201cWe have, over the last four or five quarters, boosted the intensity in that business,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said on a call with journalists. The lender has encouraged staff in its commercial and wealth-management units to cooperate on bringing in more business, and \u201cwe\u2019re seeing some results -- we\u2019re seeing the number of deals in our pipeline go up,\u201d Donofrio said.\n\nAlison Williams, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said the investment-banking results benefited from being compared to a relatively soft third quarter a year ago, but she said the performance was \u201cstill impressive, especially in the M&A line, and that\u2019s an area that investors have been a little bit more worried about.\u201d\n\nChief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan expressed confidence in the U.S. economy even as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates and growth estimates are revised down. Lower borrowing costs are a major headwind for banks, while concerns about a global economic slowdown and trade tensions stymie client activity.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. economy is still in solid shape, despite the worries and concerns about trade wars, capital-investment slowdowns or other global macro conditions,\u201d Moynihan said on a conference call with analysts. \u201cAcross nearly every line of business, we are seeing strong customer activity.\u201d\n\nLoan Growth\n\nIn the consumer division, net income climbed 5.3% to $3.3 billion as loan and deposit growth drove net interest income higher, according to a statement from the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company. Wealth-management profit rose 8.3% to $1.1 billion.\n\nBank of America\u2019s net interest income -- revenue from customers\u2019 loan payments minus what the company pays depositors -- rose 1% to $12.3 billion in the third quarter, matching the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The company said it was sticking with its forecast for 1% NII growth this year.\n\nBank of America shares advanced 2.4% to $30.45 at 9:36 a.m. in New York. They\u2019ve gained 25% this year, compared with an 18% increase for the KBW Bank Index.\n\nThe bank broke its four-quarter streak of record profits as it took a $2.1 billion impairment charge tied to the end of its payments joint venture with First Data Corp. Its 18-quarter streak of positive operating leverage also came to an end.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. on Tuesday posted a surprise jump in revenue from investment banking, as well as the biggest increase in fixed-income trading revenue in almost three years. But Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported a bigger drop in investment-banking fees than analysts had predicted, down 15% from last year\u2019s third quarter.\n\n(Updates with analyst\u2019s comment in fifth paragraph, CEO\u2019s comments starting in seventh.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Lananh Nguyen in New York at lnguyen35@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.
