Photo: Elsa/Getty Images\n\nWhen I was a baseball kid growing up central Illinois, there was no greater hero than Whitey Herzog, the White Rat. He was the manager and general manager of my beloved Cardinals, the leader of those old Ozzie Smith\u2013Willie McGee\u2013Vince Coleman Astroturf speed demons. Whitey was a manager carved from midwestern granite, with a military-style crew cut, a thick wrestler\u2019s build, and a tendency to say tough-guy things like, \u201cI\u2019m not buddy-buddy with the players. If they need a buddy, let them buy a dog.\u201d He was famous for his friendship with Cardinals owner and beer magnate Augustus \u201cGussie\u201d Busch, with whom he\u2019d go fishing and to whom he would promise, no matter what, that he would win a championship. That was all Herzog and Busch wanted: championships. Within days of taking over the Cardinals in 1981, he traded away nearly half the roster, sending out multiple Hall of Famers, in a frenzied attempt to get \u201cole Gussie\u201d a title before he died. (Gussie was 82.) Some of the trades worked \u2014 one of them brought in Ozzie Smith \u2014 but many didn\u2019t, and the trades were called Whitey\u2019s Riverboat Gamble by the press. But they were motivated by one thing: winning, and winning right now, damn the long run. He\u2019d internalized economist John Maynard Keynes famous maxim, \u201cIn the long run we are all dead.\u201d Herzog ended up winning that World Series for Gussie the very next year. He\u2019s now a legend in St. Louis and in the Hall of Fame himself. He won his title. That was all that mattered.\n\nBaseball has changed rather dramatically in the nearly 40 years since Whitey\u2019s big dice roll, and now, well, they are clearly listening to different economists than John Maynard Keynes. On Sunday night, nearly 10 months after the team he helped construct won the World Series, Boston Red Sox team president Dave Dombrowski was fired by the team\u2019s ownership group. This is partly because the Red Sox are going to miss the playoffs this year while the hated Yankees are breezing to a division title, and this is partly because the Red Sox have turned into a bit of a Steinbrenner Lite organization, having now jettisoned each of the men (all men, though it\u2019s worth noting that the current highest-ranking executive in Boston now that Dombrowski is gone is a woman, Raquel Ferreira) responsible for each of their four titles over the last 15 years. But the real reason Dombrowski was fired, and the one that explains the best how baseball works in the year 2019, is that Dave Dombrowski cares too much about winning right now. In baseball today, that will not do.\n\nNow, obviously, every baseball team wants to win; it is easier to talk the taxpayers into paying for your stadium renovations when you\u2019re winning, after all. But on the list of priorities for team owners and general managers in the world of baseball as it is currently constructed, to paraphrase Vince Lombardi, winning isn\u2019t everything \u2026 and it\u2019s definitely not the only thing. It\u2019s probably not even the top thing.\n\nDombrowski has a long history in Major League Baseball as a general manager of the Montreal Expos, the Florida Marlins, and the Detroit Tigers, and while he made his name as a franchise-building, long-term-planning architect, he had his biggest successes later in his career as the baseball equivalent of a house flipper. With both the Tigers and the Red Sox, he joined organizations with deep farm systems but struggles at the major league level and went about gutting them, shipping out young talent unlikely to blossom for several years to bring in expensive current stars. He mortgaged the future to win now. He made two World Series in Detroit but never won one, but he helped build that dominant 2018 Red Sox team by trading for Chris Sale and signing pricey free agents like J.D. Martinez. He did not care about what the Red Sox would look like in 2026. He cared about what they looked like in 2018. And what they looked like was champions.\n\nThat should have been the pinnacle, setting Dombrowski up for years to come. But that\u2019s not how baseball works now. And the reason, of course, is money. For the Red Sox to win that championship, they had to raise their spending near baseball\u2019s luxury tax, which is complicated, but is perhaps best thought of as a punitive tax (as much as 50 percent) on any payroll over $206 million. The idea of the luxury tax is to keep rich teams from having a major competitive advantage over poor teams, which would make sense if there were, in fact, any poor teams. MLB had a record $10.3 billion in revenue in 2018 \u2014 increasing for the 16th consecutive year \u2014 and because of various revenue-sharing deals and the recent sale of streaming service BAMTech, which put at least $50 million in the pockets of every owner by itself, there are no \u201clow revenue\u201d franchises anymore. Which means the only real purpose of the luxury tax is to suppress salaries by making sure the top teams can\u2019t just spend freely for the talent to make their team better. It theoretically makes all teams the same. But it mostly makes controlling spending paramount \u2026 more paramount than winning.\n\nThus, baseball, now run mostly by Wall Street hedge-fund types rather than old-timey, chaw-chewin\u2019 baseball men, has become as much an efficiency exercise as a competition. All teams are incentivized to concentrate their efforts on younger, cheaper players who are cost controlled for six years, rather than focus on the here and now. Teams don\u2019t have to push to win right now, because they\u2019re already making money right now. Thus, they can concentrate on \u201cstreamlining\u201d the organization, making cost-efficient decisions with the promise of future spending, you know, when it makes more sense. This was popularized by the Cubs and the Astros, teams that cut their payroll for years of noncompetitive seasons while repopulating their farm systems with talent, then spending when their teams were ready; both franchises won World Series as a result. But what has happened is that owners, now flush with cash anyway, are using the Cubs and Astros\u2019 tactics as an excuse to pocket the money themselves while pretending they are \u201cbuilding for the future.\u201d The Pirates are the most egregious example of this, but there\u2019s a little bit of this mentality in every team in baseball. It\u2019s the ugly side of Moneyball: Fans want to win, owners just want to make money, but the quantification of efficiency has pulled those two goals out of alignment.\n\nThe Red Sox and Dombrowski, briefly, flew in the face of this: In many ways, spending now and not building for the future to win now has become the new market inefficiency. They were the rusty nail in baseball, the new A\u2019s, doing something the other 29 teams in baseball weren\u2019t doing, trading like crazy, acting as if, insanely, the point of running a baseball team was to win as soon as possible. But when the Red Sox took a step back this year \u2014 and it\u2019s worth noting they still have a better winning percentage in 2019 than the Mets have had in three years \u2014 the ownership group looked around, saw everyone else in baseball with a better profit margin than them (thanks to that looming luxury tax), despite not having that recent championship that they did, and decided it was the perfect opportunity to jettison Dombrowski and get with the program. Red Sox brass have been curiously quiet in publicly justifying the move, but Sports Illustrated\u2019s Tom Verducci reported that the team was looking for a \u201ca process-oriented architect who can steer the franchise efficiently through a difficult transition toward its next championship team.\u201d That sounds \u2026 that sounds like every team in baseball. It sounds like the Red Sox are getting with the program. Dombrowski wanted to win too fast. That\u2019s no way to keep your job.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Whitey Herzog way of business is remembered far more fondly that it should be. Herzog\u2019s seat-of-your-pants approach had run out of gas by the late \u201980s, and he ultimately resigned. It is worth noting that Herzog didn\u2019t blame his poor decisions for the team\u2019s eventual failings; he said it was because \u201cI can\u2019t get the guys to play,\u201d an indictment of the players, not himself. Within the next few years, he was saying that \u201cminorities\u201d were getting advantages because of \u201creverse racism\u201d and cracking \u201cracist jokes about the black dude in the elevator\u201d in an infamous Pat Jordan profile. The old way is not always better. The old way has its own problems. But in baseball today, \u201cthe old way\u201d is synonymous with \u201cdesperately trying to win.\u201d Of all the things I imagined someday becoming old-fashioned in sports, winning certainly wasn\u2019t one of them.", "description": "Boston Red Sox team president Dave Dombrowski was fired by the team\u2019s ownership group.
