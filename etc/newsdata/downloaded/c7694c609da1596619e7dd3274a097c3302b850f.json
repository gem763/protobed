Days ahead of the election, the Trump administration cut $160 million in direct funding to Afghan authorities, citing corruption.", "description": "Kabul (AFP) \u2013 Preliminary results from Afghanistan\u2019s presidential elections have been delayed for nearly a month, officials announced Sunday,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/916c44_afghanistan-presidential-election-in-september-saw-record-low-turnout-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
