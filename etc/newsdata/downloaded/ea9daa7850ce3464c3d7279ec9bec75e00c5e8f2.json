Just one of the grim statistics Mr. Riley noted: In New York City, more black pregnancies end in abortion than in live birth. This doesn\u2019t mean that Planned Parenthood promotes abortion so America will have fewer black citizens. But it\u2019s undeniable that this is the outcome of what they are doing.\n\nContrary to Mr. Tribe\u2019s tweet, the real white supremacists understand and celebrate this. On AltRight.com, someone writing under the name Aylmer Fisher warns against \u201cthe pro-life temptation,\u201d because abortion helps weed out \u201cthe least intelligent and responsible members of society,\u201d who are disproportionately \u201cBlack, Hispanic and poor.\u201d Ditto for Richard Spencer, the white nationalist who in May 2017 led protesters carrying torches and shouting \u201cyou will not replace us\u201d after the Charlottesville, Va., City Council voted to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee from a downtown park. Unlike pro-lifers, who want to be \u201cradically dysgenic, egalitarian, multi-racial human rights thumpers,\u201d he says, \u201cwe want to be eugenic in the deepest sense of the word.\u201d\n\nAgainst these white nationalists stand the pro-lifers, and not just on behalf of African-American babies. They also speak for the unborn child with Down syndrome, for the child conceived in rape or incest, for the unplanned pregnancy that will undeniably crimp any career plans a mother might have if she carries the baby to term. These are all hard cases, and the clarity of the pro-life proposition\u2014the insistence that each of these lives is no less precious than any other human life\u2014can make for a difficult political sell.", "description": "", "authors": ["William Mcgurn", "Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": ""}
