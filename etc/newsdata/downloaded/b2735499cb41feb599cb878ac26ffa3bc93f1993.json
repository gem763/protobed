Bernie Sanders.\n\nCrowd sizes are a metric of enthusiasm to be sure, and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign has a lot of Democratic primary voters fired up. It bolsters the argument of her supporters that she can get voters who didn\u2019t show up for Hillary Clinton in 2016 to turn out in 2020.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the energy on display Monday will propel her to the Democratic nomination next year, but the images coming out of Donald Trump\u2019s hometown of New York City will likely get under his very thin skin.\n\nFollow Sean Colarossi on Facebook and Twitter", "description": "During a speech at a rally in New York on Monday, a massive crowd turned out to hear Warren tear into the unprecedented corruption of the Trump era.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.politicususa.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/warren-nyc-crowd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
