The initiative, called the Competitive Price Adjustment program, only lowers merchants' prices temporarily, and sellers cannot request to be part of it. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nWalmart's move is likely a reaction to Amazon's recent initiatives that enable it to better compete on price.\n\nSold by Amazon, which launched in August, gives Amazon the ability to control the prices of third-party goods on its marketplace. Merchants can voluntarily join the program, and they receive a guaranteed minimum payout so that they're not impacted by Amazon's discounting, per CNBC. This allows Amazon to ensure its marketplace prices are as competitive as possible, and it can leverage its tremendous revenue to afford to offer steep price cuts if it wants to.\n\nAmazon is now offering free next-day delivery for inexpensive items, even if the transactions cost it money because of shipping expenses. To buy individual low-price items and receive free next-day shipping with Prime, a consumer's total basket previously needed to be worth at least $25; alternatively, they may have had to buy a pack of an item instead of just one. But by offering fast and free delivery for individual items, Amazon can better compete on price with other retailers, including stores, which may be worth it even though it loses money on shipping because it can increase consumers' reliance on Amazon.\n\nKeeping up with Amazon on price, though extremely difficult, is key to competing with the e-commerce titan given price's influence on purchase decisions. Eighty-two percent of US consumers who shopped on Amazon in the last two years said that price was a very important influence on their product selection, making it the most popular answer, per a report from Feedvisor.\n\nAnd with 82% of respondents saying they check prices on Amazon before making a purchase, retailers like Walmart can't avoid competing head-to-head with Amazon in many cases. So, even though cutting prices to match or improve on Amazon's prices can be extremely costly, finding ways to get close is necessary to avoid losing sales to Amazon.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
