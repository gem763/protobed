Cambridge Analytica worked for the 2016 Republican presidential campaigns of both Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nWhile Cambridge Analytica has since shut down, Wylie said the tactics it used could be deployed elsewhere, and that is why data privacy regulation needs to be dramatically enhanced.\n\n\"Even if the company has dissolved, the capabilities of the company haven't,\" he said. \"My real concern is what happens if China becomes the next Cambridge Analytica, what happens if North Korea becomes the next Cambridge Analytica?\"\n\nChina's regulation of the internet is the most severe in the world, according to a 2018 report from nonprofit Freedom House. In addition to controlling its own citizens' data, China also is \"providing like-minded governments with technology and training that enable them to control their own citizens,\" Freedom House wrote.\n\nWylie also said he believes that social media companies should, at a minimum, face regulation similar to water utilities or electrical companies \u2014 \"certain industries that have become so important because of their vital importance to business and people's lives and the nature of their scale.\"\n\nIn those cases, \"we put in place rules that put consumers first,\" he added. But he pointed out, \"You can still make a profit. You can still make money. But you have to consider the rights and safety of people.\"\n\nThe power of Big Tech and the appropriate regulation restraints to safeguard users and competitors are key areas of inquiry in a number of antitrust investigations being conducted by the FTC, Justice Department, state attorneys general and committees on Capitol Hill.", "description": "\"Just because it's not the state doesn't mean that there isn't harmful impacts that could come if you have one or two large companies monitoring or tracking everything you do,\" says Christopher Wylie.", "authors": ["Kevin Stankiewicz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105074903-Screen-Shot-2018-03-19-at-3.41.15-PM.jpg?v=1529477782", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
