That\u2019s no longer the case, though.\n\nRecent studies find that women are initiating sex a lot more than they used to, although most research still finds at least a small gender gap. For example, I surveyed more than 4,000 Americans about their sex lives for my book Tell Me What You Want and found that while 22 percent of heterosexual women in relationships said they rarely or never initiate sex, just 13 percent of heterosexual men said the same.\n\nThese numbers suggest that the vast majority of straight men and women today are taking the sexual lead at least sometimes; however, it\u2019s clear that a sizeable minority exists that isn\u2019t initiating sex very much, and women are more likely to fall in this camp than men.\n\nInitiating sex infrequently\u2014or not at all\u2014isn\u2019t necessarily a problem. After all, some people\u2014regardless of gender\u2014are content to take on a submissive sexual role. Research has found that a lack of sexual initiation is only harmful when it\u2019s inconsistent with one\u2019s sexual preferences. In other words, it\u2019s only when people have a desire to be sexually assertive but don\u2019t feel able or empowered to do so that they experience negative consequences.\n\nMost of the heterosexual women I surveyed (42 percent) said they were happy with how often they initiated sex. The remaining women, however, were pretty evenly split: 28 percent wanted to initiate more often, while 29 percent wanted to initiate less often. The numbers for lesbians were very similar.\n\nWhen looking at heterosexual men, 44 percent were content with their sexual assertiveness; however, 21 percent wanted to initiate more, and 35 percent wanted to initiate less. The breakdown for gay men was almost identical. The fact that more guys wanted to give up rather than take control in the bedroom may surprise you, but it makes perfect sense: Research has found that men in relationships want to feel wanted\u2014and what makes them feel desired more than anything else is when their partner initiates sex.\n\nIt seems clear from all of this that there are a lot of us\u2014in fact, a majority\u2014who either want to initiate sex more often or want their partner to start taking the lead. So what can we do about this? How can we get the right balance of sexual initiation in our relationships if we don\u2019t already have it?\n\nBefore answering that question, it\u2019s important to recognize that there are a large number of things that interfere with people\u2019s interest in and ability to initiate sex. Biological factors (health conditions, lack of sleep, painful sex), psychological factors (stress, mood state), and social factors (relationship conflict, children) are all things that tend to put the brakes on both sex and sexual initiation.\n\nMore from VICE:\n\nThe starting point, then, is really removing as many roadblocks as you can. What are the things that are preventing you and/or your partner from initiating sex more often? If you can identify the cause, you can start making concrete changes.\n\nFor example, a lot of people have this mindset that sex is something that only happens right before bed\u2014but after a long day, odds are that one or both of you won\u2019t be in the mood. Or maybe sex does sound good, but you\u2019re too tired to initiate. If this sounds familiar, you might think about switching things up and initiating sex in the morning instead. Or maybe you\u2019ll both agree to turn off your email in the evenings so that you can go to bed not feeling quite as stressed or distracted, which can open the door to sexual opportunities.\n\nEliminating roadblocks increases the odds that both of you will feel sexual more often, which means that if one partner initiates, it\u2019s likely that the other will be into the idea. However, while this is likely to help, we also need to address the fact that some of us just aren\u2019t sure how to initiate or we\u2019re afraid that our efforts will be met with rejection. So what are some common ways to initiate sex, and are there any approaches that are more well received than others?\n\nThere are two basic ways to initiate sex: directly or indirectly. Direct initiation is when you unambiguously convey sexual interest to your partner. For example, this might include asking your partner if they want to have sex, verbally expressing your desire to get it on, removing your clothing, or physically touching your partner.\n\nBy contrast, indirect initiation is when you convey interest in a way that\u2019s less obvious, such as kissing your partner, complimenting their appearance, or asking them if they want to cuddle. Research finds that both men and women tend to use indirect strategies more often than direct strategies. That might not necessarily be the most effective approach, however, given that direct cues tend to be recognized more often and are more likely to lead to sex.\n\nIn a 2012 study of heterosexual married couples who kept sex journals for two weeks, the cues most likely to be recognized as attempts to initiate sex were the ones that were most overt, like walking out of the bathroom naked, undressing one\u2019s partner, or directly asking for sex. These cues were also the most successful: Undressing one\u2019s self or one\u2019s partner led to sex 100 percent of the time, while directly asking resulted in sex 76 percent of the time.\n\nHowever, one direct strategy that didn\u2019t work quite as well was physically touching one\u2019s partner (things like crawling on top of your partner, rubbing up against their body, etc.). This wasn\u2019t always recognized as a sexual cue, it led to sex less often, and half of the time it occurred, the partner found it irritating or annoying instead of pleasurable.\n\nThis suggests that the use of touch as a sexual initiation strategy might be best coupled with verbal communication. Or maybe different types of touch should be considered: For example, rather than spontaneously rubbing or crawling on your partner, giving them a neck or shoulder massage might be a better start. Incidentally, back rubs are one of 17 things that sexually satisfied couples are more likely to do with one another.\n\nAs you can see, there are clearly a lot of different ways to go about initiating sex, and it should go without saying that different things are likely to work better for different people. So experiment, explore, and\u2014above all else\u2014talk about what both of you want.\n\nJustin Lehmiller, PhD, is a research fellow at The Kinsey Institute and author of the blog Sex and Psychology.
