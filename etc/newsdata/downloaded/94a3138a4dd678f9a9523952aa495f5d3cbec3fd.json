It\u2019s a story-based adventure game written in the snarky spirit of its point-and-click predecessors, full to bursting both with witty one-liners and signs that the writers maybe got a smidge too attached to some of the pop culture and philosophy references they penciled in. It\u2019s a touch overdone, but games of this genre tend to be indulgent by nature. For the most part, it\u2019s real good, knuckleheaded fun.\n\nLola and Milo are recent college graduates, and they are also dead. Playing as the pair of them, you\u2019re trying to find a way to escape hell while figuring out exactly how they died and why they\u2019re in hell in the first place. In Afterparty\u2019s vision of eternal damnation, demons are stuck in a cycle of bureaucracy and partying that none of them are too thrilled about. Humans are tortured, but only during the demons\u2019 regular business hours, after which they\u2019re free to go out partying and get fucked up\u2014aside from the occasional visit from their Personal Demon, who appears with the regularity and convenience of a menstrual period. So that\u2019s exactly what Lola and Milo do, soon discovering that they can escape hell if they outdrink Satan himself.\n\nThe path to drinking Lucifer under the table largely involves schmoozing with people (the enjoyable part) and playing the occasional drinking game (as in real life, more fun on paper than in practice). Honestly? There\u2019s not much puzzling or figuring out of things to do. The real draw is messing around in the dialogue trees, seeing what happens if you do something silly or illegal, also as in real life.\n\nThe awkward Milo and dry Lola weren\u2019t particularly popular in college, and it\u2019s obvious that navigating the deer-in-headlights feeling of trying to break into a new social scene is not their forte. With a backdrop of lush, hellish backgrounds and a vibrant nightlife, Afterparty does a great job of capturing the relentless string of anxiety-inducing moments you experience on a night out, from waiting in a stupidly long line to the pathetic shame of trying to parley with a dead-eyed bouncer.\n\nYou get a constant stream of dialogue options to choose from, but what shakes things up is alcohol. Drinking in Afterparty unlocks different dialogue options, depending on the specific cocktail. There\u2019s the Bloody Stool, which gives the \u201cFlirty Floozy\u201d effect, or the Famous Last Words, which gives you the bold, unhinged bearing of a \u201cPrison Bully.\u201d It was a blast to see what different drinks unlocked in different situations. Lola gets hilariously mean when she\u2019s belligerent, and Milo\u2019s unyielding awkwardness somehow blends into everything he does. There\u2019s also the fact that Lola and Milo keep having to make choices which could literally damn other humans\u2019 souls for all eternity, making these choices equally fun and fucked up.\n\nWhat really ties the package together is the voice cast, who do a great job of striking a balance between hammy and conversational. I\u2019m always a sucker for people who can affect a naturalistic tone with patently silly lines, and the delivery mixed with the audio editing make for some pretty funny moments. The hapless Milo (Khoi Dao) continually gets cut off midsentence and roasted by bored, petty demons. Janina Gavankar\u2019s deadpan works great on realist Lola, a bright, probably depressed young black woman who walked away from the church, much to her family\u2019s dismay. I found her incredibly relatable.\n\nThe solid supporting cast includes Ashly Burch, who\u2019s great as lively, surprisingly friendly demon Sam Hill, and Dave Fennoy, who plays a charismatic, but overworked and jaded, Satan. Even the background characters are a hoot, like the Ben Stiller-esque processing demon who I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve run into at the DMV before, or the painfully uncool demon Fela (short for Fellatio), whose desperation to make friends walloped me with a dose of secondhand embarrassment.\n\nAnother draw is the fact that you can choose branching quest paths that allow you to take different approaches to completing your goals. In one playthrough, I decided to help demon Fela instead of human Lynda, and Milo and Lola\u2019s Personal Demon reveled in rubbing that in their faces. The Personal Demon\u2019s recaps add a lot to Afterparty\u2019s replayability, and one character even quips about worrying about something on a second playthrough. The self-referential humour is a little heavy-handed in places, but I couldn\u2019t help chuckling.\n\nUnfortunately, here\u2019s how I know about the branching options: I initially played on an uncustomized 2019 13-inch Macbook Pro. In addition to not being able to open one of Afterparty\u2019s pause menus without it crashing, there were two separate times where I couldn\u2019t progress as a necessary dialogue option didn\u2019t show up. One case happened toward the beginning, and one happened closer to the midgame. Night School has told Kotaku it\u2019s aware of these bugs and says it\u2019s working to fix them before release. Anyway, I\u2019ll help all seven of you who are foolish enough to consider doing this like I did: Don\u2019t buy this on macOS, if you can help it.\n\nAfterparty runs much more smoothly on my PlayStation 4 Pro but still has issues. When I replicated what caused the Macbook issue on my console, I encountered some bugs that got me stuck in a dialogue or drink ordering menu. Some went away after I waited, but others, like the cocktail menu freezing, persisted until I reset the game, which was frustrating. I ultimately wasn\u2019t able to order a cocktail in the game\u2019s first bar sequence on PS4. These bugs were easier to bypass than the ones on the Macbook, but they were still disruptive.\n\nBugs notwithstanding, there\u2019s a lot to like about Afterparty if you\u2019re into games of its ilk. Like many games driven by writing, it toes the line of pretension, but it\u2019s also too self-aware and too full of dick jokes to discount for that. Admittedly, slogging through the pits of hell on foot got a little bit tedious at times, but that\u2019s a small, picky gripe. I haven\u2019t completed it yet, in part because of the bugs, but I\u2019ve greatly enjoyed what I have seen and am hoping the day-one patch will make the game more playable. I\u2019d really like to see if my horrible choices affect the endgame.
