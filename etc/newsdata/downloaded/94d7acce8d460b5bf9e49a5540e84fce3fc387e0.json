In this case, Congress \u201cexpressly declined to give him that money,\u201d and Trump signed the bill that denied him the cash for his wall.\n\nThen, Trump took the money anyway, using emergency powers that Napolitano noted may have been passed into law by previous Congresses, yet are not in the Constitution.\n\nIn a video on Fox News, Napolitano said Trump has also essentially created his own sales tax \u2015 again, a power that is supposed to belong to Congress \u2015 in the form of his tariffs on Chinese goods, likewise done in the name of a supposed emergency. He summed it up in his column:\n\n\u201cAfter years of faithless Congresses legally but unconstitutionally ceding power to the presidency, we have arrived where we are today \u2015 a president who spends unappropriated funds, raises taxes, defies courts and changes immigration laws on his own.\u201d\n\nNapolitano warned that the same Republicans who are cheering as Trump uses these unconstitutional powers \u201cwill weep over it when a Democrat is in the White House.\u201d\n\nIn his video presentation, Napolitano called it \u201cdangerous to our liberty\u201d to let the president take the powers that belong to the Congress.\n\n\u201cWhen Congress lets presidents write their own laws, then he\u2019s not a president,\u201d Napolitano said. \u201cHe\u2019s a prince.\u201d\n\nRead his full analysis here.\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
