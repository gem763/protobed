The venture is meant to challenge the growing dominance of tech giants like Google and Facebook in the news industry. (The Information)\n\nTalking point: This is the second news outlet after Ruper Murdoch\u2019s NewsCorp reported to be mulling such a launch. Neither project has been confirmed. Facebook and Apple both have news aggregators that pay publishers directly for content, and Amazon launched an aggregator app for its Fire TV and tablets on Tuesday. Publishers and tech companies have long clashed over revenue distribution, with many of the former arguing that platforms reduce their viewership and unfairly distribute ad revenue. Both CNN and NewsCorp reportedly hope to offer better deals for publishers, and attempt to avoid political bias. NewsCorp\u2019s solution to that problem will be to include hard-right publications to counter what it perceives as a leftist bias on Facebook and Google.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
