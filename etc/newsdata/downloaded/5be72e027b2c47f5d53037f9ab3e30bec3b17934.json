He will never be himself again | Sherrie Rubin", "language": "en", "text": "Dear Sackler family,\n\nYour product, OxyContin, has caused untold harm to millions of Americans.\n\nMy son, Aaron, is one of them.\n\nAaron suffered an accidental OxyContin overdose on 9 October 2005. As you are aware, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved your request to manufacture higher-dose OxyContin pills during that time. Aaron overdosed on the 160mg tablets.\n\nMy husband Michael received the call that Aaron was in an emergency room and wasn\u2019t breathing. When we arrived at the ER, the attending physician told us: \u201cYou are going to lose your son today.\u201d My husband dropped to the ground, begging God to take him, not his son. I felt numb, frozen, hot, cold and dizzy. I slid down the cold hospital wall and landed on my husband. Together we were sobbing and pleading with God, our cries echoing throughout the halls.\n\nI can still see Aaron laying on a silver hospital gurney; motionless, dressed only in his jeans, pulled down past his hips. His skin was almost colorless with a tint of blue on his feet and fingers. I thought to myself, Aaron looks extremely cold; my son needs a blanket.\n\nWell, Sackler family, I watched my son Aaron lie in the ICU unit in a vegetative state, put there by your product, OxyContin, which has ravaged all of his organs.\n\nMy son was being kept alive by machines.\n\nAdditionally, while in ICU, Aaron suffered multiple seizures, two heart attacks, staph and pneumonia. Aaron\u2019s brainstem, which enabled it to control his body temperatures, was badly damaged. As a result, Aaron\u2019s body temperature fluctuated from dangerously high heat levels to extreme Arctic degrees. Heaters and blankets or ice packs and fans filled Aaron\u2019s room, ready for either scenario. About our eighth day in the ICU, Aaron\u2019s body was on fire. Despite all efforts, his temperature would not come down.\n\nDoctors said they had one way to reduce his temperature before a massive stroke occurred. The answer? To stop his heart and then restart it. There were no guarantees Aaron\u2019s heart would restart. I couldn\u2019t breathe or watch. By the grace of God, Aaron is here with us another day.\n\nWhen we reached day 10 in the ICU, Aaron had shown no physical or mental signs of improvement. The doctors were advocating for my husband Michael and I to withdraw care from our son, taking him off life support machines.\n\nMy husband and I now faced a decision one could never prepare for: whether or not to end our son\u2019s life.\n\nIt\u2019s moments like this in life that define us: who we are, who we become, sometimes unknowingly designing our futures.\n\nAaron\u2019s doctors and neurologists all concluded Aaron would never regain consciousness, and he\u2019d remain in a vegetative state.\n\nI refused to give up on my son. Ten days was their magic number, not mine.\n\nAaron finally did open his eyes. They were not the gorgeous blue eyes I had recognized for 23 years, but they were open.\n\nAaron survived the devastation OxyContin wreaked on his body, but only just. Today he is a quadriplegic who cannot speak anymore and needs 24-hour care.\n\nSackler family, you\u2019re insatiable greed has filled cemeteries across America. But our son Aaron is not buried in a graveyard. He is buried above ground, trapped in his own body, fighting desperately to regain pieces of himself that opioid-induced darkness took from him.\n\nWhere are the pieces of my son taken by OxyContin?\n\nThe truth is, they can never be returned.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSherrie Rubin", "description": "Aaron suffered an accidental OxyContin overdose in 2005, and today he is a quadriplegic who cannot speak", "authors": ["Sherrie Rubin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0ace16fd3ff5dab063ece74f58c18eeae797339/0_170_5120_3074/master/5120.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7ff090062f112707878d4832328aebbe", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
