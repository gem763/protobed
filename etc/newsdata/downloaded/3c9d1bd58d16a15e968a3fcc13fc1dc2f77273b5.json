The rolls are stickier, gooier, denser and more intense than their peers.\n\nAs with any adored, mass-produced food product, there are many copy-cat recipes floating around the web, and I\u2019m not going to write a whole new recipe when there are plenty of serviceable ones out there. (My favourite is this one by Stella Parks.) The truth is, any cinnamon roll recipe can be tweaked to make more Cinnabon-esque \u2014 i.e., better \u2014 you just have to do three little things.\n\nDouble the icing\n\nThis is not a time for restraint. We\u2019re not making delicate French pastries or even fussy English tea cakes, we\u2019re making large American chonkers born in the chaos of a mall food court. Are Cinnabon\u2019s rolls drizzled with icing? Nay, they are drowned. So whatever amount of icing your recipe calls for, make double. The \u201cworst\u201d thing that could happen is you have \u201ctoo much\u201d icing. Somehow, I think you\u2019ll manage.\n\nGet fancy cinnamon\n\nYou have probably been in some kind of strip mall or shopping centre. When you were in said mall, an intoxicating mixture of cinnamon, sugar, butter and yeast probably floated by your nose, captivating your senses and watering your mouth. While it\u2019s true that any sugary cinnamon roll might elicit a similar response, Cinnabon uses a very particular trademarked, proprietary blend of cinnamon, which they call \u201cMakara cinnamon.\u201d\n\nYou can buy their special blend of cinnamon in a little branded jar, or you could buy Korintjie cinnamon\u2014the cinnamon that won the initial \u201cwhich cinnamon are we going to use in our buns?\u201d contest many years ago. It\u2019s a more pungent, more volatile bark, and it makes for a more fragrant, seductive roll.\n\nUndercook the jerks\n\nNo one has ever taken a bite of a cinnamon roll, sighed, then said \u201cI wish this were drier.\u201d The best cinnamon rolls are soft and doughy in the centre, with a lightly browned, barely golden crust that offers just the tiniest bit of resistance before giving way to a gooey, pillowy, sticky centre. To achieve this ideal texture, you need to undercook yours by 10-15 degrees.\n\nCinnabon cooks theirs to a very low 74 degrees Celsius, but that is a temperature that is specific to their dough, and might be too low for yours, depending on the ingredients. When I tried to cook Parks\u2019 rolls to that temperature, they came out off-puttingly raw, rather than pleasantly doughy.\n\nBut when I cooked the rolls 10 degrees short of the prescribed end point (90 degrees Celsius instead of 100), they were absolutely perfect. There was no \u201ccrust\u201d per se, just a slightly golden barrier of heat-kissed dough to give the roll a bit of structure. Inside, a world of gooey, cinnamon drenched wonderment awaited. It was like being in the food court all over again, except with no competing food court smells, and no teens. I would never let a teen into my kitchen.", "description": "Cinnabon technically makes cinnamon rolls, but the product they put out is almost in a category all by itself.
