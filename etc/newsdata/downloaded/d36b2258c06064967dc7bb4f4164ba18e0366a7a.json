REUTERS/Tom Nicholson\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party will try to amend legislation to ratify Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, the party\u2019s finance spokesman John McDonnell said on Sunday.\n\nJohnson has said he will bring forward the legislation in parliament next week after parliament voted on Saturday to withhold approval of the agreement until formal ratification legislation has passed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be moving amendments and see whether or not we can get some form of agreement through the House of Commons that\u2019s then acceptable,\u201d McDonnell told Sky News, citing issues Labour wants to see included such as protection of workers\u2019 rights.\n\nHe also said the issue of a second Brexit referendum would \u201calmost inevitably come up\u201d, but that any amendment proposing one would be more widely accepted by lawmakers from other parties if it did not come from Labour\u2019s leadership team.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always said actually let the people decide,\u201d he said.\n\nMcDonnell said Johnson\u2019s decision to send an unsigned letter to the EU requesting a delay to Brexit as well as another note in which he explained that he did not want a \u201cdeeply corrosive\u201d extension could put him in contempt of court.\n\nJohnson was compelled to write the letter by a law passed last month by opponents and his government made undertakings to a Scottish court that it would not seek to frustrate the legislation.\n\n\u201cHe may well be in contempt of parliament or the courts themselves because he\u2019s clearly trying to undermine the first letter,\u201d McDonnell said.\n\n\u201cAnd not signing the letter, he\u2019s behaving a bit like a spoiled brat, parliament made a decision, he should abide by it.\u201d", "description": "Britain's opposition Labour Party will try to amend legislation to ratify Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, the party's finance spokesman John McDonnell said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442940447&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J06L", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
