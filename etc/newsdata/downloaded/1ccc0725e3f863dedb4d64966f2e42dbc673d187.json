Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\n\u201cNo, no, I didn't,\u201d Trump said at the United Nations when reporters asked if he told the president of Ukraine that they would only get military aid if they investigated Biden during photo-op with Poland's president.\n\n\u201cI put no pressure on them, whatsoever,\u201d Trump said of his call. \u201cI could have, I think it would have probably possibly have been okay if I did, but I didn't I didn't put any pressure on them whatsoever. You know why? Because they want to do the right thing and they know about corruption, and they probably know that Joe Biden and his son are corrupt,\" repeating,\"They probably know that Joe Biden and his son are corrupt. Joe Biden and his son are corrupt.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nHe told reporters he is indeed considering releasing the transcript of his call with president of Ukraine in order to set the record straight, even as he said he doesn\u2019t like the precedent it would sets to do so.\n\n\u201cNow, when you see the call, if you see it, I hope you see it frankly, you will find out that I did not do that at all. And you'll be very disappointed when you say it, it's really a disgrace,\u201d Trump said, blasting the media \u2013 saying some of the press are \u201ccrooked.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do it very easily,\u201d he said of declassifying the call. \u201cBut I'd rather not do it from the standpoint of all of the other conversations I have, I may do it because it was a very innocent call,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't think it's a great precedent to be releasing calls with foreign countries heads a foreign country so I don't think it's a great precedent.\u201d\n\nThe president insisted repeatedly that there was nothing wrong with his call, even as he defended the notion that it would be proper for Ukraine to root out any corruption. \u201cI did not make a statement that you have to do this or I'm not going to give you. I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWith that being said, what I want is I want you know we're giving a lot of money away to Ukraine, and other places. You want to see a country that's going to be not corrupt,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cWhen Biden does a thing like that, that\u2019s still corrupt, and that\u2019s not good,\u201d he continued.\n\nPeter Foley/EPA via Shutterstock\n\nEarlier Monday, the president said he\u2019s taking new Democratic pressure for his impeachment \u201cnot at all seriously,\" accusing them of latching onto the call as just the latest chapter in a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him.\n\n\u201cWe had a perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine,\u201d he said as he arrived at the UN for a week of meetings, including one scheduled with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cIt\u2019s just a Democrat witch hunt, here we go again. They failed with Russia, that failed with recession, they failed with everything, and now they\u2019re bringing this up.\u201d\n\nThe president's comments come after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote a letter Sunday to her Democratic colleagues in which she issued an ultimatum for the administration to release the whistleblower's report to Congress, warning that if the administration does not cooperate, \"they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\"\n\nThe president\u2019s call with the newly-elected president of Ukraine over the summer has come under scrutiny in recent days after it was reported that an individual within the intelligence community filed a formal whistleblower complaint over concerns about the call.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has reported that Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings of Democratic presidential rival and former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, bringing it up during the course of the phone call about eight times.\n\nThe president sought to direct the attention at Vice President Biden, saying \u201cwhat Biden did was wrong.\"\n\n\u201cThe one who\u2019s got the problem is Biden. If you look at what Biden did, Biden did what would they would like to have me to, except there\u2019s one problem, I didn\u2019t do it. What Biden did is a disgrace, what his son did is a disgrace,\u201d Trump said.\n\nVice President Biden has denied anything inappropriate.\n\nThe president has stopped short of confirming what he told the president of Ukraine but has seemed to acknowledge that he did bring up the topic of the former vice president with the Ukrainian leader.\n\nThe president defended that corruption is an important topic to discuss with a world leader of a country to which the U.S. is providing support.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supporting a country, we want to make sure a country is honest, it\u2019s very important to talk about corruption. If you don\u2019t talk about corruption why would you give money?\u201d\n\nAt the time of the call, the Trump administration had been holding back $250 million in congressionally-approved aid to Ukraine.\n\nShortly after his remarks, the president took to Twitter to question whether the whistleblower is even \u201con our country\u2019s side\u201d and asks \u201cwhere does he come from\u201d \u2013 the president apparently assuming that the whistleblower is a man although he's said he doesn't know who it is.", "description": "President Trump said Monday that he was", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/donald-trump-UN-03-ss-jc-190923_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
