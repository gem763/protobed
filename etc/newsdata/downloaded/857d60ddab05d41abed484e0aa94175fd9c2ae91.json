Money follows popularity in political campaigns, not vice versa.\n\nMaybe Harris is running the ol\u2019 Giuliani 2008 strategy of skipping all of the early states and focusing entirely on Florida.\n\nWhen Harris returns to Iowa this weekend for the Polk County Democrats\u2019 Steak Fry, it\u2019ll be her first trip to the state in over a month. She\u2019s visited just 18 of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties so far. It\u2019s been more than two months since her last visit to South Carolina, where Harris, who is African American, is counting on a robust showing among black voters who make up the majority of the state\u2019s Democratic primary voters. And Harris has been in New Hampshire just once in the last two months.\n\nOld Man Biden\u2019s made seven trips to the early states in the past six weeks or so and has already visited more counties in Iowa than she has despite having entered the race much later. Someone drag Officer Harris out of the donut shop and tell her to get back on the beat.\n\nOr don\u2019t. It\u2019s already too late. Let her enjoy her cruller.\n\nKamala Harris\u2019 support is plunging in Iowa, where she\u2019s seen a 13-point drop since July, according to a new poll. Notably, the survey, commissioned by Focus on Rural America and taken after the third presidential debate in Houston, was conducted by Harris\u2019 chief pollster, David Binder\u2026 The new survey, conducted Sept. 14-17, shows Harris sliding into sixth place at 5 percent, with Biden at 25 percent retaking the lead he lost over the summer. Harris recently embarked on a statewide bus tour and was the first in the field to run ads in Iowa. The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBetween this and yesterday\u2019s NBC survey, there\u2019s a distinct \u201cScott Walker 2016\u201d stench coming off of her right now. But I think she\u2019ll soldier on, believing that she could rocket into the top tier again at any moment if Biden has a lethal rhetorical stumble of some sort and black voters in South Carolina are suddenly in play.\n\nIf nothing else, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how she uses her time at the next few debates. Her only big moment of the race to date came at Biden\u2019s expense at the first one but trying to reprise that would be perilous for her. Realistically, Harris should be playing for a VP spot at this point, and realistically, the only type of nominee whom she\u2019d \u201cbalance\u201d demographically on the ticket is a white male, i.e. Bernie Sanders or Biden himself. The obvious strategy for her now is to go easy on Joe to ingratiate herself to him and maybe even start carrying his water by trying to damage Elizabeth Warren on his behalf. That\u2019s risky too, though, since Warren is probably the \u201ctrue\u201d frontrunner \u2014 she outpolls Biden when Dem voters\u2019 first and second choices are combined, she\u2019s the only candidate in the race drawing very enthusiastic crowds, and the overwhelmingly white electorates in Iowa and New Hampshire play to her demographic strengths. Harris won\u2019t be VP to Warren (I think?) since Democrats would worry how an all-woman ticket would be received, but Attorney General in a Warren administration, God help us, seems feasible.\n\nAs long as she doesn\u2019t hit Warren too hard on the stump this fall, that is. So what does Harris do?\n\nAnyway, she\u2019s leaving the donut shop soon:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m f****** moving to Iowa,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris joked to Sen.
