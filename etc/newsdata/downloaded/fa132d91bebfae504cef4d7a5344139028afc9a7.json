I thought we were the County Durham Von Traps. I thought we already spent loads of time together but being there\u2019s made me realise, actually we don\u2019t and we could spend loads more time together.\n\n\u2018We went there in May and we\u2019re still having more meals together.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m just careless.
