The price of fuel has since more than doubled.\n\nEcuador's army took to the streets after Moreno ordered the first 24-hour curfew in decades. It was the first such action imposed since a series of coups in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nBy Saturday night, soldiers had retaken control of the park and streets leading to the National Assembly and the national comptroller's office, which had been broken into by protesters who started fires inside the building.", "description": "After days of deadly anti-austerity protests, meeting between President Moreno and indigenous leaders likely on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/13/bc8ed6acef5947e19c07f957f80d92f5_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
