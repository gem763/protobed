Biden said in a new interview that his children won\u2019t have offices in the White House or sit in on Cabinet meetings if he\u2019s elected president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just simply improper because you should make it clear to the American public that everything you\u2019re doing is for them,\u201d Mr. Biden said in an interview to air Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the idea that you\u2019re going to \u2026 go to the extent that he has gone to have our, you know his children, his son-in-law, et cetera, engaged in the day-to-day operation of things they know nothing about,\u201d he said.\n\nIvanka Trump, President Trump\u2019s daughter, and her husband Jared Kushner both have jobs at the White House.\n\nAsked if Mr. Trump\u2019s children have acted properly and avoided conflicts of interest, Mr. Biden said: \u201cLook, I wasn\u2019t raised to go after the children. Their actions speak for themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can just tell you this, that if I\u2019m president, get elected president, my children are not going to have offices in the White House. My children are not going to sit in on Cabinet meetings,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said with a laugh that he doesn\u2019t think Mr. Kushner should be trying to broker a Middle East peace deal.\n\n\u201cWhat credential does he bring to that?\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, look, think of all the really solid people that \u2026 started off in that administration. They\u2019ve all left. They\u2019ve all left. All the talent is gone.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden has fended off his own conflict of interest questions in recent weeks, amid questions over his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and China while the elder Biden was vice president.\n\nBrad Parscale, Mr. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign manager, said Mr. Biden is correct that Hunter Biden would never have an office in the White House \u201cbecause he\u2019s proven that his only qualification is being the son of Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nMr. Parscale praised Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump for their work on issues such as criminal justice reform, trade and taxes.\n\n\u201cIvanka Trump, in her own right, has proven herself to be an accomplished CEO and has made historic strides for women,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
