Dozens of big name models burst from a double doorway at one end of the historic Park Avenue Armory building\u2019s 55,000-square-foot Drill Hall, one of the largest unobstructed spaces in the city.\n\nBy the time they reached the audience at the other end of the room they had fanned out like multi-coloured particles, expanding to the tune of Dream a Little Dream. Models including Alek Wek, Adut Akech and Gigi Hadid weaved their way between the audience - that included the actor Zendaya and director Sofia Coppola \u2013 seated on a smorgasbord of stools, benches and rocking chairs.\n\nFor his spring/summer 2020 collection, Jacobs was in a reflective mood. His 2001 show had taken place the night before 9/11. \u201cIt has been 18 years and a day we will never forget,\u201d he said. The after party had been held on the Hudson, against a skyline that would be irrevocably changed within hours.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Marc Jacobs collection was high-fashion meets Miss Hannibal Photograph: Mary Altaffer/AP\n\nThe 2001 show can be \u201cseen in context as a tragically dazzling snapshot of life in New York before the world changed the next morning,\u201d said a Paper Magazine article quoted in this show\u2019s notes. At the time, many fashion journalists in town for the shows diverted to reporting on the attacks.\n\nBut this show, like the one of 2001, was a \u201ccelebration of life.\u201d It was an exploration of iconic images, from \u201cthe genius of Karl [Lagerfeld]\u201d to the \u201ctimeless style of Lee Radziwill\u201d.\n\nThe clothes were high-fashion meets Annie\u2019s Miss Hannigan, dressing up box chic that made for a maximalist whole and veering from 60s shifts to an 80s-style pinstripe powersuit to a Stetson. The American designer and former Louise Vuitton creative director\u2019s recent preoccupation with volume was lived out in extravagantly proportioned dresses in Kermit-green and hot-pink.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The designer\u2019s preoccupation with volume was lived out in extravagantly proportioned dresses Photograph: Peter White/FilmMagic\n\nA 70s thread, which echoed the \u201cflower child\u201d direction of Jacobs\u2019 2001 show, saw model Kaia Gerber dressed in a floor-length, statement sleeved dress decorated with florals enough to rival a Kew greenhouse. There was a pair of patchwork denim flares, wide-legged jumpsuits and a blouse with sharp, statement collars. Jacobs took his end-of-show bow, the signal that New York fashion week is over for another season, wearing glam-rock-high red platform boots. The inspiration of \u201cthe effortless coolness of Anita Pallenberg\u201d, an icon of so-called boho-chic, was present in the collection\u2019s wide-brimmed floppy hats, feathers and long, flowing dresses.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The show had a 70s thread Photograph: WWD/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe colour palette didn\u2019t discriminate - deep burgundy velvet trousers were teamed with a post box red jacket and there was a hat and jacket combination in Ikea-blue and yellow.\n\nThe big-name makeup artist Pat McGrath, along with a team that included Jin Soon Choi and Mei Kawajiri, had been tasked with creating individual beauty looks - from metallic eyeshadows and voluminous eyelashes - for the models.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A model on the catwalk at the Marc Jacobs show Photograph: WWD/REX/Shutterstock\n\nIn recent years there has been a lot of speculation about the future of the brand, with rumours of decline and possible closure.\n\nEarlier this year the designer announced a new venture, The Marc Jacobs. This more affordable offshoot of the brand comes four years after the closure of his previous more accessible line, Marc by Marc Jacobs.\n\nThere have also been controversies swirling around some of Jacobs\u2019 designs. In 2016 he was widely criticised for a show in which largely white models were styled with multi-coloured dreadlocks, later admitting \u201cmaybe I\u2019ve been insensitive.\u201d More recently the designer, considered by many to have popularised the grunge look within the fashion industry, was accused by the estate of the band Nirvana of copyright infringement - the designer\u2019s Redux Grunge collection featured a \u201csmiley face\u201d similar to the one used by Nirvana as their logo. Jacobs\u2019 lawyers filed for a dismissal of the case.", "description": "In \u2018celebration of life\u2019, famed designer looks back on his 2001 show, which took place the night before 9/11", "authors": ["Ellie Violet Bramley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1f83e4fdcc7fce5ca764b7b18842b3ece684aed/0_74_4107_2464/master/4107.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=558912044046fa3d34bfa00185d2a0fb", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
