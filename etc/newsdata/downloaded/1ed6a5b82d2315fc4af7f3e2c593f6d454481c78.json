He said it would be a \"a barrier against free trade and would have a negative impact on not only the US airlines but also US jobs, suppliers, and air travellers\".\n\nAirbus said close to 40% of Airbus' aircraft-related procurement comes from US aerospace suppliers, which it said it supports 275,000 American jobs in 40 states.", "description": "The World Trade Organization has issued its latest ruling in the 15-year dispute over Airbus subsidies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DC43/production/_101578365_gettyimages-800537608-1.jpg"}
