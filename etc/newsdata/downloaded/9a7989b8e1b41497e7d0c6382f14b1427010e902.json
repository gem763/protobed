In fact, fans felt that Ben's way too controlling and \"expects' a lot of things from Akinyi.\n\nHis five-year-old son Grayson's very cute, and Ben said that he's hardly ever been away from his son. When he told his son he was going to Kenya, the cute little guy wanted to go along as well.\n\nBut, he never told Grayson about Akinyi, in case it never worked out. That seemed like a good idea to \"90 Day Fiance\" fans at the time. But Ben grew worried that Akinyi wouldn't take to being a mom. In fact, he noted it \"would be a deal-breaker.\"\n\nAkinyi Obala mentioned on IG about her fears of being a stepmom\n\nAkinyi took to her IG to ask about being a stepmom, and she put forward her fears to her friends and fans.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

Some fans wondered why she said she'd rather be a \"friend\" to the child. And, she explained that. The \"90 Day Fiance\" star said, \"I wanted to be friends first with his son because no relationship on this earth ends up good without starting from something as basic as friendship.\"\n\nAkinyi also noted that she could not think of assuming \"mom duties without forming some sort of bond with a child.\" To her, starting out as a friend seemed like a \"reasonable bond.\" Nevertheless, she knows little about parenting and asked her followers for advice - especially from those who had been through step-parenting.\n\nWell, it emerges now, that Ben's ex certainly experienced this type of thing in her life, and now, her ideas on it emerged this week via 187anonymousgossip on Instagram.\n\nBen on '90 Day Fiance' has an ex who gave her views on the stepmom\n\nThe mom and ex of Ben weighed in with her views on Akinyi becoming a stepmom and wanting to first be a friend. On her Instagram, she's got some lovely shots of their son as well.\n\nIn her post about it, that only emerged this week, she said, \"No one just becomes a step parent. By marriage technically yes you are a step parent if your spouse has a child from a previous relationship. But by NO MEANS does that mean you have that level of a relationship with that child from day one.\"\n\nActually, it looks like Akinyi's spot on with wanting to be a friend to Ben's son first. Obviously keeping track of '90 Day Fiance,\" it seems Ben's ex agrees with Akinyi's approach.\n\nShe added, \"When my current partner met my son, he met him as a friend. He got to know him and grow to understand what he meant to him. My son is smart and he told ME that my partner was his step dad...I'm deeply concerned when someone pushes a person into a role they are not prepared for mentally. If he wants this relationship to work he will let her guide that pace. Let her get acclimated with a new country and life before shoving the role of stepmom on her. Just my 5 cents.\"\n\nWhat do you think about Ben's ex agreeing with Akinyi that she should rather become a friend to his son first? It certainly sounds like she agrees that Ben's trying to get a bit too controlling with Akinyi by trying to force her into a stepmom role too fast.\n\nRemember to follow the Reality TV Channel on Blasting News for more news about \"90 Day Fiance.\"", "description": "Ben seems quite adamant that Akinyi should immediately become a stepmom to his son, but she's reluctant.
