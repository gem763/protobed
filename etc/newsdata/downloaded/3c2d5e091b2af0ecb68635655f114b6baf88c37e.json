Some feel that Twitch\u2019s policies over sexual content unfairly target women, especially women whose bodies are curvier. Twitch streamer ExohydraX, who received an indefinite ban from the platform last week over her attire, is now among that number. In a conversation with Kotaku, she discussed what she feels are inconsistently applied policies when it comes to what women are allowed to wear.\n\nExoHydraX started playing Call of Duty on YouTube five years ago, and in the past year, she started streaming on that platform as well. She told Kotaku over email that she had decided to try out Twitch by doing streams in the more casual \u201cJust Chatting\u201d subsection. Like a lot of streamers in that category, she talks to her followers and does dances while wearing form-fitting clothing. That all came to a screeching halt late last week when her channel was indefinitely banned from Twitch.\n\nIn a YouTube stream about her ban, ExoHydraX said that she had been temporarily banned twice before, once for drinking on stream and once for her cleavage. This third ban came on the heels of a stream in which ExoHydraX said she was being targeted by racist trolls who were hurling slurs at her for being a French person of North African descent.\n\n\u201cI feel like they won.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it became clear that people were mass reporting me and trolling me in the last stream because I had dozens of French people spamming extremely hateful stuff as well as racist things at me,\u201d she told Kotaku over email. (Twitch did not immediately respond to Kotaku\u2019s request for comment.) ExoHydraX said that the presence of people saying racist things in her Twitch chat caused her to become frustrated and angry, which in turn invited more trolls.\n\nAs she has a smaller channel with just around 4,600 followers, she doesn\u2019t have a dedicated mod team to help her police her chat. Her most successful stream \u2014 notably, the one where she was brigaded \u2014 peaked at around 750 viewers. A few days later, she woke up to an email from Twitch saying that her channel was banned indefinitely because it contained \u201csexually suggestive content\u201d. She believes her small channel only got banned because she was brigaded by people who then mass-reported her.\n\n\u201cTo think that someone could be so fucking mean and they could get away with it, that fucking kills me,\u201d she said in her YouTube video about the ban. \u201cThese people were saying terrible shit, and they mass-reported me\u2026 I don\u2019t want to fucking cry but, it\u2019s not even me getting banned, it\u2019s not even just that, it\u2019s that these were the people who reported me and I feel like they won.\u201d After saying this, ExoHydraX left the room for a moment to collect herself before returning to the stream to discuss her ban further.\n\nExoHydraX told Kotaku that she has appealed her ban and is willing to \u201crebrand\u201d herself and cover up more. She\u2019s hopeful about her channel being reinstated but also said that given the volume of people on Twitch and the limited staff, it might take a while.\n\nShe pointed to the streamer Velvet_7, who also danced on Twitch while wearing clothing that showed her cleavage, as an example of a streamer who was banned and then regained her channel. What bothers ExoHydraX is not only that this ban came as a result of targeted harassment, but also that she finds Twitch\u2019s policies on sexually suggestive content to be unclear.\n\n\u201cI also think it does depend on who\u2019s wearing the clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say that they want streamers to wear outfits to be mall friendly, in which case I am comfortable wearing cleavage and a romper at the mall,\u201d she said over email. \u201cBut then I get banned for wearing cleavage and a romper, so... how does this work?\u201d\n\nExoHydraX is a curvy woman, and is therefore subject to unfair standards and stereotypes. Clothing that might read as non-sexual on a woman who is less curvy is perceived differently when it\u2019s on her.\n\n\u201cI also think it does depend on who\u2019s wearing [the clothes.] Two girls with two completely different bodies but with the same shirt would get treated completely different,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Twitch needs to come out with new guidelines in terms of dress codes. What is acceptable and on whom is it acceptable? It\u2019s a difficult discussion, but it is necessary for smaller streamers.\u201d\n\nAs a busty woman who is quite aware that clothing looks different on my body than it does on women with smaller breasts, situations like these are frustrating. Barring a breast reduction, there\u2019s nothing I can do to make my body look \u201cappropriate\u201d according to these types of standards.\n\nIt\u2019s not a new issue, either. When I was a teenager, school dress codes and even my parents would prevent me from wearing clothing that I saw my peers wearing all the time, because when I wore it, it was suddenly perceived as obscene.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about tube tops or halter tops; I\u2019m talking about button-up shirts, fitted T-shirts, and even some sleeveless shirts that were off-limits to me because they read as more sexual on my body. Even as an adult, I wear almost exclusively men\u2019s T-shirts to de-emphasise my bust.\n\nAgain, ExoHydraX said that she is very willing to cover up to get back on Twitch if they do decide to reinstate her channel. During her YouTube stream, she goes through some recent clothing she bought, humorously pointing out which pieces would probably get her banned on Twitch again and discussing the way that she\u2019d cover up her cleavage if she returned to the platform. According to her, Twitch is where the action is, and without having access to the platform, her streaming career is dead in the water.\n\nIn a stream archive, ExoHydraX read this question from a viewer: \u201cWhy are you trying to go back on Twitch with all that BS?\u201d by saying the following: \u201cBecause Twitch is a great platform, apart from this. It\u2019s pretty much where everyone is at. If everyone was at Mixer, I would go to Mixer.\u201d", "description": "For women streaming on Twitch, being questionably banned for \u201csuggestive\u201d clothing or behaviour is an increasingly visible problem.
