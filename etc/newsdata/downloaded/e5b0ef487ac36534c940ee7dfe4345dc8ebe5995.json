I was listening to the weather forecast on the radio and it said it was going to be pleasant and quite dry.\n\n\"I could hear water and I went to the window and looked out and there was a river.\n\n\"I rang my flatmate and she was shocked that was the scene.\n\n\"I can see people using buckets trying to throw the water out their homes. Firefighters keep walking past and a few people are in their wellies walking up and down the road and exploring.\n\n\"Other people are stood by their windows looking out at what's happened.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe travel industry worker continued: \"I'm trapped, I've missed work, which is infuriating when you're starting a new job.\n\n\"I feel really sorry for the people in the basements and lower floors as I can see them trying to pour out the water.\"\n\nSome have described the water as \"knee-deep\" while in other parts it is \"ankle-deep\".\n\nResident Steve Stubbs knew something was amiss when he went to get a drink and there was no water.\n\n\"Then I checked Twitter and saw one tweet about a flood on Queens Drive,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought... oh that's where we are. I opened the balcony door and saw this river flowing down the road.\n\n\"The school looks OK as it's on slightly higher ground, but residents around the area on ground doors are having issues I think.\n\n\"We are dry up on the fourth floor.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nKarim Traboulsi was woken up by the noise and initially thought something was wrong with his heating, or that it was raining heavily over the roof.\n\nHe said: \"Then I peeked out the window and saw the flooding. My first thought was: I probably won't be able to make it to work.\n\n\"Now we're a bit worried about our elderly neighbour in the basement flat.\n\n\"[Water] isn't yet coming through, but it's leaking into the front garden, but hasn't made it to the stairs or the building foundations. The water level is not rising as far as I can tell, but it's still flowing very quick.\n\n\"Firefighters are on the street talking to anyone who ventures out. They haven't come in to talk to everyone in the building.\n\n(Image: @heisenben/Twitter)\n\n(Image: @heisenben/Twitter)\n\n\"I've seen some people trying to brace the water but it seems the fire department personnel are advising them against it but not stopping them per se.\"\n\nOne person tweeted: \"Woken up to find our flat now has a river view.\"\n\nA second added: \"The street and my neighbours' flats are under water.\"\n\nFootage taken of Queens Drive shows fast-moving water flowing down the street, with cars still parked on the road.\n\nA Thames Water spokesman said: \"We're sorry to any customers affected by our burst main this morning.\n\n(Image: @heisenben/Twitter)\n\n\"We\u2019ve sent our specialist engineers to the scene as a top priority, and they will be working hard to get everything back to normal as soon as possible.\"\n\nA spokesman for London Fire Brigade said: \"Twelve fire engines and around 80 firefighters, as well other specialist vehicles, are at the scene of a burst water main at the junction of Queens Drive and Princess Crescent, Finsbury Park.\n\n\"An area measuring around 600 x 200 metres has been flooded to a depth of around one metre. Firefighters are evacuating residents from affected properties. Queens Drive and Brownswood Road are currently closed to traffic.\n\n\"The Brigade was called at 0747.\n\n\"Fire crews from Holloway, Stoke Newington, Islington, Kentish Town and Tottenham fire stations are at the scene.\"", "description": "Eighty firefighters are at the scene of the burst water main in Hackney and Finsbury Park, London, that has left some residents trapped in their own homes", "authors": ["Amber Hicks", "Image", "Pa", "Heisenben Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20534889.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Finsbury-Park.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
