We have not set a deadline regarding its finalisation.\"\n\nThe pupil's lawyer did not want to comment.", "description": "The SA Council of Educators has launched its own investigation into the scandal at Bishops where a former teacher stands accused of having a relationship with a pupil.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2869/dd3bbf6fffd74bf9b811181260591bb3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
