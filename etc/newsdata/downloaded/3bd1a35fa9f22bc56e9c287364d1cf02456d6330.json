REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/Files\n\nH&M has been spending heavily on reviving its business in the face of years of falling profits and growing inventories due to slowing sales at its core brand\u2019s stores amid tougher competition and changing shopping habits.\n\nIts shares have spiked 46% this year, and 58% from the 13-year low seen in 2018, on hopes it is getting back on track. But they are still at just half of their 2015 record level.\n\nPretax profit in the June through August period beat expectations, growing to 5.0 billion crowns ($507 million) from a year-ago 4.01 billion. Analysts had on average forecast a rise to 4.93 billion crowns, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nThe increase was the Swedish group\u2019s first since the second quarter of 2017. Profit growth was helped by accelerating sales growth on the back of strong demand for summer collections and market share gains.\n\n\u201cThe continued development of more full-price sales and reduced markdowns contributed to a 26% increase in operating profit in the third quarter, all while maintaining a high level of activity in our transformation work,\u201d CEO Karl-Johan Persson said in a statement.\n\nThe operating profit margin rose to 8.0% from 7.1%.\n\nInventories increased 9% to 42.0 billion crowns at the end of the third quarter, equivalent to 18.5% of sales. However, H&M said that measured in local currencies, they shrank by 1% while the composition of the stock had kept improving.\n\nMarkdowns decreased for a fourth straight quarter, by 2 percentage point in relation to sales. H&M had in June predicted a 1.5 percentage point decrease. The company broke habit by not providing an outlook for markdowns in the current quarter.\n\nH&M said sales in September, the first month of its fourth quarter, grew 8% in local currencies.\n\n($1 = 9.8736 Swedish crowns)", "description": "H&M , the world's second-biggest fashion retailer, reported on Thursday its first quarterly rise in pretax profit in over two years and said efforts to meet rapid changes in its industry were on track.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436529759&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920BB"}
