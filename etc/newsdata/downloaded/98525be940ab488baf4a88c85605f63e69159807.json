Well, it's taken longer because we want to ensure that when we submit, it's everything that we can envision that HRM senior staff is going to require,\" he said.\n\nAnthony LeBlanc is a partner with Schooners Sports and Entertainment, the group trying to land the CFL franchise. (Robert Short/CBC)\n\nHe said the schedules accompanying the main proposal are the work of third-party experts recruited by the business group and Canada Lands Company, which controls the land where the business group has said it would like to build a $130-million stadium.\n\nThey include a real estate market and stadium impact analysis, planning assumptions and site plan revisions, along with a list of prospective community events for the stadium.\n\nThere are also letters of support from outside organizations, a revised master plan from Canada Lands, infrastructure designs, a traffic-impact study, and a survey of stadium financing plans in the U.S. and Canada from a public-private partnership perspective.\n\nLeBlanc said a previous economic impact analysis that was commissioned from Deloitte in May 2018 was also included.\n\nHe said it would be left up to the municipality to release any details in the documents.\n\nProponents of the CFL franchise want to see a stadium built on Shannon Park, near the MacKay Bridge. (CBC)\n\nMeanwhile, LeBlanc confirmed the business group is formally trying to get approval for a stadium in Shannon Park, which sits on land on the Dartmouth side of Halifax Harbour near the MacKay Bridge.\n\n\"I know that there will be some questions that come up and there will be evolution over the next months and even years as we move forward,\" LeBlanc said.\n\nHe said he wants people in Halifax to know Schooners Sports and Entertainment is serious in its intent.\n\n\"Obviously there are going to be people who are against it, and all we ask is that they look at the information with an open mind.\"\n\nHalifax Mayor Mike Savage said in an interview last week that a final decision by regional council is not imminent.\n\nSavage said once submitted, the business plan would be studied by city planning staff before it would go to council for consideration.\n\nMORE TOP STORIES", "description": "A 'voluminous' package was delivered to the municipality's CAO after business hours Friday, says proponent Anthony LeBlanc.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5008393.1549482792!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/halifax-cfl-stadium-20181026.jpg"}
