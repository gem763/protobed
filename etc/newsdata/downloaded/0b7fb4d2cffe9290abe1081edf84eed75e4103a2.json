It is facing demands for greater Kurdish autonomy from the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), an armed opposition group.\n\nThere have also been frequent clashes in the area between Iranian security forces and Iranian Kurdish militant groups based in neighbouring Iraq, such as the Party of Free Life of Kurdistan (PJAK), accused by Tehran of having links to Kurdish PKK insurgents in Turkey.", "description": "Iran's President Hassan Rouhani called on Turkey on Wednesday to show restraint and avoid military action in northern Syria, as Ankara's forces were poised to advance into an area there being vacated by the U.S. military.", "authors": ["Tuqa Khalid", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
