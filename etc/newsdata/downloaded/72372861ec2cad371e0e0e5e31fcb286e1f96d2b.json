Courtesy of Barclays\n\n\"Disguised as a flower pot, the omnipresent detection system can observe bodily movements and functions, such as heart rate, gait, and ultimately the progression of certain diseases, to help prevent negative outcomes that may be costly or worst, fatal,\" Barclays analysts wrote in a note following the event.\n\nAnalysts at Jefferies provided a similar picture of the flower pots and their purpose:\n\n\"Walmart is incorporating flower pots with three different sensors near store entrances to capture/measure customer vitals/one's gait for additional analysis,\" Jefferies analysts wrote.\n\nBut according to a source familiar with the device, the plan is to use the device in the home rather than in stores.\n\nIt's in line with what other companies have been exploring: using technology in the home to monitor the health of patients.\n\nBest Buy and Amazon are bringing healthcare tech into homes\n\nFor instance, Best Buy has been investing in companies that make technology for seniors, including wearables, while Amazon's Alexa assistant made the leap into healthcare skills, including helping patients schedule appointments and track blood sugar levels.\n\n\"This management team doesn't do things loosely and lightly,\" Karen Short, the analyst at Barclays told Business Insider.\n\nAfter testing and finding the optimal way to go about something \u2014 whether that's the clinics or this device \u2014 the Walmart team goes for it, she said.

Ahead of the grand opening, the prototype had a hole in the top, which got filled with flowers, the person said.\n\n\"The flower pot's ambient sensors can pick up health conditions, which could be revolutionary for a growing elderly population and other at-risk demographics with predispositions for certain conditions, or simply those who live alone,\" Short wrote in the note.\n\nIdeally, the flower pots could be sold and used at home to monitor people's health, Barclays wrote in its note.", "description": "Analysts from Jefferies and Barclays were quick to point out a sensor-enabled flower pot present at Walmart's new health clinic.", "authors": ["Lydia Ramsey"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8cfc6e2e22af66df190518?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
