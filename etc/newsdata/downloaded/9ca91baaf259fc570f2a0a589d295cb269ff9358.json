That means it rises by inflation, 2.5% or average earnings - whichever is highest.\n\nCPI inflation for September 2019 was 1.7%, today's figures confirm. However, average weekly earnings rose by 3.9% in the year to May to July.\n\nDespite the rise for pensioners, working-age benefits are still in limbo despite claimants being driven into debt and turned to food banks under Tory austerity.\n\nThe Prime Minister has so far refused to confirm the freeze on working-age benefits will end as planned in April 2020.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nMinisters previously said the freeze would end in April, and former Tory welfare chief Amber Rudd urging Mr Johnson to honour the pledge.\n\nBut new DWP Secretary Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey today refused to give a firm pledge that the benefit freeze will end in April 2020.\n\nShe told MPs the DWP is in talks with the Treasury over 120 benefit rates. But she added: \"Until I get the analysis which is due before the end of the month, then I won\u2019t be in a position to say exactly what we\u2019ll do on every single product line.\u201d\n\nShe added: \"I think there\u2019s a general desire from the PM to see how we have that increased prosperity and how we then share the benefits of increased prosperity with everyone in society.\n\n\"I can\u2019t give you a definitive outcome.\n\n\"We\u2019re looking very carefully right now on what we can do about the benefits going forward from 2020.\"\n\nMost working-age benefits were limited to 1% rises for three years from 2013 then frozen for four years from 2016.\n\nWriting in July, MPs demanded Boris Johnson reversed the cruel freeze by handing families bumper rises of 4% per year for four years.\n\nThe Work and Pensions Committee said Tory austerity had \u201csteadily eroded\u201d benefit rates by nearly \u00a31bn more than planned, and \u201cvery disadvantaged people are losing out\u201d.\n\nMs Coffey faced a stormy two-hour grilling from MPs on the Work and Pensions Committee today a month after replacing Amber Rudd, who quit over Brexit .\n\nThere were angry exchanges as she:\n\nDenied the two-child cap on benefits has driven kids to poverty;\n\nClaimed Universal Credit is \"working\" in her seat with a score of \"9.9/10\";\n\nClaimed forcing UC claimants to borrow an advance from their own future benefits to bridge a 5-week gap \"actually works\";\n\nRevealed officials are looking at making the Universal Credit work allowance more generous;\n\nBut refused to introduce automatic split payments to couples on UC, despite fears abuse victims are being financially controlled;\n\nAnd refused to say how many DWP staff are forced to rely on benefits themselves, claiming it was \"personal data\";\n\nConfirmed a review of benefit sanctions will be published by Christmas;\n\nConfirmed DWP is now investigating 85,000 suspected advance payment frauds after Universal Credit claimants fell victim to a scam;\n\nConfirmed 20,000 severely disabled people unlawfully lost out on cash when they moved to UC. So far 14,000 have been repaid an average of \u00a32,280 each.\n\nFor a full write-up of today's hearing click here.", "description": "DWP ministers have refused to confirm they'll end the Tory benefit freeze - despite pensioners enjoying an inflation-busting rise of over \u00a36 per week in April 2020", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Ealing Gazette", "Leader", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10282712.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/PROD-Pensioner-household-incomes-study.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
