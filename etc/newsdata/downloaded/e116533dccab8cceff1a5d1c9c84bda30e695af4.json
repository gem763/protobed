The company said it made the decision after talking with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and reviewing data showing the therapy helped Alzheimer\u2019s patients\u2019 cognitive function and their ability to perform basic tasks.\n\nIn March, the company said a major trial of the drug, aducanumab, had been a failure. That announcement sent Biogen\u2019s shares down by more than 25% and raised questions about the firm\u2019s future.\n\nInvestors erased most of those losses after the new announcement Tuesday, giving Biogen shares their biggest intraday gain on record. The stock jumped as much as 42% to $318 -- nearing where the stock traded before the March plunge.\n\nThe Cambridge, Massachusetts-based drugmaker said in a statement that it plans to send its application to the FDA early next year. It is developing the treatment in partnership with Japan\u2019s Eisai Co.\n\nBiogen Chief Executive Officer Michel Vounatsos said the company met with the FDA Monday and got the agency\u2019s blessing to move ahead. \u201cWe got clear support from the FDA,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. The company does not believe it needs to conduct additional trials of the drug before moving ahead.\n\nThe company also reported third-quarter financial results on Tuesday, though last quarter\u2019s numbers will almost certainly be overwhelmed by investors\u2019 review of a drug that, if it reaches the market, would upend the industry and reset Biogen\u2019s future. Adjusted earnings were $9.17 per share, topping the $8.27 per share average of analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\nData Review\n\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s results are certain to receive closer-than-usual scrutiny from regulators and investors, as well as rival drugmakers who have abandoned other related treatments after similar, earlier setbacks.\n\nIn the new analysis, Biogen looked at data from the two final-stage trials of more than 3,000 patients. A subset of patients treated with the highest dose of aducanumab had what the company said was a statistically significant slowing of decline of cognitive ability and basic activities of daily living.\n\nThe announcement shocked a medical field that\u2019s grown used to failure after failure, and is skeptical that a previously unsuccessful trial could be the basis of drug that will make a meaningful difference for patients.\n\n\u201cStatistically significant does NOT guarantee clinically meaningful,\u201d said Samuel Gandy, the associate director of the Mount Sinai Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center in New York. \u201cI want to believe, but I\u2019m not ready to suspend disbelief.\u201d\n\nIt may not matter. There are no currently approved treatments to slow or stop Alzheimer\u2019s, a neurodegenerative disease that is the most common cause of dementia in the U.S. and robs people of their ability to remember and to perform basic tasks. Biogen\u2019s drug targets beta amyloid, a protein that forms clumps of plaque in the brain and is thought to be a cause of the disease.\n\nBiogen\u2019s drug reduced levels of the plaques, the company said. While other companies\u2019 drugs have shown a similar effect on beta amyloid, they failed to provide better clinical results for patients. The drug does not appear to cure the disease, only to slow its progression.\n\nThe data giving the company hope is from a trial called EMERGE, which included 1,638 people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The company made the initial decision to discontinue the trials based on results from December, but kept collecting information from patients and looking at the data. As more data rolled in, the company saw a positive signal from the group getting the highest dose of the drug. In a presentation to investors Tuesday, Biogen said the initial analysis had been incorrect.\n\n\u201cAfter consultation with the FDA, we believe that the totality of these data support a regulatory filing,\u201d Biogen said in the presentation.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s has led to failure after failure in the drug industry, often after large, costly efforts that showed glimmers of hope in early trials that ultimately led to disappointments in larger test. Any successful drug is likely to be a blockbuster, given the millions of potential patients and the lack of competition.\n\n\u201cSo many companies ran away from this space,\u201d Vounatsos said.\n\n(Updates stock-price movement in fourth paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Riley Griffin in New York at rgriffin42@bloomberg.net;Michelle Fay Cortez in Minneapolis at mcortez@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Drew Armstrong at darmstrong17@bloomberg.net, C\u00e9cile Daurat, Timothy Annett\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Biogen Inc. will ask U.S. drug regulators to approve the company\u2019s experimental Alzheimer\u2019s therapy, reviving the nearly abandoned treatment after a new analysis of data from two failed clinical trials showed promising results.The move by Biogen -- if successful -- would be the drug industry", "authors": ["Riley Griffin", "Michelle Fay Cortez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/udVvKCE9pcmuCFPDlMYj6A--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/5735e17af7d52bc1c33a5b0c3589d985", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
