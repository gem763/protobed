USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump on Wednesday shared an altered image on Twitter of himself giving what is being interpreted as a canine version of the Medal of Honor to the military dog that suffered minor wounds in the raid that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\n\"AMERICAN HERO!\" read the all-caps tweet accompanying the photo.\n\nThe Belgian Malinois joined in the U.S. special operations raid on the Islamic State leader's compound near the Syria-Turkey border. Al-Baghdadi's death was made public on Sunday when Trump delivered a televised address from the White House.\n\nArmy Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, lauded the canine's \"tremendous service\" and said it was \"still in theater.\" He declined to share the animal's gender or name for security reasons.\n\nPhotoshop skills are not known to be part of Trump's social media repertoire. Though it's possible a president can learn new tricks, the image bears a watermark from the conservative news site The Daily Wire, which shared the image in a Tuesday tweet.\n\nThe original image appears to be an Associated Press photo of Trump giving the Medal of Honor to Vietnam veteran James McCloughan in 2017.\n\n#DeclassifiedDog: Twitter shares their 'declassified' dog pics after Trump tweet\n\nPresident Donald Trump bestows the nation's highest military honor, the Medal of Honor, to retired Army medic James McCloughan during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House, July 31, 2017, in Washington. (Photo: Alex Brandon, AP)\n\n\"Please, @realDonaldTrump,\" read the tweet, along with the image. That tweet came a day after Trump tweeted about the classified canine, praising it for the \"GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS.\"\n\n\"Bravo @realDailyWire meme makers,\" tweeted Benny Johnson, the chief creative officer for Turning Point USA.\n\nThe president's post caused howls of laughter among some Twitter users, while others clearly had a bone to pick with the decision to crop out a war hero or with the quality of the Photoshop job.\n\nWhat a way to treat a war hero. Also, look forward to the tick tock about how much time Trump spends asking about the dog and how much executive branch effort is being made to get the dog to the White House. pic.twitter.com/VsALBoNnuS \u2014 Brendan Nyhan (@BrendanNyhan) October 30, 2019\n\nSomewhere out there, Donald Trump Jr. is photoshopping his face over the dog\u2019s face. https://t.co/VXHigYnIq6 \u2014 Full Frontal (@FullFrontalSamB) October 30, 2019\n\nI think this @HuffPost reporter irrationally losing it over Trump posting a fun picture honoring a dog that killed off the number one terrorist leader in the world is right, everyone.\n\n\n\nStop having fun. https://t.co/HQB8bS7hYb \u2014 Brandon Morse (@TheBrandonMorse) October 30, 2019\n\nYou... photoshopped giving a medal to the Delta Force dog?\n\n\n\nReally? \u2014 P\u00e9 Resists (@4everNeverTrump) October 30, 2019\n\nThey photoshopped the dog receiving a medal? pic.twitter.com/LWdibVfGsi \u2014 Is_It_Just_Me (@Is_It_Just_Me1) October 30, 2019\n\nTHAT DOG DESERVES ALL THE TREATS \u2014 Logan Hall (@loganclarkhall) October 30, 2019\n\nThis hero pup was raised to protect us, so Trump had to photoshop this picture because the dog would bite him. \u2014 Nick Jack o'Lantern Pappas (@Pappiness) October 30, 2019\n\nContributing: Tom Vanden Brook\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/30/trump-tweets-altered-image-himself-bestowing-medal-hero-dog/4099611002/", "description": "The altered\u00a0image shows Trump giving a canine version of the Medal of Honor to the dog wounded in the\u00a0raid that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.", "authors": ["William Cummings", "Published P.M.
