And what Altuve had was a bat. And what that bat had was one more mighty swing. In the bottom of the ninth inning Saturday night, in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series, it propelled a slider from Aroldis Chapman, the New York Yankees\u2019 flamethrowing closer, over the wall in left \u2014 a two-run homer that ended the ALCS and put the Astros in the World Series against the Washington Nationals.\n\nThey will soon raise another AL pennant in Houston, the second in three years, after a dramatic, 6-4 victory Saturday night in which the Astros ended the Yankees\u2019 season for the third time in five years. The Astros are loaded with high-end talent and blessed with ample creativity and resolve \u2014 but after the high-wire act they pulled off with their pitching in Game 6, they were also in desperate need of a day off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Astros were two outs away from victory, and the Yankees two outs from oblivion, when DJ LeMahieu, the Yankees\u2019 first baseman, smashed a two-run, opposite-field homer off Astros closer Roberto Osuna to tie the score \u2014 leaving the Astros \u00adplayers doubled over in anguish and the ecstatic Yankees on the top step of their dugout. \u00adLeMahieu\u2019s homer came at the end of a 10-pitch at-bat in which he fouled off four straight two-strike pitches from Osuna.\n\nHaving led the entire game, the Astros were suddenly in both an emotional hole and a personnel one. They had blown through all the best arms in their bullpen, while the Yankees still had their closer, Chapman, ready in theirs.\n\nIn lieu of fourth starters, both teams opted for the once-dreaded, now-trendy bullpen game Saturday night, started by New York\u2019s Chad Green and Houston\u2019s Brad Peacock.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was still a jarring sight given the stakes. It was also, if we\u2019re being honest, kind of fun.\n\nOn a 1-to-10 scale of organized chaos, where one is the running of the bulls in Pamplona and 10 is a 3-year-old\u2019s birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese, a double-bullpen game on the second weekend of a league championship series is something like a six. Unofficial press-box oddsmakers put the over-under on the time of game at four hours (it was 4:09), the over-under on pitching changes at 12.5 (there were 12).\n\nBy the bottom of the first, the Astros had a 3-0 lead, courtesy of Yuli Gurriel\u2019s three-run homer off Green. By the top of the second, the Yankees had brought the go-ahead run to the plate. By the bottom of the second, both teams were on their second pitchers of the night. By the top of the third, the Yankees had put the go-ahead run on base, and the game was visited by its fifth pitcher of the night. And on and on it went.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo understand how two exceptional teams, winners of 210 regular season games and payroll-spenders of nearly $400 million between them, with Cy Young winners, multiyear all-stars and future Hall of Famers populating their pitching staffs, wound up with a pair of solid but unheralded relief pitchers starting for them in Game 6 of the ALCS, you must begin with the rise of the opener as a pitching strategy beginning with the Tampa Bay Rays in 2018 \u2014 and its subsequent spread across the game.\n\nYou must recall, as well, that both teams lost their presumptive No. 4 starters down the stretch \u2014 the Astros\u2019 Wade Miley to acute underperformance and the Yankees\u2019 Domingo Germ\u00e1n to a domestic violence suspension.\n\nThen there were the immediate factors spawned by the events of the past few days: Wednesday night\u2019s rainout in New York, which counted among its casualties Friday\u2019s scheduled travel day; the Yankees\u2019 victory in Game 5 on Friday night in the Bronx, which kept the series alive; and the desires of both teams to hold their aces, Cole and Luis Severino, in reserve for a potential Game 7.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd so, Game 6 began at 7:09 p.m. Houston time with Peacock, who had closed out Game 5 for the Astros, on the mound, thus making him the first pitcher since Firpo Marberry of the 1924 Washington Senators to start a playoff game the day after finishing one.\n\nIn a game such as this, the managers are bound to have a larger say in the outcome than is typical. New York\u2019s Aaron Boone and Houston\u2019s A.J. Hinch sequenced their pitching with a fluid combination of scripted preferences and on-the-fly reaction. The Astros suffered a setback in the top of the third when Ryan Pressley, at his best a high-leverage monster with an unhittable curveball, suffered a knee injury while fielding a comebacker that stranded the bases loaded.\n\nThe Astros chose to go without a lefty on their staff for this series, owing to the overwhelming right-handedness of the Yankees\u2019 lineup, and Jose Urquidy\u2019s excellent change-up, which helped him hold lefties to a .530 on-base-plus-slugging percentage this season, was one reason. It was Urquidy who in the sixth inning was saved by Reddick\u2019s diving catch in right on a liner by Brett Gardner, a left-handed hitter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFrom there, Hinch could deploy his best arms in a more or less conventional manner \u2014 Will Harris for four outs, Joe Smith for three. In the ninth, he had Osuna, an elite closer, warmed and ready to go. But Yankees third baseman Gio Urshela greeted him with a sharp single, and two batters later, LeMahieu weeded through nine other pitches until he found one, a 94-mph cutter, he could drive to right.\n\nA hundred years ago, the Yankees reached the end of the 1910s without a World Series appearance. On Dec. 26, 1919, they purchased a spindly legged pitcher-turned-outfielder named Babe Ruth for $100,000 from the Boston Red Sox, won three championships behind him in the 1920s and never again endured a decade without at least getting to the final series \u2014 until the decade that comes to a close later this month.\n\nOver the course of a 103-win season, the Yankees rarely came up against a team that was better. But over six games in this ALCS, it became clear that they had \u2014 if only by the smallest of margins, a single Altuve.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more on baseball:\n\nAD", "description": "After New York ties Game 6 of the ALCS with a DJ LeMahieu homer in the top of the ninth, Altuve wins it for Houston with two outs in the bottom of the inning.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZxKWHoIGiPHvbkioh9z5DRMWr10=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/24AYYMXS6MI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
