[Amazon boss] Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world and this his how his company is run.'\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos is worth an estimated \u00a3118.2billion, with Amazon valued at \u00a3730billion.\n\nBut Mr Gabay, who did not pass his probation and no longer works for the company, says warehouse employees paid \u00a310.50 an hour regularly fall ill from over-exertion.\n\nHe also says staff are forced to comply with a 'power hour' when managers shout while loud music is played on speakers in a bid to increase productivity.\n\nMr Gabay, who joined a union and believes he was not kept on because of his membership, has also claimed workers are denied medical treatment.\n\nOne pregnant woman was not given a break despite being in severe pain, he says.\n\nAnother pregnant employee told the newspaper she was reprimanded for not hitting 120-items-an-hour targets.\n\nHe claims his colleagues (Tilbury depot pictured) 'walked around like zombies' as they were forced to pack 250,000 items during a 10-hour night shift\n\nShe said: 'I couldn't go any faster. They're always putting pressure on.\n\n'I'd sometimes get a 10-minute break because I was tired, but they have their eye on you.'\n\nOne other employee claimed an ambulance was not called after a heavy package fell on her, describing conditions as 'modern slavery'.\n\nTheir claims come after a Sunday Times investigation found ambulances were scrambled to a UK Amazon warehouse every two days in the last year.\n\nThe paper found emergency services were sent at least three times a week to employees who had collapsed or were suffering breathing problems.\n\nAmbulances were called to an Amazon warehouse in the UK once every two days last year as workers suffered collapses and breathing problems.\n\nHe also says staff are forced to comply with a 'power hour' when managers shout while loud music is played on speakers in a bid to increase productivity.

And in 2018 alone there were 193 ambulance calls.\n\nAmazon has denied poor working conditions at the Tilbury depot.\n\nA spokesman told MailOnline: 'We do not recognise these allegations as an accurate portrayal of activities in our building.\n\n'Tilbury fulfilment centre is a safe and positive workplace providing good jobs for 2,500 permanent employees where all associates receive industry-leading pay, starting at \u00a310.50p/h, and comprehensive benefits from day one.\n\n'Safety is our number one priority and we take the wellbeing of our associates extremely seriously. We will always call an ambulance if one is required.\n\n'Our team of on-site first-aiders follow NHS guidance when an ambulance should be called.\n\n'We benchmark against UK national data, published by the Health & Safety Executive, confirming we have over 40 per cent fewer injuries on average than other transportation and warehousing businesses in the UK.'", "description": "Michael Gabay, 42, described his time at Amazon's Tilbury depot in Essex (interior pictured) as '100 days of hell'.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/08/19980574-0-image-a-6_1571643963360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
