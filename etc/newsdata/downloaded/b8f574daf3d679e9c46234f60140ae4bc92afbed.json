Everyone knows where we stand on this.\"\n\nJames McGrory said: \u201cWe are asking Rudd and Heneghan to quit because no-one - least of all the millions of people in the country who are desperate for us to succeed - can allow boardroom politics to overshadow the real politics taking place on Brexit .\n\n\u201cThis has been a brilliant cross-party campaign and this is a crucial week in the fight to stop Boris Johnson forcing his Brexit on the people. We are ready to launch the biggest and most sophisticated tactical voting campaign this country has ever seen if there is an election.\n\n\u201cBut Roland Rudd has chosen now to put a wrecking ball through the campaign, locked key staff out of the office and tied others up in legal threats.\n\n\u201cAll we want to do is get back to campaigning for a People\u2019sVote. None of us chose to get into a fight with the Open Britain board. Instead, those seeking to disable this extraordinary campaign must now take responsibility for playing into Johnson\u2019s hands.\u201d", "description": "Staff members said the sacking of the group's director and communications director was \"utterly absurd\"", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Image", "Andy Rain Epa-Efe Rex", "Getty Images", "Publicity Picture"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20750352.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Labour-Party-Conference-in-Brighton-United-Kingdom-21-Sep-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
