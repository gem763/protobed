But the heartland is in wait-and-see mode, bruised by a roller coaster trade war and anxious to see whether Asian buyers stick to the fluid agreement.\n\nThe administration and a Chinese delegation announced a \u201cphase one\u201d deal about a week ago, giving Mr. Trump a chance to crow about a win for farmers who backed him in 2016 but have seen their Chinese markets for soybeans and other crops crater.\n\nMr. Trump said he drove a hard bargain by insisting that the Chinese buy more than double the $20 billion in purchases they\u2019re accustomed to \u2014 even if farmers struggle to keep up with the demand.\n\n\u201cI said tell them to go out and get bigger tractors, right?\u201d he told supporters in Texas. \u201cOnly American tractors. We only buy American tractors. Go out and get bigger!\u201d\n\nYet farmers are used to hearing big promises, only to see another ripple in talks. The Chinese have been reluctant to cite the $50 billion number, explicitly, saying they\u2019re eager to buy U.S. products but that their involvement should be driven by market needs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d probably hold off on buying that new tractor yet,\u201d said John Newton, chief economist for the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\nEven Mr. Trump admits his trade delegation and Chinese officials are still trying to put details on paper ahead of a planned signing ceremony next month in Chile with President Xi Jinping.\n\nBut the president, squeezed by an impeachment inquiry and questions around his Syria policy, is talking about farmers and tractors every chance he gets, as his potential 2020 rivals make their own promises in early Democratic primary states like Iowa.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is the first person to take a stand against China for decades of unfair trade practices and is holding them to account,\u201d said Trump campaign spokeswoman Erin Perrine. \u201cThose \u2018America First\u2019 policies of the Trump administration have Americans all across the country living in the strongest economy in decades.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump characterized the first phase of Chinese talks as the fruit of major deal making on farmers\u2019 behalf. He boasted about it to supporters in Dallas and talked up U.S. farmers in front of Italian President Sergio Mattarella and the Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues, saying the hockey players\u2019 agents would \u201cbe proud\u201d of the deal he cut with China.\n\nPolitical analysts said people should get used to the pitch.\n\n\u201cFarmers and folks in manufacturing areas are key to his reelection, given the pivotal states involved in the election,\u201d said G. Terry Madonna, a politics professor at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania. \u201cHe is going to continue to stress trade deals as a central focus of his campaign.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration and Chinese officials have been trying to strike a trade deal for over a year. They seemed close last spring, yet talks fell apart after the U.S. accused their counterparts of reneging on key details.\n\nMr. Trump continued to push for one major deal, though he now says it makes sense to break up the talks into phases. The phase one China deal has been greeted with optimism, since it suggests the needle is moving in the right direction.\n\nTrump officials say China will be buying an annual $40 billion to $50 billion in farm products within two years. And while China said the announcement is \u201cconsistent\u201d with their intentions, the figure is well above what the Chinese typically buy.\n\n\u201cWhile the Chinese have said that they generally agree with the president\u2019s take on the agreement, they reportedly have not confirmed the amount of agricultural purchases,\u201d said Jenny Hopkinson, a senior government relations representative for the National Farmers Union. \u201cA lot could happen as they hash out details over the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nPatty Judge, chairwoman of Focus on Rural America and a former Iowa lieutenant governor and agriculture secretary, said farmers will want to see firmer commitments, saying they have been disappointed by this administration on other issues, such as ethanol policy.\n\n\u201cThe president seems to think if he has a telephone call or a conversation, he can make a deal. I think people are in wait-and-see mode here,\u201d said Mrs. Judge, a Democrat. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to be nice folks, but we\u2019re also going to have some skepticism about what is going on with our leaders in Washington.\u201d\n\nSteve Scheffler, a Republican National Committeeman for Iowa, said farmers are willing to stick it out for Mr. Trump, in part because they view Democratic candidates as too far-left.\n\n\u201cI think they understand the alternative would be devastating,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know that China has taken our country for a ride. They understand you know you gotta be a tough negotiator.\u201d\n\nFarmers largely support Mr. Trump and say it\u2019s important to take on China\u2019s unfair trade practices. Yet they\u2019ve taken it on the chin during Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war, causing them to wonder whether there are other ways to take on the Asian superpower. Soybean sales, in particular, have suffered, dropping to around 10 million tons amid the trade war instead of around 30 million tons they shipped out in previous years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re been unfairly retaliated against, the agricultural community, What many of our framers and ranchers want is to get back to business as usual,\u201d Mr. Newton said.\n\nThere have been good signs, including a recent surge in soybean purchases and an uptick in demand for pork, as China suffers from an outbreak of African swine fever.\n\nMrs. Judge said families aren\u2019t focused on the day-to-day in Washington \u2014 harvest time is coming \u2014 but they could use some peace of mind from the world\u2019s two biggest economies, so they know who\u2019s buying their product.\n\n\u201cWe are going to harvest corn and beans right now and we have to know what we\u2019re doing,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thing that agriculture needs more than anything is stability.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
