Beckham, the oh-so-dynamic wideout obtained in the most celebrated of offseason trades with the New York Giants, led the way with a six-catch, 161-yard performance. He turned a short pass over the middle from quarterback Baker Mayfield into an 89-yard touchdown in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cI was cramping all game,\u201d Beckham told ESPN after the game. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to stay hydrated, drinking more water, and I just couldn\u2019t find a way to not cramp. So I was running down there. I was just praying that I was going to make it. I gave it all I had, tried to kick it into overdrive.\u201d\n\nBen Roethlisberger out for the season, will have elbow surgery\n\nWilliams, who had swapped long-distance barbs with Beckham last week, was caught by the TV cameras expressing his extreme dissatisfaction on the Jets\u2019 sideline as Beckham sprinted to the end zone. Beckham also set up a first-half field goal with a one-handed catch just before being ordered out of the game temporarily by the officials, much to his dismay, to have the illegally tinted face shield removed from his helmet.\n\n\u201cI mean, all I want is it to be fair around the league,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna tell me to do something, do it for everybody else. You let people stay in the game on \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019 with gold visors. Everybody else has tinted visors. And then you pull me off and it hurts my team and I hurt my team on third and goal. You know, you can warn me, do something. But don\u2019t pull me off on third and goal. All I want is it to be fair. I just want to play football.\u201d\n\nBeckham had accused Williams last week of teaching \u201ccheap shots\u201d and \u201cdirty hits,\u201d citing a 2017 preseason game in which Beckham suffered an ankle injury while with the Giants. He later was told by Browns players, he said, that Williams had told Cleveland players to target him.\n\nWilliams, the former defensive coordinator for the Browns who served as their interim head coach last season, countered that his defenses play \u201chard, fast, physical\u201d but not dirty. Williams, suspended for more than a year by the NFL for his role in the Bountygate scandal with the New Orleans Saints, told reporters not to give Beckham attention and brought up the Giants\u2019 decision to trade the wide receiver to the Browns.\n\nDrew Brees, an NFL iron man, reportedly will have thumb surgery, miss about six weeks\n\n\u201cOdell who?\u201d Williams asked jokingly when he met with reporters last week.\n\nHe knows now. Adore him or despise him, there\u2019s no taking one\u2019s eyes off Beckham when he\u2019s on a football field.\n\nMayfield was told after the game Monday that Williams had suggested that Beckham was not dynamic playmaker.\n\n\u201cHe said that?\u201d Mayfield said, before adding soon after: \u201cNext question. Not a dynamic football player?\u201d\n\nBeckham\u2019s exploits Monday night came on his former home field at MetLife Stadium.\n\n\u201cHonestly it was a pretty warm reception,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was nothing but love. I feel like I\u2019ve lost enough games period. I\u2019ve lost enough games here. So to leave this one with a win is a good feeling.\u201d\n\nThe Browns weren\u2019t all that sharp Monday but their star power was on display. Mayfield threw for 325 yards on 19-for-35 passing. Tailback Nick Chubb ran for a touchdown. Myles Garrett had three sacks, upping his league-leading total through two games to five.\n\nThe lack of restraint that plagued the Browns against the Titans also showed up Monday night, however. Garrett committed two roughing-the-passer penalties and knocked Jets quarterback Trevor Siemian from the game with a first-half late hit on which Siemian fell backward and his left leg folded beneath him. Siemian was able to walk from the field and limp to the locker room. The Jets, already playing without starter Sam Darnold, turned to No. 3 quarterback Luke Falk the rest of the night.\n\nThe schedule toughens considerably from here for the Browns. Their next five games come against currently unbeaten teams: the Los Angeles Rams, Baltimore Ravens, San Francisco 49ers, Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots. Three of those games are on the road. The Browns will have to be better than they\u2019ve been so far.\n\n\u201cA win is a win,\u201d Mayfield said at his postgame news conference, \u201cespecially on the road\u2026. Yeah, we need to play better.\u201d\n\nBut it appears to be a two-team race between the Ravens and Browns in the AFC North, with the Pittsburgh Steelers off to a 0-2 start and minus quarterback Ben Roethlisberger because of his season-ending elbow injury. The Browns will have their chances to live up to all that promise. If Beckham plays like he did Monday, they\u2019ll be a difficult matchup for anyone.\n\n\u201cWe fought hard,\u201d Beckham told ESPN. \u201cThis is a banged-up Jets team. And we just found a way to win. It wasn\u2019t our best game. We\u2019ve got a lot to still work on. But we\u2019ll take the W\u2019s however they\u2019re gonna come.\u201d\n\nIn-game updates\n\n4th Quarter\n\nBell loses fumble: The frustrations continue for the Jets. Le\u2019Veon Bell had a 17-yard catch for what would have been a first down at the Cleveland 7-yard line. But he lost a fumble and the Browns recovered. (Browns 23, Jets 3 with 7:34 remaining in the 4th quarter)\n\n3rd Quarter\n\nLong TD for Beckham: Odell Beckham Jr. has won the night with an 89-yard touchdown catch. Beckham took a short pass from Baker Mayfield in the middle of the field and sprinted the remaining 78 yards or so to the opposite end zone. (Browns 23, Jets 3 with 3:32 left in the 3rd quarter)\n\nJets fail on fourth down: The Jets finally got their offense moving a little bit with Luke Falk at quarterback. He had a 36-yard completion to wide receiver Robby Anderson. But Coach Adam Gase left his offense on the field for a fourth-and-two try from the Cleveland 12-yard line, and Le\u2019Veon Bell was tackled just shy of a first down after taking a swing pass from Falk. (Browns 16, Jets 3 with 3:35 left in the 3rd quarter)\n\nGarrett dominating: Myles Garrett has three sacks in this game and five on the season to lead the NFL. He also had two first-half roughing-the-passer penalties and knocked Jets quarterback Trevor Siemian from the game with a late hit. (Browns 16, Jets 3 with 7:10 left in the 3rd quarter)\n\nWR Demaryius Thomas (hamstring) and QB Trevor Siemian (ankle) are out. #CLEvsNYJ \u2014 #TakeFlight (@nyjets) September 17, 2019\n\nHALF: Browns 16, Jets 3\n\nHalftime at the Meadowlands: Take that, Gregg Williams. Odell Beckham Jr., after trading long-distance barbs last week with the defensive coordinator of the Jets, had a good first half for the Browns, with three catches for 54 yards. He had one of his trademark one-handed grabs to set up a Cleveland field goal. There also was some of the drama that so often surrounds the wide receiver, albeit in mild form tonight. He and Browns Coach Freddie Kitchens had words with the officials early in the game when Beckham was ordered to have the tinted face shield removed from his helmet because it violates NFL rules. Beckham jogged off the field with 20 seconds remaining in the first half after sitting on the ground in the end zone following an incompletion on Cleveland\u2019s final drive of the half. A 25-yard completion from Baker Mayfield to wideout Jarvis Landry set up the third field goal of the night for Browns kicker Austin Seibert, a 43-yarder as time expired in the half. Cleveland got a second-quarter touchdown run by tailback Nick Chubb. Beckham accused Williams during the lead-up to this game of coaching dirty hits and cheap shots. But it was the Browns who were guilty of the most egregiously illegal hits in the first half. Cleveland\u2019s Myles Garrett was penalized twice for roughing the passer, the second time with a late hit on Jets fill-in starter Trevor Siemian that knocked him from the game. Siemian was bent over backward and his left leg folded beneath him. He was able to walk off the field on his own and he later limped to the locker room. The Jets, already without starter Sam Darnold, turned to No. 3 quarterback Luke Falk. Siemian and Falk combined for four first-half passing yards on four completions. The Jets even tried a Wildcat offense at times, with direct snaps to tailback Le\u2019Veon Bell, but scored only on a 46-yard field goal by kicker Sam Ficken. (Browns 16, Jets 3 at halftime)\n\n2nd Quarter\n\nFG for Jets: The offense of the Jets actually began to move the ball after Luke Falk took over for the injured Trevor Siemian at quarterback. That was accomplished mostly by Falk handing the ball off to running back Le\u2019Veon Bell. Sam Ficken connected on a 46-yard field goal to get the Jets on the scoreboard, drawing loud cheers from a Meadowlands crowd weary of the team\u2019s kicking misadventures. (Browns 13, Jets 3 with 2:56 left in the 2nd quarter)\n\nSiemian hurt: Jets quarterback Trevor Siemian was hurt on a late hit by the Browns\u2019 Myles Garrett that drew a roughing-the-passer penalty. Luke Falk has taken over at quarterback for the Jets, who already are without starter Sam Darnold. Siemian was able to walk off the field and then limp to the locker room even after having his left leg folded beneath him as he fell backward when hit by Garrett after delivering a throw down the field. It was the second roughing-the-passer penalty of the game for Garrett. (Browns 13, Jets 0 with 7:58 left in the 2nd quarter)\n\nBrowns convert fourth down on way to TD: The Browns have the first touchdown of the night courtesy of a 19-yard run by tailback Nick Chubb. That came just after Coach Freddie Kitchens left his offense on the field for a fourth-and-two gamble from the 24-yard line. Baker Mayfield threw an incompletion but the drive was extended by a defensive holding penalty on the Jets. (Browns 13, Jets 0 with 10:16 left in the 2nd quarter)\n\n1st Quarter\n\nJets\u2019 offense sputtering: The Jets are doing nothing on offense so far with quarterback Sam Darnold out of the lineup because of mononucleosis. Fill-in starter Trevor Siemian doesn\u2019t have a completion yet and was sacked once by Myles Garrett on the opening drive. The Jets unveiled a Wildcat-style offense on their second possession with a direct snap to running back Le\u2019Veon Bell on the opening play. Nothing is working so far, and the Jets have punted twice. (Browns 6, Jets 0 with 5:18 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nSecond FG for Browns: The Browns made it two field goals on two possessions. Kicker Austin Seibert connected from 48 yards after Baker Mayfield overthrew Odell Beckham Jr. on third down. (Browns 6, Jets 0 with 6:15 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nBeckham told to get rid of helmet shield: The problem with Odell Beckham Jr.\u2019s helmet shield was that it was tinted, rather than clear. He was told by officials that was not permitted, and he had to leave the game to have it removed from his helmet. Beckham was not pleased about it and could be seen protesting about it to officials.\n\nBeckham catch leads to FG: It was an uneventful opening drive for Odell Beckham Jr. and the Browns. Beckham made one of his brilliant one-handed catches along the sideline for a 33-yard gain that gave the Browns a first down at the 4-yard line of the Jets. But he was on the sideline for their third-and-goal play from the 5-yard line, obviously displeased, as team officials worked on his helmet for what ESPN described as an issue with Beckham\u2019s tinted face shield. Both Beckham and Browns Coach Freddie Kitchens exchanged words with the officials over the matter. Baker Mayfield threw the ball away on the third-and-goal play, and the Browns settled for a field goal.
