And it really hurts \u2026 our national patriotic feelings that they buy bad tulip bulbs.\"\n\nThrough a commissioned study, the association bought 1,364 tulip bulbs at Amsterdam's famous floating flower market, and after planting them, only 14 \u2014 or one per cent \u2014 flowered. None looked as pictured on their package.\n\nThey also conducted an investigation at another famous market in Lisse, where they purchased 426 bulbs. Only nine flowers \u2014 or two per cent \u2014 bloomed, and only one looked as advertised.\n\nComplaints as far back as 20 years\n\nThe alleged fraud amounts to potentially millions of dollars each year, Hoogendijk says.\n\n\"We've been getting a lot of complaints from tourists that they bought tulip bulbs in Amsterdam, that they planted them in their gardens, that they didn't flower at all the next year,\" he said.\n\n\"So then we started to look into these markets where they sell these bulbs, and then we found out they sell very old bulbs that are impossible to flower again.\"\n\nPeople walk past the floating flower market in Amsterdam.

The KAVB has not named the company they suspect is responsible.\n\n\"[The vendors] are disappointed at the results. Of course they all say that their own bulbs are fine but their neighbours' bulbs, the other vendors \u2026 are bad quality. But we made sure that we bought tulip bulbs at every stall at the market.\"\n\nHoogendijk says the KAVB and the city of Amsterdam have reported the matter to the Dutch consumer watchdog.\n\nTourists can still find genuine bulbs\n\nThe investigated markets are visited by millions of tourists each year, and Hoogendijk said complaints about the bulbs go back as far as 20 years.\n\n\"[Tourists] go home, most of them don't complain, and if they complain they don't know where to go,\" Hoogendijk said. \"So they send out an email or something else but they don't go back to the market and ask for money back, [and] that's why these market vendors have been able to keep doing this for years now.\"\n\nFor any tourists concerned about purchasing these fake bulbs, Hoogendijk reassures buyers that they can find genuine bulbs in garden centres that will almost always flower.\n\n\"Just go to your local garden centre either in Holland or in Canada \u2026 go there right now, buy tulip bulbs and you'll be perfectly happy.\"\n\nWritten by Chelsey Gould.
