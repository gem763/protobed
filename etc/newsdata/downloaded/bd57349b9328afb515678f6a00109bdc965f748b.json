(AP) - With Super Bowl 2020 just around the corner, the idea is a tempting proposition: Got a spare room or home to rent? Lease it out to party-minded football fans who need a place to stay for the big game in Miami.\n\nAnd why not? South Florida hotels are filling up fast, prices are rising toward the nose bleed section and home sharing appears to be the best alternative for consumers who don\u2019t hobnob with the rich and famous.\n\nAirbnb, the international home sharing platform, is conducting a series of workshops next month to show would-be \u201chosts\u201d in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties how to jump into the game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to target people putting out an initial home or a room for the Super Bowl,\u201d said Airbnb spokesman Sam Randall.\n\nAirbnb and its Georgia hosts were active last February for Super Bowl 2019 in Atlanta, which \u201csaw nearly 11,000 guest arrivals with supplemental host income of nearly $3.5 million, close to $700 per host.\u201d Nearly a quarter of the hosts were first-timers.\n\nThus far in South Florida, more than 11,000 fans have booked townhomes, condos and other digs between Jan. 30 and Feb. 2, the day of the game, Randall said. A little more than 4,000 of them are in Broward. No data was available for Palm Beach County. But he said the Airbnb booking numbers for the game are \u201csignificantly higher\u201d in January and early February than in non-Super Bowl years.\n\n\u201cDuring these events, home sharing not only expands available lodging options but give hosts the chance to earn extra income by sharing their home while helping guests live like a local,\u201d the company said in a statement. It projects an average daily room rate of $136 for the South Florida hosts.\n\nBut while homesharing might be a tempting idea, it\u2019s not a clear path to a quick buck, veteran hosts warn. The business itself takes a level of attentiveness that is not for the impatient investor.\n\nFort Lauderdale real estate agent Sara Dorfman, who is now in her fourth year as an Airbnb host, operates a triplex in Victoria Park for short-term renters. She also maintains a property in the city\u2019s upscale Rio Vista section.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot (of work) and a lot of people don\u2019t want to take it on,\u201d she said.\n\nShe suggested that owners willing to commit to the business beyond the Super Bowl are the most likely ones to make money at it.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see how it would be worth it,\u201d she said of renting only for the Super Bowl. \u201cYou have to be approved by the city and have a certificate of occupancy from the city.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, the upfront local government fees alone range into the hundreds of dollars.\n\nFor those who do want to enter homesharing game, here are some tips:\n\n- Homeowners should check with their local governments to ensure homesharing is permitted in their towns or cities, and if so, obtain copies of the rules. Many cities such as Fort Lauderdale require homeowners to register, obtain permits and pay initial and seasonal fees. Cities also require onsite inspections as well as fire alarms, fire extinguishers, carbon monoxide detectors and land telephone lines in the event of emergencies.\n\n- Screen inbound guests. \u201cI don\u2019t do that for every single inquiry,\u201d Dorfman said. \u201cBut I really try to be extra cautious\u201d during high profile events such as the Super Bowl. Ask how many people are in the group? What are the ages? What\u2019s the purpose of the trip? \u201cUsually those three questions get it done,\u201d she said. If the would-be renters balk, it\u2019s easy to move on to the next rental candidate.\n\n- Make sure the property you\u2019re offering via social and other media channels actually reflects the environment and amenities advertised. One time, Dorfman recalled, a girlfriend came to town for a bachelorette party only to find her unit had no pool furniture. But it was depicted in an ad that contained professional photos from the Realtor.\n\n- Make sure the guests \u201chave the accommodations they need \u2014 a comfortable home they can go into, not something (the host) threw together in the last minute.\u201d Remove personal belongings from the home.\n\n- Know your area and be prepared to answer guest questions about the community, restaurants, landmarks and how to get around. \u201cHosts who are very successful are the ones who live here,\u201d Dorfman said. \u201cYou have to cater to the guests. You have to make yourself available and really help them out.\u201d\n\n- Once established, operators have lots of opportunities to turn their properties into cash generators.\n\nFor the Super Bowl, Dorfman acknowledged that like the hotels, she, too, is raising her rates. Two and three-bedroom units are going from $300 a night to $500 or $550.\n\n\u201cThis year alone has been one of our busiest years and already we have had requests for the Super Bowl,\u201d she said. \u201cI have two of my properties booked for the Super Bowl already. I\u2019m pretty much booked from the current day through New Year\u2019s.\u201d\n\n- Let a manager do it\n\nFor those homeowners or investors who don\u2019t want to bother with the details of running a homeshare operation, there are management companies that will do the job for a fee.\n\nKeyes Property Management is ramping up such an operation for homeowners between Miami and Port St. Lucie, said Benjamin Gene, the company president. Of the 600 condos and single family homes the company manages, 25 are in play as short-term rentals.\n\n\u201cOne of the nice pieces of the homesharing business is the prices can increase,\u201d he said. \u201cWe absolutely intend to see a rather large increase for the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nHis main worry: that big, unruly parties will offer political ammunition for homesharing opponents to persuade cities to heavily regulate operators \u201cand put them out business.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Sun Sentinel , http://www.sun-sentinel.com/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With Super Bowl 2020 just around the corner, the idea is a tempting proposition: Got a spare room or home to rent?
