Here is part of their conversation.\n\nDid you know that Megan Murphy would be part of this panel before you rented the space?\n\nAbsolutely, we knew that.\n\nAnd you knew that Ms. Murphy has argued that trans women should not be allowed into women's locker rooms ... bathrooms or prisons, and that allowing people to self-declare their legal gender will \"nullify women's rights.\" You knew all of that?\n\nYes, we did. We were well aware of the Vancouver Public Library controversy, where Meghan Murphy was allowed to speak. There's actually a YouTube video of that event, which we reviewed.\n\nAnd the room rental purpose was to have an educational and open discussion on the concept of gender identity and its legislation ramifications on women in Canada.\n\nMeghan Murphy runs the website Feminist Current and says transgender women should not be allowed in women's bathrooms, locker rooms or prisons.\n\nThe purpose of this \u2014 to look at what does it mean for society, the law and women \u2014 it wasn't an educational session, was it? This is someone who says that these rights should not exist, is that not the case?\n\nWell, it's a discussion. It's part of a civil discourse that people are having in the larger community about gender identity.\n\nWhat is that discussion? What are the two sides of that discussion?\n\nWe are a democratic institution and we are standing up for free speech. That's what I'm standing up for. I'm not getting into a discussion about the two sides of this issue, or the three sides of this issue, or the four sides of this issue.\n\nBut if you have somebody within that discussion who denies that these rights should exist ... is that really a side? Or is that denying somebody their rights?\n\nPeople in the community, on social media, have been describing this as hate speech. It's not defined under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ... as a hate speech. Otherwise, Megan Murphy would not be allowed to speak about these things. She would be facing criminal charges. But she's not.\n\nSometimes ... when you're defending free speech, you're in a very uncomfortable position where you're defending perspectives and ideas and viewpoints that many in the community, or a few in the community, whatever, find offensive.\n\nBut it's at that time that it's most important to stand up for free speech. That is what makes Canada a democratic country, and that is what we need today more than ever.\n\nSometimes what we call free speech is hurtful speech. And we have a situation, as you know, the numbers are that about 20 per cent of trans people [in Ontario] have been physically or sexually assaulted due to their identity [according to the Canadian Mental Health Association.] Even more have been verbally threatened or harassed. So how do you safeguard them physically and their rights, if you feel that it's within others' rights to express ideas that deny those people their rights?\n\nI am committed, and the library is committed, to offering safe and welcoming space for everyone, including members of the trans community.\n\nBut as a public library and as a public institution, we have an obligation to stand up for our democratic values and principles, and that free speech is something that protects everyone.\n\nBut it really \u2014 and I really need to emphasize this \u2014 it really protects the marginalized voices in our society. And if it wasn't for free speech, those marginalized voices would not be heard.\n\nBut you also have within your policy that the library reserves right to deny or cancel a booking \"that is likely to promote, would have the effect of promoting discrimination, contempt or hatred for any group or person.\" Do you think that that is not what was happening here?\n\nThere is a very high bar for establishing what is hate speech in this country. It is established in the Criminal Code of Canada, and that bar is very high to allow free speech to flourish.\n\nYou think someone has to be charged criminally before you would not allow them to speak in your facilities?\n\nWe use the same principles in making decisions about room bookings as we do for our collections, Carol. We have a broad diversity of information and ideas and perspectives that are represented in all the books in our collections, and some of those ideas and perspectives people would find hurtful and painful.\n\nBut we're not going to remove those books from our collection. And we are not going to eliminate programs from our branches that are controversial. And we're not going to shut down room bookings because the speaker in the room booking has controversial ideas.\n\nA group of Ontario authors say they plan to stop participating in Toronto Public Library events if a talk featuring Murphy goes ahead. (Katherine Holland/CBC)\n\nAre there any limits to who you would rent the space? I mean, would a Holocaust denier or a white supremacist be able to speak at one of your facilities?\n\nYou may recall we had a neo-Nazi group a few years ago rent one of our facilities and we allowed it. And that was for a memorial service. It was based on the purpose of booking.\n\nIf the purpose of the booking is going to result in hate speech or a discussion about hate speech, then no, we will not allow it.\n\nLibrary workers, the union workers, they are very upset about this. They say that the staff has worked very hard to build trust in the community, to create a safe and inclusive space for everyone who uses it, and they feel that this is very damaging to that. What do you say to your own workers?\n\nThis is about free speech and, you know, I think that it's important to understand that when you're defending free speech, as a democratic institution that the library is, there are times when there are people in that community who are not happy with it, which is certainly the situation we find ourselves in right now with the decisions that we make.\n\nThere are limits to free speech. I'm sure you know that. And when free speech is hurtful or harmful to others, it is something that is shutting down the free speech of others. I'm sure you've heard that argument before.\n\nYes, I have.\n\nAnd you don't agree, obviously.\n\nNo, I don't. I think that free speech is important, especially ... when people people are trying to shut down marginalized groups.\n\nThe marginalized groups being those who would deny the rights of those trans people, who are feeling this is hurtful. So what about those minority rights? What consideration are you giving to those minority rights?\n\nWe're giving everyone consideration in this situation.\n\nHow do you think a trans person ... would feel sitting in the room with this panel discussion? Do you think that they would feel safe?\n\nWe've heard from trans people and other people who are very supportive of us. But they don't want their voices to be out there. They asked us to keep it in confidence and keep their communication to us in confidence, because they just don't want reprisal on social media.\n\nAnd I think that speaks to the fact that this is the controversy that needs to be discussed. I think it's a controversy that needs to be out there in the public realm.\n\nThe mayor of Toronto believes in free speech, but he has asked you to not hold this event. Will you reconsider?\n\nI'm not going to reconsider ... supporting free speech.\n\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear with files from CBC News. Interview produced by Chloe Shantz-Hilkes.
