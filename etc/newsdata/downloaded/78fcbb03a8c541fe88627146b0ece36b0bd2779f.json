REUTERS/Tom Brenner/File Photo\n\nBut Republican Trump\u2019s more than 1,200 Facebook ads in Spanish during the same period hardly mention his signature campaign promise to be tough on immigration.\n\nInstead, they warn that Democrats want Venezuela-style socialism and advertise \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d merchandise, according to a Reuters review of more than 69,000 of Trump\u2019s Facebook ads since May. Venezuela is mired in an economic crisis and the Trump administration is using sanctions to try to force socialist President Nicolas Maduro from power.\n\n\u201cDo you approve of socialism? Yes or no?\u201d reads the Spanish-language text of several ads. Others tout a strong U.S. economy or bash prominent leftist Democratic Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar.\n\nThe contrast suggests a high-stakes balancing act for Trump ahead of the November 2020 election as he tries to fire up his white Republican base, which applauds his tough stance on immigration, while also courting Latino voters, who could be the largest minority voting bloc next year.\n\nTrump, despite his divisive rhetoric calling Mexicans \u201cmurderers\u201d and \u201crapists,\u201d won nearly a third of the Latino vote in the 2016 election. And 29% of Latinos approve of Trump\u2019s performance in office, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted between July and September, though that is lower than 39% approval among all Americans.\n\nBuilding on that support will be key to win increasingly diverse states, including Arizona and Florida.\n\nBut Hispanics are less likely than non-Hispanic whites to support Trump\u2019s immigration policies, such as his now-abandoned practice of separating families detained at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nAmong Latinos who consider immigration the most pressing political issue - above healthcare and the economy - about four in 10 support conservative policies such as tightening border security, compared to eight in 10 among non-Hispanic whites, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nGiven the split nature of the issue, leaving immigration out of Spanish-language ads could be wise for Trump, said Mike Madrid, a Republican political strategist in Sacramento, California.\n\nBut for 28-year-old IT worker Jeremiah Espinoza in Houston, who dislikes Trump\u2019s immigration stance, the ads - whether in English or Spanish - are toxic anyway.\n\nEspinoza blocked an English-language \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d ad when it appeared on his Facebook feed a few days after a gunman killed 22 people, most of them Hispanic, in El Paso, Texas in August.\n\n\u201cI think it is pretty cruel in general,\u201d Espinoza said of Trump\u2019s immigration policy, particularly separating families.\n\nSpanish is widely spoken among America\u2019s roughly 60 million Hispanics. Spanish speakers make up about 10% of the U.S. electorate, with large numbers in battleground states such as Arizona and Florida.\n\nTrump, already running the largest digital advertising operation in the 2020 campaign, has run more ads in Spanish than all of the 18 Democratic presidential contenders combined, according to the Reuters analysis of Facebook ad data, which was gathered by computer scientists at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York University. tmsnrt.rs/34agfQz\n\nDemocrats, led by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, are also running ads in Spanish. But unlike Trump, their messages mirror English-language ads, often lauding the contributions of immigrants and calling out Trump\u2019s immigration policies as divisive or racist.\n\nLATINOS FOR TRUMP?\n\nLatinos historically skew Democratic in presidential elections but some Latinos believe that Trump\u2019s economic policies and positions on issues such as abortion reflect their conservative values.\n\n\u201cI do believe more Latinos are for Trump but are afraid to come out,\u201d said Erika Cousino, 28, a Latina and stay-at-home mother in Luna Pier, Michigan who thinks Trump\u2019s ads are a good way to reach the community.\n\nDaniel Bucheli, a Trump campaign spokesman, declined to say why the Facebook ads in Spanish largely skirted the subject of immigration, but added the campaign can appeal to Latinos by focusing on a strong economy, including a historically low jobless rate for Latinos.\n\nThe campaign has brought that message to a series of rallies aimed at Latinos throughout 2019, including a \u201cVamos to Victory\u201d tour of events in Texas, New Mexico and Florida.\n\nAmong Trump\u2019s Facebook ads in Spanish between May and Oct. 15, none included text calling for tougher immigration policies, according to the Reuters analysis of ad data published by Facebook, which includes ad text but not photos or videos.\n\nThe tone of Trump\u2019s English-language ads on immigration has been harsh. Dozens say an \u201cinvasion\u201d is underway.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Members of the audience look on as U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks at a Keep America Great rally at the Santa Ana Star Center in Rio Rancho, New Mexico, on September 16, 2019.
