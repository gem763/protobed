At its 10th anniversary celebration this evening, Riot Games announced a new version of League of Legends called Wild Rift that will be coming to both mobile devices and unspecified consoles.\n\nIt looks to be largely the same as the main version of League, with near-identical MOBA gameplay. But it\u2019s been tweaked to better accommodate the new platforms, including a new twin-stick control scheme, a new map, and shorter matches that clock in at around 15-20 minutes long. \u201cWild Rift is not a port of LoL on PC,\u201d Riot says, \u201cit is a new game built from scratch to ensure it is a polished, legitimate LoL experience that\u2019s worth players\u2019 time.\u201d\n\nA mobile version of League, which first launched back in 2009, has been rumored for years. In the meantime, other games, including the Tencent-developed Arena of Valor, have seen a lot of success filling in that niche. (Riot is also owned by Tencent.) Meanwhile, other popular PC games \u2014 most notably Fortnite, Call of Duty, and PUBG \u2014 have grown substantially by expanding to mobile and other platforms. In fact, PUBG Mobile is among the highest-grossing mobile games in the world, while Call of Duty recently had one of the biggest launches in mobile history.\n\nThe mobile version of Wild Rift is launching in 2020, with preregistration available today through Google Play. There\u2019s no word yet on when the game will be available on console.", "description": "League of Legends is making its long-awaited debut on mobile and console, with a new version called Wild Rift that\u2019s scheduled to launch in 2020.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jy3OYk-foL2Gs9lnC_yg6lAxsUg=/0x358:5000x2976/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19289874/1147660222.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
