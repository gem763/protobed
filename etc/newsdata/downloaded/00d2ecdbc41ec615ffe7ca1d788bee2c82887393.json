Hundreds died.", "language": "en", "text": "But the carnage actually happened nearly a century ago when a white mob in Tulsa descended on Greenwood, a black business district so prosperous it was dubbed \u201cBlack Wall Street.\u201d\n\nThe Tulsa race massacre began May 31, 1921, when a white mob set fire to hundreds of black-owned businesses and homes, killing at least 300 people. More than 10,000 black residents were left homeless, and as many as 40 blocks were left smoldering.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlack men, women and children who survived were rounded up and detained in camps at the city\u2019s fairgrounds. Survivors of the massacre recounted seeing the bodies of black people loaded onto trains and dumped off bridges into the muddy Arkansas River. Witnesses reported seeing bodies tossed into mass graves.\n\nNow the city is investigating whether those mass graves exist using ground-penetrating radar.\n\nFor nearly 100 years, the truth of what happened in Tulsa was kept out of textbooks and only whispered about among survivors. \u201cWatchmen\u201d will be the first time many people will learn about the rampage.\n\nSeeing so many tweets that #Watchmen was the first time they heard about Black Wall Street and had no idea that our opening depicted the Tulsa Massacre which had not been taught in US history classes made me want to post this post from The Post: https://t.co/jiLH9M4Wt6 \u2014 Regina King (@ReginaKing) October 21, 2019\n\nThe violence started unfolding the afternoon of May 30, 1921, when \u201cDick\u201d Rowland, a 19-year-old black man working as a shoe shiner, walked into the Drexel Building in downtown Tulsa. The city was still fiercely segregated, and the Drexel Building had the only toilet in downtown available to black people.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRowland stepped into an elevator on the first floor. By the time the elevator doors opened on the third floor, someone heard the white elevator operator, Sarah Page, shriek.\n\n\u201cWhile it is still uncertain as to precisely what happened in the Drexel Building on May 30, 1921, the most common explanation is that Rowland stepped on Page\u2019s foot as he entered the elevator, causing her to scream,\u201d the Oklahoma Historical Society reported.\n\nRowland was taken into custody.\n\nThe Tulsa Tribune newspaper published a story with the headline \u201cNab Negro for Attacking Girl in Elevator\u201d and ran an ominous editorial: \u201cTo Lynch Negro Tonight.\u201d\n\nA white mob gathered outside the Tulsa County Courthouse, where Rowland had been jailed. The mob demanded that the sheriff turn over Rowland, but the sheriff refused.\n\nAD\n\nDozens of black men, including World War I veterans, heard of Rowland\u2019s arrest and rushed to the courthouse to protect him. A struggle ensued. A shot was fired. Then hundreds of white people marched on Greenwood in a murderous rage.\n\nAD\n\nThe massacre had begun.\n\n\u201cOver the next six hours, Tulsa was plunged into chaos as angry whites, frustrated over the failed lynching, began to vent their rage at African Americans in general,\u201d according to the Oklahoma Historical Society.\n\n\u201cFurious fighting erupted along the Frisco railroad tracks, where black defenders were able to hold off members of the white mob.\u201d\n\nAn unarmed black man was slain inside one of Greenwood\u2019s theaters. \u201cCarloads of armed whites began making \u2018drive-by\u2019 shootings in black residential neighborhoods,\u201d according to the historical society. \u201cBy midnight, fires had been set along the edge of the African American commercial district. In some of the city\u2019s all-night cafes, whites began to organize for a dawn invasion of Greenwood.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhite city police officer \u201cdeputized\u201d members of the lynch mob and \u201cinstructed them to get a gun and get a n-----,\u201d according to the Oklahoma Historical Society.\n\nAD\n\nThere were reports that white men flew airplanes above Greenwood, dropping kerosene bombs. \u201cTulsa was likely the first city\u201d in the United States \u201cto be bombed from the air,\u201d according to a 2001 report by the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921.\n\nB.C. Franklin, a Greenwood lawyer and the father of renowned historian John Hope Franklin, wrote a rare firsthand account of the massacre later donated to the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n\n\u201cThe sidewalk was literally covered with burning turpentine balls,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor fully forty-eight hours, the fires raged and burned everything in its path and it left nothing but ashes and burned safes and trunks and the like that were stored in beautiful houses and businesses.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey tried to kill all the black folks they could see,\u201d a survivor, George Monroe, recalled in the 1999 documentary \u201cThe Night Tulsa Burned.\u201d\n\nOn June 1, 1921, martial law was declared. Troops rounded up black men, women and children and detained them for days in camps in the city.\n\nFor many years, few people in Tulsa spoke about what happened. The massacre, often called the Tulsa race riot, was deliberately kept out of textbooks.\n\nAD\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1998 that officials in Oklahoma began investigating the claims of mass graves. Investigators used electromagnetic induction and ground-penetrating radar to search for evidence at Newblock Park, which operated as a dump in 1921, and at Booker T. Washington Cemetery and Oaklawn Cemetery.\n\nAD\n\nAt each site, they found anomalies \u201cthat merited further investigation,\u201d according to the commission\u2019s report. Then in 1999, a white man named Clyde Eddy, who was 10 at the time of the massacre, came forward and told officials he was playing in Oaklawn Cemetery in 1921 when he spotted white men digging a trench. When the men left, Eddy said, he peeked inside the wooden crates and saw corpses of black people.\n\nBased on Eddy\u2019s story, state archaeologists began investigating the section of the cemetery Eddy cited. The effort was led by Clyde Snow, one of the world\u2019s foremost forensic anthropologists who helped identify Nazi war criminals and had determined that more than 200 victims found in a mass grave in Yugoslavia had been killed in an \u201cexecution-style act of ethnic cleansing,\u201d according to his obituary in The Post. Snow traveled the world as a human rights expert, searching for people who had disappeared in atrocities and massacres.\n\nAD\n\nUsing ground-penetrating radar, they made a dramatic discovery: an anomaly bearing \u201call the characteristics of a dug pit or trench with vertical walls and an undefined object within the approximate center of the feature,\u201d the commission concluded. \u201cWith Mr. Eddy\u2019s testimony, this trench-like feature takes on the properties of a mass grave.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe commission recommended excavation of the potential mass graves. But city officials decided not to dig for physical evidence.\n\nThe case seemed closed until last year.\n\nIn 2018, Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum (R) announced he would reopen the investigation into mass graves, calling it a murder investigation. The announcement came days after a Washington Post story detailed unresolved questions surrounding the massacre.\n\nEarlier this month, scientists and forensic anthropologists armed with ground-penetrating radar began scanning the grounds of Tulsa\u2019s Oaklawn Cemetery, looking for anomalies that might be consistent with mass graves. The cemetery, which is owned by the city, is just a few blocks from Black Wall Street.\n\nLast week, the city expanded its search to include other areas in Oaklawn Cemetery that were identified by survivors and descendants of white Tulsans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to Oaklawn Cemetery, the city said, it would use ground-penetrating radar to investigate Newblock Park and Rolling Oaks Memorial Gardens, which was once known as Booker T. Washington Cemetery.\n\nThe city hopes to finish the investigation by December or January.\n\nIf the city finds evidence of mass graves, city officials and an oversight committee will decide whether to excavate. The Oklahoma medical examiner\u2019s office would lead the investigation into determining the cause of death.\n\nRead more Retropolis:", "description": "The 1921 rampage was one of the worst episodes of racial violence in U.S. history.
