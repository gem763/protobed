They raised two sons, Charles and Luis, painted, designed jewelry, played jai alai, and attended bullfights. They socialized with Rivera (who painted a muscular Louis shirtless) and Kahlo (a devoted fan of Annette\u2019s art, which shows the clear influence of Picasso, Gauguin, and the Mexican muralists) and Trotsky (albeit only briefly). They entertained these and other notable guests at their magnificent home in Tlacopac, which is now an international artist residency. Annette would later recall dressing up in traditional Mexican costumes and hats with Rivera and Kahlo and \u201chamming it up.\u201d\n\nBut their bliss was not to last. After Pearl Harbor, 41-year-old Louis insisted on returning to Brooklyn to enlist in the U.S. Navy and left an enraged Annette in Mexico City with the kids. Louis was a patriot, an avowed fan of Winston Churchill, and a conservative to his core, and there was no way he was going to wait out World War II with a bunch of artists in Tlacopac.\n\n\n\nA few months after Louis shipped out to fight the Japanese, Annette struck up an affair with Conlon Nancarrow, a brilliant Arkansas-born composer, marijuana enthusiast, socialist, and recovering Stalinist who had volunteered in the Spanish Civil War and was later exiled to Mexico, where his work would only become well known many decades later. Annette\u2019s marriage with Louis fell apart after the war, and she ended up wedding Nancarrow and taking his surname. Although she would have one more husband after that, Annette Nancarrow remains the name by which she is best known. The rest of her life\u2014in which she received an award for one of her murals from the president of Mexico, mingled with celebrity refugees from McCarthyist Hollywood in Acapulco, and eventually split her final years between Mexico City and New York\u2014is well worth reading about. Annette represents one set of values her grandson might have embraced.\n\nSo to summarize: Bret Stephens\u2019s grandfather\u2014a captain of industry, a Navy man, a staunch conservative\u2014was cuckolded by a leftist composer while he was off fighting in the Pacific. It\u2019s tempting to get Freudian about the origin of Bret\u2019s politics, and that\u2019s a temptation I ought to avoid, except, well, Bret himself said the following, in his 2011 eulogy for his father Charles:\n\nHe was literally born into the ideological feuds of the 20th century. My grandmother Annette was an acquaintance of Leon Trotsky, a friend of Anais Nin and Diego Rivera. Her third husband was the communist composer Conlon Nancarrow. My grandfather Stevie worshipped Winston Churchill, believed in free enterprise and a strong defense, hated communism. My grandparents divorced when my father was eight, and you could say my father wasn\u2019t neutral between his parents\u2019 points of view.\n\nYou could indeed say that. Charles, born in 1937 in Mexico but raised in Los Angeles after his parents\u2019 divorce, was, at least to hear Bret tell it, \u201ca real macho man\u201d and a classic Cold Warrior. He visited the USSR in the 1950s intending to pass out copies of George Orwell\u2019s 1984 (he did not end up going through with this plan). In 1970, Charles organized the Youth Committee for Peace With Freedom and led 100 young people to Washington to demand the Nixon administration continue to bomb Southeast Asia. Again, to quote Bret from his eulogy:\n\nIn the late 1960s [Charles] became one of the very few people to actually protest in favor of the Vietnam War. Now that took self-confidence. As a graduate student at UCLA he got the Students for a Democratic Society kicked out after they tore down some of his posters depicting Vietcong atrocities.\n\n\n\n(Just as a side note here, leftists have apparently been fighting with the Stephens men over free speech on college campuses for half a century. But I digress.)\n\nHe met Richard Nixon in the Oval Office and advised him to mine Haiphong Harbor and resume the bombing of North Vietnam\u2014which in fact is exactly what Nixon wound up doing. He campaigned for Congress in 1974 on a platform opposing the decriminalization of pot and supporting the government of South Vietnam.\n\n\n\nAs this panegyric suggests, Charles\u2019s political career in the United States was dead on arrival. Soon enough he returned to Mexico City, along with his wife Xenia and their newborn son Bret, to help his brother run the chemical company they inherited. (Xenia, I\u2019ll pause to note, was born in Italy in 1940 to a refugee who had fled from the Bolsheviks in Moscow and from Hitler in Berlin; she survived a childhood under Mussolini before emigrating to the U.S. at age 10, and her experience recently moved Bret to stand up for refugees against the Trump administration\u2019s draconian policies, which is entirely to his credit.)\n\n\u201cTo this day,\u201dStephens has said, \u201cevery column I write is written with my dad\u2019s voice sounding in my ears.\u201d\n\nWhile managing General Products, Charles also developed a side gig penning fiery anti-communist op-eds for the English-language newspaper there. (At least one of these broadsides was reprinted in Human Events, Ronald Reagan\u2019s favorite publication, which supported apartheid in South Africa and also published such luminaries as Ann Coulter, Pat Buchanan, and Newt Gingrich.) Stephens credits his father with inspiring his own career in journalism. \u201cThat\u2019s how I learned what an editorial page was; that\u2019s how I learned how to turn a phrase; that\u2019s how I learned to place a political argument in a historical context and a philosophical frame,\u201d he said of his father\u2019s newspaper days, adding, \u201cTo this day, every column I write is written with my dad\u2019s voice sounding in my ears.\u201d\n\n\n\nBret waves away his father\u2019s inherited privilege. \u201cI sometimes suspect that some people who knew my father only superficially thought that his entire life came down to good luck: First-born son, born to a wealthy father, naturally good looking, that kind of thing,\u201d Bret said of Charles. But, he added, \u201cThe truth of my father\u2019s life is that the good things that happened to him happened mainly on account of the choices he made. The wealth he leaves behind isn\u2019t the wealth he inherited ... My dad made his own luck.\u201d Not to begrudge anyone a bit of hyperbole in the context of mourning a parent, but this is the sort of phony rugged individualist myth one embraces when, for instance, trying to defend the Trump tax cut while complaining that it \u201cbarely cuts the top income-tax rate.\u201d\n\nConservative pundit tropes weren\u2019t the only thing young Bret absorbed while growing up in Mexico City. Speaking at an interfaith conference in Jerusalem in 2003, Bret recalled being raised by secular Jewish parents and receiving no religious education or Bar Mitzvah, but nonetheless confronting \u201ca hostile environment for Jews.\u201d This, at least, was how Bret justified what to me reads as contempt for the vast majority of Mexicans. According to Israel Insider, \u201cStephens saw Catholicism as practised in Mexico with its heavy pagan influences as \u2018primitive.\u2019\u201d He changed his mind when he left Mexico for university and met American Christians.\n\n\u201cIt was a revelation to me that you could be a sincere Christian and not be a peasant,\u201d he said. According to Israel Insider, \u201cAs he became more committed to Israel, it was hard not to notice [...] that it was Christian conservatives who were amongst the most supportive of Israel.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Bret came around on Christians after he met some who were white (and pro-Israel). But while Bret\u2019s views on Christianity may have evolved, his subsequent publicly expressed opinions of Arabs and Muslims seem to echo his earlier attitude toward the \u201cprimitive\u201d Mexican \u201cpeasants.\u201d\n\nBret spent most of the first 14 years of his life in Mexico, but then attended an elite boarding school in Massachusetts, followed by the University of Chicago. He initially hoped to major in anthropology (he wanted to be Indiana Jones) but found his first course in the discipline \u201ckind of grim and political and tedious.\u201d He therefore opted for political philosophy, which allowed him to stay comfortably within the Western canon under the mentorship of the neoconservative scholar Leon Kass, who would eventually become known for advising George W. Bush to ban stem-cell research.\n\nAlthough Bret would later claim that \u201cwhat I really wanted to do was go to officer candidate school and be a Naval officer\u201d as his grandfather had, it turned out that he had high blood pressure. So instead, immediately following graduation, Bret went to work at Commentary before earning an M.A. from the London School of Economics. He then joined The Wall Street Journal as an op-ed editor at 25, moved to Brussels to cover the European Union, and was appointed editor-in-chief of the Jerusalem Post at 28, just months after the 9/11 attacks. \u201cOne of the reasons I left The Wall Street Journal for the Post was because I felt the Western media was getting the story wrong,\u201d Bret later told the UJA-Federation of Greater Toronto. \u201cI do not think Israel is the aggressor here. Insofar as getting the story right helps Israel, I guess you could say I\u2019m trying to help Israel.\u201d While in Jerusalem, he enthusiastically championed the Bush administration\u2019s war on terror and the invasion of Iraq, and in 2003 he named Paul Wolfowitz the Post\u2019s Man of the Year.\n\nIn 2004 Bret returned to the Journal, where he was eventually promoted to deputy editorial page editor, and where he won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 2013, the same year he wrote a column comparing Palestinians to mosquitos. In 2017, newly appointed New York Times opinion editor James Bennet made Bret\u2014by this point among the most prominent of the small handful of \u201cNever Trump\u201d conservatives\u2014his first hire. And you know the rest.\n\nIn 2016, The New York Times listed Mexico City as its #1 travel destination in the world, dubbing it \u201ca metropolis that has it all.\u201d It was an overdue choice; Mexico\u2019s capital, which had long been written off by a certain kind of tourist as polluted, dangerous, and sprawling, is in fact one of the most sophisticated cities on earth for visual arts, historic architecture, and fine dining, and is finally being recognized as such in the U.S. Annette Nancarrow was way ahead of her time in this regard.\n\nYou can learn a lot in Mexico City. You can see the world\u2019s largest collection of Meso-American art at the National Anthropology Museum; the excavated Aztec ruins of the Templo Mayor; the explicitly Marxist murals of Diego Rivera at the heart of the National Palace; the charming Casa Azul where Frida Kahlo lived, and the bullet-ridden home of Trotsky a few blocks away. You can see great wealth and great poverty, and you can meditate on why the latter always seems to accompany the former. You can attempt to reckon with a genocidal crime that began five centuries ago and never really ended. And if your family had a personal connection to the Mexican ruling class, you might feel it incumbent upon yourself to do so.\n\nOr you can learn different lessons. You can learn, for instance, that society should operate according to a rigid social caste system, in which business and artistic elites intermingle in lavish homes while dismissing and fearing the rabble outside the gates. You can learn to be from a place without really being of it, to take pride in the cachet of having lived there while spending your adult life in a series of very rarified, very white, and very gringo institutions. You can learn to identify instead with the Israelis as they dominate and colonize the land where their perceived inferiors have lived for centuries. Once you\u2019ve absorbed all of that, a lifetime tenure at the most powerful op-ed page on earth awaits you.", "description": "How one columnist\u2019s wild family history explains an increasingly isolated school of conservatism", "authors": ["David Klion"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/3285a6223993b190f9e4205ab09ff3a693e24bdd.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
