That man, Brandt Jean, was permitted to give a victim\u2019s impact statement after the sentencing of Amber Guyger, an ex-cop convicted of killing his brother, Botham. Guyger opened the door to Botham Jean\u2019s apartment, thinking it was her own, and shot him as an intruder. She was given ten years in prison for her deed.\n\nPut down what you\u2019re doing and watch this three-minute clip. I hope that I can one day be half the man, and half the Christian, that Brandt Jean is. The courage will take your breath away.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
