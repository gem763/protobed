Now they have a presence in the World Series as well.\n\nFirst baseman Ryan Zimmerman and reliever Sean Doolittle of the Washington Nationals are both products of the Cavaliers\u2019 baseball program. Zimmerman was drafted by the Nationals out of Virginia in 2005 and Doolittle was a first baseman and pitcher for the Cavaliers, drafted by the Oakland Athletics in 2007.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only Virginia school with World Series connections.\n\nHouston ace Justin Verlander and Washington reliever Daniel Hudson both pitched at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, though they were not there at the same time. Verlander grew up near Richmond while Hudson was born in Lynchburg and, like Zimmerman, went to high school in the Tidewater region.\n\nFor good measure, former James Madison University players Doug Harris and Jeff Garber are part of the player development efforts of the Nationals. Harris is the assistant general manager while Garber is a co-field coordinator in the minor leagues and has worked with nearly every infielder in the system at some point, including Zimmerman and Anthony Rendon.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
