His resignation package contained $127,450 in \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d in addition to lost wages, according to the report.\n\nOn Twitter in 2016 and 2017, Mr. Riley jeered at the American flag and law enforcement as symbols of racism and oppression.\n\n\u201cThe [American] flag represents a systemic history of racism,\u201d read one tweet Mr. Riley sent in September 2017. \u201cPolice are a part of that system. Is it that hard to see the correlation?\u201d\n\nAnother tweet from Mr. Riley read, \u201cI\u2019m baffled about how the 1st thing white people say is, \u2018that\u2019s not racist!\u2019 when they can\u2019t even experience racism? You have 0 opinion!\u201d\n\nMr. Riley resigned Sept. 4, the same day Breitbart exposed the tweets.\n\nNo fault was acknowledged by Mr. Riley or the University of Alabama in the agreement, but its terms prohibit either side from commenting.\n\nThe University of Alabama this semester has 38,103 students, 75% of whom are white, 10.5% black and 4.8% Hispanic, according to the school\u2019s Office of Institutional Research and Assessment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
