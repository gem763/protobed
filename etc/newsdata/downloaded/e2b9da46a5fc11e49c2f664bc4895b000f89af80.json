The Democrats would be all too happy to roll back tariffs with no demands on China.\n\nXLY Daily Chart\n\nOn Friday, the Consumer Discretionary SPDR ETF (XLY) dropped below the uptrend line since the December bottom, as well as slightly below the bottom of a rising channel since the Aug. 15 bottom. The only other ETF to fall below the uptrend line since the December low is the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: ), which is in an established downtrend.\n\nTo clarify, the sub-index could still bounce above both uptrend lines, in the medium as well as the short term. So far, it has support of the 50 DMA, while the 200 DMA realigned with the Aug. 15 low, a potential double top neckline.\n\nHaving said that, an even lower close below the medium term uptrend line and short term rising channel would tip the scales further toward a reversal.\n\nBoth the MACD and the RSI have provided sell signals. The former\u2019s short MA fell below the longer one, demonstrating recent weakness. The latter gave a heads up of falling out of the rising channel two weeks ago, and since then has developed a downtrend within a falling channel. Friday, it fell even lower than that, suggesting a steeper decline.\n\nTrading Strategies\n\nConservative traders would wait for the medium term to settle on a clear trend, posting either a higher high or a lower low.\n\nModerate traders might enter a short after closing below the 200 DMA and proving resistance on a return move.\n\nAggressive traders may short at will, after matching a trade plan to their account.\n\nTrade Sample\n\nEntry: $122\n\nStop-Loss: $123, above Thursday\u2019s high\n\nRisk: $1.00\n\nTarget: $119, above 200 DMA\n\nReward: $3\n\nRisk:Reward Ratio: 1:3", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com) covering: Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR, Energy Select Sector SPDR.
