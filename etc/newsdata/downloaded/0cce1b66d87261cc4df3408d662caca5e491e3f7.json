It\u2019s like a rehearsal room, you have to use your imagination while you\u2019re working,\u201d Bernthal said. \u201cBut seeing it come to fruition and seeing all the beautiful work that the artists and technicians have done on the game, filling in the world \u2026 it\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s incredible how talented these folks are.\u201d\n\nHe said acting for motion capture presented unique challenges.\n\n\u201cObviously, wearing that silly outfit with the dots on your face is pretty crazy, but you get over it fast,\u201d Bernthal said.\n\n\u201cSuspending your disbelief is sort of a job requirement for me, so it\u2019s no more ridiculous than walking out in the woods and thinking that there\u2019s zombies out there. You\u2019ve got to believe in the given circumstances of the world that you\u2019re playing in.\u201d\n\nUnexpected turn\n\nWalker, like Punisher hero Frank Castle, is a former soldier whose life took an unexpected turn that sent him down a different path.\n\n\u201cI think with both of them, there\u2019s an acute change in their life and their mission becomes highly personal,\u201d Bernthal said. \u201cWith Frank Castle, it\u2019s all about what happened to his family, and it changed the kind of person who he was, and his new mission encompassed him fully.\n\n\u201cI think you could argue with Cole that he always felt the way that he feels. I think he was always frustrated with the protocols and the standards and moral compass of the Ghosts.\u201d\n\nWalker, a high-ranking member of the Ghost Recon team, turned against the military to avenge fallen teammates whose deaths he blamed on the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he looks at himself as having changed for evil, or decided to live his life according to bad motivations,\u201d Bernthal said. \u201cI think his motivations are the same all the way though, he\u2019s just decided to go after his goals and what he\u2019s searching for in a more direct and, to him, a more honest and unadulterated way.\u201d\n\nBernthal said he had the opportunity to work with combat veterans from multiple service branches while creating the game.\n\n\u201cThe honor of my career \u2014 the thing that I value most \u2014 are the vets that I\u2019ve gotten to work with that have helped train me not just in the way I fight and the way I use weapons, but the way I walk, the way I talk, and to get into the mindset. That\u2019s something that I value enormously, something that I cherish with all my heart,\u201d he said.\n\nGhost Recon 4 \u201cwas written by combat vets and it was performed, at least in my case, under the scrutinizing eye of combat vets, guys from the special forces and the green berets,\u201d Bernthal said. \u201cI think authenticity is paramount for the folks at Ubisoft in making this game and that really gels with me and the way that I like to work.\u201d\n\nFord v Ferrari\n\nBernthal\u2019s next major project is as automotive mogul Lee Iacocca in James Mangold\u2019s Ford v Ferrari. The film follows the story of a Ford Motor Co. team working to create a racing car to defeat Ferrari\u2019s vehicle at the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race in 1966.\n\nIacocca is best known for his tenures as president of both Ford and rival Chrysler Corp., but the film sees him early in his tenure as vice president at Ford.\n\n\u201cI think the Lee Iacocca that Jim was really interested in was not the Lee Iacocca from the bestselling novel or the Lee Iacocca as this bastion of industry at the top of his game, he wanted to focus on Lee Iacocca as the young, hungry, ambitious company outsider,\u201d Bernthal said.\n\n\u201cThe bulk of the information about Lee that\u2019s out there is really seen through the lens of him having enormous success, and this was all at a time in his life where he didn\u2019t have that success.\u201d\n\nBernthal said playing a real-life character involved equal parts research and using his imagination to form what Iacocca would have been like at that point in his life.\n\n\u201cI use my dad as a real inspiration for that role, and the qualities that I really believe had driven my father,\u201d he said. \u201cI play a lot of super muscular, ultra-masculine men, and I feel like Lee Iacocca is no different. It\u2019s just that his super powers are his loyalty and his integrity and his ethics, rather than his ability to fight and master weapons.\u201d\n\nStoryteller\n\nBernthal said Small Engine Repair, a movie in which he starred and produced with John Pollono, will be released later this year, and marks his first credit as a producer. He said he also is working on his first writing project, a TV series, and he plans his first turn as a director next year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a storyteller, I love telling stories, I love being a part of telling someone else\u2019s story, and I\u2019m really excited for what the future holds in acting, producing, directing and in writing,\u201d he said. I\u2019ve really fallen in love with writing, and I\u2019m really looking forward to getting my projects out there,\u201d he said.\n\nGhost Recon 4 is available now on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC. Ford v Ferrari is scheduled to hit U.S. theaters Nov. 15.", "description": "Oct. 21 (UPI) \u2014 Actor Jon Bernthal is transitioning from the virtual world of video games, playing the villain in Ubisoft\u2019s Ghost Recon 4, to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
