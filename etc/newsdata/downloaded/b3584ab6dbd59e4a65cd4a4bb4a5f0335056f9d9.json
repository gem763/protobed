a court heard today.\n\nBen Lacomba contacted Kent Police more than 24 hours after mum-of-five Sarah Wellgreen had disappeared from the home they shared in New Ash Green, Kent, in October last year.\n\nIn two emergency calls on October 11 and lasting 40 minutes, the 39-year-old spoke calmly as he described how he had woken at the four-bedroom property the previous morning and realised the 46-year-old beautician was missing.\n\nHer phones and purse were still at the house and her Hyundai car was parked outside.\n\nA jury at Woolwich Crown Court, London, listened to the initial 999 call and then subsequent 'high priority' call in which Lacomba detailed Sarah's 'complicated and messy' lifestyle.\n\n(Image: JIM BENNETT)\n\nHe said she had up to seven phones, and claimed she had been stalked and assaulted at work.\n\nHe also told the operator that her on/off partner at the time Neil James was 'paranoid' and on one occasion had put a tracker on Sarah's phone.\n\nThe court also heard of the fruitless attempts made by Mr James and several members of Sarah's family, including her mother Ann Reid and her 22-year-old son Lewis Burdett, to contact her throughout October 10.\n\nHer phone was going to voicemail and there was no activity on WhatsApp or her Facebook account, the court heard.\n\nAt one stage Mr James sent a message to his girlfriend asking 'Are you alive?'\n\nHe and Lewis also contacted Lacomba in their desperate bid to track Sarah down and said they would be contacting police to search for her.\n\nAt the start of his call on the morning of October 11 Lacomba, who denies murder, told the operator: \"She hasn't gone missing before but her, erm, she's got a bit of a weird life let's put it that way.\"\n\n(Image: Ferrari Press Agency)\n\nHe described how they shared the house for the sake of their children but that Sarah was 'sort of like seeing a few blokes' other than Mr James, adding 'and so it looks like she's cheating on him'.\n\nLacomba described how Sarah split her time between living in the family home, at Mr James's home in Farnham, Surrey, and in Portsmouth where she worked for Puresun beauty salon.\n\nHe said she had told him that Mr James, who himself had children from previous relationships, 'put a tracker on her phone'.\n\n\"He's really paranoid about her, like where she, like he doesn't trust her and that...he's always like well just like accusing her of stuff like,\" added Lacomba.\n\n\"She said both his relationships with the kids' mums is poor, erm, like they both cheated on him.\"\n\nLacomba also claimed one of Mr James's former partners was also stalking Sarah, sending her photos of her car when she was staying at his house.\n\nIn a series of questions from the operator, he said Sarah had not left any sign that she was likely to harm herself or any mental health problems.\n\nWhen asked whether he had \"any idea\" of her whereabouts, he replied \"No I don't\", before adding after a pause of several seconds \"That's why I'm phoning you.\"\n\nThe operator also asked: \"Is there a reason that she may have gone missing?\n\n\"Anything going on that might be upsetting or any reason that you know of that she might go missing at all?\"\n\nLacomba replied: \"Like I said like, I, I, nothing, well obviously I, I, I find out about like her sort of seeing quite a few blokes sort of thing, erm...\"\n\nHe then spoke of how Sarah had been slapped and scratched by a work colleague, and then pinned to a wall the same colleague's boyfriend.\n\nLacomba said this incident had occurred just four days before he had gone missing and been reported to police.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nLacomba denies murder, claiming he went to bed on October 9 and woke to find Sarah missing at 7am the next day.\n\nHowever, the prosecution allege he murdered her and then disposed of her body \"in a calculated manner, designed to avoid detection\".\n\nIt is said he was motivated by the potential loss of the home they shared and having only limited access to their children as a result.\n\nAt the time she disappeared Sarah had landed a new job with a better salary and was in the process of buying him out of the property.\n\nEarlier the court heard how, having gone to bed shortly after returning home at 8pm on October 9, she sent numerous messages to Mr James and two other male friends, Anthony Garnham and Joe Eleini.\n\nIn one message to Mr James she spoke of how 'a huge weight' had been lifted from her after securing her new job.\n\nReferring to Lacomba, she told Mr James: \"The fat t**t ( Lacomba) said ''Oh that means you won't get benefits for the kids' so he asked to claim them. WTF.'\n\nAsked by Mr James why she went to bed so early she replied: \"I don't like to sit downstairs with Ben so I go to bed.\"\n\nIn the same conversation she added: \"I told him that I know he claims working tax credits and they have given him a lump sum. He's been very quiet since I got back...the truth hurts.\"\n\nIn a further message to Mr Eleini they arranged to meet the following Tuesday (Oct 16) for a 'play date'.\n\nShe then added in one of her very final messages sent at about 10pm: \"There is always something to look forward to you just need to open your eyes a bit more and dream X\" .\n\nLacomba claimed Sarah had switched the CCTV off at their home the night she vanished so he \"wouldn't know who she was going out with or where\".\n\nHe also said his ex-partner had wanted them to get back together, and would 'absolutely not' have left her children.\n\nThe case continues.", "description": "Mum-of-five Sarah Wellgreen was reported missing by the father of two of her children Ben Lacomba in 'calm' 999 call", "authors": ["Julia Roberts", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Jim Bennett", "Ferrari Press Agency", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13804223.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Missing-woman-Sarah-Wellgreen.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
