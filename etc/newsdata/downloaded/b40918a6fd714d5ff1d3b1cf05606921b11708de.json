Namely, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky was urged to make a deal with Putin, pressured \u201cto play ball\u201d with respect to providing or manufacturing compromising materials about Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and essentially tasked with concocting \u201cthe evidence\u201d to disprove the well-established fact that the Democratic National Committee server was hacked by Russian intelligence agents in 2016.\n\nThe unconscionable demand for Ukraine to make \u201ca deal\u201d with an invader\u2014 that\u2019s annexed and occupied its territory and continues to fuel an ongoing armed conflict that claimed over 13,000 lives\u2014 would mean a surrender of Ukraine\u2019s national interests for the benefit of the Kremlin. It would also lead to the lifting of sanctions against Russia for its aggression in Ukraine. Casting doubt on Russia\u2019s involvement in the hack of the DNC server would potentially lead to the lifting sanctions against Russia for its election meddling and other malign activities.", "description": "Prominent figures on Russian TV have been openly putting out the same ideas that we now know the American president was privately pursuing.", "authors": ["Julia Davis"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569585919/190926-Davis-Trump-Ukraine-tease_vck4al", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
