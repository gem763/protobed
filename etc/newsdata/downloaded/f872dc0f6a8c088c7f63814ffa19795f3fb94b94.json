And they should. But, at the same time, they should be wary of something else: While the national number drops, Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortions are staying steady.\n\nA new report by the Guttmacher Institute finds that the national abortion rate has dropped to its lowest point since 1973, the year the Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide with its Roe v. Wade decision. The research group, once affiliated with Planned Parenthood, compared past reports from 2011 and 2014 with new data for 2017.\n\n\u201cThe 2017 rate of 13.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15\u201344 is the lowest recorded since abortion was legalized nationally,\u201d the report by Rachel K. Jones, Elizabeth Witwer, and Jenna Jerman read.\n\nThe number of abortions also decreased, according to a related Guttmacher Institute policy review.\n\nFor the year 2017, Guttmacher counted a total of 862,320 abortions. That number represented a \u201c19% decline from 1,058,000 abortions in 2011\u201d and a \u201c7% decline since 2014,\u201d when 926,200 abortions were performed.\n\nBut Americans wouldn\u2019t know that if they looked at Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion numbers. They stand out in stark contrast by failing to reflect the steep decline.\n\nInstead of a 19% decline in abortions from 2011 to 2017, Planned Parenthood saw a decline less than one half of one percent with the number of abortions it provided from 2011 to 2017. According to Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual reports, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider performed 332,757 abortions for fiscal year 2017 \u2013 2018. That\u2019s barely a decline from 2011 \u2013 2012, when it performed 333,964 abortions. Barely, meaning a decrease of 0.36%.\n\nIn other words, Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion business is doing just fine \u2013 so far. But the organization is still gearing up for a fight. Former Planned Parenthood president Leana Wen said she was dismissed from her position in July because she didn\u2019t prioritize abortion enough.\n\n\u201cThe new Board leadership has determined that the priority of Planned Parenthood moving forward is to double down on abortion rights advocacy,\u201d she wrote in a statement at the time. \u201cWith the landscape changing dramatically in the last several months and the right to safe, legal abortion care under attack like never before, I understand the shift in the Board\u2019s prioritization.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a scary thought that Wen didn\u2019t do enough to push that issue. Unlike her predecessors, she recognized abortion as Planned Parenthood\u2019s \u201ccore mission\u201d and oversaw her organization as it launched campaigns to advertise abortion as health care, sued the Trump administration over Title X funding, and mobilized celebrities, politicians, and business executives to support its agenda.\n\nHer replacement, Planned Parenthood\u2019s acting president Alexis McGill Johnson, also calls abortion \u201cone of our core services.\u201d\n\nWhen CBS reporter Kate Smith dared to ask her in July \u201cIs there a scenario where you would discontinue abortion services in order to make everything else that you do easier?\u201d Johnson responded immediately, \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d\n\nWhile Planned Parenthood claims that abortion consists of only 3% of its services, it allows abortion to influence its direction 100%. The abortion giant has refused millions in federal family-planning funding rather than give up performing or referring abortions. Former Planned Parenthood workers, like Abby Johnson, have stressed that Planned Parenthood has an \u201cabortion quota.\u201d Other former abortion employees from Johnson\u2019s group, And Then There Were None, agree. In 2017, one former worker recognized Planned Parenthood as an abortion \u201csales team,\u201d while another stressed that it has \u201cone agenda\" which is \u201cto end a pregnancy.\u201d\n\nBut pushing unlimited, unrestricted abortion not only insults women wounded by abortion, but also dismisses the fact that poll after poll reveals that the majority of Americans want abortion restrictions. That includes, more recently, a June NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.\n\nAmericans should cheer the overall decrease in abortion, even though, to the pro-life movement, 862,320 abortions is 862,320 too many. Abortion activists and Planned Parenthood see numbers, when each should have a name.", "description": "Americans on both sides of the abortion debate are applauding .09/20/2019 1:06:31AM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Yoder", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/193/c37f0f56-9245-469b-94af-46171ad41c50.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
