I didn\u2019t like what was going on. I felt it in my stomach \u2026 It\u2019s a crazy day, and a sad day for football.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAnd then there's John Barnes.\n\nSome critics argue that the man who suffered horrendous racial abuse as a player has turned from an eloquent analyst to a deliberate controversialist who goes against the mainstream view to stand out from the crowd.\n\nBut on this most complex of subjects the man who said \"If every racist who came to football was silenced, football stadiums would still be full of racists\u201d is still to me its most profound thinker. The one marching to a different drum beat but playing the right tune.\n\nOn the morning of the Sofia game, Barnes was quoted defending English football's comparative lack of bigotry: \u201cYes, you have people shouting racist abuse and throwing bananas on the field, and there are issues regarding the number of black coaches and managers in the game, but which other industry allows a young black boy the exact same opportunity as a young white boy?\u201d\n\nHis point being, look at other highly-paid professions like the law, journalism, politics, the civil service etc., and you'll find the overwhelming majority of jobs belong to white people.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nWhich may give context to Collymore's refusal to appear on Good Morning Britain, to discuss the events in Sofia, on the grounds he would have felt like the token black face invited on to mainstream TV for a two-minute soundbite whenever racism rears is head.\n\nHe'd argue where are the other invites? Where are the other black faces?\n\nIt so happens research into ITV's diversity by a Sunday newspaper the previous day showed that out of 18 hours of output, just 24 minutes were presented by a non-white broadcaster, ITN newsreader Nina Hossain.\n\nListen to the complete lack of self-awareness from the holder of the top job in the land, white, Old Etonian Boris Johnson, who leapt on to the England bandwagon by demanding UEFA drives racism \u201cout of football once and for all.\u201d\n\nA Prime Minister on record for mocking Africans as \u201cpicaninnies with water melon smiles\u201d and likening muslim women in burkas to post boxes and bank robbers.\n\n(Image: Dan Kitwood)\n\nThis country should feel proud of its national football team for their brave, possibly game-changing actions in Sofia on Monday.\n\nBut before patting ourselves on the back too much we should remember that taking a stand against discrimination in football grounds is all very well.\n\nBut when it flourishes unchecked outside it, as the surge in our country's hate-crime figures show, then the likes of Barnes and Collymore are spot-on when they argue the root problem is being white-washed.", "description": "The issue of racism in football is still prevalent in the United Kingdom and we must tackle it as soon as possible", "authors": ["Brian Reade", "Image", "Eddie Keogh For The Fa Rex", "Getty Images", "Bbc", "Dan Kitwood"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586953.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bulgaria-v-England-UEFA-Euro-2020-Qualifying-Group-A-Football-Vasil-Levski-National-Stadium-Sofi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
