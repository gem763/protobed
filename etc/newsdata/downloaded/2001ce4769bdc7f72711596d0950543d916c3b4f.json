It also raises questions as to whether Giuliani\u2019s shadow diplomacy efforts over the next year were also an effort to drum up business for his consulting group.\n\nTymoshenko was hoping Giuliani could broker a meeting with Trump and perhaps even arrange a picture with him, neither of which happened. But a person familiar with their interactions said Giuliani also wanted something in return: business.\n\nGiuliani disputes the purpose of the meeting, which was included in disclosure forms filed by Tymoshenko\u2019s lobbyists, telling CNN he never offered to work for Tymoshenko or enter into any sort of business relationship with her.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics Giuliani-Meeting-Tymoshenko-Lobbying Index.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
