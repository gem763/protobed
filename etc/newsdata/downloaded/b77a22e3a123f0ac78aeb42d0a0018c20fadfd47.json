Debbie Wasserman Schultz accused President Trump and acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli on Wednesday of implementing immigration policy in service of a \u201cwhite supremacist ideology.\u201d\n\nThe accusations came during a hearing of the House Oversight Committee on immigration policy.\n\n\u201cYou and Mr. Trump don\u2019t want anyone who looks or talks or differently than Caucasian Americans to be allowed into this country,\u201d Wasserman Schultz began. A staffer sitting behind her was captured on video as her eyes widened in shock.\n\n\u201cYou have demonstrated that you will pursue this heinous white supremacist ideology at all costs,\u201d said Wasserman Schultz. Cuccinelli answered that neither he nor the President was a white supremacist.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s false,\u201d Cuccinelli said, calling Wasserman Schultz\u2019s statements \u201cdefamatory.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli had been summoned to the hearing to discuss the Trump administration\u2019s decision to temporarily stop granting deportation deferments for illegal aliens receiving life-saving treatment in the U.S.\n\nRepresentative Ayanna Pressley (D., Ohio) also entered into a heated exchange with Cuccinelli over who was responsible for the decision, himself or White House officials. Cuccinelli repeatedly asserted that he made the decision and that no White House official was involved.\n\nTrump had considered appointing Cuccinelli secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. However, Senator Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) said the idea was a non-starter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my understanding that the existing law would not permit him to\u201d lead the organization, Grassley said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you get around that.\u201d Grassley was referring to current laws that govern succession rules within the federal government.\n\nOn Tuesday, a top Border Patrol official warned that illegal immigration could hit crisis levels if courts keep blocking Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\n\n\u201cWe will go back, mark the words, we will go back to the crisis level that we had before,\u201d said chief of law enforcement operations for the Border Patrol Brian Hastings. \u201cIt is kind of a new norm. We\u2019re at risk at any time.\u201d", "description": "Rep.
