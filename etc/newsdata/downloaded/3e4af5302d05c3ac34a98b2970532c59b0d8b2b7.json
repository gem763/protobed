I've seen a huge gap in the market.'\n\nFirst, it will be launched in California, where Petra recently sold her home \u2013 the largest in Los Angeles \u2013 for a record \u00a395million. 'America created customer services and it seems that there's very little of it anymore,' Palmer laments. 'I want to base this company on keeping out sharks.'\n\nFor I can reveal that Palmer (left) has become so used to servants attending to his every wish night and day that he's decided to make his own fortune from hired help\n\nThe couple have bought a new property in LA and Palmer brags of the business: 'We're currently trialling it out in own home, which not many agencies can do. We do have a lot of house staff ourselves.'\n\nAfter they announced their engagement, Petra's billionaire father groaned: 'I told her I don't know what the hurry is...I don't understand the reason.'\n\nBefore Palmer, 35, began courting Petra, 30, the electrician turned vintage car salesman from Harlow, Essex, was noted for his habit of wearing shoes without socks and for his friendship with Jay Rutland, the flashy husband of Petra's sister, Tamara.\n\nSince his relationship with Petra, 30, he has been set up in business in an art gallery in LA.\n\nIn an interview last November, Petra explained of their meeting: 'I randomly bumped into him when he came to LA to visit Jay. I honestly thought I was going to be celibate or turn into a lesbian. You meet someone when you least expect it or want it.'\n\nShe added, cautiously: 'I would marry again, as I don't believe you should say one experience will be like another experience in life. I'd get a prenup again, though.'\n\nHas the BBC found the ideal successor to musical maestro Jools Holland?\n\nFellow pianist Jamie Cullum will co-present an episode of BBC2 music show Later. . . With Jools Holland next month, and insiders tell me he would be ideal to take over when the veteran host hangs up his microphone.\n\n'With his musician credentials and appeal to young people, how long before it's Later. . . With Jamie Cullum?' asks one. This series is the first time in 27 years that Holland, 61, has had to share the spotlight with co-hosts.\n\nA BBC spokesman confirms that Cullum, married to model Sophie Dahl, will be a 'co-host' but insists: 'Jamie is not being groomed to take over from Jools.'\n\nThe smart set's talking about... Soho heiress's battle with booze India Rose James (pictured) inherited a sizeable chunk of her grandfather Paul Raymond's \u00a31 billion property empire when he died in 2008, but she wasn't also handed happiness India Rose James inherited a sizeable chunk of her grandfather Paul Raymond's \u00a31 billion property empire when he died in 2008, but she wasn't also handed happiness. The 27-year-old Soho Estates heiress has spoken for the first time about her battle with booze. 'I've been sober for 19 months and it's getting easier, but you shouldn't really say that because at any time you can relapse,' she tells me at a 'pop-up' shop selling Montblanc luggage designed by Philip Colbert in Spitalfields, East London. 'A lot of people have been saying how great I look now that I've given up alcohol and it's been so encouraging. I feel so much better.' Together with her sister Fawn James, India Rose inherited 80 per cent of the fortune of Raymond, who made money from pornography before moving into property. She has a three-year-old daughter, Saffi, with her ex-boyfriend, The Kooks' guitarist Hugh Harris. Giving up drink has made her a better mother, she admits. 'I can't have a hangover and look after a child at the same time.'\n\n(Very) modern manners\n\nAs a dedicated follower of fashion, style arbiter Nicky Haslam is having second thoughts about donating his old togs to charity shops.\n\n'Unwisely, I always get rid of some of my clothes,' Nicky tells me at the Catholic Herald Book Awards at Brown's Hotel in Mayfair.\n\n'The minute I give them away, they become fashionable again and I have to buy them again from charity shops I've sent them to.'\n\nNicky adds: 'I wish I had more space in my wardrobes for clothes. But it's rather fun getting rid of them; I give them to my nephews, too \u2014 they think I'm the cool uncle.'", "description": "EDEN CONFIDENTIAL: Erstwhile used car salesman Sam Palmer has not taken long to become accustomed to life with \u00a3230m Formula 1 heiress Petra Ecclestone.", "authors": ["Richard Eden For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/00/19906924-0-image-a-32_1571440622500.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
