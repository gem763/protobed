(Niklas Elmedhed/Nobel Media)\n\nThe Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded Wednesday to John B. Goodenough, M. Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino \u201cfor the development of lithium-ion batteries.\"\n\n\u201cWe have gained access to a technical revolution\u201d said Sara Snogerup Linse, a chemistry professor and member of the award committee, sweeping her finger at the reporters gathered at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Lithium-ion batteries provide energy to mobile phones, pacemakers and electric cars.\n\n\u201cThis is a highly charged story with tremendous potential,\u201d said committee member Olof Ramstr\u00f6m, a professor of chemistry. These batteries are increasingly used to complement power sources that fluctuate, such as solar and wind energy.\n\nIn the 1970s, Whittingham, born in the United Kingdom and a professor at Binghamton University in New York, discovered a material, titanium disulfide, that can house ions of the element lithium for a battery.\n\nGerman-born Goodenough, a 97-year-old professor at the University of Texas at Austin, is the oldest person to receive a Nobel Prize, the committee said. He improved the potential of these batteries in 1980 by switching the type of metal in the cathode end of the batteries. Yoshino, of Japan, developed the first commercial lithium-ion battery five years later when he swapped reactive lithium in the anode for a carbon-based material, petroleum coke.\n\nTogether, these discoveries led to a \u201clightweight, hardwearing battery that could be charged hundreds of times before its performance deteriorated,\u201d the committee said in a news release.\n\n2019 Chemistry Laureate John Goodenough doubled the lithium battery\u2019s potential, creating the right conditions for a vastly more powerful and useful battery.#NobelPrize pic.twitter.com/ygivR7hySG \u2014 The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 9, 2019\n\nOf the more than 600 Nobel Prize medals in science awarded, 20 have gone to women. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences tweaked the award process in 2019 to encourage more diversity; this boosted the number of nominated female scientists, the academy\u2019s secretary general recently told Nature. Despite this, the 2019 science laureates are all men.\n\nThe recipients will evenly split a monetary award of around $900,000, and receive gold medals large enough to arouse the suspicions of airport security.\n\nRead more:\n\nNobel Prize in medicine awarded for discovery of how cells sense oxygen\n\nNobel Prize in physics awarded for research on exoplanets and the structure of the universe\n\nShe made the discovery, but a man got the Nobel", "description": "Three scientists won the award for their development of rechargeable batteries.", "authors": ["Ben Guarino", "Reporter Covering The Practice", "Culture Of Science", "October At Am", "Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section.
