Facebook and Twitter make it much easier to get lots of people into the streets fast. But when everyone has a digital megaphone, it is much harder for any leader to aggregate enough authority not just to build a coherent set of demands but, more important, to make compromises on them, at the right time, to transform street energy into new laws.\n\nSo, the Hong Kong protesters proudly proclaim they have \u201cno leader\u201d and insist on their five crowdsourced demands \u2014 and \u201cnot one less.\u201d Those demands include universal suffrage to elect the city\u2019s administrators, an investigation of police brutality and amnesty for arrested protesters.\n\nBut no movement will get 100 percent of what it wants, especially in Hong Kong, which is actually one country, three systems. There\u2019s Beijing, the sovereign power. There\u2019s the conservative pro-Beijing Hong Kongers, who dominate the local administration and accept the limited democracy rules inherited from Britain. And there\u2019s the more urbanized, full-democracy-aspiring, internet-savvy youth in the streets.\n\nThe only possible outcome is a compromise. But as the South China Morning Post columnist Alex Lo argued in a Sept. 11 article, Hong Kong protesters are being hobbled by the same social networks that got them their large crowds: Because there is no leadership, there is no ability to cut a deal, and anyone who tries to compromise will get torched online. These modern movements are crowdsourced but also crowd-enforced, and that\u2019s intimidating for anyone who wants to make a deal.\n\n\u201cWorldwide trends usually take a few years to reach Hong Kong,\u201d wrote Lo, and \u201cour social media-driven revolution that has fueled the current unrest is no exception. \u2026 But from Gezi Park in Istanbul to Tahrir Square in Cairo, revolutions and rebellions driven by social media have all ended in failure.\u201d\n\nBecause Hong Kong\u2019s protests \u201cencompass and amplify practically every major grievance people have about their government, society and China,\u201d Lo added, \u201cit\u2019s impossible to bridge disagreements and present a viable political program. The only common denominator, the lowest, is that everyone hates China.\u201d\n\nMy view: Social networks and cybertools are making inefficient authoritarian regimes more frail, because the people now have more tools to communicate and take on the state. See: Egypt, Jordan, Turkey and Russia. But they\u2019re making efficient authoritarians even more efficient. See: China. And they are making democracies ungovernable, because they not only facilitate the \u201cend of truth\u201d but also \u201cthe end of compromise.\u201d See: America, Brexit and Hong Kong.", "description": "Building a movement was easier than finding a way to negotiate a compromise without leaders.", "authors": ["Thomas L.
