He urged viewers to visit Joe30330. No such site existed. Aids had told him to tell viewers to text Joe30330 it later emerged.\n\nAll the same, Mr Biden remains the steady frontrunner over the nine remaining candidates to take on Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
