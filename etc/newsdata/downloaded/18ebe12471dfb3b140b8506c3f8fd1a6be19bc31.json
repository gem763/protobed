VW said it was confident those allegations would prove groundless.\n\nThis may be a landmark lawsuit - and in terms of the sheer number of claimants, it's certainly attention grabbing. But it may not be the biggest concern for Volkswagen right now.\n\nUnless there is a settlement, the legal process is likely to take take years - VW expects it to take at least four. Even if they win, car owners will have to go back to court to get compensation.\n\nMeanwhile, VW's chairman and chief executive are both fighting criminal charges for alleged market manipulation linked to the diesel scandal.\n\nVolkswagen itself is facing the possibility of hefty fines from the EU, after being accused of colluding with other manufacturers to delay the introduction of emissions control technology.\n\nIt's safe to say its lawyers are already keeping pretty busy at the moment. And in the meantime, the company is trying to turn itself into a leader in the market for electric cars.\n\nAgainst that background, the group lawsuit may seem for the moment like just another irritation.", "description": "Germany's first mass legal action begins as 450,000 owners of diesel cars take on the company.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AFFC/production/_109025054_gettyimages-465774308.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
