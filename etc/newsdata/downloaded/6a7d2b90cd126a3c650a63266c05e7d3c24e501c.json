Behaviorally, they act very similarly as well, particularly in terms of reproduction \u2014 both males and females invest pretty equally in raising their chicks.\u201d\n\nThe London aquarium said the genderless chick may later join its breeding program depending on the \u201cgender its biology determines.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
