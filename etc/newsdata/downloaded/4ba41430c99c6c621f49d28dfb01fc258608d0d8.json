Let's set a new bullish strategy for this money center bank and Action Alerts PLUS holding.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of JPM, below, we can see that the recent new price high on the stock has refreshed an uptrend from late December. Prices started their newest rally in August/September when the broad market was weak. Prices survived a test of the rising 200-day moving average line and JPM gapped above the 50-day line in early September and retested the 50-day line earlier this month.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a pattern of higher lows from December and a new high for the move up will help to confirm the new price highs of this week. The trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator just crossed to the upside from above the zero line for a new buy signal.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of JPM, below, we can see that the price of the bank has been in a long consolidation from early 2018. Prices are now moving above this pattern and starting what could be a powerful advance. JPM is above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is steady and if it turns higher it will only add to the bullish setup. The MACD oscillator on this long time frame is in a bullish configuration above the zero line.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of JPM, below,we can see the breakout trade at $120.05 and the potential upside price target of $148.\n\nBottom-line strategy: I have not been a fan of the banks for a long time but JPM is making me into a born again bull. Go long JPM at current levels, risk to $115 and look for gains to the $150 area by year-end.", "description": "Get Your Checkbook, JPMorgan Chase Has Launched a New Uptrend...JPM", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Get Your Checkbook", "Jpmorgan Chase Has Launched A New Uptrend", "Jpm Is Making Me Into A Born Again Bull.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Timothy Collins", "Ed Ponsi", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass", "Jim Cramer"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/6e7d7c83-a461-11e7-98b5-052e44947708.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
