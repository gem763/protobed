REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nThe FTSE 100 .FTSE fell 0.3% with financials and mining stocks dragging the most, while the FTSE 250 midcaps index .FTMC shed 0.6%.\n\nThe banking index .FTNMX8350 lost nearly 1%, tracking a fall in British bond yields, after weaker-than-expected German data showed the private sector contracting for the first time in more than six years.\n\nFurther dampening sentiment in the sector was a note by JPMorgan saying it expects downward risks for UK domestic banks in most Brexit scenarios.\n\nGlobal miners such as Glencore (GLEN.L) and Antofagasta (ANTO.L) also weakened as a lack of clarity in U.S.-China trade talks dented metals prices.\n\n\u201cTrade tensions between the two largest economies in the world are having an impact around the global, and the dreadful manufacturing figures from Germany this morning is a great example of how the problem spills out beyond the U.S. and China,\u201d CMC Markets analyst David Madden said.\n\nThe FTSE 100, whose constituents bring in more than two-thirds of their profits from abroad, saw its steepest monthly fall this year in August when trade tensions between the United States and China escalated.\n\nWhile the index has benefited from the weakness in the pound for most of 2019 as a painful Brexit process plays out, recent steps by lawmakers in preventing a no-deal Brexit have brought gains for the currency and in turn weighed on exporters.\n\nThe FTSE 100 has gained just 8.9% so far in the year, well behind its European counterpart\u2019s 15.4% rise.\n\nThe collapse of Thomas Cook spurred buying in tour operator TUI (TUIT.L), airlines Ryanair (RYA.L) and easyJet (EZJ.L) and British Airways owner IAG (ICAG.L), as investors anticipated the tour operator\u2019s closure would cut capacity in the saturated European holiday market.\n\n\u201cSuch a tragic collapse\u2026 leaves plenty of money on the table for its sector peers, a fact that hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by investors,\u201d Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell said.\n\nThe FTSE 350 travel and leisure index .FTNMX5750 rose to its highest level in almost a year.\n\nMarks & Spencer (MKS.L) lost 3.2%, on its first day as a mid-cap constituent and after the abrupt departure of its finance chief on Saturday.\n\nIt is the first time the 135-year old retailer has been relegated from the FTSE 100 since the index\u2019s inception in 1984.\n\nThomas Cook share performance vs other UK tour and related companies: here", "description": "London's FTSE 100 index slipped on Monday as weak German economic data weighed on banking shares, offsetting a surge in travel operators and airlines after the collapse of the world's oldest travel firm Thomas Cook.", "authors": ["Yadarisa Shabong", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432863351&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0EZ", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
