of Google\u2019s birthday has changed over the years without much explanation. Until 2005 the website celebrated its birthday on September 7, supposedly marking the day it became an incorporated company.\n\nBut the company actually filed incorporation papers on September 4, 1998, though it has never used this date as its birthday. Since 2005 it has marked its birthday on September 8, September 26 and, more recently, September 27.\n\n\u201cWhen is Google\u2019s birthday? I\u2019m not sure even we know,\u201d wrote Google employee Ryan Germick in 2013, adding: \u201cStill, while there\u2019s some differing opinions about when to bust out the candles and cake, one fun fact is that our first Doodle was posted even before Google was officially incorporated (30 August, 1998 vs 4 September, 1998).\u201d", "description": "Google is celebrating its 21st birthday with a special Doodle.
