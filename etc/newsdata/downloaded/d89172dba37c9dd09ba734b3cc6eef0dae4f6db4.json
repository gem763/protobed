Some of that speculation hinges, of course, on the outright blaming of Iran for Saturday's strikes by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a tweet. Houthi rebels, backed by Iran in the Saudi-led battle in Yemen, have claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying more would come.\n\nTruth be told, it's Trump, not Pompeo, who will decide what happens to the sanctions on Iran. Nearly 24 hours after the attacks, the president, interestingly, had not tweeted his own response.\n\nThe shut Saudi oil facilities, together with their production, could bounce back in no time. But what happens to the price of oil is another matter. This is especially so with the Saudis desperate now to boost crude prices in any way to drive valuations up for the IPO of their state oil firm Aramco.\n\nended the week down nearly 3%, its sharpest weekly slide since mid-July. fell 2% on the week, its most in five weeks. Expect a major rally Monday on the Saudi news, and greater volatility after that as the Iranians have vowed to maximize their own production if they get a break from sanctions.\n\nAs for gold, the big story is still Thursday\u2019s rate cut and quantitative easing announced by the European Central Bank, and what that means for the Federal Reserve\u2019s own monetary policy when it meets Sept 17-18. But if oil gets a big pop on Monday, expect gold to rally too on safe-haven buying.\n\nEnergy Review\n\nCompared to the fanfare generated by the two outsize U.S. crude draws at end-August, Wednesday\u2019s weekly dataset from the EIA barely brought joy to oil bulls.\n\nAfter the latest 7 million barrel draw drove WTI to 6-week highs of $58.29 and Brent to $63.26, the market sunk in reaction to the ouster of Bolton, the Trump administration\u2019s biggest hawk on Iran.\n\nOn Thursday, new Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told the OPEC+ producer alliance, which includes Russia, that the kingdom would continue to over-comply voluntarily with oil output cuts agreed by the group.\n\nEarlier, in its monthly report on Wednesday, OPEC forecast that demand for its own crude will average 29.4 million barrels per day in 2020, down 1.2 million bpd from this year. U.S. crude has become the No. 1 export competitor to OPEC oil this year, shipping a steady 3 million bpd or so in recent weeks.\n\nChairing the panel meeting of the OPEC alliance, Prince Abdulaziz said Riyadh\u2019s October production would be 9.890 million, and that deeper output cuts would be discussed at OPEC\u2019s regular meeting in November.\n\nOPEC aside, the Paris-based International Energy Agency also warned of a global oil glut on Thursday, saying risk premiums and supply threats were significantly cut as tensions in the Middle East Gulf hav eased and oil industry operations appeared to be normalizing.\n\nEnergy Calendar Ahead\n\nMonday, Sept 16\n\nGenscape Cushing crude stockpile estimates (private data)\n\nTuesday, Sept 17\n\nweekly report on oil stockpiles.\n\nWednesday, Sept 18\n\nEIA weekly report on\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy decision\n\nThursday, Sept 19\n\nEIA\n\nFriday, Sept 20\n\nweekly rig count\n\nPrecious Metals Review\n\nThe ECB delivered a rate cut as expected, but gold still couldn\u2019t shine last week as perceived progress in U.S.-Sino negotiations - whatever that meant - landed a fresh blow on the yellow metal.\n\nfor December delivery settled at $1,499.50 per ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, losing 1.1% on the week. It was gold futures\u2019 third straight weekly drop and biggest weekly decline since April.\n\n, reflective of trades in bullion, also remained below the key $1,500 level. It settled Friday\u2019s trade at 1,488.74, down about 1.2% on the week for its worst week since late March.\n\nGlobal economic worries took a back seat during the week after trade concessions from both the United States and China and President Donald Trump's latest comments that he was potentially open to an interim trade deal with China.\n\n\"It doesn't mean we will have a trade deal, but maybe a possibility that the U.S. and China might postpone the new tariffs and possibly even relax some of the tariffs that are already in place,\" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York, was quoted saying on Reuters. \"It's a market of hope. A hope of a cosmetic resolution.\"\n\nJust on Thursday, gold appeared to be on a new breakout higher after the European Central Bank cut its deposit rate to a record low of -0.5%, while promising that rates would stay low for longer and said it would restart bond purchases at a rate of 20 billion euros a month from Nov. 1.\n\nThe Eurozone action pressures the U.S. Federal Reserve, which holds its meets its monthly policy meeting Sept 17-18, to respond with dovish measures of its own kind.\n\nBut the notion of improving U.S.-Sino trade relations, along with stronger-than-expected U.S. retail sales and consumer sentiment data for August, stopped gold from breaking new ground Friday. The better economic data, particularly, dents hopes for a 50 basis-point cut in Fed rates next week. According to Investing.com\u2019s , the market still sees an 78.5% chance of a quarter-point cut by the U.S. central bank.\n\n\u201cSignaling of additional cuts this year will be the main driver\u201d for gold, TD Securities said in a note on precious metals shared with Investing.com.\n\n\u201cA failure to leave the door open for further easing, and the dot plot not showing increasing calls for 75bps of cuts this year could be taken as a disappointment for the yellow metal,\u201d the Canadian bank and broking group said.\n\nBut while there could be disappointment in the near term, any dips should be shallow, TD Securities added. \u201cUnderlying economic weakness, dovish central bank tilt, and shortage of safe haven assets still suggests the path of least resistance for gold and friends is higher.\u201d", "description": "Energy & Precious Metals - Weekly Review and Calendar Ahead", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE530SG_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
