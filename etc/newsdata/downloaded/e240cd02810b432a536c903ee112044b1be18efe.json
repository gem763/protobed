A cavernoma is a cluster of abnormal blood vessels on the brain, and in rarer cases the spine, which can measure from a few millimetres to several centimetres. Symptoms may include seizures, headaches, dizziness, slurred speech, double vision and tremors, memory and concentration difficulties. According to the Cavernoma Alliance UK, a cavernoma can get bigger over time, but the growth is not cancerous and it does not spread to other parts of the body. A cavernoma often does not cause symptoms, but when symptoms do occur they can include: bleeding (haemorrhage)\n\nfits (seizures)\n\nheadaches\n\nneurological problems, such as dizziness, slurred speech (dysarthria), double vision, balance problems and tremor\n\nweakness, numbness, tiredness, memory problems and difficulty concentrating\n\na type of stroke called a haemorrhagic stroke The severity and duration of symptoms can vary depending on the type of cavernoma and where it's located. Problems can occur if the cavernoma bleeds or presses on certain areas of the brain. The cells lining a cavernoma are often thinner than those that line normal blood vessels, which means they're prone to leaking blood. In most cases, bleeding is small \u2013 usually around half a teaspoonful of blood \u2013 and may not cause other symptoms. But severe haemorrhages can be life threatening and may lead to long-lasting problems. One person in 600 in the UK has a brain cavernoma without symptoms. Treatment depends on the position but removal is an option.\n\nShe said: 'It was a blow. Many clients were my friends and I hated letting them down. But it was taking all my energy, just to cope with everyday life.'\n\nDetermined to get to the bottom of the problem, Sandra started booking appointments with an ear, nose and throat specialist, who found nothing wrong.\n\nShe explained: 'But there was something going on, I just knew it. I became so anxious and stressed, my hair started falling out in clumps.'\n\nSandra said her doctor dismissed her completely, revealing: 'Eventually my ENT consultant said: 'Sandra, this is a busy clinic and you're taking up a lot of our time. Perhaps it's time to refer you for psychiatric help.'\n\nShe said she was 'crushed' by the suggestion it was all in her head, and sought a second opinion, but a new consultant couldn't explain my symptoms, either.\n\nBut by October 2014, her health had worsen.\n\nShe said: 'In addition to headaches and nausea, now I had a constant tingling down the left half of my face.\n\nShe added: 'Looking in the mirror, my mouth was drooping down slightly, on that side. The sight in my left eye was blurry.\n\n'I developed a tremor and had a constant tingling in my right foot and leg, which dragged slightly when I walked.\n\n'I was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy, but that couldn't explain why I was constantly shaking, and my foot had gone funny.'\n\nFinally, in January 2015, she went for an MRI scan, and a doctor revealed she had a cavernorma.\n\nHe told her it was a 'cluster of abnormal blood vessels in your brain stem', explaining: 'If you could see it, it would look a bit like a raspberry.'\n\nHe went on to tell her that the cavernoma was 'pressing against the left side of her brain and causing the symptoms she'd been having.'\n\nHe explained that her health issues had come from a sudden bleed from the cavernoma.\n\nShe said: 'I was shocked. It was a massive relief to get a diagnosis after all this time - but knowing there was an abnormality in my brain was alarming.'\n\nDespite considering an operation, the doctor told Sandra that the position of her cavernoma left her at risk of suffering a stroke, or ending up with paralysis from the neck down.\n\nShe said: 'Back home, I talked things over with my husband Stuart and our family. We decided the surgery was just too risky.\n\nThe second time that Sandra's cavernoma bled, her face collapsed, and she was barely able to eat or walk (pictured in 2015 after the bleed)\n\n'I'd have to live with my difficulties, and make the most of it. In fact, knowing what was wrong, I felt less anxious and my symptoms improved a little.'\n\nShe went on: 'I got involved with a support group, Cavernoma Alliance UK. It was wonderful to chat online with fellow patients who understood exactly what I was going through, because they'd been there, too.\n\n'I started organising fundraising events, with support from my lovely family and friends.'\n\nThrough the charity, she heard of a neurosurgeon, Mr Neil Kitchen, working at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, specialising in cavernomas.\n\nSandra and her husband decided that despite her health problems, the surgery posed too many risks (pictured, in 2015)\n\nAfter meeting the doctor, he agreed that, for the time being, it was safest to adopt a 'wait and see' approach.\n\nBut in September 2015, while prepping for a fundraising party at her home, she was relaxing in her garden when she suddenly started to feel dizzy and sick.\n\nShe said: 'Standing up, I couldn't walk straight - some force was pulling me over to the left hand side. Somehow I managed to get indoors, just before I was hit by a violent bout of vomiting.'\n\nShe phoned her daughter, who was so worried she drove straight over to her mother's home and immediately phoned 999.\n\nSandra went on to have surgery to remove her cavernoma in 2015 (pictured, the scar that was left after the operation)\n\nParamedics told her that she likely had food poisoning, and sent her home.\n\nBut 48 hours later, she still felt dreadful, and she was admitted to hospital, where tests and an MRI scan revealed another cavernoma bleed.\n\nShe revealed: 'This time it had affected my face, so I could barely open my mouth or chew my food.\n\n'My mobility was also compromised. My right side was numb. I could only shuffle a few steps, as long as I looked at the floor - if I lifted my head, I fell over.'\n\nHowever the cavernoma operation left her with nerve damage in her face, with physiotherapists hoped would be temporary (pictured, in 2017)\n\nWorried about what the future may bring, Sandra visited a close friend, who worked as a psychic.\n\nShe explained: 'She gave me a reading, saying: \"Sandra, you're going to get through this, and you'll be okay.\n\n\"Your mother-in-law Jean is at your side - when you need her, she'll be holding your hand.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, she was transferred to the Neurology Hospital, where Mr Kitchen told her it was time to have the surgery.\n\nSandra struggled to chew, swallow and blink after the cavernoma operation (pictured, in 2017)\n\nShe went on to have the operation, and said the belief that her mother-in-law Jean was there in spirit brought her calmness.\n\nShe said: 'I was in the theatre for four hours, but as soon as I woke from the anaesthetic, I felt better.\n\n'That awful sensation of pressure on my forehead and inside my ear, which had been making me sick and dizzy for so long, was gone.'\n\nShe was told by doctors they'd been successful in removing the whole of the cavernoma, but complications had affected the nerves in her face.\n\nSandra was given exercises to help with the movement in her face, and even started walking with a stick\n\nShe said: 'Now the left side was being pulled round towards the right. I struggled to chew food or swallow.\n\n'My left eye wasn't blinking along with the right, and it soon became dry and painful. I still couldn't walk normally, or in a straight line.\n\n'The first time I was strong enough to get to a bathroom, and look in the mirror, I was shocked: 'My face has gone out of shape!'\n\nBut physiotherapists hoped the damage would only be temporary, and gave Sandra facial exercises to help return the nerves and muscles to their proper place.\n\nDespite the challenges, Sandra said it was 'wonderful' to spend time with her family and do 'normal' things\n\nEight days after the op, she returned home to begin a gradual recovery.\n\nShe said: 'I knew it was going to take time. After all, I'd been poorly for so long, I couldn't expect to get better overnight.'\n\nShe added: 'It was wonderful to be able to enjoy simple pleasures like sitting with my children and three grandchildren, or watching television - things I hadn't felt well enough to do, for ages.'\n\n'Soon I was able to get rid of my walking frame, and use a walking stick instead.'\n\nSandra said she was delighted to take on simple pleasures, like enjoying lunch out with her husband Stuart (pictured in 2017)\n\nShe explained: 'I had a setback when an ulcer and scarring developed on my dry left eye, requiring a minor op.'\n\nSandra went on to have further surgery on her left eyelid, to help it close properly.\n\nBut she put her recovery on hold for two years when her own mother fell ill.\n\nShe said: 'Family and friends often commented: \"Sandra, we love the way you look at life. You're always so positive.\"\n\nSandra went on to have multiple surgeries over the years, but always kept her positive attitude which she credited with helping her through\n\nOver the years, her doctors talked to her about surgery to try and restore more symmetry to her face.\n\nBut before her mother passed away, she urged Sandra: 'Sandra, you've been through so much. Don't put yourself through any more.'\n\nAfter her mother's death in September 2018, she decided it was time to face surgery.\n\nIn April 2019, at Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, she underwent facial reanimation surgery, also known as a Labbe procedure.\n\nSandra underwent eye operations in order to help her to close her left eyelid, and restore some movement in her face (pictured, after the operation)\n\nDoctors made an incision in her scalp to gain access to the temporalis muscle. The muscle was freed from the skull to allow it to slide forward, then re-attached to the corner of her mouth.\n\nShe said: 'My face is still settling after the operation but the results have already been amazing.\n\nShe revealed: 'For the first time in years, I can breathe through two nostrils and that feels great. My eye is much less dry - I don't have to lubricate it so often.\n\n'My speech sounds clearer. My chewing ability has improved - I can eat a bigger range of foods, which should improve even further with physiotherapy.\n\nSandra continued to undergo surgery, including eye surgery in order to restore movement to her face\n\nOperations in the past few years have given Sandra the ability to chew and blink properly again (pictured, earlier this year after an operation)\n\nShe added: 'I've been told it will take up to eight months to see the full benefits but eventually I'll have what the doctors call 'a Mona Lisa Smile'. I can't wait to smile again!'\n\nNow Sandra says she is passionate about raising awareness of cavernomas, revealing: 'They're something most people, including many doctors, have never even heard of, which makes their diagnosis difficult.\n\n'I've heard of others who - like me - fought for a long time to get a diagnosis.'\n\nShe added: 'Looking back, I see that in the days when I was a beautician, I was naturally concerned with outward appearances.\n\nSandra now says she has learned to accept the changes to her appearance and said she feels 'blessed to be alive' (pictured, in summer 2019)\n\n'But later I had to learn to accept the changes in my appearance, discovering that what was on the inside mattered more.'\n\nShe added: 'I want to tell my story to let others know that no matter what you go through, if you hold tight to the positive, you can come through it.\n\n'Today, after everything I've been through, I feel blessed to be alive and surrounded by family and friends who love me. In the end that's really all that matters.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Sandra Liddell, 56, from  Suffolk, struggled for years to get a diagnosis for her ongoing headaches.
