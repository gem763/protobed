It showed \u201cthe LFB is an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the Grenfell Tower fire\u201d.\n\nHe concluded many lives could have been saved if her officers had identified sooner that the fire was out of control and told residents to evacuate. He found that the LFB failed to train its incident commanders and firefighters in how to recognise the need for evacuation or in the dangers of combustible cladding.\n\nBereaved and survivors welcomed Moore-Bick\u2019s much-delayed but \u201cstrong\u201d conclusions after previously fearing he would delay making significant findings until the second phase of the inquiry which begins next year, which will examine the refurbishment project that preceded the fire.\n\nMoore-Bick said there was already \u201ccompelling evidence that the external walls of the building failed to comply with requirements\u201d of building regulations governing fire safety. They didn\u2019t adequately resist the spread of fire, \u201con the contrary they actively promoted it\u201d he said.\n\nLawyers for the LFB sought the ruling that the building breached regulations, arguing the \u00a310m refit completed in 2016 was \u201ccatastrophically non-compliant with fire safety requirements\u201d. The LFB has said the entire safety strategy for Grenfell Tower required any fire to remain compartmentalised and that it could not have been expected to cope if the building was changed to allow fire to spread as it did.\n\nMoore-Bick praised the \u201cextraordinary courage and selfless devotion to duty\u201d of rank-and-file officers and said \u201cthose in the control room and those deployed on the incident ground responded with great courage and dedication in the most harrowing of circumstances\u201d.\n\nBut the absence of an operational evacuation plan for Grenfell Tower was \u201ca major omission\u201d by the LFB, which was guilty of an \u201cinstitutional failure\u201d to inform firefighters about the risks of cladding fires before the disaster. On the night of the fire there was a \u201cfailure of command\u201d which meant firefighters with extended-duration breathing kits were deployed too slowly.\n\nMichael Dowden, the watch manager from North Kensington fire station and the commander on the scene for most of the first hour, was criticised for failing to consider an evacuation sooner and not making efforts to find out what residents were telling 999 operators or the conditions in the building. The inquiry heard an officer of his rank would not normally be in charge of such a huge fire, but Moore-Bick concluded: \u201cI have little doubt that fewer people would have died if the order to evacuate had been given by 2am.\u201d\n\nThe report was informed by evidence from hundreds of witnesses including 88 firefighters, control room officers and senior LFB commanders, together with 35 of the bereaved, survivors and residents.\n\nIn September, the LFB said leaders of the brigade have been interviewed under caution by Scotland Yard detectives in relation to health and safety offences.\n\nThe report is set to be published in full on Wednesday, but was circulated to the bereaved, survivors and residents on Monday morning. Those seen collecting printed copies included Nabil Choucair who lost six members of the family in the fire, Clarrie Mendy, the aunt of the celebrated young artist Khadija Saye who died with her mother Mary Mendy, and Natasha Elcock, the chairwoman of Grenfell United who escaped with her partner and daughter but lost her uncle, who lived on an upper floor.\n\nEveryone who received an advance copy of the report was required to sign a non-disclosure agreement before taking it away.\n\nAmong the 72 victims of the fire were 19 children, and Cotton angered their relatives in her evidence when she compared preparing to tackle a fire like Grenfell to developing \u201ca training package for a space shuttle landing on the Shard\u201d, in other words something she would never need to do.\n\nMoore-Bick addressed this saying it showed an \u201cunwillingness to confront\u201d the fact that in October 2016 LFB fire engineers produced a slideshow titled \u201cTall Building Facades\u201d featuring cladding fires around the world. It warned of \u201ca need to understand what products are being used in the facade system and their fire behaviour \u2026 These could affect the way fires develop and spread in a building.\u201d\n\nThe findings came 26 months after Theresa May set up the inquiry in the wake of the disaster that devastated the north Kensington community and sparked a national fire safety crisis. Over 400 other tower blocks in England were found to have been wrapped in similar combustible cladding to that of Grenfell Tower.", "description": "Long-awaited report into tragedy that killed 72 people says shortcomings cost lives", "authors": ["Robert Booth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/829bc12e4b6259d62ce47c5fce4219e02b6ed3b1/0_61_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=41016e731e5099c88df33aabdc2b7289", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
