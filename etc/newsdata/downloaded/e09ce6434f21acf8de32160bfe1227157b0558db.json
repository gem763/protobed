A giant Scam!\u201d\n\nThe thing is, Mr. Trump, virtually every piece of information that the public first learned from the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint has been corroborated by the White House\u2019s reconstructed transcript of your call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine or by the congressional testimony and documents provided by current and former administration officials. In the few remaining cases, save one, journalists have backed up his assertions through reporting.\n\nBelow, the whistle-blower\u2019s assertions are highlighted and annotated.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nAugust 12, 2019 The Honorable Richard Burr\n\nChairman\n\nSelect Committee on Intelligence\n\nUnited States Senate\n\nThe Honorable Adam Schiff\n\nChairman\n\nPermanent Select Committee on Intelligence\n\nUnited States House of Representatives Dear Chairman Burr and Chairman Schiff: I am reporting an \u201curgent concern\u201d in accordance with the procedures outlined in 50 U.S.C. \u00a73033(k)(5)(A). This letter is UNCLASSIFIED when separated from the attachment. In the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election. This interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President\u2019s main domestic political rivals. The President\u2019s personal lawyer, Mr. Rudolph Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General Barr appears to be involved as well.\n\nOver the past four months, more than half a dozen U.S. officials have informed me of various facts related to this effort. The information provided herein was relayed to me in the course of official interagency business. It is routine for U.S. officials with responsibility for a particular regional or functional portfolio to share such information with one another in order to inform policymaking and analysis. I was not a direct witness to most of the events described. However, I found my colleagues\u2019 accounts of these events to be credible because, in almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another. In addition, a variety of information consistent with these private accounts has been reported publicly. I am deeply concerned that the actions described below constitute \u201ca serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law or Executive Order\u201d that \u201cdoes not include differences of opinions concerning public policy matters,\u201d consistent with the definition of an \u201curgent concern\u201d in 50 U.S.C. \u00a73033(k)(5)(G). I am therefore fulfilling my duty to report this information, through proper legal channels, to the relevant authorities.\n\nI am also concerned that these actions pose risks to U.S. national security and undermine the U.S. Government\u2019s efforts to deter and counter foreign interference in U.S. elections . 1\n\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nUNCLASSIFIED To the best of my knowledge, the entirety of this statement is unclassified when separated from the classified enclosure. I have endeavored to apply the classification standards outlined in Executive Order (EO) 13526 and to separate out information that I know or have reason to believe is classified for national security purposes.1 If a classification marking is applied retroactively, I believe it is incumbent upon the classifying authority to explain why such a marking was applied, and to which specific information it pertains. I. The 25 July Presidential phone call Early in the morning of 25 July, the President spoke by telephone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. I do not know which side initiated the call. This was the first publicly acknowledged call between the two leaders since a brief congratulatory call after Mr. Zelenskyy won the presidency on 21 April. Multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call informed me that, after an initial exchange of pleasantries, the President used the remainder of the call to advance his personal interests. Namely, he sought to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take actions to help the President's 2020 reelection bid. According to the White House officials who had direct knowledge of the call, the President pressured Mr. Zelenskyy to, inter alia: initiate or continue an investigation2 into the activities of former Vice President Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden ; assist in purportedly uncovering that allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine, with a specific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cyber security firm Crowdstrike,3 which initially reported that Russian hackers had penetrated the DNC's networks in 2016; and meet or speak with two people the President named explicitly as his personal envoys on these matters, Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General Barr, to whom the President referred multiple times in tandem .\n\n2\n\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nUNCLASSIFIED The President also praised Ukraine\u2019s Prosecutor General, Mr. Yuriy Lutsenko, and suggested that Mr. Zelenskyy might want to keep him in his position. (Note: Starting in March 2019, Mr. Lutsenko made a series of public allegations\u2014many of which he later walked back\u2014about the Biden family\u2019s activities in Ukraine, Ukrainian officials\u2019 purported involvement in the 2016 U.S. election, and the activities of the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. See Part IV for additional context.) The White House officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call. They told me that there was already a \u201cdiscussion ongoing\u201d with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials\u2019 retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.\n\nThe Ukrainian side was the first to publicly acknowledge the phone call. On the evening of 25 July, a readout was posted on the website of the Ukrainian President that contained the following line (translation from original Russian-language readout): \u201cDonald Trump expressed his conviction that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve Ukraine\u2019s image and complete the investigation of corruption cases that have held back cooperation between Ukraine and the United States.\u201d Aside from the above-mentioned \u201ccases\u201d purportedly dealing with the Biden family and the 2016 U.S. election, I was told by White House officials that no other \u201ccases\u201d were discussed. Based on my understanding, there were approximately a dozen White House officials who listened to the call \u2014 a mixture of policy officials and duty officers in the White House Situation Room, as is customary. The officials I spoke with told me that participation in the call had not been restricted in advance because everyone expected it would be a \u201croutine\u201d call with a foreign leader. I do not know whether anyone was physically present with the President during the call.\n\nIn addition to White House personnel, I was told that a State Department official, Mr. T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, also listened in on the call . I was not the only non-White House official to receive a readout of the call. Based on my understanding, multiple State Department and Intelligence Community officials were also briefed on the contents of the call as outlined above.\n\nII. Efforts to restrict access to records related to the call In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to \"lock down\" all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced\u2014as is customary\u2014by the White House Situation Room. This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call. White House officials told me that they were \"directed\" by White House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored for coordination, finalization, and distribution to Cabinet-level officials. 3\n\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nHighlight continues on the next page.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED Instead, the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature . One White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\n\nI do not know whether similar measures were taken to restrict access to other records of the call, such as contemporaneous handwritten notes taken by those who listened in. III. Ongoing concerns On 26 July, a day after the call, U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker visited Kyiv and met with President Zelenskyy and a variety of Ukrainian political figures. Ambassador Volker was accompanied in his meetings by U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. Based on multiple readouts of these meetings recounted to me by various U.S. officials, Ambassadors Volker and Sondland reportedly provided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to \u201cnavigate\u201d the demands that the President had made of Mr. Zelenskyy. I also learned from multiple U.S. officials that, on or about 2 August, Mr. Giuliani reportedly traveled to Madrid to meet with one of President Zelenskyy\u2019s advisers, Andriy Yermak. The U.S. officials characterized this meeting, which was not reported publicly at the time, as a \u201cdirect follow-up\u201d to the President\u2019s call with Mr. Zelenskyy about the \u201ccases\u201d they had discussed.\n\nSeparately, multiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelenskyy advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov. 4 I do not know whether those officials met or spoke with Mr. Giuliani, but I was told separately by multiple U.S. officials that Mr. Yermak and Mr. Bakanov intended to travel to Washington in mid-August.\n\nOn 9 August, the President told reporters: \u201cI think [President Zelenskyy] is going to make a deal with President Putin, and he will be invited to the White House. And we look forward to seeing him. He\u2019s already been invited to the White House, and he wants to come. And I think he will. He\u2019s a very reasonable guy. He wants to see peace in Ukraine, and I think he will be coming very soon, actually.\u201d IV. Circumstances leading up to the 25 July Presidential phone call Beginning in late March 2019, a series of articles appeared in an online publication called The Hill. In these articles, several Ukrainian officials \u2014 most notably, Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko \u2014 made a series of allegations against other Ukrainian officials and current and former U.S. officials. Mr. Lutsenko and his colleagues alleged, inter alia: 4\n\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nUNCLASSIFIED that they possessed evidence that Ukrainian officials \u2014 namely, Head of the National Anticorruption Bureau of Ukraine Artem Sytnyk and Member of Parliament Serhiy Leshchenko \u2014 had \"interfered\" in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, allegedly in collaboration with the DNC and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv5; that the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv \u2014 specifically, U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who had criticized Mr. Lutsenko's organization for its poor record on fighting corruption \u2014 had allegedly obstructed Ukrainian law enforcement agencies' pursuit of corruption cases, including by providing a \"do not prosecute\" list, and had blocked Ukrainian prosecutors from traveling to the United States expressly to prevent them from delivering their \"evidence\" about the 2016 U.S. election;6 and that former Vice President Biden had pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in 2016 to fire then Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin in order to quash a purported criminal probe into Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company on whose board the former Vice President's son, Hunter, sat.7 In several public comments,8 Mr. Lutsenko also stated that he wished to communicate directly with Attorney General Barr on these matters.9 The allegations by Mr. Lutsenko came on the eve of the first round of Ukraine\u2019s presidential election on 31 March. By that time, Mr. Lutsenko\u2019s political patron, President Poroshenko, was trailing Mr. Zelenskyy in the polls and appeared likely to be defeated. Mr. Zelenskyy had made known his desire to replace Mr. Lutsenko as Prosecutor General. On 21 April, Mr. Poroshenko lost the runoff to Mr. Zelenskyy by a landslide. See Enclosure for additional information. 5\n\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nUNCLASSIFIED It was also publicly reported that Mr. Giuliani had met on at least two occasions with Mr. Lutsenko: once in New York in late January and again in Warsaw in mid-February. In addition, it was publicly reported that Mr. Giuliani had spoken in late 2018 to former Prosecutor General Shokin, in a Skype call arranged by two associates of Mr. Giuliani.10 On 25 April in an interview with Fox News, the President called Mr. Lutsenko\u2019s claims \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cincredible\u201d and stated that the Attorney General \u201cwould want to see this.\u201d On or about 29 April, I learned from U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the situation that Ambassador Yovanovitch had been suddenly recalled to Washington by senior State Department officials for \u201cconsultations\u201d and would most likely be removed from her position.\n\nAround the same time, I also learned from a U.S. official that \"associates\" of Mr. Giuliani were trying to make contact with the incoming Zelenskyy team .11 On 6 May, the State Department announced that Ambassador Yovanovitch would be ending her assignment in Kyiv \u201cas planned.\u201d However, several U.S. officials told me that, in fact, her tour was curtailed because of pressure stemming from Mr. Lutsenko\u2019s allegations . Mr. Giuliani subsequently stated in an interview with a Ukrainian journalist published on 14 May that Ambassador Yovanovitch was \u201cremoved...because she was part of the efforts against the President.\u201d\n\nOn 9 May, The New York Times reported that Mr. Giuliani planned to travel to Ukraine to press the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations that would help the President in his 2020 reelection bid. In his multitude of public statements leading up to and in the wake of the publication of this article, Mr. Giuliani confirmed that he was focused on encouraging Ukrainian authorities to pursue investigations into alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and alleged wrongdoing by the Biden family.12 On the afternoon of 10 May, the President stated in an interview with Politico that he planned to speak with Mr. Giuliani about the trip. A few hours later, Mr. Giuliani publicly canceled his trip, claiming that Mr. Zelenskyy was \u201csurrounded by enemies of the [U.S.] President...and of the United States.\u201d On 11 May, Mr. Lutsenko met for two hours with President-elect Zelenskyy, according to a public account given several days later by Mr. Lutsenko. Mr. Lutsenko publicly stated that he had told Mr. Zelenskyy that he wished to remain as Prosecutor General. 6\n\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nUNCLASSIFIED Starting in mid-May, I heard from multiple U.S. officials that they were deeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giuliani\u2019s circumvention of national security decisionmaking processes to engage with Ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth between Kyiv and the President. These officials also told me:\n\nthat State Department officials, including Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, had spoken with Mr. Giuliani in an attempt to \u201ccontain the damage\u201d to U.S. national security ; and that Ambassadors Volker and Sondland during this time period met with members of the new Ukrainian administration and, in addition to discussing policy matters, sought to help Ukrainian leaders understand and respond to the differing messages they were receiving from official U.S. channels on the one hand, and from Mr. Giuliani on the other .\n\nDuring this same timeframe, multiple U.S. officials told me that the Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting or phone call between the President and President Zelenskyy would depend on whether Zelenskyy showed willingness to \u201cplay ball\u201d on the issues that had been publicly aired by Mr. Lutsenko and Mr. Giuliani. (Note: This was the general understanding of the state of affairs as conveyed to me by U.S. officials from late May into early July. I do not know who delivered this message to the Ukrainian leadership, or when.) See Enclosure for additional information.\n\nShortly after President Zelenskyy\u2019s inauguration, it was publicly reported that Mr. Giuliani met with two other Ukrainian officials: Ukraine\u2019s Special Anticorruption Prosecutor, Mr. Nazar Kholodnytskyy, and a former Ukrainian diplomat named Andriy Telizhenko. Both Mr. Kholodnytskyy and Mr. Telizhenko are allies of Mr. Lutsenko and made similar allegations in the above-mentioned series of articles in The Hill. On 13 June, the President told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that he would accept damaging information on his political rivals from a foreign government. On 21 June, Mr. Giuliani tweeted: \u201cNew Pres of Ukraine still silent on investigation of Ukrainian interference in 2016 and alleged Biden bribery of Poroshenko. Time for leadership and investigate both if you want to purge how Ukraine was abused by Hillary and Clinton people.\u201d In mid-July, I learned of a sudden change of policy with respect to U.S. assistance for Ukraine.

This is a standalone computer system reserved for codeword-level intelligence information, such as covert action. According to information I received from White House officials, some officials voiced concerns internally that this would be an abuse of the system and was not consistent with the responsibilities of the Directorate for Intelligence Programs.
