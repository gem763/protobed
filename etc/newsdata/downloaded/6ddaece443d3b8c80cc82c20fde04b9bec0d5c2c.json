(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nAs loyalty to parties\u2019 organizations and doctrines is supplanted by parties as hostility-based tribes, polarization supplies solidarity in an era of empty politics.\n\nWashington \u2014 There are political moments, and this might be one, in which worse is better. Moments, that is, when a society\u2019s per capita quantity of conspicuous stupidity is so high and public manners are so low that a critical mass of people are jolted into saying \u201cenough, already.\u201d Looking on the bright side, as he wisely is disinclined to do, Jonathan Rauch thinks such a moment might be arriving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWriting in National Affairs (\u201cRethinking Polarization\u201d), Rauch, a Brookings Institution senior fellow, postulates a vast emptiness at the core of the politics that has engulfed us: \u201cWhat if, to some significant extent, the increase in partisanship is not really about anything?\u201d What if rival tribalisms are largely untethered from ideologies?\n\nThis is plausible. The angriest conservatives, or at least people brandishing this label, show no interest in what was, until recently, conservatism\u2019s substance \u2014 limited government, balanced budgets, free trade, curbs in executive power, entitlement reform, collective security. Conservatives\u2019 anger is eerily unrelated to the comprehensive apostasy from what was, three years ago, conservatism\u2019s catechism.\n\nOf course, this catechism had long been (in Daniel Patrick Moynihan\u2019s formulation) avowed but not constraining: The conservative party did not allow professed beliefs to influence its behavior. So, on the right, a politics of passions unrelated to policy flooded into the vacuum of convictions unrelated to behavior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRauch\u2019s thesis is that increased polarization has little to do with ideas and much to do with hostile feelings \u2014 \u201cnegative partisanship\u201d \u2014 about others. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much that we like our own party,\u201d Rauch surmises, \u201cas that we detest the other.\u201d The Left, like the Right, has no plausible, meaning implementable, plan for solving pressing problems, from immigration to $1 trillion deficits at full employment. So, despising President Trump, who makes this easy, is a substitute for a politics of substance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGroup solidarity based on shared detestations is fun, and because fun can trigger dopamine bursts in the brain, it can be addictive. Rauch:\n\n\u201cOne of the most interesting characteristics of this \u2018new\u2019 form of polarization is that there is nothing new about it. Tribalism has been the prevalent mode of social organization for all but approximately the most recent 2% of years that humans have lived on the planet.\u201d The decline of civic organizations has people searching for connectedness. \u201cThe declining hold of organized religion . . . [has] displaced apocalyptic and redemptive impulses into politics, where they don\u2019t belong.\u201d Economic stagnation among the less educated provides opportunities for demagogues on the left (despising a never-popular minority: the wealthy) as well as the right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRauch says \u201chumans were designed for life in small, homogenous groups where change was slow and choices were few.\u201d If he is correct, both left and right, like scorpions in a bottle, are in diametrically opposed but symbiotic reactions against modernity \u2014 against an open society \u201cfounded on compromise, toleration, and impersonal rules and institutions.\u201d Hence, \u201cin education, elite universities frequently encourage students to burrow into their tribal identities rather than transcend them. In media, new technologies enable and monetize outrage and extremism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll this began before Trump slouched onto the political stage, and because of his electoral success he already has emulators among his despisers. Consider Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s grotesque \u2014 and classically demagogic \u2014 ascription of blame to unpopular others for everyone else\u2019s personal complaints \u2014 which she says government can remedy: \u201cYou\u2019ve got things that are broken in your life? I\u2019ll tell you exactly why. It\u2019s because giant corporations, billionaires have seized our government.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll demagogues begin by rejecting Samuel Johnson\u2019s wisdom: \u201cHow small, of all that human hearts endure, that part which laws or kings can cause or cure.\u201d Warren is a millimeter away from Trump\u2019s \u201cI alone can fix it,\u201d where the antecedent of the pronoun \u201cit\u201d is: everything.\n\nRauch believes that although political parties are instruments of partisan mobilization, it is their weakness that feeds today\u2019s polarization by smoothing the way for demagogues. Time was, the parties vetted candidates, \u201cscreening out incompetents, sociopaths, and those with no interest in governing.\u201d Now, \u201cthe more parties weaken as institutions whose members are united by loyalty to their organization, the more they strengthen as tribes whose members are united by hostility to their enemy.\u201d As loyalty to parties\u2019 organizations and doctrines is supplanted by parties as hostility-based tribes, polarization supplies solidarity in an era of empty politics.\n\nRauch hopes that America\u2019s current public awfulness might \u201cend up strengthening liberal norms and institutions by scaring us, at last, into defending them.\u201d Isn\u2019t it pretty to think so?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00a9 2019 Washington Post Writers Group", "description": "As loyalty to parties\u2019 organizations is supplanted by parties as hostility-based tribes, polarization supplies solidarity in an era of empty politics.", "authors": ["George Will", "Mairead Mcardle", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
