The price of car insurance did rise in the second quarter of this year but only by a small amount.\n\nData from the Association of British Insurers shows the cost of the average motor insurance policy in the UK rose to \u00a3467.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nA rise sounds like bad news but it was an increase of just \u00a31 compared to the previous three months. Average premiums were still \u00a310 cheaper than the same time last year.\n\nSo it sounds like car insurance customers are doing okay. But the truth is that some of us may end up paying far more if they ever need to claim.\n\nA little excessive\n\nNew analysis from GoCompare shows there has been a dramatic increase in compulsory excesses. That\u2019s the amount the driver agrees to pay before the insurer steps in to pay any claim.\n\nThe level of compulsory excesses has rocketed \u2013 from between \u00a350 and \u00a3475 in 2012, to between \u00a350 to \u00a33,000 in 2019. And \u00a33,000 is a pretty substantial sum to cough up before being able to actually claim an insurance payout after an incident.\n\nLee Griffin, CEO of the comparison website, says: \u201cPolicy excesses are a hidden cost for drivers and they have gone up significantly in recent years.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a massive difference in the cost of excesses between insurers. So when arranging cover it is essential you compare excess levels rather than just focusing on premiums.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to focus on the price of insurance but what really matters is not the cheapest policy but finding the cheapest policy that\u2019s right for you. And that means a policy with an excess that you can afford.\n\nOf course, you may decide to increase the voluntary excess to your policy in order to bring down the overall cost. That\u2019s a judgement only the motorist can make but if it isn\u2019t affordable then the entire policy could be wasted.\n\n\u201cSome drivers agree to pay a higher amount towards the cost of a claim in return for a lower premium,\u201d Griffin adds. \u201cHowever, if these drivers make a claim, their voluntary excess is added to the insurer\u2019s compulsory excess \u2013 which can add up to a considerable sum.\u201d\n\nMany drivers admitted they had not fully understood the cost of their policy; 13 per cent said it was more than they expected and well over half (62 per cent) said they would have to either raid their savings or borrow money to pay their excess and make a claim.\n\nPerhaps most worryingly, 5 per cent said they simply couldn\u2019t afford to pay their excess. Without paying the agreed excess, drivers who need to claim can\u2019t. It risks rendering the entire policy worthless and that is an expensive mistake.\n\nIt\u2019s also not the only way that drivers can unknowingly wreck their chances of making a claim. Here are a few more hazards to avoid:\n\nAccidentally fronting\n\nIt\u2019s fairly well known that bringing in an additional driver to a policy can bring the price down. But that does not mean it\u2019s okay to lie and say a more experienced motorist is the main driver \u2013 that\u2019s a type of fraud known as fronting.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, car insurance providers are pretty good at spotting it. Fronting can invalidate your insurance, leaving you unable to claim at all.\n\nYet recent research by Cifas, the fraud prevention service, showed that \u2018fronting\u2019 is considered \u201creasonable\u201d by 39 per cent of people. It risks being an expensive mistake.\n\nYou mislead your insurer\n\nThe information you give your insurer has to be true. You can\u2019t claim you keep the car off the road if you don\u2019t have a drive or a garage. You can\u2019t claim your vehicle hasn\u2019t been modified if it looks like something from Pimp My Ride.\n\nIf you have said you only use your car for personal use when you\u2019re actually driving it for business reasons then that risks leaving you unable to claim.\n\nNot updating your insurer\n\nShould your circumstances change during the policy you also need to let your insurer know, to make sure you are absolutely covered if you need to make a claim.\n\nFor example, if you get any new driving convictions, you have to let your insurer know and you may need to accept higher prices.\n\nIf you do not tell your insurer of any changes then you may find they consider you to have failed to meet your side of the agreement.\n\nNot taking care of your car\n\nYour fully comprehensive car insurance should protect you against theft, that\u2019s pretty standard.\n\nHowever, that cover may not be there if you are deemed to have taken unnecessary risks with your vehicle. Leaving it unlocked, for example, or leaving the keys in the engine while you go into a petrol station.\n\nOne of the biggest risks for drivers rises in winter when many leave their car engines running while the windows defrost \u2013 a lot of policies will consider that to be reckless and refuse to pay out.\n\nAll car insurance policies differ so you should read the documents and check that you\u2019re not accidentally driving without the protection you\u2019re paying for.", "description": "Insurers have dramatically hiked the maximum amount they can set as an excess for their car insurance, raising the possibility that some customers risk being unable to pay and make a claim.
