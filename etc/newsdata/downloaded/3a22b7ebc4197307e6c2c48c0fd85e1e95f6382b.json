As did special guest star Liev Schreiber.\n\nMcKinnon\u2019s Giuliani just wanted the president to relax, telling him that no one would be able to figure out about their illegal side dealings with the Ukraine \u2014 \u201cor how we tried to cover up those side dealings. Or how we plan to cover up the cover-up.\u201d\n\nHOW WOODY HARRELSON'S 'SNL' MONOLOGUE COMMENTS ON THE STATE OF COMEDY\n\nBeeping into Baldwin-as-Trump\u2019s call waiting was Aidy Bryant as Attorney General William Barr, who told him not to worry because he had his \u201ctop guy\u201d on this. But when that \u201ctop guy\u201d got on the line for a three-way call, it was just McKinnon-as-Giuliani again.\n\nBaldwin-as-Trump knew he had to find \u201cthe perfect stooge\u201d to take the blame for everything, and with that he called \u201cBig Mike\u201d aka Mike Pence (Beck Bennett). \u201cBut you\u2019re the one who broke the law,\u201d Bennett-as-Pence said. That call was cut short so Baldwin-as-Trump could talk to his sons, Eric (Alex Moffat) and Don Jr. (Mikey Day)\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe the lame-stream media is focused on you and not the corruption of Joe Biden\u2019s son,\u201d said Day-as-Don Jr.\n\n\u201cI know. By the way did you take car of that thing in Russia for me?\u201d Baldwin-as-Trump replied.\n\n\u201cWhat thing in Russia?\u201d Day-as-Don Jr. said with a laugh.\n\n\u201cThe treason!\u201d piped up Moffat-as-Eric.\n\nSHANE GILLIS MAKES FIRST STANDUP APPEARANCE SINCE 'SNL' FIRING\n\nYang then popped up on-screen, to loud audience cheers, as Kim Jong-un, who Baldwin-as-Trump called looking for advice on a whistleblower.\n\n\u201cYou have a big ocean in your country? OK, send whistleblower to the bottom of there\u201d was Yang\u2019s advice. To this, Baldwin-as-Trump said he wished America was as cool as North Korea.\n\nBut the antics didn\u2019t stop there, with Chris Redd reprising his role as Kanye West to call next, telling Baldwin-as-Trump they couldn\u2019t be \u201cfam\u201d anymore. The reason was that \u201cthis whole impeachment thing is hurting our brand,\u201d explained Don King (Kenan Thompson), who took the phone from Redd\u2019s Kanye West, as they were \u201chaving an emergency meeting of the Black wackadoos.\u201d\n\nCecily Strong also popped up as Jeanine Pirro, trying to offer the president a pep talk and reminding him, \u201cIf you really want someone to go away, you know who to call.\u201d Enter Schreiber.\n\n\u201cI told you, Mr. President, Ray Donovan\u2019s a fictional character. I\u2019m Liev Schreiber, the actor,\u201d he said, to which Baldwin-as-Trump countered with an ask to be connected to John Wick. When Schreiber told him he, too, was fictional, the next request was for Liam Neeson.\n\n\u201cActually, Liam might do it,\u201d Schreiber said.\n\nWatch \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d Season 45 cold open below:\n\nLater in the episode, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d returned to the hot topic of Donald Trump\u2019s potential impeachment in a special town hall sketch, in which the Democratic candidates got together on CNN to make cases for themselves while also making arguments against Trump.\n\n'SNL' SOUGHT CONSERVATIVE APPEAL WITH SHANE GILLIS HIRE\n\nIn this sketch, former cast member Maya Rudolph guest-starred as Kamala Harris, Larry David guest-starred as Bernie Sanders, and episode host Woody Harrelson portrayed Joe Biden. McKinnon returned to Elizabeth Warren, Moffat took on the role of Beto O\u2019Rourke, Redd portrayed Cory Booker and Yang portrayed Andrew Yang.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m America\u2019s cool aunt \u2014 a fun aunt. I call that a funt,\u201d Rudolph-as-Harris said. \u201cThe kind of funt that will give you weed but then arrest you for that weed. Can I win the presidency? Probably not, I don\u2019t know. Can I successfully seduce a much younger man? You better funting believe it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if she would still go past impeachment to prosecute Trump directly, Rudolph-as-Harris said \u201chell yeah\u201d that was still her plan: \u201cI\u2019m a smooth-talking lady lawyer. I\u2019m Rizzoli and I\u2019m Isles. I\u2019m a walking, talking TNT show. Don\u2019t you want four more years of me dressing down our enemies like this, \u2018You call that human rights, China? I call it human wrongs.'\u201d\n\nMcKinnon-as-Warren noted that she hoped \u201cyou all enjoyed hot girl summer \u2014 because it\u2019s school librarian fall. I have the energy of a mother of five boys who all play a different sport, let\u2019s do this.\u201d Meanwhile, David-as-Sanders said he was \u201cso excited to be back and to ruin things a second time\u201d before eventually promising \u201cfree college, free healthcare, free refills on any medium-sized soft drink.\u201d\n\nNew cast member Chloe Fineman, known online for her impressions long before booking this gig, took on Marianne Williamson, appearing \u201cvia astral projection,\u201d saying she wanted to trap Trump\u2019s soul inside a crystal, \u201cwhich I should note is also a yoni egg \u2014 so this election vote for magic.\u201d\n\nWHY LATE NIGHT COMEDY IS UNDER MORE SCRUTINY THAN EVER BEFORE\n\nOne exception was Harrelson\u2019s Biden, who was in a bit of a hot seat, as questions about his involvement in the Ukraine scandal were floated. \u201cI\u2019m like plastic straws: I\u2019ve been around forever, I\u2019ve always worked, and now you\u2019re mad at me?\u201d he said.\n\nAfter Harrelson-as-Biden told a story about an incident at a \u201csegregated pool,\u201d which he pointed out \u201cjust to put everyone on edge,\u201d David-as-Sanders noted that people were worried he would be the one who was out of touch, but next to Biden, he looks like Drake.\n\nWatch \u201cImpeachment Town Hall\u201d below:\n\nAnd finally, during the \u201cInside the Beltway\u201d sketch, Strong, Bryant, Harrelson and Thompson took on political pundits discussing whether or not impeachment was inevitable. Everyone seemed to think \u201cthere was something to this Ukraine story,\u201d as Harrelson\u2019s character put it \u2014 everyone except Thompson\u2019s character Quincy Maddox, who declared \u201cain\u2019t nothing going to happen.\u201d\n\nMEET 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE''S NEWEST CASTMEMBERS\n\nNo matter what evidence they stacked up, including a real-life clip of Nancy Pelosi saying \u201cNo one is above the law, including the president of the United States, and we believe the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up,\u201d mentioning the full Mueller Report showing multiple instances of wrongdoing, reflecting on the porn star scandal, or even showing clips of Trump himself mocking the differently-abled and talking about assaulting women, Quincy\u2019s \u201cain\u2019t nothing going to happen\u201d became quite the catchphrase \u2014 mostly because the clips dated back years and, well, nothing had happened to him yet.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAdmittedly this latter sketch got a bit derailed when a member of the crew came in to remove Bryant\u2019s jacket for a quick change \u2014 while the camera was still on the wide shot of the group. This caused them all to break wildly and perhaps created an even bigger meme than they hoped \u201cain\u2019t nothing going to happen\u201d would become.\n\nWatch \u201cInside the Beltway\u201d below:", "description": "\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has returned with its 45th season, and it wasted no time diving into the polarizing political climate by adding to the discussion around Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment with three separate sketches, including the cold open, as well as a dedicated \"Weekend Update\" segment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1134277310.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
