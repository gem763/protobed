At least two potential replacements were reached as part of an internal effort to push out Mulvaney.\n\nThe search for a new chief of staff, however, was derailed when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced late last month that the lower chamber of Congress was moving forward with impeachment proceedings.\n\nMulvaney has served in an \u2018acting\u2019 role as Trump's chief of staff for the last 10 months after retired Marine Corps General John Kelly stepped down from the post in early January following months of turmoil with the president.\n\nA new reports shows that there were internal efforts to push out and replace acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, but that plan was overshadowed and derailed after the House launched an impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump\n\nThe president's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner (pictured) was one of the aides pushing for Mulvaney's ousting and reaching out to potential replacements\n\nEfforts to replace Mulvaney were not able to come to fruition, but the report exhibits the weakness of his position even before he took the podium in the press briefing room last week and essentially admitted the president set a quid pro quo with Ukraine \u2013 the main charge Democrats cite for the impeachment inquiry.\n\nA source familiar with Mulvaney\u2019s thinking said the acting chief of staff is looking for an exit, but other people close with Mulvaney contradict this claim, insisting he does not want to leave.\n\nThe White House said that Mulvaney's \"standing in the White House has not changed.\"\n\n\"He is still the acting chief of staff and has the President's confidence,\" deputy press secretary Judd Deere said in a statement to CNN.\n\nDemocrats allege the president\u2019s freeze of nearly $400 million in military aid a few days before his July 25 call with his Ukrainian counterpart was an improper quid pro quo he set in exchange for Volodymyr Zelesnky digging up dirt of Joe Biden.\n\nTrump has vehemently denied that he set a quid pro quo and says his call with Zelensky was \u2018perfect.\u2019 Zelesnky has also claimed he did not feel pressure or \u2018blackmailed\u2019 into probing Biden and his son, Hunter\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nMulvaney, however, held a news conference Thursday where he said the U.S. requested Ukraine assist in the investigation into the handling of the Democratic National Committee server that was hacked in 2016 \u2013 and then insinuated that was the reason the administration decided to withhold funds from Ukraine.\n\n\"That's why we held up the money,\" Mulvaney said Thursday afternoon after listing the 2016-related investigation and Trump's broader concerns about corruption in Ukraine.\n\nMulvaney has denied admitting a quid pro quo.\n\nMulvaney was head of the Office of Management and Budget, a post he took a month after Trump\u2019s inauguration, and has never officially left that role as he assumed the acting position he now holds in the White House.\n\nBoth Trump and Mulvaney have publicly said they prefer he not be afforded the formal title and instead serve in an acting capacity.\n\nTrump has clashed with all three of his chiefs of staff, and when he disagrees will usually make the decisions and undercut his top administration official.\n\nA personal familiar with White House strategy indicates that Trump has raised concerns over having four chiefs of staff in three years.\n\nNews of Mulvaney\u2019s potential ousting comes as news that Energy Secretary Rick Perry, an original administration official, will leave at the end of this year.", "description": "Mick Mulvaney was likely the next administration official to face an ousting from the White House but that effort was overshadowed by the Democrats impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/14/19957250-0-image-a-12_1571579611457.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
