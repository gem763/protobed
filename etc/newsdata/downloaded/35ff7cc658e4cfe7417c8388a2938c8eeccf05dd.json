He died a coward,\" the President said. \"Crying, whimpering, screaming and bringing kids with him to die. Certain death.\"\n\nOther US officials declined to describe Baghdadi's state in his last moments.\n\nThe disaffected IS member had become an informant for Kurdish forces working with the Americans, the official said. And he provided critical information on al-Baghdadi's whereabouts.\n\nThe informant emerged early in the northern summer, and over time US officials became more confident in his credibility and reliability, the official said. Within the past couple of weeks, it became clear that, when put together with other information, the tip about al-Baghdadi's location was solid, the official said.\n\n\"It was a montage of a lot of pieces of intelligence that came together with a specific asset that was helpful,\" according to the official.\n\nHow the operation - named for Kayla Mueller, an American aid worker who was abducted and raped repeatedly by al-Baghdadi before she was killed, according to US officials - came together is still something of a mystery. The troops included some Delta Force members, according to two US officials, but other details, such as how they communicated with more senior commanders in Washington and beyond, and what weapons were involved, remain unknown.\n\nSituation Room\n\nBut in colourful and at times taunting language, Trump revealed details on Sunday morning Washington time of an operation that marks one of the major victories in the five-year US-led campaign against Islamic State.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe President, speaking at the White House, said he \"got to watch\" much of the raid beginning about 5pm on Saturday. He credited undisclosed technology for giving him \"absolutely perfect\" visuals that were \"as though you were watching a movie\".\n\nTrump, who returned to the White House from golfing about 4pm, entered the Situation Room about an hour later, he said. Seated at a table in a suit and tie, he was flanked in a photo released by the White House by Vice-President Mike Pence, Defence Secretary Mark Esper, White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien and two generals: Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Scott Howell, commander of Joint Special Operations Command.\n\nFlying after midnight in the Middle East, the helicopters needed to cross airspace controlled by Iraq, Turkey and Russia, and US officials told them they had an operation planned without providing details. With the Russians in Syria, the Pentagon has called such communication \"deconfliction\" and says it has prevented accidents and mistaken intent by adversary forces.\n\nWhen they arrived, they tried to call al-Baghdadi out to see whether he would surrender, Esper said. A couple of adults and 11 children came out, said one US official with knowledge of the operation.\n\nAl-Baghdadi remained inside, as US officials had assumed he might.\n\nUS forces responded by blowing holes into the side of the compound in an effort to avoid booby-trapped doors, Trump said. Al-Baghdadi retreated into a tunnel, and then detonated his vest.\n\nFive enemy fighters were killed in the operation inside the compound, and others were killed outside, the White House said in a statement. O'Brien said in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press that US troops confirmed al-Baghdadi was dead at 7.15pm Washington time.\n\n\"The commander of the mission called and said, '100 per cent confidence, jackpot . . . Got him. One hundred per cent confidence jackpot, over',\" O'Brien said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite al-Baghdadi's vest detonating, US troops were able to recognise him, the official said. A ground commander reported to General Frank McKenzie, chief of US Central Command, that they were \"absolutely convinced\" it was the Islamic State leader. McKenzie in turn relayed that message to the White House. The results of the DNA test were complete by Sunday morning, the official said.\n\nMilley was \"emphatic\" that the military had to dispose of Baghdadi's remains in accordance with Muslim traditions, which typically require burial within 24 hours, the official said. When US Navy SEALs killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, his body was buried at sea after traditional Islamic rites were performed. It was not immediately clear whether that occurred in al-Baghdadi's case.\n\nThe remains of at least two wives were left behind. Trump said they had not detonated their vests and were still wearing them, making it too risky for US troops to dispose of the bodies.\n\nHe said that one US working dog - described by the President as \"beautiful\" and \"talented\" - was wounded after chasing Baghdadi into the tunnel. Trump said no US troops were injured, but Esper said separately that two service members suffered minor injuries.\n\n\"They've already been returned to duty,\" Esper said, speaking on CNN's State of the Union.\n\n\"Less than 100\" US troops were on the ground in the raid, with more involved in a supporting role, Esper said. Several kinds of aircraft were used in the operation, including CH-47 helicopters. They came under fire early in the mission from \"locals in the area\" and the Americans returned fire in self-defence, he said.\n\nVideos circulating on social media appear to depict helicopters flying at low altitudes, heavy gunfire and occasional explosions.\n\nVideos circulating on social media on Sunday from Barisha, the village in Syria's Idlib Province where al-Baghdadi was hiding, appear to depict helicopters flying at low altitudes in the dark, heavy gunfire and occasional explosions. Images taken after daybreak show al-Baghdadi's home reduced to rubble. Esper said it was deliberately destroyed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump and other US officials credited Syrian Kurdish forces - whose alliance in the battle against the militants the president has recently played down as he withdraws forces from Syria - with providing useful information. Mazloum Abdi, commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, said in a tweet that they had been gathering information about al-Baghdadi for five months, while Trump said the operation itself started two weeks ago, once the United States had him \"scoped\".\n\n\"We thought he would be in a certain location,\" the President said. \"He was. Things started checking out very well.\"\n\nBut it wasn't clear how long al-Baghdadi would stay in Barisha, a small village west of Aleppo.\n\nPence, speaking on CBS's Face the Nation, said the US first received information about Baghdadi's most recent location early last week.\n\n\"Through a combination of intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, we believe we knew where he would be, and by Thursday afternoon were informed that there was a high probability he would be at the compound in Idlib province,\" Pence said.\n\nThe President directed the military to develop options, and they were presented on Friday, Pence said. \"Actionable intelligence\" obtained on Saturday allowed the raid to go forward, he added.\n\n\"It was incredible to be in the Situation Room and to see this unfold in real time as our special forces were on the ground, to see their professionalism over a period of two hours,\" he said. \"America and the world are safer today with the leader of ISIS dead.\"\n\nWashington Post", "description": "A disaffected ISIS member gave the Americans a firm lead on the whereabouts of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a Syrian village near Aleppo.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1839%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/30ec35d2fa84e001ad3dedd11633512b3758db34", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
