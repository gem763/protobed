However, too much sebum can lead to oily skin, clogged pores, and acne.\u2019 According to Dr. Joshua Zeichner, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital, how much oil your skin produces is determined by your genes. \u2018While you can\u2019t change your genetics, you can minimize the appearance of oily skin by using specific skin-care products,\u2019 he explains.\n\nAnd while squeaky-clean skin may be tempting, \u2018It is important to remember that you still want to treat skin gently,\u2019 says Dr. Michelle Park of Washington Square Dermatology. \u2018The goal is not to strip skin of all oils. In fact, if you do that, it will lead to worsening acne and skin quality, as the dryness will send a signal to the skin to make even more sebum to compensate, leading to even oilier skin.\u2019\n\nTo help you choose a face wash that will help control your oil without stripping your skin of it, we spoke to five dermatologists (and two makeup artists) for their recommendations.\n\nBest overall face wash for oily skin\n\nCeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser for Normal to Oily Skin When choosing a face wash, Park says to look for something \u2018gentle and foaming, so it can gently remove oil and impurities.\u2019 She adds that it should also be oil-free and noncomedogenic (i.e., won\u2019t clog pores). She and Frieling both recommend CeraVe\u2019s Foaming Facial Cleanser, which Park says is safe for all skin types, including oily skin. \u2018I love this product because the formula has three essential ceramides to cleanse the skin without stripping it in the process,\u2019 says Frieling. Ceramides, she adds, help skin rebuild and repair the protective barrier to make it more resilient against future damage and signs of aging. It also contains hyaluronic acid, which provides moisture, and niacinamide, which soothes and calms the skin, while sodium lauroyl lactylates give the cleanser its foaming consistency, which helps loosen skin impurities. Park notes that because foaming washes get deeper into your pores than creamier solutions to remove dirt, oil, and makeup, they have the potential to leave the skin feeling dry. If you find a foaming cleanser too drying, experiment with different ones to find one that works for your skin, she advises. \u2018And it\u2019s important to remember to continue to moisturize the face,\u2019 she adds. \u00a310 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nOther foaming cleansers\n\nNeutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser Zeichner recommends a foaming face wash for his patients who have oily skin, saying that they \u2018more effectively remove oil as compared to cleansing lotions or balms.\u2019 He recommends this gentle daily foaming cleanser from Neutrogena because it contains \u2018hydrophobically modified polymers,\u2019 which he says \u2018effectively cleanse and remove dirt and oil without disrupting the outer skin layer.\u2019 \u00a39 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nLa Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser for Oily Skin Here\u2019s another foaming recommendation from Park, and it contains ceramides, which maintain the skin barrier, as well as niacinamide, which can lower sebum-excretion rates. \u00a332 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nMario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel If you find a foaming cleanser too drying, makeup artist Shara Strand recommends trying a cleansing gel, like this one from Mario Badescu. \u2018Any gel is great for oily skin, as gel is really cooling, and it has moisturizing elements to balance out oily skin,\u2019 she explains. This particular cleanser includes fruit enzymes and alpha-hydroxy acids that gently exfoliate impurities from the skin. Strand suggests starting with micellar water on a cotton pad to remove makeup, then washing with the gel, then following up with a lightweight moisturizer. According to Strand, \u2018The less product you use on your face, the less oily your skin will be.\u2019 \u00a323 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nClarisonic Skin Renewing Peel Treatment Glycolic Acid Cleanser Dr. Jennifer MacGregor of Union Square Laser Dermato\u00adlogy recommends trying light peeling agents like glycolic acid and salicylic acid to help with oil production. \u2018For those with oily skin that tend to get blocked pores, I love gentle glycolic cleansers,\u2019 she says. She recommends \u2018using it in the morning before applying a light oil-free sunscreen moisturizer.\u2019 Her favorite exfoliating cleanser, Skinceuticals LHA Cleanser Gel for acne-prone skin, is not currently available, but we\u2019ve included an alternative from Clarisonic. \u00a319 at Ebay Buy\n\nFace washes for acne-prone oily skin\n\nNeutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash According to Park, having an excess of sebum can lead to clogged pores from dead skin cells sticking to the sebum, which results in acne. If you are prone to breakouts, she recommends looking for a face wash that can gently exfoliate the skin to get rid of impurities, dirt, and oil. \u2018Products that contain low amounts of benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid will achieve this without being too harsh,\u2019 says Park. Dr. Tara Rao of Schweiger Dermatology Group agrees that those two ingredients can help reduce some of the oil buildup that occurs on the skin throughout the day. Park recommends Neutrogena\u2019s Oil-Free Acne Wash \u2014 whose active ingredient is salicylic acid \u2014 as a reliable option for a face wash that\u2019s gentle yet effective. \u00a39 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nClean & Clear Acne Triple Clear Facial Cleanser \u00a36 at Ebay Buy\n\nClay cleanser for oily skin\n\nDermalogica Dermal Clay Cleanser For a more \u2018clean beauty\u2019 alternative to a face wash, Frieling recommends this clay cleanser from Dermalogica. It contains kaolin, bentonite, and green clays, which she says \u2018banish excess oil and impurities to deep-cleanse the skin.\u2019 To balance out these ingredients, it\u2019s infused with menthol, sage, cucumber, and milk proteins, which Frieling says help calm the skin. \u00a334 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nAztec Secret Indian Healing Clay This cult product is made of 100 percent calcium bentonite clay (which you mix with apple-cider vinegar or water to create a mask) \u2014 and a much cheaper alternative to the Dermalogica clay cleanser. Makeup artist Melissa Bedi swears by it: \u2018I love Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay mask to draw out impurities and tighten pores.\u2019 \u00a326 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nCharcoal cleanser for oily skin\n\nBoscia Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser \u2018Charcoal is another commonly used ingredient for oily skin because it is highly absorbent and attaches to and removes oil from the skin,\u2019 says Zeichner. He recommends this warming gel cleanser from Boscia that contains both activated charcoal and vitamin C to help remove oil and refine skin texture. \u00a320 at Amazon UK Buy \u00a325 at Boots Buy\n\nFace-wash alternatives for oily skin\n\nNaissance Distilled Witch Hazel Bedi chooses to forgo face washes (which she says \u2018are filled with chemicals and are drying to the skin\u2019) altogether, instead using this witch-hazel facial toner to cleanse her face. She likes that it\u2019s \u2018gentle and hydrating\u2019 and uses it on cotton pads to clean her face, even when she\u2019s wearing makeup. (She takes off her eye makeup with a separate eye-makeup remover first.) [Editor\u2019s Note: Bedi\u2019s choice is not available in the UK, so we recommend this very similar alternative.] \u00a39 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nEpicuren Discovery Microderm Ultra-Refining Scrub To exfoliate, Bedi uses this scrub every two to three weeks to slough away dead skin. The physical exfoliant has crystals that, according to Bedi, \u2018are perfectly round and roll on the skin, and so will not microscopically tear pores and enlarge them.\u2019 \u00a358 at Strawberry Net Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
