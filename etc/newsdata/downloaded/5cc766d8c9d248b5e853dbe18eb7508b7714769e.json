Citing his lawyer, The New York Times reported on Thursday that the junior Biden has yet to profit financially from his part-ownership nor has he been paid for sitting on the firm's board of directors.\n\nRegardless of the veracity of Trump's charges against the Bidens, the furore is likely to complicate bilateral relations, already strained by a costly trade war that began in July 2018.", "description": "The White House scrambled to play down concerns on Friday that willingness from China to investigate Joe Biden and his son would lead to progress in resolving the trade war.Amid a rapidly escalating impeachment storm surrounding US President Donald Trump, his appeal to Beijing on Thursday to look into", "authors": ["Owen Churchill"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HvY.vBa9YQwjNCcb7MYwug--~B/aD01NDg7dz05NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_us_228/0e7216caad4d39d34b3a81fa7af9abfe", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
