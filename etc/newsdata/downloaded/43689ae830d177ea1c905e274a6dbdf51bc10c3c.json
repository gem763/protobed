So if they are doing it, why aren\u2019t we examining it more?\n\n\"This is something that\u2019s been around for thousands of years and has been illegal for just over a hundred years.\n\n\"We could be missing something very beneficial.\u201d\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nBill was diagnosed in 2018 and has endured nine rounds of chemo. He is desperate to avoid more and says: \u201cI refuse to believe I\u2019m out of options.\u201d\n\nHe was motivated to try cannabis by the experience of 14-year-old cancer patient Deryn Blackwell, who had a miraculous recovery after his mother gave him cannabis oil for pain relief.\n\nHe said: \u201cI find Deryn\u2019s story deeply inspiring. To come back from the brink of death like that is truly wonderful.\u201d\n\nBill goes to visit Jeff Ditchfield, who has been growing cannabis, processing it for medicinal purposes and giving it to people who need it for the past 15 years.\n\nMeeting Jeff \u2013 who has been arrested more than 20 times \u2013 in his garden workshop, Bill laughs: \u201cThis may look like an episode of Breaking Bad but Jeff is no Walter White, his drugs come free.\u201d\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nBefore Bill tries the oil, Jeff warns him taking the concoction is an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act, saying: \u201cI have to ask you, are you aware that you\u2019re going to be breaking the law?\u201d\n\nBill replies: \u201cIt\u2019s for medicinal purposes, so let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d\n\nRubbing the mixture under his tongue, he says it tastes \u201clike pesto, very planty\u201d. Bill then tries vaping the drug and is soon laughing uncontrollably and telling the camera: \u201cThis is really unfair.\u201d\n\nSpeaking through fits of giggles, he adds: \u201cI cannot compose a sentence, I just can\u2019t do it.\u201d He says he felt so nauseous afterwards he feared he might throw up over the director.\n\nBill says the problem with the drug being illegal is no one knows the correct dose to take or how different dosages of the 5,000 different varieties might benefit different types of cancer.\n\n(Image: Pete Dadds/ Channel 4)\n\n\u201cI feel a little conflicted by the vagueness of it all,\u201d he says. \u201cImagine you had aspirin, or some other painkiller, unlicensed.\n\n\"And you were told, \u2018Well, this could be really good for you but we do not know how much you should actually take\u2019.\n\n\"You\u2019d be completely in the dark. And that is the issue with cannabis at the moment.\u201d\n\nBill has continued with the CBD but stopped taking THC. \u201cI could not work out what was good for me and what wasn\u2019t. So I just thought I will give it a give it a rest for the time being, until I can get some better guidance.\u201d\n\nHowever, while making the film, he was disappointed to learn levels of prostate-specific antigen in his blood are still rising, despite his various treatments and going meat-free.\n\nBut he continues to try new things \u2013 including laughter therapy and giving up alcohol. \u201cA lot of people say I look better since giving up drinking,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI say, you kind of have to be on top of it or it can be on top of you, you have to decide. And being on top of it is a much happier place to be.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nHis wife Sarah and three children all feature in the film and Bill says: \u201cI\u2019m fortunate to have the support I have and the family I have.\n\n\"It helps you stay positive and you can\u2019t measure the effect of what positivity does for you.\u201d\n\nBill also has tearful moments in the show and says: \u201cIt\u2019s a very emotional business, one is because I am on a hormone treatment, which does make me spill over, to suppress the testosterone.\n\n\"It makes you more likely to cry and crying is a very important thing to do when under this kind of stress.\u201d\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nBill\u2019s consultant has told him he aims to get him to at least 80 \u2013 which the retired presenter is happy with.\n\n\u201cI think the thing is to live without fear, because fear is negative energy. So do not let it overshadow your life.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, Bill insists he will keep on trying everything he can.\n\n\u201cI would love to be cured! But I like to think, if I have ambition, it would be to die with it rather than of it. So you have it but die of something else. That is a reasonable thing to ask for.\u201d", "description": "The presenter has endured nine rounds of chemo since and says he'll try anything to avoid any more", "authors": ["Nicola Methven", "Image", "Channel", "Pete Dadds", "Getty", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20578979.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Bill-Turnbull-ed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
