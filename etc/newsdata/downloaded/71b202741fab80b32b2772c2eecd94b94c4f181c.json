The top half of a double decker bus appears now and then above the wall and glides on towards the city centre. Alexander-Arnold follows the line of our pointing fingers and looks at something that is not there.\n\nThere was a squat brick building in the corner once where the changing rooms and the gym used to be in the Seventies and Eighties and where the players had tea and toast in the canteen before they went out to train. At the end of every season, Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan packed away the trophies or medals that had been won and told the players they meant nothing now.\n\nAlexander-Arnold knows all the Liverpool lore. He lived close to the training ground when he was a kid. Long after the brick building had been razed, he stood on dustbins or the top of his mum's car to peer over the wall to try to get a glimpse of Steven Gerrard or Xabi Alonso training at Melwood. He was a kid at the gates, peering in.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold went great lengths to see Liverpool as a kid, now he's their poster boy\n\nNow, he is a symbol of the new Liverpool. He is the poster boy for the success of the club's academy at Kirkby on the outskirts of the city and when Liverpool move their first-team facilities to a lavish new \u00a350million training ground on the academy site next summer, Alexander-Arnold says it will feel like coming home.\n\nAmid the orgy of nostalgia at the leaving of Melwood, some will mourn a break with the past, but there is general acknowledgment that the move will mark another leap forward for the club as they try to re-establish themselves as the dominant force in English football.\n\nLiverpool are a club in a hurry again. Alexander-Arnold, a 20-year-old who has already played in two Champions League finals, is the personification of the pace of change.\n\nHe talks about the club's ambition with a maturity and an eloquence beyond his years and as he articulates the nagging regrets that accompanied everything Liverpool achieved last season, it is easy to see the link between him and the glorious past of a club who were once a byword for the relentlessness of their success and who are striving to climb to the summit again.\n\nMany thought that after losing the titanic struggle with Manchester City for the Premier League title last season, finishing second despite losing only once all season and accruing 97 points, Liverpool would sag this season. Instead, they face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday having started their campaign with five straight wins.\n\nLiverpool won the Champions League last season, club football's biggest prize, and yet listening to Alexander-Arnold, it still only feels as if they are on the brink of something. There is no sense that that triumph in Madrid marked the end of a great quest. At Liverpool, the belief is that it was an aperitif. The club are greedy for honours again, like they used to be.\n\nIt's easy to see the link between the 20-year-old defender and the club's glorious past\n\n'When we won the Champions League last season,' says Alexander-Arnold, 'the celebrations were incredible. But it wasn't even a week of pure joy. We still weren't satisfied. The attitude was that it would have been better if it was the double that we had done. We told ourselves that that was what we needed to push for this season.\n\n'We know that we're capable of it. We won the Champions League and we were two points off winning the league. So how can we make up those two points and win it this season? We'd won the Champions League but the thought process was, 'This isn't enough'.\n\n'We don't want to be remembered as that Liverpool team that only won the Champions League. We want to be the team that people can't remember how many trophies we have won because we won so many. If someone mentions Liverpool winning the Premier League, we want people to say, \"Which one?\" or \"What year was that? Was that number 19? Was that 21?\"\n\n'We want people to be confused about how many trophies we won. We don't want to be remembered as the team who missed out to Manchester City in a great title race. We don't want to be the team that nearly did it. We want to be the team that did it.'\n\nHe said winning Champions League last season was not enough to satisfy Liverpool's players\n\nAlexander-Arnold represents much of the best of the new Liverpool. Many, including his manager, Jurgen Klopp, rate him the best right-back in the world but he is without arrogance or entitlement. He asks for nothing, people at the club say. He makes the most community appearances of any Liverpool player. He is low-key and low maintenance, a man who believes in the importance of manners and politeness.\n\nAlexander-Arnold spent the early years of his secondary education at the private St Mary's College, in Crosby, north of Liverpool before moving to a state school at Rainhill. He has seen both sides of the system. 'There were a lot of dynamic people at both my schools,' he said. 'I got a lot of opportunities to play different sports at St Mary's. I loved it.'\n\nIf they say one thing about him above all others, though, it is that he is resilient. He gets knocked down and he gets up again. He treats setbacks as learning experiences. It happened when Marcus Rashford got the better of him at Old Trafford the season before last. It was the same when he struggled against Wilfried Zaha. He rebounds from it. He comes back better.\n\n'If people criticise me, I make sure it doesn't happen again,' he says. 'Learn from it. You don't like the criticism, so why would you let it happen again.'\n\nIt is easy to extrapolate that and apply it to the pain Liverpool felt when they missed out to City last season. Their response has been to come flying out of the blocks and build the biggest lead any team has ever had at this stage of a campaign.\n\n'That Barca corner was instinctive' Liverpool performed one of the greatest comebacks in Champions League history last season when they beat Barcelona 4-0 at Anfield to overcome a three-goal, first-leg deficit in their semi-final. For many, the highlight of the game was Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s improvised corner late in the game \u2014 when he pretended to walk away from the kick, and then dashed back to swing it into the box \u2014 which led to Liverpool\u2019s decisive goal, scored by Divock Origi. \u2018We hadn\u2019t practised it,\u2019 Alexander-Arnold says. \u2018It was just instinctive. I just saw an opportunity and took it. I saw people turning their backs, people not looking at the ball, I saw the keeper trying to give instructions to someone. There was not one Barcelona player looking at the ball. \u2018I saw Divock Origi in the middle. I saw one red shirt in the middle of the box and I thought, \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u2018If it hadn\u2019t worked, I would have been shouted at. \u2018The thought process was half a second but it was worth the risk in my eyes. Div never even got a shout. I just hit it and thought, \u201clet\u2019s see what happens\u201d.\u2019 GAME CHANGER: Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner that caught Barcelona napping\n\n'When you come so, so close to winning something, it can go one of two ways,' says Alexander-Arnold. 'It can haunt you and leave bad memories or you can use it as motivation. The best example is what happened to us in the Champions League final in Kiev in 2018, when we lost to Real Madrid, and what happened last season.\n\n'We learned from Kiev and we used it last season to help us get through certain games, get results. We learned from Madrid and how they won games and we used it last season in the league and the Champions League.\n\n'I'm sure we picked up things from how City won last year. They showed us how winning's done. They were relentless.\n\n'Losing the title was the worst feeling many of us had ever felt in football. Coming so close to something. Coming so close to feeling as though you have made something of yourself and made your family proud and then in a split second, you feel as if you have let everyone down in the world, you feel as if you weren't good enough.\n\n'It's something we talked about straight away after the end of last season. It's motivation not to feel that again.' When Liverpool began their defence of the Champions League with defeat by Napoli in Italy last week, it provided more fuel for the debate about whether they should sacrifice the pursuit of repeated European glory in order to strengthen their attempt to win the domestic league title for the first time since 1990.\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp believes Alexander-Arnold is the best right-back in the world\n\nLiverpool have had a special affinity with the European Cup but partly because of their success last season, there is now a general acceptance that winning the Premier League for the first time is the achievement that their supporters and many within the club covet above all others.\n\n'Historically,' says Alexander-Arnold, 'the way of thinking was that it might be easier to succeed in the league if you didn't have other commitments. But that's changed. If you look at City, they push on all fronts. They want to win every competition. And that's what we want to do.\n\n'You can't dismiss one trophy to go after another. Why not go for both? We have got the quality in the squad. We want to win everything. We have to be selfish about that. We don't want to give other teams an easy route into winning trophies. We want to dominate on all fronts, get to finals, go to Wembley in May every season, be around the title race every season.\n\n'Being a fan, knowing how the fans feel, we know that the dream for them is to see Liverpool win the league again, win the Premier League for the first time. As players, we want to win everything but knowing that the fans would love the league more than the other trophies makes us want to get it for them even more.'\n\nHe struggled against Marcus Rashford last year but treats his setbacks as learning experiences\n\nAlexander-Arnold may have been the youngest ever Liverpool player to start a European Cup final but he is certainly not a kid any more. Because he is a modest man, he finds it hard to believe that kids look up to him now but he accepts that that is a responsibility he has to face.\n\n'I want to be the person who, when a young player goes home, he tells his mum he wants to be like me,' says Alexander-Arnold. 'I understand I am a role model for young players. I want to be a role model that motivates young players as I was once motivated by the likes of Gerrard and Jamie Carragher.\n\n'I want to be the one who motivates them to work hard in school and training to develop themselves and push themselves every single day and know that anything is possible with enough hard work and dedication.'\n\nHis role in the dressing room has changed, too. The senior players used to call him 'Pup'. They don't call him that any more. He has played in two Champions League finals. He is an established England player. He has played at a World Cup. No one could ever accuse him of being cocky but in his own quiet way, he has become a leader.\n\nAlexander-Arnold wants to be a role model and set an example like Kop icon Steve Gerrard did\n\nHe still has a hunger to learn. And he knows he is still improving. Carragher said recently that Alexander-Arnold has to contribute more goals to the team and that is something he accepts. He is too modest to point out that his assists record is spectacular. No one in the Premier League has put in more crosses than him this season.\n\n'Scoring more goals is something I'd like to improve,' he says. 'The modern day full-back needs to be so attacking, needs to offer a lot to the side, whether that be chances created, assists, passes, through-balls. Why not take it a step further and add four or five goals in to help the team?\n\n'When I was studying full-backs it was always Philipp Lahm and Dani Alves. For me, it's Alves. He's a really attacking aggressive player, solid in his defensive duties but really good attacking-wise, almost like a winger, makes things happen.Our analysts would clip together Alves's best work of the season for me to study. Positional stuff, decision-making, runs. I focused more on Lahm defensively and Alves in the attacking sense.\n\n'I enjoy the attacking side of being a full-back more but I understand that the defensive side is more important. Without a solid foundation, you are going to have to outscore teams 5-4, 4-3 and we don't want that.\n\nTrent said he was shy as a youngster but now he feels respected in the dressing room\n\n'I know I'm still learning. I feel as though there are times where maybe in a game I will do something good and think to myself that last season I wouldn't have been in that position to do that.\n\n'I feel as though I am respected within the changing room now. Respect is something that needs to be earned, not just handed out.\n\n'I was a shy lad who didn't really speak and just wanted to play football. Now I'll go in and have banter with the boys, we'll talk about things, discuss the game, how things are in everyday life and feeling a bit more of a role within the squad and the team and trying to embrace that and learn from the senior players around me who are elite professionals and try to become what they are.'\n\nAs Liverpool evolve, as the club reaches for new glories, Alexander-Arnold is reaching with it. 'There is always space for improvement and room to learn and evolve,' he says.\n\n'You can't have a closed mind and think, 'This is my limit' because then that is your limit. If you tell yourself you can learn, then the sky's the limit.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW BY OLIVER HOLT: Trent Alexander-Arnold wants to achieve so much success with Liverpool that people lose count of how many trophies they've won.", "authors": ["Oliver Holt For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/21/20/18765630-0-image-a-5_1569092734225.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
