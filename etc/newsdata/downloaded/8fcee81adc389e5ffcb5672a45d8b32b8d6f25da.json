This is now only done \"on an exception basis\".\n\n'Why not litigate?'\n\n\"We have implemented our 'why not litigate?' approach and the new Office of Enforcement,\" ASIC stated in the submission.\n\n\"This may mean taking more enforcement actions against auditors for defective audits and auditor independence issues.\n\nASIC said that in about 10 per cent of its sample of files, it found problems that led to material changes to the financial report.\n\n\"We will review our criteria for taking auditor enforcement actions, and the types of outcomes we may seek, including the use of enforceable undertakings and referrals of matters to the [Companies Auditors Disciplinary Board] as part of our implementation of the new Office of Enforcement.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nASIC added that legal amendments had \"increased some of the maximum penalties for audit misconduct and created a new fault\u2010based criminal offence\" that has a maximum penalty of $50,400 or two years\u2019 imprisonment, or both.\n\n\"We anticipate that these reforms to penalties, as well as our \u2018why not litigate?\u2019 approach to enforcement, will mean court action will be considered appropriate in more cases. We are actively reviewing current financial reporting and audit matters, where we have concerns, to see whether court action is appropriate as a public deterrent.\"\n\nThe regulator outlined the audit quality problems it had consistently uncovered during its long-running inspection program, especially around asset valuation and revenue recognition.\n\n\"While the largest firms continue to work to improve audit quality, the findings from our audit file reviews show that further efforts are required,\" its submission said.\n\nMaterial changes to examined files\n\nASIC also highlighted that in about 10 per cent of its risk-targeted sample of files, its officers found problems that led to material changes to the company's financial report.\n\n\"In nine of the 98 audit files that we reviewed, we identified and raised financial reporting concerns that led to material changes to the net assets and profits reported by the companies concerned,\" ASIC stated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe regulator also outlined its findings around the inspection program, which showed it felt that not enough auditing work had been done to be able to confidently sign off on aspects of the accounts in roughly one in four of the key audit areas it examined.\n\nThe percentage of findings where ASIC felt insufficient work had been done varied markedly by big four consulting firm. Deloitte had the highest rate, 32 per cent, compared with EY (22 per cent), KPMG (21 per cent) and PwC (12 per cent).\n\n\"The findings from our audit and financial report reviews mainly relate to asset values and revenue recognition. The nature of our findings are consistent with those of international regulators with responsibility for audit oversight,\" ASIC stated.\n\nASIC has confirmed it wants \"remediation power\" to force auditors to redo faulty work and the power to replace auditors when their work is inadequate because its current powers take too long to apply.\n\n\"We would benefit from the ability to require auditors to remediate deficiencies on individual audits and across the firm. A power enabling ASIC to compel auditors to remediate deficient audits on a timely basis would enable the market to be properly informed as to whether the financial report was materially misstated,\" ASIC stated.\n\n\"Consideration might also be given to an ability to remove firms from specific audits if remediation does not occur as required. The existing legislative process for issuing public reports on audit deficiencies can take more than a year.\"", "description": "ASIC will bring its 'why not litigate' approach to its policing of audit quality and intends to make use of a new 'fault-based criminal offence'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3582%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_92/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/409f733d474cdf1e6f2bed6154a759748f0a47e7", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
