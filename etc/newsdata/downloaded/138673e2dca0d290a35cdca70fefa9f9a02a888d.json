In the process, Woodson will weave in references to nearly a century of African American history \u201calmost erased\u201d by the enduring stain of racism, poverty, violence and drug addiction.\n\nOne of the earliest memories belongs to Melody\u2019s grandmother, Sabe, who recalls her ancestors telling her about the 1921 massacre in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when rampaging whites destroyed the thriving middle-class black community of Greenwood. \u201cI made sure Iris knew,\u201d Sabe thinks. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to make sure Melody knows too, because if a body\u2019s to be remembered, somebody has to tell its story.\u201d\n\nMiraculously, Woodson manages to use this one particular Brooklyn family as a prism through which she explores profound generational differences in attitudes toward race, class, gender and sexuality. When, after giving birth to Melody, Iris goes off to Oberlin College, where she falls in love with a female classmate without even understanding what it might mean to be a lesbian, just knowing that when they\u2019re together, she \u201cfelt red at the bone - like there was something inside of her undone and bleeding.\u201d\n\nBy the time Melody is a teenager, society has changed to the point where her best friend Malcolm, who among other things excels at voguing, already knows that he\u2019s gay. Indeed, Woodson lets him recite what might be the coda for this warm and lovely novel: \u201cToday you got introduced to society, Melody,\u201d he says when her party is over. \u201cShoot, I love that people think the world is even halfway ready for what we about to bring.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"Red at the Bone\" (Riverhead Books), by Jacqueline Woodson", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ann Levin"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/book_review_-_red_at_the_bone_13891_c0-773-1565-1685_s1770x1032.jpg?5080fd495ff7531b284f49db6e427aa311780a43", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
