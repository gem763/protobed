The 64-page list of amendments keeps a transition period up to 31 December 2020 and the \u00a339bn divorce bill. But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic. In the backstop's place would effectively be 'two borders' in a hybrid system: Northern Ireland and Britain would share a legal customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the 310-mile border with the Republic. But in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts a customs border across the Irish Sea - more of this below. Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea. The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term. Meanwhile commitments on workers' rights are deprioritised - moved to the non-legally-binding Political Declaration for agreement later.

I've given up predicting to be honest. But I've ordered a winter coat.\"\n\n(Image: Inknown)\n\nMr McDonnell and a fellow shadow cabinet minister have both moved to dampen mounting speculation of a \"Grinch\" poll just days before winter break.\n\nSome in No10 are agitating for Boris Johnson to force a vote on a snap election next week after his bid to rush through his Brexit deal was voted down.\n\nThat could mean polling day is as early as Thursday 5 December. Yet to do that he needs 434 MPs' backing - meaning he must have Labour support.", "description": "Talk of an election has ramped up as the EU decides whether to grant a Brexit extension", "authors": ["Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Getty Images", "Wpa Pool", "Inknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20714392.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BESTPIX-Boris-Johnson-Takes-Questions-In-The-House.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
