We are wholly committed to our values, which include treating everyone equally, so have made the decision to no longer work with Mumsnet,\u2019 Upfield told The Drum.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Mumsnet replied to the news.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Mumsnet will always stand in solidarity with minority communities,\u2019 a representative said.\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t tolerate transphobic comments and will delete any when they are flagged to us. But we do also believe strongly in free speech.\n\n\u2018The discussion of gender self-id and what that might mean for very hard-won women\u2019s rights, as well as the rapidly growing number of children exploring gender identity issues, is contentious.\n\n\u2018We know some people would like us to simply censor this entire debate but a similar number think we censor too much. We\u2019re committed to allowing respectful discussion of an issue that is of particular interest to parents.\u2019\n\nThe recent development follows the incident in April this year, when trans activist Stephanie Hayden won a case against Mumsnet as the High Court ordered the site to reveal the name of a user who had abused her online.\n\nUpfield is also not the first company to end its partnership with the site \u2013 Birdseye is reported to have parted ways with Mumsnet, too.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Mumsnet for further comment.\n\nMORE: Roller derby and its wonderful inclusivity sets an example for all sport\n\nMORE: My advice to the queens of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK: Have fun and ignore the trolls\n\nMORE: Miss Trans Queen India crowns its third winner \u2013 and the prize is cosmetic surgery\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Upfield, which owns Flora, has released a statement online to announce the end of its partnership with the parenting forum.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89465047_1570813537.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
