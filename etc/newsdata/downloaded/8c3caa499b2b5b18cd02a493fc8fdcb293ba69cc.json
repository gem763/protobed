He denied pushing her.\n\nGiving evidence at the inquest, Mr Love, who was originally questioned in connection over alleged manslaughter, claimed that Mrs Simmons began shouting at him and his friend, and calling them offensive terms.\n\nHe said he did deny stealing goods to her and said she \"pushed and shoved him in chest.\"\n\nHe denied pushing her but maintained she \"hit\" him and said he then walked away from the shop and \"drank the bottle of wine.\"\n\n\"She wouldn't let me leave the shop, she was standing in front of me\", Mr Love said.\n\nHe admitted at the inquest that he had previously been \"barred\" from the shop for stealing but that he thought the ban had expired when he went back.\n\nBut Mr Butt accused Mr Love of lying, and CCTV which the jury viewed did not show Mrs Simmons obstructing or hitting Mr Love during the confrontation.\n\nA colleague of Mrs Simmons, who had been working at the store for three months, also gave evidence at the inquest.\n\nShe said her colleague had alerted her about the two men who had walked in.\n\nShe said Mr Love was \"using his height\" to intimidate 5ft 2in Hilary after he was confronted.\n\nShe went on to say that Mrs Simmons had experience of confronting shoplifters and \"took it personally\" when people stole from the shop.\n\n\"Hilary wanted him to return whatever he had taken\", she said.\n\n\"It was like someone had stolen from her home, it affected her a lot.\n\n\"She took a lot of pride in her job.\"\n\nShe also denied that Mrs Simmons had hurled abuse at Mr Love.\n\n\"I never heard her use that word. It's not something that she would say.\n\n\"She never made contact with any of them. She was fed up with them coming in and out of the shop taking what they like when they like.\"\n\nTesco has since made changes in the store, with a full-time security guard now on duty and staff have also received further training.\n\nMatthew Butt, who was appearing on behalf of Tesco, said the company offered their \"deep condolences\" to her family and called her a \"valued colleague and friend.\"\n\nThe inquest is expected to last two or three days.", "description": "Hilary Simmons had never had a day off sick in 18 years, since she started working at the branch in Middlesbrough", "authors": ["David Huntley", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Pa", "Evening Gazette"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12476376.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Hilary-Simmons-death.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
