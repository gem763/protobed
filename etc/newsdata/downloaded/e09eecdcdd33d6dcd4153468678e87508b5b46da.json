No further comment would be appropriate at this time.\u201d\n\nIn the event, the match went ahead in Yokohama a few hours after the typhoon ripped through the region. The host nation won 28-21 to qualify for the quarter-finals and send the Scots home.\n\nThe death toll from Hagibis, one of the worst typhoons to hit the country, on Wednesday rose to 74, many drowned by flooding after scores of rivers burst their banks.\n\n\u201cScottish Rugby once again expresses its sincere condolences to the people of Japan and all those affected by Typhoon Hagibis which struck last weekend,\u201d the official added.\n\n\u201cWe have been able to convey our best wishes directly to the Mayor of Yokohama and the Chairman of the Japanese Rugby Union. We stand with the great people of Japan.\u201d", "description": "Scottish Rugby have questioned whether misconduct charges levelled at them for their comments about the potential cancellation of their World Cup clash against Japan last weekend were \"appropriate\".", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441365994&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0CK", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
