Yang is proposing a $1,000 monthly \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d to everyone over the age of 18. Yang says with automation shaving away jobs, the steady stream of money will let unemployed Americans regroup, focus on their education or find other lines of work.\n\nApproximately 36 million Americans could one day lose their job due to automation and artificial intelligence, according to one estimate by the Brookings Institute, which has been described as centrist, conservative and liberal.\n\n(It receives funding from a wide variety of sources, including Google GOOG, +0.05%, Apple AAPL, -0.40%, financial institutions, oil companies and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.)\n\nBut the World Economic Forum says automation and technology could produce 58 million new jobs across the globe.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s debate, Yang said his idea \u201cactually recognizes the work that is happening in our families and our communities. It helps all Americans transition.\u201d\n\nIn another corner is Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who says the federal minimum wage should be $15 per hour (it\u2019s been $7.25 per hour since 2009). A handful of states, including New Jersey, are already phasing in a $15 minimum wage.\n\nBooker said it would put more money in people\u2019s pockets than giving them $1,000 a month. \u201cWe have to start putting the dignity back in work,\u201d he said.\n\nMany other candidates \u2014 including former vice president Joe Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders \u2014 support the $15 minimum wage.\n\nSanders also proposes a federal jobs guarantee. \u201cWe could put 15 million people to work rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our wastewater plants, airports, etcetera,\u201d he said during Tuesday\u2019s televised debate.\n\nThe case for universal basic income\n\nIoana Marinescu, a University of Pennsylvania economics professor who\u2019s studied universal basic income, said minimum wage increases and/or a jobs guarantee would only benefit those in a position to work. It wouldn\u2019t help people who were unable to work because they\u2019re sick or caring for relatives.\n\nUniversal basic income could also let job seekers make good choices instead of jumping at the first offer. \u201cIt allows you to search longer for a higher paying job,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, an experiment involving out-of-work universal basic income recipients in Finland found that the cash influx made them happier in the short term, but it didn\u2019t raise their chance of getting a job.\n\nMarinescu said a $15 minimum wage was a \u201crather good idea at this point,\u201d but in an ideal world, universal basic income was the better approach. \u201cIt\u2019s a more ambitious plan for sure and, therefore, the rub is the cost,\u201d she said.\n\nOne estimate said universal basic income could cost more than $3 trillion a year.\n\nCritics say universal basic income would discourage people from working. Marinescu\u2019s research on Alaskans \u2014 who receive a yearly cash dividend from the state \u2014 showed no effect on employment and a slight increase in part-time work. The 2018 checks were $1,600 per person.\n\nMichael Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, has pointed out that people on both the liberal and conservative sides of the political spectrum are interested in the idea of universal basic income.\n\nThe system could apply to everyone and be simpler than the current welfare system, he said. Universal basic income, \u201cis far less paternalistic than traditional welfare, which often treats the poor like 10-year-olds receiving an allowance,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead of paying cash and trusting people to make their own choices, government benefits, like food and housing subsidies, tell recipients how to spend their money, he added.\n\nThe case for a $15 minimum wage\n\nMichael Reich, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley, preferred Booker\u2019s proposal to Yang\u2019s plan. \u201cA $15 federal minimum wage would do much more to increase incomes and reduce adult and child poverty,\u201d he told MarketWatch.\n\nUniversal basic income \u201cruns the risk of creating a political opportunity to eliminate much better targeted safety net programs,\u201d he said.\n\nReich\u2019s research said higher wages wouldn\u2019t kill jobs. \u201cThat\u2019s because minimum wages are mainly absorbed by very small price increases, mainly in restaurants, and because greater purchasing power stimulates more spending,\u201d he said.\n\nSome conservative thinkers say rising wages would force businesses to cut jobs and worker hours, while others say minimum-wage jobs are merely entry-level stepping stones to something bigger.\n\nA $15 federal minimum wage would increase wages for 17 million workers making less than that amount, according to a July analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan federal agency. An estimated 1.3 million workers would lose their jobs, the office added.\n\nThat outcome, however, would lead to significant job losses and create a \u201csurvival-of-the-fittest\u201d labor market, where only more skilled workers come out on top, said Rachel Greszler, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.\n\nThe case for a federal jobs guarantee\n\nSome researchers say a federal jobs guarantee \u201cwould eliminate cyclical and structural unemployment and provide workers with the dignity and sense of purpose that comes with employment.\u201d\n\nMore workers would mean more spending and, in turn, more money into state and local tax coffers, Duke University and New School researchers wrote last year. A guarantee would also give workers extra traction to get ahead in the job market. \u201cFor private employers to attract employees, they would have to offer a job that is at least as good as the one offered by the government,\u201d they said.\n\nThe program would cost $543 billion a year, they said.\n\nReich said \u201cmost economists would want such a program to be limited to times when unemployment is very high.\u201d The unemployment rate is currently at 3.5%, which is a 50-year low.\n\n\u201cA jobs guarantee at even a $15 minimum wage when the unemployment rate is low is not only superfluous; it runs the risk of creating a new labor market norm of $15 for jobs that currently pay more,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat make us think the government is able to provide a very large number of jobs, and do something effective with all these people?\u201d Marinescu asked. If there\u2019s no convincing answer, supplying unconditional cash in universal basic income could be the better large scale approach, she said.", "description": "One aids everyone who\u2019s able to work, while the other benefits everyone, except at a big cost.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT452_debate_ZG_20191016163937.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
