Seemingly without evidence, she accused the food delivery app\u2019s driver of stealing her order.\n\nBeyond simply putting the driver on blast to her one million followers, the singer tagged Postmates, identified the driver by her first name, and shared a photo of the driver. The since-deleted tweet read, \u201cHey @Postmates this girl Tiffany W. stole my food she lucky I don\u2019t fight no more.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Tiffany told TMZ her side of the story, saying she is humiliated and scared to leave her home out of worry that obsessed Lizzo fans will try to harm her. TMZ also reports that the failed delivery was a miscommunication; Tiffany insists she did not steal Lizzo\u2019s food (she does not even like seafood). According to the report, there was no hotel room number listed on the order. After waiting for 10 minutes, Tiffany was not able to reach the number associated with the Postmates account and left. A spokesperson for Postmates told TMZ, \u201cAs soon as Lizzo reached out, we looked into the matter and quickly resolved the issue. We apologize to Lizzo for any inconvenience.\u201d\n\nLizzo deleted the original tweet promptly after posting it on Sept. 16 and apologized for her lack of consideration. \u201cI apologize for putting that girl on blast,\u201d she tweeted the next day. \u201cI understand I have a large following and that there were so many variables that could\u2019ve put her in danger. Imma really be more responsible with my use of social media and check my petty and my pride at the door.\u201d\n\nFor Tiffany W., however, the performer\u2019s gesture might be too little, too late. Some of the replies to the apology tweet shed light on her safety concerns. \u201cApologize my ass. She gets what she gets,\u201d wrote one user. Another (falsely) stated, \u201cShe stole your food. Stole food. Someone gets a fork in the eye if they steal my food.\u201d At the very least, the emotional trauma of being harassed by anonymous strangers online should not be taken lightly. And though one could argue that few know that feeling better than celebrities themselves, it is important to understand the power dynamics at play.\n\nLizzo clearly did not have malicious intentions, but this situation\u2014which could and should have been handled privately\u2014is about the inherent power imbalance when celebrities decide to publicly air their grievances with non-celebrities; and, in this particular case, the power imbalance between a chart-topping star with a million followers and the low-wage worker delivering her food is staggering enough to transcend mere carelessness.\n\nNot to mention that it\u2019s not the first time Lizzo has blasted someone she disagreed with online. Earlier this year, in spite of receiving generally positive critical feedback, she took issue with one mixed Pitchfork review of her album Cuz I Love You. The reviewer, Rawiya Kameir (who has contributed to The Daily Beast in the past), rated the album a 6.5 out of 10. Lizzo hammered out a scathing, all-caps response on Twitter: \u201cPEOPLE WHO \u2018REVIEW\u2019 ALBUMS AND DON\u2019T MAKE MUSIC THEMSELVES SHOULD BE UNEMPLOYED.\u201d As with PostmatesGate, she deleted the original tweet and walked back her comment, following up to say that she intended it as an invitation to \u201call music journalists\u201d to spend time in the studio with her so she can \u201cunderstand your world as much as you can understand mine.\u201d\n\n\u201c While this scenario too seems to be the result of thoughtless, emotional tweeting, the trend of uber-famous musicians directing petty clapbacks at their critics is starting to get out of control. \u201d\n\nWhile this scenario too seems to be the result of thoughtless, emotional tweeting, the trend of uber-famous musicians directing petty clapbacks at their critics is starting to get out of control. In April, Ariana Grande took aim at the entire entertainment journalism industry with one patronizing tweet after an E! host made a joke about her Coachella duet with Justin Bieber. \u201cPeople are so lost,\u201d she said. \u201cOne day everybody who works at all them blogs will realize how unfulfilled they are and purposeless what they\u2019re doing is and hopefully shift their focus elsewhere. That\u2019s gonna be a beautiful ass day for them! I can\u2019t wait for them to feel lit inside.\u201d\n\nWhen a Chicago-based freelance writer responded with criticism of Grande, Arianators flooded her DMs with threats and insults, some even making horrifying references to the writer\u2019s sexual assault. Grande directly reached out to the writer but did not take responsibility for her fans\u2019 words or actions, instead dismissing them as \u201cupset and passionate\u201d while conceding, \u201cI don\u2019t love that type of behavior.\u201d\n\nNicki Minaj is also guilty of siccing her fans on critics, encouraging hostile and racist language, and in one case indirectly causing a cultural commentator to be doxxed. Most recently, Lana Del Rey got defensive when a respected NPR critic, Ann Powers, wrote that the musician formerly known as Lizzy Grant\u2014with her stage name, Priscilla Presley cat eye, and affinity for pairing flower crowns with floor-sweeping lacy gowns\u2014has a persona.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a little sidenote on your piece,\u201d Del Rey wrote on Twitter. \u201cI don\u2019t even relate to one observation you made about the music. There\u2019s nothing uncooked about me. To write about me is nothing like it is to be with me. Never had a persona. Never needed one. Never will.\u201d In another tweet, she added, \u201cso don\u2019t call yourself a fan like you did in the article and don\u2019t count your editor one either.\u201d The petty response was decidedly not a good look for the \u201cYoung and Beautiful\u201d singer, who has been receiving career-best reviews for her latest album, Norman Fucking Rockwell.\n\nThe power of platforms like Twitter and Instagram to directly connect megawatt celebrities with the lowly ordinary masses is one of the most valuable ways that social media has shaped how we experience music. But since the days of Beatlemania and the Rolling Stones at Altamont, the line between fandom and mob has been a fine one. With great power comes great responsibility, and it is the responsibility of celebrities like Lizzo and Lana to be conscious of the way a few hasty tweets can set off a chain reaction. In 2019, 280 characters is enough to constitute a call to arms.", "description": "With great power comes great responsibility.", "authors": ["Jordan Julian"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569308058/190923-julian-lizzo-lana-tease_uxkmt9", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
