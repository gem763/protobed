Not so in Shadowfall, the new limited time mode running until November 5.\n\nIn the new mode, players drop onto the Kings Canyon map solo at night. The map has a spooky new makeover, by the way. Players fight as usual, but when they die, they become a Shadow\u2014a super-fast zombie with very little health and a deadly touch. Hit another Legend as a Shadow, and they drop onto the map as a Shadow too.\n\nShadows can respawn indefinitely, which means no one\u2019s out of the match \u2019til it\u2019s over. The match ends when there\u2019s ten Legends left. Then their locations are marked for everyone to see, and they have to make it back to an evacuation zone.\n\nIt rules, even though it can be a little frustrating. Once there\u2019s more than one Shadow near you, not getting hit once is hard. In the stream above, you can watch my Kotaku colleague Paul Tamayo playing the new mode while talking with me about horror movies, spooky music, Korean cinema, and Hispanic Heritage Month, which wraps up today.", "description": "Usually, it\u2019s bad to die in Apex Legends, as it is in most games.
