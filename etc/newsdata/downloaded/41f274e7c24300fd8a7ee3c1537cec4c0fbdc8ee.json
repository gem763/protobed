Thousands of TikTok videos tagged with #egirl show girls with thick eyeliner and dyed hair and guys in beanies wearing belt chains \u2013 teens who have embraced an aesthetic separate from the VSCO girls and hipsters sporting Supreme and streetwear.\n\nThe e-girl (and e-boy) are just the latest iteration of mainstream counterculture, similar to the emo and scene kids who posted grainy pictures on Tumblr in the 1990s and early 2000s. These e-teens live on the internet and are fluent in the latest video games, and their goal is to push the boundaries, in spite of what parents and older generations may think.\n\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about the e-girl, Gen Z\u2019s radical antithesis of the Instagram influencer:\n\nThe e-girl is, simply, the modern-day scene girl: Both were created as a counterculture to the mainstream aesthetic and standards of beauty. They are tuned into video games, as well as in internet slang on Discord and YouTube.\n\nsource TikTok\n\nThe basic look of the e-girl and e-boy can be broken down with this starter pack, a group of typical items these teens are frequently found with or associated with.\n\nsource TikTok\n\nAn e-girl or e-boy is commonly sporting:\n\nDyed hair: Frequently, hair is dyed 50-50 between two colors. Sometimes, in pigtails.\n\nFrequently, hair is dyed 50-50 between two colors. Sometimes, in pigtails. Heavy black eyeliner: Dark, thick, winged eyeliner, and sometimes also applied right below each eye to make tiny shapes or icons.\n\nDark, thick, winged eyeliner, and sometimes also applied right below each eye to make tiny shapes or icons.

Part anime-, part goth-inspired clothing: Long layered shirts (perhaps a band t-shirt over a striped long sleeve) or a crop top, belt-loop chains, and A-line skirts or high-waisted cargo pants.\n\nLong layered shirts (perhaps a band t-shirt over a striped long sleeve) or a crop top, belt-loop chains, and A-line skirts or high-waisted cargo pants. Sad, moody music: Think Billie Eilish, or Twenty One Pilots\n\nThe term \u201ce-girl\u201d started off as a derogatory term, used by men to objectify women who they saw as simply looking for male attention online. The first entry of \u201cegirl\u201d on slang-tracking website Urban Dictionary is from June 2009, and it paints a stark picture compared to what e-girl has come to mean in 2019.\n\ncaption Instagram star Belle Delphine, someone who may have been referred to as an e-girl before 2019. source WillNE/YouTube\n\nAnother Urban Dictionary user-submitted definition of e-girl from 2014 referred to her as an \u201cinternet slut\u201d who flirts with guys online for attention. Some may point toward notable Instagram stars like Belle Delphine \u2013 who capitalized on the \u201cthirsty gamer boys\u201d willing to pay $30 for a bottle of her bathwater \u2013 as a symbol of the first wave of the e-girl.\n\nHowever, a new type and definition of e-girl has risen just this year.\n\nE-girls got a lot more attention this summer after the murder of Bianca Devins, a 17-year-old teen who was allegedly killed by a man she knew from Instagram and Discord. Much attention was put on Devins\u2019 online life as part of the e-girl community, where other teens have shared that they\u2019re regularly harassed, threatened, and scared they could be stalked or doxxed in real life.\n\ncaption Bianca Devins. source City of Utica Police\n\nSource: Vice\n\nE-girls have risen into the mainstream in 2019 thanks to TikTok, the short-form video app known as a launching pad for Gen Z\u2019s favorite memes and viral trends. On TikTok, videos tagged with #egirl have more than 1.4 billion views. E-girls and e-boys have established themselves with hundreds of thousands of followers, while others have capitalized solely on parodying the e-girl aesthetic.\n\nsource TikTok\n\nSome have attributed the roots of the e-girl to Tumblr, where a sad and moody aesthetic for the sad and moody teens reigned supreme in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Both eras are defined by teens spending time alone in their rooms, from which a lot of their content is created.\n\nsource TikTok\n\nSource: Vox\n\nThe e-girl aesthetic draws from characteristics of anime, where female characters are often skimpily dressed and fetishized as innocent, helpless victims. One TikToker referred to this as the \u201cI\u2019m Baby\u201d quality in a story for Vox.\n\nsource YouTube; TikTok\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with the \u201cI\u2019m Baby\u201d phrase, it\u2019s a popular line used in memes across the internet to be used by someone who\u2019s incapable or in need of help, or a reason for being unable to get something done.\n\nSource: Vox\n\nThe terms e-girl and e-boy aren\u2019t necessarily used as gender-specific terms. Instead, they\u2019re used to refer to two different type of aesthetics: While the e-boy is a vulnerable\u201dsoftboi\u201d and embraces skate culture, the e-girl is cute and seemingly innocent.\n\nsource TikTok\n\nSource: Vice\n\nAccordingly, the e-girl concept has spurred its own parodies and memes. You\u2019ll find teens in TikToks entering \u201ce-girl factories\u201d or drinking \u201ce-girl juice,\u201d which magically transforms them into a stereotypical e-girl.\n\nsource TikTok\n\nUltimately, the e-girl and the e-boy are the anti-influencers. \u201cScene girls and emo girls were a counter to the preppy, Juicy Couture look of the era (see: Paris Hilton) the way egirls may be a counter to the polished, Facetuned Instagram influencer,\u201d BuzzFeed wrote about e-girls in February.\n\nsource TikTok\n\nSource: BuzzFeed News\n\nThere\u2019s probably no coincidence that e-girls have risen in popularity hand-in-hand with the VSCO girl, the ultra-hipster, ocean-loving teen who found her home on a photo-editing, aesthetic-building app. Where the VSCO girl may be bright and bubbly, the e-girl is quiet and moody.", "description": "Business Insider - Here's what you should know about the subculture of e-girls and e-boys that have emerged on social media in the wake of the era of influencers..
