(Zahra Khozema/CBC)\n\nWhen it came to Brexit, he said, \"the handbrake came off and [artists] did loads of political street art.\"\n\nStuart says he hasn't seen any pro-Brexit work along Brick Lane, though there are some pro-Brexit responses to the anti-Brexit pieces.\n\nA lot of the anti-Brexit street art only started appearing in March 2019, when the initial date to leave the EU was approaching, he said.\n\nA mural of Boris Johnson graffitied as a clown in Brick Lane by street artist ANTLTD. (Zahra Khozema/CBC)\n\nThe U.K. has gone through three prime ministers in three years and the turmoil of uncertainty over a no-deal Brexit has caused economic, trade and immigration repercussions. The current deadline to reach a separation agreement with the EU is set for Oct. 31.\n\nGiven London's largely \"remain\" voting population, Stuart said it made sense that most artists working in Brick Lane are anti-Brexit.\n\n\"Maybe [street artists] didn't engage in it sufficiently because Brexit didn't seem to be probable to them,\" he said, adding that a lot of the Brexit-related art \"came down the mine after the event, when it was too late.\"\n\nMost of the street art depicts pro-Brexit British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in comic roles, such as a clown.\n\n\"It was soul-destroying when that happened,\" street artist Uberfubs said of the 2016 Brexit vote. \"I was in an incredibly low place for weeks and months after. It was a total shock.\"\n\nStreet artist Uberfubs completes her art on the side. (Zahra Khozema/CBC)\n\nUberfubs, who declined to provide her real name because some of her work is on private property without permission, is Irish, but she also holds Canadian nationality through her father.\n\n\"I'd grown up believing that London was cosmopolitan, it was multiracial and full of immigrants,'' she said. \"I had to question what my immigration status was.\"\n\nThough being a street artist is something Uberfubs does on the side, she spends hours lino-printing skulls on tissue, foil and plastic, embellishing them by hand to add texture. The words \"Scrap Brexit\" are printed on some of her recent paste-ups.\n\nStreet artist Uberfubs doing paste-ups of her anti-Brexit art. (Zahra Khozema/CBC)\n\nUberfubs started to put up her art in 2017, because she felt \"frustrated\" about the results of the referendum.\n\n\"Doing street art was a chance to get my voice not heard but seen,\" she said.\n\nShe also regularly protests outside the U.K. Parliament in the evenings.\n\nFor Subdude, another artist who wanted to stay anonymous for the same reason as Uberfubs, street art is an expression of protest which helps him deal with the anger of Brexit and other aspects of global politics.\n\nHe does meme-style paste-ups of political leaders like Boris Johnson and pairs them with puns, like \"Bojo the bozo.\"\n\nStreet artist Subdude doing a paste-up of Boris Johnson as a clown. (Zahra Khozema/CBC)\n\nDuring a stroll through Brick Lane, the self-taught artist pointed out some of his old pieces that had been defaced and scratched off. But he wasn't bothered by it.\n\n\"It's a sign that the art works and the art has provoked something,\" he said. \"To me, it's getting a reaction \u2014 and a lot of the time, the reaction is bad or destructive.\"\n\nDefaced paste-ups of anti-Brexit and other political street art. (Zahra Khozema/CBC)\n\n\"It's hard to avoid the subject, especially as artists. Every piece of art is viewed with a Brexit lens at the minute and that's really sad,\" said Jason Gale, of Quite British Accent, who does penny art with his wife, Sharon.\n\nAfter the referendum, they started leaving pennies on the streets for people to find. Some of the pennies had phrases painted on them: \"Quiet But Angry,\" \"Quite Bloody Angry\" and \"Quash Boris's Ass\" \u2014 all a play on the duo's acronym, QBA.\n\nArtists Sharon and Jason Gale, of Quiet British Accent. (Zahra Khozema/CBC)\n\nThe couple said they painted on out-of-use British pennies because they hold a sense of democracy, history, value and change \u2014 all of which can be viewed politically.\n\nThe Gales ships their art around Europe and the world; with a no-deal Brexit on the horizon, they fear shipping taxes will impact their business.\n\nQuiet British Accent do penny drops in places like Brick Lane for people to find and collect. The pennies are often painted with anti-Brexit messaging. (Zahra Khozema/CBC)\n\nBoth come from artistic backgrounds but they only started working together after their youngest child started secondary school eight years ago.\n\n\"Our kids are now old enough to vote, and they're really angry,\" said Jason.", "description": "Brick Lane has long been a must-see tourist site in London's east end, home to the city's thriving street art scene.\u00a0But as the Brexit deadline looms, new murals and paste-ups appear on its walls daily \u2014\u00a0and it's incubating discussion about the U.K.'s escalating political climate.", "authors": ["Zahra Khozema Is A Research Intern With Cbc News In The London Bureau."], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5318460.1570817908!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/street-art-in-brick-lane.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
