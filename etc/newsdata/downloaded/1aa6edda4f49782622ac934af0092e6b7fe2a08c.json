Williams and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian are rich, famous, and in a marriage with an adorable origin story.\n\nBut the birth of their daughter, Alexis Olympia, was hardly a fairytale.\n\n\u201cWe had every advantage imaginable and it was still a really difficult experience,\u201d Ohanian told Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in an episode of \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d which originally aired in February.\n\nThe hardship inspired Ohanian to advocate for paid paternity leave, a benefit men often forego or lack access to altogether. He has vowed to lobby for national paid family leave legislation and partnered with hygiene company Dove Men+Care on a million-dollar fund to support dads in the meantime.\n\n\u201cI could not imagine going through all of that without knowing I was going to have a job or without knowing I could have time to be with my family to support them fully mentally, physically, emotionally, financially,\u201d said Ohanian, the co-founder of the venture capital firm Initialized Capital.\n\nFederal law requires large employers to offer 12 weeks of unpaid parental leave after the birth of a child. While some states mandate paid family leave and some companies voluntarily offer it, the United States is the only industrialized country that does not ensure paid parental leave.\n\nTennis player Serena Williams arrives with her husband Alexis Ohanian to the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018.

Politicians on both sides of the aisle share the goal of paid family leave, as Ohanian mentioned, but they differ over how to deliver and pay for it. With split control in Congress, a successful bill will need support from both parties.\n\n\u201cThese things take time,\u201d Ohanian said. \u201cBut it is something I think this country needs.\u201d\n\n\u2018A step in the right direction\u2019\n\nIn the meantime, Ohanian has launched a partnership with Dove Men+Care \u2014 a division of the hygiene product company \u2014 on a million-dollar fund to provide grants for new or expectant dads who do not have access to meaningful paid leave.\n\nYahoo Finance All Markets Summit More\n\n\u201cIt's still just a Band-Aid,\u201d Ohanian said. \u201cBut it's a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nThe partnership also includes an awareness and legislative advocacy campaign.\n\n\u201cOf all the things to be advocating for, getting some extra time that you'll never get back with your newborn and your partner \u2014 not a hard sell,\u201d Ohanian said.\n\nHe also suggested that the campaign calls for a shift in the norms of masculinity and fatherhood.", "description": "Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian has vowed to lobby for national paid family leave legislation and partnered with hygiene company Dove on a million-dollar fund to support dads in the meantime.", "authors": ["Max Zahn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ocerGl83g92IbF4HQ9zHKw--~B/aD0zMTEyO3c9NDQ4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c703d9b2000000c036eaaac.jpeg"}
