Other high-flying start-ups, including Uber and Lyft, were also unprofitable when they went public earlier this year. And long before Uber\u2019s I.P.O., its co-founder was ousted amid a growing number of internal scandals. But there are fundamental questions about WeWork\u2019s core business, which is losing money in relatively good economic times.\n\nWeWork\u2019s board members and investors have not yet approached Mr. Neumann about their concerns, these people said. But Mr. Neumann has indicated that he is not interested in relinquishing any more power. He had already agreed to some corporate governance changes that reduce his control, including the naming of a lead independent director and a reduction in his voting power.\n\nIt is unclear how the board could remove Mr. Neumann, who controls the voting power within the company, without his consent. Several investors have floated the idea of threatening Mr. Neumann with legal action, potentially over self-dealing, two of the people said. Some investors want to pursue an investigation of Mr. Neumann\u2019s use of corporate money and well as whether he engaged in drug use on the job. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Neumann transported marijuana on a private plane over international borders.\n\nSpokesmen for both WeWork and SoftBank declined to comment.\n\nFor much of its nine-year history, WeWork was seen as a start-up with seemingly limitless possibilities. It turned the business of co-working \u2014 leasing huge amounts of office space and converting it into work areas that it rents out to professionals and companies \u2014 into an operation with meteoric growth. It is now the single biggest private tenant in Manhattan.", "description": "Some major money managers have reportedly said they wouldn\u2019t invest unless an experienced operator was brought in to replace Adam Neumann.", "authors": ["Michael J.
