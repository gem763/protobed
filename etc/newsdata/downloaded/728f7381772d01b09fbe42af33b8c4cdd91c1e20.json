Beijing has ignored the ruling.\n\nThe Philippines\u2019 film regulation board gave the go-ahead for \u201cAbominable\u201d to run without restrictions and cinemas have shown it from October 2 with no controversy, according to the country\u2019s largest cinema chain.\n\nPhilippine House of Representatives member Lawrence Fortun called for a ban or the scene\u2019s removal.\n\n\u201cAside from the disinformation and confusion it can create, its showing on Philippine soil will also have a negative bearing on our integrity as a country and nation,\u201d Fortun said in a statement on Thursday.", "description": "Manila (AFP) \u2013 Backlash is growing in Southeast Asia over a scene in the animated film \u201cAbominable\u201d that features a map of the South", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/4d31ee_controversial-scene-in-animated-film-shows-map-beijing-shaped-line-backlash-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
