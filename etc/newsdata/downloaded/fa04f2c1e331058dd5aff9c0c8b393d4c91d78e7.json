Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press\n\nDETROIT \u2013 UAW members will see their strike pay increase to $275 per week, effective Sunday.\n\nThe UAW International Executive Board voted in a motion Saturday for the increase, which is a raise from the current $250 per week rate. The strike against General Motors, involving more than 46,000 UAW members, is nearing the end of its fourth week.\n\nThe motion also allows members striking against GM and Aramark to take on part-time jobs without reducing strike pay as long as they maintain their picket duty. Previously, part-time work that exceeded strike pay would void strike pay, the UAW said.\n\nUAW President Gary Jones framed the strike pay increase as one of shared sacrifice.\n\n\u201cUAW members and their families are sacrificing for all of us,\u201d Jones said in a statement. \u201cWe are all standing together for our future. This action reflects the UAW commitment and solidarity to all of our members and their families who are taking a courageous stand together to protect our middle-class way of life.\u201d\n\nUAW strike: GM's redesigned Corvette Stingray to be delayed by strike\n\nUAW strikers with Local 22 take to the streets outside of GM Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Monday, Sept. 16, 2019.

The union presented a counterproposal Friday evening, after a day and a half of sharp exchanges between the two sides.\n\nThe pay increase is likely to be seen as positive news by those on the picket line, even if it's not clear how long the strike will continue.\n\n\"It'll be welcome relief for the strikers, and means a tentative agreement may still be a way off,\" said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor.\n\nFollow Eric D.
