Thousands of Kurdish civilians live in the so-called buffer zone, a senior military source had told Fox News.\n\nThe Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) was \"still shooting all through the night,\" Eubank said. \"So far since [the] cease-fire, no airstrikes here, but artillery and ground attacks.\"\n\nErdogan threatened the Kurds on Saturday during a televised speech, saying they will be slaughtered if they don't pull back from the 20-mile-wide safe zone along the Turkey-Syria border by Tuesday night.\n\n\"We will start where we left off and continue to crush the terrorists' heads,\" Erdogan said.\n\nUS JETS DESTROY ANTI-ISIS COALITION BASE IN SYRIA AFTER WITHDRAWAL, OFFICIAL SAYS\n\nTurkey claims it is living up to the terms of the cease-fire agreement and accused the Kurds of violating it.\n\nThe Turkish Defense Ministry said Kurdish forces carried out 14 \"provocative\" attacks in Ras al-Ayn in 36 hours, according to the BBC.\n\nIn a statement, the SDF said there has been \"no tangible progress\" in solving the issues at the northeast border.\n\nTURKEY-SYRIA CEASE-FIRE: SENIOR US MILITARY SOURCE 'HIGHLY SKEPTICAL' OF DEAL\n\nAs of Friday, 86 civilians had been killed since Turkey launched its military offensive into Syria on Oct. 9, according to a war monitor, the BBC reported.\n\nErdogan claimed the move was to \"neutralize terror threats\" and establish a \"safe zone.\" After carrying out airstrikes, Turkish ground troops later invaded northeastern Syria.\n\nNearly all U.S. troops there have been removed and will be redeployed in the region in the coming weeks.\n\nTRUMPS WARNS ERDOGAN IN LETTER: 'DON'T BE A TOUGH GUY. DON'T BE A FOOL!'\n\nThe U.S. had teamed up with the Kurds to fight ISIS in the region. Some analysts and politicians criticized President Trump for removing America forces, saying it was a \"green light\" for Ankara to invade Syria and fight the Kurds.\n\nTrump said the Turks have been \"warring for many years,\" and that the U.S. does not need to protect war-torn Syria because it's \"7,000 miles away.\"\n\nThe president on Friday claimed \"thousands and thousands\" of lives were being saved in Syria and Turkey due to the cease-fire.\n\nFox News' Griff Jenkins and Jennifer Griffin contributed to this report.", "description": "Turkish President\u00a0Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday promised to \"crush the heads\" of the Kurds in Syria, according to a report.
