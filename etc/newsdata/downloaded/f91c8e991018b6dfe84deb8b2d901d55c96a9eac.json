The rout was begun and finished by Mohamed Elyounoussi and between times Odsonne Edouard also got a double, while James Forrest and Callum McGregor found the mark to finish 6-0 to the good.\n\nThe performance boosted Celtic\u2019s morale ahead of Thursday\u2019s home meeting with Lazio in the Europa League and quelled doubts about their effectiveness after two league setbacks that saw them draw 1-1 with Hibs at Easter Road before losing to Livingston for the first time ever at the Tony Macaroni Arena. Yet by half-time there was an outside chance that their superiority would not earn its merited reward, as the champions made for the dressing room with just one goal scored.\n\nElyounoussi set the tone within two minutes with a low attempt that was gathered easily by Ross Laidlaw, but the Norwegian international midfielder, on loan from Southampton, was simply finding his range as he demonstrated seconds later when Celtic bore down on the County goal once more. This time, Elyounoussi got serious power into a right-footed drive that finished in the far corner of the net.\n\nThe traffic was so emphatically one-way that, by the interval, the Staggies\u2019 only effort on target was an angled effort from Joshua Mullin which was taken comfortably by Fraser Forster. McGregor, meanwhile, battered a drive off a post, Richard Foster headed two Celtic attempts off the line and Laidlaw produced eye-catching saves to deny Edouard and Forrest.\n\nDespite their sustained first-half defiance, County collapsed within moments of the restart, first when they allowed Edouard an unopposed shot eight yards out and permitted the French striker the same latitude four minutes later for a header that took a nick off Liam Fontaine on its way across the line. Edouard\u2019s brace was split by a scoring strike from McGregor when he, too, was unpoliced inside the box in front of Laidlaw.", "description": "Celtic demolished hapless Ross County by scoring half a dozen goals at Parkhead, where the gulf could easily have extended to double figures as Neil Lennon\u2019s players returned to the top of the Ladbrokes Scottish Premiership ahead of Hearts\u2019 meeting with Rangers at Tynecastle on Saturday.", "authors": ["Roddy Forsyth", "Scottish Football Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000213497405-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq_MBhvjUqhIfRd2_dxg_gJxVrDwi3LvLa62XQyE1Z5U4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
