Despite missing the fourth quarter, Landry finished with eight catches for a career-high 167 yards.\n\nLandry\u2019s return means quarterback Baker Mayfield could have his full complement of wide receivers for Monday night\u2019s game at San Francisco.\n\nRashard Higgins is back after missing three games with a knee injury, and Antonio Callaway is back following a four-game league suspension for a substance abuse violation.\n\nTheir absences allowed the Ravens to concentrate on Odell Beckham Jr., which opened things up for Landry and Cleveland\u2019s running game.\n\nLandry has 18 catches for 328 yards this season. He has caught at least two passes in 82 consecutive games, the league\u2019s longest active streak.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Browns star receiver Jarvis Landry has cleared concussion protocol and is practicing.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Withers"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/browns_injuries_football_84778_c0-90-2157-1347_s1770x1032.jpg?98738008d048a1112e90eddad3665a67f7514ab4", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
