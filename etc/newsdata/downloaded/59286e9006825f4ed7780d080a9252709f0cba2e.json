She has not been heard from since.\n\nDetectives had initially believed all 31 men and eight women found in the trailer were Chinese, but on Friday night they said the nationality of the those killed was \u201cnow a developing picture\u201d.\n\nDetails of possible Vietnamese victims emerged as police arrested a third person on suspicion of people trafficking and manslaughter.\n\nMs Pham was known to have planned to attempt to travel to England, according to a human rights group in contact with her family. Her brother told the BBC they had paid \u00a330,000 to people smugglers and her last known location had been in Belgium.\n\nHoa Nghiem, a Hanoi-based activist with Human Rights Space, said the family was worried their daughter was among the victims as \u201cthe last dying text from her was coincidently in time\u201d.\n\nShe shared a screenshot and a translation of the message, which read: \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mom. My path to abroad doesn\u2019t succeed. Mom, I love you so much! I\u2019m dying bcoz I can\u2019t breath... I\u2019m from Nghen, Can Loc, Ha Tinh, Vietnam... I am sorry, Mom\u201d.\n\nThe text was sent at 4.28am on Wednesday in Vietnam, the screenshot shows.

In a statement issued on Friday night, deputy chief constable Pippa Mills said the force \u201cwill not be commenting on any speculation about the nationalities of those who have tragically lost their lives\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe owe it to those who have died to get this investigation right and speculation is not helpful. It may in fact hinder our investigation and its progress.\n\n\u201cWe gave an initial steer on Thursday on nationality, however this is now a developing picture. As such I will not be drawn on any further detail until formal identification processes approved by Her Majesty\u2019s Coroner have taken place.\u201d\n\nThe Vietnamese Embassy in London confirmed it had contacted Essex Police about missing people after receiving requests from worried families.\n\n\u201cThe embassy has not yet received any official confirmation from the British relevant agencies,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nMs Pham had travelled to China and planned to get to England through France, according to Ms Nghiem, who added: \u201cOur contact is getting more alerts that there could be more Vietnamese people in the truck.\u201d\n\nMimi Vu, an expert on trafficking of Vietnamese young people to Europe, said Ms Pham\u2019s texts appeared to be authentic. She told The Guardian: \u201cShe writes her name and where she is from, which is very important, to tell people where she should be buried.\u201d\n\nShe added people were sometimes given fake Chinese passports when they were trafficked through China.\n\nVietHome, a news website for Vietnamese expatriates in Britain, said it had received information about 10 families with missing relatives feared.\n\nThe BBC said it knew of six Vietnamese nationals whose families fear they were among victims on the trailer. The brother of one 19-year-old woman told the broadcaster his sister had called him on Tuesday morning to say she was getting into a container in Belgium and was turning off her phone to avoid detection.\n\nSmugglers have returned deposits paid by families of suspected victims, according to the BBC.\n\nSome 702 Vietnamese people were referred to UK authorities as suspected victims of trafficking and modern slavery last year. The only foreign country with a higher number of victims in Britain was Albania.\n\nPolice investigating the Essex lorry deaths arrested a 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland at Stansted Airport on Friday on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people.\n\nIt followed a couple from Warrington, Cheshire, being detained on suspicion of the same offences overnight on Thursday. Thomas Maher and his wife Joanna, both 38, were reported to be the last known owners of the Bulgarian-registered Scania lorry cab which picked up the refrigerated trailer. They claimed to have sold it to a company in Ireland 13 months ago.", "description": "A missing Vietnamese woman who texted her mother to say \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d is feared to be among 39 people found dead in a refrigerated trailer in Essex.Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent a message saying \u201cI\u2019m dying\u201d at the time the lorry was being shipped from Belgium to the UK on Tuesday night.
