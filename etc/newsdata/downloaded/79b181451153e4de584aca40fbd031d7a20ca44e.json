He was perhaps the most dominant tight end in NFL history with the Patriots precisely because of his unusual combination of size and speed. Humans so big aren\u2019t supposed to move so fast.\n\nNow, suddenly, he\u2019s no longer Gronk-sized.\n\nSince Gronkowski called it quits five months ago, he has undergone a stunning transformation: Rob Gronkowski looks like something Rob Gronkowski used to eat for a midday snack. He has slimmed down to 245 pounds, he says, after being listed at 268 for last season\u2019s Super Bowl. The same guy who once hosted a booze-filled party cruise is now obsessed with juice cleanses and intermittent fasting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to get that crap weight out of me,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more ripped in my life.\u201d\n\nGronkowski spent years wondering something nobody else could possibly wonder: why he wasn\u2019t more ripped. He exercised constantly. He power lifted as much as he physically could. He prided himself on how much he could squat. But it never produced the results he wanted, and immediately after this year\u2019s Super Bowl, he saw a sign that something needed to change.\n\nHe left the Super Bowl\u2014the same game where he made the key catch in New England\u2019s 13-3 win\u2014with his thigh swollen to the size of a tree trunk. Afterward, he could barely move and that night, after celebrating, he cried in bed because the pain wouldn\u2019t let him sleep. It kept him up at night for another three weeks. He couldn\u2019t work out at all, and it was almost two months until he could really run again. In late March, he retired.\n\nThat was the beginning of Gronkowski\u2019s great awakening. He didn\u2019t want to stop working out. He just wanted to approach it differently. And that began with the food.\n\nAll of his favorites had to go. Fried foods, cheeseburgers and subs were cut out. Chicken parm, which he loved to order with extra sauce, may have been the most difficult sacrifice. That was gone too. \u201cYou can\u2019t even talk about it,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause then you\u2019re going to want it.\u201d\n\nAnd then he started sounding like a guy at the local farmers market. He focused on eating anything organic. He was into anything that was plant-based. Some days, juices were the only thing he consumed. He\u2019ll eat a dessert\u2014but not if it\u2019s made with synthetic sugar. \u201cI\u2019ll eat a dessert as long as it\u2019s organic cane sugar.\u201d\n\nGronkowski has even dabbled with intermittent fasting, the diet trend in which people cycle between periods of fasting and eating by going longer periods without consuming food.\n\nBut to lose weight and stay in the type of shape he wanted, he also had to completely change something besides his eating habits: the way he exercises. This year he doesn\u2019t have an NFL season to prepare for. He could train accordingly.\n\nPatriots tight end Rob Gronkowski reacts during overtime of the AFC Championship in January.

He focuses on activities that increase his flexibility. He does a lot of core exercises to improve his stability. (If you want to train like him at home: his favorite involves standing with one foot on a Bosu ball and doing chest passes with a medicine ball.) When he lifts\u2014which he still does\u2014he does more reps of a lighter weight, rather than trying to max out.\n\nGronkowski\u2019s metamorphosis comes at a time when another player unexpectedly left the game to take care of his body. Colts quarterback Andrew Luck retired this week at 29 years old, citing the physical and mental toll that the game took on him.\n\nGronkowski understands. He had nine surgeries throughout his career. While he may not have walked away from nearly as much money as Luck, there are plenty of people who believe Gronkowski still has what it takes to be a game-changing force.\n\nGronkowski hasn\u2019t ruled out that possibility. He says it could be months from now, or even years. It could also be never, depending on how he feels. But there\u2019s one thing he knows for certain.\n\n\u201cI would definitely be eating a lot more if I was playing football,\u201d he said. \u201cBig time.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts What are the best tips for losing weight?
