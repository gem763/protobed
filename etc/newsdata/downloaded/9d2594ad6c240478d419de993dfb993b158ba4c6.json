All spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe attack has also fanned discontent among some in elite circles who believe the crown prince, known in the West by the initials MbS, has sought too tight a grip on power, the sources said. Some of these people said the event has also fuelled criticism among those who believe he has pursued an overly aggressive stance towards Iran.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of resentment\u201d about the crown prince\u2019s leadership, said one of the sources, a member of the Saudi elite with royal connections. \u201cHow were they not able to detect the attack?\"\n\nThis person added that some people in elite circles are saying they have \u201cno confidence\u201d in the crown prince, an assertion echoed by the four other sources and the senior diplomat.\n\nThe crown prince nonetheless has staunch supporters. A Saudi source within circles loyal to the crown prince said: \u201cThe latest events won\u2019t affect him personally as a potential ruler because he is trying to stop the Iranian expansion in the region. This is a patriotic issue, and so he won\u2019t be in danger, at least as long as the father lives.\u201d\n\nA second senior foreign diplomat said ordinary Saudis still want to unite behind MbS as a strong, decisive, dynamic leader.\n\nThe Saudi government media office did not respond to detailed questions from Reuters for this article.\n\nThe crown prince, during a television interview aired Sunday by U.S. broadcaster CBS, said that defending Saudi Arabia was difficult because of the kingdom\u2019s large size and the scale of threats it faces. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging to cover all of this fully,\u201d he said. He also called for \u201cstrong and firm\u201d global action to deter Iran but said he preferred a \u201cpeaceful solution\u201d to a military one.\n\n\n\n\n\nFUELLING RESENTMENT\n\nAt stake is political stability in the world\u2019s largest oil exporter, a key ally of the United States in the Middle East. The crown prince is officially next in line to the throne to his 83-year-old father, King Salman, and is de facto ruler of the country. He has vowed to transform the kingdom into a modern state.\n\nThe 34-year-old crown prince, who is popular among young Saudis, has received praise at home for easing social restrictions in the conservative Muslim kingdom, granting women more rights and pledging to diversify Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-dependent economy. But state control of the media and a crackdown on dissent in the kingdom make it difficult to gauge levels of genuine enthusiasm domestically.\n\nThe September 14 attack set ablaze two of state oil giant Saudi Aramco\u2019s plants, initially knocking out half of the kingdom\u2019s oil production -- 5% of global oil output. Saudi Arabia has said Iran was responsible, an assessment that U.S. officials share. Iranian officials have denied involvement.\n\n\u201cThe magnitude of these attacks is not lost on the population, nor is the fact that he (the crown prince) is the minister of defence and his brother is deputy defence minister, and yet arguably the country has suffered its largest attack ever and on the crown jewels,\u201d said Neil Quilliam, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, a London-based international affairs think tank.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a diminishing confidence in his ability to secure the country \u2013 and that\u2019s a consequence of his policies,\u201d said Quilliam, a specialist on Saudi Arabia and the Gulf. MbS oversees foreign, security and defence policy.\n\nThe attack has fuelled resentment that has simmered since the crown prince came to power two years ago, sweeping aside rivals to the throne and arresting hundreds of the kingdom\u2019s most prominent figures on corruption allegations.", "description": "It has sparked concern\u00a0among several prominent branches of the ruling Al Saud family, which numbers around 10,000 members, about the crown prince\u2019s ability to defend and lead the world\u2019s largest oil exporter, according to a senior\u00a0foreign diplomat and five sources with ties to the royals and business", "authors": ["Reuters Staff Reporters"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ZKVaWv6a7ewWvY1a3f79Q--~B/aD0yOTg7dz00NDk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/24c8502370cd7d139b575101080b6984"}
