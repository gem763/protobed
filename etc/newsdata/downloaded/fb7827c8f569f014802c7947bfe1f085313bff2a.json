REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo\n\nThe iPhone 11, launched on Tuesday for $50 less than last year\u2019s base XR model, was met with a limp response from social media users in Asian markets that are dominated by Huawei Technologies and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS).\n\nLowering the entry price point, a rare move from Apple, was likely an effort to attract buyers in China, where Apple has ceded ground to Huawei due to a surge in support from patriotic Chinese consumers after the Chinese brand was caught in the U.S.-China trade standoff, said analysts.\n\nDespite the reduction, the iPhone 11, and even the higher-end models with more camera lenses, are set to come up short in Asia.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s new phones were no surprise at all. Only tangible change is having an additional camera on their premium model,\u201d said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Seoul-based Cape Investment & Securities.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is noticeable that Apple has made a price cut for the newest iPhone for about $50, which is a very rare move for the company. The move might be aiming to manage and reduce potential risks drawn by the U.S.-China trade war.\u201d\n\nThe iPhone 11 will have two back cameras and is priced starting at $699, down from $749 for the XR last year. On Tuesday, Apple also dropped the price of the XR by $150.\n\nThe more expensive iPhone 11 Pro will have three cameras on the back and starts at $999. The bigger screen iPhone 11 Pro Max starts at $1,099.\n\n(Graphic: Apple unveils new iPhones - here)\n\n\u201cSince we still have to wait a year for 5G, why not just buy Huawei on Monday,\u201d said one user on China\u2019s Twitter-like service Weibo. Huawei and smaller rival Vivo have already released 5G models in China, and Samsung in South Korea.\n\nA meme doing the rounds on Chinese social media featured Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook bragging about the new features and Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei\u2019s consumer business group, shutting him down by pointing out that Huawei has had those features for years.\n\n\u201c(Apple) just added one more camera lens and called it a new feature, meanwhile it is still too pricey,\u201d said a user on South Korea\u2019s Naver.com web portal.\n\nOne of the main draws of the new launch for U.S. buyers - a $5 per month Netflix-like streaming service - will not be available in China.\n\nFEATURES VS PRICE\n\nCounterpoint analyst Neil Shah said the entry price, while lowered by Apple, remains high compared to local rivals. Combined with the lack of 5G, that made the new iPhones \u201cless attractive and future-proof\u201d for Chinese consumers, Shah said, forecasting that Apple will sell 30-35 million iPhones in China this year, down from 63 million phones in 2015.\n\nApple\u2019s share of the China market in the June quarter fell to 5.8% from 6.4% in the year earlier period, according to research firm Canalys. It has also lost ground in South Korea, with market share dropping to 11.2% from 12.5%, according to research firm Strategy Analytics.\n\nIn India, a market that Apple has said is key for growth, reaction to the new phones was muted as well.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe customers will buy more iPhones now because the new models sport more cameras, it will not move the needle much for them,\u201d said Navkendar Singh, research director at IDC India.\n\nCustomers in India who care more about owning Apple-branded phones over the latest model are now likely to buy the discounted XR instead, Singh said.\n\nStill, some analysts said that Apple\u2019s decision to lower the entry price for the new iPhone, one of the most discussed topics on Weibo on Wednesday, was a positive sign.\n\n\u201cWe think the lower iPhone 11 price point and trade-in program will help promote upgrades, specifically in China, while the Apple Arcade and TV+ offerings will help accelerate services growth,\u201d CFRA analyst Angelo Zino said in a research note.\n\nThe new phones will be available to order on Friday and start shipping Sept. 20.", "description": "Apple Inc's new, lower priced iPhone that comes with a faster processor but lacks 5G technology disappointed Asia, where cheaper and feature-packed handsets from rivals are already available.", "authors": ["Josh Horwitz", "Heekyong Yang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428576433&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A09Z-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
