What we\u2019ll have to see is a couple of quarters of investment growth to see it as a sign that the economy improving.\u201d\n\nPienaar believes the boost in machinery investment will be carried over to the next quarter as IPP projects continue with construction.\n\nPetri Redelinghuys, a trader and the founder of Herenya Capital Advisors, said the high likelihood that South Africa will retain its investment grading from rating agency Moody might have bolstered investment.\n\nHe, however, agrees with Pienaar that a few months of increased investment is required to see it as a positive sign in the economy.\n\n\u201cI think only then can we comfortably say that it is a sign that the ship is turning around. Until then, it could just be an outlier,\u201d Redelinghuys said.", "description": "Investment has to grow for a couple of quarters to see it as a positive sign for the economy, one analyst said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9354/e119bf9517f545a8996b005981456ef2.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
