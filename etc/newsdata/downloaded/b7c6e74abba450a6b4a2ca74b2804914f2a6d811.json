They\u2019ve got a good, young squad. They\u2019ve got a very good manager.\n\n\u2018The signs at Leicester at the moment are a lot more positive than they are at Old Trafford.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s got an opportunity to potentially play Champions League football with Leicester. He\u2019s got an opportunity to be part of something that is growing, that is building.\n\n\u2018Leicester at the moment look more than likely to finish higher than Manchester United and many others in the Premier League this year.\u2019\n\nLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers was realistic on the future of one of his star players, admitting that Maddison would be very tempted would United come calling.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been fortunate that I\u2019ve been at Liverpool where I understand the draw of that type of club,\u2019 Rodgers said.\n\n\u2018Liverpool and Manchester United are two of the biggest clubs by far.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s other great clubs, there\u2019s big clubs, but those two, in terms of worldwide status, are above the other clubs.\n\n\u2018There are other great clubs that are trying to catch them up but those two, in my experience, are a level above.\n\n\u2018So whenever a player gets an opportunity to go to a club like that, to experience that type of pressure, that expectation \u2013 and of course there\u2019ll be a financial side to it as well, let\u2019s be real \u2013 that as a package in a short career is maybe something that is too hard to turn down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I understand it, I get it.\u2019\n\nMORE: The two reasons Manchester United expect to sign James Maddison from Leicester City\n\nMORE: Leicester\u2019s Jamie Vardy mocked by Burnley fans over wife Rebekah\u2019s row with Coleen Rooney", "description": "Leicester City midfielder has been linked with a big money move to Manchester United, but former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson has urged him to stay where he is.
