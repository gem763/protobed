Nevertheless, he has made clear he does not want an extension\n\n- Speaking after the defeat, Johnson said he would pause the legislation while EU decides on the delay request.\n\n- The legislative process could be restarted if a new programme motion is agreed by parliament.\n\n- If the process resumes, the government will still have to see off attempts to amend the bill, potentially changing the terms of Britain\u2019s withdrawal.\n\n- Lawmakers have proposed changes including adding in a requirement for a second referendum and forcing the government to seek a long-term customs union with the EU.\n\nOVER TO EU\n\n- Johnson said: \u201cThe EU must now make up their minds over how to answer parliament\u2019s request for a delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will speak to EU member states about their intentions. Until they have reached a decision we will pause this legislation. Let me be clear, our policy remains that we should not delay,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe government must take the only responsible course and accelerate our preparations for a no-deal outcome,\u201d he said.\n\n- Johnson had earlier warned lawmakers that he would abandon the legislation if the EU decides to delay Brexit until Jan. 31, 2020. He would then try to get parliament to agree to hold an early election.\n\n- However, he has not said he would ditch the bill if the EU granted a shorter extension.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nThis leaves open the possibility that the EU agrees a short extension to allow parliament more time to scrutinise the bill and Johnson proposes a new slightly longer timetable to lawmakers.\n\nThis would break Johnson\u2019s \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to leave the EU on Oct. 31, but could still allow him to say in a subsequent election campaign that he had delivered Brexit.\n\n- If the EU does not grant Britain more time, the country will leave without a deal on Oct. 31.", "description": "The British parliament rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson's attempt to fast-track a Brexit law through parliament, making a delay beyond the Oct. 31 exit date almost inevitable, and casting the entire EU divorce into doubt.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444159731&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1HQ", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
