Mr Swartz redesigned the entire interior\n\nBy realigning the bathroom and kitchen, Mr Swartz was able to re-zone and effectively separate the living and sleeping spaces, giving the allusion the apartment is bigger than it actually is.\n\n'We decided it was really important to have that strong divide between sleeping and living,' Mr Swartz said in a promotional video for the property.\n\n'The timber screen creates a visual separation from the bedroom to living area while also still allowing natural light to pass through it when its closed.\n\n'But at night it can slide through to open up the sleeping space.'\n\nThe kitchen itself is compact, with all amenities tucked away behind white cupboards\n\nSeparating the bedroom, which has enough space for a queen bed, is a hidden door which leads to the bathroom and walk in wardrobe\n\nIn another strategic move to maximise perceived space, Mr Swartz angled the wall next to the bed rather than blocking it off in order to show off the full width windows in the bedroom and pick up the light.\n\nThe apartment is one of 40 in the building, and is advertised on Airbnb as an award winning refurbished build suitable for two people.\n\nMost dates for at least the next two months are completely booked and is flush with five-star reviews.\n\nThe apartment, named Boneca by its owners - which means doll's house in Portugese - was awarded apartment or unit of the year for 2018 after its renovation.\n\nIt was also shortlisted for the Interior Design Excellence Awards in the same year.", "description": "The unassuming red-brick block sits in prime Sydney real estate in the harbourside suburb of Rushcutters Bay.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/01/19765020-0-image-a-9_1571187086519.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
