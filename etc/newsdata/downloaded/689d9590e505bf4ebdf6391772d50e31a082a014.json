Consumers are more keenly aware of what\u2019s in store and are actively hunting down bargains. A survey by Nielsen shows that 75% of South Africans now know the prices of the grocery items they buy and notice changes in price, from 69% in 2017.\n\nThat may mean that this is the peak for South Africa's biggest malls, which ranked by square metres of space are:\n\n1. Fourways Mall, Johannesburg, 178,000m 2\n\n2. Menlyn Park, Pretoria, 177,000m 2\n\n3. Gateway Theatre of Shopping, Durban, 150,000m 2\n\n4. Sandton City, Sandton, 141,390m 2\n\n5. Mall of Africa, Midrand, 131,000m2\n\nSee how South Africa\u2019s biggest malls have transformed.\n\nUsing satellite imagery from Planet Lab, which gathers images from 204 bread-loaf sized satellites orbiting Earth, we were able to look at how five of South Africa\u2019s largest malls have changed. In some cases we could go back as far as 10 years ago.\n\n5. Mall of Africa\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/div&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\nMall of Africa is South Africa's largest shopping mall ever built in a single phase, with over 131,000m2 of retail space. It is home to 300 shops. Located in Waterfall City, Midrand, construction started in October 2012 and it opened in April 2016.\n\n4. Sandton City\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/div&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\nThis metropolis was developed from the ground up in 1973. In 2011, Sandton City embarked on a R1.77 billion expansion, now covering over 146,000m2 and become the centre of \u2018Africa\u2019s Richest Square Mile\u2019.\n\nSandton City was constructed and developed by Rapp and Maister on behalf of the Liberty Group. In 2015, hundreds of millions were spent on further interior redevelopment.\n\n3. Gateway Theatre Shopping Centre\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/div&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\nSituated in the Umhlanga Ridge New Town Centre and boasting more than 280 stores, Gateway Theatre Shopping Centre is the third largest shopping retail outlet in South Africa.\n\n2. Menlyn Shopping Centre\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/div&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\nOriginally built in 1979, Menlyn Park Shopping Centre can be found in the capital city of Tshwane. Major updates were made in 1988 and then 1998 and 2000.\n\nThe latest R2.5 billion redevelopment which expanded the centre to 177,000m2 was completed in 2016.\n\n1. Fourways Mall\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/div&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\nThe mall features a staggering 52 entrances for vehicles and pedestrians, including an impressive, but invisible, trucking and logistics tunnel underneath the building.\n\nIt\u2019s the biggest shopping and entertainment destination in SA.\n\n\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The new version of Fourways Mall, now the biggest shopping centre in South Africa, was unveiled to the public in August.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9193/626f683ec3ca4935b0205449afe8b59f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
