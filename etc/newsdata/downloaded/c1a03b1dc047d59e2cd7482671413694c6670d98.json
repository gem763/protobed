Don\u2019t be shy about adding the entire tablespoon of pepper, as it balances out the richness of the beef and adds a lightly spicy bite to the dish. A quick rub of garlic, brown sugar, salt, pepper and cornstarch seasons the beef; the cornstarch helps tenderize the beef and later imparts a silky texture to the sauce. Feel free to marinate the beef up to 8 hours ahead and cook when you're ready. If leftovers remain, tuck them into a crunchy baguette or roll them into a wrap.", "description": "Coarsely crushed black peppercorns star in this quick weeknight dish, which is built primarily from pantry staples Don\u2019t be shy about adding the entire tablespoon of pepper, as it balances out the richness of the beef and adds a lightly spicy bite to the dish A quick rub of garlic, brown sugar, salt, pepper and cornstarch seasons the beef; the cornstarch helps tenderize the beef and later imparts a silky texture to the sauce", "authors": ["Sue Li", "Ali Slagle", "Julia Moskin", "Krysten Chambrot", "Sam Sifton", "Melissa Clark", "Alison Roman", "Eric Asimov", "Robert Simonson", "Samin Nosrat"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/dining/sl-cabbage-stir-fry/sl-cabbage-stir-fry-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
