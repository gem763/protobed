Google\u2019s new Chromebook just leaked? An entire hands-on article and video from a reputable source like 9to5Google? Sighs.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first we\u2019ve heard about the Pixelbook Go, which 9to5Google extensively covered last month. But this is the first time we\u2019ve gotten such a thorough look at the device. Keeping in mind that the leaked device is an alleged prototype with features subject to change \u2013 and that there\u2019s always a tiny chance it\u2019s an elaborate fake \u2013 here\u2019s what we know so far.\n\nThe Chromebook features a unique new design with a \u2018grippy\u2019 ridged surface at the bottom of the device that apparently feels pretty nice to hold. The bottom in 9to5\u2018s prototype is kind of coral, but the rest of the laptop has a soft-touch finish akin to the Pixel 2, with a subtle \u2018Not Pink\u2019 coloration like the Pixel 3 (Black is the other option). The report does not clarify if the laptop is metal or plastic, but it appears to be metal from the images.\n\nOne the laptop up reveals a fairly standard MacBook-esque device, albeit a little more \u2018bubbly\u2019 with more rounded corners and keys, as well as some rather chunky bezels above and below the display. The keyboard appears to be quite good \u2013 on par with or better than the original Pixelbooks \u2013 while the trackpad isn\u2019t as remarkable, but \u201cnot shabby at all.\u201d\n\nCredit: 9to5Google\n\nThe device is expected to come in several configurations, but the model in the leak featured a 1080P touchscreen, 8GB of RAM, and an Intel Core M3 (generation not specified). The device is expected to be configurable up to a 4K display, an Intel Core i7, 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage. There\u2019s a headphone jack and two USB-C ports on board as well, but there\u2019s no fingerprint reader or stylus compatibility.\n\nAnd that\u2019s about it. The device seems attractive, but unless Google has some secret software up its sleeve, it doesn\u2019t appear too remarkable. Price will likely be what makes or breaks this device. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this is a budget option and Google has a proper successor to the original Pixelbook lined up for next week.\n\nI mean, surely there will be something left to reveal next week\u2026. right?
