Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) knows how to use social media. We all know that. I mean give credit where credit is due. She knows how to engage with that audience, which so happens to be very concerned about global warming. If it\u2019s not ranting about white guys wearing sombreros, white women serving burritos, health care, college debt, or any off-shoot of the political correctness realm\u2014global warming is the next action item on the liberal whine-fest.\n\nAOC is the starting quarterback for the Green New Deal, a multi-trillion-dollar project that seeks to pretty much destroy the American economy. With a price tag of $15-30 trillion, and that\u2019s not including the Medicare for All proposal, the Green New Scam seeks to ban the internal combustion engine, retrofit every building to be energy efficient, and get off all fossil fuels\u2026within a decade. Talk about a great leap forward. Oh, and this is the only way to save the planet, which AOC and her ilk say could end within 12 years or so. And yet, these were the same people who thought global cooling would kill us off in the 1970s. they were wrong. In fact, every doomsday scenario peddled by the Earth Day cult has been wrong. We\u2019re going to roll the dice and cannibalize trillions in economic growth over this? No. sorry\u2014condemning millions of American families to destitution is not an option\u2014ever. And anyone can see that these late-night rants by AOC are just a push for backdoor socialism, which appears to be at the core of the environmental agenda.\n\nSocialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) goes into full freak out mode over climate change, claims:\n\n\n\n-every coastal city going to be underwater\n\n\n\n-majority of the country is going to experience drought\n\n\n\n-won't be able to grow food due to scorching sun\n\n\n\n-everyone will die pic.twitter.com/E8dsS54chy \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) August 28, 2019\n\nTim wrote about her latest blowup. Droughts, coastal cities flooding, the inability to grow food...if you think this sounds like the plots from Interstellar and A.I. Artificial Intelligence, you\u2019d be correct. Again, this crew has spewed the same nonsense since the 1970s\u2014all of which never came true. And it won\u2019t happen here either (via The Federalist):\n\nIn part of her video, Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cEven when I was on vacation, I woke up in the middle of the night at 3:30 in the morning just concerned about climate change.\u201d As the video continued, Ocasio-Cortez said diseases are going to escape from frozen glaciers and humans will \u201ccontract\u201d them. The young representative continued her fear-mongering approach when she said that \u201cevery coastal city will go underwater,\u201d the Midwest and large swaths of the rest of the country will experience drought, and the sun will scorch Earth so much that we won\u2019t be able to grow crops. [\u2026] In her video monologue, Ocasio-Cortez then recommends her solution for combatting the inevitable, earth-shattering climate change: overhauling the entire economy. She promoted her goal to \u201cdecarbonize\u201d the entire economy, a plan that would cost about $16.2 trillion to over $20 trillion, depending upon the estimations.\n\nIt\u2019s not about saving the earth. It\u2019s about destroying America from within and its families that will pay the price.", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:06:33AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/151/43bd1f91-e9dd-4401-bb94-001dba19eeee.png"}
