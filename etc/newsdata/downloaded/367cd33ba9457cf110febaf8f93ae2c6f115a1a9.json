The ball fell toward the ground in foul territory between first base and home plate.\n\nTexas first baseman Ronald Guzman charged the ball, apparently ready to secure the second out of the inning. But at the last second he pulled back his glove in an obvious effort to let the ball drop.\n\nThe droning minutiae over \"playing the game the right way\" found a new target as Mike Minor approached 200 strikeouts. (Reuters)\n\nMinor leaves game with one out remaining\n\nMinor proceeded to strike out Owings to secure the milestone. He immediately left the game with two outs in the ninth inning after throwing 126 pitches.\n\nIt\u2019s crystal clear what was at play here.\n\nCora: Happy our guys play \u2018the right way\n\nRed Sox manager Alex Cora was salty about the strategy after the game, with thoughts on \u201cplaying the game the right way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy our guys are playing the game the right way,\u201d Cora told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re playing hard until the end. It\u2019s been two weeks we\u2019ve been eliminated, but we\u2019ve been going at it the right way.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I ask. I don\u2019t manage the Rangers.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWoodward: Don\u2019t swing at first pitches, then\n\nOn the Rangers side of things, manager Chris Woodward \u201cdidn\u2019t love\u201d the intentional drop, but was agitated that Red Sox batters had the gall to swing at first pitches in the eighth, an inning that lasted only three pitches.\n\n\u201cI didn't love the idea that we dropped the popup at the end,\u201d Woodward told reporters. \u201cBut on the other side of that, they swung at three pitches in a row in the eighth inning down by two. If they have any beef with that \u2014 obviously I'm pretty sure Cora did \u2014 they chose to not try and win the game as well. They were trying to keep him from striking a guy out.\u201d\n\nMinor himself had a scathing response to a critical Boston sports writer.\n\nAsk me if I care Pete \u2014 Mike Minor (@MikeMinor36) September 26, 2019\n\nWhatever\n\nThe one lesson here is that even when the games are meaningless, baseball will be baseball.\n\nEven 159 games into lost seasons long lost, opposing sides will bicker over the meaningless minutiae of what constitutes \u201cplaying the game the right way.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The droning minutiae over \"playing the game the right way\" found a new target as Mike Minor approached 200 strikeouts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/10G6RcY_MN5WrtQIwBOqkQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTcuNg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fhfa59NRKkbqo_QVYSBL0w--~B/aD0yODgyO3c9NDMwMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/90e63530-e0b1-11e9-b4bd-24a5c19bb7b7", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
