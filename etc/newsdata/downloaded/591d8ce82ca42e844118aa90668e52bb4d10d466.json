Communication with the lander was lost when it was just 1.3 miles from the lunar surface.\n\nVikram was subsequently spotted on the lunar surface by the space agency's Chandrayaan-2 orbiter and technicians have since been working to establish a connection with it. However, they are in a race against time to contact the lander, which contains the six-wheeled Pragyan rover.\n\nINDIA LOSES CONTACT WITH VIKRAM PROBE IN MOON LANDING ATTEMPT\n\nVikram and its rover have a lifespan of one lunar day, which is equal to 14 Earth days, according to ISRO. This means that the probe will reach the end of its life on Sept. 20.\n\nIt is not yet clear what damage the lander suffered during its descent. The U.S., Russia and China are the only other countries to have successfully landed on the Moon.\n\nSpaceflight Now reports that NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was scheduled to fly over the Vikram landing site on Sept. 17 and capture images of the probe on the Moon\u2019s surface.\n\nINDIA FINDS MISSING VIKRAM PROBE ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON\n\nISRO\u2019s Chandrayaan-2 orbiter will continue its mission for a year.\n\nThe roughly $140 million Chandrayaan-2 mission is intended to study permanently shadowed moon craters that are thought to contain water deposits that were confirmed by the Chandrayaan-1 mission in 2008.\n\nEarlier this year, Israel's uncrewed Beresheet spacecraft crashed during a Moon landing attempt.\n\nVIKRAM MOON LANDER: THE ANXIOUS WAIT FOR A SIGNAL FROM LUNAR SURFACE\n\nThe Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft carrying the Vikram Lander launched from Sriharikota in southern India on July 22.\n\nIndia's first lunar mission, Chandrayaan-1, orbited the Moon in 2008 but did not land there. It did, however, launch an impact probe that was intentionally crashed into the Moon.\n\nChandrayaan-1 operated for 312 days.\n\nAPOLLO 11\u2019S MICHAEL COLLINS RECOUNTS THE CREW\u2019S THREE-WEEK QUARANTINE ON THEIR RETURN FROM THE MOON\n\nThe Moon looms large for a number of countries\u2019 space programs. China, for example, became the first country to successfully land a probe on the far side earlier this year when the Chang\u2019e 4 lander reached the lunar surface on Jan. 2.\n\nThe U.S. also has its sights set on the celestial satellite and plans to land American astronauts, including the first woman, by 2024.\n\nThe Artemis program will also establish a sustainable human presence.\n\nAPOLLO 11: HOW 'DUMB LUCK' SAVED ICONIC MOON PHOTOS FROM BEING DESTROYED\n\nNASA recently revealed details of its vision for the Artemis Moon Lander.\n\nSpeaking at Kennedy Space Center on the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing on July 20, Vice President Pence announced that the Orion capsule that will take American astronauts back to the satellite is ready.\n\nSince Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the surface, only 10 more men, all Americans, have walked there.\n\n50 YEARS AFTER APOLLO 11, NEIL ARMSTRONG'S SONS DESCRIBE THE DAY THEIR DAD WALKED ON THE MOON\n\nAt a White House event in July, Aldrin voiced his disappointment over America\u2019s space progress since the days of Apollo 11.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News\u2019 Chris Ciaccia, Morgan Cheung and The Associated Press contributed to this article.\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", "description": "The Indian Space Research Organization lost contact with the unmanned probe when it was in the final stage of an audacious Moon landing attempt on Sept. 6.", "authors": ["James Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/Chandrayaan2ScreenshotMoon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
