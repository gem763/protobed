Bangladesh announced a 15-man T20 squad last week with Shakib set to lead the side.\n\n\u201cFrom the National Cricket League to first-class (cricket), national team preparations, internationals... everything is included,\u201d Shakib told a news conference in Dhaka.\n\n\u201cApart from the Under-19s and the other age-group teams, all first-class and national teams are included. When the demands are met, normal service will resume.\n\n\u201cAll of us want cricket to improve. Some of us will play for another 10 years, some for four to five years. We want to create a good environment for the players who will come after us, so Bangladesh cricket can move forward.\u201d\n\nAccording to ESPNcricinfo here demands include reversing the board's decision to scrap the franchise-based model in the Bangladesh Premier League (a T20 tournament) and removing the salary cap in the Dhaka Premier League (a 50-over competition).\n\nHigher match fees for first class cricketers was also on their list of demands.\n\nA BCB spokesman told Reuters the board would not make a statement until they were formally presented with the list of demands.\n\nShakib said the women\u2019s team were not part of the boycott but that they were welcome to join them if they also had issues that needed to be addressed.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to include the women cricketers here, because it was done in a rush,\u201d Shakib added. \u201cIf they have any demands, they are most welcome to join us.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they have grievances too. If they come to us and join us, we will be able to put forward their demands too.\u201d", "description": "Bangladesh's cricketers will be on an indefinite strike until a list of demands are met by the country's cricket board (BCB), skipper Shakib Al Hasan said on Monday, putting next month's tour of India in doubt.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443371635&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K128", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
