Operators can evolve their network now to a hardware agnostic, cost effective solution and be ready for 5G with a software upgrade.\n\nMavenir\u2019s OpenRAN extends virtualization to the edge of the network and provides strategic differentiation by enabling multisource Remote Radio Units (RRUs) to interwork with the virtualized Cloud Base Band software over ethernet Fronthaul (FH), using the O-RAN open interface overcoming the traditional constraints of the proprietary walled garden specifications used by the other traditional equipment vendors. Highlights include:\n\nSupport for O-RAN 7.2 Radio Architecture with Open Interfaces\n\nSupport for 3GPP Split 2 Architecture with Open Interfaces\n\nScalability and independence from proprietary hardware, faster time to market of new features\n\nAbility to centralize the baseband Distributed Unit (DU) and Central Unit (CU) resources\n\nEnable dynamic scaling of capacity growth, operational & maintenance cost savings and simplicity\n\n\u201cWe are continuing our tradition of leading the virtualization of key network applications. With the experience of being the first to successfully launch virtualized VoLTE, VoWiFi, IMS core, RCS, SBC, EPC, as well as virtualized Security Gateway, Home NodeB Gateway, etc over the last 10 years, we are now ready to bring vRAN technology to market,\u201d said Pardeep Kohli, President, and CEO of Mavenir. \u201cOperators need alternatives to the traditional vendors, particularly in countries with restrictions, and as a U.S-based and headquartered company we are that alternative.
