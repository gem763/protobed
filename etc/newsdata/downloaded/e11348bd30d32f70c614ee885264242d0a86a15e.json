Millions of families and businesses cannot plan for the future,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson\u2019s new motion, expected to be debated and voted on Tuesday, is expected to propose that a call for an early election can be passed by a simple majority.\n\nJohnson runs a minority Conservative government. He is pushing for a general election to try to secure a majority in parliament which would enable him to get the required support to approve his divorce deal with Brussels.\n\nEU leaders earlier on Monday approved a third extension to the Brexit process until January 31, 2020. Johnson begrudgingly accepted this but urged them not to grant any more time after that.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "British lawmakers on Monday blocked an attempt by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to hold an early general election on December 12", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/British-PM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
