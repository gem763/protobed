That was the overriding concern,\u201d his spokesman told the AP.\n\nA Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles spokeswoman told the AP the department has received the request but hasn't responded.\n\nAndrea Senteno, an attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which has contested the executive order, told the AP that motor agency vehicle records are \"bad at determining when someone is not a citizen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Census Bureau usually plans for these types of big changes in their operations many, many years in advance, but they don\u2019t have enough time right now to actually plan and provide clear information to the public about how they are going to use these administrative records,\u201d Senteno said. \u201cThey\u2019re flying by the seat of their pants right now.\u201d\n\nThe AP reported that a request published last month in the Federal Register said records on recipients of public programs would be used for the Census and other research to \u201cimprove efficiency and accuracy in our data collections, and to improve measures of the population and economy.\u201d\n\nThe request doesn't explicitly request citizenship information, but the AP reported that some people who work with the bureau on state data think it could be in response to Trump's executive order.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the Census Bureau for comment.\n\nThe bureau told the AP in a statement that it began asking for state records in 2016 to help with the 2020 Census and other surveys. These records include birthdates, addresses, race, Hispanic origin and citizenship status.\n\nIt reportedly did not answer questions as to why it was asking for information on drivers' licenses or why a new request was made last month.", "description": "The U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/2020censuscitizenship_protesters_062719getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
