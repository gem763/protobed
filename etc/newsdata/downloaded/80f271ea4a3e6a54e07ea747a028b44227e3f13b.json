So where is the quality of life improvement?\"\n\nIneffective policy measures, powerful developers and a limited supply of land have led to a huge shortfall of housing in Hong Kong, according to property experts, with an average waiting period of more than five years for public housing.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, in a speech last year, vowed to ease the shortage by boosting land supply through reclamation and redevelopment, and earmarking 70% of housing on the new Lantau islands for public housing.\n\nOpponents, including planners, conservationists and some Christian groups, say the plan - estimated to cost at least HK$500 billion ($64 billion) - is unnecessary, and will drain Hong Kong's financial reserves and hurt the environment.\n\n\"The land to be created in this project far exceeds the population and land demand projections,\" said Brian Wong of advocacy group Liber Research Community.\n\n\"Alternate land supply options could easily replace this project without the environmental problems,\" he said.\n\nA spokeswoman from the Civil Engineering and Development Department said that reclamation cost is comparable to the cost of taking over private farming land in Hong Kong.\n\n\"The government has taken into account the conservation of the natural environment and ecology, and we will conduct the requisite environmental impact assessments,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIRREVERSIBLE IMPACTS\n\nThe former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997 originally comprised rustic farming and fishing villages.\n\nNow, with more than 7.4 million people crammed in a 1,104-square-kilometre (426 sq mile) area, the city is one of the world's most densely populated places.\n\nThe frustration over lack of housing in one of the world's wealthiest cities is seen in what began as a protest against a bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial and has evolved into demands for greater democracy.\n\n\"The protests are a manifestation of the growing unhappiness with the lack of consensus, lack of transparency, and dissatisfaction with the government's heavy-handedness,\" said Yam.\n\n\"It's all of one piece. And this plan to build artificial islands is a part of that.\"\n\nHong Kong has long reclaimed land from the sea, and also has a plan for underground development to free up space.\n\nBut the city is not short of land, and only needs better land-use planning to meet its needs, according to the Citizens Task Force on Land Resources, a network of urban planners, researchers and land rights activists.\n\nThe government's push for creating new land supply is based on \"inflated assumptions regarding population growth and space requirements\", and ignores the prediction that the city's population is expected to peak in 2043, the organisation said.\n\nNearly 4,000 hectares of land can be unlocked through better planning from existing resources such as the largely-rural New Territories in the north, according to the Citizens Task Force.\n\n\"Low-lying areas such as artificial islands are highly vulnerable to extreme weather and tides and storm surges, and more frequent flooding,\" said Paul Zimmerman, chief executive of Designing Hong Kong, an urban think tank.", "description": "Not long after Tom Yam returned to his native Hong Kong after 40 years abroad, he picked Lantau Island to settle in, drawn to its laid-back villages, wooded trails and scenic beaches that seemed a world away from the bustle of the city.
