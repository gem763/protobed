Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was reportedly among those who died in the attack\n\nPresident Donald Trump held a morning press conference on Sunday and confirmed that al-Baghdadi 'died like a dog' in the extended firefight with US forces\n\n'Last night the United State brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead,' Trump said at around 9am EST Sunday from the Diplomatic Reception Room, where just a week earlier he announced a ceasefire between Turkey and the Kurds.\n\n'He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization anywhere in the world.\n\n'I got to watch much of it. No personnel were lost in the operation, while a large number of Baghdadi's fighters and companions were killed with him,' Trump said during his rare Sunday morning remarks.\n\n'He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way,' Trump continued, adding that Baghdadi took three of his children down with him. 'They were led to certain death.'\n\n'He reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast. the tunnel had caved in on it, in addition. But test results gave certain, immediate and totally positive identification. It was him. The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him,' he detailed.\n\nThe president said al-Baghdadi had been under surveillance for a few weeks before the raid. Few top officials were aware of the impending attack.\n\nTrump said he does not regret his decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria, which opened the way for Turkey to invade and target Kurdish forces.\n\nThe president teased on Twitter Saturday night: 'Something very big has just happened!'\n\nA Turkish official said al-Baghdadi arrived at area of the raid 48 hours beforehand and was with his two wives, who were both reportedly wearing explosive devices, as well as his children.\n\nThe wives and children are presumed dead, along with several others.\n\nKurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said on Sunday they had worked with the US on a 'successful' operation against Islamic State.\n\n'Our strong and effective operations once again confirm our strength and determination to go after (Islamic State),' the head of the SDF's media office said.\n\nThe ISIS leader has been among US and Europe's force's most wanted figures since his chilling call to arms in 2014, which saw a shift away from the mass casualty attacks carried out by al-Qaeda in favor of smaller-scale acts of violence.\n\nAl-Baghdadi, the leader of the so-called Islamic caliphate, reportedly blew himself up during the targeted attack on his lair in Syria's Idlib province in the early hours of Sunday morning\n\nPresident Trump is seen in the White House Situation Room alongside national security adviser Robert O'Brien, Vice President Mike Pence, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen Mark Milley and Brig Gen Marcus Evans, and Deputy Director for Special Operations on the Joint Staff on Saturday as the attack on al-Baghdadi was launched\n\nShifting away from the airline hijackings and other mass-casualty attacks that came to define al-Qaeda, al-Baghdadi encouraged smaller-scale acts of violence that would be harder for law enforcement to prepare for and prevent.\n\nHe encouraged jihadists who could not travel to the caliphate to kill where they were using whatever weapon they had at their disposal, resulting in a series devastating attacks around the world.\n\nHis words inspired more than 140 terrorist attacks in 29 countries other than Iraq and Syria, resulting in the deaths of at least 2,043 people, CNN reports.\n\nAl-Baghdadi led ISIS for the last five years, presiding over its ascendancy as it cultivated a barbaric reputation for beheadings and horrific executions.\n\nThese recordings, often noted for their high production values, were distributed online along with the ISIS propaganda magazine Dabiq.\n\nHe remained among the few ISIS commanders still at large despite multiple claims in recent years about his death and even as his so-called caliphate dramatically shrank, with many supporters who joined the cause either imprisoned or jailed.\n\nA picture taken on October 27, 2019 shows a burnt vehicle at the site where a helicopter gunfire reportedly killed nine people near the northwestern Syrian village of Barisha in the province of Idlib near the border with Turkey\n\nTrump tweeted without explanation on Saturday: 'Something very big has just happened!'\n\nWith a $25million bounty on his head, al-Baghdadi had been far less visible in recent years, releasing only sporadic audio recordings, including one just last month in which he called on members of the extremist group to do all they could to free ISIS detainees and women held in jails and camps.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported an attack carried out by a squadron of eight helicopters accompanied by a warplane.\n\nThe attacks were on positions where ISIS operatives were believed to be hiding in the Barisha area north of Idlib city, after midnight on Saturday-Sunday.\n\nIt said the helicopters targeted ISIS positions with heavy strikes for about 120 minutes, during which jihadists targeted the helicopters with heavy weapons.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory documented the death of nine people as a result of the coalition helicopter attack, adding that the death toll is likely to rise due to the presence of a large number of wounded.\n\nThe strike came amid concerns that a recent American pullback from northeastern Syria could infuse new strength into the militant group, which had lost vast stretches of territory it had once controlled.\n\nThe purported audio was his first public statement since last April, when he appeared in a video for the first time in five years.\n\nIn 2014, he was a black-robed figure delivering a sermon from the pulpit of Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri, his only known public appearance.\n\nHe urged Muslims around the world to swear allegiance to the caliphate and obey him as its leader.\n\n'It is a burden to accept this responsibility to be in charge of you,' he said in the video.\n\nReports suggest that al-Baghdadi, the elusive militant who has been the subject of an international manhunt for years, had been killed in Idlib, Syria\n\n'I am not better than you or more virtuous than you. If you see me on the right path, help me. If you see me on the wrong path, advise me and halt me. And obey me as far as I obey God.'\n\nThe reported death of such a high-value US target comes amid a difficult political backdrop fro Trump, who has been frustrated heavy media focus on the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, which he calls an illegitimate witch hunt.\n\nHe has also faced withering criticism from both Republicans and Democrats alike for his US troop withdrawal from northeastern Syria, which permitted Turkey to attack America's Kurdish allies.", "description": "Between 50 and 70 members of the US Army Delta Force and Rangers flew in on six helicopters and conducted Sunday's overnight raid in Syria's Idlib province.", "authors": ["Megan Sheets For Dailymail.Com", "Rod Ardehali For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/13/20244720-0-image-a-8_1572183660465.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
