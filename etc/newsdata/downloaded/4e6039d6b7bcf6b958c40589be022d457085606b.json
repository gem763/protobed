He elaborated that transactions would not be possible without individuals willing to pay fiat money for Bitcoin (BTC), with blockchains being \u201cinherently inefficient, computationally costly systems,\u201d which only have value when using them for transactions.\n\nWeisenthal urged regulators and lawmakers to consider if it is really reasonable to pour money into the system and to make it easier for transactors to purchase things law enforcement authorities are against. Weisenthal continued:\n\n\u201cIf you're in the business of creating institutional onramps to crypto, you have to be cognizant of the risk that one day regulators wake up and ask: Wait, why did we provide a gateway to provide liquidity into a space, whose express purpose is to let people evade The Man?\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense & misinformation\u201d\n\nThe post turned into a heated discussion, with the participation of leading industry players. Anthony Pompliano, the founder of Morgan Creek Digital Assets, argued:\n\n\u201cThis is wildly inaccurate. You're claiming that non-censorship is the only value prop of Bitcoin. What about the non-seizure element? What about the disinflationary monetary supply? Or the sound money element? Or pseudonymity? Please stop writing nonsense & misinformation.\u201d\n\nCo-founder of Gemini crypto exchange, Cameron Winklevoss noted that the liquidity of gold markets enables \u201ctransactors,\u201d while it is a store of value and not a medium of exchange. Winklevoss further asked Weisenthal to reason his \u201ctortured argument\u201d to Bitcoin.\n\nWeisenthal parried, saying: \u201cThere's no question that liquidity in the gold market helps transactors. But it's extremely hard to use gold online in an censorship free manner, so that's not part of the selling point,\u201d to which Winklevoss questioned who exactly is transacting in gold.", "description": "Joe Weisenthal, editor of news for Bloomberg Digital, said that blockchains are essentially inefficient and that \u201cBitcoin is for making transactions The Man is...", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNzgxMWQ3MWY2ZmJkYWVkOGI1YmJhMDMzNGIzNjY3MmYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
