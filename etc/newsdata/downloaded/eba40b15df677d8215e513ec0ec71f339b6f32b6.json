We will have to live with those consequences.\"\n\nMorey and Silver have been lashed in the Chinese state-run press for their comments, while portraying the issue as a clash of values between China and the US.\n\nThe NBA's China sponsors have severed ties and Chinese netizens have called for boycotts.\n\nActions by local authorities and the NBA in the lead-up to the Chinese exhibition games, the second of which is slated for the southern city of Shenzhen on Saturday, have further fuelled concerns they will be cancelled.\n\nOn Wednesday, crews rappelled down glass-and-steel office buildings in Shanghai's financial district to peel off 13-storey promotional images of James and other players.\n\nMeanwhile, workers at the game venue pulled down NBA, Nets, Lakers, and corporate logos.\n\nThe NBA also has cancelled each one of a series of press or public activities in Shanghai in the lead-up to the game, with no explanation.\n\nAn event on Wednesday bringing the media together with players -- who would surely have faced sensitive questions over the controversy -- was called off just 10 minutes before start time.\n\nHong Kong has endured nearly four months of protests that were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions of criminal suspects to be tried by China's opaque courts.\n\nThey snowballed into a movement calling for more democratic freedoms, the biggest challenge to China's rule of Hong Kong since its handover from the British in 1997.\n\nChinese state media has repeatedly warned foreign firms against voicing support for the protesters, warning it could cost them access to China's market of 1.4 billion people.\n\nThe People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, on Wednesday slammed a transport app available on Apple's store that it alleged helped protesters identify police in Hong Kong.\n\nUS jewellery brand Tiffany and Hong Kong's flagship airline, Cathay Pacific, have also been heavily criticised in China.", "description": "The NBA's annual exhibition games in China hung in the balance on Thursday as pressure grew for them to be scrapped over a free speech row ignited by a...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/03/wire-19520886-1570673270-536_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
