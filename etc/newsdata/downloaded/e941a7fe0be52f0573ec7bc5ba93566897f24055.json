After requesting that I stay, they graciously obliged. The opportunities afforded this guy from small town Mississippi have been many. It\u2019s been an honor and a privilege to report the news each day to our loyal audience in context and with perspective, without fear or favor. I\u2019ve worked with the most talented, dedicated and focused professionals I know and I\u2019m proud to have anchored their work each day \u2014 I will deeply miss them.\n\nAccording to CNN, staffers inside Fox News were \u201copenly weeping\u201d over the news of Smith\u2019s departure and said some \u201cwere here and have stayed here solely\u201d due to the anchor.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s an exodus,\u201d the staffer continued, before adding, \u201cFox hasn\u2019t just lost Shep today.\u201d\n\nSmith joined Fox News in 1996 and covered major news stories for the network for over two decades. In a statement, Fox News president and executive editor, Jay Wallace, said Smith will leave his post as chief news anchor and managing editor of the outlet\u2019s breaking news unit.\n\nWallace said in a statement:\n\nShep is one of the premier newscasters of his generation and his extraordinary body of work is among the finest journalism in the industry. His integrity and outstanding reporting from the field helped put FOX News on the map and there is simply no better breaking news anchor who has the ability to transport a viewer to a place of conflict, tragedy, despair or elation through his masterful delivery. We are proud of the signature reporting and anchoring style he honed at FOX News, along with everything he accomplished here during his monumental 23-year tenure. While this day is especially difficult as his former producer, we respect his decision and are deeply grateful for his immense contributions to the entire network.\n\nSmith\u2019s departure comes as President Trump\u2019s relationship with Fox News continues to deteriorate. On Thursday, the president knocked Smith in a pair of tweets that were critical of a Fox News poll that found a record 51 percent of voters support his impeachment and removal from office.\n\nThe president tweeted:\n\nWhoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be.\n\nSpeaking to reporters ahead of his rally in Louisiana, President Trump questioned whether Smith\u2019s exit from Fox News was prompted by his ratings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming he\u2019s leaving because of bad ratings,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cI wish him well,\u201d he added.", "description": "Fox News Channel Shepard Smith's unexpected departure could be the start of an \"exodus\" at the news network, according to a staffer.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Shep-Smith-Signoff-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
