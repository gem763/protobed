Firstly through a lower discount rate and secondly because rates reduce the cost of their typically high debt levels.\n\nTheir big outperformance has pushed up valuations to levels that now present additional risk. REITs, for example, currently trade at an average 17 per cent premium to net tangible assets, being the independent values of underlying properties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImportantly, their appeal has been as much about risk as it is yield. Thus, retail REITs such as Scentre and Vicinity \u2013 that face online competition and other risks \u2013 have underperformed, and trade at significant discounts.\n\nLikewise, not all bond proxies are created equal. For example, the earnings of REITs and infrastructure stocks are unaffected by interest rates per se.\n\nIn contrast, utilities are essentially regulated towards a fair return on their equity investment which, in turn, will reflect prevailing rates of return.\n\nSpark Infrastructure owns electricity networks and will have new regulatory regimes from 2021 that will apply lower rates and hit earnings.\n\nDistributions are guided to fall, from 16 cents per share last year to an estimated 13 cents or even less from 2021. The stock nevertheless trades at a 30 per cent premium to the value of its assets on which regulators allow only a fair return.\n\nInvestors have also flocked to what are now called the \"expensive defensives\".\n\nFor very little growth, Woolworths trades on 26 times this year\u2019s earnings, ASX Ltd on 32 times, Tabcorp on 25 times, and even Coca-Cola Amatil on 21 times. All are well above market averages.\n\nInvestors are worried today about recessions and corrections. However, since the GFC, bad economic news has been good news for investors as it has usually brought with it monetary stimulus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEquities have benefited because the uplift to valuations from lower rates overwhelmed the impact of weaker earnings, which those lower rates imply.\n\nUsually, risk and returns are correlated. In this market, however, the lowest risk assets have delivered among the highest returns. The danger is that this self-corrects at some point.\n\nToday, an important risk many investors are not worried about is that we get good news.\n\nThe clear consensus is for rates to stay lower for longer, a view shared by Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Philip Lowe in his latest policy decision announcement.\n\nBut interest rates are notoriously unpredictable, even for the RBA. The consensus often gets it wrong and can change quickly. Only this time last year, the outright consensus was for \"normalisation\" upwards of interest rates.\n\nWith many investors complaining about the uncertainty in world markets, assuming the worst comes with its own risks. It\u2019s possible a trade deal gets done, RBA stimulus takes effect, economic confidence improves, or ultimately, interest rates go up.\n\nWe might then find that good news will be bad news for markets.\n\nJulian Beaumont is the investment director of Bennelong Australian Equity Partners.", "description": "Assuming the worst comes with its own risk for equity investors, writes Julian Beaumont at Bennelong Australian Equity Partners.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2929%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_24/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a1898ec549c2aeb40041623ac5bd4693e779daf8", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
