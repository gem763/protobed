If your relatives do, genetic matches to you can be identified.\"\n\nMr Waters recently introduced his son to the two children he has raised, describing it as a \"life enriching\" and \"immensely positive\" experience.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has changed the advice it gives to clinics and is asking them to highlight the popularity of DNA websites\n\nHe has put his details on the donor-conceived register so that his other children could find him.\n\n\"It is time to tell our kids where they come from, before they find out themselves, and hate us for it. The later we leave it, the more distress and anger it causes,\" he said.\n\nThe HFEA said it had seen a 200% rise in the number of people requesting information on their biological parents since 2010.\n\nIt has made it possible for donors to voluntarily remove their anonymity from its register and has changed the advice it provides to clinics, asking them to highlight the popularity of these websites.\n\nSally Cheshire, chair of the HFEA, said: \"The recent rise in the number of people using DNA testing websites to trace their ancestry means that more people may inadvertently find out that they were conceived through a donor.\n\n\"We are talking to these companies about making sure they provide clear information on their websites about the potential risks of using their DNA matching services and that they signpost their users to appropriate support.\"\n\nThree million people had used home DNA kits by 2016, but the total now was thought to be about 30 million. Around 100 million people will have used one by 2021, according to the fertility charity the Progress Educational Trust, which has called for support systems to be set up for anyone affected by the rise in home DNA testing.\n\nSarah Norcross, director of the charity, said: \"This is a wake-up call for everyone involved in donor conception; there can be no more donor secrets. What is needed now is appropriate and adequate support for all affected.\"\n\nBBC Radio 5 Live is hosting a special Fertility Day on Tuesday 29 October in partnership with BBC Radio 2, and has created a website with more information.", "description": "A man who has fathered up to 110 children says it is impossible for sperm donors to be anonymous.", "authors": ["Charlie Jones", "Amara Sophia Elahi", "Bbc Radio Live"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/46C1/production/_109431181_76-1-1-2-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
