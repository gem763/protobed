They lined street that snakes around the plant that builds the popular Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups.\n\nHorns honked as union members from throughout the region arrived in Flint, the birthplace of GM and a key spot in UAW history. In fact, cars blocked Van Slyke completely as the now-striking workers left the plant.", "description": "", "authors": ["Freep.Com Story Money Cars Uaw-Strike-Gm-Autoworker-Contract-Talks"], "top_image": ""}
