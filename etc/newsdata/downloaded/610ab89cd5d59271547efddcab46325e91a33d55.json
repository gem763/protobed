(NASDAQ:UNB) Should Consider This, First", "language": "en", "text": "Is Union Bankshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:UNB) a good dividend stock? How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nA high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Union Bankshares. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nNasdaqGM:UNB Historical Dividend Yield, October 3rd 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 78% of Union Bankshares's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. It's paying out most of its earnings, which limits the amount that can be reinvested in the business. This may indicate limited need for further capital within the business, or highlight a commitment to paying a dividend.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Union Bankshares's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. Union Bankshares has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. The dividend has been cut by more than 20% on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$1.12 in 2009, compared to US$1.24 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 1.0% per year over this time. The growth in dividends has not been linear, but the CAGR is a decent approximation of the rate of change over this time frame.\n\nModest growth in the dividend is good to see, but we think this is offset by historical cuts to the payments. It is hard to live on a dividend income if the company's earnings are not consistent.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Why take the risk of a dividend getting cut, unless there's a good chance of bigger dividends in future? Union Bankshares's earnings per share have been essentially flat over the past five years. Over the long term, steady earnings per share is a risk as the value of the dividends can be reduced by inflation.\n\nConclusion\n\nDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. First, we think Union Bankshares has an acceptable payout ratio. Earnings per share are down, and Union Bankshares's dividend has been cut at least once in the past, which is disappointing. To conclude, we've spotted a couple of potential concerns with Union Bankshares that may make it less than ideal candidate for dividend investors.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Is Union Bankshares, Inc.
