Democrats have accused Trump of an implied quid pro quo, using U.S. military aid as leverage, though the White House has vigorously denied that the aid was linked to Trump's request for the investigation.\n\nDEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE\n\nThe impeachment push dominated headlines last week after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the launch of an official investigation -- and a sudden shift in polls showing more Americans support the impeachment has host Greg Gutfeld pointing fingers.\n\n\"I have a theory,\" he said, \"that this entire story is generated by a pool of maybe 500 to a thousand people...like it's a kiddie pool of influencers that doesn't have an impact on America until it is able to generate enough steam and heat,\" Gutfeld said.\n\nPOMPEO HITS BACK AT HOUSE DEMS IN DEPOSITION STANDOFF, CONFIRMS HE WAS ON UKRAINE CALL\n\n\"So,\" he continued, \"like last week the polls said...America doesn't care about impeachment. Now the polls are changing and the media's going look...'the polls are changing' -- after the media have been pushing for impeachment nonstop for one week. So it seems like there's this tiny knot of people there that are actually controlling the narrative of a nation,\" said Gutfeld.\n\nReiterating Gutfeld's point, Strassel took aim at The New York Times for reporting over the weekend that President Trump had privately pressed Australia's leader to help Attorney General William Barr at the outset of the Russia investigation; but a letter later obtained by Fox News showed that Australia had in-fact reached out to Trump to offer assistance.\n\nAUSTRALIA PROACTIVELY OFFERED TO HELP TRUMP ADMIN, DESPITE NYT CLAIMS THEY WERE PRESSURED\n\nStrassel continued to criticize the media's coverage of the impeachment and Trump-related developments, but expressed the \"eminent faith\" she has \"in the American people to see through some of the misinformation and misdirection that comes from a lot of the media.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"The media hasn't helped itself over the past two years and the average American doesn't trust anything that they put out anymore,\" she said.\n\n\"So I have faith that they'll see through some of the baloney.\"\n\nFor Strassel's full remarks, join Fox Nation and watch the full episode of \"One Smart Person & Greg Gutfeld\" today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only for Fox Nation subscribers.
