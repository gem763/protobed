South Korea said North Korea fired \u201cshort-range projectiles\u201d into its eastern seas that flew about 330 kilometers (200 miles).\n\nNorth Korea Tests More Weapons After Floating Fresh U.S. Talks\n\n\u201cThe supreme leader said that the weapon system of super-large multiple rocket launcher has been finally verified in terms of combat operation,\u201d KCNA said. It also released photos of the test that showed a smiling Kim, who has been on hand for almost all of his state\u2019s series of missiles and weapon tests that started in May, standing by a launcher.\n\nThe test appeared to be of 600 mm caliber multiple-launch rocket system that North Korea first introduced last month, said Ankit Panda, an adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists. Panda adding that the trajectory varied considerably from the previous test, suggesting North Korea was exploring what this system was capable of.\n\n\u201cThe North Korean statement hints at further testing, including possibly a so-called \u2018ripple\u2019 fire test, where they look to rapidly fire all of the four missiles this system can carry in one salvo,\u201d said Panda, who covers nuclear and conventional force developments in Asia\n\nSanctions Busting\n\nThe Tuesday test came shortly after a top North Korean diplomat, Choe Son Hui, issued a statement saying the country would be willing to hold talks \u201cat the time and place to be agreed late in September.\u201d North Korea often ratchets up military tensions ahead of negotiations intended to end its nuclear ambitions.\n\nNorth Korea was due to come into focus when UN General Assembly meeting starts next week in New York after a UN Security Panel report said Pyongyang was violating sanctions to help fund its weapons program. South Korea\u2019s top nuclear envoy was due to go to China, the main benefactor of Kim\u2019s government, this week to discuss developments on the divided peninsula.\n\nThe North Korean statement cited recent comments by U.S. officials expressing a desire for negotiations and made no mention of any new concessions. The remarks, which follow a speech Friday by lead U.S. negotiator Stephen Biegun, represented some of the regime\u2019s most positive remarks about talks since President Donald Trump\u2019s June 30 meeting with Kim.\n\nBiegun\u2019s remarks last week highlighted that almost no progress has been made toward an agreement on North Korea\u2019s nuclear program despite three meetings between Trump and Kim. After their latest meeting, the U.S. said Kim had agreed to begin detailed negotiations by mid-July.\n\nKim, who has suspended testing of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles while engaged in talks with the U.S., has given Trump until the end of the year to ease up on sanctions choking his state\u2019s anemic economy. At the same time, he has threatened to take a \u201cnew path,\u201d if the U.S. doesn\u2019t change course.\n\nMost of North Korea\u2019s recent tests since May have been of a new missile known as the KN-23, which weapons experts said can deliver a nuclear warhead to all of South Korea and parts of Japan and is designed to evade U.S. missile interceptors. There was no indication so far that the missile was a part of the Tuesday test.\n\n(Adds details on North Korea weapons test.)\n\n--With assistance from Jihye Lee.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jon Herskovitz in Tokyo at jherskovitz@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, Peter Pae\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the test of a \u201csuper-large multiple rocket launcher\u201d the state\u2019s media said of the military display that came shortly after Pyongyang announced it was willing to restart nuclear talks with the U.S.Kim, military leaders and top officials \u201cin the field", "authors": ["Jon Herskovitz"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VYlIY56PMKoiBP4H7OqNnw--~B/aD0xMzY2O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/07eaa42b5db76546100a772ccb630614", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
