However, despite growing its mDAU, Twitter's Q3 ad revenue growth decelerated to 8% YoY, down from 29% YoY growth in Q3 2018, due in part to product bugs that impacted its ad targeting capabilities. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nTwitter's product improvements in the quarter have likely helped the company to improve active usage and deepen engagement on the platform. CEO Jack Dorsey attributed mDAU growth to product improvements that made the site easier to navigate and content more personalized to individual users.\n\nTo that end, Twitter began rolling out design changes and features meant to \"make it easier for people to find what they are looking for.\" For example, Twitter added the ability for people to create or subscribe to customized lists based on their interests, and pin up to five of those lists alongside their Home timeline on iOS. Better personalization can improve relevance of the content that users are shown and drive deeper engagement on the platform.\n\nTwitter's platform improvements may largely be resonating among a relatively small group of highly active users. A small percentage of highly active users disproportionately account for the vast majority of sharing on the platform: The top 10% most active US Twitter users are responsible for 80% of all tweets created in the country, per Pew Research.\n\nTwitter's top 10% most productive tweeters posted a median of 138 tweets per month, compared with just two tweets for the bottom 90% of tweeters. Further, this top 10% is also more likely to visit the site more than once per day: Among that group, 81% said that they use Twitter once a day or more, while less than half (47%) of the bottom 90% of active users said the same, per Pew.\n\nAs Twitter improves the user experience and health of conversation on the platform, we expect it will expand its base of profitable users. Twitter's efforts to improve relevance and ease of use could convert more casual users \u2014 or even nonusers \u2014 into highly active and engaged mDAU, which could spur greater advertiser demand. As Twitter adds mDAU, Twitter will boost the profitability of its overall user base. As these features become more seamlessly integrated into the platform, we think ad growth is likely to reaccelerate: Twitter noted in the report that YoY ad revenue growth rebounded to double-digits globally in the month of September.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
