Buttigieg, the first major gay presidential candidate, has raised a total of more than $51 million since the beginning of the year.\n\n\u201cPeople continue to be drawn to Pete and his vision of bridging our divides and to his bold plans to move our country forward, and our campaign has grown exponentially faster than any other candidate in the 2020 field,\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s campaign manager, Mike Schmuhl, said in a statement.\n\nSchmuhl added that about 182,000 new donors contributed to the campaign in the three months that ended Sept. 30, bringing the total number of unique donors to more than 580,000.\n\nI am profoundly grateful to every single person who has pitched in to power our campaign. Together, we\u2019re building a movement that\u2019s big enough, and hopeful enough, to do things differently and win. Thank you. https://t.co/zLjVuOENN4 \u2014 Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) October 1, 2019\n\nButtigieg\u2019s quarterly fundraising efforts fell short of the staggering $24.9 million that his campaign raised in the second quarter. His Q2 numbers eclipsed those of all his Democratic rivals, including the $19 million raised by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and the $21.5 million amassed by former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nButtigieg won\u2019t be boasting the top fundraising figures in the third quarter.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) raised $25.3 million in Q3, the senator\u2019s campaign said on Tuesday. All 2020 presidential candidates will need to report their fundraising totals to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15.\n\n\u201cBernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grassroots donations \u2013 both in the primary and in the general,\u201d Faiz Shakir, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, said in a statement. \u201cMedia elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times praised Buttigieg in July as being the Democratic candidate who had most successfully \u201cmarried traditional high-dollar fund-raising with online small donations,\u201d wooing a diverse array of contributors who included college students to tech executives in Silicon Valley, as well as military veterans and members of the LGBTQ community.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a badass operation,\u201d Rufus Gifford, finance director for former President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection campaign, told the Times of Buttigieg\u2019s campaign.\n\nButtigieg rakes in around $100,000 every time he appears at a fundraising event, Politico reported.\n\nWe decided early on you wouldn\u2019t hear too much from me about our fundraising\u2014only when it matters. It matters right now. How much we raise before tonight's deadline will determine where we go and what we do in the coming months.

Cory Booker and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro.\n\nBooker warned last month that he was considering dropping out of the race if his team didn\u2019t raise at least $1.7 million for the quarter.
