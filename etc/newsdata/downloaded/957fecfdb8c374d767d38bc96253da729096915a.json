She's fat and ugly.\"\n\nBar-Mitzvahs\n\nMr Gascoigne told the jury he previously had trouble with his weight and \"automatically\" went to sit next to the woman to reassure her.\n\nHe said he told her: \"You're not fat and ugly, you're beautiful.\"\n\nA court usher handed him a tissue as he became emotional while giving evidence in the dock.\n\nJurors were handed a file of photos showing Mr Gascoigne kissing and being kissed by famous footballers and fans.\n\nA photo of him kissing Diana, Princess of Wales, was also included.\n\nHis defence barrister, Michelle Heeley QC, read out character references from former professional boxer Ricky Hatton MBE and football agent Mel Stein.\n\nIn his reference, Mr Stein said the former player was a \"tactile\" and friendly person.\n\nHe said he had invited Mr Gascoigne to several Bar-Mitzvahs, adding that on one occasion: \"He greeted a rabbi's wife by hugging and kissing her. He apologised when he realised what he had done.\"\n\n'Kissed a fat lass'\n\nEarlier, jurors heard how the Mr Gascoigne was in an \"intoxicated, drunken state\" when he was arrested.\n\nBritish Transport Police PC Robert Moody told the court Mr Gascoigne was drinking beer in a hotel lobby when he arrived to arrest him.\n\nPC Moody said he had spoken to Mr Gascoigne prior to travelling to the hotel, telling jurors Gascoigne had said: \"I know what it's about, I kissed a fat lass.\"\n\nThe court has heard Mr Gascoigne \"forcefully and sloppily\" kissed the woman on the lips while drunk on the train and that she was left \"shocked and upset\".\n\nIn a police interview he said he had undergone an operation which made him sick if he drank spirits and that \"thousands\" of strangers had come up to him and kissed him over the years.\n\nHe said he had only consumed \"three or four cans\" prior to the incident because spirits made him \"spew up\" following the operation.\n\nDuring the police interview he told officers: \"I can have beer, I won't spew up. Any shorts, I spew up immediately,\" adding: \"Before the operation I could drink gin no problem.\"\n\nHe said any impression he had been slurring his words was because he did not have a bridge of teeth in. He took the teeth out during his evidence and demonstrated how different his voice sounded without them in.\n\nMr Gascoigne, who now lives in Leicester, denies a charge of sexual assault by touching.\n\nThe trial continues.\n\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
