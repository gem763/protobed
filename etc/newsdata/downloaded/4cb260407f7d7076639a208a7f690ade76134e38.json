This is the new me,\"' she said after giving birth to her daughters.\n\n'My children obliterated my abdominal wall. Good Night. That's a wrap. It's never going to come back. What do you need it for? You're married. SPANX exist.

This is the new me,\"' she said after giving birth to her daughters\n\nThrowback: Kristen revealed she thought she'd never get her abs back from when she was in her 20s (pictured with Russell Brand in Forgetting Sarah Marshall in 2008 when she was 28)\n\nLoves it: 'I'm not in love with working out and I've never really found a class that I love like this.

Something about this class gets me,' she said.\n\n'I started doing this, and I was like, \"I\u2019m still roughly the same size but now it\u2019s just all muscle\" ... I feel so much stronger, and it's a physical feeling, but it's also a mental feeling. It's about the muscle value in my body.'\n\nKristen went on to say that she's never felt 'physically strong' until now since going to the classes.\n\nMotivated: Kristen told the publication that she goes to the class usually three times a week, despite it being 30 minutes away, without traffic, from her Los Feliz home\n\nBalance: 'I have to eat carbs because I have to memorize 11 pages of dialogue, and I can\u2019t do that eating spinach and chicken,' she joked\n\nAs for her diet, the star revealed she was vegetarian and still enjoyed her dose of carbs.\n\n'I have to eat carbs because I have to memorize 11 pages of dialogue, and I can\u2019t do that eating spinach and chicken,' she joked.\n\nA fan of au gratin potatoes she said she was never restrictive but enjoyed a moderate portion size.\n\nOne year on: 'I started doing this, and I was like, \"I\u2019m still roughly the same size but now it\u2019s just all muscle\" ...

It's about the muscle value in my body' (L: Emmys 2018, R: Emmys 2019)\n\nKristen spoke about her dietary choices back in 2017 to the LA Times, explaining why she stopped being vegan.\n\n'I was vegan and am now vegetarian. I\u2019m all about eating clean and ethically, but I also believe that it\u2019s important to listen to your body,' she said at the time.\n\n'Some people\u2019s bodies tell them to eat meat. There\u2019s a better way to do it because factory farming is a nightmare. I give my children meat; the chicken they get has been raised in, basically, a spa. They get all but manicures.'", "description": "Kristen Bell showcased her incredible rock hard abs on Wednesday when she graced the cover of Women's Health November issue.", "authors": ["Annita Katee For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/17/19500308-0-image-a-17_1570637161146.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
