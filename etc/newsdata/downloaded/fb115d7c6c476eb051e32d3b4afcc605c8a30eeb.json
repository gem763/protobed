Shovels in hand and guns slung across their backs in case of a sniper attack, they are part of their government's stepped-up efforts to slash cocaine production under pressure from Washington.\n\nAlongside them, paid civilians in blue uniforms also dug on the hillside in the northwestern Antioquia province. Under protection from the army and police, they must uproot plants by hand because Colombia's top court banned aerial spraying with herbicides four years ago due to public health concerns in the world's largest cocaine producer.\n\nThe civilian workers earn about $530 per month, roughly double minimum wage, for the dangerous work. In addition to possible sniper attacks by drug gangs, antipersonnel mines buried among the coca bushes have killed or injured several people this year.\n\nEvery day, the team of around 50 soldiers and 20 civilians destroys between two and three hectares of coca plants, a tiny fraction of the more than 200,000 hectares of plantations in Colombia last year, according to U.S. government figures.\n\n\"I came to work because I need to survive: I need the money for my family,\" said Jorge Eliecer Ortiz, 47, a civilian. \"If it were up to me, I would not do this because this is a very dangerous job, but you take risks to support your family.\"", "description": "Colombian soldiers with shovels in hand and guns slung across backs are part of their government's increased efforts to slash cocaine production.", "authors": ["Luis Jaime Acosta"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7fcb9c2e22af165c1d0b66-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
