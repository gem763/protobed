He was beheaded by ISIS terrorists in August of 2014, the first American citizen to be killed by the Islamic State.\n\nA senior U.S. defense official told Fox News on Wednesday that two British militants believed to be part of an Islamic State group that beheaded hostages have been moved out of a detention center in Syria and taken into American custody.\n\nKILMEADE ON TRUMP PULLING US TROOPS OUT OF SYRIA: WE'LL BE 'RIGHT BACK THERE' TO FIGHT ISIS\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to remember that they [British Jihadist] are a small portion of the 10,000 ISIS fighters that have been captured and held along that border,\u201d Foley said.\n\nISIS fighters and other terrorists comprising more than 10,000 Islamic militants jailed in northeast Syria could launch a mass prison break, Syrian Kurdish fighters warned Monday.\n\n\u201cSo for them [captured ISIS militants] to go unguarded and be able to escape into our Western world creates a serious international security risk,\" she said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPresident Trump said earlier Wednesday that the U.S. had moved some of the \"most dangerous\" Islamic State prisoners from Syria amid fears that they may escape as Turkey invades Syria\u2019s northeast region.\n\nSo far these are the only two ISIS-connected individuals removed from Syria by the U.S. in case security breaks down as a result of the Turkish action, but officials said a number of others could be moved if needed. Thousands of other Islamic State group detainees remain in custody under control of the Kurds.\n\nFoley said she \"hates to see us abdicating our role as an international leader against the human right atrocities\" in Syria, amid reports of Turkish forces attacking civilian areas.\n\nFox News\u2019 Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.", "description": "The mother of an American journalist who was murdered in Syria\u00a0voiced concerns on Friday over U.S. troops being withdrawn from northeast Syria\u00a0by President Trump.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-11-at-12.49.43-PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
