However, given that Facebook has a commenting section it spiralled rather quickly to which we weren\u2019t expecting.\n\n\"We were merely asking for a yes or a no; it was finalised as a firm no (take it off the menu) so respecting this, we have removed the dish.\n\n\"We have taken into account that we have offended some of you, so for that, we apologise.\n\n\"On the other hand, we are saddened by the fact that not all opinions offered were delivered with dignity and consideration. It is never acceptable to make threats. Nor are the recommendations just as we have not even opened yet!\n\n\"The comments and private messages were extreme to say the least, considering that in our poll we shared no opinion about the matter. We were trying to connect with the community and some felt the need to punish us for our earnestness.\"\n\nIt finished by stating they hope to close the chapter on the episode and to welcome some friendly faces in the restaurant.\n\nMaximillian has said he hopes the pub will be fully open in the first week of November.", "description": "Barnetts at the Old Bank House criticised people who left 'extreme' comments and made threats when they posted about the menu on social media", "authors": ["Luke Matthews"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20666642.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PRI_90281801.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
