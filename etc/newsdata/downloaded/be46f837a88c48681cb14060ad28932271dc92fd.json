Subscribe to the newsletter here .\n\nWhen I said that I would have more to share from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s employee Q&A sessions for you in the newsletter this week, I didn\u2019t think it would go like this.\n\nThree days after we published leaked audio from a pair of July meetings inside Facebook, Zuckerberg decided to live-stream Thursday\u2019s all-hands meeting to show the rest of the world what they really look like. And that meant including everything \u2014 the \u201cfix of the week,\u201d in which someone describes resolving some technical issue in the product; a \u201cFaceversary\u201d story, in which someone celebrating 10 years at the company gets to tell a story on stage; and the closing message, in which a slick marketing video highlights an inspirational person who is using Facebook products to positive ends.\n\nIn between, there were questions and answers from real, live Facebook employees, who mostly seemed unembarrassed to be asking their questions in front of a global audience. (Extra points to the WhatsApp engineer who managed to ask two questions during the session, the latter of which \u2014 \u201cwhat do you think of Bernie Sanders\u2019 comment that billionaires shouldn\u2019t exist?\u201d \u2014 was maybe the most provocative of the day. (Zuckerberg\u2019s answer, which was basically \u201cno,\u201d will also surely spur a round of thought pieces around the web in coming days.)\n\nThe context for all this, as Zuckerberg explained in preliminary remarks at the top of the meeting, was a sense that our leak had inadvertently exposed the fact that he tends to perform better in front of employees than he does with journalists. \u201cI do interviews, and I\u2019m just, like, the worst in interviews,\u201d he said, as employees laughed. \u201cI\u2019m robotic, and I don\u2019t think in sound bites.\u201d He joked about the kinds of questions he gets: \u201cWhere do you go to plug yourself in at night to recharge?\u201d\n\nLive from our weekly internal Q&A Live from our weekly internal Q&A. Posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday, October 3, 2019\n\nZuckerberg said the company had been surprised by the leak, as it has been the first time in company history that an all-hands meeting had been recorded and shared with the media. (\u201cA blog,\u201d as Zuckerberg called The Verge!)\n\n\u201cI think a lot of us internally were pretty shocked by that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to be able to continue doing these, and have them be open. But then we had the second reaction which is, hey, you know, all the content that\u2019s in there \u2014 we stand behind. And maybe I said that in a little bit more unfiltered of a way than I would say it externally, but fundamentally we believe everything we said that was in there.\u201d\n\nPeople have told him for years that public perception of the company would improve if more members of the public could see him the way he is in Q&As, he said. And so he decided to broadcast this week\u2019s event. \u201cThis was an interesting forcing function,\u201d Zuckerberg said of my work, which is definitely going on my Facebook Dating bio.\n\n\u201cI do such a bad job at interviews, it\u2019s like, what do we have to lose?\u201d Zuckerberg said, and the audience laughed and applauded.\n\nZuckerberg talked about the company\u2019s commitment to encryption in light of the news today that the US attorney general wanted the company to delay its plans to roll out end-to-end encryption across its messaging apps. He lamented a ruling in the European Union\u2019s top court that could force Facebook to take down content that is found to be libelous outside the country where the ruling is made, in a blow to free speech.\n\n\u201cI do such a bad job at interviews, it\u2019s like, what do we have to lose?\u201d\n\nTo the employee who asked whether Facebook would ever lose relevance, Zuckerberg explained that most of the biggest companies in any given decade are no longer in the top 10 biggest companies by the next decade. The odds are against Facebook, he said, though the company is working hard to overcome them.\n\nTo the employee who asked how Facebook Dating was going, he explained that 80 percent of people who used it in test countries came back every week, giving the company the confidence to launch it in the United States several weeks ago. It continues to grow, Zuckerberg said, but he wouldn\u2019t say how fast, citing the team\u2019s wishes.\n\nThere was the should-billionaires-exist question, which Zuckerberg answered fairly directly by saying no. But he defended the system that lets some private individuals grow wealthy enough to invest in scientific research, saying that the alternative \u2014 100 percent public funding \u2014 had problems of its own.\n\nTo the employee who worried about this weekend\u2019s New York Times report about the use of social platforms to spread child exploitation imagery, he explained the steps that the company has taken to address the problem so far and committed to doing much more before Facebook attempts to encrypt Messenger messages by default.\n\nThen someone asked him about Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who had gone after Zuckerberg after reading the remarks he made in our earlier report. How would Zuckerberg remain \u201cimpartial\u201d given the dust-up? \u201cGod,\u201d he said, laughing to himself. \u201cTry not to antagonize her further.\u201d\n\nI found his response, which was quite long, somewhat hard to follow. There were two parts to it: one about \u201cprinciples,\u201d in which he said that he cared much more about giving people a voice regardless of an individual policy outcome. So by that logic, he wouldn\u2019t (say) artificially down-rank Warren\u2019s traffic if she posted about breaking up Facebook, because he prizes democratic debate above all. The second point was about \u201cempathy\u201d \u2014 realizing that, because of Facebook\u2019s vast size and power, people heavily depend on what happens there, and often assume that it is biased.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real moment for at least understanding where a lot of the people are coming from,\u201d He said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the primary thing. We want everyone to have a voice. This is a good learning moment to remember that.\u201d\n\nThen someone asked him if Facebook would ever hold a hackathon for climate change and he said that it already had.\n\nOn the whole, I\u2019d say the surprise broadcast succeeded on the terms Zuckerberg set for him. It did, in fact, show him looser and in a better mood than he usually appears when being interviewed by the likes of me. He moved confidently around the room. His jokes landed.\n\nSome people assumed the event was aggressively staged, but Zuckerberg said they had only informed most people that it would be public 15 minutes before the broadcast aired, and having listened to both the private recording and watched the public broadcast I was struck by how little difference there was between them. There was an honesty to the event that resonated. \u201cI\u2019m not making any promises to do this again in the future,\u201d Zuckerberg said, but everything went well enough that I could easily see him doing just that.\n\nWhen the afternoon\u2019s questions all ended, the slick marketing video that had been queued up began to play. The first image it showed on the screen was a small group of Facebook users splashing around in the water. It turned out they were swimming with sharks.\n\nThe Ratio\n\nToday in news that could affect public perception of tech platforms.\n\nTrending up: Facebook\u2019s counterterrorism teams have shifted to fight white supremacist activity more directly. (David Uberti / Vice)\n\nTrending sideways: TikTok banned political advertising, reflecting a distaste for politics among its two core constituencies: teenagers and the Chinese government.\n\nTrending down: Apple banned an app used by Hong Kong protesters to track police activity and find nearby demonstrations. (Kieren McCarthy / The Register)\n\nGoverning\n\n\u2b50 Attorney General William Barr asked Facebook to delay plans to roll out encrypted messaging across its family of apps, citing safety concerns. The letter was signed by Barr\u2019s counterparts in the United Kingdom and Australia, and it could set up a major battle over encryption. The new move is to focus on child safety rather than terrorism as a pretext. Ryan Mac and Joe Bernstein report:\n\n\u201cSecurity enhancements to the virtual world should not make us more vulnerable in the physical world,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cCompanies should not deliberately design their systems to preclude any form of access to content, even for preventing or investigating the most serious crimes.\u201d The letter calls on Facebook to prioritize public safety in designing its encryption by enabling law enforcement to gain access to illegal content in a manageable format and by consulting with governments ahead of time to ensure the changes will allow this access. While the letter acknowledges that Facebook \u2014 which owns Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram \u2014 captures 99% of child exploitation and terrorism-related content through its own systems, it also notes that \u201cmere numbers cannot capture the significance of the harm to children.\u201d\n\n\u2b50 Facebook can be forced to take down libelous comments internationally, according to a new ruling from the EU\u2019s top court. The decision came after an Austrian politician requested an order that would force Facebook to remove comments that harmed her reputation. Here\u2019s Makena Kelly at The Verge:\n\nIn its ruling, the European Court of Justice affirms that companies like Facebook and Twitter are not liable for the content posted on their platforms, but that exemption does not prohibit the courts from ordering the companies to take down illegal content. Late last month, this same court ruled that Google doesn\u2019t need to remove links taken down from \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d requests worldwide. But illegal content can be limited internationally, according to Thursday\u2019s Facebook ruling. Facebook opposed the ruling. \u201cThis judgment raises critical questions around freedom of expression and the role that internet companies should play in monitoring, interpreting and removing speech that might be illegal in any particular country,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris wrote a letter to CEO Jack Dorsey asking him to ban Trump from Twitter. Harris cited the president\u2019s recent Twitter rants against the whistleblower at the center of the impeachment case; New York\u2019s tech team discussed the merits of her argument. (Brian Feldman, Benjamin Hart and Max Read / Intelligencer)\n\nSilicon Valley appears to be warming to Elizabeth Warren, despite her largely anti-industry sentiment. Warren still intends to break up big tech companies \u2014 but she is accepting small checks from tech executives. (Theodore Schleifer / Recode)\n\nSnap and Twitter have been so successful this year that it could threaten the government\u2019s antitrust case against Facebook. Both have reported strong revenue growth, sending their stock prices soaring. (Tom Dotan / The Information)\n\nFacebook reached a settlement with a New Zealand app developer peddling fake likes on Instagram. The developer could pay as much as $9.4 million, a win for Facebook\u2019s recently invigorated efforts to fight fraudulent third-party developers. (Tony Romm / The Washington Post)\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security announced a controversial plan to start DNA testing immigrants and entering their information into a criminal database. The plan could harm people booked at immigration detention centers around the country. (Zoe Schiffer / The Verge)\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement is embracing big data in its efforts to track down people who\u2019ve entered the country illegally. Increasingly, the agency is developing intelligence based on their targets\u2019 social media accounts. (McKenzie Funk / The New York Times)\n\nHong Kong has banned face masks at public gatherings, enacting an emergency ordinance that hadn\u2019t been used in half a century. The move comes after a protester was shot in the latest round of pro-democracy protests on Tuesday. (Iain Marlow / Bloomberg)\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron is rolling out a new digital identity program that uses facial recognition technology. But the country\u2019s data regulator says the program breaches the European rule of consent, and a privacy group is challenging it in court. (Helene Fouquet / Bloomberg)\n\nIndustry\n\n\u2b50 Instagram launched Threads, a standalone messaging app for close friends. It\u2019s a companion app for Instagram that lets you quickly share messages, photos, and videos with your \u201cclose friends\u201d list. It\u2019s also encourages you to continuously share your location and other intimate details with friends, I wrote here for The Verge:\n\nOr \u2014 and here\u2019s what Instagram actually wants \u2014 you can opt in to \u201cauto status,\u201d which will refresh your status throughout the day as you move about your life. It will learn when you\u2019re at home and at work, for example, and update accordingly. Instagram says it won\u2019t store your exact location, but rather uses the information to create \u201ccontext.\u201d If you\u2019re at home, you might want to go out, the thinking goes; if you\u2019re at work, you\u2019re probably stuck for a while.\n\nIf you do that, Threads will collect your location, movement, battery level, and network connection in order to determine what status to share.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of data to give up, and after years of Facebook scandals related to data privacy issues, some users might find that the trade-off isn\u2019t worth it. But it\u2019s also worth noting that other messaging apps, most notably Snapchat, essentially ask for the same permissions. Snapchat won\u2019t generate an automatic status for you throughout the day, but it will put you on a map with all your friends if you let it. Ultimately, whether you opt in to features like these depends heavily on whether your social circle does.\n\n\u201cA study of 1,769 U.S. undergrads found that those who got off Facebook for a week consumed less news, experienced greater wellbeing\u2026and, uh, valued Facebook 20 percent more highly, in monetary terms, than they had before they took their break.\u201d (Laura Hazard Owen / Nieman Lab)\n\nSaudi Arabia is bankrolling luxury vacations for Instagram and YouTube influencers in an effort to repair its tattered reputation. The country is trying to build a tourism industry from scratch, but that\u2019s hard when you\u2019re best known for human rights violations and murdering a dissident journalist. (Bill Bostock / Insider)\n\nGoogle pledged to provide 250,000 job training opportunities to American workers over the next five years as part of a White House initiative to expand educational programs. CEO Sundar Pichai made the announcement alongside Ivanka Trump in Texas. (Lauren Feiner / CNBC)\n\nYouTube is experimenting with a \u201cself-certification\u201d program that lets creators report their own videos if the content isn\u2019t advertiser-friendly. The goal is to give creators more control over the video-monetization process. (Richard Nieva / CNET)\n\nTikTok exists outside of time \u2014 videos don\u2019t have timestamps, allowing them to go viral weeks or even months after they were posted. The app also covers the time displayed on your phone, meaning you can quickly lose track of the hours you\u2019ve spent scrolling, the author notes. (Louise Matsakis / Wired)\n\nOculus co-founder Palmer Luckey created an autonomous battering-ram drone. Made by Luckey\u2019s defense company, Anduril, the Interceptor is designed to destroy other drones mid-flight.

Now, underneath Trump\u2019s all-capped instruction to \u201cLOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH!\u201d a short message explains that the video has been removed due to a claim from the song\u2019s copyright holder.\n\nTime to say it, Donald Trump ... goodbye.\n\nTalk to us\n\nSend us tips, comments, questions, and your Facebook outage stories: casey@theverge.com and zoe@theverge.com.", "description": "In a public Q&A with employees, the CEO speaks up for the value of public debate.
