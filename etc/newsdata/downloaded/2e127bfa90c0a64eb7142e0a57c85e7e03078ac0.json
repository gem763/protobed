We\u2019re doing great.\u201d In reality, of course, the president isn\u2019t actually withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria, despite his claims to the contrary, and he\u2019s deploying additional U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia.\n\nOn the latter, however, Trump has an amazing defense. Saudi Arabian officials, the Republican declared last week, have \u201cagreed to pay for the cost of those troops. They\u2019ve agreed to pay fully for the cost of everything we\u2019re doing over there\u2026. Saudi Arabia is paying for 100 percent of the cost, including the cost of our soldiers. And that negotiation took a very short time \u2013 like, maybe, about 35 seconds.\u201d\n\nIn other words, there were private negotiations \u2013 which the White House had not previously disclosed \u2013 between the Trump administration and Saudi officials, and as part of those talks, Saudi Arabia agreed to pay \u201cfor 100 percent of the costs\u201d of the American troop deployment, \u201cincluding the cost of our soldiers.\u201d\n\nTo hear Trump tell it, this will be the first time in American history that U.S. troops have been deployed abroad at literally no cost to taxpayers. It led the Washington Post to wonder what in the world the president was talking about.\n\nWhite House officials would not explain what Trump meant. So, we checked with the Pentagon for more details on the supposed payment arrangement. Officials at the Defense Department deflected our inquiry. [\u2026] We checked with the relevant committees in the House and the Senate \u2013 Defense, Foreign Affairs and Appropriations \u2013 and none could report an understanding of the president\u2019s claim. The Saudi Embassy did not respond with an explanation, either.\n\nEventually, the State Department gave the Post a vague statement about \u201cburden-sharing among partners,\u201d which shed no light on whether the president\u2019s odd claim had any bearing on reality.\n\nAll of which suggests the Trump administration wasn\u2019t sure how best to explain the president\u2019s strange claim.\n\nI realize, of course, that \u201cTrump peddles bizarre lie\u201d is a routine headline, but in the not-too-distant past, an American president caught saying something untrue about U.S. troop deployments would expect to face a significant controversy.\n\nIn 2019, against an avalanche of presidential falsehoods, it\u2019s the sort of claim that leads to a lot of shrugged shoulders.", "description": "In the not-too-distant past, an American president caught saying something untrue about U.S. troop deployments would expect to face a significant controversy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/nadler_ap_break.jpg?itok=DjexMTkD", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
