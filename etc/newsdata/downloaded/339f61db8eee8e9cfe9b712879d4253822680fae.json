Both Defense Secretary Mark Esper and new Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, officials said, were informed beforehand.\n\n\u201cDespite continued misreporting to the contrary, Secretary Esper and Chairman Milley were consulted over the last several days by the President regarding the situation and efforts to protect U.S. forces in northern Syria in the face of military action by Turkey,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said.\n\nThe White House said Monday it will move between 50 and 100 special forces away from a buffer zone near the border to other locations inside Syria. The U.S. has roughly 1,000 troops inside the country.\n\nThe decision comes as Turkey begins a military operation against the U.S.-backed Syrian Defense Forces, a key American ally in the fight against the Islamic State. Turkey considers elements of the Kurdish-led SDF to be terrorists and a threat to Turkey\u2019s national security.\n\nThe White House and Pentagon have condemned the looming invasion.\n\n\u201cThe department\u2019s position has been and remains that establishing a safe zone in northern Syria is the best path forward to maintaining stability,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \u201cUnfortunately, Turkey has chosen to act unilaterally. As a result we have moved the U.S. forces in northern Syria out of the path of potential Turkish incursion to ensure their safety. We have made no changes to our force presence in Syria at this time.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
