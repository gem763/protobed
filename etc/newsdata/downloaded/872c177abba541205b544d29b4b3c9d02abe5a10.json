And why employ a choreographer, albeit a distinguished one, Wayne McGregor, to direct an opera?\n\nENO's Orpheus season kicks off with a production of Gluck's 1762 opera with a strong singing cast consisting of Sarah Tynan, Soraya Mafi and Alice Coote (above with Mafi)\n\nIt\u2019s true that Orpheus has a lot of dancing, but the music should be more than a backdrop to a ballet, especially one that is presented here in a random and unfocused way.\n\nThe singers \u2013 a good trio of Alice Coote, Sarah Tynan and Soraya Mafi \u2013 drift around between the dancers, trying to stop the plot being submerged. But only in the final section, with the dancers dismissed, do the singers dominate in the way they should.\n\nMusically, things are pretty secure under Harry Bicket\u2019s experienced direction. But the chorus, vital in this work, often sound muffled, hidden offstage.\n\nI suspect, despite reservations, that this opera will be more recommendable than the other three to come over the coming months.\n\nOffenbach\u2019s Orpheus In The Underworld has been assigned to the controversial Emma Rice, whose tenure at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe was cut short. She has, apparently, rewritten it. Buyer beware.\n\nHarrison Birtwistle\u2019s Mask Of Orpheus is a serious commercial risk for a cash- strapped company. Birtwistle can empty a theatre more effectively than bubonic plague. When last I looked there were 7,000 unsold seats!\n\nFinally, Philip Glass\u2019s Orph\u00e9e is a squib that has never been either popular or successful. But ENO has a knack with Glass, so fingers crossed.", "description": "This Orpheus And Eurydice is the first of four Orpheus-themed operas running at the Coliseum this autumn, in which English National Opera is taking formidable artistic and financial risks.", "authors": ["David Mellor For Event"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/15/19255702-0-image-a-15_1570111790319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
