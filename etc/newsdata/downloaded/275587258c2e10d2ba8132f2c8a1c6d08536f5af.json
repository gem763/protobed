I also had a demanding job as editor-in-chief of Elle magazine.\n\nWe decided to call the column \u2018I Don\u2019t Know How I Do It\u2019 as a light-hearted reference to a popular parenting phrase of the time.\n\nNow, despite having four children aged five to 14, and writing this, my last-ever column for this newspaper as I move to a new job, I can honestly say I\u2019m still no nearer to figuring it out.\n\nLorraine Candy and her family, bidding farewell to her Femail column after 5 years. Pictured (left to right), daughter Gracie, husband James, daughter Mabel, son Henry, Lorraine and oldest daughter Sky\n\nI did it, that\u2019s all I know. And continue to do it. But how well? Well enough, I\u2019d say. And that, believe me, is as good as it gets for all mothers \u2014 whatever their circumstances.\n\nOriginally, I wanted to call the column \u2018All The Rage\u2019, because the \u2018struggle to juggle\u2019, with its never-ending to-do lists, schedules and itineraries, always made me cross.\n\nBut I was told \u2018grumpy mum\u2019 wasn\u2019t the maternal role model anyone wanted to read about. Instead, I decided to write a light-hearted chronicle of my offspring\u2019s growing pains \u2014 and mine, too \u2014 as we steered the family craft through choppy waters.\n\nWhat I hadn\u2019t realised when I embarked back in 2009 was that a seismic shift in society\u2019s attitude to mothering was under way.\n\nExperts were telling us that, instead of a newborn fitting into your world, you were expected to build your life around the baby.\n\nThis child-centred approach piled extra emotional pressure on all mothers, but I believe working mums \u2014 especially those who had to go back to their jobs \u2014 felt the stress of it most keenly.\n\nWe decided to call the column \u2018I Don\u2019t Know How I Do It\u2019 as a light-hearted reference to a popular parenting phrase of the time. Pictured, Lorraine with daughter Mabel\n\nMany of us almost crumbled with the guilt at the possibility of getting it all wrong.\n\nThis guilt was the basis of many of my columns \u2014 and I know from the reaction from readers that I was not suffering alone.\n\nLike thousands of other mothers, I had sleepless nights over not breastfeeding my children to late toddlerhood, and again over the ever-changing thinking on co-sleeping \u2014 sleeping with your baby.\n\nAll this was labelled \u2018the new Momism\u2019, a parenting style that seemed to bestow hero-like status on being a mother, valuing it above everything else in your life.\n\nCrikey, it was stressful and confusing and, looking back over the 350-odd columns, I can see how powerfully influential any new thinking on parenting can be. The main theme of everything I\u2019ve written is: \u2018Am I doing this right?\u2019\n\nThe columns have been a relentless quest for the best rules on being a good mum.\n\nThe columns have been a relentless quest for the best rules on being a good mum\n\nNow, of course, as a mother of four children aged five, ten, almost 13 and 14, I can see this search for the parenting commandments is ridiculous. They don\u2019t exist.\n\nMothering is like the scene in The Wizard Of Oz when Dorothy goes behind the curtain to find there is no wizard and she\u2019s got to work out how to get back home on her own.\n\nI had my first baby at 33 and my last at 43, so I\u2019ve spent a decade reading more parenting books than this family of six have used loo rolls \u2014 yet all I can offer is this obvious, but effective, advice: there is no right way, only your way.\n\nAs long as everyone is alive, enough limbs intact to dunk a biscuit into a soothing cup of tea at the end of the day, then you\u2019re more than likely doing OK.\n\nI realised this once my eldest hit her teens. Nothing prepares you for the tsunami of unpredictable behaviour you face with a teen. It\u2019s like being on a rollercoaster naked and blindfolded . . . EVERY DAY.\n\nNow, as I watch her fingers slip through mine into adulthood, I know it doesn\u2019t matter a jot how long I breastfed her for, or whether she was in the perfect sleep routine.\n\nWould she get higher grades if I had been there at every school pick-up with a sugarless snack?\n\nWould she be on course to win a Pulitzer Prize if I\u2019d seen every school play? Would she be the scientist who cures cancer if I\u2019d given up my career to hothouse her? Who can say and does it matter, anyway?\n\nMothering is like the scene in The Wizard Of Oz when Dorothy goes behind the curtain to find there is no wizard and she\u2019s got to work out how to get back home on her own. Pictured (left to right), Gracie, Sky and Henry\n\nBut does she know I love her? Does she know that everything she\u2019s done from the day she promised me 1,000 kisses every bedtime to the day this week she set fire to the toaster is wonderful to me? I think she does, and that is the most important thing.\n\nShe says please and thank you in public, opens doors for the elderly and often flushes the loo.\n\nFrankly, this is the best you can hope for.\n\nBeing a mum is, indeed, brilliant. It\u2019s unpredictable, hilarious, heart-breaking and uplifting at the same time, and makes you question your own mortality and morality.\n\nIt exposes you to more germs than licking a laboratory Petri dish and makes your pain threshold so high you can tread on Lego barefoot and remain silent, so as not to wake a newborn you\u2019ve spent hours rocking to sleep.\n\nBut motherhood is not the only thing that matters in life \u2014 this much I do know, whatever the experts say.\n\nChoose to work or not: it is up to you, but remember, whichever option you choose doesn\u2019t make you a better mother than the woman who makes the alternative decision, and no mother has the right to judge another.\n\nSo thank you for following the six of us over the years. You\u2019ve been there through seven Christmases and New Years, through two first days at school, through one birth and maternity leave, through the loss of a beloved grandparent and father, the death of a much-hugged dog and a million early-morning episodes of Peppa Pig.\n\nBeing a mum is, indeed, brilliant. It\u2019s unpredictable, hilarious, heart-breaking and uplifting at the same time, and makes you question your own mortality and morality. Pictured, Gracie and Mabel\n\nTime has sped past faster than I could have imagined. Gracie-in-the-middle once perfectly described what it felt like, when she said it was as if the world keeps turning, but everything stops moving.\n\nTime stands still in the moments you are kissing your newborn\u2019s head, clutching your toddler\u2019s tiny hands or waving your teenagers goodbye.\n\nJust remember to make the most of every minute of it.\n\nCandy Chronicle: The Highlights\n\nHello Mabel (June 23, 2011)\n\nThe day our little brunette firecracker arrived, I shared one picture of her on the relatively new social media platform called Twitter. This was unusual in those days \u2014 how times have changed.\n\nNow, births are live-tweeted or filmed for Facebook. Is this the ultimate in oversharing, or is it a wonderful way to celebrate the miracle of human birth?\n\nI don\u2019t really know the answer to that, but I was in my 40s when I had Mabel and am certainly the oldest mum at school drop-off these days.\n\nI have learnt much from the Mabelanator, as she has become known, and am of the opinion that, if you could choose your birth order, you should choose to be the fourth child. Everyone adores you.\n\nGoodbye to Grandpa (June 13, 2013)\n\nThe most heart-breaking dilemma we have faced as parents was the loss of a parent \u2014 and how to tell our children.\n\nMy husband James\u2019s father William died more suddenly than we\u2019d ever imagined possible, aged 68 of leukaemia, three years ago.\n\nHow do you tell a child they will never again be able to see a man who has been in their life since they were born?\n\nHis loss pierced our souls and cast a dark shadow that we still feel today. At the time, my children were aged between two and ten. We said nothing the day we found out he had died \u2014 it was half-term and we were on holiday in Cornwall. We took some time to process the news ourselves and waited until the day we returned home to sit them on the sofa and explain what had happened, watching how each absorbed the shock.\n\nI marvel constantly at how strong children are, how they cope in times of stress.\n\nOver the days and weeks and months that followed, memories of Grandpa popped out, their little minds dealing with it as best they knew how and living entirely in the moment as children do. We noticed they coped better than us.\n\nMum guilt: Returning to work from maternity leave (January 25, 2012)\n\nOne of the reasons I wanted to write this column was to encourage a debate about making life easier for work-ing mothers.\n\nGoing back to work after having a child \u2014 however long you take off \u2014 is a tough decision. But one thing I know now, which I didn\u2019t during each of four maternity breaks, is I wish I had saved the time for teenage maternity leave.\n\nYour children need you more the older they get, so don\u2019t let the agony of saying goodbye to your baby overwhelm you. Babies don\u2019t remember that bit, it\u2019s more about you than them. If you can be around more as they hit the tricky teens, then that\u2019s far more useful.\n\nThe most useful phrase I have encountered in all the stuff I\u2019ve read on parenting is \u2018it takes a village to raise a child\u2019\n\nNannygate (November 22, 2010)\n\nThe most useful phrase I have encountered in all the stuff I\u2019ve read on parenting is \u2018it takes a village to raise a child\u2019.\n\nObviously, you love your children but, guess what: other people, not related to them, can love them too. And in the past 14 years, we have employed three wonderful nannies who have really loved our offspring.\n\nThis seems to concern many judgmental, ignorant and illogical nitwits who find it hard to accept that couples who both work need some form of childcare.\n\nI have had more online trolling and unpleasant comments about employing a nanny than anything else I have ever written about.\n\nI reckon if I\u2019d chucked a cat in a wheelie bin, I would have received less vitriol than over mentioning my nanny.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the word \u2014 perhaps \u2018childminder\u2019, \u2018grandmother\u2019, \u2018nursery assistant\u2019 or \u2018after-school carer\u2019 are more pleasing than the old-school connotations of the word \u2018nanny\u2019.\n\nFrankly, I don\u2019t care; having a nanny is not a privilege or a perk, it is a necessity.\n\nIt\u2019s nearly 2017, forgoodnessnakes (as my son used to say). Parenting is not the sole responsibility of the human without manbits.\n\nIt\u2019s an equal partnership and, sometimes, we need paid assistance to make it work out for everyone. We call ours a nanny. Get over it.\n\nBut running a family of four would not have been possible without the support of my husband of 16 years, James. Pictured, Lorraine holding baby Mabel\n\nNo more babies (November 28, 2013)\n\nWe\u2019re done now, our family is complete and Mr Candy will no doubt remain ever grateful I shared the story of him having the snip with a few million readers.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t stop me obsessing over newborns, holding that little bit too long the ones the new mums in my office bring to work. I love babies in the over-the-top manner of some people who adore cats.\n\nBut running a family of four would not have been possible without the support of my husband of 16 years, James.\n\nThis is equal parenting in action: he does the dentist trips, I do the doctors, we tag team sports days and school plays.\n\nHe is the non-confrontational voice of patient reason in a household of fiery, energetic, chaotic and unpredictable personalities.\n\nFrankly, he is the rock that holds the whole volcano together.
