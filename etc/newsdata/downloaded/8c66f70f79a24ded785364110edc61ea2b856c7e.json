While renters' groups in Munich are pushing for a six-year freeze, other German cities have yet to follow Berlin's lead amid concerns that the action could complicate the development of new homes.\n\nThe deal between Berlin's Social Democrats, Greens and the Left party paves the way for the city's legislature to approve the measures this week before bringing them into force in the first quarter of 2020. The final agreement was hashed out over a two-day marathon late last week after months of talks.\n\nBerlin's largest apartment owner has lost about a fifth of its market value since the rent-freeze plan was announced in June.
