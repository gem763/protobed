There are so many different numbers on there which simply don't add up.\n\n\"They are not mathematics, but more likely some weird occult materials...They go from top to bottom, side-to-side and run across each other without making sense.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n(Image: Maxppp/PA Images)\n\n\"One possibility is that they are orders for the family members to walk around in circles. But there is also likely some other twisted truth behind them.\"\n\nInvestigators believed the family members had been brainwashed into believing the end of the world was coming.\n\nThe incident came into light when Gerrit's eldest son Jan Zon van Dorsten revealed his ordeal after drinking five beers in a nearby bar, police claim.\n\nEarlier this week tofficers arrested a 58-year-old man, known as 'Josef B', in connection with holding the youngsters at the farmhouse.\n\n(Image: Vincent Jannink/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nBoth Gerrit and Josef were identified as members of the Unification Church, commonly known as the Moonies.\n\nThe cult was founded in the 1950s by the South Korean preacher Sun Myung Moons, who believed he was the Messiah.\n\nPolice found that the two men were neighbours living at Hasslet, around five miles from the farmhouse.\n\nA source added that they kept five sheep and had a circular portable pond where a duck swam around in circles.", "description": "Police in the Netherlands have reportedly found a white board with drawings and numberings on that are being investigated", "authors": ["Tiffany Lo", "Image", "Vincent Jannink Epa-Efe Rex", "Maxppp Pa Images", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20658086.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Father-with-children-has-been-in-cellar-in-Drenthe-for-years-Ruinerwold-Netherlands-16-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
