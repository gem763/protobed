Protesters have hurled bricks and petrol bombs at police, who have responded with baton charges and volleys of tear gas on city streets.\n\nHong Kong's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has rejected the demands and on Saturday backed the use of force by police against protesters, amid criticism of heavy-handed tactics.\n\nMore than 90% of a 3,200-strong alumni at Hong Kong University on Saturday passed a motion calling for Lam's resignation, saying students had suffered \"injuries from police brutality\" while in custody.\n\nHong Kong has been relatively calm in the past two weeks after violent protests ignited by the introduction of colonial-era emergency laws.\n\nA prayer sit-in was scheduled downtown on Saturday evening, while demonstrations on Friday were calm, with protesters forming a human chain along the metro network and many donning masks in defiance of a ban on covering faces at public rallies.\n\n\n\n\n\nBRACING FOR VIOLENCE\n\nProtesters are concerned that Beijing is eroding freedoms granted when Britain handed the city back to China in 1997.\n\nChina denies the accusation and has blamed foreign nations such as the United States and Britain for inciting the unrest.\n\nThe crisis in the Chinese-ruled city is the worst since the handover and poses the biggest popular challenge to China's President Xi Jinping since he took power.\n\nThe unrest was sparked by a now withdrawn bill which would have allowed extradition to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. It has since widened into a pro-democracy movement.\n\nHong Kong's metro, which daily moves an estimated 5 million people, has been struggling to return to normal services after being targeted by hardcore protesters, with stations set on fire and ticketing machines damaged.\n\nMany protesters believe the metro has been closing stations to hinder their movement.\n\nHong Kong's subway operator, MTR Corp Ltd said on Saturday that some services will not stop at Kowloon station, which is on the route of Sunday's march, and will again close the network early. Kowloon district has seen some of the worst violence in recent weeks.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city's de-facto central bank, said on Saturday that some cash machines will be out of service temporarily, owing to vandalism or to safety considerations.\n\nGambling authorities in the city, where horse-racing is a passion, have also said some betting shops will close on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Tom Westbrook and Twinnie Siu; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan and Ros Russell)", "description": "Pro-democracy leaders called on Hong Kong's citizens to join a Sunday anti-government march in spite of the risk of arrest, after police banned the rally which is seen as a test of the protest movement's strength following months of unrest.
