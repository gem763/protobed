Zeder is expected to receive around R6.4bn, with net cash of around R4.82bn available after meeting certain obligations.\n\nThe group expects to distribute between R4.25bn and R4.75bn to shareholders and invest the remainder of the net proceeds into its existing portfolio or new opportunities.\n\nThe contemplated disposal had a positive impact on the share price of Pioneer Foods and, in turn, on Zeder's SOTP (sum-of-the-parts) value during the period under review, according to Celliers.\n\nZeder will, therefore, now proceed to vote in favour of this transaction at a general meeting of Pioneer Foods shareholders in October 2019.\n\nTough trading conditions\n\nHowever, Celliers said on Tuesday, notwithstanding seasonal variances, Zeder's portfolio continued to trade under extremely difficult conditions during the interim period until the end of August 2019.\n\nDuring the interim period, there was an 11% increase in its SOTP per share to R6.25, as at August 31, 2019.\n\nThe SOTP value per share is calculated using the quoted market prices for all JSE-listed investments, and internal valuations for unlisted investments. At the close of business on Monday, 30 September 2019, Zeder's SOTP value per share was R6.22.\n\nZeder's recurring headline earnings per share decreased by 63% to 3.6 cents due to prevailing challenging macro conditions, it said in a statement.\n\nOutlook\n\nRegarding Zeder\u2019s investment in Zaad, as a strategic holding company that invests and operates in the specialised agri-inputs industry with a focus on emerging markets, Zeder has committed an additional R300m investment in the company to enable two transactions.\n\nZaad acquired all the remaining shares in Farm-Ag and concluded transaction agreements to acquire a 40% stake in the EAS group of companies in Kenya, with an option to acquire an additional stake in the future.\n\nCelliers said the negative macro conditions are likely to remain unchanged in the short to medium term, but will likely improve over the longer term.\n\nAs a result, earnings and valuations at both a Zeder and portfolio level are expected to be subdued during the next reporting period, in his view.\n\n\"Notwithstanding these challenges, and particularly in light of the anticipated Pioneer Foods disposal, Zeder should be in an improved position to create value for its shareholders through this cycle,\" he said.\n\nIn line with its policy, Zeder will declare a final dividend at year end.", "description": "While earnings and valuations at both Zeder and portfolio level are expected to be subdued during the next reporting period, CEO Norman Celliers has said he anticipates an \"improved position to create value for shareholders\" \u2013 particularly in light of the anticipated disposal of Pioneer Foods.", "authors": ["Compiled Carin Smith"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2885/10e61090f37e4c9983d01005d436b88d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
