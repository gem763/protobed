SUBS NOT USED: Popovic, Ivanic, Srdan Babic, Jander BOOKED: Milunovic MANAGER: Vladan Milojevic 5 REFEREE: Marco Guida (Italy)\n\nSo this must have felt good for Pochettino: five goals and a dominant display against the champions of Serbia who arrived in form and left in tatters.\n\nHarry Kane set them on the way and Son Heung-min scored twice.\n\nWhen he was substituted in the second half, it took Son an age to make it around the perimeter of the pitch as he stopped to shake hands with well-wishers. Such was the sense of relief.\n\nErik Lamela fired in the fourth and Kane grabbed his second and there might have been more but five was plenty.\n\nPochettino needed a win and here it was, with added style. Compared to this stage of last season's Champions League, Spurs are positively flying, with four points compared to one and the morale tanks replenished.\n\nHome fans joined together in chorus of support for their manager. He's magic you know, which had been the soundtrack to Madrid but has not been heard quite as frequently as his team stumbled to only three wins in a dozen games.\n\nConfidence crashed to the floor after Bayern but the salvage operation started as early as the ninth minute on Tuesday night when Kane pounced to score the opener from a corner.\n\nLamela whipped the ball across and Kane escaped Milos Degenek to finish smartly with a glancing header.\n\nIf anyone was going to jolt Tottenham back to life it was always likely to be their talisman, captain in the absence of Hugo Lloris.\n\nKane had spoken sensibly on the eve of this game about how this was the toughest period since his breakthrough and how the players were determined to work out a solution, and they backed his words with the urgency and aggression often missing in recent weeks.\n\nAll eyes were on Son from the off following the news that he had earned a nomination for the 2019 Ballon d'Or award\n\nDele Alli was one of the players to retain their place in the side following the disappointing 1-1 draw with Watford on Saturday\n\nTottenham's fast start seemed to catch the visitors by surprise as Red Star Belgrade boss Vladan Milojevic looked on in shock\n\nBorjan was called into action early in the contest as Tottenham looked to produce a performance to put their season on track\n\nKane's goal offered encouragement and the passes started to find feet with more zip and even a trace of swagger. Serge Aurier released Lamela who checked onto his left foot and picked out Son at the back post.\n\nSon met the cross on the half-volley and thumped it past goalkeeper Milan Borjan. Tottenham were two goals up with only 16 minutes played and in complete control.\n\nBorjan made saves to deny Tanguy Ndombele and Lamela and a noisy pocket of Red Star supporters in the top tier continued to cheer their team on, in defiance of a UEFA ban imposed as part of a penalty for racist behaviour in a qualifier in Finland, earlier this season.\n\nMore than 200 away fans were permitted as part of a corporate hospitality package \u2013 immune from the ban, apparently, which seemed strange but perfectly viable given UEFA's usual illogical stance on these matters.\n\nBut this was not the same raucous crowd up high in the North Stand whose presence was being investigated on Tuesday night.\n\nFor 20 minutes before the interval, Red Star found some rhythm and caused Spurs wobbled at the back.\n\nRajiv van la Parra out-jumped Aurier and Paulo Gazzaniga needed two attempts to gather his header.\n\nPochettino's side may have been ahead but their brittle confidence was in evidence. Another poor defensive header, this time by Jan Vertonghen, presented a shooting chance to Tomane and he lashed it over from outside the penalty area.\n\nThen Marko Marin missed the target from eight yards. Marin barely made an appearance in this country during four years as a Chelsea player but settled nicely in Serbia to become Red Star's captain and creator-in-chief.\n\nTottenham chief Daniel Levy was an interested spectator as he arrived looking for an improvement on their dismal season\n\nKane and Son showed why they are the clubs prized assets as both were a class above the troubled Red Star defenders\n\nTackles were flying in from both sides as the visitors tried to ruffle Tottenham in a bid to get a foothold to get back in the game\n\nHis return to London, however, will not be one he remembers fondly. Moments before half-time, he was dispossessed on the half-way line by Ndombele, who carried the ball forward and slid a pass to Son who scored his second of the night.\n\nThis was the game. There would be no fight back.\n\nThe perfect settler for Pochettino just before the interval and Spurs stretched away after the restart.\n\nLamela's first half performance deserved a goal and the chances fell his way. He blazed one over and dragged one wide, a horrible finish when clean through, but found the net after fine link-up play by Kane and a cross from Aurier.\n\nKane slid in his second of the night and his 15th for club and country in 15 appearances this season.\n\nSuddenly the positives abound. Even the goal difference column was no longer negative. Liverpool next, at Anfield.\n\nBut Son continued to use his trickery and his pace to cause problems as he showed why he is deserving of his nomination\n\nErik Lamela, who bagged two assists in the first half, added a goal of his own in the second with a clever finish on the turn\n\nThe Argentine has had a difficult season so far but showed his quality in the Champions League against Red Star Belgrade\n\nKane made it 5-0, grabbing his second of the night, in the second half to add further gloss to a positive evening for Spurs", "description": "MATT BARLOW AT THE TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR STADIUM: Positives have been in short supply for Pochettino especially in the goal difference column since the visit of Bayern Munich..", "authors": ["Matt Barlow For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/22/20056130-0-image-a-10_1571778910398.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
