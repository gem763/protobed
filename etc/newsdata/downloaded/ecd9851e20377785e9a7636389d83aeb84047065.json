Photo: Getty Images\n\nFresh off of fighting with Debra Messing, Donald Trump just can\u2019t control his Twitter fingers. His feud with Chrissy Teigen has reached a comical new height, that is, if it\u2019s funny that the president of the United States is tweeting mean things about a prominent citizen. Maybe in a dark way. Furious about an NBC special on criminal justice reform featuring John Legend and probably just after watching the promo video for it, Donald Trump tweeted a thread insulting John Legend, NBC, Lester Holt, and innocent bystander Chrissy Teigen, who had nothing to do with the special. Trump began the thread by praising his own work on criminal justice reform for having \u201csigned it into law,\u201d referring to the First Step Act, which reduced mandatory sentences for some offenses. \u201cGuys like boring musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is - but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed,\u201d Trump wrote in two tweets. Naturally, Teigen, who is blocked by the president, wasn\u2019t settling for subtweets.\n\nlol what a pussy ass bitch. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\n\u201cThe absolute best part of his tweet is I literally didn\u2019t speak in the special, nor was I mentioned,\u201d she said in a second tweet. \u201cI\u2019m cackling at the pointless addition of me because he cannot not be a bitch.\u201d And because this is the internet #PresidentPussyAssBitch began to take over the timeline. The only problem is: Twitter refused to let the dirty words trend. According to The Independent, \u201ctracking data by social media firm Keyhole showed the hashtag was seen by far more US users than the hashtag in top place,\u201d which was Trump\u2019s \u201c#filthymouthedwife.\u201d So, it looks like once again, Trump lost the popular vote, but the system erred in his favor.\n\nChrissy Teigen just said hold my gold and proceeded to humiliate the leader of the free world with a soundbite tweet that slaps all offkey like a RZA beat. I have no choice but to stan https://t.co/S76EggHtnj \u2014 Zaron Burnett III (@Zaron3) September 9, 2019\n\nIf @johnlegend & @chrissyteigen don't want #PresidentPussyAssBitch to trend then we must respect their wishes during this difficult time. https://t.co/bf2bEfrUeV \u2014 W.
