Before the meeting, diplomats who worked on the deal said success would mean increasing the number of countries supporting the plan to 12.\n\nThey didn't reach that target. French European Affairs Minister Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin told reporters ,\u201cWe have been able to enlarge the circle of countries willing to support us with this rapid relocation in case of new boat arrivals. There are around 10 countries ready to take part.\u201d\n\nHowever, diplomats said just three countries expressed a clear desire to join in \u2014 Luxembourg, Ireland and Portugal \u2014 with several others yet to make a decision.\n\nItalian Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese said, \"Three or four countries ... have said they are available\" and added that \"we must try to broaden the sharing.\u201d She said more work would be done to sell the merits of the plan in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Malta deal, signed in Valletta last month, envisages a temporary voluntary relocation mechanism for asylum seekers rescued at sea. The accord is seen as the first step toward a permanent relocation mechanism as well as a test of the will of other EU countries to help Italy where, even though arrival numbers are not that high, the issue is highly political. The far right, which was in power until August, used the lack of European solidarity on migration to make electoral gains.\n\n\u201cI understand the political reason, I understand the need to help a pro-EU government ... but looking at the situation on the ground, this deal is irrational,\u201d complained one EU diplomat, referring to the low number of arrivals in the Central Mediterranean.\n\nMinisters were shown a chart detailing the number of first-time asylum applications per 1 million inhabitants between January and July this year. Cyprus, Malta and Greece were at the top and Italy was down in 16th place.\n\nBerlin has invested heavily in the Malta deal, which it sees as a way to help unblock talks on broader reform of EU asylum policy.\n\n\u201cThis is my fight for a common European asylum policy,\u201d German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told reporters on his way into the meeting.\n\nYet he didn't hide his frustration at trying to find potential partners: \u201cWe cannot ask Greece to take refugees also from the Central Mediterranean, Visegrad countries are not willing to receive refugees but ... there are other ways to show solidarity, with personnel and financing. France is contributing, Spain is itself burdened ... We still don't have a government in Belgium.\u201d\n\nOne of the main problems Seehofer and other supporters of the scheme face is that some countries \u2014 including Cyprus and Greece \u2014 are already seeing arrival numbers that are higher than Italy's. Three states \u2014 Greece, Cyprus and Bulgaria \u2014 complained in a document that \u201cin recent months the attention of EU Member States has been mainly focused on the Central Mediterranean\" and that the Eastern Mediterranean route has not been \"properly addressed despite the fact that all relevant reports confirm the increasing, persisting trend of arrivals in this region.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's some bad blood in the corridors for a deal that helps Italy that has no migration crisis,\u201d said a senior EU diplomat.\n\nAnother key issue that has made progress on the Malta deal more difficult is the situation in Turkey. The Turkish defense ministry said on Tuesday that preparations for an offensive in northern Syria have been \"completed,\" raising the prospect of a new humanitarian crisis at Europe's external borders.\n\n\u201cThe dramatic increase in migratory flows in the Greek islands and in other parts of Europe ... tells us that if we want to be serious and not to be caught out for the second time ... we should not ignore the possibility that a new crisis can emerge,\u201d Greek Migration Minister Giorgos Koumoutsakos told POLITICO.", "description": "Low arrival numbers in Italy and rising tensions in Turkey complicate matters for supporters of Central Mediterranean plan.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1163382443-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
