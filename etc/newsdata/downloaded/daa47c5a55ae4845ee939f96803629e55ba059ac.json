Reelgood, the site that sorts through all your streaming services, calculated how many shows and movies each service offers, in a report provided to Lifehacker.\n\nThe Good\n\nDisney owns a lot of premium content \u2014 Marvel, Star Wars, the Muppets, Pirates, Pixar, The Simpsons \u2014 and it\u2019s the only streamer offering most of that content. And Disney+ is just $8.99/month ($89 for a full year). If you want to watch a lot of Disney titles right now, go ahead and subscribe.\n\nDisney+ will also roll out multiple exclusive shows, but you can wait to learn if they\u2019re so good that they justify the subscription. That\u2019s the Foxtel model, where there are fewer titles, but those include one or two essential shows that all your friends are watching. On Foxtel it was Game of Thrones; on Disney+ it\u2019ll be The Mandalorian.\n\nThe Bad\n\nBut if you just want a bigger basket of stuff to watch, then Disney+ is your worst option. It has fewer movies or TV shows than any major streaming service. Because it\u2019s so cheap, Disney+ is a better deal than other smaller services. But it\u2019s still nothing next to Prime and Netflix. I definitely wouldn\u2019t cancel a different service to switch to Disney+.\n\nShould You Get It?\n\nYou should probably wait. And then you should probably get it.\n\nLook at the best titles available from Disney+, listed on Reelgood. If you want to see some of those now, then go ahead and buy a month. It\u2019s not a bad catalogue. It\u2019s just not as good as other catalogues.\n\nBut before you get excited about all the big-deal movies that will only come out on Disney+, think about which ones you like to watch at home, and which you already see at the theatre. If you really plan to watch at least two Disney movies at home every month, then Disney+ is already worth it.\n\nOtherwise, wait until people start watching The Mandalorian and the other exclusive shows, and see if they\u2019re good enough to subscribe and try. Meanwhile you\u2019ve got plenty to watch on all your other services. Have you dug through the Prime app lately? I feel like we always forget it\u2019s sitting there between seasons of Good Omens and Mrs. Maisel.\n\nDon\u2019t stress about this too much. It\u2019s $8.99 a month.", "description": "Disney+, the newest and cheapest major streaming service, gives you less bang for your buck than Netflix, Stan and Prime Video.
