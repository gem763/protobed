(Picture: Beretta/Sims/REX)\n\nWho is the masked man? (Picture: Beretta/Sims/REX)\n\nInstead she was pictured wearing a square diamond ring, rather than the stunning oval-shaped sparkler Bradley Dack used to propose \u2013 although not to panic because Olivia\u2019s beau was seen picking her up after filming (and she was wearing her engagement ring, phew).\n\nThe couple shared their happy news with Olivia\u2019s Instagram followers last weekend with Bradley proposing on their romantic getaway to Dubai.\n\nIn sweet photos shared on her page, Olivia and Bradley are seen kissing and smiling for the camera in front of the Burj Al Arab, while showing off the large diamond ring on her left hand.\n\n\u2018He must be crazy\u2026 Here\u2019s to forever. I love you BD.\u2019 (Picture:Instagram)\n\nOlivia cheekily captioned the announcement: \u2018He must be crazy\u2026 Here\u2019s to forever. I love you BD.\u2019\n\nThe couple were flooded with congratulatory messages from their celebrity pals, including Olivia\u2019s Love Island co-star Gabby Allen, who wrote: \u2018OH MY GOD!!! Congratulations you two. Wowwwwww.\u2019\n\nOlivia\u2019s Love Island bestie Amber Davies was clearly a little overwhelmed with her friend\u2019s happy news and simply wrote: \u2018I JUST CAN\u2019T COPE.\u2019\n\nOther stars to congratulate the newly-engaged couple include Gemma Collins, Bobby Norris, Olivia Buckland, Sam Faiers and Nicola McClean.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s been a fairly rocky road for Olivia and Bradley, who dated before she found fame on ITV\u2019s Love Island in 2017.\n\nThey\u2019ve since broken up several times, most recently in April when Olivia confirmed their split on her Instagram Stories, only to reconcile with the footballer two days later.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
