A completion to Sony Michel in the first quarter did the trick.\n\nBrady overtook Brett Favre for the No. 3 spot with 348 yards in New England's 33-7 Week 5 win over Washington. Drew Brees is the leader, and Brady entered the game 2,922 yards behind the New Orleans Saints signal-caller.\n\nLast season, on Dec. 9, a two-yard toss to Julian Edelman against the Miami Dolphins marked Brady's 580th career touchdown pass in both the regular and postseasons\u2014most in NFL history\u2014and 509th regular-season career touchdown. The latter was enough to best Favre for third on the list for all-time regular-season touchdown passes.\n\nBrady entered Thursday second only to Manning (539) with 527 regular-season touchdown passes.\n\nIt's difficult to remember that Brady was once an unknown sixth-round pick (No. 199 overall) out of Michigan.\n\nThere are few quarterback-related records the six-time Super Bowl champion hasn't challenged. No signal-caller has won as many titles in NFL history. No player has made as many Super Bowl appearances as Brady (nine). In fact, Brady has a stronghold on Super Bowl records in general.\n\nOn top of that, Brady's 14 Pro Bowl nods are tied for the most among all players.\n\nAs for leaderboards Brady can still top, he entered Thursday fourth in career completions (6,122) and fourth in career passer rating (97.6).\n\n\n\nHe should have ample time to keep climbing, as he signed a two-year contract extension with New England ahead of this season.", "description": "Tom Brady  passed  Peyton Manning  to move into second place on the  NFL 's all-time regular-season passing yards list on Thursday night against the  New York Giants .
