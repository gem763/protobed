An \u201cextremely critical\u201d fire weather area, the service\u2019s highest category, was in effect in several counties north of San Francisco.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe winds are on our doorstep,\u201d the service wrote in a tweet Sunday morning.\n\nAD\n\nThe Kincade fire outside Healdsburg, Calif. \u2014 which had consumed at least 26,000 acres and was only 11 percent contained as of early Sunday \u2014 appeared to be rapidly intensifying, according to the National Weather Service, which posted satellite imagery of the expanding blaze.\n\n#KincadeFire 2 am update: GOES-17 Satellite Fire Temperature.

If you are still in this mandatory evacuation area you need to leave now while you still can,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome 90,000 residents in Sonoma County, the heart of California\u2019s wine country, had already evacuated Saturday night on orders from authorities.\n\nFlames from the Kincade fire, which was sparked Wednesday night, could be seen stretching hundreds of feet above the treetops, according to the Fire Weather Research Laboratory at San Jose University.\n\nOfficials, residents and emergency workers have spent the weekend bracing for the abrupt wind change, which came on almost exactly as forecasters expected. The fierce gusts, coupled with low humidity, could feed existing fires or ignite new blazes by knocking over electrical equipment or carrying embers into areas the flames haven\u2019t yet touched. Any fires that do crop up will likely spread rapidly, the National Weather Service said.\n\nAD\n\nConcerns about the fire expanding led Pacific Gas & Electric to conduct a massive power shutdown Saturday evening that will likely mark the largest planned outage in the state\u2019s history. The blackouts, which will affect 38 counties in all, began in Northern California around 5 p.m. local time Saturday and cascaded south through the state throughout the evening, according to a statement from the company. Central California\u2019s Kern County was slated to lose power at 9 p.m. Sunday. Fresno and Madera counties are also expected to lose power at some point, but PG&E hasn\u2019t said when.\n\nIn total, in estimated 940,000 customers, comprising about 2.8 million people, are expected to be without power through the weekend. PG&E said its goal is to restore power to a \u201cvast majority\u201d of customers within 48 hours after the winds have died down.\n\nAD", "description": "The windstorm was expected to pummel the region throughout the morning, creating \u201cpotentially historic fire weather conditions,\" according to the National Weather Service.", "authors": ["Derek Hawkins", "National", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/006byoaDbbN9a3VC0wdT9TomDcM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HGWLXDXYPUI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
