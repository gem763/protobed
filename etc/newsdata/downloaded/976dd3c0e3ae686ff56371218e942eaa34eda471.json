His family shared the news in an official statement and urged his fans to celebrate him by listening to his words.\n\n\u201cIt is with great sadness we confirm our beloved Robert passed away yesterday night. He died peacefully at home in his bed, surrounded by love.

Around the same time, Hunter participated in the government-sponsored LSD tests with writer Ken Kesey that took place at Stanford University, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nWhen Garcia formed an electric rock group called the Warlocks that later became the Grateful Dead, Hunter decided to focus solely on lyrics. He was known by his bandmates as \u201cthe band member that doesn\u2019t come on stage with us.\u201d\n\nHunter\u2019s most well-known songs include \u201cDark Star,\u201d \u201cUncle John\u2019s Band\u201d and the band\u2019s biggest radio hit, \u201cTouch of Grey.\u201d\n\nAlthough Hunter was known most for collaborating with Garcia, the lyricist also wrote songs with Elvis Costello, Bruce Hornsby and Bob Dylan, according to Rolling Stone.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a way with words and I do too,\u201d Dylan previously told the magazine. \u201cWe both write a different type of song than what passes today for songwriting.\u201d", "description": "The lyricist was known to the bandmates as\u00a0\u201cthe band member that doesn\u2019t come on stage with us.\u201d", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8a667424000032007cd470.jpeg?cache=okeebsgyyt&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
