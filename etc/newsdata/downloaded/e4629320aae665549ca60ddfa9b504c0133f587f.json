The washing-up.\u201d (Auntie B is very much of the \u201cidle hands make the devil\u2019s work\u201d school of thought, in which nearly any personal problem can be cured by more housework or prayer.)\n\nOne such conversation returns to me regularly. At university, a classmate claimed never to have eaten a ready meal or convenience food. \u201cNot even oven chips?\u201d I asked, agog.\n\n\u201cI very rarely eat chips, Coco,\u201d she said, firmly.

I wish I had put it to my classmate back then that perhaps her wealthy family had more time; maybe having a cleaner meant chores could give way to food prep.\n\nInstead, the shame sank in and stayed. But I am learning to decouple the guilt from food. A few days ago, I took a packed lunch to work \u2013 cheese sandwich, packet of Skips, banana. There was a brief moment when I felt embarrassed lifting the lid, comparing it with my colleague\u2019s pulses and roasted veg. And she did look and judge, but perhaps not in the way I feared. \u201cSkips, eh?\u201d she said. \u201cCan I have one?\u201d", "description": "A few days ago, I took a packed lunch to work \u2013 cheese sandwich, packet of Skips, banana", "authors": ["Coco Khan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8c3b4069dc9d887fa3d66b78e9f4a30c7fb570c/0_241_7220_4332/master/7220.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eabee4bae6381283ebfb165d6d19d780", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
