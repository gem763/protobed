(John Woods/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nAntonio Brown faces discipline by the Oakland Raiders after the star wide receiver and General Manager Mike Mayock had a heated confrontation Wednesday.\n\nThe team has not announced how it plans to proceed with Brown but is believed to be mulling its options, which include fining, suspending or perhaps even releasing the seven-time Pro Bowl player.\n\nBrown and Mayock had an animated discussion Wednesday after Brown posted on social media a photo of a fine letter from the team, according to a person familiar with the situation. That could lead to further disciplinary action by the Raiders against Brown, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the team had made no official announcement.\n\nAgent Drew Rosenhaus, who represents Brown, told the NFL Network that Brown had been told to stay home Thursday but had not been told anything definitive about possible disciplinary measures as of Thursday night. Rosenhaus said that he was \u201ctrying to work through this\u201d with the Raiders and his \u201cgoal is to work everything out.\u201d\n\nThe NFL Network reported that Brown is not expected to play in the Raiders\u2019 opening game Monday night against Denver but did not specify whether that would result from a suspension without pay or a deactivation with pay. A deactivation could serve to give the Raiders more time to make a final decision.\n\nAccording to a report by ESPN, the team plans to suspend Brown. The league-owned NFL Network reported that Brown threatened to punch Mayock in the face during the confrontation, which did not actually become physical, and then punted a football and told Mayock to fine him for that. The Athletic reported that teammates had to restrain Brown.\n\nOne of the players holding Antonio Brown back from the near-altercation with GM Mike Mayock was ... Vontaze Burfict. \u2014 Vic Tafur (@VicTafur) September 5, 2019\n\nBrown did not participate in the Raiders\u2019 practice Thursday. Mayock, the former draft analyst for the NFL Network who\u2019s in his first year as GM, spoke to reporters briefly at the Raiders\u2019 facility but did not address specifics or take questions from the media.\n\n\u201cAntonio Brown is not in the building today,\u201d Mayock said. \u201cHe won\u2019t be practicing. I don\u2019t have any more information for you right now. And when I have some and it becomes appropriate, you guys will all get it. I promise you. But that\u2019s it for today.\u201d\n\nShort and sweet from #Raiders GM Mike Mayock: \u201cAntonio Brown is not in the building today. He won\u2019t be practicing.\u201d Mayock says when the time is appropriate he\u2019ll share more information. @nflnetwork pic.twitter.com/tIoCsGtano \u2014 MJ Acosta (@MJAcostaTV) September 5, 2019\n\nRaiders Coach Jon Gruden, speaking to reporters following Thursday\u2019s practice, said the team would \u201chave an official announcement later,\u201d and like Mayock, he refused to comment on the details of Wednesday\u2019s incident or the club\u2019s plans regarding Brown.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still getting to the bottom of everything,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cAll I can do is comment on the football team. I\u2019m out here on the field coaching the guys that are here. And we\u2019ve got a lot of guys working hard. So we\u2019ll give you the information on Antonio when we have it official and correct and right. I don\u2019t want to speculate any further. I can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nGruden, who is entering the second season of his return to coaching after leaving ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d broadcast booth, acknowledged that the Raiders were preparing for the possibility of being without Brown when the season begins.\n\nAccording to others within the league, the Raiders were believed to be considering the possibility of releasing Brown rather than fining or suspending him and attempting to recoup the guaranteed money in his contract. It was not clear, however, how seriously the team was considering cutting its ties to Brown entirely.\n\nUnder the collective bargaining agreement between the league and the NFL Players Association, a club can suspend a player for as many as four games without pay for conduct detrimental to the team. The player, through the NFLPA, could appeal any disciplinary action.\n\nThe NFLPA had \u201cnot yet\u201d been informed as of early Thursday afternoon that the Raiders intend to suspend Brown, a person close to the situation said. Brown\u2019s representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn Wednesday, Brown posted the photo of a letter he had received from Mayock informing him that he had been fined $13,950 for missing a walk-through on Aug. 22 before the Raiders\u2019 third exhibition game against the Green Bay Packers. That sanction was added to the $40,000 he was fined for missing the final practice of training camp on Aug. 18. That day, Mayock told reporters that \u201cfrom our perspective, it\u2019s time for him to be all in or all out.\u201d\n\nIn the social media post, Brown annotated the photo with a caption that seemed to express his displeasure with the news.\n\n\u201cWhen your own team want to hate but there\u2019s no stopping me now devil is a lie,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEveryone got to pay this year so we clear.\u201d\n\nAntonio Brown posts his displeasure with fines from #Raiders pic.twitter.com/0OMhdwFu7K \u2014 Vic Tafur (@VicTafur) September 4, 2019\n\nBrown would lose $860,294, or one-seventeenth of his 2019 salary of $14.625 million, for each game that he\u2019s suspended without pay. He signed a three-year, $50.1 million contract with the Raiders as part of the offseason trade that sent him to Oakland from the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Raiders also could attempt to recoup a portion of the $30.1 million in guaranteed money in the contract.\n\nBrown began training camp on the non-football injury list due to injuries to his feet, reportedly suffered while undergoing cryotherapy treatments in France in early July. Brown confirmed the injury during interviews on HBO\u2019s \u201cHard Knocks.\u201d\n\nHe also spent a sizable chunk of camp arguing with the NFL over his use of the helmet he has used throughout his career. Brown filed two unsuccessful grievances against the league seeking to be allowed to wear a helmet not approved by the NFL under its joint program with the players\u2019 union, in which various helmet models are evaluated for their ability to absorb impacts.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nFrom August: The Raiders are experiencing the full force of Antonio Brown\u2019s diva act\n\nDaniel Snyder dreamed of owning the Redskins.
