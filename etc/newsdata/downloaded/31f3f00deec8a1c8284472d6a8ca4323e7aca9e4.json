A whole different mentality. We are all moving as one and we are sticking together.\u201d\n\nPhoenix led by 15 points halfway through the final quarter but the Clippers cut it to six on Leonard\u2019s three pointer with less than two minutes remaining. Phoenix\u2019s Tyler Johnson then drained a shot from beyond the arc to blunt the Los Angeles rally.\n\nThe Suns won for the first time since losing centre Deandre Ayton to a 25-game suspension for a failed drug test.\n\nPhoenix also halted a 12-game losing skid to the Clippers.\n\nFrank Kaminsky had 18 points, eight rebounds and six assists for the Suns, who have won two of the season\u2019s first three games for the first time since 2015.\n\n\u201cHolding that team to 22 points in the first quarter means we got off to a great start. They were the Clippers, but we were pretty good,\u201d said coach Monty Williams.\n\nLos Angeles was led by Montrezl Harrell\u2019s 28 points and 27 from Leonard.\n\n\u201cI thought we were late on everything. We deserved to lose,\u201d Clipper coach Doc Rivers said.\n\nElsewhere, Russell Westbrook posted his second straight triple double since joining Houston to lead the Rockets to a 126-123 win over the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nWestbrook recorded his 139th career triple double to pass Magic Johnson for second on the all-time list, behind only Oscar Robertson\u2019s 181.\n\nWestbrook had 28 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds and James Harden had a poor shooting night but still managed 29 points.\n\n\u201cI know nowadays getting a triple-double seems normal, but I take a lot of pride (in it),\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s a great accomplishment. Now, I\u2019m able to be in the history books.\u201d\n\nElsewhere the Miami Heat completed a superb second-half comeback to spoil Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 home opener with a 131-126 overtime victory.\n\nReigning NBA MVP Antetokounmpo led the scoring with 29 points, including a magical buzzer-beating tip-in to force overtime, but was unable to thwart Miami\u2019s victory charge.\n\nThe Heat, missing star Jimmy Butler, had trailed by 21 points in the third quarter but exploded to overwhelm the Bucks down the stretch, outscoring the home team by 16 points in the fourth quarter and overtime.\n\nGoran Dragic led the Miami scoring with 25 points from the bench while Bam Adebayo weighed in with 19 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists.\n\nKendrick Nunn added 18 points while four other Miami players finished with double digit tallies.\n\n\u2013 Highlight reel \u2013\n\nAntetokounmpo delivered a highlight reel moment with his improvised tip-in to tie it up at 121-121.\n\nDown by two with three seconds remaining, the Bucks inbounded to Khris Middleton who launched a long-range effort from the perimeter.\n\nWith the shot falling short, Antetokounmpo collected in mid-air and dropped the ball into the basket to force overtime.\n\nHowever the Heat proved the stronger in overtime, outscoring the Bucks 10-5 to close out the win.\n\nButler missed Wednesday\u2019s season-opening win as well after his girlfriend gave birth to a baby girl. The Heat were also missing power forward James Johnson and shooting guard Dion Waiters.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 The Phoenix Suns held off a fourth quarter charge by the Los Angeles Clippers to squeeze out a 130-122 win on Saturday for their", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/73aa26_milwaukee-giannis-antetokounmpo-was-unable-halt-miami-onslaught-in-131-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
