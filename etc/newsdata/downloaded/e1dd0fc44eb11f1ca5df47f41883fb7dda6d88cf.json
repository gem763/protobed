My family do not have that luxury.\n\n'Our nightmare continues, you cannot see the wounds that you have inflicted, but the scars you have left run deep.'\n\nAndrew Downie, prosecuting, said that despite the DNA result proving she was not Katrice, she continued to message Mrs Walker.\n\nRobinson, 40, (pictured today, right ) who appeared as an extra in the ITVBe reality show, sent Katrice's sister Natasha Walker a friend request on the social networking site. Pictured right: Katrice Lee\n\nAppearing at Wirral Magistrates' Court, Heidi Robinson this week admitted sending the friend request (pictured) and claiming she was Katrice in November last year\n\nUp until November 3, 2018, she still purported to be Katrice and 'thought the result of the DNA test was a cover up and that Natasha Walker herself should be investigated.'\n\nIn a statement, Mrs Walker said she 'felt sick to the pit of my stomach' when she saw the Facebook profile profile.\n\nRichard Lee arriving at Wirral Magistrates Court today\n\nShe said: 'We are going through a living hell and we don't need anything else adding in.'\n\nShe said on her wedding day she had a photo of Katrice, who would have been 40 this year, and a button from her cardigan sewn into her dress.\n\nBut she said that the ordeal and the contact from Robinson ruined her day.\n\nMr Downie added: 'Her wedding felt like the only thing she had done in her life which was for her own happiness as everything else she had done was about finding Katrice and even that, her wedding, was ruined by Robinson.'\n\nKatrice vanished on her second birthday on November 28 1981, on the outskirts of Paderborn in Germany, near the British military base where her father Richard Lee was stationed.\n\nLast month, military police arrested and released without charge an ex-serviceman in connection with her disappearance and began searching a house in Swindon.\n\nAt the sentencing on Wednesday, District Judge Nicholas Sanders said it was clear Robinson had been suffering from a mental illness when she committed the act of 'unimaginable cruelty'.\n\nHe gave her an 18-week prison sentence suspended for two years with a mental health treatment requirement for 12 months and ordered her to carry out rehabilitation activity for 40 days.\n\nNatasha Walker said she was stunned when she received a friend request from an account on Facebook claiming to be that of her missing sister\n\nKatrice (left) was out shopping with her mother Sharon at the Naafi store, near to where her father Richard, a soldier, was stationed. Last year the MOD released an impression of what Katrice Lee could look like at the age of 38 (right)\n\nEmber-Jade Wong, defending, said: 'She had no understanding as to what her offending was, given her condition at the time, believing up until very recently, when she became fitter, that she was Katrice Lee.'\n\nDistrict Judge Sanders said: 'I'm satisfied, based on reports, that you had developed an honestly held belief which I have to accept is hard to understand to people not suffering from it, that you were Katrice Lee.'\n\nRobinson, who wore a black top and trousers with gold hoop earrings, pleaded guilty earlier this month using a public communications network to send a message that was grossly offensive, indecent or menacing on November 3 last year.\n\nSpeaking after a previous hearing, Robinson said: 'I actually believed completely that I was Katrice.\n\nKatrice's father Richard and mother Sharon, who are now separated, from the time of Katrice's disappearance\n\nKatrice's mother Sharon, pictured at the time, said the toddler was 'gone in a matter of seconds'\n\n'I'd had mental health issues leading up to the situation.\n\n'I was then at the time experiencing what I now know to be psychosis.\n\n'I really didn't intend to hurt the family but as I know my actions have done that, I am deeply sorry and that is why I have pleaded guilty.\n\n'I am now getting help and I apologise sincerely to the Lee family and my family.'\n\nRobinson was also ordered to pay \u00a3500 compensation to Mrs Walker, given a restraining order to stop her contacting the Lee family and issued with a nighttime curfew.", "description": "Heidi Robinson, of Moreton, Merseyside, was  told she committed an act of 'unimaginable cruelty' when she impersonated the youngster by setting up a Facebook account in her name.", "authors": ["Ed Riley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/14/20378000-0-image-a-63_1572444367151.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
