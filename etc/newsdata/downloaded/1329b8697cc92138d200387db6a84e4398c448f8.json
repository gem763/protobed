Alan Moore had his own wing, and of course don\u2019t forget about the animated films, Keanu Reeves, Jonah Hex and Shaq. Also: Ryan Reynolds has some thoughts about his role in all of this.\n\nThe DC Comics movies have no unifying thread, no Kevin Feige overseeing everything. This makes them vary dramatically in quality, but it also eliminates any sameness: The bad movies are truly bad, but the ceiling is raised as high as a Christopher Nolan, Richard Donner or Patty Jenkins can take it. It\u2019s quite a journey.\n\nSo, today, we rank the 32 DC Comics movies, including the latest, Joker. We intentionally left off films made from imprints later purchased by DC Comics. So, sorry, Hellboy, Road to Perdition and A History of Violence: You\u2019re excluded here.\n\n32. Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987)\n\nChristopher Reeve called this a \u201ccatastrophe from start to finish,\u201d and if you don\u2019t believe him \u2014 you should really believe Christopher Reeve, by the way, when he tells you a Superman movie is a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d \u2014 you can try sitting through this bargain-bin, basement-price title, made by Cannon Films on a shoestring budget in which even the shoes and the strings don\u2019t look real. Gene Hackman seems to realize immediately that he\u2019s just signed up for a shitshow and hams it up in his final run as Lex Luthor, but nothing could save us from the monstrosity of Nuclear Man, a villain so lame that he\u2019s never mentioned in DC canon again. Honestly, watch this fight scene:\n\nIt makes us sad that Christopher Reeve had to do that.\n\n31. Steel (1997)\n\nWriter-director Kenneth Johnson thought of his hero as a \u201cblue-collar Batman,\u201d and, you know, he\u2019s not entirely wrong: If you took away everything that was cool about Batman and replaced all his tech with tin cans and garbage lids, you might have Steel. This film is widely derided today for its casting of Shaquille O\u2019Neal as the hero, but Shaq, while wooden and cheesy, at least has enough natural charisma to escape mostly unscathed. Judd Nelson, as the villain (repeat: Judd Nelson as the villain!), is not so fortunate. The movie is pitched at the humor and dramatic level of a Bazooka wrapper, and it has roughly the same lasting impact.\n\n30. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)\n\n\u201cBatman vs. Superman is where you go when you admit to yourself that you\u2019ve exhausted all possibilities. It\u2019s like Frankenstein Meets Wolfman or Freddy vs. Jason. It\u2019s somewhat of an admission that this franchise is on its last gasp.\u201d A spot-on review of Zack Snyder\u2019s abysmal 2016 team-up between the two iconic superheroes? Nope, that was what the screenwriter David S. Goyer himself told the Los Angeles Times back in 2005 about Warner Bros.\u2019s previous aborted attempt to make this project happen. Goyer was right then, and he\u2019s right now. Like his spiritual forefather Michael Bay, Snyder is a visionary action filmmaker who conceives blockbusters with an utterly original aesthetic and sensibility. And like Bay, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re any good. The culture has already properly roasted Dawn of Justice\u2019s stupid Martha business, but we\u2019ve yet to fully absorb how much this film tarnished the legacy of Christopher Nolan\u2019s Batman. His Dark Knight was a powerfully conflicted, reluctant hero. By comparison, Sad Affleck was just a dude encased in a metal suit.\n\n29. Catwoman (2004)\n\nMay we humbly submit that the time might be right for a Catwoman solo film? A movie that\u2019s willing to go into the darkest place of Batman, but with the pain, danger, and righteous fury of Catwoman, might have some legs in the current nightmare-scape in which we live. Still, overcoming the stigma of this DOA Halle Berry vehicle might be too tough to accomplish even 15 years later. The problem with Catwoman is that it never thinks about its character any further than \u201cHalle Berry in a catsuit,\u201d and while that might have its implicit appeal, Berry and the rest of the cast (particularly Sharon Stone as the villain) simply flail about. Another shot at this isn\u2019t the worst idea, right?\n\n28. Batman & Robin (1997)\n\nThis was the moment when a lot of people became concerned that George Clooney wasn\u2019t going to be able to make the leap from ER hunk to actual movie star. And even now, when watching Batman & Robin, you\u2019d be forgiven for assuming that this guy doesn\u2019t seem destined to have a successful big-screen career. Indeed, the two-time Oscar winner\u2019s worst qualities are on display here \u2014 chief among them, the off-putting glib attitude meant to convey cheekiness. Batman & Robin leveled the franchise, reducing it to ash. It was Batman\u2019s low point \u2026 until Zack Snyder got his hands on him a couple of decades later.\n\n27. Suicide Squad (2016)\n\nThe year of our Lord 2016 was a nightmare for Warner Bros. creatively in terms of its DC properties. Batman v Superman was awful, while Suicide Squad was only moderately better. (Of course, both films made a ton of money, so what did the executives care?) Suicide Squad beat Venom by a couple of years on this whole \u201cWhat if a superhero movie \u2026 but bad guys?\u201d conceit, bringing together a decent cast in Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Viola Davis for a punk-rock action flick in which a group of criminals have to band together to defeat an even greater evil. Robbie has a ball letting loose as Harley Quinn, but Jared Leto\u2019s monstrously irritating performance as the Joker strips away whatever meager merits Suicide Squad has. Turns out, End of Watch director David Ayer\u2019s cynical brand of big-budget loud and stupid is just about as noxious as Snyder\u2019s.\n\n26. Jonah Hex (2010)\n\nBefore he was Thanos or even Deadpool\u2019s buddy, Josh Brolin got into the comic-book game by playing Jonah Hex, a disfigured post\u2013Civil War bounty hunter who can raise the dead, or something \u2014 it\u2019s tough to keep it all straight in animator Jimmy Hayward\u2019s muddled mess. You could maybe do a dark version of Jonah Hex in the Sin City style, and if allowed to go truly R-rated (like it might be today), you could perhaps have a supernatural Deadwood. Instead, you have this compromised, cobbled-together mishmash. Two positives: (1) the grinding, apocalyptic score from death-metal band Mastodon; (2) wow, that cast. Seriously, look at the actors in this movie: Brolin, John Malkovich, Will Arnett, Wes Bentley, Michael Shannon, and Michael Fassbender. (Oh, and also Megan Fox.)\n\n25. Supergirl (1984)\n\nBefore we get into the rest of it, Helen Slater was a perfectly passable Supergirl: She was strong and kind and good-hearted and charming in the role, and if she wasn\u2019t exactly Christopher Reeve, heck, she came close. It\u2019s a shame she has this movie surrounding her, which takes everything you liked about the first two Superman movies and runs it through a washing machine so many times that the S looks rinsed and beige. Suffice it to say, Peter O\u2019Toole, in essentially the Marlon Brando part from the first film, does not comport himself nearly as well as Brando did \u2026 and Brando wasn\u2019t that great in his entry either. (For that matter, Faye Dunaway is no Terence Stamp.) In an alternate universe, this could have been played for maximum camp and been a bit of a blast. This is not that universe.\n\n24. Green Lantern (2011)\n\nAll right, all right, we know that mocking Green Lantern has become its own cottage industry in recent years, not least of which by its star. And, yes, there\u2019s a ton of cheese here, particularly when it comes to Peter Sarsgaard\u2019s bizarrely phallic villain design. (His head is like a penis crossed with a Brussels sprout.) But seriously, not all of Green Lantern is terrible. The movie has a certain dorky good cheer that, particularly in the wake of Christopher Nolan\u2019s Batman films (and especially now that we\u2019ve seen Zack Snyder\u2019s DC films), is almost sort of welcome? Green Lantern is earnest and bright and, yeah, incredibly silly and a little embarrassing. But it also means well, and it turns out that Ryan Reynolds isn\u2019t entirely without charm in the lead role. The movie isn\u2019t good by any stretch of the imagination. But we\u2019d watch it 40 times before we\u2019d watch Batman v. Superman again.\n\n23. Constantine (2005)\n\nAnother in the long line of post-Matrix messianic, pseudo-superhero roles for Keanu Reeves, which is a big problem because the Hellblazer comic this film is based on has a lot more going on than just being a Reeves vehicle. The idea here, that a man damned to Hell for a suicide attempt in his youth exorcises demons to get back in the good graces of Heaven, has its pleasures, and you wonder if it might work as a Netflix series down the line (rather than the weak cable version we got a few years back). But this one is too rushed and too poorly thought through to reach the heights you want it to.\n\n22. Superman III (1983)\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how many times you watch it: It is never ever not surreal to see Richard Pryor show up in a Superman movie. The bummer part is that it\u2019s stunt casting top to bottom: The movie never lets Richard Pryor be anything but Richard Pryor the celebrity, rather than Richard Pryor the comic, and thus it neuters him and makes him entirely boring. Robert Vaughn is a particularly pallid villain, and the movie\u2019s case against computers, uh, hasn\u2019t aged too well. It is fun to watch Superman in a bar though. \u201cHey, look, Superman\u2019s drunk!\u201d\n\n21. Justice League (2017)\n\nA movie marred by tragedy \u2014 Zack Snyder, who had to leave mid-production because of the death of his daughter, was replaced by Joss Whedon \u2014 Justice League feels very much a collection of bits and pieces, a litany of reshoots and warring sensibilities all fighting for attention. The film\u2019s bright spot is Wonder Woman, although Gal Gadot isn\u2019t nearly as magnificent as she was in her solo film, which came out a few months earlier. Do we remember anything of the plot? Not really: Basically, a bunch of joyless dudes (and an Amazonian princess) battle Steppenwolf, who wants to enslave the universe or something. Between the half-hearted wisecracks and Henry Cavill\u2019s freaky digitally erased mustache, Justice League collapses under its own weight. This movie was meant to be DC\u2019s epochal Avengers-like moment. Instead, it was completely forgettable.\n\n20. Batman: The Killing Joke (2016)\n\nThe seminal Alan Moore comic got an animated adaptation that ended up making more news for a scene in which Batman and Barbara Gordon get it on.\n\nidk how to feel about this pic.twitter.com/gsBGHsYet5 \u2014 \u2615\ufe0f (@CupOfMiracle) July 22, 2016\n\nThat actually exacerbates a problem in the original comic, in which Barbara Gordon is sexually assaulted by the Joker\u2019s goons, but it\u2019s only taken as seriously as is required to raise the stakes for Batman. (The old \u201cfridging\u201d problem.) The movie isn\u2019t weighty enough to take on all this subtext, and it ends up making you uncomfortable in the wrong ways.\n\n19. Batman Forever (1995)\n\nThe first post\u2013Tim Burton Batman has hints of the disasters that would be coming \u2014 the bat nipples, Joel Schumacher\u2019s mostly glib, cartoonish vibe \u2014 but it never veers entirely into Mr. Freeze land. Val Kilmer cuts an excellent cowl, Nicole Kidman enjoys a rare vamping role, and even Jim Carrey carries some legitimate hellzapoppin\u2019 menace as the Riddler. The less said about Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face the better, and this was certainly a step in the wrong direction for the franchise, but it\u2019s not the fiasco its follow-up would be.\n\n18. Man of Steel (2013)\n\nThe great pity about Man of Steel is that it never lived up to its terrific theme song.\n\nConsciously moving away from John Williams\u2019s equally terrific theme for the Christopher Reeve films, Hans Zimmer gave us a sense of Superman as a mighty, courageous figure \u2014 maybe a little darker than the Man of Steel that Richard Donner had conceived in the 1970s, but still a noble, powerful force of good. Unfortunately, except for some stirring segments, Man of Steel fails to craft a story worthy of its character. Essentially re-creating Superman\u2019s origin story while inserting Superman II\u2019s bad guys, Zack Snyder\u2019s first go-round with the Kryptonian is a typically self-serious, lumbering affair. Henry Cavill is better in the role than he was given credit for at the time \u2014 nobody was going to replace Reeve in our mind \u2014 but very fine actors like Amy Adams and Michael Shannon are utterly wasted in beloved roles they fail to make their own.\n\n17. V for Vendetta (2005)\n\nIn the wake of The Matrix, Lana and Lilly Wachowski were so hot that although they only wrote and produced V for Vendetta, many assumed they directed the film as well. C\u2019mon, \u201cJames McTeigue\u201d had to be an alias, right? But no: McTeigue, an assistant director on the Matrix films, made his feature debut on this big-screen redo of the Alan Moore/David Lloyd comic. (Moore, it will not surprise you, hated the film, requesting his name be taken off the adaptation.) There\u2019s no question that the movie has a stylish, vaguely revolutionary tone \u2014 it\u2019s mildly radical for a 21st-century studio offering \u2014 and Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are sufficiently engaging as, respectively, a burgeoning insurgent and the terrorist who kidnaps her. At the same time though, V for Vendetta\u2019s politics aren\u2019t more sophisticated than \u201cHey, man, shit\u2019s fucked up,\u201d and the filmmakers\u2019 pride in their not-very-edgy stance gets awfully tiresome.\n\n16. Aquaman (2018)\n\nBecause it had a pulse \u2014 something Batman v Superman or Justice League couldn\u2019t claim \u2014 Aquaman was probably a bit overrated when it came out; critics and audiences were just so grateful not to have to suffer through another mope-fest that they\u2019d happily accept an ultragoofy underwater adventure that\u2019s part Raiders of the Lost Ark, part palace-intrigue drama. Jason Momoa makes for a pretty cheerful buff-bro Aquaman, and Furious 7 director James Wan cranks everything to 11, piling on the over-the-top imagery and spectacle until you burst out laughing or simply succumb to the whole ridiculous onslaught. Aquaman is spirited without ever being particularly good. Nevertheless, its relative high placement on this list indicates how often DC has done worse.\n\n15. Shazam! (2019)\n\nIt is an indictment of the DC Extended Universe that this likable lark is one of the best films of this newish series \u2026 and yet it\u2019s still not that great. Zachary Levi is grand fun as the adult superhero that teen orphan Billy (Asher Angel) turns into whenever he shouts \u201cShazam!\u201d Jack Dylan Grazer is a delightful sidekick. And the movie has a real sweetness and sincerity to it, determined to give family audiences a superhero flick that\u2019s not all ponderous brooding and dark origin stories. But that doesn\u2019t keep Shazam! from feeling a bit formulaic. Mark Strong\u2019s menacing villain is a bit of a drip, and the finale devolves into CG overkill. Nonetheless, director David F. Sandberg delivers a decent-enough ride for a first installment. Hopefully, the Shazam! sequel will have more of a personality and boldness.\n\n14. Return of Swamp Thing (1989) and 13. Swamp Thing (1982)\n\nWe know it\u2019s cheating a little to put these two movies together, but jeez: They\u2019re two Swamp Thing movies, and they\u2019re both roughly similar in quality, so here they are. The first one is a little more straitlaced and straightforward. Directed by Wes Craven, it\u2019s just a story of a nice guy (Ray Wise!) turned into a monster who attempts to take revenge on the evil scientist who made him that way. The movie has some spooky midnight thrills and a very game Adrienne Barbeau, but it\u2019s mostly conventional. The sequel is pretty much a comedy, which might not be true to the comic but, well, probably makes a little more sense. They both work equally well, which is \u201cjust a little.\u201d The downgrade from Barbeau to Heather Locklear in Return of Swamp Thing, however, is substantial.\n\n12. Superman Returns (2006)\n\nWhat if Superman III and Superman IV never happened? What if you just made a new movie that took place after the events of Superman II? Predating the \u201cdirect sequel\u201d phenomenon, Superman Returns revisited the openhearted spirit of the first two Superman films, casting relative unknown Brandon Routh to channel the spirit of Christopher Reeve in the dual roles of Superman and Clark Kent. Quite often, Superman Returns is a poignant homage and also a melancholy reminder that the era that birthed the original Superman movies is long gone. At its best, the film leans into that reality, giving us a story in which Clark tries to repair past mistakes he\u2019s made with Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). Ambitious, uneven, filled with feeling, Superman Returns ultimately couldn\u2019t compare to the early Reeve pictures, but the attempt is touching.\n\n11. Watchmen (2009)\n\nZack Snyder\u2019s insistence that his Watchmen movie would be so loyal to the comic that it would be nearly a shot-for-panel remake was an odd one. But considering what Snyder would do when he started adding his own special sauce to comic-book movies, maybe he should have tried this approach more often. The film doesn\u2019t have the apocalyptic menace of the graphic novel, but there\u2019s enough good stuff here that it still works; Jackie Earle Haley\u2019s Rorschach, in particular, maintains much of his furious power. The best bet remains the opening credits sequence, which portends a better movie to follow. That movie doesn\u2019t quite get there, but it still might be the best sequence Snyder\u2019s ever done.\n\n10. Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993)\n\nIt\u2019s possible that no human being has brought up this movie in conversation without thinking they\u2019re the first person to add, \u201cAnd you know, Mark Hamill is actually the best Joker.\u201d We won\u2019t go that far, but he\u2019s pretty great in Mask of the Phantasm, the big-screen version of the popular animated series of the early \u201990s. Kevin Conroy voices Bruce Wayne, who must reconcile with his past in several ways. (Dana Delany voices Andrea Beaumont, a former lover who walks back into Bruce\u2019s life.) Like the series, Mask of the Phantasm does a nice job of catering both to kids and adults \u2014 this isn\u2019t as intense as the Christopher Nolan films or as kinky as the Tim Burton movies, but it\u2019s smartly written and respectful about what makes the Dark Knight such an evergreen character. As for Hamill, he finds his own twist on the Joker\u2019s maniacal laugh and demented psyche \u2014 no easy feat, as Jared Leto could tell you.\n\n9. The Dark Knight Rises (2012)\n\nChristopher Nolan\u2019s first two Batman movies were so paradigm-shifting, so overwhelming, that it was probably impossible for this third film to match either of them. The plot\u2019s a little conventional, it\u2019s more fanboy comics-centric, and the bombast and scope sometimes outpace everything the movie has to say. (The whole Occupy Wall Street subplot feels like an empty feint.) But this is still grand blockbuster filmmaking: The scene where bombs explode across Gotham is as memorable and terrifying as anything in the series. Nolan doesn\u2019t wrap the trilogy up perfectly, but that doesn\u2019t mean The Dark Knight Rises still isn\u2019t powerful \u2026 and even fitting. He\u2019s moved on, but the rest of us still can\u2019t.\n\n8. Joker (2019)\n\nIf nothing else, Joker accomplishes something that seemed nearly impossible in the post-Nolan era: It\u2019s a DC film that actually feels relevant, inspiring debate, discussion, and controversy, which feels shocking after years during which the studio produced largely anonymous product that resided in Marvel\u2019s imposing cultural shadow. And then there\u2019s the movie itself, which actually accomplishes what it sets out to do: create a backstory for the Joker that both shows how he became such a horrifying figure and illustrates the brutality of the evil that he inspires in the world. Joaquin Phoenix is exceptional as Arthur Fleck, the troubled would-be comic who will find his calling in the most terrible of ways, and it\u2019s a performance full of jittery intensity. There\u2019s nothing about Joker that forgives or champions Joker\u2019s behavior, and while the whole movie may not be as terrific as its most inspired sequences, Phoenix and director Todd Phillips capably present a new way to think of this monster. Since we\u2019re wary of spoilers, we\u2019ll simply add that the movie presents one of the most iconic \u2014 and familiar \u2014 elements of Batman lore near the end, but the event has never been so upsetting and mournful as it is here.\n\n7. Batman (1989)\n\n\u201cThe Joker\u2019s flamboyant. Batman wants to remain in the shadows.\u201d That\u2019s how Tim Burton described the key combatants in his 1989 blockbuster, which created the template for the modern superhero film \u2014 one in which darkness, vivid production design, and moody characters would reign supreme. Michael Keaton was all icy remove, while Jack Nicholson told all his previous extreme roles to hold his beer so that he could give us a supervillain that was pure ham. Not all of Batman has held up. (Danny Elfman\u2019s score remains stirring, but genius that he was, Prince feels a little out of place on the soundtrack.) Nonetheless, Burton\u2019s grand vision of how to translate a comic-book aesthetic onto the big screen remains stunning. Other DC movies rank higher on this list, but they\u2019re all indebted to what Batman dared to dream.\n\n6. Batman Returns (1992)\n\nThe last Batman movie they\u2019d ever let Tim Burton do, and that seems to have been entirely Burton\u2019s intention. This is aggressively weird and occasionally off-putting \u2014 Danny DeVito\u2019s Penguin is just flat-out gross \u2014 which is the opposite of what Warner Bros. wanted from its sequel to one of the biggest movies of all time. But this is still when Burton had his fastball, and it\u2019s thrilling to watch him exorcise some of his personal demons on this grand of a stage. These are all misfits and outcasts back when Burton still felt that way himself, and you feel their isolation, most notably in Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s iconic Catwoman, who strikes back with furious vengeance. Batman is more beloved, but Batman Returns is arguably more memorable.\n\n5. Wonder Woman (2017)\n\nMarvel has eaten DC\u2019s lunch for years, but Warner Bros. can always hold this over its competitor\u2019s head: It made the first female-driven superhero flick of this modern superhero era that was also directed by a woman. However, those distinctions don\u2019t do justice to Wonder Woman, which made Gal Gadot a superstar, and deservedly so. Her portrayal of Diana gives this Amazonian princess the proper regal bearing, but Gadot also proves to have a wonderfully wry sense of humor as the character continues to be amazed at how weird male mortals are. Director Patty Jenkins mounts a few superb action sequences \u2014 Wonder Woman\u2019s World War I battlefield gauntlet is an all-timer \u2014 and Chris Pine is a pitch-perfect romantic foil. After Wonder Woman, moviegoers weren\u2019t necessarily clamoring for any more Superman or Batman films. We just wanted more of her.\n\n4. Superman (1978)\n\nLater in life, Christopher Reeve explained the trick to playing the Man of Steel. \u201cSuperman is a big fish in a small pond,\u201d he told Esquire. \u201cHe\u2019s Superman on Earth only because he\u2019s in a different solar system. If he\u2019d grown up on Krypton, if Krypton had not been destroyed, he might have been average \u2014 nothing special about him. That allowed me to underplay the character and make him quite casual.\u201d Among its other attributes, Superman is shot through with a winning modesty, embodied by Reeve\u2019s no-big-deal depiction of Superman. Probably no superhero movie since has articulated what a privilege it would be to find out you had incredible powers. Director Richard Donner chronicles Kal-El\u2019s origin story with awe, eventually introducing us to one of the best cinematic villains in the dastardly, smart-ass Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman). This movie could not be made now. It\u2019s too square. Too corny. Those are some of the reasons Superman remains so special.\n\n3. Batman Begins (2005)\n\nHere\u2019s where Christopher Nolan fully established that he wasn\u2019t going to be typecast as merely a crafter of clever little puzzle movies. Batman Begins resurrected the Dark Knight from the trash bin of cinematic history, erasing people\u2019s memory of the Joel Schumacher atrocities but also investing more fully in the dark perspective on the character that Tim Burton\u2019s movies merely hinted at. Christian Bale wasn\u2019t an obvious Bruce Wayne \u2014 he\u2019d previously played a very different kind of wealthy weirdo in American Psycho \u2014 but he brought the right amount of gravitas to the role so that Batman Begins wasn\u2019t less interesting when the superhero took the suit off. Add to the mix Liam Neeson as an underrated Dark Knight nemesis and you\u2019ve got one of the finest origin stories ever conceived. And, of course, Nolan was just getting started.\n\n2. Superman II (1980)\n\nIn the annals of big-budget rescue jobs, Superman II is high on the list of success stories. Initially meant to be filmed simultaneously with the first installment, the sequel faced internal battles, forcing initial director Richard Donner to be booted from the project. Enter Richard Lester, who had to take over the movie, as well as reshoot already existing material. Remarkably, Superman II shows little sign of its difficult birth. Here\u2019s where Supes declares his love for Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), who comes to discover his true identity. It\u2019s also the film that let the fearsome Zod (Terence Stamp), who was briefly shown alongside his evil chums in the 1978 original, strut his stuff. Inconceivably, Superman II is even more thrilling and stirring, not to mention touching and romantic, than its predecessor. If only Reeve and company had decided to stop there.\n\n1. The Dark Knight (2008)\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re good at something, never do it for free.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome men aren\u2019t looking for anything logical. They can\u2019t be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.\u201d\n\nBeyond being one of the most indelible of all superhero movies, The Dark Knight might also be among the most quotable. (And we haven\u2019t even mentioned the film\u2019s most iconic line, \u201cWhy so serious?\u201d) Raising the bar after the stellar Batman Begins, director Christopher Nolan dissected the very nature of heroism, evil, and sacrifice for this second installment, and in Heath Ledger we had the greatest of all Jokers \u2014 which is to say the most inexplicable and, therefore, most terrifying. Before The Dark Knight, comic-book movies were mere playthings, enjoyable but disposable entertainments. After The Dark Knight, they were held to a higher standard. After all, if Nolan could make this, there was no excuse for superhero movies not to be ambitious, nuanced, and mesmerizing. DC has stumbled often since The Dark Knight, burdened by the long shadow this film created. But no superhero movie, from any company, has ever topped it.\n\nGrierson & Leitch write about the movies regularly and host a podcast on film.
