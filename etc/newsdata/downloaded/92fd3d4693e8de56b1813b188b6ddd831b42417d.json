We are in Japan, you have to embrace their way, their culture. And most people with tattoos were happy to cover up,\u201d the New Zealand Herald quoted him as saying.\n\nSamoa\u2019s players too, have said they will hide their tattoos with skin suits when they are not playing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of similarities in our cultures but when it comes to the tattoos we have obviously got a lot of tattoos, it\u2019s quite normal in our culture,\u201d the Samoan captain, Jack Lam, told the Herald.\n\n\u201cBut we are respectful and mindful to what the Japanese way is. We will be making sure that what we are showing will be OK.\u201d\n\nTattoos are commonplace in New Zealand, especially amongst the country\u2019s M\u0101ori and Pacific Islands communities. Many All Blacks players have traditional inkings, known in M\u0101ori as T\u0101 moko.\n\nThe ban on displaying tattoos ranks alongside beer shortages as two potential sources of embarrassment at the tournament, which opens on Friday when Japan play Russia at Tokyo Stadium.\n\nBut many onsen and other facilities that usually frown on tattoos have indicated they will take a more relaxed approach, as Japan prepares for the arrival of an estimated 400,000 overseas rugby fans.\n\nTourism officials near Sapporo, which will host England v Tonga on Saturday, said they would leave individual onsen owners to decide whether to admit tattooed bathers.\n\nOita prefecture, a region of south-west Japan famed for its hot springs, published English-language guidelines on onsen etiquette and an online map of dozens of facilities in the onsen towns of Beppu and Yufuin that will accept tattooed bathers during the six-week tournament.\n\nLast September, World Rugby warned players and supporters to keep their tattoos covered when visiting gyms and pools to avoid causing offence. The guidelines will not apply to players during games, however.\n\nThe hotel near Tokyo where the All Blacks are staying at while they prepare for their opening match against South Africa in Yokohama on Saturday is happy for the players to show off tattoos on their arms and legs.\n\n\u201cIt was only this hotel (that) don\u2019t mind,\u201d Smith said, according to Stuff.co.nz. \u201cEvery hotel we go to, we get a little message around that.\u201d\n\nThe players have also had to adapt to the Japanese custom of not wearing shoes inside homes and some other buildings.\n\n\u201cThe only other thing that is similar around the hotel is shoes,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe gym we go to today, we have got to take indoor shoes. The ones you walk to the gym in, you can\u2019t wear in the gym.\n\n\u201cWe just have to respect that and adapt as All Blacks. We are grateful to be here and we don\u2019t want to act anything bigger than we are.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Angela Cuming", "description": "With body ink associated with yakuza gangsters, New Zealand\u2019s Rugby World Cup stars are happy to hide their artwork", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ecf768006b6e2e1e24c6517bdd392a5a3366e54/0_92_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dda15cc0c62cd16a6d3d67da5f15fb67", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
