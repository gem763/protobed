Nearly three years later, slabs of rock form a slash in the landscape just beyond the graves.\n\n\"Because of climate change and the difference that makes to the soil and the ground, some of the graves that we see behind us might end up actually sliding into the road,\" says Smedsroed, whose gray hair matches the woolen sweater beneath his white collar. \"Or the next thing that we could see is that they might all be covered in the next big landslide coming down the hill.\"", "description": "Icebergs float like doomed islands past the small boat as it makes its way through a fjord filled with the slush of a melting glacier.
