At the time, the CDC had confirmed 530 probable cases of people who have experienced lung injuries associated with the use of e-cigarettes or vape products.\n\nABC News' Erin Schumaker contributed to this story.", "description": "Walgreens and Kroger will no longer sell e-cigarettes amid growing concern over vaping.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/vape-01-as-gty-190920_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
