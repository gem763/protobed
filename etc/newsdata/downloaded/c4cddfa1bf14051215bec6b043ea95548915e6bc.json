Impeachment proceedings would then move to the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe filing directs the House committees \u201cto continue their ongoing investigations as part of the existing House of Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House \u2026 to exercise its Constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America, and for other purposes.\u201d\n\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and Oversight Committee Chairwoman Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) released a statement Tuesday on the resolution. The statement said the resolution \u201cprovides rules for the format of open hearings in the House Intelligence Committee, including staff-led questioning of witnesses, and it authorizes the public release of deposition transcripts.\u201d\n\nSTATEMENT from Intel, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs and Oversight Chairs:\n\n\n\nThe House impeachment inquiry has collected extensive evidence and testimony. In the next phase, the American people will learn firsthand about the President\u2019s misconduct.https://t.co/XSSJUaa6KF \u2014 House Intelligence Committee (@HouseIntel) October 29, 2019\n\nThe resolution also establishes proper procedures for handing over evidence to the Judiciary Committee, which is responsible for putting together articles of impeachment. It also sets forth Trump\u2019s due process rights in the Judiciary Committee proceedings.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said Tuesday that the resolution is a \u201cscam\u201d and \u201cdoes nothing to change the fundamental fact that House Democrats refuse to provide basic due process rights to the Administration,\u201d despite the resolution outlining due process rights for the administration.\n\nUnder the rules, according to a Democratic summary, Trump\u2019s attorneys would have the chance to participate in the hearings once they move to the House Judiciary Committee. The full House Judiciary Committee rules are not publicly available, but Democrats said Trump or his attorneys would be able to \u201cpresent their case and respond to evidence; submit written requests for additional testimony or other evidence; attend hearings, including those held in executive session; raise an objection to testimony given; and cross-examine witnesses.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats warned that Rep. Nadler, as chairman, could deny requests from the president or his counsel if Trump \u201cunlawfully refuses to cooperate with Congressional requests.\u201d\n\nThe plan also calls for staff attorneys to take the lead during hearings, with both Republican and Democratic attorneys questioning witnesses for 45 minutes each. Only after the staff questioning will members of Congress (other than the chair and ranking members) get their turn to question witnesses.\n\nThe proposal will make Trump supporter Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) the face of Trump\u2019s defense. Only Nunes and Schiff \u2015 or a Permanent Select Committee employee they designate \u2015 will control the time for the first 90 minutes.\n\n\u201cThese hearings will look entirely different from the ones you are used to,\u201d tweeted Matthew Miller, a former Justice Department spokesman. \u201cThe House already has the proof, now it needs to move public opinion. This is how you construct hearings that can do that. Kudos to House Intel members for sacrificing ego to make this happen.\u201d\n\nThe House already has the proof, now it needs to move public opinion.

Steve Scalise (R-La.) said Tuesday that lawmakers should vote against the resolution, which he said \u201creaffirms and builds upon that tainted process by using the biased evidence obtained as the foundation for impeachment.\u201d He also called the investigation a \u201cSoviet-style impeachment inquiry\u201d without providing further context into the description.\n\nScalise and Jordan are holding a press availability outside the SCIF condemning the \"Soviet-style\" process of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\n\n\"This isnt like Benghazi, this isn't like anything else,\" Scalise says. pic.twitter.com/JVMGuz63mq \u2014 Grace Segers (@Grace_Segers) October 29, 2019\n\nThe House launched its impeachment inquiry after a bombshell whistleblower complaint alleged Trump was abusing the power of his office by pressuring foreign governments, specifically Ukraine, to interfere in U.S. elections.\n\nIn July, Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to ask his counterpart to investigate political rival Joe Biden. Trump was withholding congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine at the time, and testimonies from involved U.S. diplomats reveal that the decision was an attempted quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cThe evidence we have already collected paints the picture of a President who abused his power by using multiple levers of government to press a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election,\u201d the chairs said in their Tuesday statement. \u201cFollowing in the footsteps of previous impeachment inquiries, the next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings where the American people will learn firsthand about the President\u2019s misconduct.\u201d\n\nRead the resolution below:\n\nIgor Bobic contributed to this report.", "description": "The House filed a resolution that would authorize the House Intelligence Committee to have public hearings on the impeachment investigation.", "authors": ["Reporter", "Senior Justice Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db88f502000005832507245.jpeg?cache=0peus3sbu0&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
