The issue is are they used in practice, and is there actually downside when things go wrong.\"\n\nOther large companies are holding annual meetings this week. On Tuesday, Telstra director Craig Dunn is expected to face pressure given his previous role leading AMP. On Wednesday, Origin could face questions after activist group Market Forces called for its coal power station to be closed two years early.\n\nMarket Forces last week also stepped up pressure on Westpac, ANZ and National Australia Bank \u2013 which are facing second strikes at their annual general meetings later in the year \u2013 over lending to the coal sector.\n\n'They read the room'\n\nBut the group will not be agitating against CBA after Ms Livingstone met with its executive director. The bank subsequently announced it would cease all lending to thermal coal mining and coal-fired power stations by 2030.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving fended off the activists, Ms Livingstone was thoroughly prepared when addressing remuneration accountability concerns over the past month according to two CBA shareholders who met with her.\n\n\"Catherine was across all the details, she took us through the board risk committee processes and had all the data points going to the heart of issues,\u201d said one. Another said: \u201cThey\u2019ve read the room, and credit to them.\"\n\nInstitutional Shareholder Services (ISS), CGI Glass Lewis, Ownership Matters and ACSI are all understood to be advising votes in favour of the CBA remuneration report. Investors have also applauded the move to reduce short-term bonuses by 10 per cent as the bank continues to mop up after the damning APRA prudential inquiry and royal commission.\n\n\u201cAll group executives experienced a reduction in their variable remuneration due to shareholder and customer outcomes, including as a consequence of the impact of customer remediation provisions on this year\u2019s financial performance,\u201d Ms Livingstone, who was paid $880,000 by CBA in the past year, told shareholders in a letter sent out ahead of the AGM.\n\nBefore CBA was hit with an historic 'first strike' at its AGM in 2016, the bank would almost always award all senior executives their full bonuses, regardless of whether problems had emerged during the year. For example, in the five financial years between 2012 and 2016, only four senior executives were paid below target, and the lowest of those was 94 per cent.\n\nShareholders want to see the newfound variability continue.\n\n\u201cSince 2016 the CBA board has demonstrated a significant degree of discipline in awarding [short term bonus] outcomes and this has continued into 2019,\u201d said proxy advisory firm CGI Glass Lewis.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by this discipline and hope to see variable pay being used as a mechanism to hold executives accountable in the future, in particular, beyond the current period of heightened scrutiny of Australia's financial services sector stemming from the royal commission.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShifting criteria\n\nAfter APRA chairman Wayne Byres last week warned banks to suggest new models for pay, CBA has made a big shift towards non-financial metrics, and is already near APRA's proposal for financial performance measures to not comprise more than 50 per cent of performance criteria for variable remuneration outcomes.\n\nISS noted CBA had halved the proportion of executive short-term variable remuneration based on financial measures from 60 per cent to 30 per cent, a turnaround it described as \"remarkable\". The maximum variable remuneration outcomes for the CEO and most group executives are weighted at 55 per cent for financial measures and 45 per cent for non-financial measures. The shift comes after the Hayne royal commission found too much focus on financial measures were a cause of misconduct.\n\n\u201cLong-term investors support the inclusion of non-financial measures for executive remuneration. Like financial measures, they must be based on objective, transparent and measurable targets and be truly at-risk,\" Ms Davison said.\n\nYet some have raised concerns CBA's new short-term measures relate to efforts to fix the risk and governance failures of prior years. ISS said the \"heavy emphasis on strategy is of concern to shareholders, as it appears to be rewarding the CEO and senior executives for fixing and attending to risk and governance issues that were identified in the royal commission and by the regulator, APRA\".\n\n\u201cWhile this is necessary, shareholders may question the judgement of the board's knee-jerk reaction to reverse the emphasis away from financial to what many may consider to be non-financial 'day job' measures,\" ISS said.\n\nDavid Higgins, chair of the CBA board 'people and remuneration committee' \u2013 who will be retiring from the board on Wednesday \u2013 said the bank will continue to \"monitor and adjust our remuneration policy and frameworks for all employees so they continue to meet both the spirit and the requirement of revised regulatory standards and reflect evolving community expectations\".\n\nAPRA is planning on releasing its new prudential standard CPS 511 on remuneration before the end of the year, with a three-month consultation period set to close on October 23.\n\nAPRA deputy chair John Lonsdale has said \u201cremuneration and accountability frameworks play an important role in driving employee behaviour\" and \"where policies are poorly designed, or not followed in practice, companies may incentivise conduct that is contrary to the long-term interests of the company and its customers.\"", "description": "At its AGM on Wednesday, CBA's remuneration report is likely to win support after the bank curtailed the short-term bonuses of 14 senior executives.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4251%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_9%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2b7404b95ad4346de531965ccc5ad3dce5cb7fef", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
