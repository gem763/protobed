And as three East Coast tech reporters, we were probably the easiest targets for the show\u2019s many charms.\n\nStill, we felt like we had to talk about it. In fact, our \u201cSuccession\u201d review on this episode of the Original Content podcast is perhaps our most epic discussion so far. And we probably would have gone for even longer, if we thought anyone would still be listening.\n\nThe series revolves around the Roy family, whose patriarch Logan Roy (played by Brian Cox) founded and still leads the Waystar Royco media empire. Throughout the course of the two seasons, his four children \u2014 heir apparent Kendall (Jeremy Strong), political fixer Shiv (Sarah Snook), snarky smart aleck Roman (Kieran Culkin) and libertarian weirdo Connor (Alan Ruck) \u2014 all take turns vying for their father\u2019s attention and scheming against him.\n\nAll three of us loved \u201cSuccession,\u201d but even without a long argument about the show\u2019s merits, there was still plenty for us to debate: How a story with such morally bankrupt characters can still be so compelling, to what extend those characters are motivated by love versus hate versus greed (and whether they can even tell the difference) and who, in the end, deserves to sit on the corporate throne.\n\nWe also discuss next week\u2019s launch of Disney+ and Apple TV+, and which shows we\u2019re most excited about finally watching.\n\nYou can listen in the player below, subscribe using Apple Podcasts or find us in your podcast player of choice.
