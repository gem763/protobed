The Louvre prepares to open blockbuster Da Vinci show", "language": "en", "text": "The world's most expensive painting ever sold at auction may never go on display at the Louvre's new blockbuster exhibition over doubts of its whereabouts.\n\nSalvator Mundi, a depiction of Christ as saviour of the world, was painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the early 1500s - although whether it is truly his work is a hotly contested topic.\n\nThe painting - which sold for a record breaking $450million in New York in 2017 - was due to appear in the world's biggest collection of da Vinci in the Paris museum.\n\nBut with just under two weeks to go before the show opens, there are now doubts over whether the painting will appear after it controversially went 'missing'.\n\nSalvator Mundi, a depiction of Christ as saviour of the world, was painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the early 1500s - although whether it is truly his work is a hotly contested topic\n\nIt has since been claimed the canvas will make a no-show due to it's loan not yet being approved, according to The Art Newspaper.\n\nMeanwhile, a Louvre spokesperson told the Observer they had 'asked for the loan' of the painting but did not 'have the answer yet'.\n\nThe absence of the painting from the exhibition - which celebrates the 500th anniversary of the death of da Vinci - is likely to cast doubts over its exact whereabouts.\n\nIn 2017, an Abu Dahbi Prince, Badr bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan Al Saud, bought the work of art for $450million.\n\nThe painting - which sold for a record breaking $450million in New York in 2017 - was due to appear in the world's biggest collection of da Vinci in the Paris museum\n\nIt is unclear whether the painting was or was not done by Leonardo da Vinci, who is seen here in a portrait by Lattanzio Querena\n\nMany at the time believed the Prince was acting on behalf of an even more senior member of the royal family: Mohammed Bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, de facto ruler of the kingdom and arguably the most powerful man in the Middle East.\n\nTIMELINE OF THE SALVATOR MUNDI 1506 - 1513 - The experts who authenticated Salvator Mundi suggest it was painted between 1506 and 1513 for Louis XII of France. 1609 - 1669 - The original painting passed from King Louis XII by descent to Queen Henrietta Maria of France (1609-1669), wife of Charles I. 1651 - After Charles I was executed in 1649, the painting was sold in 1651, before being retrieved by his son, Charles II, in 1660. It was then removed from James II\u2019s collection by the Countess of Dorchester, and passed through the hands of several aristocratic owners, including Sir Charles Sheffield, 1st Baronet, an ancestor of Samantha Cameron. 1763 \u2013 After remaining in the Royal family\u2019s collection for years, the painting goes missing\u2014and doesn\u2019t surface until it was sold to Sir Charles Robinson for a mere \u00a32.10. 1900s \u2013 Proper documentation only goes back as far as 1900, when it was sold to a British collector, Sir Francis Cook. 1958 - It was Cook\u2019s descendant, also Sir Francis Cook, who sold the picture for \u00a345 in 1958. 2005 - The canvas surfaces again at an American estate sale. New York art dealer Alexander Parish purchases it for another bargain price of $10,000. 2008 - Parrish sought its authentication as a Leonardo which was confirmed. 2013 - It was sold to Swiss dealer Yves Bouvier for \u00a358 million. 2017 - A Russian, Dmitry Rybolovlev, bought it for \u00a3100 million before Christie\u2019s achieved the record price of $450million in 2017.\n\nIt was rumoured the painting hung on his super-yacht and was due to be unveiled at the new Louvre Abu Dhabi in September.\n\nThe museum of art and civilisation, which is said to have cost around one billion euros \u2014 including 400 million euros to carry the \u2018Louvre\u2019 name \u2014 opened last year, and the Leonardo was to have had pride of place.\n\nBut the unveiling was suddenly cancelled, with no explanation. The painting seemingly went missing.\n\nNow it is claimed by French art experts that plans to include Salvator Mundi at the landmark exhibition at the Louvre in Paris in just two weeks may be on hold because of further doubts over its origins.\n\nSixty years ago it swapped hands for \u00a345 as an undistinguished work in a job lot of Old Masters which had been collected by an English baronet.\n\nIn 2005, New York art dealers Alexander Parrish and Robert Simon bought it for $10,000 at a Louisiana estate sale.\n\nMr Parrish and a consortium he assembled then paid for it to be restored, with the work carried out by a leading figure in the art world, Dianne Dwyer Modestini, from New York University's Conservation Center of the Institute of Fine Arts.\n\nPre-restoration photographs show great white streaks running down the picture, and Christ with large patches of paint missing from his hair, chin, nose, forehead and left eye socket.\n\nParrish sought its authentication as a Leonardo, which was confirmed in 2008, before selling it in 2013 to Swiss dealer Yves Bouvier for \u00a358 million.\n\nA Russian, Dmitry Rybolovlev, bought it for \u00a3100 million before Christie\u2019s achieved the record price in 2017.\n\nBut questions still remain as to the painting's provenance.\n\nFew of the doubters think Salvator Mundi is a modern fake. The original picture was almost certainly painted in Leonardo's lifetime (1452-1519).\n\nPrince Mohammed bin Salman is rumoured to be the 'Saudi prince' who bought the Salvator Mundi painting in 2017 for a world-record $450.3million in New York\n\nExperts say the pigments of the oil paints are the same as those used by Leonardo. And it was painted on a walnut wood panel \u2014 a surface he favoured.\n\nBut those doubters think it may be a 'workshop Leonardo': that is to say, it was painted in his studio but by one of his assistants.\n\nAt best, the master may have added the odd detail, they say, but it certainly isn't an 'autograph' painting \u2014 all Leonardo's own work \u2014 and therefore the mammoth price tag isn't justified.\n\nA Saudi prince bidding by phone bought the picture for $450m including fees, but it is believed he was acting on behalf of the Crown Prince\n\nMost damning may be a recent article which quoted the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Carmen Bambach saying she was wrongly referenced in Christie's catalogue as attributing the painting to the artist alone.\n\nIn fact Bambach stated that the work was mostly painted by 'Leonardo's assistant, Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio.'\n\nMatthew Landrus, a Leonardo expert at Oxford University, suggests Salvatore Mundi is the work of da Vinci's assistant Bernardino Luini.\n\nAnd a French expert, Jacques Franck, alleges that Louvre staff 'know that the Salvator Mundi isn't a Leonardo'.", "description": "The painting (pictured) - which sold for a record breaking  $450million in New York in 2017 - was due to appear in the world's biggest collection of da Vinci in the Paris museum.", "authors": ["Sophie Law For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/12/19652726-0-image-a-6_1570965698336.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
