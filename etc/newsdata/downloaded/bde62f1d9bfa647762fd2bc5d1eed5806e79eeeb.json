Facebook used the word when rejecting ads that featured people who were overweight or had skin conditions, and it kept removing ads placed by body positivity communities. The company maintains that moderators were never instructed to strike down ads depicting people as \u201cundesirable,\u201d but it\u2019s since updated its language to remove the word from the rejection messages potential platform advertisers receive.\n\nConcern over the wording was piqued last month after rosacea activist and beauty blogger Lex Gillies tried to run an ad on Instagram that featured her face and her skin as the focus, celebrating the difference rather than painting it as a flaw that needed to be fixed. After first submitting her ad for approval, she received a pop-up notification in the Instagram app that said, \u201cThis ad isn\u2019t running because it uses images that excessively focus on a person\u2019s body or body part, or depict unlikely before-and-after results.\u201d\n\nGillies continued to appeal Facebook\u2019s decision, and after a handful of follow-up emails, she was told that the platform doesn\u2019t \u201callow ads that focus on aspects of a person\u2019s body to highlight an undesirable or idealized body state.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until The Verge reached out to Instagram last month that the platform apologized and decided to run Gillies\u2019 ad.\n\nThe word \u201cundesirable\u201d drew ire from Gillies and the skin positivity community in which she participates, an online world that celebrates conditions like eczema and rosacea. From there, Gillies inspired the use of the hashtag #UndesirablesofInstagram. As of publication, the hashtag has over 500 posts on Instagram that show users documenting their skin acceptance journeys and calling on Facebook to change the policy.\n\nThe policy that kept Gillies\u2019 ad from running is, in theory, meant to block predatory ads that market miracle cures and supplements for weight loss and health conditions. But the policy has repeatedly blocked ads from individuals seeking to highlight these same conditions in a positive light. This policy is still broadly in place after this change, but Facebook is making changes to account for the harmful language it uses.\n\n\u201cI am so pleased that Instagram did the right thing. I never wanted Instagram to be \u2018cancelled\u2019 or for people to boycott the channel,\u201d Gillies said in a blog post in Refinery 29 on Thursday. \u201cI just wanted the outdated and hurtful guidelines to be changed.\u201d", "description": "The change comes after reporting from The Verge and continued pressure from Facebook and Instagram\u2019s body and skin positivity regarding the issue.
