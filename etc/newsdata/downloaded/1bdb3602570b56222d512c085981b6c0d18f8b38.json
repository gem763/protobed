This has happened.\n\n\u201cI must say that the players in the last 24 hours have really stepped up and they have been incredibly responsible and resilient, and sometimes that brings teams closer together.\n\n\u201cWe have got to draw a line in the sand on this, and really focus on preparing the team for the next five days.\n\n\u201cWe got a shock the other day, like I said, and it took a bit of time for it to sink in.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say anything that potentially jeopardises the investigation, and we are pretty aware of that. There was concern by the coaches and the players about Rob and the welfare of Rob.\u201d\n\nFormer Wales fly-half Stephen Jones, who was due to succeed Howley as attack specialist after the tournament, is flying out to join the squad in Kitakyushu ahead of Wales\u2019 World Cup opener against Georgia.\n\nWales star Dan Biggar was one of the players to speak out as he revealed that he and his teammates had been left \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the controversy.\n\n\u201cEspecially for people like myself and Jon (centre Jonathan Davies), who have only ever had Rob as coach in the set-up and he has given us every single cap we\u2019ve had,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge disappointment, really, and shock, I suppose, but we are also adults and realise if things like this happen then we have just got to get on with it.\u201d\n\nBiggar added that the Welsh squad wouldn\u2019t let the affair destabilise their efforts to lift the Webb Ellis Cup in November.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what has been great about this squad over the last year or two is that whatever has come our way \u2013 we had a couple of distractions in the last Six Nations and we went on to win our final two games and the Grand Slam \u2013 we are strong.\n\n\u201cWe have got lots of strong characters in the squad, and hopefully that will stand us in good stead for the next five or six weeks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we need a huge amount more galvanising than the prize that is at stake on November 2 (World Cup final day). That is the main aim of all of us coming here, and it still remains the same.\u201d", "description": "Warren Gatland and his Welsh players have expressed their \u201cshock\u201d and \u201cdisappointment\u201d after assistant coach Rob Howley was sent home from the World Cup for an alleged betting and anti-corruption breach.
