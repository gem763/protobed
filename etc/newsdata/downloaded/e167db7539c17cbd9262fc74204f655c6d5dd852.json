The magazine referred to the transactions as \u201cTrump Chaos Trades.\u201d\n\nSince the story\u2019s publication, the suggestion that White House leaks could be a factor in futures traders making billions of dollars from well-timed bets ahead of major geopolitical announcements has fueled endless chatter from Washington to Wall Street. Still, the article has been met with widespread skepticism from the financial industry.\n\nCME Group Inc., the world\u2019s biggest futures exchange, has dismissed the claims, arguing that the trades highlighted in the story couldn\u2019t have been based on inside information because too many market participants were involved. The article describes five big transactions in S&P 500 e-mini futures from June 28 to Sept. 13, ranging from 55,000 to 420,000 contracts.\n\n\u201cAs it relates to the Vanity Fair article published on October 17, 2019, regarding activities in the E-mini S&P futures contract, the allegations about the trading activity are patently false,\u201d CME said in an Oct. 18 statement.\n\nIn Monday\u2019s letter, Democrats said they wanted federal authorities \u201cto investigate immediately whether any rules, laws or regulations were violated.\u201d The lawmakers added that \u201cif any wrongdoing is uncovered, we demand that you swiftly hold violators accountable to the fullest extent possible.\u201d\n\nSpokesmen for the SEC and Justice Department declined to comment, while spokesmen for the FBI and CFTC didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe wagers cited by Vanity Fair were made shortly before market-moving news -- three times involving the U.S.-China trade war, once involving the bombing of Saudi oil fields and once involving Hong Kong politics. Thanks to market reactions, the magazine said, people involved in the transactions could\u2019ve booked gains of between $82.5 million on the smallest to $1.8 billion on the biggest.\n\nThe story\u2019s author, William D. Cohan, has said that finance professionals with decades of experience alerted him to the trades. Cohan, a former Bloomberg Opinion columnist, has said that factors other than illegal buying-and-selling could explain the transactions and that he doesn\u2019t know whether any nefarious activity actually occurred.\n\nEarlier Monday, Angus King, an independent Maine senator who caucuses with the Democrats, also called on the SEC to investigate. Last week, Democratic Representatives Ted Lieu and Kathleen Rice requested a federal investigation into the timing around sales of e-mini futures contracts before significant geopolitical events or statements from Trump.\n\n--With assistance from Nick Baker.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Ben Bain in Washington at bbain2@bloomberg.net;Matt Robinson in New York at mrobinson55@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jesse Westbrook at jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net, Gregory Mott\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Democratic lawmakers are increasingly demanding that U.S. authorities investigate allegations raised in a recent magazine article that traders might be using non-public government information to reap huge illegal profits, even as the exchange where the transactions purportedly took place", "authors": ["Ben Bain", "Matt Robinson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
