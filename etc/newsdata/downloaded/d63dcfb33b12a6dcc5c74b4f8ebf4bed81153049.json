But he acknowledged that the force was getting \u201ca lot of engagement\u201d from Vietnamese people who believed loved ones had been in the trailer.\n\nVietnam\u2019s foreign ministry said at the weekend that its embassy officials had been in touch with the Home Office and police over the investigation and that they were working jointly to identify the dead. The Vietnamese ambassador visited the scene of the tragedy on Saturday.\n\nEssex Police had initially said that it believed all the 31 men and eight women found dead were Chinese nationals. But it distanced itself from that position on Saturday (AEDT) after widespread reporting of texts from Pham Thi Tra My, a 26-year-old woman from Vietnam, reporting to her family that she was suffocating in a container.\n\nVN Express International, a state-owned media outlet, on Saturday reported that 12 more families from Ha Tinh and Nghe An provinces, both in central Vietnam, feared family members had died in the trailer.\n\nDCI Pasmore also said he had met a \u201cfacilitator\u201d \u2014 apparently a representative of the VietHome website used by the UK\u2019s Vietnamese community \u2014 to ask them to put out an appeal for Vietnamese people to make contact. VietHome said that it had forwarded to the police 20 pictures supplied by Vietnamese people in the UK and Vietnam of people that were feared to have been in the trailer.\n\n\u201cI met him [to ask people to] take that leap of faith and please make contact with our team,\u201d DCI Pasmore said of the meeting.\n\nDCI Pasmore said that Essex Police would take no action against anyone who lacked legal immigration status who contacted the force to report concerns about loved ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs well as the driver and the man arrested on Saturday, three other people remain under arrest on suspicion of involvement in the deaths. All three are being held on suspicion of conspiracy to smuggle people and manslaughter.\n\nThe UK has a substantial Vietnamese community, many of whom arrived in the UK after reaching Hong Kong \u2014 then a British territory \u2014 as \u201cboat people\u201d from Vietnam in the late 1970s. Groups working on labour abuse and people trafficking report encountering large numbers of Vietnamese people working in poor conditions, particularly in illegal cannabis factories and businesses such as nail bars.\n\nWednesday\u2019s discovery is the worst mass death of migrants in the UK since 58 Chinese migrants were found suffocated to death in the back of a truck near Dover in 2000.\n\nDCI Pasmore said that all the bodies had been removed from the trailer by Saturday afternoon and that autopsies were under way at a hospital in Chelmsford.\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "Police at the weekend charged the driver of the truck in which 39 bodies were found in an industrial park earlier in the week with manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.43%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_445%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8890c5a48429907979b6214fc853071570f34c83", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
