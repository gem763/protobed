It'll be the first time that \u2018Yastrzemski' will be announced on the field since '83.\"\n\nMike's had a long and winding road to the big leagues. He was drafted three different times, including by the Red Sox out of high school in 2009, but didn't sign until the Baltimore Orioles took him in 2013.\n\nAfter six years in the Orioles' system, Mike was dealt to San Francisco in March. The Massachusetts native made his MLB debut in May at the age of 28. He's been a pleasant surprise for the Giants with a .265/.324/.509 slash line and 20 homers after Tuesday's blast.", "description": "It's only fitting that the grandson of Boston Red Sox icon Carl Yastrzemski hit a home run in his first career game at Fenway Park...", "authors": ["Adam Wells"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/828/688/hi-res-3b9bac25a27bcb2b1d2cd5d70f5f9123_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
