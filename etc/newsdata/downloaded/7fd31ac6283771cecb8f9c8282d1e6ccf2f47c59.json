USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Houston, the Washington Nationals have a problem, and it\u2019s you.\n\nOr perhaps it\u2019s them.\n\nSomething is wrong, and whether it\u2019s the Nationals\u2019 sudden lack of hitting or the Astros\u2019 suddenly phenomenal pitching, Washington has squandered a 2-0 World Series lead, giving up every ounce of momentum it worked so hard to achieve just three days ago.\n\nThe October Washington Nationals, unbeatable over eight straight postseason games until Friday, have now reverted to the April and May Nationals, the team that stumbled out of the blocks to a 19-31 start before coming on like gangbusters over the summer to qualify for the wild card and earn an improbable spot in the World Series.\n\nNo statistic tells the tale of the Nationals\u2019 jarring woes better than this: in Games 3 and 4 at Nationals Park, the Nats have had a whopping 19 runners in scoring position.\n\nOnly one of them has crossed the plate.\n\nIn all, the Nationals have managed just two runs in 18 innings: Friday\u2019s 4-1 loss and Saturday\u2019s 8-1 drubbing. They look either flummoxed or over-eager at the plate, or both. The mature and energized Washington hitters of the National League Championship Series and the first two games of this World Series have disappeared.\n\nNationals starting pitcher Patrick Corbin looks down at the rubber.

Or are the Astros now unstoppable, even though the Series is still tied, 2-2, with all four games having been won by the team on the road?\n\nNationals manager Dave Martinez chose optimism. \u201cNow it\u2019s best two out of three,\u201d he said, uttering what became the key talking point in both clubhouses late Saturday night into early Sunday morning.\n\nICE COLD: Nats' offense silent as World Series lead vanishes\n\nCALL TO THE PEN: Nats manager on bullpen: 'You don't chase wins'\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t hit the last couple of days,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI have confidence we\u2019ll bounce back and be ready to play tomorrow. It\u2019s just one of those things, it\u2019s baseball. I told the boys, we\u2019re in the World Series, we\u2019re going to play Game 5, it\u2019s tied 2-2, who would have thought that in the beginning?\u201d\n\nAs for the anemic hitting, the spotty pitching and the missed opportunity to put the Series away in front of a crowd that was ready to explode?\n\n\u201cForget about it,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do nothing about the last two games. Let\u2019s look ahead and get ready to play tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHis message was directed at his entire team, but if there\u2019s someone who really needs to take those words to heart, it\u2019s young Juan Soto, who has gone 0-for-7 in Games 3 and 4, fooled by Houston\u2019s pitchers and his own impatience.\n\nMartinez said he has spoken with Soto.\n\n\u201cI just want him to understand he\u2019s really good when he stays in the middle of the field\u2026and takes his walks. That\u2019s the key to him. Don\u2019t try to do too much.\u201d\n\nEvery Nationals player who chatted with a reporter after Game 4 struck the same theme.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what we\u2019ve dealt with all year, getting punched in the face and coming back,\u201d said right fielder Adam Eaton. \u201cSometimes you need to get punched in the face in order to get back in the fight.\u201d\n\nThe best reason for hope for the Nationals is that their two top pitchers, Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg -- the men who beat the Astros in Houston -- will be pitching in Games 5 and 6.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to erase what\u2019s happened the last two days,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two really good pitchers the next two days, which gives us a lot of confidence.\"\n\nSaid teammate Anthony Rendon: \u201cThe series is back at zero. It\u2019s a race to two wins and we\u2019re going to try to treat it like it\u2019s a regular-season series and try to win two of three.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe guys get it,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cIt\u2019s been preached all year long: Let\u2019s just worry about the here and now and worry about going 1-0 tomorrow. Let\u2019s go with that.\u201d\n\nOn a night when the joy in a packed stadium excited as quickly as many of the fans did, that was as good a thought as any.", "description": "As for the Nationals' anemic hitting, the spotty pitching and the missed opportunity to put the Series away, it's now a best-of-three series.", "authors": ["Christine Brennan", "Published A.M.
