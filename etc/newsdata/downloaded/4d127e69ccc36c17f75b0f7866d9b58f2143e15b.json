He played as an 18-year-old boy for Schalke in the Bundesliga.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strong league and he played there, and was always a standout player, a fixed point in defence.\n\n\u201cYes he lacked a little bit of consistency, that can happen especially with his physical stature.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t always look sensational when he moves. But he grew and developed. Joel is in a really good moment; long, long may it continue.\u201d\n\nMatip will start against Sheffield United on Saturday, keeping Joe Gomez and Dejan Lovren out of the side again, having put together an impressive run of form.\n\nHe has partnered Van Dijk in central defence for every match since January 19 bar four games last season and just the Community Shield and European Super Cup final this campaign.\n\nThe 28-year-old had a clause in his contract triggered earlier this month which ties him to the club until 2021.\n\nKlopp is also keen to keep the veteran in his squad James Milner, who turns 34 in January, for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe midfielder, who played a key role in Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup win over MK Dons with a goal and an assist, is in the final eight months of his contract but his manager believes there is plenty of life left in the player yet.\n\n\u201cMilly is unbelievably important. He is Mr Professional, that\u2019s how it is. He\u2019s very serious in all the things he does, but very funny in the dressing room,\u201d added the Reds boss.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a role model for the young boys. Not only the young boys actually. He\u2019s had an exceptional career so far and he looks like he has a few more years in the locker.\n\n\u201cContract situations, we don\u2019t talk about here. But we are really happy to have him.\u201d\n\nKlopp was also happy with the current injury situation with goalkeeper Alisson Becker expected to make his long-awaited return to first-team training on Sunday.\n\nThe Brazil international has been sidelined with a calf injury since the opening match of the season on August 9.\n\n\u201cAlisson looks like he is close, but the final word is with the medical department,\u201d said manager Jurgen Klopp.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not in contention for tomorrow. Maybe he can train with the team from Sunday on. Really close.\n\n\u201cAlisson\u2019s injury was serious but in the last two weeks he progressed really really well.\u201d\n\nSadio Mane has fully recovered from a dead leg sustained in last weekend\u2019s win at Chelsea while fellow forward Divock Origi has returned after missing three matches with an ankle injury, although midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri, who injured a calf in training on Monday, is not fit.", "description": "Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has hailed unsung hero Joel Matip as one of the best signings he has made.
