Effectively they are down the path of rate cutting for quite some time.\u201d\n\nDespite the expected rate cuts this year, Memani said not all of the voting members of the central bank may be on board.\n\n\u201cThere is a significant amount of resistance from the regional Fed presidents... in all of these pockets, those Fed presidents think the economy is in good enough shape, and we don\u2019t need anything, but I think if the Fed doesn\u2019t cut, the dollar strengthens,\u201d Memani said. \u201cThe strengthening of the dollar is probably something that is going to be very bad for the U.S. economy. So, they have no choice, I think despite the resistance from three or four presidents, we are probably going to see a cut in September, maybe in October and maybe one in December.\u201d\n\nU.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney chat during the three-day \"Challenges for Monetary Policy\" conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, U.S., August 23, 2019.

They are in the process of unwinding that, but that process will take some time,\u201d Memani said. \u201cFor the yield curve to get its normal shape they\u2019ll probably have to cut four or five times before the yield curve steepens up again. That\u2019s not gonna happen, so get used to the idea that the curve is going to get inverted.\u201d\n\nKenneth Underwood is a senior producer for Yahoo Finance.
