This is the man that killed my dad.\"\n\nAfter ripping down the 'Brigade Boys' flag, Jay grabbed hold of Callum when he protested.\n\nJay added: \"That man stabbed my dad and watched him die. No gold rings, no watches, no banners, no whisky, no 200 people clapping him anywhere.\n\n\"So don\u2019t tell me what I can and can\u2019t do, alright?\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nJay downed a bottle of whisky while sitting on the bench where he scratched his dad's name into over a decade ago.\n\nLola told him to let it go, but Jay realised he had not got justice for Jase's death if 200 people were clapping Terry off.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben tried to let down Terry's wife but she issues a threat to ruin the funeral business.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nJay made a surprise return and agreed to arrange the funeral, but was secretly planning a revenge scheme.\n\nAlone with Terry's lifeless body, Jay vowed to ensure everybody will discover the type of man Terry really was.\n\nHe warned: \"So you can keep your watches and rings, they can clap you in, but the time this funeral is over and they all go home they\u2019re gonna know it was for an old scumbag like you.\n\n\"They\u2019re gonna hear what man you really were whether they like it or not.\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nEastEnders viewers took to Twitter after watching the dark scenes unfold.\n\nOne viewer said: \"Really hope Jay doesn't end up getting killed off, he is a brilliant actor!\"\n\n\"Past has come to haunt him so trouble time ahead,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"Tonight poor jay his past childhood haunting him years later.
