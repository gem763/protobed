REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nThe European Union\u2019s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier made clear at a meeting of ministers in Luxembourg that if an agreement wasn\u2019t reached on Tuesday, it would be too late to send anything for the bloc\u2019s leaders to approve at their meeting on Thursday and Friday.\n\nHowever, as technical talks continued in Brussels, word emerged that gaps on an agreement had narrowed and the two sides were close to agreeing on a text.\n\nOne EU official said an agreement was \u201cclose but not 100% certain\u201d, adding \u201cthere are still parts that need to be nailed down\u201d. Others were more cautious: one senior official said it was \u201cway too premature\u201d to conclude that a deal was at hand.\n\nThe main sticking point remains the border between EU-member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.\n\nThree years after Britons voted in a referendum to quit the EU, negotiators are still wrestling with the question of how to prevent the border becoming a backdoor into the bloc\u2019s single market without erecting controls which could undermine the 1998 peace agreement that ended decades of conflict.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar confirmed that the Brexit talks had made progress and were moving in the right direction.\n\n\u201cThe initial indications are that we are making progress, that negotiations are moving in the right direction,\u201d Varadkar told reporters in Dublin.\n\n\u201cBut whether we will be able to conclude a revised withdrawal agreement, which after all is an international treaty, in time for the summit on Thursday, that\u2019s as of now unclear.\u201d\n\nVaradkar said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at a meeting last week that he was confident he could get a Brexit deal through the British parliament.\n\nAsked if he would still say the gap between the United Kingdom and the EU was a significant one, Varadkar replied:\n\n\u201cYes but these discussions are happening in Brussels at the moment, I\u2019m going to get a further briefing this evening so the situation may have changed even in the last few hours but the gap was still quite wide, particularly on the issue of customs.\u201d\n\nIf London is unable to clinch a deal, an acrimonious divorce could follow that would hit trade and business, roil financial markets and potentially lead to the United Kingdom splitting.\n\nEven if he wins the approval of Europe\u2019s big powers, Johnson must still sell any deal to a British parliament in which he has no majority.\n\nJohnson, a leading figure in the 2016 referendum who came to power as head of ruling Conservative Party in July, has pledged to take the country out of the bloc on Oct. 31 whether or not a withdrawal agreement has been reached.\n\nBut parliament has passed a law saying it cannot leave without an agreement and Johnson has not explained how he can get around that.", "description": "Britain and the EU made headway in eleventh-hour talks to work out a Brexit deal in time for a leaders' summit this week, but with hours left to clinch a deal it was still unclear whether London could avoid a delay to its Oct. 31 scheduled departure.", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441117350&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E14K", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
