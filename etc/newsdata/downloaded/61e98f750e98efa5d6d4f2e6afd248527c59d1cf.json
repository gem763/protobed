As she researched and interviewed people trying to find a balanced perspective she gained a \u201cunique insight\u201d into the impact that fashion had on the environment. \u201cI was rather shocked to find that so little was being done to address the problem of sustainability, back then,\u201d she tells Euronews Living, \u201cI felt disappointed at the lack of awareness\u201d.\n\nAnd so in 2007, she founded Redress, an NGO with the mission to reduce waste and promote circularity in fashion. As promises of circularity have become more appealing as a solution to the environmental crisis, Dean is hoping that designers can lead the way. \u201cThe circular economy can feel impossible to achieve,\u201d she says, \u201cour work educates and enables the industry and consumers about achievable points and actions to work towards sustainability\u201d.\n\nChristina Dean with ambassador Cara G Redress Design Awards\n\nAfter realising that there was a lot to be done in educating designers before they became industry leaders, Redress launched the world\u2019s largest sustainable fashion competition, the Redress Design Awards. \u201cIt is estimated that 80% of the environmental impact of a product is laid down at the design stage\u201d Dean explains, \u201c we\u2019ve witnessed a lack of access to education for emerging designers\u201d.\n\nShe hopes that the awards will plug a gap in education created by the rapidly changing nature of fashion. Redress want to see the awards inspire a more knowledgeable, sustainably-minded workforce to lead tomorrow\u2019s fashion industry. \u201cThat\u2019s why we see educating designers as an act of environmental activism,\u201d Dean says.\n\nRead More | What is a Circular Economy and how does it work?\n\nInspiration from the \"ashes of humanity\"\n\nThis year\u2019s winner, Maddie Williams, an Edinburgh College of Art graduate, is a junior designer at Pentland Brands. Her collection \u201cThe Mourners\u201d, she says, was inspired by a sense of \u201ceco-grief at the destruction of the natural systems that support us\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to us about the collection she says that it was influenced by the wealth of collective human knowledge: \u201c[It is] pieced together from what was saved from the ashes of humanity, referencing mourning dress and death gods from around the world, witches burned at the stake for their knowledge of the natural world, activist groups that fought to prevent the end of civilisation and ancient craft techniques.\u201d\n\nMaddie Williams with her model Redress Design Awards\n\nThe \u201cmemento-mori\u201d was a big influence for Williams, symbolising the rapidly decreasing time we have left to drastically change the way we consume; \u201cThis collection is influenced by memento-mori symbolism to emphasise that time is fast running out when it comes to climate change and that we must act now \u2013 in the same way that traditional memento-mori remind us that life is short and we must cherish it and focus on what really matters to us\u201d.\n\nHopes for the future of fashion design\n\nThe winning young designer is given the opportunity to create a sustainable collection for retail giving them access to the \u201creal world\u201d of fashion. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important to marry talent with experience so that we can build up the power of the next generation,\u201d Dean says. As well as experience she believes that it also provides budding industry leaders with hope. \u201cThere is a huge feeling of frustration, and fear, about the world of fashion that these designers are going into. The Redress Design Award gives them a foghorn to tell the world about the new era for fashion.\u201d\n\nIt's about more than looking to an idealistic future though, Dean tells us that the judges are trying to understand every one of the designer's choices from sourcing to life cycle but also the marketability of the collection. \u201cUltimately the design must also have a purpose,\u201d she says, \u201cthe finalists\u2019 entire choices must be defendable\u201d.\n\nBehind the scenes during the \"Made for Change\" finalists mini-challenge Redress Design Awards\n\nRead More | How Vivienne Westwood wants to bring down consumerism and the 'Rot$'\n\nThis year\u2019s competition saw entries from hundreds of designers across 43 countries with collections inspired both in their aesthetics and their creation by the circular economy. The tricky brief might seem like it would limit the possibility for varied concepts but even the sources for the entrant's fabrics were diverse as their styles. From saris to bed sheets to unwanted work uniforms, each chose a very different waste material to work with. People\u2019s Choice winner, Moriah Ardila from Israel, upcycled faulty tents and sleeping bags into clothing that retained some of the function of the original object.\n\nSustainability and fashion were a natural pair for the winner, Williams as her awareness of the climate crisis grew with her design knowledge.\u201cI know its cliche,\u201d she admits, \u201cbut watching the film \u2018The True Cost\u2019 really did move me and open my eyes to the issues facing the industry. After opening those floodgates I tried to educate myself more and incorporate what I was learning into my work.\u201d\n\nAt this very early stage in her career, Williams is fully convinced that circular production is the only way forward; \u201cif changes are not made by choice in time, the current model of the industry will collapse under the pressures of the Climate catastrophe. We will not be worrying about growing cotton when we cannot grow food.\u201d", "description": "Founder of Redress, Christina Dean, tells us about the organisation's Fashion award and how it hopes to shape the future.", "authors": ["Rosie Frost"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/44/96/1000x563_cmsv2_1243f65f-351e-546d-bd8b-1fd828dd7c70-4204496.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
