The outfit is now rarely seen and is dominated by a voluminous draped brown-gold outer robe with long, wide sleeves and a cinched waist.\n\nRoyal attire often includes motifs of birds, as they were considered divine envoys in ancient times and the emperor's outer garment is decorated with a mythical Chinese phoenix, believed to symbolise the arrival of peace.\n\nDuring the ceremony, the emperor and other male royals will carry a \"shaku\" or sceptre -- a narrow plain wooden plate not unlike a large shoehorn.\n\nIn the past, royals would sometimes attach \"cheat sheets\" to the back of the shaku to help guide them through complex rituals.\n\nBut the crowning glory of the emperor's outfit is the kanmuri hat, which consists of a simple flat black base and a towering black tail at the back that extends upright 60 centimetres (about 24 inches).\n\n- Fit for an empress -\n\nEmpress Masako will wear an elaborate outfit commonly known as \"junihitoe\" or many-layered robe.\n\nMasako is expected to wear outfits with part of the rich red sleeves and bottom visible underneath multiple layers of varying lengths. Top layers will be light lilac and green shades with light purple lapels.\n\nMasako's hair will be sculpted into a style that sweeps up and out to the sides with a long ponytail extending from the back and a large golden hairpiece pinned above her forehead.\n\nThe elaborate traditional outfit, which can be hard to walk in because of its weight, is rarely seen outside imperial rituals and weddings.\n\n- The sacred treasures -\n\nThe ceremony would not be complete without the presence of the \"sacred treasures\". Japanese mythology has it that the sun goddess Amaterasu bequeathed the imperial regalia to the imperial line two millennia ago.\n\nThe treasures are the \"Yata no Kagami\", a mirror, \"Kusanagi no Tsurugi\", a sword, and the \"Yasakani no Magatama\", an unspecified jewel.\n\nThe possession of the \"three sacred treasures\" is considered crucial evidence of an emperor's legitimacy, but there are no photos of them and even the emperor cannot see them.\n\nThe treasures were handed to the new emperor in the initial enthronement ceremony held on May 1.\n\nDuring the upcoming proclamation ceremony, a replica sword and the original jewel, will be brought in wrapped in cloth. Both are kept at the palace, along with a replica mirror that is not brought out for ceremonies.", "description": "Rarely seen outfits, elaborate thrones and ancient paraphernalia will adorn a sacred and sumptuous ceremony marking the formal ascension of Emperor Naruhito to Japan's Chrysanthemum Throne.
