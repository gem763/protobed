As the Trump administration continues its push to expand such development, top candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination agree that America\u2019s public land must be a tool in the fight against climate change, not a contributor to the problem.\n\nDuring CNN\u2019s marathon town hall on climate change Wednesday, candidates vowed to end oil, gas and coal leasing on federal land as part of a shared goal to decarbonizing the economy and prevent catastrophic warming. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro said they would also work to expand federally protected acreage.\n\n\u201cWe should not be selling or leasing public land for the purposes of drilling,\u201d Harris said.\n\nBanning such activity on the federal estate, Castro said, is \u201cconsistent with moving to sources of clean, renewable energy instead of dirty fossil-fuel energy.\u201d\n\nHarris and Casto stressed that preserving America\u2019s heritage would be a priority if elected president.\n\n\u201cWe actually need to undo the damage that this administration has done and then expand the lands that we\u2019re protecting in our country,\u201d Castro said. \u201cWe can do that.\u201d\n\nAlong with cutting a collective 2 million acres from a pair of protected national monuments in Utah \u2015 Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante \u2015 President Donald Trump has opened up millions of additional acres of land and offshore waters to drilling and mining.\n\nMost of the 10 Democratic candidates who appeared on stage Wednesday have released climate plans that call for reversing Trump\u2019s sweeping land rollbacks, safeguarding new sites or fully funding the popular Land and Water Conservation Fund, which uses offshore fossil-fuel revenue to protect natural areas and water resources. Castro, Harris, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and former Vice President Joe Biden have all committed to working toward protecting 30% of America\u2019s land and water by 2030.\n\n\u201cOur public lands support a growing outdoor recreation economy, provide important wildlife refuges and environments, and distinguish America from the rest of the world,\u201d Booker wrote in a post to Twitter. \u201cThey\u2019re also critical assets in the fight against climate change.\u201d\n\nChase Huntley, energy and climate director for The Wilderness Society Action Fund, told HuffPost in an email that it is \u201cheartening to see public lands and conservation recognized as a major part of a national climate solution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe next president must be ready to lead the climate response we need to see on our shared lands and waters,\u201d Huntley said. \u201cIf we are going to keep pace with what science demands, we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions on our public lands while also restoring protections for threatened forests, from the Southern Appalachians to Alaska\u2019s Tongass\u201d National Forest.\n\nAhead of Wednesday\u2019s forum, Harris released a $10 trillion climate plan that calls for \u201cdiversifying the marine and land ecosystems that we protect and targeting biodiversity hotspots and critical wildlife corridors,\u201d as well as using existing presidential authorities to set aside critical landscapes. Biden\u2019s plan promises to permanently protect areas like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \u2015 a pristine Alaska wilderness that the Trump administration is working to open to oil drilling \u2015 and to set up programs to reforest and expand renewable energy on federal lands.\n\nCastro\u2019s $10 trillion climate plan, also released this week, calls for designating new national monuments, parks and wildlife refuge and outlines a so-called \u201cGreen Opportunity Corps\u201d that would put 15,000 young adults to work in areas like public land conservation. He is the only candidate to put out an animal and wildlife welfare policy, which seeks to end euthanasia for household dogs and cats and strengthen protections for endangered species.\n\n\u201cWe need to connect the dots,\u201d Castro said Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve connected the dots of actually preserving more of our lands both for the benefit of wildlife and for our benefit to combat climate change.\u201d\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was not asked Wednesday about how she would approach America\u2019s public lands and waters, despite being the only candidate to release a comprehensive plan specific to protecting them. Her policy vision, unveiled in April, includes overturning Trump\u2019s land rollbacks, a moratorium on oil and gas leases on federal land, and recruiting 10,000 youth and veterans for a \u201c21st Century Civilian Conservation Corps.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to end our public lands\u2019 contribution to climate change,\u201d Warren wrote in an announcement at the time. \u201cWe have an enormous opportunity to make them a part of the climate solution, and for both economic and environmental reasons, we should take it.\u201d\n\nAll 10 candidates that participated in the CNN climate forum have voiced support for the Green New Deal, the landmark resolution unveiled in February by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and that outlined lofty goals of reaching net-zero emissions by midcentury. Supporters of the Green New Deal have said public land is key to its success. The plan calls for \u201censuring that public lands, waters, and oceans are protected\u201d and \u201crestoring and protecting threatened, endangered, and fragile ecosystems.\u201d\n\nQuestions posed to candidates on Wednesday varied, and not all were asked about public land and conservation. But nearly all have policy proposals that drive home the need for the nation to be a better environmental steward.\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (Texas) says he would go beyond previous presidents to \u201cprotect our most wild, beautiful, and biodiverse places for generations to come \u2014 including more of the Arctic and of our sensitive landscapes and seascapes than ever before.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has a $16 trillion plan that includes investing in public land conservation \u201cto heal our soils, forests, and prairie lands.\u201d\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) promises to streamline renewable energy permits on federal land and expand the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang says he would \u201cprotect and grow America\u2019s public lands and waters, and natural monuments, for future generations.\u201d\n\nAnd Pete Buttigieg plans to \u201cclose public lands to new fossil leases\u201d and on Wednesday voiced support for expanding the federal Conservation Stewardship Program, which provides support for conservation measures on small farms.\n\nFor more on the Democratic presidential candidates\u2019 climate plans, view HuffPost\u2019s cheat sheet.", "description": "2020 Democratic presidential candidates vow to make federal land part of the climate solution.", "authors": ["Environment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d717b4c2500007a12057a18.jpeg?cache=efa1aqa2mj&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
