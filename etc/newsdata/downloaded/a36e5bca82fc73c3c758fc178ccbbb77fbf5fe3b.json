It was a fantastic effort considering it was bombed, heavily bombed.\u201d\n\nAlf was joined by daughter-in-law Jennifer and granddaughter Nicola Pipes to celebrate his birthday at the Nottinghamshire care home where he lives.\n\nThey said: \u201cWhat a life he has had. We are immensely proud of him.\u201d\n\nAmong the dozens of cards he received was one from The Mercian Regiment, which now incorporates the Sherwood Foresters, with a message from Colonel of the Regiment General Ian Cave.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cThe courage and spirit you showed during your time with the 9 th Battalion, The Sherwood Foresters, is the very essence of what drives our soldiers today.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Gordon Sugg says he still feels lucky to be alive as he recalls how shrapnel hit his leg during attack in 1940", "authors": ["Andrew Smart", "Image", "Neil Lancashire Photography"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20571641.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_LAN_1764JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
