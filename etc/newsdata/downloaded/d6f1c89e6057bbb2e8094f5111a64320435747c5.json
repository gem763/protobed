And after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested this week that he had ignored the law, Mr. Maguire reacted with barely concealed anger.\n\n\u201cI have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way,\u201d he said in a statement on Tuesday. He had struggled to find a compromise that would allow Congress to get the information but take into account the legitimate legal concerns of the Department of Justice and allow the White House to protect material it viewed as privileged.\n\nMr. Maguire, who is among a handful of top intelligence officials who know about the complaint\u2019s contents, said he was committed to protecting whistle-blowers and appeared to defend the current complainant. All intelligence officials and officers \u201chave a solemn responsibility to do what is right, which includes reporting wrongdoing,\u201d he said.\n\nA former Navy SEAL who rose to three-star admiral and leader of the Naval Special Warfare Command over a 36-year career, Mr. Maguire has faced tough leadership challenges. A graduate of Manhattan College and a longtime Yankees fan, he has commanded at every level.\n\nFriends and former colleagues described him as a dedicated public servant who tends to cajole friends and foes alike toward a solution, often with a joke.\n\n\u201cJoe\u2019s life is about service,\u201d said Michael Leiter, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center , where Mr. Maguire served as deputy while in active service and later as director. \u201cAnd there is no way Joe is going to walk out on an incomplete mission.\u201d\n\nFor all the pressure Mr. Maguire has confronted in his first month on the job, he has told friends that he has faced worse. At the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the most deadly time for special operators, Mr. Maguire and his wife went to funeral after funeral to pay their respects and to represent the United States.", "description": "Mr. Maguire assumed the post last month.
