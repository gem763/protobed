The details of the new proposal are confidential, and GM was still waiting for the union's response as of Monday evening, two sources familiar with the matter told DFP.\n\nThe strike entered its fourth week Monday, and has already wiped out more than $4 billion from GM's market cap.\n\n\"These negotiations have taken a turn for the worse,\" UAW vice president Terry Dittes said in a Sunday letter to members. \"We, in this union, could not be more disappointed with General Motors.\"\n\nRead more: The General Motors strike is getting more expensive. It has likely cost the automaker more than $1 billion already.\n\nRoughly 46,000 workers began the strike on September 16. The automaker's stock has fallen roughly 9% since then and now trades at its lowest levels since early June.\n\nThe union's leadership is asking for entry-level pay raises, improved health care, and a faster process for short-term workers to earn higher salaries. The requests arrive as GM looks to produce more electric and autonomous vehicles, a change that would endanger the job security of many striking workers.\n\nA continued demonstration would further hit GM's third-quarter earnings, as the company can only make up for so much lost production. The automaker is scheduled to announce its latest quarterly figures October 29, and is likely to answer many questions regarding the strike during the related analyst call.\n\nGeneral Motors traded at $33.97 as of 12:50 p.m. ET Tuesday, up roughly 0.1% year-to-date. Shares have fallen 7.6% since the strike began on September 16.\n\nThe company has 16 \"buy\" ratings, six \"hold\" ratings, and no \"sell\" ratings from analysts, with a consensus price target of $47.78, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nThird-quarter earnings season is on the horizon.
