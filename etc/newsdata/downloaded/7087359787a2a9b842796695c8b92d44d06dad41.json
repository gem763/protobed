And the ADP Research Institute on Wednesday showed hiring at US companies cooling. Quarterly sales reports from General Motors and Ford also added to concern, sending those stocks lower.\n\nThe two-year US Treasury yield fell to 1.48 per cent on Wednesday from 1.55 per cent, reflecting expectations of lower Fed interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield fell for a fifth straight day as it pushed below 1.6 per cent.\n\n\"The tightening in financial conditions the past few days is putting more pressure on the Fed to ease again,\" said Sarah House, senior economist with Wells Fargo & Co.\n\nTrump again blamed Powell after the manufacturing data showed declines even though economists attribute the slowdown in large part to the trade wars. The President tweeted on Tuesday that the \"pathetic\" Fed has kept rates too high, leading to a rising dollar that hurts American manufacturers. \"They are their own worst enemies, they don't have a clue,\" he said.\n\nWhile Fed officials say they are not moved by criticism from the President or other officials, they are attuned to changes in the data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew York Fed president John Williams said the outlook was for \"slower US growth\", which he attributed to \"the effects of the trade tensions and other geopolitical tensions\". Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said he's watching to see if weak confidence in the outlook \"which we know has hit businesses now is starting to hit consumers\".\n\n\"Fed officials for the most part are trying to communicate that they want to be in a wait-and-see mode, but markets aren't interested in that message,\" said Stephen Stanley, Amherst Pierpont's chief economist. \"Remains to be seen whether Fed officials will change their tunes. \"\n\nWhile this week's reports have disappointed, most recent data outside of manufacturing have been mixed and growth during the third quarter is tracking about 1.8 per cent, according to the Atlanta Fed's estimate.\n\nOn Friday, the Labor Department will report payrolls and the unemployment rate for September, which could be key to the Fed in evaluating the outlook, said Northern Trust economist Carl Tannenbaum.\n\n\"The Fed might want to put the cuts in place in quick sequence - not much to gain from waiting,\" said Roberto Perli, a partner at Cornerstone Macro. \"Recent data and the drop in stock prices probably help in bringing around some of the sceptical committee members. The leadership might use the shift in market expectations to push for a cut this month as well.\"\n\nWashington Post", "description": "Markets placed about a 75 per cent chance of a quarter-point rate reduction at the October 29-30 meeting, up from 40 per cent on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6ae6d601c870079b042850f1110e9fdb52890cba", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
