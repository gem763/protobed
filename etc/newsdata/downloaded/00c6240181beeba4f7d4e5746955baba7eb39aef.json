When the cabinet meets, there are probably a lot of comments like: \u201cI agree with \u2026 that guy over there with the green tie.\u201d\n\nBut back to our contenders: Anybody having anything whatsoever to do with the environment is a good Worst candidate in this White House. Former winner E.P.A. chief Scott Pruitt has slunk away \u2014 remember the time he tried to use his influence to get his wife a Chick-fil-A franchise? His deputy, Andrew Wheeler, is now the top guy.\n\nWheeler used to be a lobbyist for energy companies and he seems determined to weaken car emissions limits even when the car manufacturers want to keep them. His critics say that if he can\u2019t get rid of environmental protection laws he doesn\u2019t like, he simply stops enforcing them.\n\nInterior Secretary David Bernhardt has replaced the dreaded Ryan Zinke, another former Worst contender. Previously Bernhardt was \u2014 yes! \u2014 Zinke\u2019s top deputy and before that \u2014- yes! yes! \u2014 a lobbyist for energy companies. One who had so many potential conflicts of interest he had to carry around a card listing all of them.\n\nSo, tough luck, endangered species. Bernhardt hates it when you get in the way of fuel extraction. But you have to admit he\u2019s making history. Bernhardt is the first interior secretary to be under investigation by the department\u2019s inspector general since his first day on the job.\n\nAnd Wilbur\u2019s back! Last season\u2019s winner, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross Jr., is most definitely looking for a repeat. We are thinking here of his threats to fire officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for reassuring Alabamians that a hurricane was not headed their way no matter what crazy maps a certain chief executive drew with his Sharpie.\n\nTransportation Secretary Elaine Chao doesn\u2019t seem to be doing much on national infrastructure. But she\u2019s been very energetic when it comes to boosting her family\u2019s shipping company and squeezing extra grants for Kentucky, which happens to be the state represented by her husband, Senator Mitch McConnell.", "description": "Vote for the absolute bottom.", "authors": ["Gail Collins"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/opinion/sunday/23COLLINS/23COLLINS-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
