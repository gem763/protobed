Even the police couldn't believe it when they arrived.\"\n\nAs he lay unconscious, members of Woodland staff \"did everything within their power to locate him\" and say were not informed of his condition.\n\nHe added: \"Thank God I had my phone with me.\n\n\"I was in total darkness and I always feel disorientated after a seizure. The police phone operator guided me to where they knew the fire exits were but it was difficult because I'm not very coherent when I first come 'round.\"\n\nPolice officers who attended took Ross home to Exmouth where his mother was caring for his sons Joshua, 10, and Jack, seven.\n\nRoss said when he disappeared at about 5pm the alarm was raised by his family who told Woodlands staff that he was vulnerable because of his epilepsy, reports Devon Live.\n\n(Image: Ross Down)\n\nHe said: \"My mum, step-dad and my boys looked for me and the team at Woodlands did a search but nobody could find me.\n\n\"I don't blame my family for leaving - the boys were upset and they had no idea what else to do.\"\n\nThe last thing he remembers is playing hide and seek and having fun with his boys.\n\nHe says he reached a section with strobe lighting, adding: \"There were no warning signs about the strobe lighting. I began to feel unwell and was looking for a way out.\n\n\"The next thing I knew I woke up lying on the floor in total darkness. I was really shaky and disorientated. There were no exit signs.\n\n\"The police phone operators talked me to the exit and I met the police. They came in with me to have a look because even they couldn't believe what had happened to me.\n\n\"I had rung my mum when I came round and she was so upset - she had tried to tell the staff that I was vulnerable. She felt that Woodlands were not taking the situation seriously.\n\n\"The police were amazing. They were shocked as well. \"\n\nThe incident happened three weeks ago on Saturday September 14 at around 5pm to 6pm.\n\n(Image: TripAdvisor)\n\nA spokesman for Woodlands Theme Park said: \"Woodlands Family Theme Park is a 130 acre site and we do our absolute best to ensure all areas of the park are secured down properly, however, we are also a campsite so customers can still use parts of the park in the evenings.\n\n\"On the 14th of September, the communication from the family who were visiting the park with Ross mentioned of a \u2019lost adult\u2019 and we did everything within our power to locate him but were unable to.\n\n\"A short while after, the family left the premises to return home, indicating that they potentially had located him themselves, we didn\u2019t receive any calls, emails or visits to reception from the family offering any more information on if he had or hadn\u2019t been found or that he suffered from Epilepsy. Upon speaking with the stepdad of the individual, he mentioned to our receptionist 'that\u2019s typical of what he does, he does it all the time', indicating he wasn\u2019t so concerned.\n\n\"Had the family mentioned to us that he suffered from epilepsy the procedure would be different and would involve further extensive search of the premises but as we didn\u2019t have that information we didn\u2019t. We receive countless reports of people missing only to be found 10 minutes later in the park by a member of staff or family member.\"\n\nRoss said he felt that neither himself or his family were treated seriously when they tried to raise the issues: \"I think what's important is that there are no warning signs on the strobe lighting and they were told that I am vulnerable.\n\n\"I think they should have better procedures to search the park when it closes.\"", "description": "Ross Down, 35, was playing hide and seek with his two sons in the Seascape Mirror Maze at Woodlands in Devon when strobe lighting triggered his epilepsy - before waking in complete darkness at 1am", "authors": ["Colleen Smith", "Image", "Ross Down", "Tripadvisor"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20540364.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Ross-Down.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
