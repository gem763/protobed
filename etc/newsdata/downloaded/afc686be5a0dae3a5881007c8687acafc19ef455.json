He has four, possibly six, weeks to convince other parties to back him.\n\nThe president chose him for the task because he has slightly more overall support in the newly elected Knesset than his main rival Benny Gantz, even though Mr Gantz's Blue and White Party has one more seat than Mr Netanyahu's Likud.\n\nAs the prime minister accepted the mandate, he stepped up the pressure for a broad unity government with Mr Gantz. Polls show that's what the voters want, but the two parties failed to reach a power-sharing agreement in talks this week, and Mr Gantz again refused Mr Netanyahu's terms.\n\nHe said would not do a deal with the prime minister's bloc of right-wing parties, or \"sit in a government whose leader was facing a severe indictment\".\n\nMr Netanyahu is particularly determined to keep his job because that would put him in a stronger position to deal with a possible indictment on corruption charges. He insists he is innocent and will be making his case at a hearing next week.\n\nOn Monday, Israeli-Arab lawmakers recommended that Mr Gantz, a former army chief, should become prime minister. The Joint List, a bloc of Arab parties that came third in the election, said it wanted to remove Mr Netanyahu from power.\n\nIt was the first time since 1992 that an Arab political group had issued an endorsement for an Israeli prime minister.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Israeli President Reuven Rivlin held a series of meetings to try to break the impasse\n\nThe Joint List won 13 seats in the election. If Mr Gantz had the endorsement of all 13 seats, he would still fall short of the 61 seats needed for a majority in the 120-seat legislature.\n\nLast week's election was called after coalition talks collapsed following April's poll.", "description": "The interim prime minister is tasked with setting up a new administration after coalition talks fail.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F0AC/production/_108921616_gettyimages-netanyahu-gantz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
