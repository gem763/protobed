The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) will include Christians (pictured above), Arabs and Kurds.\n\nThe SDF will reportedly be led by the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), and will have the support of the United States through weapons, equipment and air strikes.\n\nAlliance of Arabs, Kurds and Christians\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is an unprecedented union of Arabs, Kurds and Christians. Armed units from each of these groups have committed to working with one another to defeat the self-proclaimed Islamic State terrorist group. In its first public statement, the group said,\n\nDue to the accelerated conditions in both the political and the military development and the sensitive phases our country has gone through, there must be an establishment of a unified national military force to all Syrians consisting of Kurds, Arabs, Assyrians and all others living in the geographical locations of Syria.\n\nThe alliance will primarily focus on expelling the self-proclaimed Islamic State from Syria\u2019s ar-Raqqa governorate, where the Islamic State, or ISIS, has created a stronghold.\n\nSDF Led by the Kurds\n\nThe SDF will reportedly be led by the Kurdish YPG, and is said to include at least seven military groups, all of whom were cited in the SDF\u2019s first statement.\n\nThe military units that will make up the SDF include several militias from the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAC), including Jaysh Al-Thuwar (the Revolutionary, or Rebel Army), Burkan Al-Furat (Euphrates Volcano), and al-Sanadid Forces (Arab military unit of the Jarba tribe in Cizre Canton).\n\nIn addition to the Arab forces, the Syriac (Assyrian) Military Council has pledged its Christian militias to join the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), and Women\u2019s Protection Units (YPJ).\n\nProviding Rights for All\n\nIn a phone interview with Reuters, Nasir Haj Mansour\u2013 an official in the defense ministry of the Kurdish administration in YPG-held territory\u2013 said, \u201cthe current goal in practical terms is to confront [ISIS], given that it is the first enemy, but the goal is also to build a democratic Syria in the future.\u201d\n\nIn addition to creating a democratic Syria, the Syrian Democratic Forces are committed to creating rights for all Syrians.
