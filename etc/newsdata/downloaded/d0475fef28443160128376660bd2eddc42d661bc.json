We will not buy that,\u201d said DUP leader Arlene Foster.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Ireland\u2019s Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told the Irish parliament that if Britain\u2019s latest proposals for an agreement on leaving the European Union are its final offer then a no-deal Brexit lies ahead.\n\n\u201cThe Irish government\u2019s preparedness to dump the consent principle for their country\u2019s expediency is foolish in the extreme and sends a very clear message to unionists,\u201d Foster said.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar welcomed Britain\u2019s offer to the European Union but said customs arrangements and giving a veto to Northern Ireland\u2019s assembly over any future regulatory divergence from EU rules are a problem.\n\nBritain is due to leave the EU at the end of October but the two sides have not been able to agree the terms of their divorce. The biggest obstacle remains a deep disagreement over how to keep open the seamless border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Northern Ireland allies on Thursday accused their Irish neighbours of rejecting a reasonable offer and paving the road for a no deal exit from the European Union.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
