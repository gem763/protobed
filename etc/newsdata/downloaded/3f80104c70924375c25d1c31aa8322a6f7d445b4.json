In past years, celebrities including actresses Nicole Kidman and Scarlett Johansson, as well as athletes Kobe Bryant and David Beckham have appeared at the annual concert event.\n\nThe multiple Grammy Award-winning @taylorswift13 will perform at Alibaba\u2019s 11.11 Countdown Gala \u2013 a live show hosted by Alibaba\u2019s video streaming platform Youku that runs in the hours leading up to the world\u2019s biggest shopping day of the year. https://t.co/OEXXQI1Avh \u2014 Alibaba Group (@AlibabaGroup) October 28, 2019\n\nThis year, Swift is expected to join a lineup of Asian stars including G.E.M., Lay Zhang, Hua Chenyu, and Kana Hanazawa.\n\nThe American pop singer signed a worldwide recording agreement last year with Universal Music Group. China\u2019s Tencent has reportedly been in talks to acquire a 10 percent stake in UMG, which is owned by Vivendi.\n\nSwift\u2019s albums are immensely popular among Chinese consumers. Chinese sales of her latest album, \u201cLover,\u201d even outpaced U.S. sales in its first week of release, with one million combined total streams, downloads, and sales.\n\nWhile the U.S. entertainment industry was once eager to buddy up with China, their close business relationship has come under scrutiny in recent months in the wake of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong.\n\nHollywood is facing criticism that it censors content in order to please China\u2019s authoritarian Communist Party, which imposes strict controls on which foreign titles can be released locally.\n\nChinese companies like Alibaba operate in close cooperation with Beijing.\n\nEarlier this year, it was reported that Alibaba was behind a popular digital app titled \u201cStudy to Make China Strong,\u201d which feeds users Communist Party propaganda.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
