GitLab\u2019s newest investors include Adage Capital Management LP and Altimeter Capital Management LP. It plans to go public in November 2020, Mr. Sijbrandij said.\n\nPropelling growth at GitLab, incorporated in 2014, is a shift in how companies\u2019 information-technology teams develop software, with a focus on collaboration between various departments and fast and frequent deployments, the CEO said. Tools that can significantly speed up the time it takes to develop and deploy applications and new features are critical for companies seeking a competitive advantage, he added.\n\nGitLab, which doesn\u2019t have a formal headquarters and allows all employees to work remotely, plans to hire about 200 workers by year-end. Its current headcount is about 850.\n\nBuilt in the vein of collaborative tools like Google Docs, GitLab\u2019s platform serves as a central place where developer and operations teams, known as DevOps, work together to manage software development, testing, packaging and deployment. Without a common platform, teams typically have to work with separate tools and feedback between the two isn\u2019t immediate.\n\n\u201cFrequently, IT is the bottleneck to innovation in the company, so the faster they can get these things out, the happier their counterparts [in operations] will be,\u201d Mr. Sijbrandij said.\n\nThe company provides a free version of its platform but earns money through subscriptions for additional services and features. GitLab said its platform is used by more than 100,000 organizations. Its roughly 10,000 paying customers include 32 Fortune 100 companies, among them Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and Charter Communications Inc.\n\nNorthwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. has been using GitLab since 2015 to develop thousands of internal and customer-facing software applications, said Sean Corkum, senior engineer at the insurer.\n\nA screenshot of GitLab software-development tools.

Such changes to software applications could have taken a week or more in the past, he said.\n\nThe world-wide DevOps software-tools market is forecast to reach $15 billion in 2023, up from $5.2 billion in 2018, according to market-research firm International Data Corp.\n\nAdopting a DevOps approach to software development can improve companies\u2019 work flow, though it can be challenging for teams to get on board, said Jim Mercer, research director at IDC. \u201cYou can\u2019t underestimate the cultural challenges of something like DevOps,\u201d he said.\n\nSome companies are still using various tools from different vendors. \u201cThat\u2019s chaos. You can\u2019t scale that way,\u201d Mr. Mercer said. Businesses will continue to find value in limiting the number of tools they use, which is where GitLab offers an advantage, he said.\n\nGitLab\u2019s latest round of funding will be used in part to improve many of its software-developer tools, including those that can help IT teams monitor and improve their applications after they have been deployed, as well as those aimed at security, Mr. Sijbrandij said.\n\nWrite to Sara Castellanos at sara.castellanos@wsj.com", "description": "GitLab, a fully remote company that sells tools for software developers, said it has raised $268 million in new venture-capital funding thanks to strong demand for its products from corporations.", "authors": ["Sara Castellanos", "Sara.Castellanos Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107636/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
