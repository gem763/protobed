Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a great game, but it\u2019s a long way down my list of Star Wars games I\u2019d like to see get a remake. X-Wing/TIE Fighter, Knights Of The Old Republic, Rogue Squadron, Republic Commando\u2026 there\u2019ve been so many great game that are basically left hanging because Disney has so little interest in games.\n\nAnd yet they did do that out-of-nowhere Jedi Outcast remaster so I guess someone remembers they still have the rights. I have no idea what that was in aid of but the one I\u2019d most like to see remade is the first Dark Forces, when you weren\u2019t a Jedi and it was just blasters. I loved that game and it was well ahead of its time in terms of tech, but there\u2019s been nothing since that\u2019s had the same sort of grounded combat except for Battlefront which is all multiplayer.\n\nI would imagine a remake is very unlikely but I hope one day there\u2019s something similar, perhaps something based on The Mandalorian. I always like the non-Jedi stuff best in Star Wars and I guess that influences what I think is the best Star Wars game. But I really think Dark Forces is an underrated first person shooter beyond just that.\n\nIzzy", "description": "The Monday Inbox asks when the Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare review will be ready, as at least one reader calls for a Snatcher remake.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LEC_IA_3038-2400x1200-499893228849-3ef0_1571616156.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
