This is a 165-year old network, experiencing unprecedented growth with 1.4 million customer journeys a day. \u2014 T1 Sydney Trains (@T1SydneyTrains) October 10, 2019\n\nCommuters coming from the north and west were worst off with some Friday train travellers left sitting on Sydney Harbour Bridge for close to an hour.\n\n\u201cNot the best way to start a Friday. I stepped on the train at 7.10 and didn\u2019t get to Central until after 8,\u201d Vanessa, commuting from Kirribilli, told news.com.au.\n\n\u201cThe driver tried to give us accurate updates on the signal problem at Wynyard...but a 10 minute delay blew out to 30 minutes so I think he was as clueless as everyone on board about what was going on.\u201d\n\nAnother commuter claimed the train guard suggested they walk across the bridge to get to work in a timely fashion.\n\n70 mins from Milsons point Wynyard. @sydneytrains advising to walk across the bridge. \u2014 Richard Spaven (@EUCNut) October 10, 2019\n\nA woman also tweeted she had been told to jump between platforms for half an hour \u2014 to no avail.\n\n@T4SydneyTrains what\u2019s going on? I\u2019ve been jumping from platform to platform for the past 30 minutes and still haven\u2019t moved.. \u2014 abby (@abz________) October 10, 2019\n\nWhen you\u2019re conference started at 9am and your train terminates at central so you have to battle thousands of people just getting off the train let alone making further travel plans to walk \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f #Sydneytrains #SydPos19 pic.twitter.com/wkdHSCLQlb \u2014 Mrs Rowl (@RowlUpToClass) October 10, 2019\n\nOther angry commuters suggested they should\u2019ve been given their morning trip for free or at a discounted rate.\n\n\u201cEvery time there\u2019s delays, Sydney trains should charge the fares at a discounted rate. Yeah they\u2019ll lose profit but that should push them to make sure their services are efficient,\u201d Paola Rondario said.\n\nSydney Transport Stats, which collates data from around the city, said more than a third of trips \u2014 36 per cent \u2014 experienced delays this morning.\n\nSydney Trains\u2019 Twitter accounts have been busy this morning and as of 9.30am were still advising commuters of flow-on delays.", "description": "Sydney\u2019s rail system has been brought to its knees this morning after a broken down train at Central and a signal failure at Wynyard caused widespread chaos.", "authors": ["Natalie Wolfe"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7698da13bd1ea9ff5359ae9090b45ace?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
