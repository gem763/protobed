There are documented fatalities caused by the species in Japan and Korea.\n\nMatt Barrett, a mycologist from James Cook University who specialises in fungi, said Poison Fire Coral could cause \u201ca horrifying array of symptoms\u201d if eaten, including stomach pain, vomiting and fever. Eventually it can cause death by multiple organ failure or brain nerve dysfunction.\n\nFungus that draws gold from its surroundings discovered in Western Australia Read more\n\n\u201cOf the hundred or so toxic mushrooms that are known to researchers, this is the only one in which the toxins can be absorbed through the skin,\u201d Barrett said.\n\n\u201cMost fungi, even death cap (mushrooms) you can handle them fine without having any symptoms at all. To have a fungus that can cause symptoms on touch ... it\u2019s something we need to be aware of.\u201d\n\nBarrett said the fungus was \u201cmuch more widespread than it initially was thought to be\u201d and that the Cairns finding matched recent photographs from Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. This was the first time Poison Fire Coral had been sighted in Australia.\n\nPhotographer Ray Palmer said he found the fungus in a pocket of rainforest \u201cin a little hidden area but close to suburbia\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor anyone to find it they\u2019d have to deliberately be looking for it,\u201d he said.\n\nPalmer, who goes looking for fungi in the rainforest and other areas during the wet season, said he had photographed a similar species a few years ago.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw it I recognised it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been recorded south of Java, and Java is only a recent discovery.\n\n\u201cIt could be more widespread through the rainforest up here, there\u2019s a lot of areas slightly off the beaten track.\u201d\n\nBarrett said there was \u201cso much more to be found\u201d in northern Australia.\n\n\u201cThis is really right in suburban Cairns, it\u2019s not a difficult fungus to notice and it\u2019s suddenly turned up. Certainly we\u2019re interested in any more sightings that are made of it.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we can find such a distinctive and medically important fungus like Poison Coral right in our backyard shows we have much to learn about fungi in northern Australia.\u201d", "description": "Poison Fire Coral, the only known fungi whose toxins are absorbed through the skin, found on the outskirts of Cairns", "authors": ["Ben Smee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25f162c20d111806357b6ee0abb733235e64e97/0_74_2230_1338/master/2230.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=69b0097a4ec2e840e7a7c214ad1dc79b"}
