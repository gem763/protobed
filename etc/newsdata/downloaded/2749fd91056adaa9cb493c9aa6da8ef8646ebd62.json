So, several current-generation Surface devices -- including the Surface Laptop 2, Surface Go, and Surface Pro 6 -- are on sale.\n\nAlso: Best laptops for college and students in 2019\n\nWe've therefore listed Microsoft's entire existing Surface lineup with the best deal available for each device. We even spotted discounts on accessories like Surface Headphones.\n\nBest Microsoft Surface device deals\n\nIn order to find the absolute best deals on Surface devices, we compared prices among the most popular online retailers in the US. And to ensure you don't spend a lot, we specifically looked for bargains on entry-level models. However, if we spotted a better value elsewhere on the same model -- or even just a great discount on a more premium model or a first-generation device -- we made sure to include that information, as well.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 2\n\nBest Buy has the best deal, but technically, a cheaper model with less storage is on Amazon.\n\nIf you want to save more, consider the first-generation Surface Laptop. The 8GB/i7/256GB model is $799 at Newegg ($800 off original price). It's a couple years old but comes with a powerful i7 chip, rather than i5.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 6\n\nMicrosoft is offering $100 off Surface Pro 6, plus a free Type Cover accessory ($160 value), making it the best bargain, as you save $260. But both Amazon and Best Buy also have Surface Pro 6 as a standalone for $200 off.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Go\n\nAmazon may have the cheapest deal, but we prefer this Surface Go at Best Buy. It comes with the Type Cover accessory, so your total savings ends up being more (about $80 off).\n\nMicrosoft Surface Book 2\n\nIf you want 258GB of storage on your Surface Book 2, both Microsoft and Walmart are offering deals, at $200 and $180 off, respectively. However, Amazon has a better price on a similar configuration with less storage.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Studio 2\n\nUnfortunately, we couldn't find any deals on Surface Studio 2.\n\nBest Microsoft Surface accessory deals\n\nWant to buy some accessories to go with your newly purchased Surface device? Then check out the sales below.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Headphones\n\nMicrosoft sells its headphones for $350. However, they are discounted by $100 at several retailers, including at Amazon.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Pen\n\nMicrosoft's stylus has an original retail price of $99, but you can find it for about $30 off elsewhere, like at Amazon.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Arc Mouse\n\nMicrosoft is offering the back mouse for $65 ($15 off), while the light gray one is $12 off.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Pro Signature Type Cover\n\nAmazon has the Signature Type Cover listed at $97, a 29% savings. That's the best price we could find. Keep in mind Microsoft has a $159 original retail price for this keyboard accessory.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Dock\n\nAlthough Microsoft sells Surface Dock for $165 ($35 off), Amazon has a better deal for $135.\n\nFor more great deals on devices, gadgetry, and tech for your enterprise, business, or home office, see ZDNet's Business Bargain Hunter blog.
