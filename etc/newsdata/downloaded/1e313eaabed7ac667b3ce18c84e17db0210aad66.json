The states and consumer advocates generally insist the rule is too weak to help clients; the SEC says it improves investor protections while preserving the broker-dealer industry\u2019s business model.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue the SEC exceeded its authority to craft the rule by taking an approach that deviates from a model authorized by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law.\n\nThe statute said brokers could be required to follow the same standard of conduct that constrains investment advisers. Investment advisers must continually monitor their clients\u2019 best interest, while the brokers\u2019 duty is tied only to specific recommendations.\n\nThe SEC wound up not requiring brokers to follow the stricter standard, although regulators say the rules for brokers and advisers are now closer than they have ever been. While brokers and advisers are governed by two different standards, the industries have significant overlap and many households are confused by the difference between them. Most Wall Street firms offer both account types.\n\nBrokers are paid through sales commissions, which may vary by product, while investment advisers earn a fixed percentage fee levied on the value of a client\u2019s assets.\n\nThe SEC passed its rule, known as Regulation Best Interest, in June, with the commission\u2019s lone Democratic member voting against it. Supported by the financial industry, the rule relies largely on disclosures to investors and will preserve brokers\u2019 commission-based sales model.\n\nThe states say the SEC relied on flawed economic analysis to justify its approach, which is aimed at giving investors more information about brokers\u2019 complex pay incentives. The states say the rule was thus \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d a claim that businesses often use when they challenge federal regulations.\n\n\u201cWith this rule, the SEC is choosing Wall Street over Main Street,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \u201cInstead of adopting the investor protections of Dodd-Frank, this watered-down rule puts brokers first.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe lawsuit on Monday was filed by New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Mexico, Oregon and the District of Columbia. The complaint says they have standing to bring the lawsuit because the SEC\u2019s rule won\u2019t protect their residents from biased investment advice. Brokers are generally subject to both federal and state regulation.\n\nAn SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nSEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a speech Monday that regulators struck the right balance with their rule. Photo: shannon stapleton/Reuters\n\nSEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a speech Monday that the regulators struck the right balance with their rule, which says that brokers can\u2019t put their own financial interests ahead of their clients\u2019 needs and goals. Mr. Clayton is a political independent who was appointed by President Trump.\n\n\u201cThis comprehensive package brings the standards of conduct and required disclosures of financial professionals in line with what a reasonable investor would expect,\u201d Mr. Clayton told the Economic Club of New York.\n\nThe states\u2019 legal challenge echoes a fight over a similar rule imposed by the U.S. Labor Department during the Obama administration. That rule imposed a stricter standard of care, known as a \u201cfiduciary duty,\u201d on stockbrokers handling retirement accounts. In that case, business groups, including the main lobbying outfit for broker-dealers, successfully petitioned an appeals court in 2018 to overturn the regulation.\n\nGroups that advocate for retail investors say the SEC\u2019s rule won\u2019t rein in many harmful conflicts of interest.\n\n\u201cWhether we have to wait for a new administration to do this, or it can be achieved through a lawsuit, we believe the answer is for this rule to be scrapped and for the SEC to produce a strong, uniform fiduciary standard of care that covers both brokers and advisers,\u201d said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America.\n\nWrite to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com", "description": "Seven states asked a federal court to invalidate a regulation that requires stockbrokers to disclose more about conflicts of interest that could influence\u00a0their\u00a0financial advice, claiming the rule is weak.", "authors": ["Dave Michaels"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105529/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
