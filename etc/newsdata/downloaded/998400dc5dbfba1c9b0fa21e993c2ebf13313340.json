But Hagibis is predicted to wreak far more havoc and it could have a major impact on the final round of World Cup pool matches.\n\nWhile contingency plans have not been officially confirmed, tournament organisers may have to switch \u2018Le Crunch\u2019 to another venue, if it has to be postponed until Sunday, as hosts Japan take on Scotland at Yokohama Stadium that evening.\n\nIn the event of a cancellation, the England-France match would be declared a no-score draw, leaving Jones\u2019s men top of Pool C - but also meaning they could be pitched into a quarter-final the following Saturday under-cooked.\n\nWorld Rugby last night issued an update about the approaching typhoon and the implications, which read: \u2018It remains too early to fully predict the movement and impact of the storm, however the latest modelling by our weather information experts indicates that it is now tracking north and east and will bring strong winds and heavy rain to Tokyo and surrounding areas on 12 October.\n\n\u2018Public and team safety is our No 1 priority. While we have robust contingency plans in place for pool matches, such plans, if required, will only be actioned if the safety of teams, fans, and workforce can be guaranteed.
