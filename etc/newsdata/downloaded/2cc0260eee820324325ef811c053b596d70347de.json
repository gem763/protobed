They compared r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, sized each other up \u2014 Pacino still remembers De Niro as having \u201can unusual look and a certain energy\u201d \u2014 and each walked away wondering what the future held for himself and the man he had just met.\n\nA half-century later, they ambled into a suite at a luxury hotel on the River Thames to talk about their new film, \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d with so many of those uncertainties put to rest long ago.
