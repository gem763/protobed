Farrow published a blockbuster story about Weinstein in the New Yorker seven weeks later.\n\nAD\n\nOn Friday, the call for NBC to come clean on the Weinstein episode came from inside the house. In an extraordinary segment on her MSNBC show, Rachel Maddow urged NBC News to undertake an independent investigation of the network\u2019s conduct.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe allegations about the behavior of Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer are gut-wrenching,\u201d said Maddow, MSNBC\u2019s biggest star and the second, after MSNBC host Chris Hayes, to call out her bosses on an NBC-owned platform. \u201cBut accusations that people in positions of authority in this building may have been complicit in some way in shielding those guys from accountability \u2014 those accusations are very, very hard to stomach.\u201d Maddow said she had independently confirmed that NBC had halted Farrow\u2019s reporting, a key claim in the book.\n\nFarrow, who was a guest on Maddow\u2019s Friday show, was booked weeks in advance. NBC News\u2019s parent company, NBC\u00adUniversal, tried to get ahead of Maddow\u2019s commentary by issuing a statement releasing former NBC News employees from any \u201cperceived obligation\u201d not to speak publicly about sexual harassment at the network during their time of employment. The edict covers employees who signed severance agreements that contain nondisparagement clauses.\n\nAD\n\nHer booking of Farrow caused consternation inside the building, given that NBC executives had so vehemently attacked Farrow and his book, according to three current NBC staffers.\n\nAD\n\nNBC\u2019s statement was more of a public clarification than a new policy: In the run-up to the release of Farrow\u2019s book, NBC News officials emphasized that no employees were ever prohibited from discussing allegations of harassment after leaving the network. Farrow claims otherwise; he reports that NBC had at least seven such nondisclosure agreements with former employees, including several Lauer accusers, that helped NBC cover up widespread harassment.\n\nIn any event, the statement seemed to backfire. Critics immediately seized on a caveat \u2014 that women who wanted to speak about their experiences had to check with NBC\u2019s legal department for clearance first, apparently giving the network veto power over any public statements.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf NBC Universal is truly committed to letting survivors and employees speak out about sexual harassment at the network, it should simply release them from their nondisclosure agreements,\u201d said Tina Tchen, the incoming chief executive of Time\u2019s Up, an anti-harassment advocacy group. \u201cThere is no reason to place the burden on those who choose to speak to reveal themselves in advance to NBCUniversal.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAri Wilkenfeld, an attorney who has represented several former NBC employees, called the language in NBC\u2019s statement \u201cvague and intimidating.\u201d Wilkenfeld\u2019s clients include Brooke Nevils, a \u201cToday\u201d show producer who in Farrow\u2019s book accuses Lauer of raping her. While he would not comment on Nevils\u2019s case specifically, he said, \u201cGiven the company\u2019s conduct to date, I\u2019m not sure how many people are going to feel comfortable reporting to NBC and asking permission to tell their stories. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if NBC is truly interested in reconciling with its past and present problems.\u201d\n\nNBC says it essentially has.\n\nAD\n\nIn interviews, network officials deny any pattern of harassment complaints or \u201chush-money\u201d settlements, and say Lauer was fired just hours after Nevils came forward with her accusation in late 2017 \u2014 the first such accusation against Lauer the officials said they\u2019d heard. Lauer\u2019s conduct, they add, was investigated internally, and a report of that investigation was made public. Since then, the network has improved its training and workplace reporting practices, they said.\n\nAD\n\nBut NBC has resisted calls for the kind of independent investigation that other news organizations have undertaken in the wake of harassment scandals. Among others, CBS, NPR and Fox News have employed outside law firms to look into allegations against their senior executives.\n\nNor do NBC\u2019s ongoing PR troubles appear to have threatened the careers of the two men at the center of it, NBC News President Noah Oppenheim and NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack. Farrow points a finger repeatedly at both men in \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d characterizing them as duplicitous, arrogant and untruthful in managing and then effectively killing the Weinstein story.\n\nAD\n\nHowever, both appear to have the backing of a third powerful figure, NBCUniversal Chief Executive Steve Burke, their boss. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Andy and Noah have [Burke\u2019s] support, and that has allowed them to ride this out as long as the evidence is in their favor,\u201d said a person familiar with NBC\u2019s management. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity, deferring to NBC\u2019s official statements on the matter.\n\nAD\n\nOf the two, Lack\u2019s continued hold on the top spot seems the most remarkable.\n\nSince returning to the network as chairman of its news division in 2015, he has overseen high-profile controversies and missteps: anchor Brian Williams\u2019s suspension and demotion for exaggerating his reporting exploits; the network\u2019s apparent suppression during the 2016 presidential campaign of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording from 2005 in which Donald Trump bragged about grabbing women; Lauer\u2019s firing for sexual misconduct in 2017; Farrow\u2019s accusations about Weinstein and Lauer; and the signing of Fox News host Megyn Kelly to a huge contract that resulted in a low-rated talk show and her eventual departure from NBC.\n\nAD\n\nFor Lack, the adverse publicity generated by these episodes has been counterbalanced by NBC News\u2019s ratings and financial performance during his tenure, his supporters at the network say.\n\nAD\n\nOver the past four years, NBC News\u2019s three most important programs \u2014 \u201cToday,\u201d \u201cNightly News\u201d and \u201cMeet the Press\u201d \u2014 have led the ratings among viewers ages 25 to 54, the key category for advertisers, although competitors often have more total viewers. In addition, MSNBC\u2019s ratings and revenue have increased to record levels in each of the past four years.\n\nIn fact, NBCUniversal gave Oppenheim a strong vote of confidence by renewing his contract earlier this year, according to the Wall Street Journal. Lack is expected to retire after the election next year, and Oppenheim is expected to succeed him.\n\nAD\n\nAn NBC News spokesman and Farrow declined on-the-record comment.\n\nInside NBC News, journalists say they have been watching the drama surrounding Farrow\u2019s book with a mixture of bafflement, resignation and some anger. Others dispute Farrow\u2019s characterization of events, saying they stand by Oppenheim and a team of producers at NBC who have said his Weinstein story didn\u2019t meet NBC\u2019s reporting standards at the time Farrow walked away in frustration.\n\n\u201cShould NBC have worked harder and published his reporting in a web story\u201d based on what he knew at that time, asked one NBC journalist who is supportive of Lack and Oppenheim. \u201cArguably so. But that\u2019s an easier call in hindsight than at the time.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Despite the network\u2019s efforts to defend itself, allegations from the former correspondent keep resonating.", "authors": ["Sarah Ellison", "Reporter Covering Media", "Its Intersection With Politics", "Paul Farhi", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oLL9j6Re3YRNzSir_D4kjAgJHJI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VA4ERBHK4AI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
