Ten years ago today, an all-time classic video was posted to YouTube: \u201cSurprised Kitty,\u201d featuring an adorable little kitten looking surprised when its mom plays peekaboo. Look at this little snug bug!\n\nWhat reminded me to mention this? A cool website called YouTube Decade, made by Bennett Feely, which shows you the videos that have gotten the most views since the day they were uploaded 10 years ago today.\n\nI\u2019ve been checking into YouTube Decade regularly for the past couple months. Some that have taken me down memory lane: \u201cMario Party 2: Luigi wins by doing absolutely nothing\u201d (still cracks me up), the Annoying Orange (still cringey), and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cHalo\u201d music video (OMG \u201cHalo\u201d is 10 years old???).\n\nMuch like YouTube itself, YouTube Decade isn\u2019t always fun. More than a few of the top \u201cpets & animals\u201d videos are of animals humping; a stark reminder that YouTube has struggled for years with inappropriate content that gets engagement due to its shock value.\n\nBut when something like \u201cSurprised Kitty\u201d shows up, it\u2019s a nice reminder of a simpler time on the internet \u2014 even if YouTubers used to post a lot of iffy content back then, too.", "description": "Allow me to bring a little nostalgia and cuteness to your Monday.
