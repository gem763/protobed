I\u2019m so bad I often open a draft email in Gmail to jot down ideas (that I\u2019m likely to forget or never come back to), reminders, and anything else I deem note-able. But I\u2019ve finally stumbled upon an app that might get me out of this bad habit. Enter Zen, a minimalist browser-based text editor.\n\nThe best thing about it that Zen means business. First off, it only stores your data locally \u2014 nothing ever gets uploaded to a remote server. There\u2019s also hardly any clutter or fancy features to distract you from the task at hand, while still sporting an aesthetically pleasing design.\n\nThe features that it does have, though, make perfect sense \u2014 like the teardrop button to change the color scheme so it better suits your eyes. It\u2019s got a couple of light and dark themes, so you should be fine. Oh, and you can your notes to a .txt file when you\u2019re done typing.\n\nThe only slightly gimmicky function is the toggle to enable typerwriter sounds (which I would personally never use) but I\u2019m not mad about it \u2014 I kinda dig it actually.\n\nYou can also switch between three different fonts, in case you don\u2019t find the default one stimulating enough for your writing. Currently, the editor supports Serif, Sans Serif, and Monospace. Its minimalist approach means there\u2019s no indicator showing the font you\u2019re using, but you can resort to the Inspect feature in your browser to find out.\n\nSince Zen is practically a website, this means you can access it from any browser, without the need for installing extensions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created Zen for ourselves a couple of years ago to easily write and edit texts [without] leaving a browser,\u201d one of the Zen makers, Nazir Dashtiev writes. \u201cZen is not something completely unique, it\u2019s inspired by apps like a5.gg, Zenpen and Writer. We\u2019ve combined features we like and also added some new ones we were missing.\u201d\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting that Zen\u2019s best assets are also some of its shortcomings.\n\nFor one, keeping data locally in your browser means you won\u2019t be able to readily access it from other devices. For that, you might want to try Evernote or Dropbox\u2019s Paper, which my colleague Abhimanyu Ghoshal has previously written about.\n\nCheck out Zen by clicking here.", "description": "Zen is a minimalist browser-based text editor.
