It wants to rewrite a rulebook that it believes created the economic hardship that fueled the Brexit vote.\n\nLabour lawmakers and activists gather this weekend to start their get-together to discuss policy and settle on a new election manifesto. The party has previously pledged to renationalize railways, water companies and the country\u2019s electricity grid.\n\nIt has called on the U.K. Treasury to steer private investment into favored industries. It wants workers on company boards and higher taxes on the rich. It has toyed with moving the Bank of England from London to Birmingham.\n\nBehind the party\u2019s shift to the radical left is John McDonnell, 68 years old and a close ally of party leader Jeremy Corbyn. Mr. McDonnell wants to become the U.K.\u2019s first avowedly socialist finance minister in half a century.\n\nSix years ago, he was a nobody in Labour, politically sidelined, recovering from a heart attack and preparing for retirement.\n\nToday, as the party\u2019s powerful economy chief, he is the architect of a bold and controversial plan to reshape the British economy. He recently spoke favorably of banning bankers\u2019 bonuses, imposing a new tax on all financial transactions and jailing advisers who help companies and individuals evade tax.\n\nMr. McDonnell, a proud Liverpudlian, says he is no firebrand, just a messenger for a new, post-financial-crisis reality, where voters\u2019 economic anxiety is fueling political ferment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now in a period of introspection about how the system works,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said in an interview earlier this year in his cluttered office in Westminster. \u201cPeople are looking at different ideas and socialism has come back onto the agenda.\u201d\n\nBritish politics is in turmoil. Almost three years of inconclusive wrangling over how to act on the 2016 referendum decision to leave the European Union has ruptured the two main parties and left Parliament in gridlock. The country faces unprecedented constitutional strains, with Queen Elizabeth and the courts at risk of being drawn into the political fray.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is angling for swift elections to break the logjam and deliver on his \u201cdo or die\u201d promise to take Britain out of the EU when the current Brexit deadline expires on Oct. 31.\n\nBut opposition parties, Labour included, are wary. They are pushing to delay any poll until November or later to lessen the risk the U.K. leaves the bloc at the end of next month without a negotiated settlement to smooth its withdrawal.\n\nLabour is nevertheless on an election footing. For months, Mr. McDonnell\u2019s treasury team has been working on tax-and-spending plans to implement immediately if Labour wins power. He has been touring provincial towns and cities to hear policy ideas from ordinary folk and work them into Labour\u2019s economic plan.\n\nMr. McDonnell speaking to union members in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square during a march on May 1.

He once worked on a TV assembly line. He and Mr. Corbyn, a close ally, spent decades on the periphery of the Labour Party among a tiny band of hard-left holdouts after former Prime Minister Tony Blair shifted the party closer to the political center.\n\nLike Mr. Corbyn, Mr. McDonnell has courted controversy during a checkered career. He was fired from his job as finance chief of the council that ran London in the 1980s for refusing to implement a government-imposed cap on local taxes. He was once sued for libel by a political rival and settled out of court. He has praised the \u201csacrifices\u201d made by the Irish Republican Army during its bloody campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland.\n\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn speaking in the House of Commons earlier this month during the debate of a government motion calling for an early election.

Since then the party has sought to tap a wellspring of anger in parts of Britain plagued by insecure work, poor wages and cuts to public services, daily challenges that Labour officials argue contributed to the Brexit vote.\n\n\u201cAt the bottom of a recession, it\u2019s all about survival. As we start to come out, and we\u2019re told we\u2019re coming out of recession, and you don\u2019t feel you\u2019re sharing in that, that\u2019s when people really start questioning the system,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said in the interview.\n\nPolicies such as public control of railways and utilities are popular with voters, opinion polls show. But Labour is trailing Mr. Johnson\u2019s Conservatives in the polls, with a regular survey of voting intentions by YouGov PLC giving the prime minister\u2019s party a 12-point lead.\n\nYet those polls suggest the Conservatives will only get 34% of the vote and would struggle to command a majority. That leaves open the prospect of a Labour-led administration cobbled together with smaller opposition groups, such as the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Nationalist Party.\n\nLabour\u2019s political opponents and some pollsters say the party\u2019s main handicap is Mr. Corbyn, who is wildly popular among the enthusiastic young Labour supporters who swept him to power in 2015 but less so with the wider public. According to a poll published on Sept. 17 by YouGov, just 21% of Britons holding a positive opinion of him and 70% a negative one. The party has also struggled to shake off allegations that Mr. Corbyn tolerates anti-Semitic behavior in its ranks.\n\nMr. McDonnell dismisses the criticism of Mr. Corbyn, citing Labour\u2019s 30 gains in the 650-seat House of Commons during elections in 2017 under his close ally\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cI want to see a fundamental reshaping of the way our economy works as the first priority of a Labour government,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said in a July speech. \u201cAnything less will be papering over the cracks of our political and economic system.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com and Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com", "description": "John McDonnell, a close ally of party leader Jeremy Corbyn, seeks to become the U.K.\u2019s first avowedly socialist finance minister in half a century, pushing higher taxes on the rich and renationalized railways and utilities.", "authors": ["Jason Douglas", "Max Colchester", "Jason.Douglas Wsj.Com", "Max.Colchester Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109370/social", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
