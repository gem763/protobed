Another shows her nude and combing the hair of female staffer Morgan Desjardins, with whom she and her husband allegedly had a \u2018throuple\u2019 relationship.\n\nAlso on rt.com Presumption of innocence? Dems call for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment amid new sex assault allegations\n\nThe California representative is under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for her alleged affair with another staffer - this one her legislative director, Graham Kelly. Unlike her affair with Desjardins, which began before she was elected, that relationship violates House rules. Hill allegedly left her husband for Kelly and has blamed her \u201cabusive\u201d ex for trying to humiliate her - as well as her opponents for exploiting her tumultuous love life for political gain. She has admitted her relationship with Desjardins - she\u2019s openly bisexual - but denied the affair with Kelly.\n\nLeaked texts from the trio suggest Hill became estranged from her husband and Desjardins after moving to Washington in January, leaving them both psychologically distraught. They also shared concerns about Hill\u2019s alcohol use, suggesting it was affecting her work and mental health.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the steamy saga set social media alight. Democrats cried foul over Hill\u2019s persecution, which has been an ongoing item in the conservative press, and insisted she wouldn\u2019t be receiving this treatment if she was a Republican. Republicans shot back, accusing Hill of hypocrisy over her trash-talking Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court justice whose nomination sparked protests after several women accused him of sexual assault decades in the past.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still shaming grown women are we?\u201d one user complained. Several made comparisons to Trump and suggested Hill was still doing pretty well, by that measure.\n\nWhat Katie Hill does in the privacy of her bedroom is HER business, not that of anyone else.\n\n\n\nYou @GOP types forfeited the right to scream family values the day you nominated a pussy-grabber for President. You besmirch your faux religion by supporting an amoral asshole! \u2014 Mike Sarzo (Text VOTE to 954-954) (@mikesarzo) October 24, 2019\n\nI dont want to hear any republican criticize Katie Hill when Trump has 23 women accusing him of rape and assault \u2014 Tess \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a (@teslagre4) October 24, 2019\n\n\u201cKatie Hill will be gone soon, but if she were a Republican she would have been gone on day one,\u201d a GOP sympathizer opined. Many harped on the hypocrisy.\n\nThis is the make or break point\n\n\n\nIf she isn't forced to resign by DEMOCRATS\n\n\n\nThen I NEVER WANT TO HEAR SHIT from them about what a Republican has done\n\n\n\nEVER!!!!!!!\n\n\n\nDemocrat Rep.
