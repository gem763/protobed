REUTERS/Kacper Pempel\n\nOpinion polls show that Kaczynski\u2019s Law and Justice Party (PiS), a eurosceptic grouping with a nationalist tilt, is likely to win its second term in office but the turnout in his rural heartland could determine whether it can govern alone or must seek allies among the opposition.\n\nKaczynski wants a strong mandate for PiS so it can expand anti-liberal policies that have met resistance from its European Union partners, including judicial and social reforms.\n\nWidely seen as Poland\u2019s de facto ruler, he has been pulling the strings of government from behind the closed door of his nondescript office building in central Warsaw, holding no official posts other than his lawmaker\u2019s mandate as a member of Parliament.\n\nIn recent weeks, however, the childless bachelor who reportedly likes to eat lunch alone in his office has instead toured numerous small towns and villages, sampling sausage and quince brandy at PiS-run \u201cfamily picnics\u201d.\n\nWith crowds chanting \u201cJaroslaw! Jaroslaw!\u201d, he shook hands and hugged children with an uneasy smile.\n\n\u201cI feel wonderful, I didn\u2019t expect something like this to happen to me,\u201d said Magdalena Warchol, a 39-year-old shopkeeper who receives the PiS-introduced state subsidy for her three children, during a meeting in Stalowa Wola in central Poland.\n\nDressed in his trademark dark suit he wears to commemorate his twin brother Lech who died as Polish president in a plane crash over Russia in 2010, Kaczynski had kissed Warchol\u2019s hand in an old-fashioned gesture practiced by many men in Poland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s indescribable,\u201d she said. \u201cI always vote for PiS.\u201d\n\nEYES ON TURNOUT\n\nBack in Warsaw, visiting foreign dignitaries tend to make a stop in his office on Nowogrodzka Street - a central location that has become synonymous with power in Poland\u2019s political parlance.\n\nSparingly furnished, Kaczynski\u2019s Nowogrodzka office is where he meets senior government officials, including, occasionally, the prime minister. He visits the government headquarters rarely and only for official events, people close to Kaczynski say.\n\nKaczynski has cast the election as a chance to finish his grand ambition of correcting Poland\u2019s course since the end of communism in 1989. He believes the nation had abandoned its Catholic and patriotic values to please liberal allies in the West.\n\n\u201cWe have to defend Poles from a belief that\u2019s being forced on them: that to be affluent, to live well, like in the West, you have to be like them. You don\u2019t have to,\u201d Kaczynski told supporters in southeastern Poland.\n\n\u201cThey are going through a sickness, and to demand from us that we let them infect us is asking too much.\u201d\n\nWhat worries PiS is voter complacency. After four years in power, punctuated by scandals in state institutions that had little impact on the party\u2019s popularity, PiS is polling around 40-44%, the largest support of any political party in Poland. Its unshakeable popularity stems largely from its massive welfare payouts. It won 37.6% in the 2015 election.\n\nTurnout is traditionally lower in rural areas, where the majority of the core PiS electorate live: less well-off voters whose lives have been improved by the party\u2019s flagship child subsidy program.\n\n\u201cTurnout is extremely important from our point of view. It works to our advantage,\u201d Arkadiusz Mularczyk, a senior PiS lawmaker, told Reuters this week. \u201cPolls show PiS has a chance to win but that shouldn\u2019t put our voters to sleep. They may be feeling complacent.\u201d\n\nPiS officials hope Kaczynski, 70, whose power over PiS is undisputable in Poland, can mobilize voters to get to the ballot box on Sunday.\n\n\u201cHis presence during party conventions is incredibly important,\u201d Mularczyk said. \u201cKaczynski appreciates the Polish soul perfectly. His speeches have a broad meaning and reflect our philosophy of governance.\u201d\n\nPiS came out on top during the European Parliament election in May, when voter turnout hit a record 45.6% for the Europe-wide vote in Poland, compared with less than 24% five years earlier.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nThe national vote will take place against a backdrop of mounting political polarization in Poland. PiS has cast the election as a choice between a fair society that espouses Catholic values and a liberal order that promotes a chosen few and endangers family life.\n\nA survey by IBRIS, pollster for Rzeczpospolita newspaper, showed that only 39% of PiS voters are \u201cvery determined\u201d to cast a vote, against 69% of Poles who support the centrist Civic Platform, Poland\u2019s main opposition party formerly led by EU Council President Donald Tusk.\n\nMore than 90% of supporters of a left-wing bloc, which is polling third, said they are very determined to vote.", "description": "Long cast as a reclusive backstage strategist, Poland's conservative chief Jaroslaw Kaczynski is testing out a new role as charismatic leader as he campaigns to mobilize the rural vote ahead of Sunday's parliamentary election.", "authors": ["Justyna Pawlak", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439591486&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0IN", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
