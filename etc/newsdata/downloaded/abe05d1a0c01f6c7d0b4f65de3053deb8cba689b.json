Authorities said 1,349 people had been injured and 1,152 detained in the demonstrations.\n\nThe violence forced Moreno to relocate his government to Ecuador\u2019s second city, Guayaquil, and hit the oil industry hard with the energy ministry suspending more than two-thirds of its distribution of crude.\n\nProtesters seized three oil facilities in the Amazon.\n\n\u2013 Buildings ransacked \u2013\n\nCONAIE had previously rejected an offer of dialogue but reversed course Saturday.\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres earlier called on all groups \u201cto commit to inclusive and meaningful talks, and to work in good faith towards a peaceful solution.\u201d\n\nEcuador\u2019s indigenous groups make up a quarter of the country\u2019s 17.3 million people. Thousands from disadvantaged communities from across the Amazon and the Andes have traveled to Quito to spearhead demands the subsidies be reinstated.\n\nDemonstrators on Saturday ransacked and set fire to the building housing the comptroller general\u2019s office, which was shrouded in thick smoke after being attacked with fire bombs.\n\nThe prosecutor\u2019s office said 34 people were arrested.\n\nProtesters on Saturday also targeted a television station and a newspaper.\n\nThe Teleamazonas TV channel interrupted its regular broadcast to air images of broken windows, a burned vehicle and heavy police presence on the scene.\n\nThe station evacuated 25 employees, none of them hurt.\n\nNearby, protesters built barricades in front of the National Assembly building as police fired tear gas at them.\n\n\u201cWe have nothing to do with the events at the comptroller\u2019s office and Teleamazonas,\u201d said CONAIE.\n\nEl Comercio newspaper reported on Twitter that its offices were attacked by a \u201cgroup of unknowns.\u201d\n\nProtesters did not immediately heed the curfew that went into effect on Saturday, with security forces struggling to impose order in some parts of the city.\n\n\u201cWhere are the mothers and fathers of the police? Why do they let them kill us?\u201d cried Nancy Quinyupani, an indigenous woman.\n\nThe restrictions in Quito, a city of 2.7 million, came on top of a state of emergency Moreno had declared on October 3, deploying some 75,000 military and police and imposing a nighttime curfew in the vicinity of government buildings.\n\nMoreno is struggling with an economic crisis that he blames on waste and corruption by Correa\u2019s administration.", "description": "Quito (AFP) \u2013 Ecuador\u2019s president and indigenous leaders reached an agreement Sunday to end nearly two weeks of violent protests against", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/ae00bc_ecuador-president-lenin-moreno-speaks-flanked-by-archbishop-luis-gerardo-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
