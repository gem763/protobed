The update also included minor bug fixes for Apple's own apps like Safari and Reminders.\n\nApple doesn't usually release so many updates in rapid succession. iOS 13 only launched 11 days ago, and it has already received three updates. As we noted in our review of iOS 13, it's a major and ambitious update compared to last year's iOS 12, but iOS 13 had a relatively rocky beta period, and a number of kinks still need to be ironed out even after today's update.", "description": "A rocky iOS 13 launch has led to an unusually brisk pace of bug-fix updates.", "authors": ["Samuel Axon"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-with-Pro-and-Pro-Max-front-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
