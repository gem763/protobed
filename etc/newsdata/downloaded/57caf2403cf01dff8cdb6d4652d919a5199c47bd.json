But she spoke with Farrow, a New Yorker reporter who helped break the allegations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, for his book, \u201cCatch and Kill.\u201d\n\nVICE News has not seen the book, which is scheduled to be released in mid-October, but the details of Nevils\u2019 interview were obtained by Variety. Lauer, in a letter to Variety Wednesday morning, denounced Nevils\u2019 allegation as \u201ccategorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense.\u201d\n\nIn Farrow\u2019s book, Nevils reportedly says Lauer raped her while they were in Sochi, Russia, for the 2014 Olympics. Nevils was then working with Meredith Veira, another former \u201cToday\u201d anchor, and the two ran into Lauer at the hotel bar, according to Variety. She allegedly had six shots of vodka, and eventually went back to Lauer\u2019s hotel room.\n\nThere, Nevils says, Lauer pushed her against the door, kissed her, and then pushed her onto the bed. He allegedly asked her if she liked anal sex, and Nevils \u201cdeclined several times,\u201d Farrow writes, according to Variety.\n\nNevils \u201cwas in the midst of telling him she wasn\u2019t interested again when he \u2018just did it,\u2019\u201d Farrow goes on, Variety reported. He allegedly did not use lubricant, and Nevils ended up crying into a pillow. She also reportedly ended up bleeding for days.\n\n\u201cIt was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,\u201d Nevils reportedly told Farrow. \u201cIt was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\u201d\n\nWhen they returned to the United States, Nevils says she had more sexual encounters with Lauer, for which she blames herself and which she calls \u201ccompletely transactional.\u201d She reportedly feared Lauer\u2019s ability to impact her career.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Lauer said the encounter in Sochi was consensual, and described his ensuing relationship with Nevils as a months-long affair that ended when Lauer stopped communicating with her. Nevils tried to rekindle the affair, Lauer said, but didn\u2019t indicate to him that she found their relationship to be nonconsensual. He said he didn\u2019t review Nevils\u2019 work, and she worked in a separate part of the network.\n\n\u201cThere was absolutely nothing aggressive about that encounter\u201d in Sochi, Lauer said in his Variety letter. \u201cBrooke did not do or say anything to object. She certainly did not cry. She was a fully enthusiastic and willing partner. At no time did she behave in a way that made it appear she was incapable of consent.\u201d\n\nNevils eventually told Veira her account, after the #MeToo movement broke in 2017, and Veira urged her to file a formal complaint, Variety reported. But after Lauer was fired, Nevils says she found out that NBC News\u2019 president and chairman were \"emphasizing that the incident had not been 'criminal' or an 'assault.'\"\n\n\"Matt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time,\u201d NBC News said in a statement after Variety\u2019s report was published. \u201cThat\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague.\"\n\nMultiple women have accused Lauer of sexual harassment, including reportedly giving a female colleague a sex toy as a present \u2014 alongside a note detailing how he wanted to use it on her \u2014 and showing another his penis.\n\n\n\nCover: In this Friday, March 29, 2013, file photo, Matt Lauer, co-host of the NBC \"Today\" television program, appears during a segment of the show in New York's Rockefeller Center.
