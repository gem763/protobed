Against a basket of\n\ncurrencies the dollar hit a one-week low of 98.390.\n\nThe British parliament voted on Wednesday to prevent Johnson\n\nfrom taking Britain out of the European Union without a deal on\n\nOct. 31, but rejected his first bid to call a snap election two\n\nweeks before the scheduled exit. \"While there is no 'all clear' on market concerns, investor\n\nsentiment pulled back from extremes,\" said Michael McCarthy,\n\nchief market strategist at brokerage CMC Markets in Sydney.\n\n\"Currency markets illustrated the shift...the U.S. dollar\n\nplayed a passive role as markets wait for the next trade tweets\n\nto drop.\"\n\nThe Canadian dollar spiked sharply to C$1.3344 per\n\ndollar after the Bank of Canada left interest rates on hold and\n\nsounded less dovish than the market had expected.\n\nThe more upbeat mood cautiously held in morning trade in\n\nAsia, though few expected it to last long.\n\nBrexit is still up in the air, with possible outcomes\n\nranging from a no-deal exit from the EU to abandoning the whole\n\nendeavour.\n\n\"It's important to keep in mind that the situation\n\ncontinues to look pretty bad,\" J.P. Morgan analysts reminded\n\ninvestors in a market note, pointing out that Johnson is pushing\n\nfor a snap election and a so-called \"hard Brexit\" remains an\n\noption.\n\nThe weak global trade outlook is also still a key worry,\n\nwith U.S. President Donald Trump warning on Tuesday he would be\n\n\"tougher\" on Beijing in a second term if talks dragged on.\n\nAnd it was not clear whether Hong Kong would return to calm\n\nafter leader Carrie Lam withdraw an extradition bill that\n\ntriggered months of often violent protests. That caution kept the yen's losses reasonably\n\nmuted, though it did drift a little further lower to 106.42\n\nper-dollar, its cheapest since Friday.\n\nThe yuan held on to Wednesday's gains at around\n\n7.1487 per dollar in offshore trade.\n\nChina will implement both broad and targeted cuts in the\n\nreserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks \"in a timely manner,\"\n\nChina's cabinet said in a meeting on Wednesday, an indication\n\nthat a cut in the key ratio aimed at boosting lending could be\n\nimminent. \"A drop in geopolitical risk premium comes as a welcome\n\nrelief,\" said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at\n\nAxiTrader.\n\n\"But with the omnipresent trade war clouds looming ominously\n\nover the market threatening to come thundering down at any time,\n\nthe air remains thick with caution.\"", "description": "FOREX-Pound at week-high, dollar sinks as risk-on mood cautiously holds", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/eur_usd_800x533_L_1411988069.jpg"}
