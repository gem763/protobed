The blast came right after Jarrod Dyson sprinted home with the game-tying run, beating the throw from Manny Machado after an infield chopper.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way we\u2019ve set out to play ever since spring,\u201d Dyson said. \u201cYou set your goals to make it to the playoffs, but if you don\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t mean you tank it.\u201d\n\nArizona trailed 3-2 going into the eighth inning, but Dyson, who was pinch running, broke for home on a bouncing ball to Machado. He dove head first into home plate, just getting his hand in before the tag. Dyson was originally ruled out, but the call was reversed by the umpires after a video review.\n\n\u201cI thought I got my hand in there,\u201d Dyson said. \u201cThe ball might have beat me, but he tagged me up high and I was able to squeeze my hand in there even though I didn\u2019t have much plate to work with.\u201d\n\nLamb came up next and put the game out of reach with his sixth homer of the season. He entered the game hitting just .186.\n\n\u201cTo see that big smile on his face, it was worth it,\u201d Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. \u201cNothing better for me this entire day. He works as hard as anybody to make good outcomes happen. He hasn\u2019t had a lot of luck or good outcomes. But I know he\u2019s going to sleep well tonight, helping us win a baseball game.\u201d\n\nLuis Perdomo (2-4) took the loss after giving up four runs in the eighth.\n\n\u201cToday it was just that lead-off walk,\u201d San Diego interim manager Rod Barajas said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to give up any free passes. He is not a punch out pitcher. You give up lead off walks bad things happen.\n\nRobby Scott (1-0) pitched an inning of scoreless relief for the win. Archie Bradley earned his 18th save.\n\nIt was the Diamondbacks\u2018 second impressive win in four days. Arizona beat St. Louis 3-2 in 19 innings on Tuesday when Ildemaro Vargas hit a game-tying homer in the ninth inning and a game-winning single in the 19th.\n\nOn Friday, San Diego jumped ahead 1-0 in the first inning when Eric Hosmer\u2019s sacrifice fly scored Greg Garcia.\n\nThe lead stood until the fifth when Arizona scored two runs, including one when Christian Walker drew a bases-loaded walk.\n\nSan Diego tied the game at 2-all in the sixth when Machado - who had three hits - launched a solo homer over the right field fence. The Padres went ahead in the seventh when Luis Urias\u2019 double down the right-field line scored Luis Torrens.\n\nSan Diego starter Eric Lauer gave up two runs in 4 2/3 innings, striking out eight. The Padres lost for the 13th time in 15 games.\n\nArizona clinched a third-straight winning season on Wednesday by beating the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nBONK\n\nArizona\u2019s Tim Locastro was hit by a pitch on Friday for the 22nd time this season. That ranks fourth all-time for a player in his rookie season.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nDiamondbacks: RHP Taijuan Walker is expected to make his first start in the season\u2019s final game. Walker hasn\u2019t pitched since April 2018, after Tommy John surgery and then a shoulder injury. Manager Torey Lovullo said he expects Walker will pitch one inning and then likely be relieved by LHP Alex Young. \u2026 OF Abraham Almonte won\u2019t play in the season\u2019s final series because of a hamstring injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPadres: San Diego will start RHP Garrett Richards (0-1, 11.81 ERA). He\u2019ll be making his third start since coming off the injured list earlier this month.\n\nDiamondbacks: Arizona will start LHP Robbie Ray (12-8, 4.28). He\u2019ll be making his career-high 33rd start of the season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Arizona Diamondbacks came up with another impressive win despite being eliminated from the National League playoff hunt earlier this week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Brandt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/padres_diamondbacks_baseball_67168_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
