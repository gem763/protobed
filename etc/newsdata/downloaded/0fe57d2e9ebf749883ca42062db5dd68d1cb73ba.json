The Kurds fought alongside American forces to drive ISIS fighters out of their strongholds in northern Syria. President Trump ordered U.S. troops, which have numbered around 1,000 in the area, to move out ahead of Turkey's offensive. Turkey said it was trying to establish a terrorist-free corridor on its border. Kurdish commanders said they might have to abandon prisons holding ISIS fighters and focus on fighting back against Turkey. [The Washington Post]\n\n2.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden broke his silence on House Democrats' impeachment inquiry on Wednesday, saying Trump had \"already convicted himself in full view of the world and the American people\" by refusing to cooperate with Congress. \"Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation, and committed impeachable acts,\" Biden said. \"To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached.\" Previously, Biden had only said Trump \"could be impeached,\" but declined to make \"that judgment now.\" Trump responded on Twitter, calling Biden's comments \"pathetic\" and saying the only reason Biden was speaking out now was that polls were showing him losing his status as frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Biden quickly responded, \"Thanks for watching. Stop stonewalling the Congress. Honor your oath. Respect the Constitution.\" [ABC News, CBS News]\n\n3.\n\nPresident Trump asked then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to help get the Justice Department to drop a criminal case against one of Rudy Giuliani's clients in 2017, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing three people familiar with the matter. Tillerson said he couldn't because that would be interfering in an ongoing investigation. After the Oval Office meeting, Tillerson told then-Chief of Staff John Kelly doing what Trump asked would be illegal. The White House declined to comment. Giuliani, a longtime Trump supporter, is now Trump's personal lawyer, but wasn't at the time. Giuliani's client was Iranian-Turkish gold trader Reza Zarrab, who was facing charges of dodging U.S. sanctions against Iran's nuclear program. Prosecutors said he had \"close ties\" with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. [Bloomberg]\n\n4.\n\nThe United Nations warned Wednesday that it soon will run out of money to pay staff and bills unless member nations that have failed to make their contributions pay up. The U.S., the largest contributor to the world body, owes the U.N. $674 million for this year, and another $381 million in back payments, according to America's U.N. mission. President Trump brushed off calls for the U.S. to make its contributions, tweeting: \"So make all Member Countries pay, not just the United States!\" The U.N. said 129 of its 193 members had paid their annual dues. The organization has brought in nearly $2 billion this year, with a total outstanding balance of $1.3 billion. [USA Today]\n\n5.\n\nTwo people were fatally shot near a synagogue and a kebab shop in Halle, Germany, on Wednesday. The attacker apparently livestreamed the shooting in a video that started with the man denying the Holocaust and blaming social problems on Jews. Police said the suspected attacker fled by car. A witness said one the assailant, wearing a helmet and a military jacket, threw what appeared to be a grenade at the door of the kebab shop and fired at least one shot at the restaurant. \"All the customers next to me ran, of course I did too,\" said the witness, Conrad Roessler. \"The man behind me probably died.\" The shooting occurred on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year in Judaism and one of the busiest for synagogues. [The Associated Press, The Washington Post]\n\n6.\n\nChinese organizers on Wednesday canceled a fan event ahead of a Thursday National Basketball Association exhibition game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers in Shanghai. The move was the latest in a flurry of retaliation by China after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for anti-government protesters in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver later expressed support for Morey's right to express his views. The Shanghai Sports Federation said it scrapped the event because of the \"inappropriate attitude\" demonstrated by Morey and Silver. Other sponsors and broadcasters also have distanced themselves from the NBA in China, a key international market for the U.S. professional basketball league.
