(AP)\n\nTrevor Siemian\u2019s first start with the New York Jets didn\u2019t last long.\n\nSiemian was starting for Sam Darnold, who is out with mono. In the second quarter, Siemian suffered an injury that looked serious, though he was able to walk off the field after trainers looked at him.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nSiemian threw deep and was hit by Myles Garrett as he threw. Garrett landed on Siemian, whose left foot was trapped underneath him. His leg bent in a way that it shouldn\u2019t. Garrett was called for roughing the passer on the play because he landed on the quarterback. We saw that call a couple times on Sunday too.\n\nSiemian limped back tot the locker room as Luke Falk took over the Jets offense.\n\nThe Jets were horrific on offense before and after Siemian\u2019s injury. They finished the first half with minus-13 net passing yards. Josh Bellamy topped off a horrible first half by dropping an easy pass over thee middle in the final minute.\n\nHere\u2019s the Siemian injury, which isn\u2019t for the squeamish:\n\nOh man that is painful looking for Trevor Siemian. pic.twitter.com/6tm5IWZv6s \u2014 Will Brinson (@WillBrinson) September 17, 2019\n\nThe Jets could be without Darnold for a while, and if Siemian\u2019s injury is serious they could be going forward with their third quarterback of the season for a while.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
