But Lottie's behaviour was outrageous.\n\n'She also made the homophobic comments, which were totally unnecessary. Contestants complained to producers in the house and asked them to look into it.'\n\nContestants are said to have threatened to quit the show because of Lottie's comments. She is pictured above during filming with Lubna\n\nThe source stated that producers would only leave when candidates had gone to bed and were aware of the comments being made.\n\nThey added: 'The racism issue is a big one and it is going to blow up in the show and the BBC's face. It is not going to go away and people are shocked with how it's been handled.'\n\nLottie is said to have rebuked the claims and said they were 'untrue'. But fellow candidate Souleyman Bah claimed 'of course it's true'.\n\nBefore filming starts on the show, contestants are made to sign a form which acknowledges that they will be kicked out for bad behaviour.", "description": "The BBC said they have informed Ms Lion her comments about Mahatma Gandhi, who led the fight for India's independence, were 'wholly unacceptable'.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/16/20186482-0-image-a-31_1572017303527.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
