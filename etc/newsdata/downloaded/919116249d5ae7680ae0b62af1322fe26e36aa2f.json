Corbin struck out Edman, sending a roar through a packed house of 43,976 on their feet from the opening pitch.\n\nCorbin then struck out Jose Martinez and Paul Goldschmidt \u2014 13 pitches, 11 strikes, and with each punch out the crowd grew louder and louder.\n\nThey would soon find a new level of frenzy.\n\nTrea Turner led off the bottom of the first with a single to right, and when Adam Eaton followed with a double to center, Nationals Park exploded. Those few fans who had not reached their seats yet ran across the center field concourse. The deafening noise told them they were missing something special.\n\nNot to worry \u2014 the Nationals lineup was just getting started.\n\nAs chants of \u201cMVP, MVP\u201d rang into the night, Anthony Rendon brought Washington\u2019s first run home with a sacrifice fly to center.\n\nJuan Soto followed with a double to left, scoring Eaton for a 2-0 lead.\n\nWhen Howie Kendrick came to the plate, the crowd anticipated something special from their offensive hero of this series, coming off his three-RBI performance in Monday night\u2019s 8-1 win.\n\nCardinals starter Dakota Hudson disappointed the home crowd with an intentional walk.\n\nBut the Cardinals were imploding as Nationals Park was exploding.\n\nRyan Zimmerman reached first on an error by second baseman Kollen Wong, then Victor Robles drove home Soto with a single to right.\n\nYan Gomes kept the line moving, singling to left, driving home Kendrick and Zimmerman. Corbin sacrificed, moving Gomes to scoring position at second and Turner, batting for the second time, drove the ball into left field for a two-run single, scoring Robles and Gomes.\n\nThe score was 7-0 Washington after just one inning.\n\nFun times. Serious fun times.\n\nThis had been manager Dave Martinez\u2019s message to his team during their steamrolling playoff run, from the wild card game victory over Milwaukee to the NL Division Series win over the favored Los Angeles Dodgers to last night\u2019s clincher in the NLCS against St. Louis.\n\n\u201cI want them to have fun,\u201d Martinez said before the game of his expectations for his players. \u201cI want them to be loose. Like I said before, we\u2019re not here solving the world\u2019s problems. We\u2019re here playing a baseball game. Some of you guys have done it since you were 3, 4 years old. So just go out there and have fun.\u201d\n\nThat message had reached the crowd.\n\nGrown men and women wearing full-length Baby Shark costumes certainly qualifies as fun. The fun came to a crescendo when Robles ran down Edman\u2019s fly ball to center for the final out, kicking off a raucous celebration in the stands and on the field, where Nationals players jumped on each other near the mound and embraced with the hugs of a champion.\n\nFans waved their red Nats rally towels and stomped and screamed the night away like it was 1933 \u2014 the last time a Washington team played in the World Series.\n\nThey stomped and screamed away the pain of losing not one, but two baseball teams, and the void of not having Washington baseball for 34 years until this franchise, the former Montreal Expos, moved to the District in 2005.\n\nThey stomped and screamed most of the night for the joy, the pride and the unity that the Nationals brought to the city this October. And they stomped and screamed for what was still to come \u2014 the World Series.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
