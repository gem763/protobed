This weekly mask combines clarifying clay with spinach, spirulina and green tea extracts.\n\nWhile Dr Palm acknowledges that \u201chow many steps in a routine is really up to the motivation of the patient,\u201d she told The Independent that the two steps that should never be skipped are morning sunscreen application, and washing your face at least once daily.\n\nAccording to Dr Palm, sunscreen is the \u201cmost important skincare product\u201d because it prevents premature ageing. She also added that some sunscreens can promote skin-ageing reversal and reduce oxidative damage to the skin - so it is worth finding a formula that has what you are looking for.\n\nDaily washing is integral because it cleans your face of any dirt, debris and environmental pollutants, while also preparing skin for topical skincare application.\n\nHowever, for those who are able to dedicate more time and energy to their routine, Dr Palm advises patients follow a foundational pyramid of skincare.\n\n\u201cI think of skincare products in category, on a sort of pyramid of skincare products - the base or foundation being the most important, with layers of other products rising to the top of the pinnacle in lessening importance,\u201d she told us.\n\nStep three\n\nAfter sunscreen - the \u201cmost foundational step\u201d - and washing, Dr Palm recommends a vitamin A derivative applied topically, either a retinol or retinoids.\n\nAccording to Dr Palm, vitamin A should be used because of the \u201cfour decades of research to back up\u201d the various positive effects it has on the skin.\n\nThese include \"thickening the dermis by building new collagen, improving fine lines, decreasing skin pigmentation irregularities, helping other topical active ingredients penetrate more effectively, preventing pre-cancerous spots, and preparing skin to heal faster from certain laser procedures and deeper chemical peels\".\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
