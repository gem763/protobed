Easy, just go and get him. He'd score 20 goals a season for you with his eyes closed,\" said Keane.\n\nSolskjaer lauded Kane as \"one of the best\" when he was asked about Keane's comments ahead of his side's clash with Red Star Belgrade.\n\nBut former Tottenham midfielder Jamie O'Hara believes it would be a step down for Kane to join United, and instead can see him moving to the other side of Manchester.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\n(Image: Sky Sports)\n\nHe said on talkSPORT: \u201cIf you are going to go for \u00a3200million, are you going to go to Man United?\n\nNo disrespect to them, even though they\u2019ve had their great history, Tottenham are probably a better suited squad to where they are going.\n\n\u201cSo if he is going to leave Tottenham, surely he is going to go where he can win trophies. And, for me, that is not going to be at Man United.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cI think if he is going to go it\u2019s going to be Man City; it\u2019s only Man City, for me, who can probably get him.\n\n\u201c[Sergio] Aguero is coming to the end and [Gabriel] Jesus is a different type of player, so if they are to get somebody it would be Harry Kane.\n\n\u201cBut does he leave Tottenham? And can they let him go? I don\u2019t think they can.\u201d", "description": "Roy Keane suggested former club United should make a move for Harry Kane to solve their striking problems", "authors": ["Liam Prenderville", "Image", "Empics Sport", "Sky Sports", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20715104.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Tottenham-Hotspur-v-Red-Star-Belgrade-UEFA-Champions-League-Group-B-Tottenham-Hotspur-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
