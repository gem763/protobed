But the FDA approved Descovy for use only in men and transgender women, because its maker, Gilead Sciences, tested it only in those groups.\n\nThe approval explicitly excludes women and does not outline a plan for making the drug available to them. Some activists and scientists said the approval sets a dangerous precedent by allowing companies to dodge expensive trials needed to test medicines in women.\n\nSuch an exclusion of women \u201cshould be unacceptable in these days and times,\u201d said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nIt\u2019s important to test the drug specifically in women, she added, because Descovy may work differently in the vagina than in rectal tissues.\n\nThe FDA, in fact, will require Gilead to study Descovy in women, company officials said. Gilead is considering a trial in Africa.\n\nGilead also makes Truvada. Both medicines are to be taken daily, an HIV-prevention strategy called preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP.\n\nThe company has come under heavy criticism for selling Truvada at a high cost, currently about $20,000 a year. Critics have said the expense keeps the drug out of reach of Americans who would benefit from it. Few patients actually pay the full price, Gilead has said.\n\nLess expensive generic versions of Truvada are expected next year, as the drug\u2019s patent protections expire. But Descovy\u2019s approval ensures Gilead\u2019s continued dominance of the market for PrEP, said Jeremiah Johnson, a project director at Treatment Action Group, an advocacy organization.\n\nDescovy is not more effective than Truvada, Johnson noted. But in various presentation materials, Gilead on occasion has hinted that it is, and Johnson and others fear patients may reject affordable and accessible generic versions of Truvada in favor of the more expensive Descovy.\n\nAny suggestion that Descovy is more effective than Truvada was unintentional, said Diana Brainard, who oversees Gilead\u2019s HIV division. The company\u2019s message, she added, is that both Descovy and Truvada are highly effective at preventing HIV infection when taken daily.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to have choice,\u201d she said.\n\nDescovy\u2019s patent is supposed to expire in 2026, but a nonprofit group called Prep4All Collaboration hopes to find a way to end it in 2022.\n\nThe group had been running a campaign called \u201cBreak the Patent\u201d to limit Truvada\u2019s patent protection, which was supposed to expire in 2021. But in May, Gilead announced that a generic version would be available next year.\n\n\u201cAs of today, we\u2019re adding an \u2018s\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s \u2018Break the Patents,\u2019 \u201d said Peter Staley, a founder of the collaboration.\n\nDescovy contains a newer version of tenofovir, the active ingredient in Truvada. Gilead tested Descovy in a multinational trial that included 5,313 men and 74 transgender women who have sex with men. There were no cisgender women, and 84% of the participants were white.\n\n\u201cThey did a terrible job of inclusion for a company that dominates the market,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThere are some data suggesting that Descovy has fewer side effects on bones and kidneys than Truvada, but those problems have only been seen in a small number of people taking Truvada, Walensky said.\n\nShe also noted that although Gilead scientists have presented some of their data at conferences, they have yet to publish their results in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nAt a hearing in August, some activists urged the FDA to deny approval for use of Descovy in women or to require Gilead to test the drug in a large number of women promptly after approval.\n\nUnless forced to do so by the FDA, critics said, the company has no motivation to test the drug in women.\n\n\u201cWe had at least hoped that they would say something the day they approved it without an indication for women, that they would have a plan or forceful language laid out on how this disgraceful situation is going to be rectified,\u201d Staley said.\n\nAlthough the FDA\u2019s announcement does not mention it, the agency is requiring such a study.\n\nBrainard said Gilead plans to start the study in at least 1,500 high-risk women in southern Africa \u2014 where the incidence of HIV in women is higher than in the United States \u2014 by the end of 2020. The FDA\u2019s approval letter requires the company to complete the trial by December 2024.\n\nWalensky said she is disappointed by the numbers and timeline of that trial.\n\n\u201cI want to see a large-scale, rapid effort to get data in women as soon as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cThat, in my mind, is the only way to rectify this.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved a new drug, Descovy, for prevention of infection with HIV, only the second drug approved for this purpose.The first, Truvada, has become a mainstay of government efforts to turn back the HIV epidemic.
