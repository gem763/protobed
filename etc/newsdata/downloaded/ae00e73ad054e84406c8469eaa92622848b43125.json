He avoided being expelled but was \"gated\" - banned from the leaving the college grounds - for a week.\n\nTalking gay marriage with Samantha\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Cameron would regularly discuss gay marriage with his wife Samantha\n\nThe former PM writes in his memoirs that his wife had helped convince him to come out in support of gay marriage - an issue he would \"worry and even wobble over\".\n\nHe said Samantha Cameron would argue: \"It's not going to make me feel any less married if two gay people want to get married.\"\n\nMr Cameron says legalising gay marriage is \"one of things of which I'm proudest\", adding it was one of the most contentious, hard-fought and divisive issues during his time as PM.\n\nBut he insists it was his wife who made him realise he was being a \"circle-squaring policy wonk\" focusing on the practical details when he says he should have been looking at the bigger picture of people being able to marry \"the person they love\".\n\nSkip Twitter post by @David_Cameron For 3 years I have kept relatively quiet about politics. But I think it\u2019s right former PMs write their memoirs, to explain what they did and why. For the Record is out Thursday.
