Major YouTubers \u2014 including Mark Rober (8.7M subscribers), Rhett & Link (4.5M), Marshmello (40.2M), iJustine (6.1M), Marques Brownlee (9.5M), The Slow Mo Guys (13M), Ninja (22.4M), Simone Giertz (1.9M), Jacksepticeye (22.9M), Smarter Every Day (7.3M), and more \u2014 are all lending their channels to the cause. Donaldson has invited any other YouTuber who\u2019s interested to join in, too. He described the effort as the \u201clargest youtube collaboration of all time.\u201d\n\nThe plan is simple: YouTubers will begin posting videos this afternoon using the initiative\u2019s hashtag \u2014 #TeamTrees \u2014 and asking viewers to donate to the cause. YouTube will cover all transaction fees for donations made on the platform, the company confirmed. The goal is to flood YouTube with fundraising videos, gaming the algorithm to try to place as many videos about the subject of climate change on the platform\u2019s Trending page as possible and even dominate people\u2019s homepages and recommendations.\n\nThe initiative started in May 2019 when Donaldson\u2019s fans on YouTube, Reddit, and Twitter suggested he plant 20 million trees to celebrate reaching 20 million subscribers. It\u2019s the type of challenge that Donaldson has built his YouTube career on, often partaking in grand-scale challenges and charitable acts that result in tens of millions of people watching his videos. Donaldson says he and some friends tried to see how many trees they could plant on their own, and they only managed to plant 300 in one day.\n\n\u201cWe want to show that YouTube isn\u2019t just a drama fest,\u201d Donaldson said in a private video for YouTubers, seen by The Verge. \u201cWe actually have real influence and can make real change.\u201d\n\nDonaldson teamed up with the Arbor Day Foundation, one of the largest nonprofit conservation organizations dedicated to planting and nurturing trees, to launch the #TeamTrees challenge. The Arbor Day Foundation is already in the middle of its own tree-planting challenge, with the goal of planting 100 million trees by 2022.\n\n\u201cWe know that 20 million trees isn\u2019t going to cure climate change,\u201d Mark Rober, a former NASA engineer and current YouTuber involved in the event, said in a private planning video. \u201cBut the point here is to end the decade on a super strong note. It\u2019s a constructive way to send a message to the politicians that it\u2019s freaking time to do something about climate change.\u201d\n\nTrees will start to be planted in January 2020, according to an FAQ for the project. The goal is to have all 20 million trees planted \u201cno later than December 2022.\u201d The FAQ also states that the Arbor Day Foundation \u201calways emphasizes planting native species where local conditions and forest plans allow.\u201d This means many of the trees will be planted in National Parks around the United States, though the foundation also plants internationally.", "description": "More than 600 YouTubers are teaming up to take on one of the biggest fundraising challenges the platform has ever seen: raising $20 million by the end of the year to plant 20 million trees.
