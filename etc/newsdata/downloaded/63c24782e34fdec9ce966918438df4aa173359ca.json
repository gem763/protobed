REUTERS/Carlos Jasso\n\nMarket watchers, credit ratings agencies and investors will pore over the budget proposal when Finance Ministry officials present it to the Lower House of Congress on Sunday evening for guidance on President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s spending priorities for Latin America\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nFinance Minister Arturo Herrera previewed the budget blueprint on Saturday by highlighting three priorities he said will see more funding: social welfare programs, the new National Guard security force as well as heavily indebted state oil firm Pemex.\n\n\u201cIt will be an extraordinarily responsible budget,\u201d he said, stressing that the government is being careful with public spending.\n\n\u201cWe recognize the limits of fiscal policy.\u201d\n\nMexico\u2019s central bank, meanwhile, has underscored in its most recent statements that next year\u2019s budget must \u201cgenerate confidence.\u201d\n\nLopez Obrador, a leftist nationalist who won a landslide election victory last year, has promised another austere spending plan with no new taxes, tax increases or gasoline price spikes beyond inflation.\n\nBut the government has limited room to cut from programs after it reduced funding for several ministries in order to centralize spending, fight public sector corruption and honor a campaign pledge to implement fiscal austerity in its first budget in December.\n\nMexico\u2019s hospitals, the immigration service and shelters for victims of domestic violence were among the services hit by the steep budget cuts.\n\n\u201cWe have to recognize that we have a serious income problem, we have the decision and commitment of maintaining a surplus, of fulfilling the financial obligations of the Mexican state,\u201d said Alfonso Ramirez Cuellar, who chairs the budget committee in the Lower House.\n\nFalling oil production and prices, as well declining resources from income and value-added taxes as Mexico\u2019s economy barely escaped entering a recession, have meant lower government resources, said Ramirez Cuellar, who is also a member of Lopez Obrador\u2019s leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA).\n\nHe said the government\u2019s spending priorities next year will include the key energy sector, health, education and beefing up the National Guard, a new security force created by Lopez Obrador to bring down record homicide rates.\n\nALL EYES ON THE FISCAL SURPLUS\n\nSecurity Minister Alfonso Durazo has said he expected the budget to set aside 56 billion pesos ($2.87 billion) for the National Guard.\n\nThe National Guard has placated President Donald Trump by patrolling the border to stem the flow of U.S.-bound migrants, down 56% between May and August, according to Mexican government figures on Friday.\n\nOther spending priorities will likely include infrastructure projects such as a new refinery, the so-called Mayan Train project and transfers to state-owned oil company Pemex.\n\nOne of the most salient measures of Lopez Obrador\u2019s commitment to fiscal responsibility will be the primary fiscal surplus targeted for next year.\n\nTo keep markets happy, the primary fiscal surplus needs to be above 0.5% of GDP, since going below that \u201cwould signal a weakening commitment to fiscal discipline,\u201d according to Alberto Ramos, head of Latin American research at Goldman Sachs in New York.\n\nA preliminary budget forecast sent to lawmakers in April forecast a primary surplus of 1.3% of GDP for 2020.\n\n\u201cWe have to keep looking for ways to stabilize the debt trajectory. We have to have some level of primary surplus and we have to look for sources so that income continues to grow,\u201d Herrera said.\n\nRamirez Cuellar said the primary surplus would hover around 1%.\n\nIf the budget ultimately targets that level, \u201cthat wouldn\u2019t be a disaster, though, since two consecutive years of primary surpluses is good going, particularly for a left-wing government,\u201d said Edward Glossop, emerging market economist at Capital Economics.", "description": "The Mexican government's 2020 budget will have to strike a careful balance, weighing the realities of slowing economic growth and dwindling income with commitments to fiscal discipline.", "authors": ["Anthony Esposito", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427487682&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF87054", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
