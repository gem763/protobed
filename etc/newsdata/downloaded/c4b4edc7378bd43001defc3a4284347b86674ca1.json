PCG, +0.73% into bankruptcy and forced it to take more aggressive steps to prevent blazes.\n\nThe drastic measure caused long lines at supermarkets and hardware stores as people rushed to buy ice, coolers, flashlights and batteries across a swath of Northern California. Cars backed up at traffic lights that had gone dark. Schools and universities canceled classes. And many businesses closed.\n\nMost of downtown Sonoma was pitch black when Joseph Pokorski, a retiree, showed up for his morning ritual of drinking coffee, followed by beer and cocktails.\n\nThe Town Square bar was open and lit by lanterns but coffee was out of the question and only cash was accepted. Pokorski decided to forgo a 30-minute wait for a cup of joe from the bakery next door and move on to beers and a couple greyhound cocktails of vodka and grapefruit juice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a coffee freak,\u201d Pokorski said. \u201cI can take it or leave. It\u2019s no big thing.\u201d\n\nCustomers at Friedman\u2019s Home Improvement store were guided by employees with flashlights and head lamps to snatch up batteries, power cords and other necessities to get them through possibly several days without power.\n\nWith the sun shining outdoors, not a wisp of smoke in the air and only gentle breezes, the action was condemned by many of those whose lives were inconvenienced.\n\nContractor Rick Lachmiller who was buying extension cords for his generator, was upset and said he felt PG&E jumped the gun on the outage, since it wasn\u2019t windy Wednesday morning, and didn\u2019t provide enough warning.\n\n\u201cPeople have refrigerators full of food,\u201d he said. \u201cIt leaves this whole community scrambling around trying to save their food or their job or whatever it is.\u201d\n\nMore than 500,000 customers in Northern California were without power, the utility said, and about 300,000 more outages were planned later Wednesday to prevent its equipment from sparking wildfires during winds forecast to build. About 2 million people were expected to be affected for up to several days.\n\n\u201cTo everyone asking, \u2018Where\u2019s the wind? Where\u2019s the wind?\u2019 Don\u2019t worry, the wind is coming,\u201d said Steve Anderson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. \u201cObviously PG&E doesn\u2019t want to cut the power when there\u2019s already strong winds. You want to cut the power before it happens.\u201d\n\nGusts of 35 mph to 45 mph were forecast to sweep from the San Francisco Bay Area to the agricultural Central Valley and especially in the Sierra Nevada foothills, where a November wildfire blamed on PG&E transmission lines killed 85 people and virtually incinerated the town of Paradise.\n\nThe cutbacks were deemed a last resort and followed a plan instituted after the Paradise inferno and several other blazes blamed on PG&E equipment that forced the utility into bankruptcy over an estimated $30 billion in potential damages from lawsuits.\n\nPG&E has cut power several times this year and deliberate outages could become the new normal in an era in which scientists say climate change is leading to fiercer blazes and longer fire seasons.\n\nVery few fires were currently burning in California on Wednesday. Only a tiny fraction of acreage has burned, so far, this year compared to recent years though no one has attributed that to the power cuts.\n\nThe utility planned to shut off power in parts of 34 counties to reduce the chance of fierce winds knocking down or toppling trees into power lines during a siege of dry, gusty weather.\n\nOutages weren\u2019t limited to fire-prone areas because the utilities must turn off entire distribution and transmission lines to much wider areas to minimize the risk of wildfires.\n\nBefore the lights were supposed to go out in the East Bay town of Moraga, cars queued up at gas stations and customers filled carts at the town\u2019s only supermarket with bags of ice, canned goods, loaves of bread, breakfast cereal and water.\n\nLines were also long at pharmacies and hardware stores, where emergency supplies were running low.\n\n\u201cDo you have any lanterns?\u201d Elma Lear asked at Moraga Hardware and Lumber. \u201cOr candles?\u201d\n\nThe store, which sold 500 flashlights Tuesday, was out of both and had also run out of batteries and coolers \u2014 even ultra-pricey Yeti coolers that cost as much as $400, owner Bill Snider said.\n\nLear, who had stocked up on nonperishable food, cash and filled her gas tank, was directed to a home decor shop nearby where she had to fork over $40 for long lasting beeswax candles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to bite the bullet,\u201d she said.\n\nThe outages came as residents in the region\u2019s wine country north of San Francisco marked the two-year anniversary of deadly wildfires that killed 44 and destroyed thousands of homes. San Francisco is the only county in the nine-county Bay Area where power will not be affected by blackouts.\n\nIt could take as many as five days to restore power after the danger has passed because every inch of power line must be checked by helicopter and ground crews to make sure it isn\u2019t damaged or in danger of sparking a blaze, PG&E said.\n\n\u201cIf there is damage, that could possibly extend the length of the outage,\u201d said PG&E spokesman Mark Mesesan. \u201cBut we will not restore power until it\u2019s absolutely safe to do so.\u201d\n\nTo the south, Southern California Edison was considering power shut-offs to nearly 174,000 customers in nine counties as Santa Ana winds were predicted Thursday. San Diego Gas & Electric has notified about 30,000 customers they could lose power in backcountry areas.\n\nClasses were canceled for thousands of schoolchildren and at the University of California, Berkeley, Sonoma State University and Mills College.\n\nHospitals would operate on backup power, but other systems could see their generators fail after a few days. Outages even posed a threat that fire hydrants wouldn\u2019t work at a time of extreme fire danger.\n\nCounties activated their emergency centers and authorities urged people to have supplies of water for several days, to keep sensitive medicines such as insulin in cool places, to drive carefully because traffic lights could be out, to have a full gas tank for emergencies and to check the food in freezers and refrigerators for spoilage after power is restored.\n\nPG&E set up about 30 community centers offering air conditioning, restrooms, bottled water and electronic charging stations during daylight hours.\n\nIn the El Dorado Hills east of Sacramento, California, Ruth Self and her son were taking an outage in stride after stocking up with supplies at a Safeway grocery store.\n\nSelf said she wasn\u2019t upset, given the lives lost nearly a year ago in Paradise, invoking images of people who burned in their cars trying to escape.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully (the outages) are only for a couple days. I think it\u2019s more of a positive than a negative. Ask me again on Friday night when I haven\u2019t had a shower in two days, when I\u2019ve had to spend two days playing card games.\u201d", "description": "More than a million people in California were without electricity Wednesday as the state\u2019s largest utility pulled the plug to prevent a repeat of the past...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT008_blacko_ZG_20191009203346.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
