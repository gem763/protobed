The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d In audio obtained by the Los Angeles Times, members of the audience laughed nervously at the non-joke.\n\nOf course, neither the whistle-blower nor his sources are anywhere near the ballpark of treason \u2014 except within the president\u2019s l\u2019etat c\u2019est moi understanding of politics. There is established White House protocol for staffers to listen to the president\u2019s phone conversations, and the 1998 Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act and subsequent protections are in place specifically to protect intelligence officers in this very situation. In front of the House, Maguire said that the whistle-blower \u201cdid the right thing\u201d and followed the law \u201cevery step of the way.\u201d (If it makes the whistle-blower feel any better, he\u2019s got a small crowd of peers that Trump has accused of treason: federal law enforcement, Democrats in Congress, and news organizations at large.)\n\nOther targets in Trump\u2019s morning talk included members of the media \u2014 whom he called \u201cscum\u201d and \u201canimals\u201d \u2014 and \u201cSleepy Joe Biden,\u201d whom he called \u201cdumb as a rock.\u201d U.N. staffers who brought their children to the event weren\u2019t thrilled by the president\u2019s language, according to a source who spoke with NBC News, because they were under the impression that the appearance was supposed to be \u201ca family-friendly event \u2026 Instead, the kids there saw Trump talking ominously about treason and spies and how we need to be rougher on people.\u201d Considering the president\u2019s past comments in front of children and his general reputation as the swear-y president, the parents may wish they took greater precautions.", "description": "In a private meeting on Thursday, Trump said the whistle-blower should be punished like \u201cwhat we used to do in the old days\u201d and called journalists \u201canimals\u201d and \u201cscum.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/26/26-trump.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
