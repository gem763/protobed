My mum told me only ever to do things for myself, not for others.\"\n\n(Image: mirror.co.uk)\n\n(Image: Hulton Archive)\n\nAdele first started improving her diet after the birth of her son Angelo in 2012.\n\nFor the sake of her voice, she ditched the 10 cups of sugary tea she used to drink each day and cut out alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine all \"spicy, citrusy, and tangy\" foods.\n\n\"It's f***ing boring, but I don't think you take your voice seriously until you've an accident,\" she told Australia's 60 Minutes of her 2011 vocal hemorrhage.\n\n(Image: Adele/Twitter)\n\n\"I'm frightened all the time I'm going to damage my voice,\" she admitted.\n\nIn 2015 she said she thought she'd been successful because she had a \"relatable\" figure.\n\nShe told Rolling Stone: \"Would I show my body off if I was thinner? Probably not, because my body is mine. But sometimes I'm curious to know if I would have been as successful if I wasn't plus-size. I think I remind everyone of themselves.\"\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBut the following year she was starting to go to the gym more, admitting she wanted to be in shape for her tour following the release of most recent album 25.\n\nBy 2017 she was believed to have lost more than two stone, reportedly due to The Sirtfood Diet, which sees slimmers fill up on plant-based foods like kale, buckwheat, green tea and tumeric.\n\nThe foods are known as sirtuin activators, and are said to control the way the body processes fat and sugar and regulate the appetite in the process.\n\n(Image: FilmMagic)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nGreen tea and cocoa powder are also on the menu, along with red wine and cheese.\n\n\"The Sirtfood Diet is all about losing weight and feeling fantastic through eating great-tasting food,\" a source told the Daily Mail.\n\n\u201cI mainly moan. I\u2019m not, like, skipping to the f-cking gym. I don\u2019t enjoy it,\" she told Rolling Stone in 2016.\n\n\"I do like doing weights. I don\u2019t like looking in the mirror. Blood vessels burst on my face really easily, so I\u2019m so conscious when I\u2019m lifting weights not to let them burst in my face. And if I don\u2019t tour, you\u2019ll catch me back down at the Chinese!\u201d\n\n(Image: Corbis via Getty Images)\n\n\"After Adele started working out, she never looked back,\" the source told PEOPLE.\n\nThey added: \"She was instantly a changed person with a different mindset.\"\n\nAdele reportedly has regular personal trainer sessions and pilate classes, as well as enjoying a Stairmaster-like class called Rise Nation.", "description": "The 31-year-old proudly showed off her weight loss as she attended Drake's birthday party in Hollywood last week", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Mirror.Co.Uk", "Hulton Archive", "Adele Twitter", "Afp Getty Images", "Filmmagic", "Corbis Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20407744.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Mercury-Music-Awards-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
