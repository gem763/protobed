He will be one of the 10 Fed leaders who get to vote on the appropriate level of interest rates in 2020.\n\nFederal Reserve makes a small interest rate cut. Trump slams the central bank for having 'no guts.'\n\nTrump has blasted the Fed as having \u201cno \u2018guts,\u2019 no sense, no vision,\u201d saying it is keeping interest rates too high. He has suggested the central bank should lower rates back to zero, where they were for many years after the 2008 financial crisis. Kashkari, a Republican, said politics play no role in his advocacy for lower rates and that he is advocating only for \u201cmodestly\u201d lower rates.\n\n\u201cI could easily see justifying 50 basis points lower than it is today,\u201d said Kashkari, who has been advocating for lower rates since early 2016, before Trump won the election. But he added, \u201cI hope we don\u2019t end up back at zero.\u201d\n\nU.S. consumers are holding up the economy right now, but there are signs of trouble. Consumer confidence fell more than expected in September as Americans started to balk at the continuing trade war, the Conference Board reported Tuesday.\n\nKashkari is concerned that hiring is slowing this year and that the yield curve inverted in August and is close to doing it again, a situation that has occurred before recessions. He said the Fed has to act before companies stop hiring altogether or begin mass layoffs.\n\n\u201cMonetary policy is a little bit science, but it\u2019s also mass psychology,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now one concern I have is the job market does appear to be slowing. It has stepped down pretty markedly from a year or two ago.\u201d\n\nTrump and his team have placed the blame for the slowing economy and weaker hiring squarely on the Fed, but Kashkari said trade policies are clearly playing a role, along with an aging U.S. population and trouble in the global economy.\n\nU.S. businesses are taking down job listings as Trump's trade war grows\n\nKashkari called the trade war the \u201cbig elephant out there,\u201d one he hears about all the time from farmers, manufacturers and exporters, some of whom tell him they are so nervous about the trade situation that they are not investing or hiring. The Minneapolis Fed region comprises Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and parts of Michigan and Wisconsin, states that are desperate to sell soybeans to China again and see manufacturing get out of a recession.\n\n\u201cI see a growing risk,\u201d Kashkari said. \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s so hard for me to predict whether any kind of a deal will be reached. And will the deal be a real deal or will it be something in name only? I don\u2019t know. It continues to be a big uncertainty.\u201d\n\nMost Fed leaders are hesitant to lower interest rates as much as Kashkari wants. They think the economy is still solid and does not need much stimulus from the central bank. Some have even argued that no additional cuts are needed until there are clear signs of strain in the economy. But Kashkari says if the Fed waits until the economy is clearly in trouble, it will be too late.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re really sure the economy is slowing and that we\u2019re heading into a recession, it\u2019s too late. We will hit a recession,\u201d he said, echoing similar remarks last week by Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell.\n\nPowell said he prefers to act sooner rather than later, since interest rates are low by historical standards and the Fed doesn\u2019t have much room to cut when trouble hits. But Powell has been reluctant to commit to additional rate cuts given how divided the Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee is.\n\nThe other big fear on Wall Street lately is that banks had a high demand last week for overnight loans from the Fed. Banks have not had this much demand for extra reserves since the financial crisis. Kashkari played a large role in addressing the 2008 financial crisis, including administering the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which bought toxic assets to help ensure that banks survived.\n\nKashkari says banks should be required to hold more reserves \u2014 double what they are required to hold now \u2014 but he does not see the recent issues in the overnight lending market as a big problem.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it as a financial stability concern,\u201d he said. Instead, he said, \u201cit probably means we may have to start expanding the balance sheet sooner than we otherwise thought.\u201d\n\nSome on Wall Street have argued for a return of quantitative easing \u2014 where the Fed would buy assets to pump more money into the financial system. Kashkari says what\u2019s needed right now isn\u2019t QE but rather a little more liquidity to ensure the plumbing of financial markets works.\n\nTaylor Telford, Thomas Heath and David J.
