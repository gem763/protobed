The company announced 15 new products, including the Echo Buds truly wireless headphones, the Dolby Atmos-equipped Echo Studio speaker, and the Echo Frames, which have built-in microphones so you can chat with Alexa.\n\nA few of the announcements were minor revisions, like the Echo Dot smart speaker with an integrated clock, and the Alexa Smart Oven that can convection bake and air fry food items (in addition to being a regular microwave). But there were more than a few unexpected surprises, including the Echo Loop smart ring, the new, affordable Eero mesh Wi-Fi router, the Amazon Fetch pet tracker, and more.\n\nUnlike most major hardware events, this one wasn\u2019t streamed live. But you can check out every headline below, ordered from the most recent announcement to the oldest.\n\nThe 15th (!) and final device that Amazon unveiled today is the Echo Loop, a smart ring that nudges you with vibrations. It is built with a titanium frame and looks rather large, though it\u2019s understandable given that it features a haptic engine and two microphones. It will launch for $129. Like the Echo Frames, these will be sold in an invite-only program to start.\n\nThe new Echo Frames look like regular eyeglasses. They don\u2019t have a display or a camera, but they feature discreet microphones so you can chat with Alexa without getting out your phone. These start at $179 and will be released in limited quantity, i.e. invite-only.\n\nAmazon\u2019s first foray into headphones are the Echo Buds. They feature dual armature drivers in each bud, so they should be balanced in sound. Amazon says that they feature five hours of continuous battery life, with up to 20 hours with the included case.\n\nThere\u2019s a big focus on noise isolation, and Amazon incorporated Bose\u2019s smart noise isolation to make it easier to hear what you\u2019re listening to. Surprisingly, these will work with your current voice assistant, whether it\u2019s Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri.\n\nThey\u2019re available for preorder today, shipping in time for the holidays, for $129.\n\nSucceeding last year\u2019s Alexa-powered microwave, Amazon has announced the Alexa Smart Oven. It\u2019s a microwave, and it can also handle convection cooking and air frying. You can even scan barcodes on food items and Alexa will give you suggested cooking times. It\u2019s available for preorder today for $249.99.\n\nThe new Ring indoor camera is available for $59.99 today, and it\u2019s very small. According to Amazon, it can be powered by your wall outlet, and alternatively, it can run on a battery. Importantly, this product supports Alexa\u2019s new \u201cHome mode\u201d that disables video recording at your command.\n\nIf you already have a home security kit installed, and don\u2019t want to ditch it completely, Ring\u2019s new retrofitting alarm kit will supposedly allow you to do that. It\u2019s $199, and it can work with all of your current security infrastructure, including window sensors.\n\nAmazon is taking preorders starting today for Echo Flex, which is Amazon\u2019s smallest Echo device. It plugs directly into a power outlet, and it contains a microphone for Alexa queries and commands. It will cost $24.99, and if you want to add on a motion sensor and nightlight attachment, that costs an extra $14.\n\nThe latest addition to Eero\u2019s lineup of mesh Wi-Fi systems is a product that\u2019s simply called the \u201call-new Eero.\u201d It has a dual-band radio, adaptive backhaul, and you can ask Alexa to pause Wi-Fi going to particular devices, or to activate, say, the guest Wi-Fi network. Amazon touts that it only takes 10 minutes or less to set up this device. It\u2019s $99, and you can order a three pack for $249.\n\nMost Echo products are made for adults, but the Echo Glow is made for kids. It\u2019s a colorful lamp that can blink in patterns, or go into \u201ccampfire\u201d mode to mimic a, well, campfire. It\u2019s available for preorder today for $29.99.\n\nThe Echo Show 8 is Amazon\u2019s latest smart display. As you might have guessed, it has an eight-inch screen and is available for preorder starting today for $129. It complements the Echo Show 5 and Echo Show 10, giving customers yet another sizing option to choose between.\n\nAmazon says that Alexa will be the only voice assistant that can pull contextual information from recipes, and say them out loud so that you don\u2019t need to be glued to the Echo Show\u2019s display.\n\nThe Echo Studio is the latest entry to the Echo smart speaker lineup. It supports Dolby Atmos and 3D audio. Amazon says that it\u2019s the \u201cmost innovative speaker\u201d that it has built. The speaker can adapt its sound output based on the room that it\u2019s placed in. It\u2019s available for preorder today for $199.\n\nThe latest generation of Amazon\u2019s Echo speaker is available for preorder today. Amazon says that it has features found in the more capable Echo Plus, like neodymium drivers, and it has new fabric design colors.\n\nAmazon will debut new voices for Alexa, including Samuel L. Jackson, and yes, there\u2019s an explicit version of his voice that incorporates swears. Jackson is the first celebrity to have his voice used in Amazon\u2019s \u201cneural text-to-speech,\u201d so no matter what you ask your smart speaker, it should sound just like the celebrity.\n\nAmazon says that the most frequently asked query from Echo Dot users is \u201cwhat time is it?,\u201d so it\u2019s addressing those needs with the new Echo Dot. It has the time integrated into the fabric that surrounds the speaker. It\u2019s available starting today for $59. Amazon says that the older Echo Dot will remain on sale.\n\nIn addition to allowing users to switch off the microphone or camera, depending on the device, Amazon will soon introduce a \u201cHome mode\u201d that prevents their devices from recording audio or video.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon will implement new Alexa commands that let you delete your stored voice data. You can say \u201cAlexa, delete everything I said today.\u201d", "description": "Stay up to date on all of Amazon\u2019s fall 2019 hardware event announcements right here.
