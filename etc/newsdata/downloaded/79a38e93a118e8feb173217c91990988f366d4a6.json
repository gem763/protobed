The Top Tier Is All White.", "language": "en", "text": "When the Democratic primary contest began last winter, it featured the most racially diverse field in history, with two black senators, a Latino former cabinet secretary, an Asian-American businessman and the first American Samoan elected to Congress . But 10 months later, the Democratic field has a top tier of four white candidates, three of them men.\n\nCandidates of color are languishing in the low single digits in polls, well behind the four leaders \u2014 former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. The divide could become even more pronounced in the coming months: Because of new, more rigorous thresholds for the Democratic debate in December, it is possible that only one nonwhite candidate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, will qualify.\n\nWith the Iowa caucuses three months away, it\u2019s a noticeable sorting of the field for an increasingly multiracial party, whose most recent White House victories were powered by a strong minority turnout for a black nominee. It has frustrated the Democrats seeking a more diverse party leadership \u2014 not to mention the affected candidates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had lots of crazy things said to me, like, \u2018Is America ready for another black president?\u2019\u201d Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said in an interview. \u201cAnd I\u2019m confident it\u2019s never been asked of a white candidate, \u2018Is America ready for another white president?\u2019\u201d", "description": "Trailing in the money race, tripped up by their own missteps and perceived by some as less electable, nonwhite candidates find themselves well back of the leaders.", "authors": ["Astead W.
