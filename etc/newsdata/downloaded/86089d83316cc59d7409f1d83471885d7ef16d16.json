The money manager has turned neutral on Australian sovereign debt, he said in an interview from Sydney.\n\nDebate over the likelihood of QE in Australia is picking up pace with economists arguing that one more rate cut will bring the central bank to the lowest policy level it can tolerate. A small sovereign debt market, which has rallied through the year as RBA slashed rates to a record low, means any systemic asset purchases may need to cover a wider pool of securities.\n\n\u201cAny sort of QE that was targeted at that end of the spectrum would be largely ineffective,\u201d Mead said, referring to sovereign bonds. \u201cThat leaves buying other assets that could be supportive whether that be residential mortgage-backed securities, or credit,\u201d even though nothing is cheap any more, he added.\n\nIn such an environment, even the very low-risk securities, such as the semi-government bonds, will be very well supported, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy even though yields look low,\u201d said Mead, who helps oversee the Pimco Australian Bond Fund which beat 91% of peers this year.\n\nThe RBA slashed its cash rate to 0.75% in October, the third reduction this year, and said it\u2019s prepared to ease again to support growth and fuel inflation. Governor Philip Lowe has, however, said that negative interest rates are extraordinary unlikely.\n\nPimco has snapped up Kangaroo bonds -- dollar debt sold by offshore institutions -- and local-currency notes issued by top-rated semi-government borrowers due in five to seven years where spreads have widened against sovereign paper, Mead said.\n\nSales of Kangaroo bonds swelled to A$10.7 billion ($7.3 billion) last quarter, the largest for a three-month period in more than a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMead\u2019s other comments on Australia:\n\nWe know that since central banks globally moved into negative rates territory, none of them have really been comfortable in the negative rates space. So for central banks that haven\u2019t been into negative territory so far, I think it\u2019s unlikely that they do anytime going forward.\n\nThe RBA has suggested that they wouldn\u2019t go negative, they\u2019ve intimated that QE or some form of alternative support will start before interest rates got to zero.\n\nThe thing to bear in mind though is when other central banks around the world first embarked on QE, assets were cheap. So for a central bank to start down the QE path now, there\u2019s nothing cheap.\n\nIf you put the whole mosaic together, as a bond investor you can have a high degree of comfort that interest rates might go up a little bit but they won\u2019t go up much.\n\nFed Cuts\n\nMead also favors U.S. Treasuries, predicting that the Federal Reserve may deliver up to three more rate cuts should the U.S.-China trade conflict drag on. Policy makers could ease less than that if there is a resolution as \u201cboth sides now have enough real data to suggest that the trade war is contributing to this window of weakness\u201d in growth, he said.\n\n\u201cWe still see U.S. duration or U.S. Treasuries as one of the preferred defensive assets still available,\u201d Mead said. Treasuries are \u201ca place you want to be overweight versus areas like Europe, the U.K., Japan,\u201d he said.", "description": "Pimco Lays Out Australian Bond Playbook as QE Speculation Grows", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picd429e935802aa6618c6dc5fcbd965667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
