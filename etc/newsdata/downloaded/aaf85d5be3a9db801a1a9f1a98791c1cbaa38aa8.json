Photo: Art Streiber\n\nJennifer Lopez is hanging upside down on a stripper pole as dozens of extras gently pelt her with money in the opening scene of Hustlers. Lopez started her career almost 30 years ago as a Fly Girl on In Living Color and remains in spectacular shape, but she still had to train for months to execute this gravity-defying feat, which, as the film\u2019s writer-director, Lorene Scafaria, puts it, \u201crequires muscles you didn\u2019t even know you had.\u201d The scene depicts a sort of reciprocal ecstasy. Lopez\u2019s expression \u2014 the epitome of self-satisfaction \u2014 was key to its authenticity. \u201cThere\u2019s no better feeling than having money fall all over your body,\u201d says Jacqueline Frances, a stripper who consulted on the film.\n\nBut behind the scenes, the dollar bills didn\u2019t rain down as freely. The film is based on Jessica Pressler\u2019s 2015 New York article \u201cThe Hustlers at Scores,\u201d about a group of strippers who drugged Wall Street guys and then ran up charges on their credit cards. Gloria Sanchez Productions \u2014 sister ship to Adam McKay and Will Ferrell\u2019s Gary Sanchez company \u2014 bought the rights, and Annapurna Pictures began developing the film. But it turns out that persuading rich white men to make a movie about other rich white men being scammed wasn\u2019t easy. \u201cI\u2019d literally stand at the front of rooms with white men and try to get them to open their wallets,\u201d says Scafaria. \u201cI felt very much like I could understand them. I think we\u2019ve all danced for the money a little bit.\u201d This is the oral history of how Hustlers got made.\n\n1. Pray Scorsese Passes\n\nIn early 2017, Annapurna Pictures asked Scafaria to be the screenwriter. Scafaria wanted to direct the film as well, but the producers had other ideas.\n\nJessica Elbaum, producer and founder, Gloria Sanchez Productions: When we first read the script, we were like, \u201cWe gotta get this to Martin Scorsese.\u201d We also thought about Adam McKay at one point. I guess it\u2019s, like, the lazy approach, which we\u2019re all guilty of at times: \u201cOh my God, send this to the people that we\u2019ve seen make this type of movie.\u201d\n\nLorene Scafaria: I was really trying to fight for the job and hoped that I could do as much directing as possible on paper in order to start to convince everyone that the director of The Meddler [an earnest mother-daughter comedy-drama starring Susan Sarandon and Rose Byrne] should be the director of Hustlers. I did a second draft, and then it became a sort of reckoning of who was going to direct it. Adam McKay knew I really wanted it. I remember him saying, \u201cI hope Scorsese passes.\u201d\n\nAt that point, I had already started editing a sizzle reel, a proof of concept, with Kayla Emter, who would eventually be the editor. I was editing at home, on my computer, footage of strippers and stripteases and setting them to Chopin.\n\nKayla Emter, editor: I love working with female directors. I think it\u2019s freeing. The communication comes a little bit easier between women \u2014 there\u2019s just a shorthand, or you can ramble and they can translate, versus having to be super specific about your work. It\u2019s more of a conversation than bullet points.\n\nElbaum: The reel was, like her writing, extraordinary \u2014 and it was sort of undeniable at that point, after those very few big swings, that it should be Lorene. It was like, \u201cOh God, no, the person that should make this movie is standing right in front of us. What are we doing?\u201d I joked with her: \u201cGod, I\u2019m so glad Martin Scorsese didn\u2019t do this movie.\u201d\n\n2. Pray J.Lo Doesn\u2019t\n\nPhoto: Art Streiber\n\nAfter Scafaria landed the job, she spent two years chasing the cast of her dreams. Lizzo, Trace Lysette, Keke Palmer, Mette Towley, Jacq the Stripper, and Cardi B all eventually signed on. But for Scafaria, one name loomed the largest: Jennifer Lopez. She knew if she didn\u2019t get Lopez, the whole thing might fall apart.\n\nScafaria: I don\u2019t really think of any actors when I\u2019m writing a script, but as soon as I was done, I realized, Oh my God, Ramona is Jennifer Lopez. Jennifer Lopez is Ramona. It has to be her.\n\nElbaum: So we got the script to Jennifer\u2019s team, and they responded and loved it.\n\nScafaria: Then we met at her home in January of 2018. She\u2019s also a producer on the film, so it was really collaborative and thought out. There were little things we did to tailor Ramona [to her], and other things we could actually do more of because it was Jennifer Lopez. I never expected to get somebody who\u2019s such a gifted dancer and performer.\n\nGayle Keller, casting director: Cardi\u2019s name was always in the mix. Lorene said, \u201cHow can you write a movie about strippers and not put Cardi B in it?\u201d She\u2019s phenomenal just for her Instagram alone. I mean, she\u2019s influencing Bernie Sanders.\n\nElbaum: Lorene had the idea to get Cardi, and Jennifer got it done.\n\nElaine Goldsmith-Thomas, producer: Jennifer called Cardi and said, \u201cYou need to be a part of this. You know this world.\u201d\n\nJennifer Lopez, Ramona: I know she knew this world better than any of us. I told her she had to do it. And I wasn\u2019t going to take no for an answer.\n\nKeller: Once we got her, I remember Lorene and I just screaming and yelling.\n\nConstance Wu, Destiny: I got the script from my agent, and I immediately knew it was something I wanted to do and I could do. But I knew that my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 at that point didn\u2019t really have anything that would indicate that I could pull off this role. I mean, I play a middle-aged mother of three boys on Fresh Off the Boat, and then I play an ing\u00e9nue in Crazy Rich Asians. So I was like, \u201cI will gladly put myself on tape for this because I love this.\u201d I would work on my TV show Monday through Friday, and then on the weekends I would work on Destiny.\n\nScafaria: I remember trying to cast the Mercedes role and saying, \u201cIt has to be Keke Palmer.\u201d This character needs to be the one who makes Ramona laugh.\n\nKeke Palmer, Mercedes: Lorene said she knew just from seeing my Insta, my personality, my work. Usually when I have a meeting with the director or writer, it\u2019s about 30, 40 minutes. Lorene and I were there for two hours. I\u2019m sure we talked about something crazy. Maybe the avocado toast we were eating?\n\nElbaum: The producers primarily were women, our filmmaker was a woman. Our editor is a woman. Our costume designer \u2014 well, he\u2019s a gay man. Our production designer\u2019s a woman; our line producer was a woman. But Lorene hired the people who were right for the job. I think this script just spoke to women.\n\nGoldsmith-Thomas: Everyone agreed to be paid less than they usually would.\n\nJulia Stiles, Elizabeth: My agent sent me the script and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a really flashy part; it\u2019s not one of the strippers.\u201d I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t care if I have to make sandwiches and sweep the floors. I\u2019ll do anything to be a part of this movie.\u201d [She plays the journalist.]\n\nKeller: Lili Reinhart\u2019s was the last part we ended up casting. It was the hardest to cast. Everyone knows her from Riverdale, but we had seen this indie movie she had done in Texas, and there was something in there \u2014 a very sweet kind of ing\u00e9nue, a damaged side to her. But [the role in Hustlers] was also a part that had some comedic qualities: She throws up when she gets nervous.\n\nLili Reinhart, Annabelle: It was animal crackers and Sprite mixed together. I would take a large gulp of it and keep it in my mouth, and when they were ready, I would just let it go. But it just tasted like animal crackers, so I didn\u2019t care.\n\n3. Sweet-Talk the Suits\n\nDirector Lorene Scafaria and cinematographer Todd Banhazl on set. Photo: Courtesy of STX\n\nShortly after Lopez became attached, Annapurna dropped the film.\n\nScafaria: The movie fell apart the day before my 40th birthday.\n\nElbaum: I think we were just part of a handful of movies that they kind of walked away from for whatever reason. We\u2019ll never really know.\n\nGoldsmith-Thomas: I was Sisyphus with the boulder of Hustlers on my back. Sometimes it would fall off and roll back on me. When it did, I\u2019d just grab the hands of Jessica and Jennifer and Lorene and put it back on my back. And I was selling primarily to men. Hustling, you might say.\n\nScafaria: It\u2019s the only time I really feel like a woman. I don\u2019t really feel that when I\u2019m on a set; I don\u2019t really feel that when I\u2019m working closely with my DP or my first AD. I feel that way when it comes to money.\n\nGoldsmith-Thomas: I\u2019d say [the male studio executives] were a little uncomfortable. Everybody could see the commercial value of this movie, but they were like, \u201cCan they just drug the bad guys? Can they just do it to the people that deserve it?\u201d They all could celebrate The Wolf of Wall Street \u2014 a guy doing it to women. By the way, does anyone deserve to be drugged? No!\n\nScafaria: Part of the struggle of getting this movie made was not the crime-drama element of it but the judgment that people have about strippers. I don\u2019t fault any stripper or sex worker for trying to make ends meet in a world that values women for their bodies. Men are also under their own construct. It\u2019s not to say I feel so horrible for the guys on Wall Street who ripped off America and the world, but I do think we\u2019re all playing a part.\n\nGoldsmith-Thomas: It was just dancing for a group of men and explaining to them, \u201cYes, the women do drug the guys, and no, they\u2019re not all bad guys, and yes, they do bad things.\u201d\n\nJacq the Stripper, comfort consultant and cast member: When I read the story a couple of years ago, I was like, Damn, this is an amazing story, and yeah, it\u2019s problematic. Surviving under capitalism is problematic for everybody, and it\u2019s important to just talk about it.\n\nElbaum: There was a small piece inside of me going, Who is going to make this?\n\nScafaria: It was an existential crisis for a while there. But I felt like I couldn\u2019t stop. I had to get another writing job, but I refused to take any other directing job. I refused to pursue any other film. I just thought, If this isn\u2019t it, I don\u2019t know what movies are. It was really dark.\n\nI knew there was a market for this movie. There aren\u2019t strip-club movies that portrayed women in a way that I was excited about. Why are we focused on these guys sitting at the table? We were pointing the camera at the wrong place.\n\nElbaum: Jennifer and her team have a strong relationship with STX, so we shared it with them and [producer] Adam Fogelson, who loved it, loved Lorene and her vision, and was super-passionate about it. I think nowadays studios are taking a lot less chances, and STX was willing to take a chance on this.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long after meeting with STX to actually get it made. I want to say less than a year. We met with them in the fall. Lorene did another pass on the script, and in December we turned it in.\n\nScafaria: I really do like to smash everything on the ground and start over. So I did a page-one rewrite of the script at some point. It was a totally different script that we got a lot of scenes out of, but it wasn\u2019t the right script. Then I did a third script with a million drafts in between. That\u2019s this movie.\n\nElbaum: We were prepping by February, we made the movie in March, we wrapped it in May, and the movie\u2019s coming out in September, which is insane. Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas always joked on set, \u201cI think we\u2019re actually making this movie?\u201d Even the day we wrapped, she was like, \u201cGuys, I think we\u2019re making this movie.\u201d\n\n4. Hit the Pole\n\nJ.Lo behind the scenes. Photo: Courtesy of STX\n\nThe problem: How to make it realistic but not exploitative?\n\nJane Musky, production designer: I\u2019ve been in the business long enough to have seen an awful lot of strip clubs in my life. But we all decided this had to be that big, broad strip club where so much was going on, the way the real Scores is.\n\nScafaria: We rented out Show Palace, a club in Long Island City, and actually cast a few of the dancers out of there. We had an open call, and a couple of the girls were just so good.\n\nMusky: When I first read the script, Show Palace was the exact strip club I had in my mind \u2014 big enough and multilevel enough to really jazz up. The owner was a great guy, and we put him in the movie; he\u2019s paying Destiny her tip in the office.\n\nWu: I installed a pole in my living room. I took pole classes; I took private coaching sessions. And this was all stuff I paid for by myself before we even started the movie. I became friends with a couple of strippers. I went to a lot of strip clubs in San Francisco \u2014 that\u2019s what I spent my Christmas Eve doing. I went with two of my guy friends, and we went to five different clubs. It was so fucking fun. And nobody knew who I was. I\u2019m not really that famous. Also nobody expects this sitcom mother of three boys to be in a strip club.\n\nScafaria: I know Jennifer and Alex [Rodriguez] went and visited a strip club, and she was able to give me some insight.\n\nJohanna Sapakie, choreographer: I asked Jennifer, \u201cHave you been to a strip club before?\u201d She said no, and I said, \u201cOkay, well, that\u2019s something you should do.\u201d\n\nLopez: I watched the ladies do their routines, met with them backstage, and talked about what it was like to have a career as a dancer. I soaked up the atmosphere and wanted to learn how to do things authentically.\n\nSapakie: Of course, she got recognized. She said some of the women were quite forward about trying to get 20 bucks. But obviously they were very generous in the club.\n\nLopez: I think it would surprise people (although it shouldn\u2019t) that most of these women are just normal women trying to get by. Just trying to pay for school, provide for their children, provide for their families. The anti-heroes and their behaviors portrayed in Hustlers are not the norm. I also asked if it was common to go home with any of the guys from the club, and they were quick to correct me. It was \u201cNo, no! I am a dancer, not an escort.\u201d There is a strict line. There are boundaries.\n\nScafaria: Jennifer is such an unbelievable dancer, but she trained so hard-core for this. I know she had a pole in her house. She\u2019s the most in-shape person you\u2019ve ever seen in your life, but pole dancing is not like anything else. So we did treat it a little bit like a sports movie.\n\nLopez: And their moves aren\u2019t easy. They really are athletes.\n\nSapakie: We worked together for about two and a half months prior to filming, and then we continued to work through filming. For someone who\u2019s never pole-danced, that\u2019s a short window. The very first thing we start with is always \u201cThis is how you climb the pole.\u201d Then you move on to spinning. And then the last hurdle was anything inverted \u2014 turning upside down and making sure she felt safe and comfortable.\n\nWu: I\u2019ve never been so sore in my life.\n\nJacq the Stripper: This is what I told the girls: When in doubt, touch yourself. Touch your leg, touch your boobs, touch your butt, play with your hair, touch your body.\n\nWu: Go slow. Slow is sexy. That was the best tip.\n\nSapakie: I also worked with Constance, Lili, and Keke. Lili enjoyed it so much that she came back for an additional session with me, just to play.\n\nReinhart: That\u2019s my party trick now.\n\n5. Make It Feel Like 2007\n\nJ.Lo and Wu lead the pack. Photo: Courtesy of STX\n\nScheduling got tricky: Cardi B was on tour, as was Lizzo; Lopez was about to be. Reinhart was filming Riverdale\u2019s third season and would have to fly back and forth from Canada multiple times in one week. Shooting began in March, with every day a \u201cwhite-knuckle race against the sun or the clock or reality,\u201d says Scafaria.\n\nElbaum: People lose their minds when they see Jennifer Lopez. You\u2019re followed by paparazzi always.\n\nGoldsmith-Thomas: We were told, \u201cIf people find out where you guys are shooting, we\u2019re going to take away your permit,\u201d because it would incite a riot. But the paparazzi always figure it out.\n\nWu: That was quite distracting.\n\nStiles: My scene with Jennifer was my first day filming, and it took every ounce of my being not to have my jaw drop. I was floored by her. She was handed a one-page monologue at the last minute, and she just read it a couple of times to herself and then delivered it as though it was not scripted. It was very surreal.\n\nScafaria: Part of the joy was seeing [Lopez\u2019s character] Ramona dress like her style icon Jennifer Lopez. We spoke about the labels that were big back then and Juicy \u2014 Jennifer made the Juicy suit famous herself! I have a feeling she\u2019s going to bring it back. We wanted things that made people go, \u201cOh my God, I was wearing those in 2007.\u201d Every earring is telling a story. I have a feeling there are going to be a lot of bandage dresses coming back. But I hope not.\n\nElbaum: Jennifer\u2019s first dance was a \u201choly shit\u201d moment. What she does on that pole is insane.\n\nScafaria: We treated it like a stunt, with three cameras. She\u2019d go through it a few times, and then we\u2019d isolate certain things and pick out other shots.\n\nSapakie: We wanted it to feel really powerful. It needed to really impress upon the viewer that this woman is the queen bee of this world. We started working on that choreography maybe about two and a half, three weeks prior to actually filming it.\n\nJason Markey, music supervisor: One of Jennifer\u2019s ideas was to dance to Fiona Apple\u2019s \u201cCriminal,\u201d but that had never been licensed for a film. And Fiona said yes. She\u2019s probably a fan of Jen\u2019s.\n\nScafaria: To me, the craziest part about this is that Jennifer Lopez stripped in a club in front of 250 people \u2014 and that\u2019s all her, you know what I mean?\n\nWu: Working with all girls, that was special because so often in movies, there\u2019s one girl. That naturally creates a scarcity complex, which creates competition. But there was zero competition.\n\nKeller: Sometimes it can be intimidating to go into a room where it\u2019s just a bunch of guys. But with women, you get excited about certain things that you wouldn\u2019t get excited about if there was a male director or producer. We get giddy; we talk a lot. If I was having a bad day, someone would go, \u201cGayle, everything\u2019s gonna be okay. Don\u2019t you worry \u2014 you\u2019re doing a great job.\u201d\n\nPalmer: We all keep in touch, but no group chat. I have too many goddamn group chats already.\n\n6. Let the Money Fall\n\nLorene Scafaria. Photo: Art Streiber\n\nScafaria was constantly in conversation with the cast members about their levels of comfort with various scenes.\n\nElbaum: Our last week we shot in the strip club.\n\nJacq the Stripper: It was like a utopian strip club from days gone by. I felt so respected for my opinion and my expertise, coming from my background where sex work is stigmatized and considered not real work, and that we\u2019re disposable and that violence against us is acceptable. It\u2019s really important to have compassionate and authentic representation of sex workers in mainstream media. And the only way that\u2019s going to be achieved is by hiring sex workers to play the parts and to consult on these films.\n\nPeople are constantly shitting on me all the time about strippers being dumb bitches. It\u2019s so toxic and it\u2019s violent. It results in literal violence against sex workers.\n\nScafaria: There\u2019s a cameo [in the club] that I\u2019m trying not to fully spoil, but that was the most fun, without question. I wrote this cameo into the script years ago, so the fact that it happened was remarkable. To watch all of the actors reacting to him was so fun. The girls were flipping out. He was a crush for everybody at some point in their lives. So that was the day we wanted to blow it out. We had the most extras we could possibly fit in the room. We had all of the women on stage together, dancing. That was our crane day. We brought out the green lasers.\n\nWu: I didn\u2019t want to do nudity. I just wasn\u2019t into it. It\u2019s not that I think there\u2019s anything wrong with it and I don\u2019t believe in it. It\u2019s just a personal thing.\n\nJacq the Stripper: In one shot, my pussy popped out of my G-string and I was like, \u201cThis G-string is too small.\u201d But Lizzo was like, \u201cOh, the carpets match the drapes!\u201d Hanging out with her and seeing her radiant, affirmative energy was really fucking cool.\n\nScafaria: I never wanted to have nudity be the reason that someone wasn\u2019t in the film. I didn\u2019t realize Lizzo was game for it until she did an interview later! The girls are all wearing exactly what they would want to be wearing, curated by the incredible Mitchell Travers. But I believe you can actually see one of our characters topless in one of the scenes.\n\nJacq the Stripper: I don\u2019t wanna, like, ruin Hollywood, but my character has new tits, and my tits are just the ones I was born with. So we were workshopping Jennifer fondling my tits. I don\u2019t know what cut we went with, but there was a lot of playing around with my boobs. I got girls grabbing my boobs all the time \u2014 I\u2019m a stripper and pretty gay. But I was like, \u201cThis is cool. She\u2019s got soft hands, very consenting.\u201d\n\nScafaria: If we\u2019re focused on someone\u2019s body in these scenes, it\u2019s because they want us to be. It\u2019s a bit of a Trojan horse, that way, the movie. It toys with the male gaze, the same way strippers might toy with it.\n\nEmter: Exactly when you want more is when we cut out. Just to keep you leaning forward and to control the gaze.\n\nElbaum: I\u2019ve been at this for a while, but this movie validated what it is that I\u2019ve been trying to do and what I\u2019m going to keep doing.\n\nScafaria: Movies about women \u2014 I think people want them to be perfect, just like they do in life. I heard it was hard to get Ocean\u2019s Eight made. That makes me crazy.\n\n*This article appears in the September 2, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
