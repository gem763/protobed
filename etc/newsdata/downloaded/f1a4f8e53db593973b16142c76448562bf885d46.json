Guardiola admitted they will have their work cut out trying to haul back Liverpool.\n\n\u201cIt is a lot of points,\u201d the City manager said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t drop points for many circumstances. Today was the day we created less than the other games, even [in the 3-2 defeat against] Norwich we created a lot.\n\n\u201cWe have faced many teams who defend deep and more or less we found a way to win but today we had a problem. It is better not to think that one team is eight points ahead.\n\n\u201cI know these guys. Still they are incredibly involved and can do it. What happened, happened. Most of the teams who won in the past, the year after, don\u2019t win. Today we were not in our level. The previous games were good but the distance is big. I know that.\n\n\u201cLiverpool are not dropping points but we are in October and there are still a lot of games and competitions to play.\n\n\u201cIt was a bad day, sometimes it happens. We started quite well and, after we conceded two situations in our build up where it\u2019s impossible to defend, we got a little bit nervous.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAsked why his players were nervous, Guardiola said: \u201cIt sometimes happens. We spoke about this, \u2018Come on guys, a lot of games to play, we did it and we\u2019re going to do it again\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe lost to a good team that were really well-organised, had good physicality, strong in the air and so fast on the counter-attack.\u201d\n\nPep Guardiola admitted his players were nervous in defeat Credit: AP\n\nNicolas Otamendi was particularly poor alongside Fernandinho in a makeshift central defence but Guardiola refused to point the finger.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said when asked if it was a game too far for that pairing. \u201cThey were quite good. They suffered because we lost the position in front of them. No central defenders can sustain the kind of balls we lose in the first moments.\u201d\n\nNuno Espirito Santo, the Wolves manager, paid tribute to his players\u2019 commitment and application and was delighted to see Adama Traore score twice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very, very proud, it was a very good performance,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than the performance, it was the way they ran. City move the ball so fast and it required a lot of running from our boys.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same City as last season and you have to find solutions, the areas to exploit. The first thing is to stop them playing, how they create chances. My players ran like crazy.\n\n\u201cHaving a fantastic group of players who want to grow makes me proud. They believe and want to work. The challenge is to sustain this.\n\n\u201cAdama played well. He went to the limits for us. It wasn\u2019t only him, all of them did well.\u201d", "description": "Pep Guardiola claimed nerves got the better of Manchester City and admitted the champions have given themselves a mountain to climb in the title race after their worst start to a season for six years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JMicMjJSBkoRMlBPGLrfgA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FC3Qa19aQS2KrW5c.w2FuA--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/38c039d7065af17efbf7bae1bf627772", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
