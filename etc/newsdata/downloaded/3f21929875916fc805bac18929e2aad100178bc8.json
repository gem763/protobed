Of those, almost 3 in 5 employers found content that turned them off from a candidate altogether.\n\nErasing your online footprint entirely isn\u2019t an ideal solution either for job-hunters. Almost half of employers are less likely to schedule an interview with a candidate who doesn\u2019t have any presence online.\n\n\n\nYour \u201conline presence is now your resume,\u201d Patrick Ambron, CEO of BrandYourself, an online reputation management company with about one million clients, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cOnline screening is skyrocketing.\u201d\n\nJob seekers are coached on interview practices with Amazon during a career fair held at Vertiport Chicago on September 17, 2019 in Chicago, Illinois.

It can also help enhance your online visibility as a job candidate. The service typically includes social media clean-up, prioritizing positive Google search results, and protecting private information.\n\nAmbron started his New York-based company after Pete Kistler, his co-founder, had trouble getting an internship because he shared the same name with a drug dealer. Unfortunately, the dealer rather Kistler himself showed up at the top of the search results for his name.\n\nKistler learned how to make results pertaining to him more search engine friendly so that they rise up and surpass the negative results. After months of effort, he buried the drug-dealer\u2019s results off the first page.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s just one reason candidates decide to invest in their online presence, Ambron said. Some job hunters have been victims of online rumors, criticism, and even revenge porn. Others simply use the service to improve their online presence and search results, potentially helping them get a job.\n\nWhat does an online makeover include?\n\nBrandYourself, which serves clients of differing ages and job experience, offers several tiers of services. Its basic do-it-yourself online service, which includes a social media scan or improving search results, runs between $20 and $100. The company also offers a more personalized approach for more complicated issues like being a victim of revenge porn that starts at $3,000 per year.\n\nUsers can submit content they want employers to see, like specific social media posts or a portfolio website and the company helps you make these results more search-friendly. The company also identifies content that employers could find problematic that you should remove from your social media.\n\nPotential employers search your online social media profiles for these four red flags.

It includes services like image analysis, reputation strategy and positive content development.\n\n\u201cWe know what Google likes,\u201d said Kent Campbell, managing director of Reputation X. \u201cAnd what we\u2019ll do is post content that is really positive, and then we\u2019ll promote it in search results, so it rises.\u201d\n\n\n\nCampbell calls this \u201cgenetically-modified content\u201d and it\u2019s used to suppress negative results. Some content is hard to be moved from the top page \u2013 such as an article from a major news outlet \u2013 this costs even more, up to $10,000 to $20,000 a month.", "description": "Reputation management sounds like a service that only a high-profile politician or a movie star actor would pay for.
