REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\n\nThe remarks come as Thyssenkrupp\u2019s efforts to list or sell the unit, which some analysts believe could be valued at 17 billion euros ($18.8 billion) or more, with at least 10 bidders shortlisted to submit indicative offers.\n\nLabour representatives have always had great influence at the steel-to-submarines conglomerate and hold half of the 20 seats on its supervisory board, with IG Metall members representing the majority of those.\n\n\u201cWe will not give our approval without a fair agreement, without clear commitments to employees - no matter who the bidder is,\u201d IG Metall head Joerg Hofmann told Reuters, indicating large job cuts would be met with fierce opposition.\n\nHofmann said it was good that there was a competitive bidding process to seek the highest offer for Elevator Technology (ET), by far Thyssenkrupp\u2019s most profitable unit, which employs 53,000, a third of the group\u2019s total staff.\n\n\u201cBut I am also making it very clear: there also needs to be a competitive bidding process for fairness with regard to employees,\u201d he said. ET employs about 5,000 staff in Germany.\n\nThe sale or listing of ET forms the core of a plan that new CEO Martina Merz must quickly implement to turn around the stricken conglomerate\u2019s fortunes following four profit warnings and two botched restructurings.\n\nIG Metall\u2019s Hofmann also lashed out at Finland\u2019s Kone (KNEBV.HE), whose CEO has expressed interest in a deal, but said earlier this week he might divest Thyssenkrupp assets to address possible antitrust concerns.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it at all when Kone, being one of numerous interested parties, already openly speculates about divesting parts of TK Elevator. That\u2019s certainly not a good offer to employees,\u201d Hofmann said.\n\nMarkus Grolms, vice chairman of Thyssenkrupp\u2019s supervisory board and trade secretary at IG Metall, also said that workers would not accept that ET be torn apart. \u201cThis also applies to Kone,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn our basic agreement with management we have clearly established that any bidder must strike an agreement with us before a signing takes place. That\u2019s not negotiable,\u201d Grolms said, adding any buyer must present a future plan for the unit.\n\nOther possible bidders include Hitachi (6501.T), Brookfield (BAMa.TO), CVC [CVC.UL], Hellman & Friedman, a tie-up of Blackstone (BX.N) and Carlyle (CG.O) as well as a consortium consisting of Advent, Cinven [CINV.UL] and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.", "description": "Top representatives at IG Metall, Germany's biggest union, will not approve a sale of Thyssenkrupp's prized elevator division unless potential buyers give far-reaching concessions to employees, they said.", "authors": ["Tom K\u00e4ckenhoff", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445461043&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q09X", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
