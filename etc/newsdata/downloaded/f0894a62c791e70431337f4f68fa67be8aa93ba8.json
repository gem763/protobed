They went on to find the places in the universe where these are found \u2013 with the exception of one.\n\n\"This is the final stage of a decades-long chase to pin down the origin of the elements,\" said the study's lead author Darach Watson from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.\n\n\"We know now that the processes that created the elements happened mostly in ordinary stars, in supernova explosions, or in the outer layers of old stars. But, until now, we did not know the location of the final, undiscovered process, known as rapid neutron capture, that created the heavier elements in the periodic table.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It is probably best known for providing the salts that allow fireworks to include red colours.\n\nThe story of watching the process began in 2017, when scientists spotted the first ever gravitational wave. When they did, telescopes around the world turned towards its source: named GW170817, it was a neutron star merger deep in space.\n\nIf heavier elements were created when neutron stars collided, scientists thought they would be able to see evidence of them in kilonovae, which are left behind from those mergers.\n\nIt was looking in data taken at that time that researchers spotted the elements that were left behind.\n\n\"By reanalysing the 2017 data from the merger, we have now identified the signature of one heavy element in this fireball, strontium, proving that the collision of neutron stars creates this element in the Universe,\" said Watson.", "description": "Scientists have found the answer to a decades-long mystery, in the middle of two colliding stars.
