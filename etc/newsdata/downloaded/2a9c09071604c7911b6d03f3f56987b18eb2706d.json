Barack Obama was following in the EU\u2019s footsteps when he went ahead with Obamacare despite Scott Brown\u2019s victory in Massachusetts in January 2010, and when he expanded his DACA program to the parents of illegal immigrants brought here as children despite Republican gains in the 2014 election and despite his own admission that he lacked authority.\n\nJames Comey\u2019s towering ego and self-regard compelled him to interfere in the 2016 election with consequences we can only begin to reckon. Over the last two-and-a-half years, district judges and anonymous bureaucrats have impeded and obstructed the agenda of a duly elected chief executive. A few weeks ago a former governor of the Federal Reserve suggested in Bloomberg that the central bank should thwart Trump\u2019s reelection. And in England, elite resistance to the results of the 2016 Brexit referendum and to the 2017 parliamentary invocation of Article 50 has brought the government into a crisis from which there seems no escape.\n\nIn such an environment, one begins to see the appeal of nongovernmental instruments of power. What might be rejected at the ballot box can be achieved through \u201cnudging\u201d in the market and in the third sector. If you can\u2019t enact national gun control through Congress, why not leverage the economic and cultural weight of America\u2019s largest corporations? The market, we are told, is not a democracy.", "description": "", "authors": ["Matthew Continetti", "Freebeacon.Com Columns The-Wages-Of-Woke"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
