The hurricane center said the Category 3 storm was likely to become a post-tropical cyclone by Friday.\n\nWhile the storm did not hit Bermuda directly, it pounded the British Atlantic island offshore with heavy rain while powerful winds above 100 mph knocked down power lines and trees.\n\nThe storm left more than 80% of the territory without electricity on Thursday.\n\nRead this: Are Category 5 hurricanes such as Dorian the 'new normal'?\n\nAuthorities said Humberto also blew off rooftops as it passed by the island. No deaths were reported.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made it through and everyone is safe,\u201d said Premier David Burt. \u201cThat\u2019s what is most important.\u201d\n\nSecurity Minister Wayne Caines said schools and government offices were closed. He asked people to stay off roads while emergency crews cleared debris and removed power lines.\n\nImedla in Texas\n\nIn Texas, the remnants of Imelda triggered flash flooding, with areas east of Houston hit the hardest.\n\nAuthorities said all service roads were impassable and two hospitals were inaccessible in Beaumont, a city of just under 120,000 people about 30 miles from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe Beaumont Police Department said on Twitter it had gotten emergency calls for more than 250 high water rescues and 270 evacuations.\n\nIn the town of Winnie, about 60 miles east of Houston, a hospital was evacuated and several homes and business were flooded.\n\nThe Chambers County Sheriff\u2019s Office said the town is \u201cbeing devastated by rising water.\u201d\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Hurricane Jerry aims for Puerto Rico; Bermuda power outage", "description": "Tropical\u00a0Storm Jerry strengthens into a hurricane.
