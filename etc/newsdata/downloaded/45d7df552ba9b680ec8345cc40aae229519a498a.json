They just wiped it out.\"\n\nNetanyahu's comments followed a Reuters report revealing that the International Atomic Energy Agency found traces of uranium at a different site in Iran that the Israeli leader had first pointed to during a speech last year at the United Nations.\n\nIran had yet to explain the traces of uranium at that site, though it denies ever having sought a nuclear weapon.\n\nNetanyahu, who strongly opposed a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, made the remarks in a televised speech about a week before a general election in Israel in which he is in a tight race to win another term.\n\n\"I call on the international community to wake up, to realize that Iran is systematically lying,\" Netanyahu said.\n\n\"The only way to stop Iran's march to the bomb, and its aggression in the region, is pressure, pressure and more pressure.\"\n\nIran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif later tweeted in response that Netanyahu's accusation was mere war mongering, and that Israel \"cries wolf\" about the site.\n\n\u2014CNBC's Ganesh Setty contributed to this report.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Tehran had been developing nuclear weapons at a secret site in Abadeh in Iran.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104324018-RTS11I52.jpg?v=1529452235", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
