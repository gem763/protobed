There\u2019s the idea that you want to keep your brain active in later life,\u201d said Michael McConnell, a neuroscientist at the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThe thing that is super unexpected is \u2026 limiting neural activity is a good thing in healthy aging. It\u2019s very counterintuitive.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nResearchers at Harvard Medical School analyzed brain tissue donated to human brain banks by people ranging in age from their 60s and 70s to centenarians who lived to be 100 or older. They found that people who died before their mid-80s had lower levels in their brains of a protein called REST that tamps down genes involved in sparking brain activity, compared to the very oldest people. REST had already been shown to be protective against Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But they weren\u2019t sure whether REST somehow protected people from death or was just a sign of further aging.\n\nSince it is not currently possible to measure REST in the brains of living people, the scientists began a series of experiments in roundworms and mice to test whether it plays a role in life span. When researchers increased the activity of a worm version of REST, the worms\u2019 brain activity decreased and they lived longer. The opposite happened when scientists disabled the REST-like gene in \u201cMethuselah\u201d roundworms that have very long life spans; the worms\u2019 neural activity increased \u2014 and their lives were dramatically shortened. Mice lacking REST were also more likely to have busier brains, including seizure-like bursts of activity.\n\n\u201cI think this is overactivity, out-of-control excitation \u2014 it\u2019s not good for the brain. You want the neurons to be active, when and where you want them to be active, not to be just generally firing off,\u201d said Cynthia Kenyon, vice president of aging research at Calico Labs, who praised the study design but said she thinks the nervous system is just one of the many tissues that have an influence on life span.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear how these differences in brain activity at the level of cells could translate to differences in cognition or behavior in people. Bruce Yankner, a professor of genetics and neurology at Harvard Medical School who led the work, said that his lab is already following up to see if targeting REST with drugs could lead to new ways to treat neurodegenerative diseases or aging itself. This line of research could also be of interest in trying to understand how alternative interventions such as meditation, which affects neural rhythms, might work as a treatment for early memory loss, Yankner said.\n\n\u201cI think the implication of our study is that with aging, there is some aberrant or deleterious neural activity that not only makes the brain less efficient, but is harmful to the physiology of the person or the animal, and reduces life span as a result,\u201d Yankner said.\n\nThe donated brains that researchers studied came from people who died of various causes, making it impossible to know whether the difference in REST was related to the likelihood of death.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAngela Gutchess, a professor of psychology at Brandeis University, said that when people age and are tested in brain scanners, there are many changes in activity in the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain where the Harvard researchers studied REST.\n\nIn some cases, she said, studies have shown that older adults activate more brain circuits compared to younger people to complete a task. But the implication of this change is unclear: These patterns of activation may be an indication of a less efficient brain in older people, or of attempts to compensate.\n\nOne model, called \u201cCRUNCH,\u201d tries to explain changes in patterns of brain activation with age. It says that when people attempt harder and harder tasks, more regions of their brain are activated, until they reach a crunch point where they run out of mental resources. Older people have an earlier crunch point and can\u2019t activate as many regions. Another, called \u201cSTAC,\u201d says that older adults have natural variation in their basic scaffolding of natural cognitive resources, and those variations influence how and whether people can engage more neural regions when faced with difficult tasks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGutchess said the new study was intriguing and a reminder that to really understand the aging brain will require connecting the dots between observations and models from scientific labs that focus on very different scales, ranging from human behavior, to brain imaging, to the functioning of individual cells.\n\n\u201cWe need to bridge across different levels of expertise,\u201d Gutchess said.\n\nRead More:\n\nAD", "description": "More isn't necessarily better, at least for the excitation of brain cells.", "authors": ["Carolyn Y.
