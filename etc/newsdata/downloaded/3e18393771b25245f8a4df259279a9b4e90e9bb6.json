It puts us in a good position,\u201d Solskjaer, who had criticised the state of the artificial pitch in the build-up, said.\n\nWhile United defended well, the paucity of their attacking options was again in evidence as their run without an away win in all competitions stretched to 10.\n\nSolskjaer\u2019s side have now failed to score more than one goal in a game since they began the season with a 4-0 thumping of Chelsea in the Premier League.\n\nIf any team looked like scoring it was Alkmaar for whom the lively Oussama Idrissi was the best attacking player on view.\n\nAlkmaar striker Myron Boadu had a first-half goal ruled out for offside before Idrissi forced David de Gea into a sharp save. Idrissi skimmed an effort wide after the break and tested De Gea again with a powerful shot the keeper punched away.\n\nUnited\u2019s ambition was limited but they brought on Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard and Scott McTominay in the final quarter of the game to try and force a winner.\n\nRashford was denied what looked a blatant penalty 10 minutes from time when he appeared to be clipped by a sliding Stijn Wuytens after a sharp turn in the area.\n\nLingard, left out of the England squad earlier on Thursday, had United\u2019s best effort with a dipping shot just wide soon after but worryingly for Solskjaer he limped off before the end.\n\nOne of the positives for United was an assured performance by Brandon Williams who made his first start at left back.", "description": "Manchester United's lean goalscoring form continued in a turgid 0-0 draw away to Dutch club AZ Alkmaar in their second Group L match in the Europa League on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436791184&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921S2"}
