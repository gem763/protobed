She warned of the hazards of wall-building and the threat of nationalism \u2014 and also offered the U.S. president some financial advice.\n\nLagarde, who will soon leave the IMF to take the helm at the European Central Bank, said the U.S. \u2015 which she described as having long been \u201ca force for good\u201d in the world, advocating for the rule of law, democracy and the free market \u2015 is currently \u201cat risk of losing leadership\u201d on the global stage.\n\nIf that happens, it \u201cwould be just a terrible development,\u201d Lagarde said.\n\nThe IMF chief suggested that Trump\u2019s unpredictability, as well as the ongoing U.S.-China trade conflict, has had a negative impact on global economic growth.\n\nUncertainty is \u201cnot propitious to economic development,\u201d she said, adding that Trump \u201chas many keys that would unlock the uncertainty and the risks.\u201d\n\nThe brewing trade war between the U.S. and China is \u201ccertainly going to give a big haircut to the global economy,\u201d said Lagarde, who was the first woman to head the IMF and will be the first woman to serve as president of the ECB.\n\nShe urged all policymakers involved in the conflict to \u201cplease sit down like big men ... and put everything on the table and try to deal bit by bit, piece by piece, so that we have certainty.\u201d\n\nChristine Lagarde, outgoing head of the International Monetary Fund and incoming president of the European Central Bank, on President Trump\u2019s effect on the global economy https://t.co/b6BjVxVMJ9 pic.twitter.com/BO34A6GaBx \u2014 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) October 20, 2019\n\nWhen asked about Trump\u2019s self-professed nationalism, Lagarde cautioned against embracing such an ideology in an interconnected world.\n\n\u201cInternational trade, connections, movement of people and movement of capital has taken hundreds of millions out of poverty. Now, some people in the advanced economies might say, \u2018Pooh. What do I care?\u2019 Well, of course we care for the person next door. And because of the interconnections, next door is not down the pathway, next door is everywhere around the world,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd if my neighbors from across a border are feeling desperate, are starving, are fighting, there will be consequences back at home,\u201d Lagarde added.\n\nShe went on to warn of the limitations of building walls.\n\n\u201cWhat can walls do about pandemics? What can walls do about terrorism? What can walls do about climate change and destruction of the environment? This is not the answer to the global questions and issues that interconnect, whether we like it or not,\u201d she said.\n\nChristine Lagarde discusses the United States\u2019 risk of losing leadership in the global economy https://t.co/XJQUb76JCu pic.twitter.com/KXLDURctJL \u2014 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) October 20, 2019\n\n\u201cMarket stability should not be the subject of a tweet here or a tweet there. It requires consideration, thinking, quiet and measured and rational decisions,\u201d Lagarde said, pointing out the inflation risks linked to Trump\u2019s interest rate demands.\n\n\u201cWhen the unemployment rate is at 3.7%, you don\u2019t want to accelerate that too much by lowering interest rates,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause the risk you take is that then prices begin to go up. You have to be very careful. You know, it\u2019s like navigating a plane.\u201d", "description": "Christine Lagarde, IMF\u2019s outgoing chairwoman, offered financial advice to President Trump \u2014 and warned of the risks of nationalism and wall-building.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dad7c7e210000e81dad364b.jpeg?cache=xgfmxllxjd&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
