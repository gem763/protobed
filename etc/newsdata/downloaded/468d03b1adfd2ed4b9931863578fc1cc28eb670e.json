REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nAs Johnson prepares to lead the United Kingdom out of the European Union on Oct. 31, his past relations with several women have come under scrutiny. The allegations overshadowed the Conservative Party\u2019s annual conference which opened on Sunday.\n\nCharlotte Edwardes, a columnist, wrote in The Sunday Times that Johnson had groped her at a lunch in 1999 when he was editor of The Spectator magazine.\n\n\u201cUnder the table, I feel Johnson\u2019s hand on my thigh. He gives it a squeeze,\u201d Edwardes wrote. \u201cHis hand is high up my leg and he has enough inner flesh beneath his fingers to make me sit suddenly upright.\u201d\n\nEdwardes said that after the meal, she confided in another woman who had sat on the other side of Johnson. The other woman said Johnson had also groped her, Edwardes said.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s spokesman told reporters: \u201cThis allegation is untrue.\u201d\n\nAfter the denial by Downing Street, Edwardes said on Twitter: \u201cIf the prime minister doesn\u2019t recollect the incident then clearly I have a better memory than he does.\u201d\n\nFinance minister Sajid Javid repeatedly refused to address the allegations when questioned on Monday but said the prime minister had said they were untrue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to the prime minister about that and first of all he couldn\u2019t be clearer - absolutely clear - that they (the claims) are completely untrue,\u201d Javid told the BBC.\n\nLondon\u2019s Labour-run local government said on Friday it had referred Johnson to Britain\u2019s police watchdog for potential investigation over allegations of misconduct involving a U.S. businesswoman while he was mayor of London.\n\nThe referral follows allegations, first reported by The Sunday Times, that when Johnson was mayor, he failed to declare close personal links to tech entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri who received thousands of pounds in public business funding and places on official trade trips.\n\nAsked about the referral, Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThe prime minister as mayor of London did a huge amount of work when selling our capital city around the world, beating the drum for London and the UK.\u201d", "description": "A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has denied allegations that Johnson groped two women 20 years ago.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435433088&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T0BP", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
