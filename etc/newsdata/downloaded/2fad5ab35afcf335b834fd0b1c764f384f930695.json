The relationship between the UK and the EU as a whole is unsympathetic, with many [member states] (under pressure from the Commission) unwilling to engage bilaterally and implementing protections unilaterally.\"\n\nIn a letter to former Attorney General Dominic Grieve and Labour MP Hilary Benn, who spearheaded the cross-party effort to get the document published, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, who is in charge of no-deal planning, said he had provided the \u201cmost recent complete iteration\u201d of the government\u2019s no-deal planning assumptions, which are codenamed Yellowhammer.\n\nMuch of the content of the Operation Yellowhammer report had already been leaked to the Sunday Times. Gove said at the time it was an \u201cold\u201d document.\n\nThe document also warns that there could be up to three months of Channel crossing disruption. It warns medicine supply chains could be \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d to extended delays, and a chemical \"supply chain failure\" could mean urgent action is needed to make sure people have clean water.", "description": "UK government releases summary of its Operation Yellowhammer planning assumptions.", "authors": ["Annabelle Dickson", "Hans Von Der Burchard", "Paul Dallison"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GettyImages-914880156-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
