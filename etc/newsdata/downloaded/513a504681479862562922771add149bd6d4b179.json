I\u2019m in the clear now, simply because I caught it early \u2026 I\u2019ve worked for two years and I\u2019ve just been happy, and the good Lord looked after me.\u201d\n\nHe recommended men have their prostates checked: \u201cGuys, you\u2019ve got to really go to the doctor \u2026 Finger up the bum, no harm done.\u201d At the event, he also reunited for a performance with former Faces bandmates Ronnie Wood and Kenney Jones.\n\nIt is the second time Stewart, 74, has had treatment for cancer \u2013 in 2000, he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. \u201cI felt fearful, vulnerable to a degree that I never had before,\u201d he later wrote in an autobiography, but the tumour was quickly removed. \u201cNo chemotherapy was required \u2013 which, in turn, meant there was no risk that I\u2019d lose my hair,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd let\u2019s face it: if we\u2019re ranking threats to the survival of my career, losing my hair would be second only to losing my voice.\u201d\n\nStewart is beginning a short Las Vegas concert residency this week, ahead of an arena tour of the UK beginning in Manchester on 23 November. His most recent album, Blood Red Roses, was released in September 2018 and reached No 1 in the UK.", "description": "Stewart says, \u2018I\u2019ve just been happy, and the good Lord looked after me\u2019, following prostate cancer diagnosis two years ago", "authors": ["Ben Beaumont-Thomas"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c87dce25479bbf412fbb5106662c208f3a14c7b6/0_28_3372_2023/master/3372.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=84f62dab55c4c3ae809b934b2b986ad7", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
