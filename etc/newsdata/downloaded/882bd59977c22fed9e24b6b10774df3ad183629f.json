Bernie Sanders to be endorsed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an influential voice among young liberals", "language": "en", "text": "The surprise endorsements are a political coup for Sanders, 78, who has been fading in the polls and faced growing questions about his age and health. Before Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate, he had been sidelined from the campaign trail for two weeks by a heart attack.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to Saturday,\u201d said Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez. Sanders teased the rally at Tuesday night\u2019s presidential debate, saying he would have a \u201cspecial guest\u201d appearing with him in New York.\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement, Omar said she had worked closely with Sanders on several policy initiatives, including a measure to cancel student debt and another to provide year-round school meals.\n\n\u201cBernie is leading a working class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity, and geography,\u201d Omar said.\n\nSanders campaign officials declined to comment.\n\nThe endorsements could be a blow for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who, like Sanders, is running on a platform of sweeping liberal change and who has emphasized her role as a female pioneer. Ocasio-Cortez had worked as a volunteer organizer for Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential bid; she was recruited to run for Congress in 2018 by Justice Democrats, a group that grew out of the Sanders campaign.\n\nAD\n\nFew figures hold as much sway in the party\u2019s liberal wing as Ocasio-Cortez, whose 2018 primary win over then-Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) sent political shock waves across the country and made her an overnight star. Sanders recently was spotted meeting with Ocasio-Cortez in Vermont.\n\nAD\n\nHer backing was a sought-after prize in the Democratic primary, and it was widely assumed that she would endorse either Sanders or Warren, the most liberal figures in the contest.\n\nOcasio-Cortez plans to appear with Sanders at a Bernie\u2019s Back rally Saturday in Queens, just outside the boundaries of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s congressional district.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what the other two members of the Squad \u2014 Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) \u2014 planned to do. Media representatives for the lawmakers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump has attacked the members of the Squad, at one point suggesting they should \u201cgo back\u201d to their own countries \u2014 even though they are American citizens \u2014 and has sought to make them the face of the Democratic Party. He recently held a rally in Omar\u2019s district.\n\nSanders and Warren have been battling for the support of the women, holding individual meetings with them, co-sponsoring their legislation and wishing them well on social media. On Tuesday, Sanders unveiled legislation with Omar to enact a universal school meals program.\n\nAll four members of the group were elected to the House in 2018.\n\nAD", "description": "The senator from Vermont wins the backing of the congresswoman from New York, a major coup and a potential blow to Sen.
