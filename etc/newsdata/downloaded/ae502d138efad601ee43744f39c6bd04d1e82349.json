REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui\n\nThe densely-populated, working class area in the main city, Srinagar, is a pocket of resistance to India\u2019s removal in early August of special status for Jammu and Kashmir, the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state.\n\nWhile some normalcy has returned to the region more than seven weeks after the crackdown began, there is little sign of an end to the standoff in Anchar, home to about 15,000 people.\n\nEntrances to the area are guarded by young people manning barricades made of tree trunks, electricity poles and barbed wire to keep the police out.\n\nLaneways have been dug up to block security vehicles.\n\nAs night falls, groups of youths, many wearing masks and armed with stones and tree branches, are huddled around bonfires, sipping tea provided by neighbors.\n\n\u201cI am spending the night outdoors so I can protect my family and not let Indians, who have been committing atrocities on us, to enter,\u201d said Fazil, a 16-year-old student.\n\n\u201cThere is no fear in me,\u201d he added, holding a thick tree branch as he watched the street from a checkpoint.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has said Kashmir\u2019s special status, which allowed only residents to buy property and hold government jobs, restricted its development and encouraged a separatist revolt that has killed 40,000 people since 1989.\n\nIndian authorities have arrested nearly 4,000 people since the decision provoked outrage in the region and inflamed tensions with Pakistan, which also claims the territory.\n\nIndia cut internet and mobile services and imposed curfew-like restrictions to prevent protests. More than seven weeks later, some normalcy has returned and many of those detained have since been freed.\n\nTelephone landlines are working again, though mobile and internet networks remain suspended.\n\nShops open briefly to allow people to restock supplies and traffic is back on Srinagar\u2019s streets. On some evenings, people stroll along the boulevard by Dal lake, framed by the Himalayas.\n\n\u2018ONLY SEE BULLETS\u2019\n\nHowever, Anchar remains a no-go zone for security forces, and government services like schools are still shut in the area, prompting residents to come up with workarounds.\n\nFour college students have set up a makeshift school in a three-room house to give lessons to 200 children for a few hours each day. They keep streaming in, the girls with their heads covered, books in hand from nursery rhymes to mathematics.\n\n\u201cThe education of students in this locality is suffering because of the turmoil. We won\u2019t let our future generations suffer,\u201d said Adil, a college student turned teacher.\n\nAnother student teacher, Walid, said: \u201cThese children only see bullets and pellets every day\u201d.\n\nOther students are providing basic medical care so people need not go into other areas of the city for fear of arrest.\n\nSlideshow (33 Images)\n\nRubina said her 15-year-old son was injured by pellets fired by security forces while he was returning home from Friday prayers.\n\nThe boy\u2019s head is heavily bandaged and he hasn\u2019t spoken since the incident, but the family would rather treat him at home than take him to a city hospital, fearing he would be detained by police.\n\n\u201cIf he has to go out for a change of bandage to the nearby government hospital, he will be accompanied by six or seven women, so they don\u2019t snatch him away,\u201d Rubina said.", "description": "Few people step outside Anchar, a neighborhood ringed by steel barricades and razor wire in Indian Kashmir, where police have imposed a weeks-long regionwide clampdown to stifle protests.", "authors": ["Danish Siddiqui", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434333964&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P28Y", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
