Former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn was also charged in the indictment.\n\nShares fell as much as 3% in European hours on news of the indictment.\n\n\"The company has meticulously investigated this matter with the help of internal and external legal experts for almost four years.

VW has already paid roughly $33 billion in costs related to the incident, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe indictment may also harm VW's odds at winning an investor mass lawsuit, with shareholders asking for more than 9 billion euros in damages related to the scandal. The automaker has already accounted for 5.5 billion euros worth of emissions-scandal costs, with 3.4 billion euros reserved for investor lawsuits, chief financial officer Frank Witter said in May.\n\nThe new indictment must now be reviewed by a regional court before it's decided whether the men will be tried. The review is set to take months, making a possible trial likely to start no sooner than 2020, according to Bloomberg.\n\nWinterkorn left the automaker just days after scandal went public. He was charged with aggravated fraud by a German court in April and could face up to ten years in prison if convicted. Winterkorn has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nFitbit's 2-day surge hits 19% on reports the company is seeking a sale \u2014 and its bankers are eyeing a Google takeover\n\nBeyond Meat gets nailed with its lowest price target yet from firm worried about competition, stock valuation\n\nDisney CEO Bob Iger is officially leaving Apple's board.
