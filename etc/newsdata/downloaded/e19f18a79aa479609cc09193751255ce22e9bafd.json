We look forward to presenting our case in court.\u201d\n\nThe news comes after Seth Shapiro, head of strategy at VideoCoin, a decentralized video encoding, storage, and content distribution system, said the phone company had failed to secure his device when it was hacked in May last year.\n\nAccording to Shapiro, hackers allegedly gained control of his mobile phone, reset his email, and then breached several accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges, stealing $1 million in the process.\n\n\u201cRecent high profile cases reinforce the importance of businesses and consumers taking steps to protect against SIM swap fraud, such as not using mobile phone numbers as the single source of security and authentication,\u201d Greer added.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the phone giant made headlines in recent weeks. Back in August, it was revealed that AT&T employees unlocked millions of mobile phones to plant malware and removed the phones from the provider\u2019s network \u2014 in exchange for thousands of dollars in bribes.\n\nThe details were revealed after the US Department of Justice (DoJ) opened a case against Muhammad Fahd, who had been accused of operating a fraudulent operation to disable AT&T\u2018s proprietary software that safeguards phones from being unlocked.\n\nPrior to that, in July, a US federal judge disregarded AT&T\u2018s request to dismiss a a $224 million lawsuit over yet another SIM-swapping incident that led to $24 million in stolen cryptocurrency.\n\nA press release published at the time said the telecom giant would face court over allegations that it violated the Federal Communications Act, as well as several other laws, when hackers used the identity (and telephone account) of cryptocurrency investor Michael Terpin in 2017.\n\nAT&T began accepting cryptocurrency as an online payment option at the end of May, claiming to be the first major US mobile carrier to do so.", "description": "AT&T will dispute allegations that it was negligent after allegedly contributing to the loss of $1.7 million worth of digital assets owned by a customer in the latest SIM swap case.", "authors": ["Yessi Bello Perez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FATT.jpg&signature=a9b0a988d9636cb8331ad18ab8fc1bf7", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
