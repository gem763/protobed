Such is the case of Kylie Jenner and her attempted trademark of \u201cRise and Shine\u201d, which has been reportedly been challenged by a woman who already trademarked \u201cRise-N-Shine\u201d.\n\nIn case you\u2019re not already caught up on this endlessly silly story, here\u2019s the gist: makeup mogul Jenner was captured singing the words \u201crise and shine\u201d to her baby bub, Stormi, and footage of her non-sequitur vocal performance went viral. She then cranked out some merch featuring the phrase to capitalise on her extra notoriety. Her trademark application followed, presumably to prevent anyone else from printing hoodies with the phrase.\n\nEnter Cathy Beggan, founder and president of vitamin company Rise-N-Shine, LLC, who reportedly told The Blast that Jenner\u2019s trademark application might actually overlap with her own.\n\n\u201cOur company already produces cosmetic products as well as clothing items bearing the Rise-N-Shine phrase, meaning that her trademark filing infringes on our rights,\u201d Beggan said.\n\nAs we reported last week, Jenner\u2019s trademark application covers basically every type of apparel you can imagine. Elsewhere, a quick perusal of the Rise-N-Shine website reveals the vitamin company pumps out its own merch, complete with its titular catchphrase.\n\nBeggan said she\u2019s never felt the need to protect her trademark before, but Jenner\u2019s big move might push her to defend \u201cmy company\u2019s rights in this case.\u201d\n\nBefore it gets to that, a compromise might be on offer.\n\n\u201cIf Kylie is willing to sing a jingle for my company, we will consider licensing the phrase to her for use with certain non-competing products,\u201d Beggan said, adding Rise-N-Shine LLC would still seek a modest licensing fee from the bona fide billionaire.\n\nAnd now we wait for the dozens of other entrepreneurs who\u2019ve tried to trademark variations on the phrase to seek a shout-out from Jenner.", "description": "The founder of the 'Rise-N-Shine' supplement company has reportedly spoken out.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/jenner-shine-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
