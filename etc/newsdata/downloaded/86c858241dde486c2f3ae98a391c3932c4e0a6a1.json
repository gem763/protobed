But across shorter time scales, the local impacts of human activities on erosion can be measured.\n\nFor the new study, scientists wanted to determine whether human-influenced erosion can be measured at global scales. To find out, they analyzed the layers of sediment cores collected from 632 lakes from all over the globe.\n\n\u201cLake sediments are considered natural archives of erosion activities,\u201d Jean-Philippe Jenny, scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Germany, said in a news release. \u201cAll fluxes and processes removing soil, rock and dissolved materials result in chronological sediment layers that are accumulated and preserved at the bottom of lakes.\u201d\n\nUsing radiocarbon dating techniques, scientists were able to date the different layers of lake sediment and measure changes in the rate of sediment accumulation.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that by compiling data from so many lakes we see a general trend that shows an increasing sediment accumulation during the Holocene, or the last 10,000 years,\u201d said Pierre Francus, professor at the National Institute of Scientific Research in France.\n\nBy analyzing the pollen fossils trapped in ancient lake sediments, scientists were able to link accelerating erosion rates during the Holocene to land cover changes \u2014 specifically, deforestation.\n\n\u201cWe were excited to find that increased sediment accumulation 4,000 years ago coincided with a reduction of arboreal pollen derived from trees,\u201d Jenny said. \u201cThe tree pollen decrease reflects land-cover changes, in particular land clearances, e.g., for agriculture and settlement, that in turn are likely to lead to soil degradation and erosion.\u201d\n\nSophisticated statistical analysis confirmed the loss of trees was the primary driver of increased sedimentation in lake beds around the globe \u2014 evidence that human activities were already increasing erosion rates some 4,000 years ago.\n\nWhen researchers looked at the differences between regional erosion rates, they found patterns corresponding with socioeconomic developments. Soil erosion rates began accelerating in Europe, for example, earlier than in North America. Soil erosion in North America only started to increase after European colonizers had brought new agricultural practices to the continent.\n\nResearchers also found evidence of local sedimentation reductions at times and places linked with the construction of dams by the Roman and Chinese empires.\n\n\u201cWell before the more recent and abrupt influences by greenhouse gas emissions, human activities must have influenced the global environment already 4,000 years ago,\u201d Jenny said.\n\nMoving forward, the study\u2019s authors expect their findings \u2014 published this week in the journal PNAS \u2014 to be used by scientists making predictions about Earth\u2019s carbon cycle.\n\n!function(n){if(!window.cnx){window.cnx={},window.cnx.cmd=[];var t=n.createElement(\u2018iframe\u2019);t.display=\u2019none\u2019,t.onload=function(){var n=t.contentWindow.document;c=n.createElement(\u2018script\u2019),c.src=\u2019//cd.connatix.com/connatix.player.js\u2019,c.setAttribute(\u2018async\u2019,\u20191\u2032),c.setAttribute(\u2018type\u2019,\u2019text/javascript\u2019),n.body.appendChild(c)},n.head.appendChild(t)}}(document);\n\ncnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\ncnx({\n\nplayerId: \u201856098f0f-3e22-41b7-8dd5-b37443d7c53d\u2019\n\n, mediaId: \u20182e92d022-bac9-4063-b055-8e4de32918b7\u2019\n\n}).render(\u2018b1b051ead847468a8ce6d3b23c46506d\u2019);\n\n});", "description": "Oct. 29 (UPI) \u2014 New research suggests human activities resulted in accelerated soil erosion some 4,000 years ago.
