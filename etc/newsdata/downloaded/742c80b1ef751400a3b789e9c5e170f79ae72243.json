Security Council resolutions.\n\nNorth Korea test-fired a new type of submarine-launched ballistic missile Pukguksong-3 off Wonsan in the east of the country, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said Thursday.\n\nFollowing the missile launch, South Korea asked Japan for information based on GSOMIA, but not vice versa, South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong Doo has said.\n\nAs the missile fell close to Japan, South Korea needs Japanese data to analyze how the missile traveled after liftoff, including high-resolution reconnaissance satellite images, a Foreign Ministry source said.\n\nThe missile is likely to have been a mid-range submarine-launched ballistic missile that could have traveled up to 2,500 km on a normal trajectory, Defense Minister Taro Kono said Thursday.\n\nThe missile is believed to have followed a \"lofted trajectory,\" meaning it was launched at an angle to reach a high altitude but to limit its flight distance.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Japan is ready to share, as requested by South Korea, information related to the launch a day earlier of what North Korea claims to have been a submarine-launched ballistic missile, government sources said Thursday.
