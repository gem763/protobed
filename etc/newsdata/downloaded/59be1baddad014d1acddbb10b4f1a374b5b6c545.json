But Americans can now catch a glimpse of that underbelly in the alarming case of James Younger \u2014 a 7-year-old boy who may soon not be a boy.\n\nThis week, a Dallas, Texas, jury awarded sole custody of James to his mother, Anne Georgulas, who claims he is a girl named \u201cLuna.\u201d She has marked her son as \u201cfemale\u201d on medical records, begun to \u201csocially\u201d transition him and consulted with therapists about eventually chemically castrating him, according to his father, Jeffrey.\n\nThe senior Younger sees this program as \u201cchild abuse and the sexual mutilation of children.\u201d Since his marriage with Georgulas was annulled several years ago, the two have been joint managing conservators of their twin boys, James and Jude.\n\nBut when Georgulas sued to limit the father\u2019s access to James and mandate that Younger call him \u201cLuna,\u201d Younger fought her in court. This week, he lost his case for sole custody. James\u2019 social transition, and Georgulas\u2019 plans for puberty blockers, can continue apace, though on Thursday the judge in the case ruled that his father will have equal say in the matter \u2014 while also slapping a gag order against him.\n\nGeorgulas\u2019 original petition to remove Younger\u2019s parental rights declared the father had \u201cengaged in emotionally abusive behavior,\u201d which involved such atrocities as cutting James\u2019 hair and other \u201cnon-affirming actions.\u201d It added: \u201cAlthough unclear if this behavior rises to the level of family violence at this time, the father\u2019s aggression is becoming more common and more intense.\u201d\n\nAggression? Family violence? The only violence here is the trans movement\u2019s war on the English language, biology and reason, perfectly reflected in the mother\u2019s filing \u2014 and unchallenged by the mainstream media.\n\nYou won\u2019t read in The New York Times about the safety risks posed to James by his own mother \u2014 or hear about it on CNN. His father filmed him at age 3 wearing a kitchen towel fastened to his head, an attempt to imitate a girl\u2019s flowing locks. \u201cWho told you you were a girl?\u201d Younger asks in the video. \u201cMommy,\u201d the boy replies. \u201cShe buys my headbands, and she gives me hair clips. . . . She paints my nails. . . . She tells me I\u2019m a girl.\u201d\n\nIn court, Younger pointed out that James didn\u2019t fit the medical criteria for gender dysphoria. For one thing, he shows no signs of depression, per Younger. But an admission from Georgulas herself unwittingly revealed a larger hole in her argument.\n\nA court appointed amicus \u00adattorney, Stacy Dunlop, stated that \u201cLuna\u201d wasn\u2019t the first name that James requested. It was \u201cStarfire,\u201d the name of a character from the show \u201cTeen Titans Go!,\u201d which Georgulas considered ridiculous and encouraged him not to adopt.\n\nDr. Rebekka Ouer \u2014 a counselor recommended by the GENECIS clinic that first recommended James undergo \u201csocial transition\u201d \u2014 said this was wise. Her reasoning, described in The Texan: \u201cEven though affirmation is good, there were still some reasonable limits. No clear method of determining those reasonable efforts was suggested.\u201d\n\nIf even two trans advocates can admit that some limits are necessary, then we must ask: Why draw the line at Starfire but not at Luna? That Georgulas balked at Starfire indicates that the trans agenda rests on fluctuating standards and vague line-drawing.\n\nAnd it all involves a 7-year-old kid. The trans movement has already won concession after legal concession when it comes to the right of adults who subjectively identify with the opposite sex: They can choose to go as far as they please medically, and nearly all public \u00adinstitutions must bend to their demands for recognition.\n\nBut now activists and ideologues \u2014 including some parents \u2014 are bent on having children medically transition at ever-younger ages, including by subjecting them to processes that are irreversible.\n\nIf James is eventually chemically castrated, he will remain sterile for the rest of his life \u2014 even if he later decides that he is a male after all. Numerous studies have shown that the vast majority of children who say they\u2019re trans \u00addesist as they grow older.\n\nJeffrey Younger often wears a \u201cSave James\u201d T-shirt with a verse from Proverbs 31 printed on the back: \u201cSpeak up for those who cannot speak up for themselves.\u201d But perhaps what we need today is the slightly more urgent admonition from Jude, James\u2019 biblical kinsman: \u201cSave others by snatching them out of the fire.\u201d\n\nRamona Tausz is associate editor of First Things.\n\nTwitter: @RVTausz", "description": "The dark side of the trans movement was absent from CNN\u2019s LGBT town hall for Democratic candidates this month.
