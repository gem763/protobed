Cabrera just wanted that chance. (Eric Espada/Getty Images)\n\nIt was mid-August when Manager Dave Martinez approached the newest Washington National, Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera, and asked whether he could play first base. Cabrera had manned shortstop, second base and third base before, but he had never \u2014 not in 13 major league seasons, not in three minor league ones, not even back to childhood games in Venezuela \u2014 played first.\n\n\u201cPeople think it\u2019s going to be easy to play first because you just take the throw,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that easy.\u201d\n\nYet Cabrera understood his role. The Texas Rangers had designated the utility player for assignment days earlier, and before the Nationals officially signed him, Martinez called. The manager stressed he needed a sure glove capable of playing multiple positions. Cabrera was in; he wanted to play \u201cno matter what.\u201d He got a first baseman\u2019s mitt.\n\n[Bryce Harper fed up with taunts from Nationals fans: \u2018It\u2019s not right\u2019]\n\nThe Nationals will play in Tuesday\u2019s National League wild-card game in no small part due to the flexibility of their bench veterans, and their double-switch potential increases the organization\u2019s options for the 25-man roster. Howie Kendrick, Gerardo Parra and \u201cEl Cabby\u201d have played all over the diamond, even at positions they\u2019re not necessarily comfortable with, to spell a taxed teammate or stopgap a hole left by injury. They have delivered timely hits and steady gloves, and the coaching staff credits the team\u2019s versatility as a key marginal advantage.\n\n\u201cYou look at the teams that are really pushing [for the postseason] right now and making it, they can put numerous people in numerous positions,\u201d bench coach Chip Hale said last week. \u201cIt\u2019s really huge.\u201d\n\nThe trio started in primarily one position \u2014 Parra in left field, Kendrick at second and Cabrera at short \u2014 but as the games piled up, as their bodies stopped being so cooperative, they were forced to confront reality. They all want to be the everyday players they once were but understand it\u2019s impossible. So they evolved.\n\nShortstop\n\nCabrera started playing shortstop when he was 4 years old. His mother, Zunilde, played softball and taught Cabrera\u2019s older brother to throw the ball against the wall of their home in a small port city in northern Venezuela. Cabrera watched the ball hit the wall over and over and, soon enough, began the practice himself.\n\nThe kid looked up to Omar Vizquel, a fellow Venezuelan shortstop who had made it to the majors in 1989, and Cabrera later made a deal with his father that he would leave school for one year to try professional baseball. The teenager unwittingly emulated his idol. He and Vizquel had both signed with the Seattle Mariners, climbed the system and got traded to the Cleveland Indians. Cabrera debuted in 2007 and wore No. 13, a hallowed number among Venezuelan shortstops.\n\n[Svrluga: Playoff-clinching win was perfect bookend to the Bryce Harper chapter in Nationals history]\n\nHe spent eight seasons with the Indians, peaking in the early 2010s when he was a two-time all-star, and got traded to the Nationals at the trade deadline in 2014. His new team had a shortstop, Ian Desmond, so Cabrera shifted to second. The switch became permanent three seasons later when New York Mets brass told him the team had a hot prospect named Amed Rosario coming to the majors. Cabrera understood. He saw the new generation of shortstops rising to the majors, and he experienced the range he once had faltering.\n\nSecond base\n\nCabrera didn\u2019t mind the swap because he was the Mets\u2019 everyday second baseman for the rest of 2017 and the start of 2018. He settled into an everyday rhythm and provided steady defense while maintaining his contributions at the plate with an on-base-plus-slugging-percentage of about .825.\n\nThen the Mets dealt him to the Philadelphia Phillies at the trade deadline, and everything went haywire. Cabrera was still an everyday player, but he started at shortstop for a week, played third for most of the next and ping-ponged back and forth for the next month. The unpredictability jarred Cabrera. His on-base percentage dropped 50 points. But he looked around baseball and saw versatility and availability were becoming \u201cpart of the business.\u201d He realized that, even when he stopped being an everyday player, this skill set might keep him in the game.\n\n\u201cThat's when I started to think to prepare my mind, my body to play any position,\u201d he said.\n\nThird base\n\nThe Rangers had their middle infield set, but they needed someone at the hot corner. They signed Cabrera, and he played every day. He still didn\u2019t define himself as a utility player, but he knew this added another position to his repertoire.\n\n[MLB playoff bracket and schedule]\n\n\u201cThe more I play there the more I feel confident,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the bat, his most redeeming tool, slipped. He hit .235, and the Rangers designated him for assignment. They replaced Cabrera with a young prospect and a utility veteran just like him. In early August, Cabrera signed with the Nationals.\n\nHis offense surged, and he would later claim the starting second baseman spot from Brian Dozier. But Cabrera first proved his value as a utility player. He had returned to the status he held when trying to break into the majors; his first major league appearance was at third base, and his first start was at second.\n\nThe 33-year-old\u2019s days at shortstop seemed like a distant memory. Cabrera stood at his locker in the Nationals\u2019 clubhouse and sighed. He admitted he can no longer play the position he still loves.\n\n\u201cOld age, it\u2019s not easy,\u201d he said. He pinched his stomach. \u201cWhen I start playing in the big leagues, my weight was at 185 or something. I weigh 220, 218 right now. That makes a difference.\u201d\n\nFirst base\n\nNow Cabrera is a man without a position. He wants to stick around, so he plays wherever he\u2019s needed, knowing he\u2019s not the Nationals\u2019 second baseman of the future. He navigated his first start at first base, in Chicago against the Cubs, without an error, and he has shown a knack for the position in his two appearances since.\n\n[Nationals, perhaps a little hung over, keep on keeping on in quest for home field]\n\nThings are different there. The ball arrives much faster on the corners, but Cabrera credited his time at third in Texas for helping him adjust. He still finds the mechanics of the position challenging \u2014 little things such as the catch-and-tag of a pickoff or the timing of a toss to a pitcher running to cover first \u2014 but he\u2019s enjoying the process. He\u2019s adapting again.\n\n\u201cShortstop was my favorite position, but I mean, everything is in the past,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about what\u2019s going to happen now and tomorrow.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nPredicting the Nationals\u2019 wild-card roster\n\nIn Nationals\u2019 clincher, Max Scherzer\u2019s uneven outing offers more questions than answers\n\nBoswell: The Nationals earned their spot in the postseason, but they still have unfinished business", "description": "The veteran's ability to play multiple defensive positions and his timely hitting give the Nationals plenty of options heading into the postseason.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter", "Sam Fortier Is A Sports Reporter For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XHOtjMiyNukxp2RmHxohCJLbJCw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BT7HFDW4DUI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
