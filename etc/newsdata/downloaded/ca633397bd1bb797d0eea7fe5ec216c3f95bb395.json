Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019\n\nCritics disputed the president\u2019s tweet by pointing to basic definitions of a coup d\u2019etat, a violent illegal overthrow of the government by an opposing group, and impeachment, a legal process laid out in the Constitution. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential hopeful, even suggested Trump should not be allowed to make such a remark on Twitter, sharing his \u201cCOUP\u201d tweet with CEO Jack Dorsey.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTime to do something about this,\u201d she tweeted to Dorsey.\n\nGene Healy, a vice president at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, called Trump\u2019s comparison \u201cdumb and galling.\u201d He pointed out how Vice President Pence, a close ideological ally, would take office if the president were to be impeached, unlike in the illegal overthrow Trump\u2019s tweet evokes.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of coup would replace Donald Trump with his handpicked, duly elected, loyal-to-a-fault running mate? That\u2019s not a coup,\u201d Healy, also the author of \u201cIndispensable Remedy: The Broad Scope of the Constitution\u2019s Impeachment Power,\u201d told The Washington Post. \u201cSo it\u2019s a dumb thing to say, but it\u2019s something that is par for the course in terms of moronic political rhetoric.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201cCOUP\u201d tweet follows explosive, and at times threatening, comments Trump has made in attempt to discredit the impeachment inquiry. He has questioned whether House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) should be arrested for treason, an offense that can be punishable by death. He has ominously alluded to the same punishment while attacking the anonymous whistleblower, whom Trump called \u201calmost a spy.\u201d And he has suggested on Twitter that his impeachment could lead to civil war while quoting Southern Baptist megachurch pastor Robert Jeffress \u2014 who had just made a similar argument on \u201cFox & Friends Weekend.\u201d\n\n\u2018Beyond repugnant\u2019: GOP congressman slams Trump for warning of \u2018civil war\u2019 over impeachment\n\nLikewise, Trump\u2019s \u201cCOUP\u201d tweet came hours after his allies made the same case on Fox News.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is not an impeachment. This is a coup d\u2019etat\u201d Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who led impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton in 1998, said Tuesday on Fox News\u2019s \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPeter Navarro, Trump\u2019s trade adviser, later told Fox Business Network: \u201cThis is nothing less than an attempted coup d\u2019etat and end-run around the ballot box.\"\n\nBut Healy said the \u201ccoup\u201d argument is old news, a recycled political talking point spewed by both President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s surrogates in the aftermath of Watergate and by Democrats defending President Bill Clinton in the \u201990s.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not pretend Trump is the first to use this stupid comparison,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nDuring Clinton\u2019s impeachment, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), now chairman of the House Judiciary Committee tasked with investigating Trump, called it a \u201cpartisan coup d\u2019etat.\u201d It was a \u201cRepublican coup d\u2019etat,\u201d said former congressman John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), and it was \u201craw, unmasked, unbridled hatred and meanness that drives this impeachment coup d\u2019etat, this unapologetic disregard for the voice of the people,\u201d said Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) at the time.\n\nAD\n\nHillary Clinton, in fact, also said her husband experienced an \u201cattempted Congressional coup d\u2019etat\u201d in her 2003 memoir, \u201cLiving History.\u201d\n\nIt was already stale by then. For decades after Nixon\u2019s resignation, his closest allies continued to spin the same \u201ccoup d\u2019etat\u201d alternative history.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHaving been beaten at the polls in the crushing defeat of the McGovern-Shriver ticket, the left-wingers determined to reverse the election results by forcing Nixon out of the presidency by a process which amounted to a coup d\u2019etat,\u201d Spiro Agnew, Nixon\u2019s vice president who resigned in 1973, wrote in 1980.\n\nSome of Nixons most ardent supporters, notably his speechwriter, Patrick J. Buchanan are still making that case today. In June, Buchanan said that if impeachment ever happens to Trump, that would also be an \u201cattempted coup to overthrow a president by the losers of 2016.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis COUP business from Trump is the same nonsense that the revisionist Nixon gang pushed for years,\u201d Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said on Twitter, \u201cthat Nixon wasn\u2019t really guilty of anything, he was removed from office via a \u2018silent coup\u2019 of plotters determined to destroy Nixon\u2019s legacy and policies.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHealy said Trump notably diverges from past presidents threatened with impeachment by making the \u201cCOUP\u201d claim himself rather than leaving it to his surrogates. \u201cHe crossed a new rhetorical Rubicon,\u201d Healy said, while noting he finds the president\u2019s \u201ccivil war\u201d and \u201ctreason\u201d rhetoric considerably more troubling.\n\nIt\u2019s also not the first time Trump has claimed to be the victim of a coup. During then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump frequently retweeted or quoted Fox News pundits and Tom Fitton of the conservative legal watchdog group Judicial Watch, who said that the president was targeted in a \u201cDeep State coup effort.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere has only been one successful coup d\u2019etat in U.S. history, when white Neo-Confederates overthrew the multiracial local government in Wilmington, N.C., in 1898, killing at least dozens of black residents and politicians in the process.\n\nAD\n\nMaking light of a coup for political purposes, critics charged, failed to appreciate the gravity of actual coups such as this one or others around the world.\n\n\u201cA Coup is what took the lives of my two brothers during the first Liberian civil war,\u201d Wilmot Collins, mayor of Helena, Mont., who is a Liberian refugee and Democratic candidate for Senate, wrote on Twitter. \u201cWhat the President is facing is not even close to a Coup. It\u2019s called accountability. And it\u2019s long overdue.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The claim is recycled from the impeachment proceedings of Presidents Richard M.
