It's about stepping into Barbie's shoes in more ways than one.\n\nThere are many fictional houses and wardrobes we might have all imagined ourselves in. I for one still aspire to have Cher Horowitz' 1995 digital outfit selector in my future walk-in closet.\n\nREAD MORE: The robot wears Prada: what happens when AI starts giving out fashion tips?\n\nAnd I think a lot of us can admit to the fact that at some point in our formative years, a Barbie house was the mansion of our dreams for when we're \"thirty, flirty and thriving\".\n\nWell, guess what?\n\n\n\nBarbie's Malibu House was recently available on Airbnb as a once-in-a-lifetime booking and we're really disappointed we missed it.\n\n\n\nGlobal icon Barbie who's had over 200 careers, just added 'Host on Airbnb' to this extensive list of careers and accomplishments. Barbie is now handing over the keys to her Malibu Dreamhouse for the ultimate fan stay. Located in the heart of Malibu and overlooking the Pacific Ocean, the fabulous life-size Barbie Malibu Dreamhouse has been available to book since October 23 for this one-time reservation on 27 October - 29 October 2019.\n\nWith panoramic ocean views and beachy, glamorous decor, the home is a larger-than-life recreation of Barbie\u2019s signature style and hospitality. From her hobby room and personal cinema, to the infinity pool and outdoor meditation zone, every corner of the house reflects Barbie\u2019s lifetime as a role model to young women everywhere.\n\nThe two-night stay is available for only $60 (about R880 a night) a night plus taxes and fees to commemorate the Barbie brand\u2019s 60th anniversary celebrations.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE: This is the number of times the now 60-year-old Barbie was ahead of the curve when it came to empowering women\n\nBarbie\u2019s invited some of her most accomplished and entrepreneurial pals along to welcome and inspire her guests throughout the stay. Ibtihaj Muhammad, world-class fencing champion and inspirational role model (who even has her own Barbie Shero doll!), will give guests one-on-one fencing lessons, while pilot and aerospace engineer Jill Meyers will take them on a behind-the-scenes tour of Columbia Memorial Space Center to encourage them to aim for the stars.\n\nThere\u2019s so much to learn and try, but guests can count on time for R&R back at home. Because Barbie is always a little glam, celebrity hairstylist and girl boss Jen Atkin will stop by for hair makeovers with her Mane Addicts Creator Collective.\n\nAnd for a true taste of the farm-fresh and flavorful food native to California, renowned local chef Gina Clarke-Helm will provide a cooking lesson in Barbie\u2019s spacious kitchen.\n\nBarbie\u2019s home has plenty of space to relax and play and can accommodate up to four guests. The Mattel icon is excited to share the comfort of her home and to welcome new friends to her charming neighborhood.\n\nTo celebrate this unique offering, Airbnb will make a donation to the Barbie Dream Gap Project GoFundMe initiative, which aims to help level the playing field for young women so they can follow their dreams.\n\nImages supplied by PR on behalf of Airbnb.\n\nCompiled by Afika Jadezweni\n\nSign up to W24\u2019s newsletters so you don't miss out on any of our hot stories and giveaways.", "description": "It's not just about staying in the house for two nights.
