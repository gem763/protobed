We have been around the world and conquered the best races in Europe, so of course I\u2019m attached to her, and I love her. That chapter could close on Sunday and she means the world to me, and if it does end, of course it will hit me hard.\u201d\n\nTalking Horses: Enable tunes up for Arc hat-trick bid at Newmarket Read more\n\nDettori missed the winning ride on Treve in the 2013 Arc after breaking an ankle in a fall at Nottingham racecourse a few days before the race and he has been taking no chances in the run-up to Sunday\u2019s race. His last ride in public was aboard Lord North, the Cambridgeshire Handicap winner, at Newmarket last Saturday, although he has a handful of booked rides at Longchamp over the weekend before Enable\u2019s big moment at 15.05 BST on Sunday afternoon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a circus,\u201d Dettori said of the buildup in recent days, but quite rightly so, because she is trying to do what has never been done before and scale a mountain that has not been scaled before.\n\nThis, in racing terms, would be as big as Sir Steve Redgrave claiming five Olympic gold medals. There has been a media frenzy all over the world, because it is the biggest race.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t nervous. Of course I\u2019m nervous. I get nervous from the night before, and I get quite obnoxious, so my family kind of run away from me. But it is part and parcel of riding the favourite in the Arc.\u201d\n\nEnable is top-priced at 8-11, with Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Japan, the winner of the International Stakes at York in August, next in the betting at 6-1. Sottsass, the French Derby winner, is a 7-1 shot while another O\u2019Brien-trained runner, Magical, is alongside Charlie Appleby\u2019s Ghaiyyath, the recent 14-length winner of a Group One event in Germany, on 12-1.\n\n\u201cEverybody is going to turn up, and it will be hard-fought, so it\u2019s really fingers crossed,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cI\u2019ve got the expectation of the world on my shoulders, which is great. I\u2019d rather be in that position than not, so I will try to enjoy it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not physically as good as I was at 25, but I guess what I have lost in my physique I\u2019ve gained in experience and I\u2019m enjoying it a lot more. John [Gosden, Enable\u2019s trainer] is looking after me, and I\u2019m very grateful to him that he is not flogging me up and down the country every day.\n\n\u201cHe is keeping me for when it is important, which has helped me find myself in the position I am today.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe was the first at Longchamp following a \u20ac130m redevelopment programme and it left many racegoers disappointed amid reports of long queues for food, drinks and toilet facilities and shortages of beer and wine.\n\nThe prospect of seeing Enable\u2019s last race is still expected to tempt many thousands of British and Irish racing fans back to Paris this weekend however, in the hope that one of the most popular horses of recent decades will succeed where Treve failed four years ago, after two consecutive victories in the Arc.\n\n\u201cI fear Japan,\u201d Dettori added, \u201cbecause he is a Juddmonte [International] winner that is also a three-year-old, so he will get weight from us. The Arc is really all about her, though. It would put the icing on the cake of her career and make her an immortal horse of our generation if it happens.\u201d", "description": "Enable and Frankie Dettori primed for rare shot at Arc hat-trick", "authors": ["Greg Wood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ab5d93f00c8ba6761da5ca3f6c61cd488017d8c/197_230_3001_1801/master/3001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=50beb7c25f29c023fe941d00416d030b", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
