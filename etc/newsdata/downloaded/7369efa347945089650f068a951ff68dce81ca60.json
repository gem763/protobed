After it was disputed whether the injury had broken the bone, Adebowale was able to plead guilty to the lesser charge and avoid a trial.\n\n(Image: HOPE not hate)\n\nSasha Wass QC, mitigating, told the court Adebowale admitted hitting Mr Taplin when frustrated but did not break the bone.\n\nShe said: \"He accepted that he struck a blow, one blow, but he did not or he would not accept that he broke the jaw.\"\n\nMs Wass added that Adebowale suffers from \"chronic paranoid schizophrenia\" and was hearing voices telling him to attack Mr Taplin before the incident.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nShe said: \"He is clearly unwell, he clearly had a lapse in self control and he regained his self control and he immediately showed his remorse by writing a letter to Mr Taplin.\n\n\"His medication was not sufficient to deal with the psychotic state he experienced on July 20 of last year and as a result of that state he administered the blow.\"\n\nMr Justice Jay said his sentencing decision will not significantly affect the 28-year-old's immediate future.\n\n(Image: Gofundme)\n\n\"He has got another 39 or 40 years to go and may in fact never leave Broadmoor,\" he said.\n\nPassing down the eight-month sentence, Mr Justice Jay said: \"There was a dispute between you and Mr Taplin.\n\n\"I have absolutely no doubt Mr Taplin was in the right and you were in the wrong.\n\n\"What the CCTV clearly shows, that while Mr Taplin was in conversation, no doubt of work-related matters, you approached him from his left and on my interpretation of the evidence you delivered one hard blow.\n\n\"It was a combination of the illness and the stress that was working on your mind that I feel was another factor in your case.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMr Justice Jay accepted that Adebowale had heard voices before the attack.\n\n\"The injury would have been very painful for a period of time, possibly a considerable period of time and I hope you sincerely regret that.\"\n\nAfter serving his life sentence, Adebowale will serve half of the eight-month prison sentence before being released on licence.\n\nA further count of inflicting grievous bodily harm will lie on file.\n\n(Image: Roland Leon/Sunday Mirror)\n\nAdebowale was born in the UK, but has Nigerian parents.\n\nIn April this year he was said to be desperate to get out of HMP Wakefield, where he is serving a life sentence, and move to a Nigerian Jail.\n\nAn insider told The Sun: \"Michael hates Wakefield. It\u2019s stuffed full of lags who see him as a top target.\"\n\nLee's mum Lyn said: \"He should serve his sentence here and not try to exploit the law for a cushier life.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nIn June we told how a drugs baron who was jailed for orchestrating a coke and cannabis distribution network was caught up in a brawl with the killers when they were in high security nick Belmarsh.\n\nUnderworld kingpin John Anslow \u2013 the mobster whose jail escape made national headlines - had a neighbouring cell near the pair.\n\nThe fight was allegedly the culmination of simmering bad blood between him and the terrorists after he became increasingly agitated over the pair\u2019s loud, all night conversations.\n\nThe Black Country drugs baron, who is serving a 22 year sentence, got the better of the brawl, his father, John Senior, claimed.\n\nHis dad said: \"All night and all day they were shouting.
