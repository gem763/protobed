The incident is likely to fuel the civil unrest.\n\nAccording to the Post, police fired two live rounds, meaning at least five shots went out during the protests.\n\nThe demonstrations descended into chaos earlier in the day, as police fired tear gas and water cannons to dispel the huge crowds, some of whom responded by throwing bricks and petrol bricks.\n\nHong Kong, a former British colony, was returned to China in 1997 under an agreement known as \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d which allowed the city to retain a \u201chigh-degree of autonomy\u201d for 50 years. The agreement expires in 2047.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "It marks the 18th straight week of pro-democracy protests.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Hong-Kong-3.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
