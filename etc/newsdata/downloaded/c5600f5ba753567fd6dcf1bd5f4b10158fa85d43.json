Fifteen seasons later, they returned to partake in the club\u2019s most historic moment yet.\n\nThe former batterymates threw and caught the first pitch before Game 3 of the World Series Friday night at Nationals Park, the building\u2019s first-ever World Series game.\n\nCordero, the team\u2019s first closer in 2005, spent six of his seven MLB seasons with the Montreal Expos and Washington Nationals from 2003 to 2008. Schneider played five years with the Expos and three with the Nationals.\n\nBoth ex-players were able to wear actual game-worn uniforms their dads had saved, they said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge honor to be able to come back and be a part of something like this,\u201d Cordero said before the game. \u201cTo be part of that first team in \u201805 that brought baseball back after so many years, and then to be able to be invited to throw out the first pitch in the World Series and the first one, like Brian said, in 86 years, that\u2019s a pretty special honor.\u201d\n\nBefore Cordero and Schneider took their positions at the mound and plate, Col. Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, also threw out a ceremonial pitch.\n\nFormer astronaut Buzz Aldrin throws out the first pitch for Game 3 of the 2019 World Series! pic.twitter.com/OiJwW49k5h \u2014 FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 25, 2019\n\nLocal singer D.C.
