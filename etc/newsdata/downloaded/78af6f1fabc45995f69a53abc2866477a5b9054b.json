Trump currently holds an 88% Gallup approval rating within the Republican party, he already has the backing of the RNC, and at least four states are canceling their GOP primaries altogether.\n\nBut if Trump's challengers make a splash and engage him in a nasty intra-party fight, it could weaken him going into the general election.\n\nRead more:'Cowards run from fights': 3 Republican presidential candidates join forces to blast Trump 'loyalists' for shutting them out of primaries\n\nWho will be on stage\n\nFormer Gov. Bill Weld of Massachusetts and former Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois will debate at Business Insider's New York City headquarters representing two different wings of the Republican Party's past.\n\nWeld, who served as Massachusetts' moderate Republican governor announced his campaign in April, is challenging Trump from the center \u2014 but has failed to generate much buzz for his campaign.\n\nWalsh, on the other hand, is a bombastic former one-term Tea Party congressman turned conservative talk show host.\n\nHe's using his media savvy and hard-hitting approach to argue Trump is betraying traditional conservative values by making constant false and misleading statements, overseeing an explosion of the national debt, and cozying up to authoritarian leaders at the expense of US allies.\n\nTrump himself declined our invitation to participate, as did former governor and congressman Mark Sanford of South Carolina, the other candidate challenging Trump in the GOP primary.\n\nThe debate will be moderated by Insider Inc. Founder & CEO Henry Blodget, Politics Editor Anthony Fisher, and Columnist Linette Lopez.\n\nWhat time the debate starts and how to watch it\n\nThe debate will run from 7 PM to 8:30 PM EST on September 24, and will be exclusively live-streamed on Business Insider Today's Facebook Watch page.\n\nBe sure to follow Business Insider Today on Facebook.\n\nRead more:\n\nJoe Walsh wants to beat Trump and save the Republican party.
