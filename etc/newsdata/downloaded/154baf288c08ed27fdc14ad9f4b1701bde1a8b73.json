My sister wasn\u2019t a match either and so we are waiting, because all we can do is wait.\n\n\u201cThe NHS has very strict criteria for who is at the top of the list and because of reasons of age and so on my father isn\u2019t a priority.\n\n\u201cWe have no complaint about that. It\u2019s absolutely right that younger people are given a priority - that is the way it should be.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\u201cBut it is on your mind all the time and there is nothing you can do but wait and try to accept what can happen.\u201d\n\nJames was interviewed by Event magazine ahead of the release of his new album Once Upon A Mind.\n\nIt includes a ballad called Monsters - about the pain of a son saying goodbye to his father at the end of his life.\n\nHe said: \u201cI just played it to him. Just the two of us in a room. He listened and he said, \u2018That\u2019s the way it is\u2019.\n\n\u201cI can write a song about how I feel but I find expressing emotions one-to-one very difficult.\n\n\u201cClassic public schoolboy. Not really taught to say what you feel.\u201d", "description": "Singer reveals veteran father Charles Blount is on transplant waiting list that favours younger patients", "authors": ["Mark Jefferies", "Image", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20571613.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS191596765.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
