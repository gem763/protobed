They\u2019re not going to refuse me. Believe me.\u201d\n\nPressed further by Baier, Trump declared:\n\nI\u2019m a leader. I\u2019m a leader. I\u2019ve always been a leader. I\u2019ve never had any problem leading people. If I say do it, they\u2019re going to do it. That\u2019s what leadership is all about.\n\nIn the final debate with Hillary Clinton on Oct. 19, 2016, Chris Wallace of Fox News pressed Trump to announce that he would \u201cabsolutely accept the result of this election.\u201d Trump\u2019s answer:\n\nI will look at it at the time. I\u2019m not looking at anything now. I\u2019ll look at it at the time. What I\u2019ve seen \u2014 what I\u2019ve seen is so bad. First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing.\n\nTrump then claimed that the results could be corrupted because there are \u201cmillions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn\u2019t be registered to vote.\u201d Not only that, but his opponent \u201cshouldn\u2019t be allowed to run. It\u2019s crooked \u2014 she\u2019s, she\u2019s guilty of a very, very serious crime. She should not be allowed to run.\u201d\n\nFinally, Trump concluded the exchange: \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that I will tell you at the time. I\u2019ll keep you in suspense. O.K.?\u201d\n\nOr consider what Trump has said while president. On March 12, 2019, a month before publication of the Mueller Report, Trump told Breitbart, the hard right populist news site:\n\nYou know, the left plays a tougher game, it\u2019s very funny. I actually think that the people on the right are tougher, but they don\u2019t play it tougher. O.K.? I can tell you, I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump \u2014 I have the tough people, but they don\u2019t play it tough until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.\n\nAnd on Monday, Trump strengthened the case that he is willing to burn the house down, posting a series of tweets quoting Robert Jeffress, pastor of the First Baptist Church in Dallas, from an appearance on Fox News earlier that day.\n\nHere\u2019s what Jeffress said:\n\nI\u2019ve literally spoken to thousands and thousands of evangelical Christians, I have never seen them more angry over any issue than this attempt to illegitimately remove this president from office, overturn the 2016 election and negate the votes of millions of evangelicals in the process. And if the Democrats are successful in removing the president from office, I\u2019m afraid it will cause a Civil War-like fracture in this nation from which this country will never heal.\n\nNow Trump is conducting an all-out assault on the impeachment process, calling it a coup in a pair of tweets posted on Tuesday:\n\nAs I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!\n\nAll of this raises a couple of questions: What drives the depth and intensity of support for Trump? And how far are those supporters willing to go to keep him in the White House?\n\nExtensive evidence suggests that the passion of Trump\u2019s loyalists is, to a considerable extent, rooted in what they perceive as racial and cultural threat. Polls and surveys from Pew, N.P.R. and the Public Religion Research Institute show that 55 percent of whites believe they are discriminated against, that a plurality of whites (46 percent) believes that a majority-minority nation will \u201cweaken American culture\u201d and that once dominant white Christians are no longer a majority.", "description": "It\u2019s a loaded question \u2014 with no obvious answer.", "authors": ["Thomas B.
