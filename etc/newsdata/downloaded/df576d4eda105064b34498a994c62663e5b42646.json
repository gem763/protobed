C4ISRNET reports that as of this June, the USA\u2019s Strategic Automated Command and Control System (SACCS) has transitioned to a \u201chighly secure solid state digital storage solution.\u201d SACCS is one of the US nuclear force\u2019s ways of sending messages between nuclear command centers and the field.\n\nThe US nuclear force had originally planned on phasing out the system by the end of 2017, after a government report had raised concerns about the use of the outdated technology the previous year. C4ISRNET notes that the report had also called for the modernization of various other portable and desktop terminals, as well as \u201cport expansion processors,\u201d but it\u2019s unclear whether this work has been completed.\n\nThe old machines had to be repaired and soldered by hand because they can\u2019t be easily replaced\n\nThe antiquated system, which runs on an IBM / Series 1 computer, has its advantages. It\u2019s entirely offline, for example, which cuts off a key attack vector. However, that can\u2019t make up for the challenges of maintaining such an old system. C4ISRNET describes how the system\u2019s maintainers have to literally use soldering irons to fix the old equipment, because you can\u2019t swap out components when they break, and The New York Times notes that the last 8-inch floppy disk was manufactured five years ago, making them increasingly difficult to source.\n\nAccording to Tom Persky, a floppy disk expert quoted by the NYT, it\u2019s surprisingly common to find floppy disks still in old industrial machines and medical devices. If an expensive machine is designed to be used for multiple decades, it\u2019s not cost-effective to immediately replace it the second a newer storage medium becomes available. Physical media may be becoming an increasingly rare sight for consumers, but elsewhere it\u2019s likely to stick around for decades.", "description": "The US military has finally ended the use of 8-inch floppy disks for coordinating the country\u2019s nuclear forces.
