Twitter announced that it would support Catalyst at this year\u2019s WWDC in June, though other companies like Netflix have been less enthusiastic. Twitter is by far the most notable Catalyst app so far.\n\nIn Twitter\u2019s case, it\u2019s not like the new Mac app is a straight port of the iPad app running in a window \u2014 the UI is mostly different overall. But it doesn\u2019t quite feel native to the Mac, either. It looks pretty ridiculous in full-screen (as it does on the iPad, to be fair), and the Mac-style toolbar visually clashes with Twitter\u2019s own below it.\n\nStill, hey, new Twitter app for Mac. That\u2019s something. Though it is also worth pointing out that, even more so than with most recent macOS releases, you might want to hold off on updating Catalina until you\u2019re really sure it won\u2019t break anything.", "description": "A new Twitter app is now available in the Mac App Store, but only for users running the new version of macOS, Catalina.
