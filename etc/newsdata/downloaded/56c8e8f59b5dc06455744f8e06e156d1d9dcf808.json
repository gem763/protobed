There is a 90 per cent fatality rate (pictured: health workers in\n\nThe virus is mainly associated with fruit bats in West and Central Africa. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is currently grappling with the world's second largest Ebola epidemic on record.\n\nIt has claimed more than 2,000 lives, with 3,000 confirmed infections since the outbreak was declared on August 1, 2018.\n\nDr Redding's computer programme tracks how changes to ecosystems and societies combine to affect the spread of the infectious disease.\n\nBy combining the impact of climate, land use and human populations factors, it came up with the ones that have previously occurred even with no case data - demonstrating the high level of accuracy.\n\nIt also found future outbreaks are 1.6 times more likely in scenarios with increased warming and slower socioeconomic development.\n\nMore than two thirds of all infectious diseases originate in animals including Ebola, Lassa fever and West Nile virus.\n\nThese diseases contribute to the global health and economic burden that disproportionately affects poor communities.\n\nThe World Bank estimates the 2014 Ebola outbreak which killed more than 11,300 people in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone cost the three countries many billions of dollars.\n\nA child is vaccinated against Ebola in Beni, Congo, one of the west African countries which has been hardest hit by the disease\n\nThis was due to infrastructure breakdown, mass migration, crop abandonment and a rise in endemic disease due to overrun healthcare systems.\n\nDr Redding's team analysed how humans interact with wildlife to develop the model, which could also be adapted for other zoonotic diseases.\n\nCo-author Professor Kate Jones, who is based in the same lab, said: 'Importantly, our model is flexible enough to allow us to predict Ebola outbreaks in alternative, simulated versions of the world.\n\nWhy are climate models hard to predict? The main problem with climate models is uncertainty. In particular, something called the 'equilibrium climate sensitivity' measure has been causing scientists a headache. This is a highly influential measure that describes how much the planet will warm if carbon dioxide doubles and the Earth's climate adjusts to the new state of the atmosphere. Studies have found a wide range of possibilities for this key measure \u2014 somewhere between 1.5 and 4.5\u00b0C, with 3\u00b0C. Most scientists try to constrain ECS by looking at historical warming events. For the last 25 years, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the ultimate authority on climate science, has settled on a 'likely' range of 1.5\u00b0C to 4.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F to 8.1\u00b0F). Warming less than 1\u00b0C is 'extremely unlikely' and more than 6\u00b0C is considered 'very unlikely', the panel has concluded. However, some scientists dispute this figure.\n\n'For example, we examine a set of plausible future environments and show stark differences in how Ebola responds to the best and worst case scenarios of future climate change and poverty alleviation.\n\n'Ebola risk appears to worsen in future versions of our planet that have higher climate change and worse cooperation between societies.\n\n'Working together to improve healthcare resources, which can contain dangerous diseases such as Ebola, appears to strongly reduce future risk, and this offers an important option for preventing future disease cases.\n\n'We hope our model will help policy makers address this challenge.'\n\nIt could suggest locations which should be prioritised for disease surveillance to prevent future disasters, added the researchers.\n\nPrevious Ebola outbreaks affected relatively small numbers of people.\n\nThe WHO (World Health Organisation) has said countries and other bodies need to focus on preparing for new deadly epidemics.\n\nEbola is a virus that initially causes sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat. It progresses to vomiting, diarrhoea and both internal and external bleeding.\n\nPeople are infected when they have direct contact through broken skin, or the mouth and nose, with the blood, vomit, faeces or bodily fluids of someone with Ebola. Patients tend to die from dehydration and multiple organ failure.\n\nThe WHO says climate change, emerging diseases, exploitation of the rainforest, large and highly mobile populations, weak governments and conflict are making outbreaks more likely to occur and more likely to swell in size once they did.", "description": "Several countries that have never experienced the problem, including Nigeria which is home to 191 million people, are particularly at risk - both now and in the years ahead.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/16/19748374-0-image-a-76_1571153767402.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
