REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nTensions over Turkey\u2019s military offensive in Northern Syria also simmered, although the lira recovered some ground from five-month lows Tuesday after Washington announced sanctions against Ankara. The currency caught a break partly on the feeling the sanctions, mainly against Turkey\u2019s energy and defence ministries, could have been worse, but also because Turkish state banks have been widely seen intervening to cushion the lira\u2019s fall; some estimates that put the spending as high as $2 billion on Monday.\n\nHowever, Washington also announced plans to re-impose steel tariffs immediately and halted negotiations on a $100 billon trade deal. And with little sign of Turkey\u2019s halting its military operation against former U.S. allies \u2013 the Kurdish SDF forces \u2013 the prospect of a gradual ratcheting up of sanctions is very real as President Donald Trump comes under intense domestic pressure, after effectively giving Turkey the green light to advance with his abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops last week.\n\nMore broadly, markets grew sceptical of the latest advances in the U.S.-China trade talks. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that an additional round of tariffs on Chinese imports will probably be imposed if a comprehensive trade deal with China has not been reached by Trump\u2019s meeting with China\u2019s President Xi at next month\u2019s APAC summit in Chile.\n\nThe U.S. third-quarter earnings season is about to begin and should reveal some of the damage from the escalation of the tariff row during the quarter. Wall Street stocks ended in the red overnight and Asia\u2019s major markets were also down first thing Tuesday. Shanghai stocks fell 0.5% and Hong Kong and Seoul benchmarks were flat. Tokyo played catch-up as it returned from a holiday on Monday and rose more than 1 percent.\n\nAfter dour export and import readings for September, China said on Tuesday its factory-gate prices declined last month at the fastest pace in more than three years. U.S. Treasury yields turned lower again, after the yield curve between three-month and 10-year bonds turned positive on Monday for the first time in five months but slipped back to negative again today.\n\nSterling gained on Tuesday as traders continued to bet that either a Brexit deal would be reached by this week\u2019s European Union summit or a delay in the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline would be agreed. The pound had given back some of last week\u2019s gains on Monday but popped higher again after the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said an agreement was still possible this week even if it was proving difficult.\n\nThe pound and euro stocks were also buoyed by reports overnight that the EU is considering an emergency summit after this week but before Oct. 31 to get the deal done. Elsewhere in currency markets, euro/dollar nudged above $1.10. China\u2019s offshore yuan slipped, taking the emerging-market currency index lower.\n\nIn European corporate news, Kloeckner & Co\u2019s shares were sliding 8% in Frankfurt after the steel company warned on profits, the latest European industrial company to signal it was suffering from trade tensions and faltering demand. Consumer-facing companies were faring better: shares in Germany\u2019s Hellofresh was seen up 6% after it raised its profit outlook.\n\nIn the UK, housebuilder Bellway\u2019s shares were expected to rise 2% after a positive statement. The recruiter Hays reported no growth in net fees. Rivals PageGroup and Robert Walters warned on profits last week. Among industrials, Renishaw shares were seen down 20% after the British engineering group\u2019s profits plunged %; Vesuvius was expected to drop 10% after a profit warning. European companies with exposure to Turkey were in focus after the U.S. sanctions, among them BBVA, UniCredit, BNP Paribas, Telia and Lufthansa.\n\n\u2014 A look at the day ahead from EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan.
