Sometimes, the thefts can be completed in less than 20 seconds.\n\nPolice in the West Midlands say the Range Rover Evoque is the current target of choice with thieves and are telling owners to go to extra lengths to protect their vehicles.\n\nThis Range Rover Evoque was one of a number stolen by keyless car thieves in the Midlands\n\nHigh-tech car thieves working together can steal keyless cars in under 20 seconds\n\nLuke Simmons had his Range Rover stolen less than 12 hours after it he bought it last month\n\nThe force tweeted: 'We are currently seeing a surge of thefts targeting Range Rover Evoque vehicles. If you have one please consider adding addition security such as steering locks, OBD blockers, immobilisers, trackers, faraday bags for the keys if the vehicle is keyless entry & parking bollards etc.'\n\nOBD blockers cut out unauthorised communication to vehicles, preventing thieves from reprogramming keys. Similarly, faraday bags, named after the inventor of the Faraday cage, are bags in which keys can be placed to prevent radio frequency signals being received.\n\nOne of the victims of the recent spate was electrician Luke Simmons, whose Range Rover was taken by thieves exploiting keyless technology just 12 hours after he bought it last month.\n\nMr Simmons, 31, of Newark, Nottinghamshire, said: 'I don\u2019t spend much on stuff, but I wanted to treat myself and now it\u2019s gone. It\u2019s gutting. I don\u2019t know how they were able to steal it. The car is keyless. I\u2019m just baffled.\u2019\n\nLast week, West Midlands Police chief constable Dave Thompson criticised manufacturers of keyless cars after a crash in which one of his officers was nearly killed.\n\nFootage from Birmingham earlier this year showed the moment three masked thieves stole a \u00a360,000 Range Rover in just 40 seconds - while its unsuspecting owners are asleep upstairs\n\nMr Thompson said urgent action was needed following a rise in thefts of high-powered luxury cars for parts.\n\nHis force is now lobbying the government over concerns criminal gangs are buying insurance write-offs from salvage auctions and then stealing cars for the parts they need to fix them and sell them on for a hefty profit.\n\nIt came after PC Gareth Phillips was left with life threatening injuries when he was run over by a car thief as he tried to escape.\n\nWest Midlands Police said its research had found that around five times more vehicles - mainly luxury makes such as Audi, BMW and Range Rover - are sold at auction as 'repairable write-offs', compared to write-offs, to be scrapped for spare parts.\n\nIt believes this shortage of parts is behind a spate of violent car jackings for spares rather than the criminals buying expensive factory-made parts from manufacturers.\n\nRange Rover thief Mubashar Hussain (left) was jailed last week after he hijacked a police BMW and knocked down Pc Gareth Phillips (right) in Birmingham", "description": "Police in the West Midlands say the Range Rover Evoque is the current target of choice with the thieves and are telling owners to go to extra lengths to protect their vehicles.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett", "Crime Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/09/19982368-0-image-a-8_1571647627447.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
