In her research, Bryanton studied older women who are living on their own to learn what supports they need to continue to be happy and independent.\n\n\u201cThe women in this study reveal that they are not frail, dependent victims who are a burden to society,\u201d she says. \u201cWe think of aging as a problem, [but] aging is a normal process of life.\u201d Bryanton believes that ageism takes away a person\u2019s potential. \u201cDon\u2019t let ageist ideas rule your life. If it\u2019s something you want to do, do it. There is no age limit on potential,\u201d she stresses.\n\nMeet eight remarkable women aged 70 and over who would surely agree.\n\nHazel McCallion, 98\n\nHazel McCallion Photo: Canadian Press\n\nHazel McCallion served as Mississauga\u2019s mayor for 36 years and only retired from the position at 93. She now serves as the chancellor of Ontario\u2019s Sheridan College. McCallion says that some of her most productive years came after she turned 65.\n\nJust last year, she wrote an opinion piece for the Globe and Mail titled \u201cAgeism is getting old. Let\u2019s end it,\u201d in which she emphasizes that older people have an important role to play in their communities.\n\nStill feisty as ever, Hazel (Hurricane Hazel) McCallion celebrated her 98th birthday this past Valentine\u2019s Day and decided that the best way to mark the occasion was to go rock climbing.\n\nIris Apfel, 97\n\nIris Apfel Photo: Canadian Press\n\nAmerican fashion icon Iris Apfel is celebrated for her fearless sense of style, combining bold hues with statement jewellery and her signature oversized glasses. A self-described \u201cgeriatric starlet,\u201d she continues to influence fashion and design.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2006, a collection of her garments and accessories was been shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Apfel was also the subject of a 2014 documentary, Iris, that was nominated for a slew of awards.\n\n\u201cI never think about my age,\u201d she told CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s just a number \u2026 I love what I do and I put my heart and soul into it.\u201d\n\nMargaret Atwood, 79\n\nAside from being an acclaimed novelist, essayist and poet, Canadian literary icon Margaret Atwood is also a book critic, professor, environmental activist and even an inventor.\n\nSince her 1985 novel The Handmaid\u2019s Tale was adapted into an Emmy-winning television series, Atwood has been busier than ever. This fall, she will release a sequel to the dystopian classic titled The Testaments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting at this point in my life [where I\u2019m] \u2018remarkably spry for her age.\u2019 So I\u2019d rather have that than \u2018remarkably decrepit for her age,\u2019\u201d Atwood told CBC News. \u201cI am the age I am and that gives you a certain advantage too, because I remember a lot of things.\u201d\n\nCarmen Dell\u2019Orefice, 88\n\nCarmen Dell'Orefice Photo: Canadian Press\n\nCarmen Dell\u2019Orefice is known as the world\u2019s oldest working model. At 14, she posed for Salvador Dal\u00ed and, at 15, was featured on the cover of Vogue. She has been considered a timeless beauty ever since.\n\nBut, as Dell\u2019Orefice said in a recent interview, she has modelled for the most magazine covers in the last 25 years of her career.\n\n\u201cToday I am in a territory that business considers unmarketable: age and white hair. Slowly, however, I started to own that territory little by little because I stood up for age.\u201d\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg, 86\n\nU.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg led a remarkable life even before she was appointed to the country\u2019s highest court in 1993, where she continues to sit.\n\nMore than three decades earlier, she graduated at the top of her class at law school but struggled to find a job in a man\u2019s world. This roadblock prompted her to become a law professor and pursue her interest in gender equality with the American Civil Liberties Union. She would go on to become a lynchpin in the fight for women\u2019s equality in America.\n\nIn her late 60s, Ginsburg dealt with ageism head-on, refusing to step down so that a younger Democrat could replace her. Today, she continues to face ageist scrutiny about her capabilities, even after enduring cancer \u2014 twice \u2014 and recently recovering from a fall that resulted in three broken ribs.\n\n\u201cMy senior colleague Justice John Paul Stevens, he stepped down when he was 90. So, I think I have at least five more years,\u201d Ginsburg told CNN last year.\n\nErnestine Shepherd, 83\n\nErnestine Shepherd Photo: Getty Images\n\nErnestine Shepherd, also known as \u201cthe bench-pressing golden girl,\u201d is an American bodybuilder who was named the oldest competitive female bodybuilder in the world at the age of 74.\n\nShepherd only developed her interest in the sport in her late 50s and now lives by the mantra, \u201cAge is nothing but a number.\u201d\n\nAt 83, Shepherd has stopped competing, but she\u2019s still an active bodybuilder and works as a personal trainer, motivating people and educating them about keeping in shape. \u201cIf ever there were an anti-aging pill, you\u2019d have to call it exercise,\u201d she has said.\n\nMargaret Trudeau, 70\n\nMargaret Trudeau is a mental health advocate, author and performer who has also worked as a photographer and television talk show host. Formerly married to Pierre Trudeau, the 15th Prime Minister of Canada, she is, of course, also the mother of current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nIn 2015, she published a book, The Time of Your Life: Choosing a Vibrant, Joyful Future in which she encourages people entering their \u201cthird act\u201d to stay as involved and healthy as possible.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m advocating [for] is a much more proactive [approach] of fighting into your old age, of taking it on, of still doing everything you\u2019ve always done,\u201d Trudeau told CBC News. \u201cMaybe not as well or as fast, but the things you love, don\u2019t stop doing them, don\u2019t give up on your sense of wonder.\u201d\n\nPhyllis Sues, 96\n\nMusician and former Broadway dancer Phyllis Sues became passionate about trapeze at 75, tried yoga for the first time at 85 (she now practices every day) and took up skydiving at 90.\n\nShe is now writing her first book, currently titled 20 Tips to Change your Life, which she hopes will inspire anyone \u2014 young or old \u2014 who wants to live a healthier life.\n\n\u201cAging can be exciting, creative, active and even daring,\u201d Sues has said. \u201cIt takes work, desire, and most of all loving what you do every day, every minute, every second, even if it\u2019s washing dishes.\u201d\n\nWatch Never Too Old.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cbc Docs"], "top_image": ""}
