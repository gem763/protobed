Some of the flights between Australia and Dubai can be almost 14 hours. Many of our first class customers are connecting to Australia, through Dubai, from the United Kingdom, Europe or even the Americas.\n\n'That means many customers will keep to their own schedules - I might be serving one first class customer a Gruyere Omelette while a different passenger enjoys a herb crusted rack of lamb with a glass of Bordeaux.\n\n'That is the beauty of first class - being able to tailor a flight to the individual customers' needs or preferences.'\n\nBEAUTY SCHOOL GRADUATES\n\nFlight attendants - both women and men - are required to attend a beauty school to learn about the airline's makeup and hair guidelines.\n\n'The \"look\" is an integral part of Emirates brand image, which is why we have a dedicated Image and Uniform team to ensure hair and make-up standards are followed by cabin crew,' Alexandra said.\n\nAlexandra said Emirates also has hair standards for the gentlemen; must be neat, conservative and styled away from the face. Their hair must not be overload with gel or wax and be neatly trimmed at all times and not touch the collar of their shirt\n\nWhat kind of 'training' do Emirates flight attendants do? Alexandra told Daily Mail Australia they all begin our career in economy class. 'We are then selected to move into the business and first class cabins over a number of years, based on our performance.

This involves 25 hours of preparatory work, such as reading modules, watching training videos highlighting premium customer service and home-based assignments,' she said.

This includes attention to detail in plating of meals, pairing Emirates\u2019 world class wine selection with our food to give our customers a premium service.

However, we are informed what items we need to wear.\n\n'We often get asked if there is a particular shade that we as crew must use, but it's not specified, what we need to know is the colour must match the red in the uniform and not be glossy.'\n\nFor the hair standards, flight attendants must ensure their hair is clean and neatly presented at all times.\n\n'Any loose strands around the face and neckline must be pinned up and that our chosen hairstyle must not affect the correct positioning of our hat,' she said.\n\n'Various styles such as, French roll, up roll, or the classic bun are permitted.'\n\nMale flight attendants are also expected to meet hair standards.\n\n'Their hair must be neat, conservative and styled away from the face. Their hair must not be overload with gel or wax and be neatly trimmed at all times and not touch the collar of their shirt,' Alexandra said.", "description": "Emirate's flight attendant Alexandra Cosoff, from Queensland, has lifted\u00a0the lid on what it really takes to work for first class passengers at 35,000 feet.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/06/19525576-0-image-a-17_1570686100963.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
