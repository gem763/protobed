The signatories said the campaign could lead to the \u201cdrying up of streams and rivulets, and destruction of wildlife habitats\u201d.\n\nThe Cauvery is an endangered river in southern India.\n\nThe letter praised DiCaprio\u2019s work in \u201cpromoting rights of indigenous communities, protecting wildlife, case sensitively promoting conservation strategies, and, needless to state, pushing for clear action to tackle global warming\u201d.\n\nBut the charities added: \u201cIt appears to us, the Coalition for Environmental Justice in India, however, that you may not have been appropriately advised in supporting the Cauvery Calling campaign.\u201d\n\nThe letter continued: \u201cThis is not a programme that will protect Cauvery, her forests, her biodiversity, her children, and her children\u2019s children. It will certainly not save Cauvery.\u201d\n\nThe campaign was launched by the Isha Foundation, created by \u201cSadhguru\u201d Jaggi Vasudev.\n\nSadhguru is a celebrity mystic who tours the world attending Hollywood events, offering spiritual advice and meditation tips, and has endorsements from numerous Bollywood celebrities.\n\nThe guru has made various controversial public statements, referring to one Muslim student as \u201cTaliban\u201d and calling liberals \u201cfanatics.\u201d\n\nThe Cauvery Calling campaign collects donations online to plant 2.42bn trees along the banks of the Cauvery river. According to a ticker on its website, it has already collected enough funds to plant 40m trees.\n\nBut activists have said the tree-planting drive is too simplistic.\n\n\u201cThe river has 81,000 square metres of watershed shared between four states,\u201d said Leo Saldanha, co-ordinator of the Bangalore-based Environment Support Group.\n\nSaldhana said that different stretches of land in the region had different requirements and that blanket tree-planting could cause enormous environmental degradation and a loss to farmer livelihoods.\n\nDiCaprio posted an endorsement of the Cauvery Calling campaign on his Facebook page on Saturday, and his environmental charity Earth Sense has previously hosted the spiritual leader at an event in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cSadhguru has all kinds of endorsement from politicians to film stars and billionaires,\u201d Saldahna said. \u201cEnvironmental organisations are trying to develop proper, ground-up strategies to address these complex issues. They don\u2019t work with us because we don\u2019t use populism. We don\u2019t use religion. This is an evangelical religious foundation. DiCaprio is a great actor and an intelligent conversationalist, but he is lending a hand and globally legitimising it.\u201d\n\nDiCaprio and his foundation have previously come under scrutiny in Malaysia, after a Department of Justice probe into alleged links to a money laundering scheme that reportedly supported his environmental foundation and his film The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nSadhguru\u2019s organisation has been criticised previously by India\u2019s comptroller and auditor general for disregarding environmental and humanitarian laws and even building its Coimbatore headquarters on protected forest land known for its elephant corridor. The foundation has denied that it was built on an elephant corridor.\n\nEnvironmentalists have also filed a court case against the Isha Foundation, alleging that the project started collecting donations for the programme before receiving clearances from state governments to plant trees.\n\nDiCaprio\u2019s publicists did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. The actor, who has repeatedly used his public prominence to decry the impact of climate change, is understood to have contributed at least $30m to environmental causes.\n\nAn email to the Isha Foundation also went unanswered.", "description": "Charities warn actor that Cauvery tree-planting scheme could harm endangered waterway and its environs", "authors": ["Vidhi Doshi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15614b11731b7793adfbb46ee628260fff4a688d/0_159_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aa0cd5968f805c3899e58a1b31c2880e", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
