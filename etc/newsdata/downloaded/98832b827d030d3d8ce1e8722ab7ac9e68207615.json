Brent is currently about 23% lower than its peak for this year in April.\n\n\u201cNext year the curtailment of demand growth coming from lower GDP (gross domestic product) growth expectations and continuation of the U.S.-China trade war could shave more oil demand from the market,\u201d its analysts said.\n\nData due this week on U.S. inventory levels will be delayed by a day to Wednesday and Thursday because of the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday.\n\nU.S. crude oil stockpiles likely declined for a third straight week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.\n\nOn the supply side, Venezuela\u2019s oil exports fell in August to their lowest level in 2019, internal reports and Refinitiv Eikon data showed, following tougher U.S. sanctions.", "description": "Oil prices recovered some ground on Wednesday, boosted by a wider market pickup on positive news from China's services sector, having touched their lowest in close to a month during the previous session on fears over the weakening global economy.", "authors": ["Florence Tan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426009879&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830CV-OCABS"}
