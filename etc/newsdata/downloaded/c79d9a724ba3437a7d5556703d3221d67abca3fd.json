Now what does he want?", "language": "en", "text": "BARCELONA \u2014 This week, when he\u2019s starring on the world stage as a militant monster, it\u2019s hard to recall that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who\u2019s led Turkey for the past 16 years, was not long ago lauded and credited with doing more than anyone else to democratize his country. This week, everyone from Sen. Lindsey Graham to German Chancellor Angela Merkel is condemning him and Turkey\u2019s bloody incursion into northeastern Syria, widely regarded as the beginning of a systematic ethnic cleansing of Kurds.\n\nAnd Erdogan stood his ground, initially refusing to meet with Vice President Mike Pence and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who were dispatched to Ankara to demand a cease-fire. \u201cI will not meet with them,\u201d Erdogan reportedly told Sky News. \u201cI will speak when Trump comes.\u201d Shortly afterward, his office seemed to reverse that stance and agreed to a meeting \u2014but gave no sign he would pull back his army.\n\nErdogan has long fumed that Kurds were building a de facto nation in the northeast corner of Syria, which he doesn\u2019t want to extend into his own country, whose population is around 18 percent Kurdish. Beyond creating a secure border zone for Turkey, Erdogan explains one of the goals of his Operation Peace Spring is to relocate a third or more of the 3.6 million refugees that Turkey has taken in since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011 \u2014 for which, incidentally, it has been reimbursed billions of dollars by the European Union.\n\n\u201cNationalist,\u201d \u201cauthoritarian,\u201d \u201cIslamist\u201d \u2014 Erdogan in recent years has been called all of these things, not without justification. But he is also a canny politician who by all signs took the measure of President Trump in a one-on-one phone call last week, persuading the American president to pull back the U.S. force stationed along the Syria-Turkey border. That opened the door to Turkey\u2019s invasion, and economic and political retaliation by a White House that apparently hadn\u2019t thought through the consequences of Trump\u2019s casual acquiescence. Whether Erdogan has overreached this time will have enormous consequences not just for his country, but for the entire Mideast \u2014 not to mention Europe and the rest of the Western world.\n\n\u201cDoes he believe he can actually do it?\u201d Hannah Lucinda Smith, author of \u201cErdogan Rising,\u201d speculated to Yahoo News about Erdogan\u2019s ambitious plan to resettle a million Syrian refugees back across the border into the area from which the Kurds are now fleeing. She suspects the plan is for domestic consumption, meant to solidify Erdogan\u2019s image as \u201cthe one protecting Turkey from nefarious powers.\u201d It\u2019s an idea that is proving popular with Turks, who are getting tired of housing the refugees and have been struggling economically.\n\nMeanwhile, Erdogan managed in just a week to alienate the Trump administration, which sent Pence to Ankara on Wednesday to tell the Turkish president to \u201cstand down, end the violence and come to the negotiating table.\u201d Even Trump himself is now castigating the leader he is scheduled to meet Nov. 13. On Monday, Trump called for a ceasefire, announced he was suspending negotiations on a $100 billion trade deal with Turkey, promised personal sanctions on Turkish officials and a draconian tariff of 50 percent on Turkish steel. \u201cI am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path,\u201d the president said, while washing his hands of a matter he seemed to regard as someone else\u2019s problem. Anybody who\u2019s interested in stepping up to help protect the Kurds, he tweeted \u201cis good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d", "description": "In one phone call, Turkey\u2019s president Erdogan talked Donald Trump into pulling U.S. troops from the Syrian border \u2014 allowing him to begin an invasion that is turning into a humanitarian disaster, and provoking retaliation by a furiously back-pedaling White House. Who is Erdogan \u2014 and how does he do it", "authors": ["Melissa Rossi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ICe9FNO6CPXc8EOJsh29NA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/6d011f70-ef90-11e9-bbff-eef65f884806", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
