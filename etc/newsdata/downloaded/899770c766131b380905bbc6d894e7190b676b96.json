MORE\u2019s controversial decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria, Republican sources told The Hill.\n\nKinzinger has been extremely critical of Trump\u2019s actions in Syria in both tweets and media appearances. But GOP lawmakers in Tuesday evening\u2019s meeting say they sat up in their seats when Kinzinger, an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran, went to the microphone and voiced frustration and anger to Esper over the Syria issue.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cKinzinger let Esper know exactly how he felt about the Syria decision and the damaging, deadly repercussions it will have,\u201d said a Republican source familiar with the exchange, which occurred at the weekly GOP whip meeting hosted by Majority Whip Steve Scalise Stephen (Steve) Joseph ScaliseFurious Republicans prepare to rebuke Trump on Syria Five ways Trump's Syria decision spells trouble Cheney slated to introduce bill to place sanctions on Turkey MORE (R-La.).\n\nNeither Kinzinger\u2019s office nor the Pentagon had any comment. Republicans described the meeting to CNN as \u201ca little heated,\u201d with one lawmaker calling Trump\u2019s Syria move \u201cthe worst foreign policy decision of my lifetime.\"\n\nKinzinger has been one of the most vocal GOP critics of Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria \u2014 a move which has allowed Turkey to launch deadly military strikes against Kurdish forces that had assisted the U.S.-led fight against ISIS.\n\n\u201c@realDonaldTrump I thought you were going to defeat ISIS, that is why people voted for you. What changed? This is weakness. America is far more honorable than this,\u201d Kinzinger tweeted at Trump after he announced his Syria decision.\n\n\u201cHow is reconstituting ISIS, abandoning the Kurds, and green lighting a slaughter by the Turks not our concern?\u201d Kinzinger tweeted earlier Wednesday.\n\nThe meeting with Esper came a day before the House overwhelmingly voted 354 to 60 to pass a resolution rebuking Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops out of Syria and condemning Turkey\u2019s attacks on the Kurds.\n\nScalise had invited Esper to speak at the whip meeting weeks ago, before Trump\u2019s set his new policy in Syria. But because of urgency of the issue, the Syria withdrawal and Turkey aggression quickly became the focus of the private gathering in the basement of the Capitol.\n\nEarlier this year, Kinzinger, a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard, had pitched himself to become Trump\u2019s secretary of the Air Force. But Trump nominated Barbara Barrett, a businesswoman and former diplomat, instead. The Senate confirmed her nomination Wednesday in an 85-7 vote.\n\nRebecca Kheel contributed.", "description": "Rep.
