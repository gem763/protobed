That game is currently scheduled for a 4:08 first pitch.\n\nAccuWeather gives a 68% chance of precipitation in the District on Wednesday with rain totaling 1.16 inches, according to a Tuesday morning forecast. It\u2019s worse in New York, where Wednesday night \u2014 when the Yankees and Houston Astros are scheduled to play Game 4 of the ALCS in the Bronx \u2014 there is an 85% chance of precipitation.\n\nA rainout in New York would mean the Yankees and Astros would shift their Games 4 and 5 to Thursday and Friday, with a short travel turnaround to play a potential Game 6 in Houston on Saturday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
