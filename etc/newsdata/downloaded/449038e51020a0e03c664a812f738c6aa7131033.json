(AP) - Joe Burrow threw for 327 yards and four touchdowns to break the LSU season record with 29 in the No. 2 Tigers\u2019 36-13 victory over Mississippi State on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a testament to him, the receivers, the offensive line, the coaches,\u201d LSU coach Ed Orgeron said. \u201cBut we\u2019re just getting started. Our team is not satisfied.\u201d\n\nLSU (7-0, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) had 415 yards of total offense and averaged 6.9 yards per play. The Tigers forced three turnovers, including a momentum-shifting interception right before half.\n\nMississippi State (3-4, 1-3) sacked Burrows three times and regularly confounded the Tigers on third down. LSU struggled early in finding its rhythm on offense and was forced to settle for field goals on its first three drives.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play our best game today, but I knew this day was going to come, and I\u2019m proud of our defense,\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cYour offense is not going to play great, on fire every week.\u201d\n\nStill, the Tigers managed to score points on every drive of the first half and led 22-7 at the break. A pair of third-quarter touchdowns sealed the win.\n\n\u201cWe just started off slow,\u201d Burrows said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t execute, and I didn\u2019t feel as much energy before the game. Early this morning you could tell that people weren\u2019t quite as locked in as they had been. But it\u2019s still good to get an SEC win.\u201d\n\nBurrows was 25 of 32 and again threw prolifically to Justin Jefferson and Ja\u2019Marr Chase. Jefferson had eight catches for 89 yards and a touchdown. Chase had five catches for 48 yards and a touchdown. Racey McMath and Derrick Dillon also caught TD passes.\n\n\u201cIt just shows the amount of work we put in over the off season,\u201d Burrows said.\n\nMississippi State freshman Garrett Shrader threw for 238 yards and a touchdown with two interceptions. He also rushed for 66 yards and another touchdown. Kylin Hill, the SEC\u2019s No. 2 rusher, had only 34 yards and was held below 100 yards for the third straight game. Mississippi State had 13 penalties for 109 yards.\n\n\u201cWhen the margin for error is invisible, you can\u2019t turn the ball over three times against a team this good and expect to win,\u201d Bulldogs coach Joe Moorhead said. \u201cAnd certainly those 13 penalties, some of that pre-snap stuff, it may not be on the front of it, but it\u2019s going to help get you beat against a team like this.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nLSU: Even in a hostile conference road environment, the Tigers kept right on doing the same things they\u2019ve done all season: scoring points and shutting down opposing offenses. This team has all the pieces to compete in Atlanta and beyond.\n\nMSU: The Bulldogs looked as good on defense as they have at any point this season, but the math for bowl eligibility continues to get tougher for second-year head coach Joe Moorhead.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLSU: Hosts No. 11 Auburn.\n\nMississippi State: At Texas A&M.;\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Joe Burrow threw for 327 yards and four touchdowns to break the LSU season record with 29 in the No. 2 Tigers' 36-13 victory over Mississippi State on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "R.J.
