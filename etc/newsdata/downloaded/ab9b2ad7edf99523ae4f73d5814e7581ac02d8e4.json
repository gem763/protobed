It is a Tier 1 partner for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner program.\n\nSir Michael said Fishermans Bend was the only Boeing location in the world to apply the unique resin-infusion system that enables the components to be cured without a traditional autoclave.\n\n\u201cWhen building that plant we put in a whole bunch of research scientists cheek by jowl with the engineers so there is a synergy between the new research and the production,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Brisbane, Boeing is building a prototype of an unmanned aircraft designed to fly in groups alongside manned fighter jets. It is called the Boeing Airpower Teaming System and was first revealed at the Avalon air show in February.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very exciting new venture for us which was designed and conceived in Australia in partnership with the Australian Defence Forces,\u201d Sir Michael said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to see if we can\u2019t use it from here as an export to other countries.\u201d\n\nTwin tragedies\n\nIt has been a tough 12 months for Boeing because of the fallout from the accidents involving two separate 737 MAX aircraft operated by Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines.\n\n\u201cWe have just been totally focused on how we can get out from that problem because safety is paramount and it has been for 100 years,\u201d he said. \"We are sharpening our focus and realigning internal resources to really strengthen the culture of safety that we have.\"\n\nBoeing chairman and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg and the Boeing board of directors commissioned a five-month independent review of the company\u2019s policies and processes for aircraft design and development.\n\nIn response to the review, Sir Michael said Boeing had tightened its oversight of engineers by creating a new product and services safety organisation which reports directly to the chief engineer who, in turn, reports to Mr Muilenburg.", "description": "Boeing, the $200 billion aircraft maker, is using advanced manufacturing techniques at its plants in Melbourne and Brisbane to boost exports of products for the civil aviation market and possibly for military customers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2981%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_680/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f59ab28d528f231479646f36c9dec4837912ac8c", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
