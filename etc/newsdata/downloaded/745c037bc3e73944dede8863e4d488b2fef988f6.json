Parliament is expected to dissolve next week to make way for the campaign.\n\nCurrent polls (FT poll tracker):\n\nConservatives (35%), Labour (25%), Liberal Democrats (18%), Brexit Party (11%).\n\nRegional parties in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have less support nationally but are also expected to win seats.\n\nWhat to expect: Johnson will run as the man who'll make Brexit happen, aiming to win over pro-Brexit voters in the North of England who have historically backed Labour.\n\nHe needs to win seats in the Labour heartland to make up for losses in Scotland and greater London, where Brexit is unpopular.\n\nThe insurgent Brexit Party could take votes from both parties \u2014 Conservative voters who endorse a more hardline vision of Brexit, and Labour voters who want Brexit but don't want to vote Conservative.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, have gained support (mostly at Labour's expense) on the back of their plan to block Brexit altogether.\n\nBehind the scenes: Internal polling and focus groups have Downing Street feeling confident, a source briefed on the matter told Axios.\n\nBut the Conservatives were also flying high ahead of a snap general election in 2017 that ultimately proved disastrous for then-Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\nCorbyn exceeded expectations in that election and has survived longer as opposition leader than most anticipated. Despite record-low approval ratings, he now has an opportunity to become prime minister.\n\nIf Labour loses, the party could soon be searching for a new leader and a new political identity.\n\nThe bottom line: Conventional wisdom in Westminster is that Johnson is likely to win, though perhaps not with the big majority some Conservatives are hoping for. But the U.K.'s recent political history suggests we should be prepared for the unexpected.", "description": "Boris hasn't gotten Brexit, but he is getting an election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/PJ6xhItyCEayHJVDyYrahSs2VjU=/0x173:4442x2672/1920x1080/2019/10/29/1572383274395.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
