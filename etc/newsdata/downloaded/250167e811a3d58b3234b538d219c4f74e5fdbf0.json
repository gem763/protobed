In Washington this week, Hillary Clinton summed up her bid for the White House in 2016.\n\n\u201cYou can run the best campaign. You can have the best plans. You can get the nomination. You can win the popular vote. And you can lose the electoral college and therefore the election.\u201d\n\nClinton beat Donald Trump in the popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots yet lost the electoral college \u2013 the body of people who represent states and actually get to choose the president \u2013 by 304 votes to 227. A black swan event never to be repeated? No. In 2020, it could easily happen again.\n\nA study from the University of Texas at Austin found that the electoral college is much more likely than previously thought to elect the candidate who loses the popular vote. In close elections, researchers argues, such \u201cinversions\u201d are normal, not exceptional.\n\nIn a race decided by less than 2% (2.6m votes), the study found, the probability of an inversion is 32%. In a race decided by less than 1% (1.3m votes), the probability is 45%.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost a coin flip,\u201d said Michael Geruso, an assistant economics professor.\n\nSome critics of Trump have never quite accepted him as the legitimate president, pointing out that he does not represent the will of the majority. After his uniquely divisive first term, a repeat could trigger a furious backlash.\n\nThe Republicans do a really determined job of winning power with fewer voters Senator Sheldon Whitehouse\n\nIn 48 presidential elections since 1824 there have been four inversions: in 1876, 1888, 2000 and 2016. All four favoured Republicans, although the researchers argue there have been periods when it was more likely a Democrat would win by inversion.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to understand, were these statistically likely events or were they flukes?\u201d Geruso said. \u201cAnd in some sense it was just shocking to us that no one had asked and answered that question yet.\u201d\n\nGeruso and his colleagues found that all the most common election models used by political scientists led to a very similar result for the probability of inversion.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of questions where different models would give different answers but, on the question of how likely is an electoral inversion in a close race, we don\u2019t need to agree or decide on what the perfect model of elections is. They all give the same answer.\u201d\n\nClinton ran up huge margins in states such as California, Illinois and New York. Agonisingly, her loss of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by a combined 77,000 votes cost her the electoral college.\n\nSome analysts doubt Trump could get so lucky again. But Geruso said he has a decent chance of catching lightning in a bottle once more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really easy to look at the 2016 election and for people to feel like that was an extraordinary election, an extraordinary political moment, it was unusual in a lot of ways. And that may all be true but it turns out that\u2019s not why the 2016 election ended in a mismatch between the electoral college and national popular vote. It ended in an inversion because that election was close and close elections, we show, just have a relatively high probability of ending in an inversion.\u201d\n\nIt is less about Trump\u2019s appeal to certain constituencies than simple geography and maths.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be tempted into thinking that the reason that 2020 might be an inversion is because Donald Trump is running in that race. Inversions are going to keep happening in close races for as long as we have the electoral college because they have been happening.\u201d\n\nAccording to Geruso, two major reasons are often cited for inversions. When Clinton won New York and California she did so by big margins, but when she lost states such as Florida or Ohio she did so narrowly. Thus there was an imbalance in the aggregate vote tallies.\n\nSecondly, since a state\u2019s number of electoral college votes is determined by how many senators and representatives it has, and every state has two senators, small states have greater representation in the college relative to population size. Each senator in California represents nearly 20 million people. Each senator in Wyoming represents 290,000. The current alignment favours Republicans, although there are exceptions such as the District of Columbia.\n\nThe researchers found a 77% probability that, if an inversion occurs, it will be a Democratic popular vote majority and a Republican electoral college win.\n\n\u2018Second-grade soccer\u2019\n\nSeveral Democratic candidates for president, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, have called for the college to be abolished. The party, however, is wrestling with how to exploit it as ruthlessly as Republicans do.\n\nSenator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, appearing on Real Time with Bill Maher, said: \u201cThe Republicans do a really determined job of winning power with fewer voters and we don\u2019t take on that infrastructure and we don\u2019t take on that strategy. We\u2019re too happy fighting the fight of the minute. It\u2019s second-grade soccer, chasing the ball, and they are planning ahead.\u201d\n\nThe electoral college actually undermines democracy LaTosha Brown\n\nSome observers fear the electoral college encourages voter suppression. Republican efforts to use voter ID laws to limit registration in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin will be closely scrutinised.\n\nStanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster and strategist and author of new book RIP GOP, said: \u201cIf there is a close national election, Republicans will resort to things they have done demonstrably well over the last decade of trying to suppress the vote.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the Wisconsin case in 2016 was produced not by low turnout among African Americans but pushing them off the voter rolls with new voter ID laws, and so there was a sharp drop in eligible voters and people were prevented legally from voting. So obviously the most important thing is to make sure we did not have a close election.\u201d\n\nWhile southern states such as Mississippi, Louisiana and Georgia have the highest proportions of African Americans in the country, those who vote for the Democrat are effectively ignored by the electoral college.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hillary Clinton delivers her concession speech, in the New Yorker hotel. Photograph: REX/Shutterstock\n\nLaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said: \u201cThey never have any influence on picking the president because of winner takes all. It gives the impression everyone in the south is conservative.\n\n\u201cIn these states it\u2019s based on a systemic history of racism. What I\u2019m seeing is people of colour don\u2019t fundamentally believe they\u2019re living in a democracy. Why don\u2019t you have proportional representation? What possible justification is there for winner takes all? The electoral college actually undermines democracy.\u201d\n\nFew expect Trump to win the popular vote. But in a chilling warning for Democrats, the New York Times suggested he could win the electoral college again, because mostly white working class rust belt states remain at the centre of the electoral map.\n\n\u201cA strategy rooted in racial polarization could at once energize parts of the president\u2019s base and rebuild support among wavering white working-class voters,\u201d Nate Cohn wrote. \u201cMany of these voters backed Mr Trump in the first place in part because of his views on hot-button issues, including on immigration and race.\u201d\n\nBill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution think tank at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, noted that George W Bush lost the popular vote in 2000 but won it in 2004 after improving in Texas and post-9/11 New York.\n\nFor Trump, he said, \u201cit\u2019s a tight squeeze. There\u2019s not much margin for error. But he could do it again, like he did in 2016, without the popular vote.\n\n\u201cSo expect Trump derangement syndrome to get even worse.\u201d", "description": "Hillary Clinton won a majority but lost the presidency in the electoral college.
