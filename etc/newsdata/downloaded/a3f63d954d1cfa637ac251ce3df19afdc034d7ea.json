There's no reason a single family should pay more when every single corporation pays less. How can Republicans defend this?\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York.\n\n\"Kill the bill\"\n\nOpinion polls show Americans are divided on the bill, which slashes the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, from 35 percent right now. Republicans say that will boost growth, create jobs and raise wages.\n\nIt also exempts companies from paying US taxes on most of their profits made abroad, granting multinationals a request they'd been making for years.\n\nAfter midnight in Washington, D.C., the Senate narrowly passed the legislation on a party-line 51-48 vote.\n\nProtesters interrupted with chants of \"kill the bill, don't kill us\" and Vice President Mike Pence repeatedly called for order.\n\n'America ready to take off'\n\nUpon passage, Republicans cheered and called it a historic day.\n\n\"After eight straight years of slow growth and underperformance, America is ready to take off,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n\"Coupled with the regulatory reforms that have already been implemented by the administration, we now add comprehensive tax reform, major middle-class tax relief, and making our businesses both large and small more competitive around the world.\"\n\nPresident Trump called the tax break the \"biggest in history\" and rejoiced that the bill also scraps a key aspect of Obamacare by ending a fine on Americans who don't get health insurance.\n\nHe said if the bill was approved on Wednesday, he would hold a news conference at the White House later in the day.", "description": "The most sweeping US tax reform in decades clears its biggest hurdle.
