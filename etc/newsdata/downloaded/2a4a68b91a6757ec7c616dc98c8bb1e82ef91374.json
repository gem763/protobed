(AP) - Matt Olson had never hit a ball to the second level of elevated bleachers, even in batting practice.\n\nHe sure found a timely moment to accomplish the feat, hitting a tying homer leading off the seventh before Seth Brown hit a go-ahead double two batters later, leading the Oakland Athletics past the Kansas City Royals 2-1 on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cThat was one of my better swings,\u201d Olson said with a smile, offering little more explanation except that the ball doesn\u2019t usually carry like that at night.\n\nOlson\u2019s drive to center reached the Coliseum seats above the luxury suites - a spot only a handful of sluggers have visited. Jorge Lopez (4-8) then hit Mark Canha with a pitch before Brown doubled.\n\n\u201cThe home run that Oley hit inspired everybody,\u201d manager Bob Melvin said.\n\nA.J. Puk (2-0) followed Brett Anderson and struck out two over two shutout innings for his second major league win. Liam Hendriks struck out two in a 1-2-3 ninth for his 23rd save in 29 opportunities.\n\nHendriks\u2019 116 strikeouts as a reliever this season passed Hall of Famer Rollie Fingers - 115 in 1975 - for most in franchise history.\n\nThe A\u2019s, who hold the top AL wild-card spot, bounced back after their six-game winning streak was snapped by Monday\u2019s 6-5 loss to the Royals in the series opener.\n\nKansas City\u2019s Nick Dini hit a sacrifice fly in the fifth for the game\u2019s first run.\n\nAnderson allowed five hits over five innings and would have liked to go longer, but Melvin is trying to get some younger pitchers like Puk and Jesus Luzardo key experience down the stretch. The left-hander has received three or fewer runs of support in 16 of his last 22 starts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t want to go longer but having a couple lefties throwing upper-90s after you is never a bad option,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nLopez - who has only won on the road this season - missed a chance at winning three straight starts for the first time in his career. Demoted to the bullpen for an extensive stretch midseason, he has been steady of late.\n\nThe right-hander allowed two runs and four hits in six innings in his first career start against the A\u2019s and second appearance.\n\n\u201cThe last three, four starts I\u2019ve been doing the same, trusting my sinker and have that power curveball after those sinkers,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cThat\u2019s a team that will challenge you. You just have to stay down in the zone and try to make them uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nRyan McBroom doubled leading off the fifth and advanced on a single by Cheslor Cuthbert before Dini\u2019s sac fly for Kansas City, which took pregame infield practice - a rare sight for September.\n\nMajors hits leader Whit Merrifield, coming off three consecutive two-hit games for the Royals, went 0 for 4.\n\nSEPTEMBER SURGING\n\nThe A\u2019s improved to 12-4 in September, second in baseball only to Milwaukee\u2019s 13-3. The Brewers beat San Diego at home.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nAthletics: RHP Mike Fiers underwent an MRI exam for nerve irritation in his hand, and then threw a bullpen session. He is scheduled to make his next start, likely one of this weekend\u2019s games against Texas. Fiers left his start Saturday in the second inning because of numbness. \u2026 Melvin was a late arrival after receiving another round of injections in his troublesome neck. \u2026 OF Ramon Laureano had a night off from starting after playing four of the previous five games, though he came in late. Laureano was activated from the injured list Sept. 6 after missing 32 games with a stress reaction in his lower right leg and Melvin is being careful to not overextend him.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRight-hander Homer Bailey (13-8, 4.76 ERA) pitches for the A\u2019s against his former Royals club, opposite lefty Danny Duffy (6-6, 4.55 ERA). Bailey was acquired by Oakland in a trade July 14. He was the winning pitcher in a 19-4 victory at Kansas City on Aug. 26. Duffy is 4-0 with a 2.89 ERA over eight appearances and seven starts vs. Oakland.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Matt Olson had never hit a ball to the second level of elevated bleachers, even in batting practice.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Janie Mccauley"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/royals_athletics_baseball_61042_c0-113-3208-1983_s1770x1032.jpg?e7a694176e428fd613c04b1d123b8e9cdb792894", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
