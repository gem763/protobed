(Jesse Dittmar/FTWP)\n\nMicrosoft built its fortune making the tools of technology that billions use every day.\n\nBut the company\u2019s president, Brad Smith, has increasing misgivings about how thieves, terrorists and scoundrels have weaponized those tools, and how the industry has failed too often to thwart them.\n\nHe chides Facebook for allowing influence campaigns to flourish on the network that helped elect Donald Trump president in 2016. And he argues that social media companies can\u2019t profit from hatemongers posting vile content while brushing off responsibility.\n\n\u201cDigital technology has become both a tool and a weapon, and we need to address that head on,\u201d Smith said in an interview at Microsoft headquarters here. \u201cAnd part of addressing it head on starts with really understanding the different ways in which it\u2019s either serving humanity or being weaponized.\u201d\n\nSmith lays out his critique in his forthcoming book, \u201cTools and Weapons: The Promise and The Peril of The Digital Age.\u201d Co-written with Microsoft communications executive Carol Ann Browne, the book examines the missteps tech companies have made and suggests new approaches for the industry as threats to privacy, cybercrime and disinformation mount.\n\nThe book, available Tuesday, comes during a tough summer for tech\u2019s titans. Facebook was hit with a $5 billion fine in July for repeatedly deceiving its 2.2 billion users and undermining their privacy choices. The European Union launched an antitrust investigation into whether Amazon is misusing its dual role as both a marketplace for independent sellers and a retailer of its own products. And last week, Google\u2019s YouTube agreed to pay out $170 million to settle allegations that it illegally collected data about children younger than age 13.\n\n(Amazon founder chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\n[Trustbusters are bypassing the biggest tech company of them all]\n\nBut Microsoft \u2014 the only tech company still valued over $1 trillion \u2014 has recently managed to dodge hefty fines and nasty rhetoric from lawmakers and regulators in the United States. It\u2019s in stark contrast from two decades ago, when Microsoft was tech\u2019s biggest bully and the subject of onerous litigation brought by the U.S. trustbusters and investigations by competition czars around the world.\n\nSmith acknowledges being part of the problem back then.\n\n\u201cWe made more than our share of mistakes in the antitrust era, and I was personally responsible for almost all of them, to some degree,\u201d he said in the interview.\n\nSince then, he said, Microsoft has matured and internalized lessons that younger tech companies may still need to learn.\n\nMicrosoft \u201cwas knocked off its perch in part because it had not figured out how to come to terms with the responsibilities it then had,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a story of a company that, then, ultimately learned from it and was able to internalize the need for those changes and succeed anew, but with more \u00adself-restraint than it would have ever exercised in the 1990s.\u201d\n\nIn this new era of tech skepticism, Smith and his boss, chief executive Satya Nadella, have attempted to position Microsoft as a defender of its customers\u2019 privacy and an advocate for government regulation of facial-recognition technology.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft has become the model of responsibility among the tech giants,\u201d said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management and co-author of \u201cThe Business of Platforms: Strategy in the Age of Digital Competition, Innovation, and Power.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very different than what Microsoft was.\u201d\n\nEven so, Smith admits to recent missteps. Online news site Motherboard reported last month that Microsoft contractors have listened to personal conversations of Skype users conducted through the app\u2019s translation service. Microsoft has said that it may use conversations to improve its service, but it did not make clear that people might eavesdrop to do so.\n\nWhile the issue was \u201cmore nuanced\u201d than it was portrayed, \u201cwe all make mistakes,\u201d Smith admitted.\n\nIn his book, Smith takes Facebook to task. Russia weaponized the social network\u2019s platform, using it to spread disinformation to influence the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cFacebook had not designed its services as a platform for foreign governments to use to disrupt democracy, but neither had it put in place measures that could prevent or even recognize such activity,\u201d Smith wrote.\n\n[Russians probably targeted election systems in all 50 states, Senate panel\u2019s report says]\n\nHe wrote that the Cambridge Analytica scandal \u2014 in which Facebook\u2019s privacy systems failed to detect the harvesting of users\u2019 personal data in violation of its own policies \u2014 was \u201cthe type of issue that draws plenty of criticism but leaves the company with no real defense.\u201d\n\nFacebook spokesman John Pinette declined to comment on the book.\n\nStill, while he\u2019s critical of tech\u2019s missteps, including Microsoft\u2019s own shortcomings, Smith also takes pains to note that tech giants including Facebook are increasingly working together to fight online extremism and staunch cyberattacks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s signs of intelligent life here, and it\u2019s starting to spread,\u201d Smith said in the interview.\n\nSmith grew up in Wisconsin before earning a bachelor\u2019s degree at Princeton University and his law degree from Columbia Law School. He joined Microsoft in 1993 and is the longest-tenured member of the software giant\u2019s senior leadership group.\n\nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates and former chief executive Steve Ballmer tapped Smith to serve as the company\u2019s general counsel in 2002 \u2014 following the company\u2019s settlement with the government over abusing its Windows monopoly \u2014 with a mandate to make peace with governments and an industry it had spent much of its life alienating.\n\nSmith helped broker settlements, shelling out billions of Microsoft\u2019s dollars to such adversaries such as AOL Time Warner and Sun Microsystems. And he oversaw Microsoft\u2019s compliance with the settlement agreement that ended the federal government\u2019s antitrust litigation against it, and required the company to, among other concessions, give computer makers more freedom to include rival software on their PCs.\n\n[Justice Department announces broad antitrust review of big tech]\n\nAfter shepherding the company\u2019s detente with tech companies that harbored deep-seated \u00addistrust of Microsoft, Smith took charge of the company\u2019s public policy efforts. He\u2019s testified \u00adbefore Congress on such issues as government surveillance and \u00adimmigration. Last year, he called on Congress to regulate facial-recognition technology, arguing that the industry was unlikely to adopt standards that didn\u2019t have the force of law.\n\nAnd although Smith has worked with the Trump administration on a variety of issues, including responding to cyberattacks, he may well be the most outspoken critic among tech leaders of some of the president\u2019s policies. Just after the administration rescinded protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Smith promised that Microsoft would pay for legal defense of all 39 \u201cdreamers\u201d employed at the company.\n\nHe tried to persuade the administration to remain in the Paris climate accord and then rebuked it for backing out. And earlier this year, Smith criticized the administration for refusing to endorse principles condemning election hacking and large-scale cyberattacks that threaten to undermine democracy.\n\n\u201cWe will partner where we can and stand apart where we should,\u201d Smith said.\n\nIt\u2019s the same approach, he added, the company took with the previous administration. Microsoft sued the federal government four times during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, challenging law enforcement efforts to secretly search customer data on Microsoft\u2019s servers in the United States and abroad.\n\n\u201cSo far, we\u2019ve only sued the Trump administration once,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSmith is also known for pressing for policy changes for the broader tech industry \u2014 even those that won\u2019t have much impact on Microsoft.\n\nHe believes, for instance, a 1996 law that protects Internet companies from liability for content created by their users has outlived its utility. The protections played a huge role in the growth of social media companies, which can allow users to post everything from product reviews to political rants without those companies having to fear legal liability.\n\nBut the law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has come under attack from both sides of the aisle. Some Democrats argue it allows sites to remain indifferent to hateful content, while some Republicans claim the major social networks suppress conservative voices and should be held legally responsible for all the content they publish.\n\n\u201cSection 230 had a place and time, but that time is now over,\u201d Smith said. Microsoft owns professional social network LinkedIn.\n\nSmith\u2019s book also addresses vexing issues such as bias in artificial intelligence and gaps in cybersecurity with which tech giants including Microsoft continue to wrestle.\n\nThat willingness to acknowledge weaknesses sets Smith apart from his peers, Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) said. Other tech leaders often come to Capitol Hill believing they are \u201csmarter than everyone else,\u201d Warner said. But Smith is willing to engage with lawmakers on such issues as disinformation and public safety, even if their financial impact on Microsoft is scant.\n\n\u201cHe is willing to use his personal reputation and capital, and his company\u2019s reputation and capital outside its specific lane,\u201d Warner said.", "description": "Brad Smith critiques the tech industry for allowing thieves, terrorists and scoundrels to use technology for ill.", "authors": ["Jay Greene", "Reporter Focused On Technology Coverage In The Pacific Northwest", "September At Am", "Jay Greene Is A Reporter For The Washington Post Who Is Focused On Technology Coverage In The Pacific Northwest."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ldGy_KDlBjKmuPN1DO95i-_nNsA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EFONTWGKOQI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
