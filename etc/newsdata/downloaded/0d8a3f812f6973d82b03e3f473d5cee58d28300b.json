Bowing to Republican criticism, the president abandoned his push to host next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit of industrialized nations at his Trump National Doral Miami resort. But he kept talking up his private club Monday and slammed the constitutional clause that forbids presidents from profiting from the office.\n\n\u201cGeorge Washington, they say, had two desks. He had a presidential desk and a business desk,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou people with this phony emoluments clause.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump continues to spearhead his own impeachment defense, which lacks a coherent theme or a streamlined messaging campaign. In the wake of a widely panned news conference last week \u2014 in which acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney admitted that Trump had held up aid to Ukraine in part to force the government there to investigate Democrats \u2014 a growing number of the president\u2019s allies are pushing for sweeping changes in the West Wing.\n\nSome major Republican donors have made it clear to party leaders and White House officials that they are unhappy with what they see as uncertainty and mixed messages. They have been informally floating suggestions for potential Mulvaney replacements, according to a White House official and two GOP lawmakers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe private discussions.\n\n\u201cThere are big donors who want an establishment guy in there now,\u201d the White House official said, but added that this dynamic \u201chappens every time there are problems, and there is no reason to believe the president is even listening.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump told some officials last week that he was not troubled by Mulvaney\u2019s briefing room performance and that he was happy to have someone defending him on television. Mulvaney\u2019s hands-off approach to the president, which irks some GOP advisers, is one of the things that Trump values in his acting chief, according to current and former administration officials.\n\nStill, the president has bristled at negative media coverage since Mulvaney\u2019s news conference and has sought to reshape the narrative on his own. On Monday, Trump followed his hour-long televised Cabinet remarks with a taped interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity.\n\nTrump\u2019s reluctance to assemble a war room inside the West Wing is shaped in part by his confidence in his ability to defend himself, according to advisers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe president has told several friends in recent days that he believes Democrats are divided and somewhat scattered about how to proceed in their impeachment inquiry, according to people who have spoken with him.\n\nHe has said he believes that House Democrats might fumble their probe and eventually decide against bringing articles of impeachment to a floor vote, according to two Trump advisers briefed on his discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly. But most of his friends have gently cautioned against that optimism and said Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is determined to move forward, the advisers said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d rather send out late-night tweets and TV clips that he wants in the echo chamber than have some kind of war room,\u201d said former Trump campaign adviser Sam Nunberg. \u201cWhat you\u2019re looking at is a TV president having 24-7 TV, new media and social media responses who doesn\u2019t see the point of a war room. That\u2019s his style, and that\u2019s his strategy right now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany Republicans, however, have told officials in the White House and allies in Trump\u2019s orbit that they cannot mount effective arguments in defense of the president, whose brash approach often leaves them in the dark. On Monday, Trump sought to defend himself from emoluments clause charges by making baseless accusations against his predecessors, accusing Obama and Washington of using their office to conduct private business deals.\n\n\u201cIn this situation, when only the president and his personal attorney seem to have all the facts, it\u2019s hard to have a coordinated defense,\u201d said Michael Steel, a former top aide to House GOP leaders. \u201cWithout sharing the same ammunition and the same facts, you\u2019re not going to be able be effective, even if you gather people on laptops in a room.\u201d\n\nFor their part, Democrats have moved forward with the impeachment inquiry, which they have cast as a somber probe into how Trump has abused his office for personal and political gain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPelosi distributed a \u201cfact sheet\u201d Monday describing Trump\u2019s push for a Ukrainian investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter as a gross abuse of presidential power.\n\nThe document included three categories of misconduct: \u201cthe shakedown,\u201d \u201cthe pressure campaign\u201d and \u201cthe cover up.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats are scheduled to depose Bill Taylor, the top official at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine. In text messages with two other American diplomats, Taylor raised alarms about the White House holding back military aid to Ukraine while Trump pushed for political investigations. At one point, he said it was \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign\u201d and a \u201cnightmare scenario.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the wake of damning testimony from officials in his own administration, Trump has lamented that his party isn\u2019t doing enough to defend him from what he called a \u201cvicious\u201d impeachment process led by Democrats.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRepublicans have to get tougher and fight,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cWe have some that are great fighters, but they have to get tougher and fight because the Democrats are trying to hurt the Republican Party for the election.\u201d\n\nAs the White House has resisted calls to build a political operation to counter the Democrats on impeachment, some outside Trump allies, including former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, have mulled starting their own initiatives to boost the president.\n\nAD\n\nBannon, who has had a strained and turbulent relationship with Trump ever since he was ousted from the West Wing in 2017, had talks over the weekend with associates about launching a podcast that he hopes would serve as an outside war room of sorts for the embattled president, according to three people familiar with his plans.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is not enough focus, and there\u2019s no communication between the White House and the Hill or with the grass roots,\u201d Bannon said Monday night in a brief phone call. \u201cThis is a public media play that will have an everyday focus to help people understand what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski is one of the people Bannon has contacted in recent days about being a guest on the podcast. Both Lewandowski and former Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie have long been discussed by Trump aides as possible hires for a White House defense effort, and Lewandowski, in particular, remains a Trump confidant.\n\nLewandowski confirmed Monday that he had spoken with Bannon about the possible podcast and said, \u201cProactive communication is necessary to inform the American people about what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nThe White House\u2019s willingness to listen could be quite limited: Bannon remains intensely disliked by many top Trump advisers who do not trust him and object to his hard-line nationalism.\n\nRegardless of outside efforts, the clamor for a more efficient and united impeachment front is expected to carry on this week, as some Trump loyalists float names for a new chief of staff and the president and top aides consider their next steps.\n\nTrump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner has received calls from presidential allies frustrated with Mulvaney, who remains in an \u201cacting\u201d position 10 months after taking the job, according to people familiar with the matter. But Kushner is not actively leading a search for a new chief of staff, according to someone close to him, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nWhite House press aides said Friday that Mulvaney\u2019s standing in the White House was unchanged in the wake of his news conference, which prompted a statement from Mulvaney hours later attempting to retract what he had said about a quid pro quo on Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Mulvaney acknowledged that his appearance had been less than \u201cperfect\u201d but said he had not considered resigning.\n\n\u201cI still think I\u2019m doing a pretty good job as the chief of staff, and I think the president agrees,\u201d he said.", "description": "Trump\u2019s bombastic behavior is causing growing alarm among GOP lawmakers, donors and advisers who have called for a\u00a0more disciplined strategy.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter", "Robert Costa", "National Political Reporter Covering The White House", "Congress"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9UlLN4EUcVpzeR_wswW2-ZR8SAU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7KQ2UHHUEEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
