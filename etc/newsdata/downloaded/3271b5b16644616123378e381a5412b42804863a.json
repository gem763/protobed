(New England Journal of Medicine /New England Journal of Medicine)\n\nWhen the 25-year-old woman arrived at the emergency room, she was weak, dizzy and experiencing shortness of breath. But her doctors immediately zeroed in on a much more concerning symptom.\n\n\u201cShe looked physically blue,\u201d Otis Warren, an emergency medicine physician who treated the woman last year in Rhode Island, told The Washington Post.\n\nThe woman\u2019s skin and nails had taken on a bluish tint \u2014 a common sign that the body isn\u2019t getting enough oxygen \u2014 and her blood had also turned unusually dark, according to a report published in Thursday\u2019s issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nLuckily, doctors knew exactly what was wrong.\n\nThe concerning symptoms pointed to a rare and potentially fatal condition called acquired methemoglobinemia, in which exposure to certain chemicals or medicines changes the shape of a person\u2019s hemoglobin molecules, causing their blood to stop releasing oxygen into the surrounding tissue, Warren said. As a result, tissues become blue and the blood that is now \u201cselfishly holding onto the oxygen\u201d darkens from a \u201cbright brilliant red color\u201d to a \u201cchocolaty brown,\u201d he said. Methemoglobinemia can also be passed down through families, though that form is much rarer.\n\nIn this instance, doctors say the woman\u2019s condition was triggered by a reaction to a topical pain medication she used to soothe a toothache. The medicine contained benzocaine, the active ingredient in a number of over-the-counter anesthetic ointments. Benzocaine is also often used by doctors and nurses to numb patients\u2019 noses and throats during procedures. There have been more than 400 reported cases of benzocaine-associated methemoglobinemia since 1971, according to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe morning after applying the medicine, the woman, who was not named in the report, told doctors she woke up feeling short of breath, Warren said.\n\nThen, she saw herself in the mirror, became \u201cvery concerned\u201d and rushed to the hospital, he said.\n\n\u201c\u2018I am blue,\u2019\u201d the woman informed medical staff upon arrival, according to Warren. Her blood samples also showed the telltale discoloration, he said. Warren emphasized that the woman\u2019s blood was brown, not dark blue as other media outlets have reported.\n\nThroughout his career, Warren has seen only one other patient with the disorder, but still vividly recalls the signs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing that sticks with you,\u201d he said.\n\nOnce doctors learned about the benzocaine, they quickly connected the dots and administered the aptly named antidote, methylene blue, Warren said. Methylene blue returns the altered hemoglobin to its normal form, restoring the blood\u2019s ability to deliver oxygen.\n\n\n\nBlood samples from a 25-year-old woman diagnosed with acquired methemoglobinemia. (New England Journal of Medicine)\n\nLab results later confirmed the diagnosis, revealing that 44 percent of the hemoglobin in the woman\u2019s body had been affected, according to the case report. Patients with levels of more than 50 percent can be at risk for heart failure, coma or even death, Warren said.\n\n\u201cShe was on that precipice, for sure,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a 2018 announcement about the danger of benzocaine products and methemoglobinemia, the FDA noted that it identified 119 reports of the condition within the past decade, most of which were serious and required treatment. Of those cases, four people, including one infant, died. The federal agency warned that any oral drugs containing benzocaine should not be used to treat infants and children younger than 2 years old, a demographic that is particularly susceptible to the blood disorder, Warren said.\n\n\u201cThese products carry serious risks and provide little to no benefits for treating oral pain, including sore gums in infants due to teething,\u201d the FDA wrote.\n\nIt is unclear how much benzocaine the woman used, but Warren said even small amounts can be dangerous depending on the person.\n\n\u201cThis is a medicine that is commonly used with no problem all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s certain people out there who have this idiosyncratic reaction, and you won\u2019t know it until it happens.\u201d\n\nThe woman received two doses of methylene blue administered through an IV and responded well to the treatment, Warren said. She spent one night in the hospital before her symptoms cleared up and she was discharged with a referral to the dentist.\n\nWarren said he and another doctor decided to publish the details of the woman\u2019s experience on Thursday given its rarity, adding that it was a \u201cvery interesting physiological case.\u201d\n\n\u201cI might work another 20 years and may never see anything like this again,\u201d he said.", "description": "A 25-year-old woman in Rhode Island was diagnosed with a rare and potentially fatal condition called acquired methemoglobinemia, which causes a person's blood to stop releasing oxygen into their surrounding tissues, turning them blue.", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team", "September At Am", "Allyson Chiu Is A Reporter With The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
