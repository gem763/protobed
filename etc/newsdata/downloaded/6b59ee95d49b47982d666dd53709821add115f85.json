Some candidates support such programs to address gun violence in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThere are two problems I have with mandatory buybacks,\u201d Castro said. \u201cNumber one, folks can\u2019t define it, and if you\u2019re not going door-to-door then it\u2019s not really mandatory. But also, in the places that I grew up in, we weren\u2019t exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door.\u201d\n\nThe former mayor of San Antonio said it was not uncommon to hear gunshots in his neighborhood while growing up in the city.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro: \"I am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door-to-door in certain communities because police violence is also gun violence and we need to address that\" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/Afix0ApDcJ \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 16, 2019\n\nCastro was the first candidate to bring up Atatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old Black woman who was fatally shot over the weekend by Aaron Dean, a white police officer. Jefferson was playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew in her Fort Worth, Texas, home when officers arrived at the property for a welfare check. A neighbor had called a nonemergency police number after noticing the house\u2019s doors were open.\n\nDean did not knock on Jefferson\u2019s door or identify himself before shooting his gun. He resigned before the police department could fire him. He was arrested Monday on murder charges, and was released that night after posting bond. Police investigations into Dean are ongoing, and Jefferson\u2019s family has called for a third-party investigation.\n\n\u201cI am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door-to-door in certain communities,\u201d Castro said Tuesday. \u201cBecause police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that.\u201d\n\nCastro is one of the only candidates whose plans to address gun violence also include addressing police brutality, and he has said previously that the country\u2019s policing system is more than just \u201ca few bad apples.\u201d His \u201cPeople First\u201d policing plan released earlier this summer lays out proposals to end hyperaggressive policing, hold officers accountable for their actions against communities and bridge the divide between law enforcement and communities of color.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nDemocratic Candidates Turn Fire On New Front-Runner Elizabeth Warren\n\nAnother Democratic Debate, Another Pointless Argument About Health Care\n\n4 Debates In, Democrats Finally Got The Chance To Talk Abortion Rights\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
