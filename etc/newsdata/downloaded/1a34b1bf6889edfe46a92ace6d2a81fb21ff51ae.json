She left for school early in the morning but never showed up. Her parents became anxious soon after and sounded the alarm around at midday, prompting a massive search effort.\n\nAs Saratov police officers looked for a suspect and swept the area using sniffer dogs, hundreds of volunteers and concerned citizens teamed up to question locals and try to find any clues about the apparent crime. Leaflets bearing the child\u2019s image were distributed and messages asking for help were sent out.\n\nThe search party had a line of shabby, semi-abandoned garages lying along the road leading to the girl\u2019s school in their sights.\n\nBut hopes of finding the missing child alive faded by Thursday evening. Her body was finally found at a parking garage, just 70 meters away from where she lived. The child\u2019s clothing and pink footwear was found in a garbage bin.\n\nAt about the same time, police reported the arrest of a 35-year-old man who reportedly confessed to killing the girl and hiding her body in a crawlway leading out of his garage. The suspect, it emerged, had been well known to police, given his six counts of robbery and theft, as well as sexual abuse and rape.\n\nWhen officers \u2013 some of them heavily armed and equipped with protective gear \u2013 tried to bring the suspect into custody, hundreds of enraged locals thronged the area, easily outnumbering the police escort. The crowd blocked an SUV they thought was carrying the suspect.\n\nThe standoff escalated and people in the crowd started shouting, demanding the suspect be lynched on site. Despite assurances that the suspected murderer wasn\u2019t in the car, many demanded that officers open the doors. \u201cHand him over to us and we will go away!\u201d one man is heard yelling in a dramatic video.\n\nUsing protective shields and pepper spray, the police finally made way for the departing vehicle, but it didn\u2019t help defuse tensions. On Friday morning, a throng of Saratov residents occupied streets adjacent to the local police headquarters and demanded that the suspect be handed over.\n\nResponding to the outrage, local authorities told the public that the case will be given top priority. The Investigative Committee has dispatched a team of detectives and forensic experts to investigate.\n\nThe Investigative Committee also released a video in which the suspect apparently explains the motive for the murder. He claims girl walked past a garage that he had been squatting in for several months and asked him if it was his property; fearing that it could have belonged to her parents, he said he dragged the child inside and killed her.\n\nSome politicians said the death penalty should be brought back in response to the murder.\n\n\u201cWe need to bring back capital punishment,\u201dwrote Evgeny Primakov, an MP from the ruling United Russia party. A similar call appeared on change.org website, where a petition demanding \u201cdeath for murdering a child\u201d is gaining pace, attracting over 23,000 signatures at the time of writing.\n\n\u041b\u044e\u0434\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0442 \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u043a \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044f\u044f \u041b\u0438\u0437\u0430 \u041a\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0451\u0432\u0430.\n\n\n\n\u0412\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e Ruptly pic.twitter.com/Ds3DS4SYy0 \u2014 RT \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c (@RT_russian) October 11, 2019\n\nCritics, however, argued that death penalty failed to curb crime rate anywhere in the world. \u201cA human has no right to kill another human even through the use of judicial procedures,\u201d offered the head of Russia\u2019s Human Rights Council. He added that there is always room for miscarriage of justice which could not be averted if a suspect is sentenced to death.\n\nRussia imposed a moratorium on the death penalty back in 1997 when it joined the Council of Europe. The last death sentence was handed down a year earlier.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
