And then once phase one is put in place, well, I wish them well for phase two.\"\n\nLabor frontbencher Andrew Leigh wasn't getting too carried away by these developments. \"I think it's too early to be sure where this is headed,\" Dr Leigh told reporters in Canberra.\n\nTruce to calm markets\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS companies have welcomed the truce as a possible step toward breaking a deadlock in a 15-month-old tariff war, while economists caution there was little progress toward settling core disputes including technology that threaten global growth.\n\nWashington still is planning a December 15 tariff hike on $160 billion of smartphones and other imports. Before then, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to attend an economic conference in Chile in mid-November. That is raising hopes a face-to-face meeting might produce progress.\n\n\"Taking tariffs out of the equation for at last the next two months will give space for substantive negotiations,\" said Jake Parker, senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, an industry group.\n\nThe bruising battle over China's trade surplus and technology ambitions has disrupted global trade. Economists warn a final settlement might take years to negotiate. Despite that, financial markets rise ahead of each round of talks and fall back when no progress is reported.\n\nCompanies acknowledged Friday's agreement was a modest step and appealed to both governments to step up efforts to end the fight that is battering manufacturers and farmers.\n\nMr Trump said Friday's deal has yet to be put down on paper but said, \"We should be able to get that done over the next four weeks.\"\n\nChina's government welcomed \"substantial progress\" but gave no details of possible agreements.\n\n\"I don't think it's a victory, but it eases the situation,\" said economist Yu Chunhai at Renmin University in Beijing. He said both sides want to restore business and consumer confidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Significant work ahead'\n\nThere was no word of agreements on the core issues that sparked the dispute. Those include U.S. pressure on Beijing to roll back plans for government-led creation of global competitors in robotics, electric cars and other technologies.\n\n\"There remains significant work ahead to address many of the most important U.S. trade and investment priorities,\" Myron Brilliant, executive vice president of the US Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. Still, he called Friday's announcement a \"ray of hope.\"\n\nWashington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say China's plans violate its market-opening obligations and are based on stealing or pressuring companies to hand over technology. Chinese leaders see those tactics as the surest path to prosperity and global influence.\n\n\"With the key structural issues no closer to being resolved, we suspect that a mini deal would, at best, simply delay a breakdown in the negotiations,\" said Julian Evans-Pritchard and Martin Lynge Rasmussen of Capital Economics.\n\nThe looming December 15 tariff hike leaves a \"black cloud\" over Apple and other tech companies with factories or customers in China, said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities in a report. He said it would be a \"gut punch\" if it goes ahead.\n\nUS complaints about Chinese technology policies, cyber spying and protection of patents and other intellectual property \"will be the focus of tech investors,\" said Ives.\n\nAnother potential stumbling block is how to enforce any agreement.\n\nAAP", "description": "Australian shares are expected to surge Monday after a partial break through\u00a0 in the trade war between the United States and China and a burst of optimism about a Brexit deal triggered a global rally in shares late last week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3211%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_287%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/10a67bb03ea0f498eaa494241b307e4ac28c1d71", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
