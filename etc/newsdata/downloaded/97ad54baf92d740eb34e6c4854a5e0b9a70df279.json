Ilhan Omar\u2019s (D-MN) \u201canti-Semitic slurs.\u201d\n\nThe attack ads were released by the American Action Network, a group founded by President Richard Nixon\u2019s so-called \u201cJew counter,\u201d the late Fred Malek.\n\nThe series of ads specifically attack lawmakers including Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA), Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), Haley Stevens (D-MI), and Dean Phillips (D-MN), demanding they call for Omar to be removed from the Foreign Affairs Committee. Except for Stevens, the other three all serve on the committee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to stand up to hate,\u201d the ad says.\n\nThe ads refer to Omar\u2019s \u201clatest comments,\u201d which were in fact from five months ago. At the time, Omar publicly objected to \u201cthe political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country,\u201d referring to pro-Israel lobbying by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy is it okay for me to talk about the influence of the NRA (National Rifle Association), of fossil fuel industries or Big Pharma, and not talk about a powerful lobbying group that is influencing policies?\u201d she said.\n\nOmar was accused of reinforcing an anti-Semitic trope that Jews harbor \u201cdual loyalty\u201d to both the United States and Israel. When criticized, however, she insisted that opposing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the occupation of Palestine \u201cis not the same as being anti-Semitic.\u201d\n\nOmar later apologized for the remarks.\n\nOur democracy is built on debate, Congresswoman! I should not be expected to have allegiance/pledge support to a foreign country in order to serve my country in Congress or serve on committee. The people of the 5th elected me to serve their interest. I am sure we agree on that! https://t.co/gglAS4FVJW \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) March 3, 2019\n\nPresident Donald Trump himself came under fire just last week, after he used a similar claim to criticize Democrats. Speaking with reporters, the president suggested \u201cany Jewish people that vote for a Democrat\u201d are showing \u201ca total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about the comment the following day, Trump made clear that he meant that such an individual would be \u201cvery, very disloyal to Israel and to the Jewish people.\u201d\n\nThe Republican-aligned American Action Network did not put out any ads criticizing the president\u2019s remarks.\n\nThe American Action Network was founded in 2009 by Malek, who died earlier this year.\n\nMalek was responsible for carrying out one of the last state-sanctioned acts of anti-Semitism. In 1971, Nixon, who believed that Democratic Jews working in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) were trying to rig unemployment reports in a way that politically hurt him, tasked Malek with rooting out \u201cimportant Jewish officials.\u201d Four such officials were demoted following that witch hunt.\n\nThough Malek claimed he had nothing to do with the subsequent demotions, memos later showed that he was specifically responsible for them.\n\nThe American Action Network ads released this month represent the latest attempt to weaponize claims of anti-Semitism against one of the only two Muslim women in Congress. This week, the Alabama Republican Party approved a resolution calling on Omar to be expelled from Congress, describing her rhetoric as running \u201ccounter to American values and patriotism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOmar was not impressed, noting the state party\u2019s past support for \u201caccused child molester\u201d Roy Moore in his failed 2017 Senate bid.\n\nSorry, @ALGOPHQ, but this is a representative democracy. I was elected with 78% of the vote by the people of Minnesota's 5th District, not the Alabama Republican Party. If you want to clean up politics, maybe don\u2019t nominate an accused child molester as your Senate candidate? https://t.co/r9NvsZKRUw \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) August 27, 2019\n\nSeveral years ago, the American Action Network also put out ads attacking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which portrayed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) as a \u201cCommie dictator.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Omar-attack-ad-1.jpg?w=1434&h=807&crop=1"}
