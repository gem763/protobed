The whole of the UK and the whole of the EU. Let me add also that it is high time to turn good intentions in a legal text,\" he said.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson had previously said he wants to reach a Brexit deal at an EU summit on Thursday and Friday to allow for an orderly departure on October 31.\n\nThe main problem remains the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and how to prevent it becoming a backdoor into the EU after Brexit.\n\nA border on the island could undermine the 1998 peace agreement that helped end three decades of sectarian violence.\n\nBarnier is set to give a press conference at 10 am CEST.
