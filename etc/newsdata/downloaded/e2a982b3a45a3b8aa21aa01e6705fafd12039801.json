The European Open is not Wimbledon, the US Open or the Davis Cup final, but it features excellent players.\n\nMurray still has worked to do to get back to the top but he has made extraordinary progress\n\nComing back to win it from a barely standing start six months ago will rank alongside all of his more obvious feats.\n\nIt is too early to say whether he can ultimately challenge for the biggest prizes in a hugely physical sport that requires a man to win seven times in a fortnight over best of five sets.\n\nYet what seemed an absurd proposition only a matter of weeks ago suddenly looks less fanciful. And this time I will be reserving judgement.", "description": "MIKE DICKSON: Having witnessed Andy Murray emerge from a Scottish backwater to break the mould of underachieving British tennis I should have known better.", "authors": ["Mike Dickson For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/20/19964162-0-image-a-12_1571600050732.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
