The Fox poll is notable because support for his removal is now in the majority.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nAs he has done other times recently, Trump also attacked the network itself and some of their personalities who have been critical of him.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter, \u201cFrom the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNewsPoll. Whoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme\u2026Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile(who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN ), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President!\u201d\n\n\u2026Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fox News poll is conducted by Beacon Research, a Democratic firm, and Shaw & Company, a Republican one. The poll got an \u201cA\u2019 rating from a FiveThirtyEight survey last year of accuracy and methodology.\n\nLess than a half hour later, Trump praised One America News Network, a smaller rival to Fox News in reaching conservative audiences.\n\n\u201cThank you to @OANN One America News for your fair coverage and brilliant reporting. It is appreciated by many people trying so hard to find a new, consistent and powerful VOICE! See you tonight at the Big Rally in Minneapolis.\u201d\n\nTrump is scheduled to hold a rally in downtown Minneapolis on Thursday evening.\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
