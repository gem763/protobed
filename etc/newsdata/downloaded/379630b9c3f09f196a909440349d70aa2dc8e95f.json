He'll be here when it gets done and hopefully it's done soon.\n\n\"Once camp starts, you hate missing days. It's days you don't get back in terms of the preparation. All we worry about is getting a deal done.\"\n\nCalgary opens the regular season Oct. 3 against the Colorado Avalanche, who upset the Flames in five games in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nAny exchange of personnel involving the NHL's Battle of Alberta is intriguing to hockey fans in the province.\n\nCam Talbot and Mike Smith signing with Calgary and Edmonton respectively on the first day of unrestricted free agency July 1 was essentially a goalie swap between the rival cities.\n\nTalbot had a brief stop in Philadelphia as a rental player to conclude last season, but the 32-year-old from Caledonia, Ont., spent the majority of the last four years with Calgary's northern neighbour.\n\nTalbot is expected to push David Rittich for starts in the Flames' net.\n\nAddition of Lucic\n\nBurly forward Milan Lucic is now a Flame after a July deal that sent James Neal to the Oilers.\n\nBoth are contract-heavy forwards trying to recover their peak form following disappointing campaigns.\n\nA Stanley Cup winner with the Boston Bruins in 2011, Lucic mustered six goals and 14 assists and was minus-9 in 79 games last season.\n\n\"Even if I had a good year last year, you always have something to prove and want to get better,\" said the 31-year-old from Vancouver.\n\n\"After having a subpar last year and a half, ever since I would say Christmas of 2017, I've been in a slump that I haven't been able to get out of.\n\n\"I think I've got a lot to prove and sometimes a fresh start is what gets guys going again.\"\n\nTop line poised for success\n\nCalgary's top line of Johnny Gaudreau (99 points), Sean Monahan (820 and Elias Lindholm (78), as well as captain and Norris Trophy winner Mark Giordano (78) are capable of making the Flames one of the highest-scoring teams in the league again.\n\n\"It's not an easy thing to finish first in the conference,\" Giordano said. \"We've got to take the positives out of last year too and not just the way it ended, the negative.\"\n\nFinnish defenceman Juuso Valimaki underwent surgery on a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee Aug. 28.\n\nThe 20-year-old said he suffered the injury earlier that month while training, but did not provide any details.\n\nCalgary's first-round draft pick in 2017 was expected to be a regular in the lineup this season. His absence, which will be weeks in duration, created an unusual scenario.\n\nThe Flames had bought out the final year of Michael Stone's contract \u2014 a cap hit of $3.5 million US \u2014 when the defenceman cleared waivers in August.\n\nStone was limited to 14 games last season because of a blood clot in his arm.\n\nThe 29-year-old from Winnipeg and the Flames agreed to a one-year contract worth the league-minimum $700,000 on the eve of medicals.\n\n\"The first conversation was a little unique. 'Hi Mike, remember me?\"' Treliving said.\n\n\"Even at the time we bought out Mike we knew we needed some more depth on the blue-line, NHL depth, real players.\n\n\"Two or three weeks later, Juuso blows out his knee and we explored the opportunity of bringing Mike back.\"\n\nStone was as surprised as anyone that he was a Flame again.\n\n\"I didn't see it playing out like this. I didn't even know this was possible,\" he said.\n\n\"It was a long month. Not knowing where you're going to have to drag your family to if you have to go somewhere else. With a young family, it was easy to come back.\n\n\"I wasn't really a part of it last season because of the injury and whatnot. It's a chance to start fresh, but start fresh with some familiarity.\"", "description": "Matthew Tkachuk remains unsigned as the Calgary Flames begin training camp, and veteran forward Milan Lucic is looking for a fresh start.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5281659.1568324900!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/tkachuk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
