Ron Taverner as the OPP's new commissioner.\n\nBlair, a 32-year veteran of the OPP, was in the running for the job. In December, Blair made a public appeal to Ontario's ombudsman to investigate what he called \"questions of political interference\" in Taverner's appointment. Taverner is a longtime friend of Ford and his family.\n\nOntario's integrity commissioner cleared Ford of allegations of political interference in Taverner's appointment.\n\nFord accuses Blair of 'unprovoked personal and political attack'\n\nBlair had also revealed documents that suggested Ford's staff wanted the OPP, which provides the premier's security, to spend more than $50,000 on a customized van.\n\nBlair is suing Premier Doug Ford for defamation. (Nathan Denette/Canadian Press)\n\nIn the defamation suit, Blair is suing Ford over statements he made in December and January suggesting that Blair broke the law by releasing confidential material obtained through his job as deputy commissioner of the OPP.\n\nFord denies that anything he said about Blair at the time was defamatory.\n\nIn their statement of defence, filed in April, lawyers for Ford say he made his comments about Blair to the media in response to \"a calculated, widely publicized, public, malicious and unprovoked personal and political attack.\" Ford's lawyers say Blair \"used and abused\" his position in the OPP to go after the premier.\n\nNone of the allegations in the case by either side has been proven in court.\n\nBlair was fired in early March, within days of Taverner withdrawing his name from contention for the top police job.\n\nOn Friday, Blair said his firing came as a shock, and resulted in him being cut off from the organization he spent more than three decades working with.\n\n\"We have been cut off from our OPP family,\" he said.\n\nBlair's wife, Danielle Blair, said the experience had been \"traumatizing.\"", "description": "With calls for a public inquiry and news of a $15-million lawsuit, a new chapter is unfolding in the feud between Ontario Premier Doug Ford and a man who served in the top ranks of the Ontario Provincial Police.", "authors": ["Provincial Affairs Reporter", "Mike Crawley Is Provincial Affairs Reporter In Ontario For Cbc News.
