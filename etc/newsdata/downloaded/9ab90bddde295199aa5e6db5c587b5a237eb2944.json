Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) as a third-party candidate, asserting that the failed presidential candidate was referring to Republicans.\n\n\u201cOn Friday, the NYT did a piece about a podcast Secretary Clinton did with David Plouffe.

HRC speculated that the only way the GOP is going to win in states where Trump can\u2019t hit a 50% majority is to 1) Suppress the vote, as they do widely and routinely, & 2) Bank on the 3rd party spoiler.\n\n\u201cAnd yes, she said that certain fringe members of the Democratic and Green parties are assets to the Russians,\u201d he continued. \u201cWell guess what folks? That\u2019s true. She didn\u2019t call anyone a spy, as some are wrongly asserting for their own political gain\u201d:\n\nAnd yes, she said that certain fringe members of the Democratic and Green parties are assets to the Russians.

While Clinton did not explicitly state that the \u201cRussians\u201d are grooming Gabbard, she openly expressed her belief that Gabbard is a \u201cfavorite of the Russians\u201d and implied during the interview that she is a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is a favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far. That\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she is also a Russian asset,\u201d Clinton stated.\n\n\u201cThey know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it\u2019s going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it,\u201d she continued.\n\nGabbard issued a strong response, calling Clinton \u201cthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long\u201d:\n\nGreat! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a \u2026 \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\n\u2026 powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose. It\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly. \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\nWhen asked if Clinton was, in fact, referring to Gabbard in that interview, Clinton spokesman Merrill told NBC News, \u201cIf the nesting doll fits.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s attack of Gabbard prompted a response from the president, who said, \u201cI don\u2019t know Tulsi, but she\u2019s not a Russian agent.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the one that\u2019s accusing everybody of being a Russian agent,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnybody that is opposed to her is a Russian agent, so that\u2019s a scam that was pretty much put down.\u201d", "description": "Hillary Clinton's spokesman said the New York Times wrongly claimed Hillary Clinton said the Russians were grooming Rep.
