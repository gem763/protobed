(House House)\n\n(This is part of an occasional series in which we explain what\u2019s behind a popular meme. We like to call it memesplaining; you might call it meme-ruining. Regardless, if you just chanced upon a joke, tweet, image, app or GIF you don\u2019t understand, we have the answers \u2014 insofar as answers can be had.)\n\nEverything is on fire and feels bad right now, but good news: You now have the option of inhabiting the body of a goose, flapping your wings and taunting a gardener with your mighty honk.\n\nWelcome to Untitled Goose Game, the video game where you are a goose and also the worst nightmare of the people who live in a once-peaceful village.\n\nAs a goose, you can walk, run, pick up objects, flap your wings and honk. We\u2019d say it\u2019s improbable that such a simple game would go as viral as it has in recent days, but \u201cArrest for Treason\u201d trended on Twitter today and it\u2019s not like anyone has any better ideas on how to cope with every thing that\u2019s going on.\n\nAnyway, Untitled Goose Game. Here is a guide to why goose, why now.\n\nWhat is Untitled Goose Game?\n\nUntitled Goose Game is an opportunity to be rewarded for causing mild horribleness and chaos, in the form of a $14.99 video game about a goose.\n\nYou play the goose. The villagers play the part of your lawful good foes, who want their radios and apples and flowers to stay just where they left them. Do not let order and rules and politeness win. Steal their glasses, taunt them with honks, drop the glasses out of their reach. Break through the fences and invade their beautiful backyards. Smash their fancy statues. Steal their lunch and have a picnic. Flap your wings and celebrate and honk.\n\nNobody gets really hurt, and you, the goose, are incapable of losing.\n\nWhere did it come from?\n\nAccording to Vulture\u2019s interview with the creators, the game began as a joke in Slack, the messaging platform that many companies use for their employees to talk to each other.\n\nThe low stakes of the game is intentional. \u201cWe never wanted there to be any threat of violence or open hostility between the players and the game,\u201d said Jacob Strasser of House House, the indie video game company based in Australia that made Untitled Goose Game.\n\nLongtime enthusiasts of chaotic energy will note that Untitled Goose Game is somewhat similar in concept to Goat Simulator, the 2014 video game in which you play a goat who can run, head-butt and lick objects. Goat Simulator\u2019s launch trailer was a shot-for-shot remake of the heart-wrenching trailer for Dead Island, a survivor horror game.\n\nBut unlike in Goat Simulator, where the humans are more like squishy objects, the villagers in Untitled Goose Game are organized foils to your mayhem. (More on that in a minute.)\n\nHow did this become a meme?\n\nIf you have ever watched people play video games on the Internet, then you\u2019ll know that there\u2019s a big market for games that let you (1) do silly things while recording your face, then (2) upload videos of your reactions to YouTube. Untitled Goose Game is perfect for this. Here\u2019s PewDiePie, a YouTuber with more than 100 million subscribers, making the goose honk a lot:\n\nThe simple design and mayhem of the game prompted a wave of memes over the past several days.\n\nThere\u2019s political satire:\n\nI'll never forget \u2014 a burly man came up to me, a serious tough guy \u2014 he owns a pub here \u2014 he comes up to me, and he says \u2014 you wouldn't want to fight him! \u2014 and he's crying, and he says, thank you for getting rid of the goose, sir. And he's crying because we got the goose, folks. \u2014 Max Read (@max_read) September 29, 2019\n\nPolitical appropriation (\u00e0 la Gritty):\n\nThe goose game is about being antifa pic.twitter.com/Ec2mlZUsOJ \u2014 We Liv in a society (@LivvyFanon) September 27, 2019\n\nCeleb endorsements:\n\nwelp as a contrarian, I wanted to hate goose game but I LOVE IT \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 29, 2019\n\nCeleb fan-fiction:\n\nsorry i had to pic.twitter.com/PDytVbWH68 \u2014 Kyle Buchanan (@kylebuchanan) September 29, 2019\n\nWhy is this fun?\n\nYou would ask such a question? Okay, yes: As the goose, you are basically a jerk. But the villagers are not innocent victims as much as they are sentient obstacles. Their humanity is limited. The gardener is not a man trying to provide for his family, but a silly person who left the gate to his garden open, practically inviting you to drag away his pumpkins. The gardener exists to have his pumpkins stolen; feeling sorry for him would be like feeling sorry for steam that evaporates.\n\nAnother vital element of Untitled Goose Game is how silly the goose looks while terrorizing the village. After plucking a rose out of the garden, for instance, you\u2019ll look like an angry, honking contestant on a goose version of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d\n\nAll this, set to the thrilling sounds of Claude Debussy\u2019s \u201cPreludes.\u201d\n\nWhat will happen to me after I play this game?\n\nYou will become a person who finds it enjoyable to force a virtual gardener to wear his sun hat, not by kindly bringing it to him, but by waiting until he\u2019s about to nail down an anti-goose sign and then honking to scare him so he hits his thumb and then, when he falls down, stealing his flat cap so he has no choice but to wear his sun hat.\n\n\u201cVirtual\u201d is the key word there. Untitled Goose Game is a safe, socially acceptable way to relieve stress. It\u2019s the new punching a wall. It\u2019s the new crying at your desk.\n\nHow much can I honk?\n\nInfinitely.\n\nRead more:\n\nWelcome to the online search for a cursed sarcophagus that will finally end it all\n\nA step-by-step guide to why people can\u2019t stop arguing about \u2018cancel culture\u2019\n\nCongratulations to this egg on becoming Instagram\u2019s most-liked post ever", "description": "honkHONKhonkhonkhonkHONKhonkhonk", "authors": ["Reporter Covering Digital Culture", "Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter", "September At Pm", "Abohlheiser Covers Digital Culture For The Washington Post.
