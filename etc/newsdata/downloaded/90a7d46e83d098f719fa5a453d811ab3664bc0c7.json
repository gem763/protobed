This culture of easy come, easy go is likely to end in tears and it's going to hurt ordinary people who are normally quite responsible but are being enticed into getting into debt.'\n\nThe NatWest figures, which are based on internal research to help with setting up its new digital bank Bo, are echoed elsewhere.\n\nA study by debt charity Stepchange last week found that the number of middle-class families at risk of falling into debt is spiralling.\n\nIt helped 9,510 people with net incomes above \u00a340,000 last year, a rise of almost a fifth compared with three years ago.\n\nThe research into 750,000 NatWest customers reveals that the problem is not just confined to low-earning households who genuinely struggle to get by, but is also common among the better-off (file photo)\n\nTheir average credit card debt was \u00a321,091, while their average total outstanding debt, excluding mortgages, came to \u00a338,164.\n\nAnd the Money Charity said the average credit card debt per UK household was \u00a32,609 in July this year.\n\nLast year research from the charity found that almost ten million households have no savings at all and 19.3million (71 per cent) have less than \u00a310,000 in savings.\n\nSue Anderson, of Stepchange, said: 'The most common reason for problem debt is that people have experienced some kind of income shock \u2013 a sudden reduction in earnings, or reduced hours for example.\n\n'At times like these, many people would expect savings to be a lifeline, but current economic pressures can make it difficult to save. Instead, individuals have to live hand to mouth.'\n\nShe added that having even \u00a31,000 of savings can almost halve the risk of experiencing problem debt.\n\n'Our research shows that, if every household had \u00a31,000 of accessible savings, 500,000 fewer households would face problem debt,' she said.\n\n'The Government needs to do more to encourage individuals to build up their financial resilience.'", "description": "Figures from NatWest bank reveal that 50 per cent of adults in Britain do not put anything aside when they are paid each month (file photo).", "authors": ["Lucy White", "Miles Dilworth For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/21/19966096-0-image-a-103_1571604863587.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
