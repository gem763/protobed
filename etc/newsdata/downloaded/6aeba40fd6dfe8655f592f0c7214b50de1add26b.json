Indigenous leaders, in turn, will call on their followers to end protests and street blockades.\n\n\u201cComrades, this deal is a compromise on both sides,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cThe indigenous mobilisation will end and Decree 883 will be lifted.\u201d\n\nThe two sides will work together to develop a package of measures to cut government spending, increase revenue and reduce Ecuador\u2019s unsustainable budget deficits and public debt.\n\nIn the park that was the centre of the protests, demonstrators armed with wooden sticks and improvised shields shouted: \u201cWe did it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy I don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t have words, I\u2019m so emotional. At least God touched the president\u2019s heart,\u201d said protester Rosa Matango. \u201cI am happy as a mother, happy for our future. We indigenous people fought and lost so many brothers, but we\u2019ll keep going forward.\u201d\n\nCaravans of cars roamed the streets early on Monday honking in celebration, passengers shouting, banging pots and waving Ecuadorian flags.\n\n\u201cThe moment of peace, of agreement, has come for Ecuador,\u201d said Arnaud Peral, the United Nations\u2019 resident coordinator in Ecuador and one of the mediators of the nationally televised talks. \u201cThis deal is an extraordinary step.\u201d\n\nWearing the feathered headdress and face paint of the Achuar people of the Amazon rainforest, the president of the Confederation of Indigenous Nations, Jaime Vargas, thanked Moreno and demanded improved long-term conditions for indigenous Ecuadorians.\n\n\u201cWe want peace for our brothers and sisters in this country,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want more repression.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Indigenous leaders (eft) attend negotiations with President Len\u00edn Moreno (third from right) in Quito.

But by Sunday afternoon the air was white with smoke from burning tyres and teargas after more than 24 hours of clashes between police and hardcore protesters with sticks and shields of satellite dishes or plywood. Adjoining streets were piled high with burned tires, tree branches and paving stones.\n\nThe public ombudsman\u2019s office said on Sunday that seven people had died in the protests, 1,340 had been hurt and 1,152 arrested. The government loosened a 24-hour curfew imposed on Saturday, allowing people to move freely around the capital between 11am. and 8pm.\n\nThe protests have drawn thousands of Ecuadorians from outside the indigenous minority.\n\nMoreno served the former president, Rafael Correa, as vice-president before he become president and the two men went through a bitter split as Moreno pushed to curb public debt amassed on Correa\u2019s watch.", "description": "President cancels austerity package that sparked weeks of violent street demonstrations", "authors": ["Associated Press In Quito"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7088376f7a973d6ac1141ef000fc6445f15c1b3/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5858a34d6f625d0b5d56cc6fb374c489", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
