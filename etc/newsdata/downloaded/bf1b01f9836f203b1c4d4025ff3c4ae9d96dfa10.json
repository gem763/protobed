And they're praised for it and the women are looked down upon for it. But I feel like it's good [to do] because once you realize you're confident and good at it, then you're even better at what you do.\"\n\nShe added: \"It's not out of cockiness. I've won five world titles and if I say, 'I'm the best gymnast there is,' [the reaction is] 'Oh, she's cocky. Look at her now.' No, the facts are literally on the paper. I think it's important to teach [young girls] that.\"\n\nBiles now owns a strong case as the best gymnast in history and she could end any type of debate with an all-around gold medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics next year in Tokyo.\n\nThe 22-year-old is likely to emerge as the face of Team USA next summer and could be the biggest name on the global stage following the retirements of American swimmer Michael Phelps and Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt after the 2016 Summer Games.\n\n\"I try to stay focused on myself and the expectations I have for myself going in. But at times it's overwhelming,\" Biles told Armour about being in the spotlight. \"I don't know. Somehow I just manage it.\"\n\nHer success, which is highlighted by 27 medals, including 20 gold, between the Olympics and the World Championships, is something that's caught even her off guard at times.\n\n\"I wish I could have an out-of-body experience to witness it because sometimes I think I'm going crazy,\" Biles said. \"I really don't know how I do it sometimes.\"\n\nIn a sport where athletes peak early, usually in their teens, Biles has now been the best gymnast is the world for six years, and the gap between the American and her closest competition is seemingly growing.", "description": "American superstar  Simone Biles  captured her fifth all-around title at the 2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Germany this week, and she wants to use her success to inspire young girls to become the best in the world at their craft...", "authors": ["Tim Daniels"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/832/668/hi-res-da21a0eb7db0048ca2e26dce448c5ed1_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
