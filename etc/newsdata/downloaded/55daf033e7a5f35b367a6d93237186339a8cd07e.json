Branson was born with a birth defect called craniosynostosis, which occurs when the skull's bones fuse before the brain is fully formed\n\nBranson's mother was told by doctors that he needed surgery to fix the condition. Pictured: Branson in the hospital\n\nIn the video, Branson is seen walking down the halls of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington, accompanied by a nurse.\n\n'I'm right in front of you,' his mother says off-camera. 'You're doing so good! Good boy!'\n\nNormally, an infant's skull has several bone plates separated by sutures, which are rigid joints. As a baby grows, the sutures close and a single piece of bone forms.\n\nBut in those with craniosynostosis, the sutures close too early, which causes problems with normal brain and skull growth.\n\nIn addition to changes of the shape of the head and face, sufferers can also experience sleepiness, increased irritability, seizures and vomiting.\n\nThe condition occurs in one out of every 2,000 live births and more so in males than females, according to Columbia University Irving Medical Center.\n\nSurgery is often the recommended treatment and, typically, before the child is one year old when the bones are still soft and are easy to remodel.\n\nBranson's mother, Heather, said she knew something was wrong with her son because he would often wake up crying in the middle of the night.\n\nWorried, she took him to see his doctor, who - after examining Branson - referred him to get a CT scan.\n\nThe results showed that he had craniosynostosis.\n\nHeather went to different doctors to ask opinions of how to treat Branson. Some said he needed surgery immediately, while others said to wait until he's older.\n\n'I felt in my gut that he needed the help now,' she told DailyMail.com.\n\nBranson has a seven-hour cranial vault remodeling surgery to remodel the shape of his skull so his brain can properly grow. Two days later, Branson walked down the halls of Vermont Medical Center. Pictured: Branson with his father after surgery, left, and walking after surgery, right\n\nFour days after his surgery, doctors discharged Branson (pictured) and allowed him to go home\n\nComplications following such a surgery include fevers, vomiting, a lack of alertness and redness and swelling by the incision areas.\n\nHeather visited several hospitals before deciding on the Vermont Medical Center and scheduling his surgery.\n\n'I had a hard time with deciding if what I was doing was right,' she said.\n\n'But with support from online forums and Facebook groups of families with children with craniosynostosis, I knew it was the right thing.'\n\nOn Wednesday, Branson underwent a seven-hour cranial vault remodeling surgery to reshape the bones of his skull.\n\nJust two days later, with a bandage wrapped around his head, and wearing a blue and red onesie, video shows the toddler taking his first steps.\n\nHeather shared the video to Facebook with a caption that read: '[This] is him 2 days post op walking for the first time since surgery!! God is so good! He's our cranio warrior!'\n\nFour days after the surgery, doctors cleared Branson to go home.\n\n'He should be totally okay now,' Heather said. 'He just [has] to go back to doctors for checkups but he should live a normal life and grow normally.'\n\nShe says that she shared this video to help raise awareness of craniosynostosis and to inspire other families dealing with similar conditions.", "description": "Branson Figueroa, two, from Nottingham, New Hampshire, was born with a skull defect called craniosynostosis.
