It showed how our life is going to change in the next five, 10 or 20 years.\n\nJapanese companies said despite the hi-tech nature of their products, their aim is to \"make society more human and inclusive\".\n\nOne of the innovations on display is e-skin, designed by start-up Xenoma.\n\nIt has developed \"intelligent\" trousers and sleeves that can show up body movements.\n\nBianka Hamann, of Xenoma, said the trousers contain seven sensors that transmit the movements to a hub on her back.\n\n\"This hub sends the data to the computer and to our monitor via bluetooth. And then you can see, very clearly, simple or even bigger movements on the monitor in real time.\"\n\nIt's hoped the technology will be used for sport or medicine, for instance during rehabilitation.\n\nAnother idea on display was Skydrive, a taxi equipped with three wheels and four propellers that could put an end to traffic jams. The first manned test flight is scheduled to take place next year.\n\nTomohiro Fukuzawa, President of Skydrive, said: \"The good thing is that you don\u2019t need the same driving skills as for flying a helicopter or an airplane. The only thing we have to do is go back, right, forward, so anyone who can play with a drone can use this air mobility in the future.\"\n\nThe Japanese pavilion was equipped with a holographic display that projects videos in mid-air.\n\nKazuhiro Yamamoto, Chief Global Strategist of Asukanet, said: \"We want to support innovation with user-friendly interfaces for an inclusive and human-centered society.\"\n\nThe Japanese start-up Empath has developed software that can detect human emotions, not by what you say, but by how you say it.\n\nHazumu Yamazaki, of Empath, said the device can identify four emotions, including joy, calm, anger and sorrow.\n\nCurrently used to improve call centres, this innovation was first designed for the mental health sector to help identify which earthquake victims needed help from care workers and psychiatrists.\n\nIFA Executive Director, Jens Heithecker, said Japan's inventive talent is the country's key strength.\n\n\"When we were in Japan and went to the big tech companies, or when we experienced the vibrant start up-scene in Kyoto, or when we saw how many international staff members work in major enterprises or in start-ups nowadays, you can see a real openness. In this respect, Japan is the right partner country for IFA Next.\"", "description": "What are the next trends in consumer electronics and home appliances?
