Bubble tea is quickly becoming New York City\u2019s \u201cit\u201d drink.\n\nA growing number of shops specializing in the Asian favorite, which combines tea with tapioca pearls (or bubbles or boba, as they are called), are opening throughout the metropolitan region. Major chains are expanding, while newer brands are starting up or finding their way into the market from other locales.\n\nIn the process, the drink is undergoing a transformation. Bubble tea now comes in countless variations, including versions topped with cream cheese or a foamy \u201cmilk cap\u201d or flavored with a syrup of brown sugar. The drink is also often offered with customizable options, including varying the amounts of ice or sugar or even picking types of bubbles beyond the tapioca ones.\n\nKung Fu Tea, a New York City-based chain that has locations throughout the world, estimates that when all the variations are added up, it offers more than 3,000 drink possibilities. The chain, which added five new stores in the metro area this year for a total of 43 throughout New York and New Jersey, also offers drinks without tea.\n\n\u201cYou can even get coffee,\u201d said Mai Shi, a Kung Fu Tea spokeswoman. (And, yes, you can add bubbles to your coffee, Ms. Shi noted.)\n\nThe newest extreme? Alcoholic bubble tea. It will be offered starting in mid-September by Bubbleology, a United Kingdom-based company whose first New York store, located in Manhattan\u2019s East Village neighborhood, is currently in a soft-opening phase.\n\nTwo bubble tea options with alcohol at Bubbleology.

The market wants it,\u201d Mr. Khan said.\n\nSome chains are taking bubble tea in a more artisanal direction, touting where they source ingredients for drinks or how they carefully craft them. Luigi\u2019s Ice Cream, a New Jersey-based chain that added bubble tea to its menu in recent months, notes that it makes its bubbles fresh every three hours.\n\nOtherwise, the pearls just don\u2019t have the same textural appeal, said chain founder Luigi Beltran. \u201cThey get very hard and very gummy,\u201d he said.\n\nBubble tea is hardly a new phenomenon. The drink traces its roots back to Taiwan in the \u201880s, according to those in the industry, and made its way to New York City at least a decade ago.\n\nThe current growth in bubble-tea shops reflects the increasing interest in Asian food and beverages, observers of the culinary scene said. As for why so many chains are coming up with new twists on the drink, it speaks to the need to differentiate in a more crowded market, said observers.\n\nA Passion in Paradise cocktail is prepared at Bubbleology.

Then again, Danielle Chang, founder of LuckyRice, a lifestyle brand that promotes Asian food events, said the same could have been said of Starbucks Corp. and the gourmet-coffee trend of decades ago.\n\nMs. Chang is convinced that bubble tea, in all its variety, is here to stay. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of Asian cuisine going mainstream,\u201d she said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Where was the best bubble tea you\u2019ve had?
