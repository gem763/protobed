Within 24 hours, 30 percent of the plant was in production,\" said Abdulkareem.\n\n\"We will have production at the same level as before the strike by the end of this month -- we are coming back stronger.\"", "description": "The dramatic weekend assault on two Saudi oil facilities saw one of the targets struck four times sparking fires that took five hours to extinguish, the national oil company said Friday.
