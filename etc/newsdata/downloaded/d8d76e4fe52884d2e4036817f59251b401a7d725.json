The sushi may have looked appealing many years ago when it was all you could afford on a college student budget, but you look at it now as you stand in line to pay for gas and you know it\u2019s probably been there too long, the fish probably isn\u2019t real and the rice is most likely stale. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess whether the seaweed has gone bad, yet there it is, placed in a cooler where it will remain on sale for as long as time itself continues ticking forward. Just because you can eat gas station sushi, it doesn\u2019t mean you should.\n\nIn a recent op-ed, Mr. Chafee reminded those who actually remember he exists that several years ago he joined the Libertarian Party, and will perhaps be seeking the Libertarian nomination for president. For those who do remember him, it must have been confusing to remember which party he had been with previously. Mr. Chafee over the last three decades has been elected to various offices as an independent, a Republican and a Democrat. The last time anyone paid any real attention to him was in 2016, when Mr. Chafee, perhaps bored and lonely, decided he wanted to jump into the middle of Hillary\u2019s coronation and run for president, lasting one debate and then fading back into obscurity.\n\nMr. Chafee\u2019s potential addition to the 2020 field would be a funny and ironic one. Much like former Republican Govs. Gary Johnson and Bill Weld (who is running for the Republican nomination this go-around), Mr. Chafee could come into the Libertarian National Convention, get yelled at by the anarchist wing, and then end up pulling through and getting the nomination because the Libertarian Party\u2019s standards are so low.\n\nMr. Chafee\u2019s legislative record is horrifyingly un-libertarian (as governor of Rhode Island alone he received a \u201cD\u201d from the libertarian Cato Institute and received an \u201cF\u201d from the NRA) but records don\u2019t really matter in them, it certainly didn\u2019t stop them from nominating Republican Congressman Bob Barr in 2008 or granting Bill Weld the VP position in 2016. In fact, there are many Libertarian delegates and committee members hoping that if (when) Mr. Weld gives up his longshot primary campaign, he\u2019ll come back to the Libertarian Party and run as their presidential nominee. There are even some very enthusiastic Libertarian activists who are pleading for Republican-turned-independent Congressman Justin Amash to run for their party\u2019s nomination.\n\nSeeing a trend? The Libertarian Party loves people who don\u2019t love them. Mr. Weld could have essentially had a guaranteed nomination but instead decided he hates President Trump more than he wants to spread libertarian ideals. Mr. Amash could have easily converted to the Libertarian banner, but instead decided it was a better ideal to stay out of a partisan relationship and just be happily single. That\u2019s saying something when you\u2019d rather run for office alone than take even some degree of party support.\n\nThe Libertarian Party is so desperate for attention, they\u2019d probably take Mr. Chafee over longtime party members in a heartbeat, and to an extent, I don\u2019t blame them. Their current lineup of candidates includes boot-hat wearing Vermin Supreme (imagine watching on C-SPAN), the infamous (and on the run from the FBI) John McAfee, self-described [expletive] Arvhin Vohra (who joked about mass shootings of school boards being a good thing), and a whole slew of remaining candidates who have never held office, have no claim to fame, and all have probably as much of a chance of being president as Mr. Chafee when you step back and really think about it.\n\nLibertarians, to their credit, in 2016 despite every gaffe and bump in the road reached record numbers in party membership enrollment and victories in local elections. For a moment in time, even a handful of elected Republicans in state legislatures throughout the country transitioned from Republican to Libertarian, only to retire by choice at the end of their term or be retired by the ballot. Despite running against two of history\u2019s most unpopular candidates, the Johnson-Weld ticket barely scratched the popular vote, and with that disappeared the dreams of many.\n\nThird parties are important in American politics, despite their actual electoral impact. They force candidates on the record and bring up issues that often go ignored. What does Mr. Chafee bring to the table? Some more \u201cNever-Trump\u201d mudslinging? A chance to talk about holding the political center? You\u2019re guess is as good as mine, but at this point in time, they\u2019d probably take Joe Walsh if it meant some free air time on MSNBC.\n\n\u2022 Remso W.
