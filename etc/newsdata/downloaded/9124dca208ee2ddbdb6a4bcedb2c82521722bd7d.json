Kate gave me a lot of courage as a new mother that I could look nice again and be well dressed.\n\n'I love her self-confidence. It is very important for a great look.

Actually, most of the items I have are from second-hand shops, and I often find a matching garment at H&M. Rarely do I order from online shops.\n\n'Because I find a lot in second-hand shops, it is not too expensive.. I would say, on average I spend around \u20ac25 to \u20ac100 per outfit.\n\n'I love how they interact with people, I'm impressed by their social engagement. Kate and Meghan have shown me that strong women can create and achieve great things.\n\nThe royal fan has even started keeping track of the outfits the Duchess of Sussex steps out in too.
