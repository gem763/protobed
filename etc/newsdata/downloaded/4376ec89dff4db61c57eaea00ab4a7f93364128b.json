REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo\n\nAs Germany gears up for a year of celebrations to mark the demise of the Wall, the Cold War\u2019s most potent symbol, in November 1989 and German reunification a year later, the report\u2019s findings help explain a surge in support for the far-right among eastern voters.\n\nOn the face of it, the East has come far.\n\n\u201cNumerous indicators show that we have made a lot of progress in the convergence of living conditions between East and West since 1990,\u201d said Christian Hirte, the government\u2019s commissioner for the east.\n\nBy 2018, East Germany\u2019s economic strength had risen to 75% of the west German level from 43% in 1990. Employment is at a high in the east and wages there are 84% of those in the west.\n\nHowever, people\u2019s attitudes tell a different story.\n\nThe annual report on \u2018the state of German unity\u2019 also cited a recent survey carried out for the government showing that 57% of east Germans felt like second-class citizens.\n\nOnly 38% of those asked in the East see reunification as a success, including only 20% of people younger than 40 years.\n\n\u201cThis dissatisfaction is expressed in the election results in the east and west in recent years which show significant differences,\u201d said the report, saying one of the causes of the dissatisfaction is painful and deep upheaval in the east.\n\nHirte, acknowledging that the convergence process was not yet complete, cited depopulation - 2 million people, especially young people and women, have left the region in the last three decades and few big global firms have moved in.\n\nVoters in the east are deserting the traditional parties - Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives and her coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD) - and embracing the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and radical Left Party.\n\nFAR-RIGHT RIOTS\n\nThe AfD came second in elections in the eastern state of Saxony and Brandenburg earlier this month, winning roughly 27% and 23% of the vote respectively. Polls in the state of Thuringia, which goes to the polls next month, show the AfD on 25%, just behind the Left, which includes former Communists.\n\nNationally, the AfD, which has capitalised on voter resentment over Merkel\u2019s open-door migrant policy, is polling at around 14%.\n\nOutbreaks of violence, such as last year\u2019s far-right riots in the eastern city of Chemnitz - the worst such clashes Germany had seen in decades - have reinforced the picture of a disenchanted and radicalised east.\n\nHirte acknowledged that xenophobic attitudes had to be overcome, while industry groups have warned that they could damage the prospects for investment in the region.", "description": "A majority of Germans in the former communist East feel like second-class citizens almost three decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall even though they are catching up economically with western regions, a government report showed on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433756590&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O154", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
