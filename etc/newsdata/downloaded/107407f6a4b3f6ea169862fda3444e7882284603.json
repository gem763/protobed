(Photo by James Devaney/Getty Images)\n\nDon\u2019t let the apparent failure of Big Baller Brand and Lonzo Ball\u2019s big move to the New Orleans Pelicans fool you. LaVar Ball still think he knows the way forward.\n\nThe Ball family addressed former business partner Alan Foster\u2019s alleged seven-figure embezzlement and the family\u2019s struggles with BBB in the latest episode of \u201cBall in the Family.\u201d One of the big topics was whether the name of the brand should be changed.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nUnsurprisingly, the eldest Ball was uninterested in renaming a business known for, alleged embezzlement aside, recently finding itself on clearance racks, receiving an \u201cF\u201d from the Better Business Bureau and making shoes that fell apart in minutes on the court.\n\nWhen Lonzo \u2014 who happens to reportedly own a majority of the company \u2014 challenged his father on that position, LaVar defended himself with a ... questionable analogy.\n\nThe exchange can be seen around the 16-minute mark:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying, BBB is always going to be the name on the fact that it also stands for the three Ball brothers. I\u2019m not changing that s--- at all,\u201d Ball said (h/t to LonzoWire).\n\n\u201cWhen I come out with a name and then somebody tells me to change it, that\u2019s like me telling me to change your name. That\u2019s like people saying \u2018Oh, hey, change Lonzo\u2019s name to Alfonzo on the fact that he been damaged goods for the last two years.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe \u201cdamaged goods\u201d line is no doubt a reference to the large amount of injuries Lonzo has experienced in his first two years in the league, limiting him to fewer than 50 games per season so far. Or it could just be a reference to Lonzo joining the Pelicans, who knows?\n\nStory continues\n\nPoking at your son\u2019s injuries is an interesting way of stating your case when the son also literally owns the business, but we\u2019re also talking about a man who thinks the best way to turn around a failing business is to change nothing.\n\nWhat followed was an exchange already seen in a \u201cBall in the Family\u201d trailer, with Lonzo getting real with LaVar about the brand and Foster:\n\nLONZO: The brand is demolished right now. LAVAR: That\u2019s how you feel, \u201cThe brand is demolished.\u201d LONZO: That\u2019s how everybody feels. LAVAR: Who\u2019s everybody? LONZO: The world. The consumers. LAVAR: The world? That\u2019s the consumers you\u2019ve talked to? LONZO: Yeah, it\u2019s all messed up right now. LAVAR: Why is it messed up? Because one person did something bad? LONZO: He was the main person. LAVAR: He wasn\u2019t the main person. LONZO: He ran everything.\n\nClearly, BBB is doing just fine, you guys.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Lonzo Ball wants to change the name of Big Baller Brand.
