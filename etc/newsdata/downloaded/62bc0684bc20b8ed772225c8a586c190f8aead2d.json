Staffers companywide objected this summer to the video platform\u2019s treatment of hate speech. Some LGBTQ employees, in particular, said Google no longer deserved to participate in commemorative Pride activities. Ms. Wojcicki apologized for her handling of those complaints, too.\n\nGoogle Chief Executive Sundar Pichai has become involved in righting the ship, The Wall Street Journal earlier reported.\n\nYouTube said this week that its new verified channels would now come with a look that \u201chelps distinguish the official channel of the creator, celebrity or brand it represents.\u201d The new look would be displayed more consistently across channel pages, search and comments, according to the company.\n\nIn conjunction with the news, announced in a blog post, some popular YouTube creators had received emails informing them about the loss of their verified status Thursday. The company said Friday that no one has lost a verification badge yet. The message should be treated as an advance notice that can be appealed, the company said.\n\nTwitter Inc., Facebook Inc. and Instagram have all made changes to their verification policies, which are designed to make it easier for the public to find the official accounts of their favorite celebrity, organization or brand.\n\nThe moves come as the video-streaming platform grapples with how to manage users on its platform. YouTube, which Google acquired in 2006, is the world\u2019s largest video-streaming platform. The company has said its users watch more than one billion hours of content each day. Over the past couple of years, the site has been criticized for the way its powerful recommendation engine can steer users to violent content or conspiracy theories, as well as how the platform protects its large numbers of young viewers.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Do verified accounts on YouTube affect your perception of their content? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nIn August, Google pulled 210 YouTube channels from its platform, citing evidence that the content appeared to be part of a coordinated disinformation campaign by the Chinese government in response to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nThe company has also said it would change its policies on how it protects children using its platform. Google recently agreed to pay a $170 million fine to settle a yearlong federal investigation into how YouTube collects data on children and sells ads for such products as Barbie dolls and Play-Doh. YouTube said it would provide new protections for children on its video platform.\n\n\u2014Rob Copeland contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Kimberly Chin at kimberly.chin@wsj.com", "description": "YouTube\u2019s Chief Executive Susan Wojcicki has apologized for concerns over the decision to remove the verification status of its content creators.", "authors": ["Kimberly Chin", "Kimberly.Chin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109492/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
