And why shouldn\u2019t they be suspicious, given incidents such as moderator Candy Crowley\u2019s infamous intervention in the second debate in 2012?\n\nTrumpian denunciations of \u201cfake news\u201d are a staple of every presidential rally, and Big Media\u2019s compilations of alleged \u201clies\u201d by the president are routine and routinely ignored or dismissed on the right. The anger and disdain toward the president and his administration in newsrooms \u2014 stoked by two years of dry-hole drilling by Robert S. Mueller III and now a sham impeachment \u2014 have bankrupted even the pretense of objectivity by Manhattan-Beltway media elites. Most everyone I work with \u2014 from left to right \u2014 tries to be fair in our questions and competent in our craft. But the overwhelming weight of the ideology of the collective newsroom has resulted in an avalanche of bias.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Manhattan-Beltway media elite seems to the center-right of the country at large to be overwhelmingly committed to the defeat of Trump. Essentially half of the United States expects the four debates will, in fact, be four ambushes by the combined forces of the Democratic nominee and the elite media operating in tandem, though not in explicit coordination. Look at the Gallup numbers: The media\u2019s credibility is shattered beyond repair. The self-proclaimed refs are not trusted by more than half of the public. That\u2019s undeniable anymore. Whatever one thinks of the justice of the public\u2019s verdict, it is the verdict.\n\nSo the assumptions on which the debate commission were founded are simply not applicable anymore. The commissioned hasn\u2019t failed in its mission. It has been overtaken by events on the ground, and any role it serves going forward will be meaningful only if its ground rules on moderators, question length and so on change dramatically.\n\nThe press isn\u2019t the \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d but it has been traumatized by so many shocks that it has lost self-awareness of the contempt in which it is held by large swaths of America. It is thus ridiculous to assign elite media any role in the campaign ahead based on legacy status, which is exactly what the commission has always done and will do again if not preempted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump is the incumbent who can restore presidential debates to serious exercises in exploring the crucial differences between the two major-party candidates, but he has to begin by taking a wrecking ball to the perceived entitlement of a system begun before cellphones and the Internet and built on the thoroughly debunked belief in media \u201cobjectivity.\u201d So start over. There are plenty of alternatives, and the best would involve open access and genuinely smart, diverse questioners who are not rehearsed to seek conflict, headlines or ratings. A lesser dose of media celebrity is a higher dose of fairness to the voters. (And please, no more idiotic \u201ctown halls.\u201d)\n\nAct quickly, Mr. President. The announcement won\u2019t end media bias. It won\u2019t heal any breaches. But the discussion of what, if anything, comes a year from now will be out on the table and openly debated, as it should be in a free republic.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The president should consign the Commission on Presidential Debates to the dustbin of history.", "authors": ["Hugh Hewitt"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KZvTeymZFiML-lPBQxRu27U1A_I=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q2R56CFZCMI6RIWFGGD7IJ7CKM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
