Also, that we are showing everyone that we welcome everyone,\u201d added the young man, who said he was an amateur YouTuber who produces art and music.\n\nNearby was a group of three Filipinos, who made the trip from Jeddah, about 800 kilometres (500 miles) west of Riyadh.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for such an event for so long,\u201d one of the young women told AFP before she bolted with her friends to listen to their \u201cfavourite\u201d song.", "description": "Riyadh (AFP) \u2013 The Saudi capital burst into life with the cheers of young fans of Korean pop group BTS as they performed in the kingdom seeking to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/4243ae_wildly-popular-pop-band-performed-in-saudi-arabia-time-friday-night-pop-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
