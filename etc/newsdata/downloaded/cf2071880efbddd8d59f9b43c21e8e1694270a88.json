This is the annual consumption of an average household \u2013 so a lot of energy,\u201d Energy Observer crew-member Am\u00e9lie Conty told The Independent.\n\nRenewable energies are known as fluctuant energies which means they cannot always be relied upon. Engineers decided to use hydrogen to plug the gap.\n\n\u201cWe use renewable energies all day long to charge our batteries and propel the boat. When we don\u2019t have enough of those renewable energies we have our own hydrogen on board that we use to propel the boat,\u201d Ms Conty said.\n\nThe ship \u2013 which has six crew members \u2013 relies on approximately 52 per cent of its energy from the sun, 42 per cent from its wings and six per cent from hydrogen.\n\nThe vessel itself is 35 years old and already sailed around the world several times before it was renovated with the new technology at a cost of $4.7m (\u00a33.8m).\n\n\u201cWe got it when it was a wreck and transformed it into the Energy Observer. The whole idea was to find a way to propel a boat without emitting any CO2 or greenhouse gases or any pollution,\u201d Ms Conty said.\n\nThe Oceanwing sails are 12 metres long and can rotate 360 degrees so they catch as much wind as possible. Engineers hope in the future the sails \u2013 which are completely automated \u2013 could be put on cargo ships to make them up to 42 per cent more energy efficient.\n\nThe aim of the expedition is to develop a commercial product which Ms Conty said should be available to vessels around the world in five to 10 years.\n\nThe boat, which is being led by founder and captain Victorien Erussard and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Delafosse, will visit 50 countries and 101 ports during its six-year journey. It was designed by the CEA-Liten research institute in Grenoble.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The main reason why we stop is to talk about the boat and the environment and the sustainable development goals of the UN,\u201d Ms Conty said.\n\n\u201cToday is quite a special day because of the big Extinction Rebellion protests which obviously we totally agree with and it\u2019s sad we can\u2019t be there with them. We really support what they\u2019re doing and they are in our thoughts.\u201d\n\nCrew say they want to prove that shipping can be made significantly more environmentally friendly.\n\nThey believe their energy mix could not only transform the shipping industry but could also be used for energy grids on land too.\n\nMs Conty said: \u201cIt\u2019s daunting when you realise to be honest, it\u2019s time we get a move on, it\u2019s almost too late. There\u2019s no more time for debating if it\u2019s true or not, it\u2019s now and that\u2019s it. I can\u2019t stress that enough.\n\n\u201cIn the Mediterranean we sailed on a sea that is almost dead. There are hardly any fish in it any more, half the time we tried to fish we ended up fishing plastic. When we did catch fish they were very small. Since we\u2019ve been in the boat we\u2019ve seen the effects of climate change everywhere.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of climate change are really really visible. The situation is dire, and it\u2019s easy for us to think: \u2018It\u2019s far away, it\u2019s not going to affect us.\u2019 But it is going to affect us and it\u2019s actually affecting us now. We really have to find solutions. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d", "description": "The world\u2019s first hydrogen-powered ship has arrived in London as part of a six-year, zero emissions voyage around the world. \u00a0 The 30-metre long Energy Observer catamaran has already travelled 18,000 miles since leaving Saint Malo on the west coast of France and will remain stationed by Tower Bridge for 10 days as it finishes its\u00a0European\u00a0tour.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston", "Maya Yagoda"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/07/16/energy-observer-amsterdam-april2019-copyright-energy-observer-amlie-conty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
