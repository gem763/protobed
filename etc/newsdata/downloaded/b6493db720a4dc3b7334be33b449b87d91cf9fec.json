The Surface Earbuds were announced at today\u2019s event in New York City. They\u2019ll be available \u201clater this year\u201d for $249. The Surface Earbuds are tuned for both music and voice performance \u2014 Microsoft is pitching them as a must-have Office accessory with dictation and excellent call quality. Each earbud has two microphones built in, which aid in noise reduction when you\u2019re speaking into them.\n\nMicrosoft claims the Surface Earbuds have \u201call-day comfort\u201d \u2014 they make contact with your ear in two places \u2014 and, with the included carrying case, offer up to 24 hours of battery life. You get eight hours of continuous playback on a charge, and the case contains enough for two full refills. As with many other wireless earbuds, they use tap and swipe gestures to control your music or other audio.\n\n\u201cOn Android, with a few simple taps, you can open Spotify, and it will start to play the right music for you in that moment. There\u2019s no screen required,\u201d said Microsoft\u2019s Robin Seiler. The Surface Earbuds also include integration with Microsoft Office, allowing for features like real-time captions during presentations and the ability to move through PowerPoint slides with a swipe of the touch area.\n\nBut I think the design is going to be, uh, pretty divisive. When in your ear, the Surface Earbuds have a very large circular look that\u2019s not at all discreet. \u201cWe looked at many options for ergonomics and weight. We created a simple design that balances against two points in your ear,\u201d said Seiler. The company says the Surface Earbuds offer excellent in-ear stability as a result of their unique design.\n\nThe Surface Earbuds join the Surface Headphones as Microsoft\u2019s flagship audio products. The company did not announce a sequel to the headphones today, however.", "description": "Microsoft is introducing a new pair of wireless earbuds to join the company\u2019s noise-canceling Surface Headphones.
