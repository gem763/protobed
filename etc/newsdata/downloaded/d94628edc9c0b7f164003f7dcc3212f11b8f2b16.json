Despite initial suggestions their schedule may not allow it, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex travelled to Rome on Thursday to attend the wedding of Meghan's close friend Misha Nonoo - and now they're on their way to Africa ahead of their royal tour.\n\nFashion designer Misha married energy entrepreneur Michael Hess on Friday 20 September in the Italian capital. While the ceremony itself took place at Villa Aurelia, a stunning wedding venue in the centre of Rome, as part of their wedding weekend the couple also hosted a party at Cinecitta, the iconic film studios where renowned Italian directors including as Rossellini, Fellini, and Visconti created their work.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle were photographed arriving at the venue on Friday evening in time for the sunset ceremony, with Meghan choosing a full-length, black, sheer Valentino dress for the occasion. Adhering to what looks to be a black tie dress code, Prince Harry looked smart in a tuxedo and bowtie.\n\nPhoto credit: Alessandro Serrano'/Shutterstock - Shutterstock More\n\nAlso in attendance at the high profile nuptials was Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom, Ivanka Trump, James Corden and wife Julia Carey, Karlie Kloss and Princess Beatrice.\n\nPhoto credit: Alessandro Serrano'/Shutterstock - Shutterstock More\n\nIt hadn't been confirmed until they made an appearance in Italy that Meghan and Harry would even be attending Misha and Michael's wedding, given how close it is to their Africa trip.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess begin a ten-day royal tour in the continent tomorrow (Monday, September 23) along with their baby son Archie, who didn't travel to Rome with them. But with the ceremony being on Friday instead of the expected Saturday, it meant the Sussexes had time to return home to their baby before departing for Cape Town ahead of their itinerary starting tomorrow.\n\nThe family will stay in Cape Town, South Africa for two days before Harry departs for Botswana, where he'll tour further until 1 October. The following day, Meghan and Harry (and potentially Archie) will travel to Johannesburg together to round off the trip - and we can't wait for the pictures if it's going to be anything like the Sussexes' Australia tour last year.", "description": "The Duke and Duchess managed to attend their friend's wedding before their tour of Africa kicks off.", "authors": ["Catriona Harvey-Jenner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8oR5XwOihkl6g51tmH0UtA--~B/aD03MjQ7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/0f7b70584e9d16281e68d434e7da064a", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
