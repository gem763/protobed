For decades, vegetarians and vegans have been the main market for such proteins, but that\u2019s now changing as consumers seek to diversify diets and opt for more environmentally friendly options.\n\n\u201cWe are already looking beyond peas,\u201d Azoulay said in an interview at the Future Food-Tech London summit. \u201cThe fava bean seems to be the most promising today, but it\u2019s still a work in progress.\u201d\n\nRoquette is also looking at expanding into processing lentils, mung beans, oats and rice, Azoulay said.\n\nThe closely held company extracts protein from peas, which is then used to make products such as vegan burgers, and has an agreement to supply Beyond Meat this year. To tap rising demand, it plans to more than double its pea-processing capacity from about 100,000 tons, and is building a plant in Canada\u2019s Manitoba province. The factory is scheduled to start production late next year and will be fully operational by early 2021.\n\nRoquette could use its current plants if it expands into fava beans, which are also known as faba or broad beans, because processing uses the same techniques and facilities as peas.\n\n(Updates with plans for Manitoba plant in penultimate paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Agnieszka de Sousa in London at atroszkiewic@bloomberg.net;Ashley Robinson in Winnipeg (Non BLP Loc) at arobinson193@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Nicholas Larkin, Liezel Hill\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- One of the world\u2019s biggest pea processors is considering expanding into fava beans as the boom in alternative proteins fuels demand for special crops.France\u2019s Roquette Freres SA is exploring processing the beans as consumers increasingly turn toward plant-based meats as well as substitute", "authors": ["Agnieszka De Sousa", "Ashley Robinson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/A2VDOmJ3AiGFbjyym5FSUA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/61dbf0064496bc7495cfee10605b29ae", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
