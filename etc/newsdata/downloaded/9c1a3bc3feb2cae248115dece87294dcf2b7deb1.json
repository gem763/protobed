In Vunipola\u2019s absence, however, Joe Marler and Ellis Genge have impressed, and it is not a given that Vunipola can count on what he has done over his 54 England appearances to date to walk straight back into the side.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

We will see in training. Like all of our front row, how they get up off the floor when they defend, how often they put themselves in positions to attack, repeat efforts in training. When we have scrums under duress, making sure they get up and work away from that. All the coaches have a look at how each player contributes. There are not so much set markers but how they contribute to training and beyond that what he does that is of value to the team.\n\n\u201cWe'll all have input on it and Eddie has the final say.\u201d\n\nSo far in Japan, Jones has decided to start with Marler and bring Genge off the bench, with the man dubbed \u2018the Baby Rhino\u2019 making a strong impact against the USA with a storming 50m break. Given that Marler retired from international rugby last September, it has been something of an unusual 12 months for the Harlequins loosehead, even by his account. But Hatley believes that the two performances delivered so far this tournament justifies his inclusion in Japan.\n\n\u201cJoe brings a real aggressive attitude to anything he does,\u201d added Hatley. \u201cHe hits hard defensively and he is a good set-piece technician. Joe has other parts to his game but those are the ones that really stand out.\n\n\u201cI thought towards the end of the season was probably as well as he has played and he has carried that form through. Against Tonga he was very good, it is not often you see Tongan forwards getting speared backwards and Joe was at the forefront of that. He scrummaged well against America. He is fitter than he was, he has come in and pitched himself into training after the break that he had. He is probably fitter than he has ever been and you see that around the pitch.\u201d\n\nShould Vunipola come straight back into the squad, one of Marler or Genge will miss out on selection against Argentina. \u201cThere are three guys going for two shirts, so that doesn't work,\u201d admitted Marler on Monday. \u201cIt's great to have Mako back and he's been in training for the last couple of weeks anyway.\n\n\u201cHe's back fully fit and he brings world class experience and talent into that role. So, I've enjoyed my time.\u201d\n\nJones will decide who gets the nod on Thursday when he announces his team, with Vunipola required to come through three consecutive days of live scrum training in order to show he is prepared to face Argentina \u2013 whose reputation as one of the most powerful scrummaging sides in world rugby goes before them.\n\nHatley added: \u201cHe will have to do what we put in front of him. There are no set numbers to it, if we feel the players are short we will put in some pick-ups. We will scrummage today, Tuesday and Wednesday so that should be sufficient.\u201d", "description": "England\u00a0are willing to fast-track Mako Vunipola into the starting line-up for this Saturday\u2019s crucial Rugby World Cup clash against Argentina, despite the prop playing just 17 minutes of rugby in four-and-a-half months.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/30/09/mako-vunipola.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
