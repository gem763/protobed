The trailer teases a plethora of meme-able, heartwarming Queer Eye moments from Jonathan Van Ness, Tan France, Antoni Porowski, Bobby Berk, and Karamo Brown\u2019s jaunt to Tokyo. They dance in a crosswalk! They eat sushi! A nice middle-aged woman says \u201cyaass queen\u201d and then slow dances in a kitchen with Antoni! Tan says one entire sentence in Japanese! He wears a kimono! After four seasons of plain ol\u2019 American Queer Eye, which saw the Fab Five bringing their Joyful Expertise to heartland-ish locales like Georgia and Kansas City, this extremely different cultural context will prove for an interesting watch. As 23-year-old Kae says in the trailer, \u201cI want to transform from a rock to a psychedelic flower.\u201d You just don\u2019t get voice-over like that in Kansas City!\n\nThis new location should raise some interesting cultural questions. How will, say, Karamo school a Tokyo resident on their own culture? How will Antoni explain uni? Most importantly, what on earth are the Fab Five gonna do without their signature, massive Uber XL? We only pray for a shot of them riding a four-seat tandem bicycle, with Tan in the basket like Toto. Some of these concerns are alleviated by the season\u2019s two special guest guides, model and actress Kiko Mizuhara and comedian Naomi Watanabe. Based on the trailer, the seven look like they have a supercute rapport.\n\nNetflix will drop all four episodes of this on November 1, in a move that feels like it\u2019s pulling out its signature-series big guns in direct response to Apple TV+, which launches the same day. If Dickinson is too steamy a watch, or if the pure emotion of seeing Jennifer Aniston in a leading role again is too much to bear, Queer Eye: We\u2019re in Japan! looks like it will be a nice, light bit of counterprogramming. We know they\u2019ll do Bruley proud.", "description": "On November 1, Netflix will release its four-episode \u201cspecial season\u201d of \u201cQueer Eye,\u201d titled \u201cQueer Eye: We\u2019re in Japan!\u201d Jonathan Van Ness, Tan France, Karamo Brown, Bobby Berk, and Antoni Porowski will be joined by Naomi Watanabe and Kiko Mizuhara.", "authors": ["Rebecca Alter"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/07/07-queer-eye-japan.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
