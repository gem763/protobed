Lawmakers have until October 24 to do so. Obrador\u2019s MORENA party controls both chambers of Congress so legislation is likely to pass.\n\n\n\nCritics say drug cartels would just move on to trafficking other drugs such as crystal meth and fentanyl or move to non drug-related crimes like human smuggling and fuel theft.\n\n\n\nSo will legalising pot put an end to Mexico\u2019s violent drug cartels? We will debate that question with our panel on this episode of The Stream.\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nMexico just took a big step toward marijuana legalisation - Vox\n\nMexico set to fully legalise cannabis in days - The Independent\n\nHere's what's behind Mexico's radical move toward legalising marijuana during its war on drugs - Los Angeles Times\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?
