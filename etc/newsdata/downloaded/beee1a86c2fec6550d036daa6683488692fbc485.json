Another 120 are expected to arrive next month in the tiny central African nation.\n\nThe group in the transit center includes single mothers, unaccompanied children and families from Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia. They have been given asylum-seeker status while the agency determines whether they are refugees.\n\nRwanda, which at one time in 1994 had over 2 million of its citizens displaced after a genocide, signed a deal with UNHCR in September that is meant to help resettle people detained while trying to reach Europe.\n\nVillechalane of UNHCR said that around 3,000 migrants are still thought to be in detention in Libya, where authorities are trying to close the route across the Mediterranean Sea that has seen thousands of people perish trying to reach Europe.\n\nShe called on other countries to follow Rwanda\u2019s example.\n\nMigrants interviewed by Reuters spoke of being detained in underground cells in Libya, having survived attempts to cross the Mediterranean that were thwarted when their boats were intercepted by coast guards and sent back to North Africa.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\n\u201cRwanda is not like Libya but all of us need another step,\u201d said 18-year-old Abdullah Rodwan, from the war-torn Darfur region of Sudan. He fled Sudan in 2016 with a group of 300 young men. Many died, either in the desert or at sea, he said.\n\nRodwan arrived by U.N.-chartered plane two weeks ago and said he was anxious for word on where he might be resettled.\n\n\u201cI hear people say that we might get a chance to live in Africa but, you know, Africa today is good but tomorrow it can easily be bad. That\u2019s why we need a better life somewhere else.\u201d", "description": "At the United Nations emergency transit center next to a serene lake south of Rwanda's capital on Wednesday, the quiet mood was broken by the sobs of a group of female migrants from Ethiopia.", "authors": ["Clement Uwiringiyimana", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444210437&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1S9", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
