The electric Fukuoka, however, faces a race against time to be fit after being injured against South Africa.\n\nMoving out of the pool stage would safeguard rugby\u2019s future in Japan, where public attention will increasing be drawn to next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics.", "description": "Hosts Japan will rely on organised chaos at the Rugby World Cup as they bid to overcome formidable odds and progress to the knockout stage for the first time.", "authors": ["Shinichi Saoshiro", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428240566&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890KI-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
