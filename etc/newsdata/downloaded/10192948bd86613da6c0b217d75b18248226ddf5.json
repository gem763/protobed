To keep up the Mediterranean vibe, use Spanish olives if you can get them, but any olives will do.\n\nThis amount makes a lot of dressing (on purpose, it\u2019s so good!), so I dress the salad with half and serve the other half in a little jug on the table.

Add the salt, then mix and leave to drain in a fine mesh sieve placed over a bowl for five to 10 minutes.\n\nWhen drained, tip the tomatoes into a larger bowl, do not discard the juices. Add the shallots, capers, green olives and parsley and mix well.\n\nPour the reserved tomato juices into the dressing and give a little shake. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Pour half onto the salad and mix well to ensure everything is combined. Pour the rest into a small jug put on the table with the salad for your guests to add more if they like \u2013 and they will!\n\nServe with plenty of crusty bread to mop up the dressing.\n\nFollow Beverley Hicks @littlechelseakitchen", "description": "Summer may officially be over, but you can bring a little sunshine back onto your plates with this beautifully bright tomato salad, inspired by the flavours of Spain.
