Never mind that it was right around where it was expected to be. A glimpse at my inbox tells me that the focus is on the fact that hiring is slowing, another piece of information that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to anyone that\u2019s been paying attention. We already know that 2019\u2019s economy isn\u2019t 2018\u2019s.\n\nNo doubt that yesterday\u2019s ISM manufacturing survey was bad, though it really shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise. The numbers had been dropping, and economists had predicted a decline, though not one as large as it actually was. Really, it only told us what we already knew.\n\nAnd it might not be as worrisome as it looks. We also note here that a reading below 50 is a sign that activity is slowing. But recession? Not always. Yardeni Research\u2019s Ed Yardeni notes that the manufacturing index fell below 50 in 2016, but an economic slowdown didn\u2019t occur. And the latest reading, as bad as it was doesn\u2019t signal a recession either, Yardeni writes. He quotes from the Institute for Supply Management:\n\n\n\n[The] September PMI indicates growth for the 125th consecutive month in the overall economy, and the second month of contraction following 35 straight months of growth in the manufacturing sector. \u201cThe past relationship between the PMI. and the overall economy indicates that the PMI. for September (47.8 percent) corresponds to a 1.5-percent increase in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis,\u201d says [ISM Chair Timothy] Fiore.\n\nIs the possible impeachment of President Donald Trump feeding the market pessimism? It is hard to tell, but Citigroup\u2019s Tobias Levkovich doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cIn many respects, the equity market\u2019s weakness around an ISM manufacturing report below 50 has had more impact than the launch of an inquiry over President Trump\u2019s Ukrainian dealings,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt may reflect consistent recession worries but also the sense that getting the two-thirds conviction needed in the Senate is unlikely should the House vote pass with a simple majority.\u201d\n\nSo we\u2019re going to take a moment to not panic, and wait and see how things play out.\n\nMarkets Now is a quick take on what\u2019s happening with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and other major market indexes.
