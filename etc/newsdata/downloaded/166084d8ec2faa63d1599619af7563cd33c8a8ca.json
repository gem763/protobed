Williams has movement in each of his arms and legs, according to the network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n#Packers RB Jamaal Williams is being evaluated for head & neck injuries. #PHIvsGB \u2014 Green Bay Packers (@packers) September 27, 2019\n\nQuick TD for Packers: Green Bay has the early lead with a touchdown on its first possession of the night. Soon after play resumed following the injury suffered by Jamaal Williams on the Packers\u2019 first offensive play, Aaron Rodgers threw a perfectly placed lob to wide receiver Davante Adams along the right sideline for a 58-yard gain. Aaron Jones finished the drive with a three-yard touchdown run. It\u2019s another quick start for the unbeaten Packers \u2014 and another slow start for the struggling Eagles. (Packers 7, Eagles 0 with 10:31 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nJamaal Williams hurt: Packers running back Jamaal Williams was taken from the field on a stretcher after absorbing a helmet-to-helmet hit on Green Bay\u2019s first offensive play. Williams caught a pass from Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and already was in the process of being tackled when Eagles defensive end Derek Barnett applied the hit to Williams\u2019s helmet. Barnett was penalized for unnecessary roughness but was not ejected from the game, a decision on which the NFL\u2019s officiating department in New York has input. Williams gave a thumbs-up signal with his left hand as he was being taken from the field. (Eagles 0, Packers 0 with 12:49 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nGood start for Green Bay defense: The Packers have been a defense-first team this season. And the Green Bay defense is off to a good start. The Eagles came out running. They began the game\u2019s first possession with two running plays, the second of which brought a 19-yard gain by Jordan Howard. But the Eagles went to the pass from there, with no success. Three straight passes by Carson Wentz yielded two incompletions and a completion for no yards. The Eagles punted, and Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay offense take the field for the first time. (Eagles 0, Packers 0 with 12:49 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s not now-or-never time for the Philadelphia Eagles when they face the Green Bay Packers on Thursday night at Lambeau Field. Not yet. Not with the NFL season only reaching its one-quarter mark.\n\nBut it\u2019s getting close. It could begin to feel relatively late in the season awfully soon for the Eagles if they lose to the unbeaten Packers.\n\nThe Eagles, believed to be a Super Bowl contender in the NFC entering the season, are off to a 1-2 start in which injuries have depleted the supporting cast around quarterback Carson Wentz on offense. With the Dallas Cowboys 3-0 and looking imposing behind the increasingly productive passing of quarterback Dak Prescott, the Eagles must right themselves soon or risk having the Cowboys turn the NFC East race into a runaway.\n\nAD\n\nThe NFL's search for the next Sean McVay has created a new role: Head Coach of the Defense\n\nThe Eagles are yet to have a complete performance this season. Since a season-opening triumph at home over the Washington Redskins, they\u2019ve suffered losses at Atlanta and to the Detroit Lions in Philadelphia. Even in the win over the Redskins, the Eagles trailed by 17-0 in the first half. It\u2019s not what they imagined in the offseason when they permitted Nick Foles, their former Super Bowl MVP, to leave via free agency while doubling down on Wentz as their franchise quarterback with a four-year, $128 million contract extension.\n\nAD\n\nEagles at Packers\n\nWhen: Thursday at 8:20 p.m. Eastern\n\nWhere: Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis.\n\nTV: Fox, NFL Network\n\nStreaming: Amazon Prime Video, Twitch, Yahoo Sports, Fox Sports GO, NFL.com, fuboTV\n\nAD\n\nThe injuries have been particularly debilitating to Wentz\u2019s group of pass-catchers, with wide receivers DeSean Jackson and Alshon Jeffery sidelined. Jeffery is scheduled to return to the lineup Thursday after missing one game (and much of another) because of a calf injury. Jackson is to remain out at least through this game.\n\nThe task for the Eagles is formidable in Green Bay. The Packers (3-0) appear capable of challenging the Los Angeles Rams and Cowboys for NFC supremacy.\n\nSo much of the preseason focus was on the relationship between Matt LaFleur, Green Bay\u2019s new head coach, and quarterback Aaron Rodgers. And while the success of that pairing ultimately could determine whether the Packers remain a viable Super Bowl contender, the Packers\u2019 early-season success has been achieved through an all-around team effort, taking some of the burden off Rodgers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis has been a defense-first team. The Packers are ranked only 28th in the league in total offense and 24th in scoring offense; they\u2019re 24th in rushing offense and 27th in passing offense. So while LaFleur is a would-be offensive genius in the mold of Rams Coach Sean McVay, for whom he worked in L.A. after they were fellow assistants in Washington, his best move thus far was his decision upon being hired to retain defensive coordinator Mike Pettine from predecessor Mike McCarthy\u2019s staff.\n\nThe Packers, after bolstering their defense in free agency during the offseason, are ranked 13th in total defense and second in scoring defense. They\u2019re fifth in pass defense. Their one vulnerability has come in defending the run. They rank 25th in rushing defense. Pass rusher Za\u2019Darius Smith, one of the defense\u2019s several expensive additions in free agency, is listed as questionable Thursday because of a knee injury.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nThe Browns\u2019 slow start and a brutal schedules means they could be in trouble\n\nBest bets for NFL Week 4: Vikings and Jaguars cover thanks to their pass rushes\n\nBaker Mayfield vs. Rex Ryan might be the NFL season\u2019s most fun, unexpected battle\n\nAD", "description": "Philadelphia is off to a 1-2 start, while Green Bay is looking to improve to 4-0.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OhdLJpCn3ccXO4A2wPjU0d4uatM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TEXKDPHAYII6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
