Also, \u201ceach person\u2019s situation is different,\u201d says Mei Ling Nazar, founder of Family Entourage, a website that interviews celebrities about their families. \u201cA stroller that might work for someone that lives in the city may not work for someone who wants to be running every day.\u201d Jennifer LaBracio, gear editor at Babylist, agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s important to really examine where you live, whether it\u2019s the city or suburbs, how you\u2019re going to use the stroller, and how much you want to spend.\u201d\n\nBut with hundreds of models on the market, there is a way to make the search a little less daunting. \u201cStart by choosing your car seat, and then find the stroller that goes with it instead of the other way around,\u201d says Saxton. \u201cI don\u2019t recommend trying to mix and match. Just find a travel system that\u2019s the same brand. It\u2019s just too many steps.\u201d She has one other piece of advice: \u201cNo matter what, just get it in black. I own a cleaning company, trust me, over time all of the spills and stains are going to add up even if you do clean it regularly, and black is going to be the best to hide that. It\u2019ll just give you more longevity.\u201d\n\nTo help you choose your baby\u2019s first ride, we consulted experts including Sexton, Nazar, and LaBracio, as well as nanny agencies, mommy bloggers, and gear heads for their thoughts on the best strollers in just about every category you can think of, from everyday strollers to double strollers to jogging strollers to travel strollers to new direct-to-consumer entrants and even a nifty wagon stroller. Below, 19 picks for every parent and caregiver.\n\nBest overall stroller\n\nUppababy Vista Hands down, the most recommended stroller among our experts was the Uppababy Vista, an adaptable, grow-with-your-family stroller that comes chock full of features and can accommodate up to three children with the proper accessories and adapters (sold separately). It comes with a bassinet, so \u201cit works from day one with an infant,\u201d according to LaBracio, and its mattress is aerated, so parents can have peace of mind when their baby is sleeping in it. Motherly co-founders Liz Tenety and Jill Koziol love the Vista \u201cbecause it allows you to have three kids (kickboard and two seats) at the same time without adding width to the stroller.\u201d They also appreciate the option of using it with kids of different ages (in the bassinet, the seat, and kickboard, which is sold separately), or kids of the same age (in two bassinets or two seats). Other features that our experts love about the Vista include the huge sun canopy and one of the biggest storage underbaskets on the market. \u201cThe basket is HUGE,\u201d says Natasha K., a nanny in the New York City-based child care network SmartSitting. \u201cIt easily fits three Trader Joe\u2019s paper shopping bag-fulls of groceries. It really is a beast.\u201d Others like how maneuverable, smooth, and easy to push the Vista is. SmartSitter Tracy-Lee N. adds that she likes \u201chow easy it is to change the seat to a reclining position; how comfortable the seat appears to be for the child, and solid too, so that the child\u2019s back is supported; the stroller never changes direction by itself when one is pushing it along, making it feel safe.\u201d SmartSitter Meghan D. also likes its maneuverability and says, \u201cI find this to be the most popular stroller among the families I nanny for.\u201d As SmartSitter Michaniya C. puts it: \u201cOnce you take it through the streets of New York City in deep snow, you won\u2019t buy any other stroller.\u201d Jessica Rockowitz, founder of Every Mama Birth Education calls the Vista \u201ca stroller that does it all.\u201d But some of our experts caution that it\u2019s not going to work for everyone, as it\u2019s a large and heavy stroller that isn\u2019t the most convenient for constantly putting in and taking out of a car trunk, for example. And the cost is prohibitive for a lot of people. But if you are planning on having more than one child, the Vista is one of the best tandem-style (not side-by-side), expandable strollers on the market. Plus, as both Saxton and LaBracio pointed out, Uppababy has phenomenal customer service. City dwellers might want to consider the Uppababy Cruz instead, which offers the best of the Vista (durability, smooth ride, great sun canopy and under storage, but only accommodates one child at a time) but on a lighter, smaller frame that folds a little easier. Like the Vista, you can attach a bassinet or infant car seat to it. From $900 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nBest less-expensive Vista dupe\n\nMockingbird Stroller For parents who like everything about the Uppababy Vista but can\u2019t stomach the nearly $1,000 price tag, there\u2019s Mockingbird, a new direct-to-consumer stroller brand that launched earlier this year, which, according to Saxton is \u201cjust exploding in popularity,\u201d in part due to how much it has in common with the Uppababy Vista. Except it\u2019s a third of the price. LaBracio agrees the Mockingbird is a worthy Vista dupe: \u201cIt looks just like the Vista. It\u2019s just cheaper. It has pretty much the same features,\u201d including a reversible, reclining seat, large UPF sunshade, and storage basket. Although it doesn\u2019t come with a bassinet, you can purchase one separately. But it is single-seat only, so it doesn\u2019t come with the expandability that the Vista is known for. $350 at Mockingbird Buy\n\nBest everyday stroller\n\nBaby Jogger City Mini GT For an affordable, everyday stroller, four of our experts recommend the Baby Jogger City Mini GT stroller. \u201cIt\u2019s a great all-around stroller at an affordable price point, and has a lot of features that some of the higher-end, much more costly strollers have,\u201d says LaBracio. One of the biggest draws of the stroller is the true one-handed fold. \u201cA lot of strollers say they are a one-handed fold stroller, but this is actually one-handed. It works. It\u2019s easy and quick and doesn\u2019t take 20 times to figure out.\u201d Other features include an adjustable handlebar, all-terrain wheels, storage basket, and a nearly flat recline, which LaBracio notes is \u201chuge\u201d if you\u2019re on the go and want your baby to nap. She notes that it\u2019s also compatible with a lot of infant car seats. \u201cConsidering price and overall features, I say this is probably the best. It\u2019s not $900, but it\u2019s also not $100. It\u2019s well-made and holds up really well,\u201d she says. She also notes that the City Mini GT works just as well in the suburbs. \u201cIt has the easy fold for a suburban person, but for a city person, it still has the durability that you need to walk on the city streets day in and day out.\u201d Anna Stanin, the owner and founder of Sudsy Buggy, agrees that the City Mini is \u201cgood for urban and suburban riding,\u201d making it her \u201cgo-to\u201d pick. \u201cIt handles beautifully on rough New York streets,\u201d she adds. The Nanny League\u2019s Nicole Redmond also recommends the City Mini GT as her overall favorite stroller: \u201cThe push is lightweight and it glides smoothly. I am able to push with one hand and use my other to either hold another child\u2019s hand or walk the dog. The fold is nice and easy as well. The size is quite compact, too, which allows for more trunk space.\u201d Saxton also recommends it as her budget pick. $360 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) everyday stroller\n\nErgobaby 180 Reversible Stroller Another solid, slightly less expensive option for an everyday stroller is the Ergobaby 180, which came recommended by Allyson Downey, the CEO of Stellar Reviews and weeSpring. A hybrid between a lightweight umbrella stroller and a full-size, Downey suggests it for \u201csomeone who considers themselves a product minimalist, or the Manhattan mom who doesn\u2019t want three strollers.\u201d It has a one-handed fold and the ability to switch the handlebar position to have the baby sitting either inward or outward facing. She notes that it\u2019s city-ready and has great maneuverability. $300 at Target Buy\n\nBest travel stroller\n\nThe Baby Zen Yoyo+, a lightweight and compact travel stroller, was the second-most recommended stroller by our experts. (Along with the Uppababy Vista, it\u2019s all over Brooklyn, too.) \u201cThis one is the best for families who travel frequently,\u201d says LaBracio. \u201cIt can also work as your everyday city stroller, [especially] for people who live in walk-ups, because it folds so compactly, and you can just toss it over your shoulder.\u201d It weighs in at around 14 pounds, depending on the version, and it has a true one-handed fold and unfold capability that Labracio says is a \u201chuge feature,\u201d adding that \u201cit seems like maybe it wouldn\u2019t be, but when you\u2019re trying to hold the baby with one hand and trying to get up your apartment stairs, or trying to board a plane or train, it\u2019s so great to be able to just fold it down with one hand.\u201d It\u2019s also \u201csuper compact and fits in overhead bins, fits under the table at a restaurant, fits on a train overhead compartment.\u201d It also \u201csteers easily and can be pushed with one hand, which is another plus.\u201d Koziol and Tenety also recommend the Yoyo for travel and city parents, noting that \u201cit folds to roughly the size of a gym bag, so it boasts an incredibly small footprint.\u201d SmartSitter Natasha K. agrees, calling it the \u201cbest lightweight and travel-friendly stroller.\u201d She also likes that it is very smooth and easy to turn: \u201cI can open a door and turn it with one hand.\u201d Another SmartSitter, Chloe L., says that it\u2019s \u201ceasy to operate through New York City sidewalks and the subway. It\u2019s also really easy to carry up the stairs if a family is in a walk-up building. When our job is to keep kids safe while navigating the city, strollers like the Babyzen Yoyo make the ease of lifting children over steps on our own much easier.\u201d The Yoyo is available in newborn and toddler options, and also accommodates a rolling-board attachment for an older child to sit or stand on. \u201cThis is one of our best-selling strollers for our customers,\u201d says Yossi Rapoport, owner of Lullaby Baby Park Slope.\n\nAnother travel stroller\n\nUppababy Minu Stroller The Uppababy Minu is a good option if you\u2019re looking for a compact, lightweight stroller that is a little more robust than the Babyzen Yoyo+. It\u2019s one of Saxton\u2019s three strollers that she owns, and she says that \u201cit is a great option for a compact stroller that still has bigger stroller features like bigger storage and a better sunshade.\u201d SmartSitter Michaniya C. agrees, saying that the Minu offers one of the best values when it comes to strollers. \u201cIt\u2019s about a third of the cost of the Vista, and it has accessories to accommodate a child from birth. Take good care of it and you can use it through the toddler age. It\u2019s also great for travel.\u201d Strategist editor Alexis Swerdloff can also vouch for it after taking it on a trip to Paris with her baby: \u201cThe thing folds incredibly easily (truly with one hand), it\u2019s really lightweight (lugging it up the three flights of stairs to our Airbnb was no problem), and substantive enough to handle wobbly, cobblestoned side streets of Paris as well as bumpy Brooklyn sidewalks.\u201d $430 at Amazon Buy From $400 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nBest jogging stroller\n\nBob Revolution Flex 3.0 Jogging Stroller If you want to take your child with you on runs, the Bob Revolution is the standout jogging stroller among our experts. \u201cBob will unquestionably be the consensus pick in that category, as it\u2019s really the Cadillac of jogging strollers,\u201d says Saxton (she owns three different strollers; the Bob is one of them). She says it\u2019s really comfortable for the baby, and it has a huge sunshade as well as a peekaboo window. But the most attractive feature is its suspension system. \u201cIt\u2019s got huge wheels, and the ride is really smooth. You can go over a curb with no problem in this stroller. It has great suspension, and it also has multiple modes.\u201d A swivel-locking front wheel makes it easy to maneuver and stable when jogging with it. There\u2019s also a tracking adjustment knob that helps keep the stroller aligned, a feature that LaBracio particularly likes. She also points out that the Flex model has an adjustable handlebar that offers nine different positions, noting that \u201cif you\u2019re going to invest in a jogging stroller, odds are you\u2019re going to want as many people using it as possible.\u201d Our experts also mentioned how sturdy and durable it is. \u201cYou see these on the secondhand market still going for nearly full price because they just last so long,\u201d says Saxton. Because the ride is so smooth on the Bob, some families like to use it as their everyday stroller, or for outings to the zoo, for example. SmartSitting\u2019s co-owner and director of operations Suzie Zeldin Russell says that while the Bob is not a compact stroller (it\u2019s also not very convenient to load into a car trunk), she likes it because \u201cthe bigger wheels and smooth ride make it so much easier to use and much less jolting for our son.\u201d She notes that her husband is a runner, and their son \u201chappens to be just as comfortable out for a walk as he is on an 8-mile run in the stroller.\u201d While they own other strollers that they use for different occasions, their \u201call-around winner is definitely the Bob.\u201d From $450 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nAnother jogging stroller\n\nThule Urban Glide 2 Jogging Stroller Thule\u2019s Urban Glide 2 is another highly recommended jogging stroller that some people even say offers a smoother ride than the Bob. \u201cIt really does glide across the pavement, and the baby seems to never notice the bumps in the road,\u201d says Amanda Fellner, head teacher at Rita Gold Early Childhood Center. \u201cThe standout on this one is it\u2019s handlebar twist break,\u201d says LaBracio. \u201cWhen you\u2019re running down a hill, you can twist it and make it easier to keep the stroller in control. It slows it down for you and you don\u2019t have to do that with your own body weight, making it easier and safer to go down a hill.\u201d According to the Nanny League, the Urban Glide\u2019s \u201clarge wheels make it great for all types of terrains.\u201d They also note that it\u2019s lightweight for a jogging stroller (it weighs 25.3 pounds, making it 3.2 pounds lighter than the Bob) and \u201cdoesn\u2019t add a lot of extra weight to the runner\u2019s push.\u201d Nazar, who has used both the Bob and Thule, says that she was impressed with the latter\u2019s braking system and the way that it folds down. From $480 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nBest double stroller\n\nBaby Jogger City Mini GT Double If you\u2019re looking for a double stroller, the Baby Jogger City Mini GT Double stroller is a good, less expensive option for the Uppababy Vista. This one is side-by-side (whereas the Vista is a tandem with stacked seats, keeping the stroller profile narrow). LaBracio likes it because it has all the features of the single City Mini GT but can accommodate two children at once. She notes that a side-by-side is easier to push and maneuver, especially in a city where you have to go up and down curbs. And parents like the fact that kids can interact with each other when they\u2019re sitting next to each other. Of course, doorways can be a little tricky, but double strollers are designed to fit through at least commercial doorways, though it\u2019s not a bad idea to measure the doorways you know you\u2019ll be going in and out of on a daily basis. Redmond and newborn-care specialist Julia Mitchell also recommend the City Mini GT, saying that it\u2019s \u201ceasy to push, light weight, and easy to fold.\u201d $580 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nBest luxury stroller\n\nBugaboo Cameleon3 Plus If you\u2019re looking for the most luxurious ride for your little one, consider the Bugaboo Cameleon3 Plus stroller, which was recommended by four of our experts. \u201cI think Bugaboo was the first to really enter this whole luxury-stroller market, so they\u2019re sort of the OG when it comes to fancy strollers,\u201d says LaBracio. \u201cPeople love them, and for good reason. They have really big tires and a ton of features and accessories. They steer really well and easily, and you can do a lot of customizing with the fabric, which is really cool and fun. It\u2019s just a really pretty stroller that\u2019s well made.\u201d Saxton is also \u201cpartial to the classic, which is the Bugaboo Cameleon,\u201d and Mitchell agrees, saying that \u201cit looks great and is one of the best strollers I\u2019ve ever used.\u201d SmartSitter Meghan D. loves that on the Cameleon, \u201cyou can very easily switch the handle to have the baby facing front or facing back towards you. I love this option because it allows the baby time to explore the scenery around or relax and nap facing the opposite direction.\u201d $880 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nBest stroller for newborns and infants\n\nDoona Infant Car Seat/Stroller The Doona is a car seat and stroller in one system, and it\u2019s Saxton\u2019s number-one recommendation. \u201cIt is a car seat with wheels and I couldn\u2019t stop using it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is so convenient. Literally you just lift it out of your car, and you don\u2019t even have to set it on the ground. The wheels just release and then it lands as a stroller.\u201d Mitchell agrees: \u201cThe Doona is the easiest stroller to travel with as a newborn care specialist.\u201d As does Tenety, who loves it for its \u201ceasy in-and-out of cars and trains\u201d and the fact that \u201cit truly collapses down from a stroller to infant car seat, and back again, with ease.\u201d She adds that she finds it particularly helpful as a mom with several young children. \u201cHaving only one piece to set up reduces the amount of time I spend getting kids in and out of cars, and that\u2019s particularly helpful in dangerous parking lots,\u201d Tenety says. Saxton notes that it\u2019s not a long-term stroller option, however, as its weight limit goes up to 35 pounds. The Doona was also Strategist freelance editor Jessica Silvester\u2019s choice when her baby was young. She says that because of its size, \u201cyou can push it with one arm, take sharp turns, lower the handlebar to make it even more compact, and park it next to you in a Cobble Hill restaurant where the Uppababy would never fit. Never has it been easier to get a newborn into an Uber.\u201d $500 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nBest compact stroller\n\nGB Pockit Plus Saxton\u2019s third stroller is the GB Pockit Plus, and it is truly tiny. \u201cThis thing is so small it would fit in a backpack the way it folds up. It\u2019s great,\u201d she says. It weighs 9.5 pounds and is the 2014 Guinness World Record holder for most compact stroller. According to the company, it is the smallest and most compact stroller on the market (when folded up), measuring 11.8 by 7 by 13.8 inches. The Nanny League also recommends it as their choice for best compact and most travel-friendly stroller, as it can easily fit in an overhead bin. $180 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nBest umbrella stroller\n\nUppababy G-Luxe If you\u2019re looking for a true umbrella stroller (one that folds into a stick, like a long umbrella), consider the Uppababy G-Luxe, which LaBracio recommends. Although it\u2019s on the higher end price-point wise, it offers a \u201cmore stable and more durable frame and a smoother ride\u201d than very inexpensive ones. She notes that it has a great recline and an adjustable footrest, \u201cwhich is really nice because some babies find it hard to nap with their legs dangling.\u201d She adds that its undercarriage storage is nice, and that the stroller can be pushed by taller people. Another key feature is that it stands on its own when folded up. Lindsay Aspell Thomason, founder of the Nanny League, also likes the G-Luxe. \u201cIt\u2019s lightweight and has great maneuverability. The super comfy seat also reclines (almost) completely flat, which is great for infants (3 months to preschool years). It has amazing UV protection with a sunshade built in for extra protection. Plus, it\u2019s easy to fold and carry around.\u201d From $280 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nBest royal-approved stroller\n\nBugaboo Fox Stroller According to British tabloid the Mirror, Meghan Markle is using the Bugaboo Fox for little Archie. It was reportedly gifted to Markle and Prince Harry by a close friend. Motherly\u2019s Tenety and Koziol approve of it, too, calling it their favorite luxury stroller: \u201cIt\u2019s made of sustainable materials, features fashionable textiles, and has an easy, effective fold.\u201d $1,200 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nAnother royal-approved stroller\n\nSilver Cross Balmoral Pram If you\u2019re obsessed with the British Royal Family and have some money to burn, then what you want is the Silver Cross Balmoral Pram. The elegant style is what Prince William and Princess Kate (and other royals before them) use for their progeny, and it\u2019s considered the \u201cRolls-Royce of Prams.\u201d It\u2019s highly impractical unless you have your own carriage handler (can you imagine lugging that thing in and out of your apartment?), but there\u2019s no denying how gorgeous it is \u2014 even if it looks a bit ridiculous. The Silver Cross recently came to the States with a more everyday line that still has the brand\u2019s aesthetic, which includes strollers like the Wave, a model that Victoria, a nanny with the Pavillion Agency, recommends for its comfort, longevity, and contemporary aesthetic. \u201cI\u2019ve been a nanny for ten years, and I live and die by my strollers. The main thing for me is comfort and longevity, but the parents I work with like contemporary strollers and the style is important. The Silver Cross Wave is one of the best; it\u2019s amazing. All of the accessories are included, so you don\u2019t need to get anything else. It\u2019s very high-end.\u201d $3,500 at Strolleria Buy\n\nBest wagon stroller\n\nEvenflo Pivot X-Plore All Terrain Stroller Wagon The stroller wagon is, according to Saxton, a \u201chot, new up-and-coming category\u201d of stroller that replaces the traditional Radio Flyer wagon. She particularly likes Evenflo\u2019s Pivot X-Plore All Terrain Stroller Wagon. \u201cThis thing is awesome. It\u2019s got two sunshades so you can have two kids facing each other. You could use it for a single kid or as a double stroller. I just think these are really fun for a trip to the farmers market, or if you\u2019re going to the fair for the day. I think kids think it\u2019s fun.\u201d $350 at Target Buy\n\nTwo other strollers of note\n\nColugo Compact Stroller Another DTC option that\u2019s been making the Instagram rounds lately is the Colugo, which LaBracio categorizes as \u201ca lightweight travel stroller that\u2019s bigger than an umbrella stroller but smaller than a full-size.\u201d It weighs 16 pounds and folds down easily and comes in a bunch of on-trend fabric choices, like the leopard print that was sold out for a while, until recently. This writer was given one to try out and can attest to how easy it is to fold and unfold, its smooth ride, and its portability (it comes with a strap so you can just throw it over your shoulder). Serena Williams loves the Colugo, too (she\u2019s an investor). $285 at Colugo Buy\n\nLarktale Chit Chat Stroller Another new stroller company we heard about is Larktale. It was started by \u201cstroller-industry veterans,\u201d according to Saxton, who says the Chit Chat, which weighs just 14.5 pounds, is \u201creally cool.\u201d $200 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
