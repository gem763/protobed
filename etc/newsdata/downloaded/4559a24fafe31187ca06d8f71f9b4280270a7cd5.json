NBC still fired Lauer less than 24 hours later for sexual misconduct in the workplace, carrying on an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate at the company.\n\nSEE ALSO: Matt Lauer's ex-wife Annette Roque speaks out for the first time in 2 years\n\nLast month, Vieira called Lauer's firing \"like a gut punch\" in an interview with People.\n\n\"I was [in L.A.] and my phone started going off at 4 a.m.,\" she explained. \"I didn't know what to make of all of it. It was a shock.\"\n\n\"Matt and I were very close,\" she went on. \"He was very kind to me. We both have similar senses of humor. We're both sarcastic.\"\n\nFor his part, Lauer has vehemently denied that he raped Nevils. In an open letter published this week, the disgraced television personality called their relationship \"extramarital, but consensual.\"", "description": "Former 'Today' show co-anchors Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira's relationship was permanently affected by his firing.", "authors": ["Gibson Johns"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WglKgE1hSYC7LSSFU7rZ7w--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/2563x1680+214+215/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/f9da80e0-ec56-11e9-87ef-eeda694dfac8", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
