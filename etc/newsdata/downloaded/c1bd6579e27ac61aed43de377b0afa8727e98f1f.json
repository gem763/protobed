Devin Nunes (R-CA) maintained Republicans were able to prove there was no quid pro quo in President Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during Bill Taylor Jr.'s deposition on Tuesday.\n\nNunes, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, told Fox News host Sean Hannity Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX) was able to \"destroy\" Taylor's assertion that military aid was withheld until Ukraine publicly declared they will investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, over allegations of corruption.\n\n\"Well, I was down there most of the day in this meeting with Ambassador Taylor. And once again, it was the same thing, something leaks out to The Washington Post, narratives are built. But the truth is, is that in two minutes, John Ratcliffe destroyed this witness. There is no quid pro quo,\" Nunes said.\n\n\"In addition, it continues to be alarming to me the lack of the understanding at the State Department by the bureaucracy there about how much the Ukrainians were involved opposing Donald Trump as a candidate,\" he said.\n\nNunes said he wants to make sure the audio recordings of the witnesses are not deleted.\n\n\"Tradition that has Republicans and Democrats get the tapes and then get the \u2014 get the transcripts. Being that [Democrats] are not giving us the transcripts for fear \u2014 which you know, they say fear of leaking, I mean, are you kidding me? These guys are the king of leaks. It\u2019s absolutely incredible. The leaks come out all day long every day to the all the mainstream media,\" he continued.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Taylor said \"he was told release of military aid was contingent on public declarations from Ukraine that it would investigate the Bidens and the 2016 election.\"\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/23/2019 12:34:04PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads", "Guy Benson", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/296/467efb18-fc68-44f8-85c5-c82a1f81cfc0.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
