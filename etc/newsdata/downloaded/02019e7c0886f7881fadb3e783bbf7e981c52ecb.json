Pictured: Daniel in a recent production of Le Corsiare at the Lithuanian National Ballet\n\nBut Dolan said there is one crucial difference \u2013 where Billy's father opposed him doing ballet, both of his parents supported him.\n\nAged four, he was already playing football and rugby but on Saturdays he was dragged along to his older sister Amy's ballet classes in Liverpool.\n\nThen one week, dressed in football kit, he was invited by the teacher to have a go, igniting his love for ballet.\n\nHe was the only boy in the Saturday class at the Elliott Clarke School of Dancing before going on to win a scholarship, aged 11, to the Hammond dance school in Chester, Cheshire.\n\nDaniel was often dragged to his sister's ballet classes in Liverpool where he eventually enrolled. He was the only boy in the Saturday class at the Elliott Clarke School of Dancing\n\nNow 26-year-old recently fulfilled his lifelong ambition to become a top-level lead soloist. Pictured: Daniel as a young boy with sister Amy\n\nAged 16, he won a place at the Bolshoi academy and became the second British boy in the prestigious school's 246-year history to graduate there.\n\nTen years on, the now 26-year-old recently fulfilled his lifelong ambition to become a top-level lead soloist when he took to the stage in the Lithuanian National Ballet's production of Cipollino.\n\nHis mother Carol, 55 made the trip to Vilnius as it was her first chance to see him dance as a soloist. 'It was a big moment for me,' he said.\n\nDaniel recalled his time at the Bolshoi academy as being 'quite painful' and said he had to train up to 12 hours a day, six days a week\n\nMrs Dolan, who admits she is 'not a massive ballet fan', said yesterday: 'He's inspirational. We're really proud.'\n\nDolan, whose father Peter, 58, is a salesman and rugby coach, said: 'People think that coming from a town like Widnes I might have had a hard time \u2013 you are supposed to get a regular job or play rugby.\n\n'But every time I go back home I'm mobbed in the pub by people asking me about my dancing \u2013 the support I've had is amazing.'\n\nMrs Dolan, 55, a customer assistant for NatWest, added: 'Dan was very athletic as a child.\n\n'He didn't really get any stick from his mates because he was one of the lads, playing football. But he got a lot of fun out of dancing and stuck with it.'\n\nDolan recalled his time at the Bolshoi as being 'quite painful', training up to 12 hours a day, six days a week, but said he enjoyed the discipline.\n\nHe had to learn Russian \u2013 and, like all schoolchildren in the country, how to strip a rifle and put on a gas mask.\n\nHe joined the Lithuanian National Ballet soon after graduating.", "description": "Daniel Dolan from Widnes, Cheshire, had his heart set on ballet from a young age and won a prestigious\u00a0place at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow at age 16.", "authors": ["Liz Hull For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/20/19604008-0-image-a-31_1570821367296.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
