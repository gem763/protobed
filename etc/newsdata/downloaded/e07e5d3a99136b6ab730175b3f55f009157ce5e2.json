Trump\u2019s ability to navigate the difficult moral and military choices in the region, new players are entering the picture in and around the Persian Gulf.\n\nCan Trump Lie His Way Out of War With Iran? Yep. That\u2019s What He\u2019s Been Doing.\n\nAn Israeli delegation attended a U.S.-backed maritime security conference that began Sunday in Manama with delegations from Saudi Arabia and Bahrain as a vast international maritime exercise, IMX 19, got under way in the Persian Gulf. Planning involved as many as 22 countries.\n\nThe exercise is an annual affair that began in 2012 under the Obama administration, but took on a different coloration after the Iranian-backed attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s main oil processing facility on September 14. When Trump and the Saudis backed away from direct military retaliation, military exercises took on heightened significancce. Vice Admiral Jim Malloy, commander of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command declared on a visit to Riyadh September 29 that, \u201cEngaging and operating closely with regional counterparts is essential to maintain deterrence.\u201d\n\nBut at this moment when U.S. policy in the Middle East appears to be in growing disarray, the question emerges who will be the guarantor of security for the vast quantities of hydrocarbons produced and shipped from the region? And there are now ample signals that Russia wants to step into a role as part of its expanding influence in the region.\n\nOne of the clearest indicators came last month when Iran\u2014yes, Iran\u2014announced through its official media that it would soon participate in joint naval exercises with Russia and China. Yes, China.\n\nThose reports came soon after the United States, in the aftermath of the attacks on Saudi Arabia, said it would be sending a few hundred American troops to bolster the kingdom\u2019s defenses. That augmentation has since been increased to 3,000 U.S. troops. But the Iranian announcement was not merely reactive and should not have come as a surprise, at least where the Russian-Iranian connection was concerned.\n\nAlready at the end of July, according to Jane\u2019s Navy International, Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi, commander of the Iranian Navy, and Russian Navy chief Admiral Nikolai Anatolevich Evemenov \u201csigned a memorandum of understanding\u201d to \u201cexpand bilateral ties.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of this month, Moscow confirmed preparations for a joint naval exercise with China and Iran in the Indian Ocean. At the Valdai Discussion Club held from September 30 until October 3 in Sochi, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said flatly, \"We, the People's Republic of China and Iran are preparing naval drills for fighting terrorists and pirates in this part of the Indian Ocean.\"\n\nThe limited scope reflected China\u2019s caution. Analysts told the South China Morning Post in September, just after the Iranian announcement, that Beijing probably would not send anything more than a few ships from its anti-piracy squadron, which has been in place off the coast of Somalia for years. The last thing it wants is to get caught between Washington and Tehran.\n\nBut as military analyst Song Zhongping told the Morning Post, the Chinese \u201cescort fleet\u201d off the African coast is looking to extend its reach into the northern Indian Ocean and the Strait of Hormuz, waterways \u201cimportant to China\u2019s oil lifeline in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nSo, is the planned joint exercise part of a 'preemptive defense' strategy against a possible U.S attack on Iran? Although the message is carefully calibrated, even discussion of such exercises is a show of support for Tehran at a time when Iran is reeling under the U.S policy of 'maximum pressure' pushing it toward economic isolation worldwide.\n\nThe planned joint exercise does not guarantee Beijing and Moscow would side with Tehran if Iran is attacked by the U.S. or Israel, but at a minimum it suggests that possibility. Iran wants to show that it may be isolated economically but not politically or militarily. And China and Russia want to show their solidarity while taking, for the moment, minimum risks.", "description": "Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily BeastKARACHI, Pakistan\u2014The waters around the Arabian Peninsula have calmed for the moment, but preparations combat continue, with joint exercises and security conferences showing just how profoundly the region\u2019s strategic balances are shifting.As confidence", "authors": ["Syed Fazl-E-Haider"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uVE1PVBrLvuly52e9T71HQ--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/47b7003df72500259caaf2da09730b5a", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
