Put it this way: I\u2019m thinking of voting for him next year now.\n\nThe dog, I mean. Not Trump.\n\nNo, really, though, if he replaces Pence on the ticket with the dog, I think he wins 400 electoral votes. And if he ends up getting impeached and removed in his second term, hey \u2014 at least we\u2019ll finally have a veteran as president again.\n\nWe have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi! pic.twitter.com/PDMx9nZWvw \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 28, 2019\n\nThe only way the photo could be better would be if, against all odds, he was a chonky boi instead of a sleek killing machine.\n\nWord on the street is that his name is Conan. Another Conan once famously said that the best experience in life is \u201cto crush your enemies, to see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women.\u201d\n\nConan the dog actually did that two days ago, bro.\n\nI like to imagine the photo was taken 10 minutes after the raid, in fact. He looks happy because he just got done burying Baghdadi\u2019s femur.\n\nA few obvious things will happen now. One: There will be a movie made about a dog who hunts terrorists and it\u2019ll gross like $700 million. Stephen \u201credsteeze\u201d Miller is probably right that it\u2019ll be called \u201cZero Bark Thirty,\u201d although \u201cA Few Good Bois\u201d is also inspired. Two: Trump will try to leverage public interest in the dog, maybe by holding a ceremony where he awards the dog the Purple Heart, maybe by trying to arrange to have the dog brought to one of his rallies. maybe both. That will be a cynical attempt to exploit the popularity of a military service animal for his own electoral ends.\n\nBut it\u2019ll also sort of rule. If he\u2019s gonna abuse his power as president to serve his own personal political interests, better this than leaning on the Ukrainians.\n\nPresumably reporters are right now combing through the dog\u2019s Twitter archives, looking for something un-woke that can be used to spoil his big moment. Exit question: What if Conan is ultimately revealed to be a Never Trumper? In that case, Trump will tweet that the dog is highly overrated and actually contributed nothing to the Baghdadi raid.\n\nUpdate: Here we go!", "description": "Oh yes.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/c-5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
