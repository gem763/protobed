If the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d it\u2019s time to consider couples therapy.\n\nCounseling may seem like a waste of effort when things are going smoothly, but therapists around the country say it\u2019s always a good time to stop in; you don\u2019t need a huge problem to be the catalyst. (A strong case can even be made for going to a marriage therapist on your own, believe it or not.)\n\nBelow, therapists share six reasons why therapy works wonders for even the healthiest, happy couples.\n\nTherapy keeps you healthier as a couple, physically and mentally.\n\n\u201cMaintenance of a happy, deeply connected relationship is just as important for your health as a consistent workout regime. Research indicates that unhappily married couples experience more health problems overall. The flip side of this is true for couples who maintain those loving feelings. In general, happily married people, especially men, are healthier. So next time you throw on your athleisure wear, consider swapping one of your spin classes for couples therapy to keep your health and longevity on the up and up.\u201d \u2015 Laura Heck, a marriage and family therapist in Salt Lake City, Utah\n\nIt can take your relationship from good to great.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a believer that therapy is not just for making dysfunctional relationships good, but for making good relationships great. Smart couples are aware that tension and stress are a normal part of any relationship, and will work toward resilience instead of waiting for problems to erupt and rely on the repair process. I\u2019ve worked with clients who return for a month or two of sessions every time a transition is about to occur in their lives: a job change, a new baby, moving, a dying loved one, etc. They come when they know a change is about to happen so they have a safe environment to discuss their fears, excitement, the logistics, judgments and whatever else they anticipate could emerge with the adjustment. We meet, they voice concerns, we strategize and they feel better equipped for the upcoming changes. It has always worked great for them. \u2015 Ryan Howes, a psychologist in Pasadena, California\n\nIt makes you a more active participant in your relationship.\n\n\u201cThere are many things in our lives that we work at getting better at \u2015 we all have hobbies we enjoy and for many of us our work requires continuing education. Most of us exercise to stay healthy and in shape. But when it comes to relationships, we all want so much out of our partners, but naively expect that it should just come without putting in much effort. If we expect that we\u2019ll need to practice and get the help of an expert in other areas of our life, why don\u2019t we do the same in our love lives too? The rewards for going to therapy as as couple are tremendous \u2015 love, sex, happiness, financial stability, health, the list goes on and on.\u201d \u2015 Kurt Smith, a therapist who counsels men\n\nYou learn how to communicate effectively. \u201cTherapy is great for couples at every stage of the relationship, not just when problems strike \u2015 and is especially good for a relationship in its infancy. Couples who come to therapy are able to sharpen communication skills and give them tools to keep at the ready for when issues arise. Great communication and fewer misunderstandings can nip challenges in the bud and prevent them from spiraling out of control. Couples counseling can also help partners learn new sexual techniques and also help them to get comfortable discussing sex and sexual preferences, something outside of many people\u2019s comfort zones.\u201d \u2015 Laurel Steinberg, a New York-based sexologist and adjunct professor of psychology at Columbia University\n\nIt gives you a safe, open space to address complaints you haven\u2019t voiced to your partner.\n\n\u201cTake a behavior that six months ago was slightly annoying to you, such as your partner forgetting to turn off the lights before leaving the house. At some point, you might start to think, \u2018I bet other people\u2019s spouses remember to turn off the lights and aren\u2019t so wasteful.\u2019 Seek out couples therapy before you get to the point. You never want to unfavorably judge your partner\u2019s behavior and compare it with real or imagined alternatives.\u201d \u2015 Danielle Kepler, a therapist in Chicago, Illinois\n\nThink of it this way: You wouldn\u2019t wait until your tooth cracked on a Saturday night to find a dentist.\n\n\u201cYou should have a therapist in your portfolio the same way you have a financial advisor, or mechanic or a dentist. The worst time to look for a new dentist is late on Saturday night when you\u2019ve just blown up a molar on a pistachio. Even if your relationship isn\u2019t in trouble, it\u2019s good to have some strategy for checking in and staying connected. That could be date night or a shared activity you love, but going to therapy can help expose questions you didn\u2019t know to ask. A good therapist can help you dive deeper into issues that may be surprising you. They can hold you accountable for prioritizing your relationship. You\u2019re more likely to have a 60th anniversary party if you have intentional strategies for maintaining the health of the relationship.\u201d \u2015 Zach Brittle, a therapist and founder of the online couples therapy series forBetter", "description": "Marriage therapy isn't just for couples in dire straits.", "authors": ["Senior Lifestyle Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d728ded2300003300512620.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2017-06-27"}
