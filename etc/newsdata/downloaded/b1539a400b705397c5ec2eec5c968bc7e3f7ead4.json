I thought I might die.\n\n\"Every time I took a breath, it felt like I was drowning in red hot water.\n\n\"All I felt was heat, not oxygen.\"\n\nKevin had suffered burns to his head and fingertips, as well as smoke inhalation and was treated in hospital with oxygen and intravenous fluids.\n\nWhen he came out of hospital, he found he was homeless due to the damage to the building, which cost around \u00a360,000 and months of work to repair.\n\nAfter staying with family for a few weeks, he rented a temporary flat and hopes to return to his original home - where he had lived for 13 years - next month after builders have repaired the damage.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nThen, he says he will try rebuild his life and move on.\n\nHe said: \"Louise had threatened to do it loads of time but I didn't think she'd do it.\n\n\"She'd said 'If I can't have you, nobody is having you.' At the end of her day, I was her rock.\n\n\"She was fine when she was sober but as soon as she had a drink, that was it.\n\n\"She'd become the total opposite of what she normally was. I think she did it because she knew I'd had enough.\"\n\nLooking back over their relationship, the 50-year-old says she was controlling and accused him of cheating.\n\nHe said: \"I wasn't allowed out and she said I was having sex with other women.\n\n\"She'd ask me why I have a scratch on my side, and say it was from a woman. She hated me going out with my mates.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n\"When we were fine, we were fine, but as soon as she needed a drink, that's when it started.\"\n\nHe added: \"She'd come at me with knives and push them in my cheek and things like that.\n\n\"It would be when she was drunk or when she couldn't get money from me.\"\n\nAnd Kevin says he gradually realised that he was being abused.\n\nHe said: \"It's like anybody that's in an abusive relationship, you just put up with it.\n\n\"It's like when women are being hit and they get asked why they stayed, they say they don't know.\n\n\"It's just that you think there's nothing else. I'd rather be with somebody than with nobody.\n\n\"You put up with it, when you have the good times, they obviously don't make up for the bad times, but you feel a bit better.\n\n\"It came up gradually, it was only the last year or two that she started to get physically violent.\"\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nThe couple entered into a relationship around seven years ago after chatting over Facebook .\n\nHe said: \"For the first year or so, everything was brilliant.\n\n\"But then she started turning up drunk, but after a couple of years, we'd fallen in love.\n\n\"I just kept shrugging it off but it just kept getting worse and worse.\n\n\"Towards the end, she got physical, because she knew I wouldn't react.\n\n\"The problem was, every time I got rid of her, she seemed to know when I was feeling vulnerable and lonely.\n\n\n\n\"She'd ask if she'd come home, and you'd think maybe she'd changed, it would be different.\"\n\nBut Kevin broke off the relationship on New Year's Day after Louise became drunk and abusive again.\n\nHe said: \"I felt like I was free, it felt like the shackles were off.\"\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nNow he hopes to recover from the psychological effects of the fire.\n\nKevin said: \"I went to visit my flat, now it's been done up, and it looks completely different.\n\n\"My landlord rang me up and asked me to have a look as I knew that I couldn't stay there if it made me feel like it did after the fire.\n\n\"I really struggled when I moved into a flat after leaving my sisters.\n\n\"There was no window in the bedroom and because of the heat, I kept getting up as I thought there was a fire.\n\n\"And because I was on the main road, the smells of the car drove me mad.\n\n\"It still bothers me now. I couldn't cook for months afterwards.\n\n\"But I wanted to pull myself together. I'm quite strong willed and I wanted to get myself back together.\n\n\"I'm constantly on edge. Nothing bothered me before.\n\n\"I'm a big bloke, covered in tattoos and I weigh fifteen and a half stone, nothing bothered me.\n\n\"The only thing I was afraid of was spiders, but it's all different now.\"\n\nPodmore, of no fixed abode, at first denied responsibility for the blaze, but pleaded guilty to an offence of arson with intent to endanger life.\n\nShe was jailed for seven years and given one year's credit for her guilty plea.\n\nAnd she was slapped with an indefinite restraining order preventing her from contacting Kevin in any way.\n\nMiss Lisa Hancox, mitigating barrister, told Shrewsbury Crown Court: \"In my submission, in this case there was no accelerant used. By her account she went to see Mr Foulkes. Things had gone sour. She was demanding his attention, she didn't get it and, under the influence of alcohol, she made a very wrong decision.\"\n\nJudge Peter Barrie said: \"One of the most concerning features of this case is that there is evidence that you have started fires before. You have no convictions for those so I am cautious about them. However, any tendency to start fires is deeply troubling.\"\n\nHe added: \"You are not mentally ill. You do have some persistent depression for which you are getting treatment and you get some sympathy, but it is clear that the it is drink that lies a the heart of your offending behaviour.\"\n\nPodmore must serve half the term minus spent already spent in custody on prison remand before being released on licence.", "description": "Twisted ex Louise Podmore told Kevin Faulks: \"If I can't have you, no one else can\" and stuffed burning paper in his letterbox as he slept", "authors": ["Rosaleen Fenton", "Image", "Mirrorpix", "Police Handout", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20445518.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_THP_CHPP_041019Slug_6636JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
