Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) on Wednesday criticized President Donald Trump for sharing a tweet that falsely claimed she was partying on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks when in fact the video was of a Sept. 13 event.\n\nIn his latest smear against the freshman member of Congress, Trump retweeted a since-deleted post that wrongly said Omar \u2015 based on video footage of her dancing with other elected officials \u2015 \u201cpartied on the anniversary of 9/11.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President of the United States is continuing to spread lies that put my life at risk,\u201d Omar tweeted. \u201cWhat is Twitter doing to combat this misinformation?\u201d\n\nThe footage stems from a celebratory Congressional Black Caucus event Friday in Washington, D.C., at the Culture House, a nonprofit venue centered on the arts and community. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, shared the original video on Twitter the day of the event.\n\nMultiple livestream videos and tweets posted on Twitter show the event took place Friday, Sept. 13.\n\nAs Omar noted Wednesday on Twitter, the event during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation\u2019s annual Legislative Conference, celebrated Black women in Congress. Reps. Ayanna Pressley, Lauren Underwood and Jahana Hayes were also there. The entire week\u2019s events, from Sept. 11 to 15, included a series of policy forums.\n\nThis is from a CBC event we hosted this weekend to celebrate black women in Congress.\n\n\n\nThe President of the United States is continuing to spread lies that put my life at risk.\n\n\n\nWhat is Twitter doing to combat this misinformation? https://t.co/XdkRVrU7mZ \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) September 18, 2019\n\nThe Twitter account for the PCCC called the false claim \u201can abhorrent lie that endangers a Member of Congress.\u201d\n\nThe tweet has since been deleted amid multiple calls for it to be removed. Twitter said in an email to HuffPost that it did not take action on the tweet and that it was instead deleted by the individual.\n\nTrump\u2019s quote-tweet that promoted the false claim remains on his account. Many on Twitter, including Pressley, called for the president\u2019s account to be suspended.\n\nTo be clear, this was a CBC community event on the 13th. That being said, lies like the ones he\u2019s trying to spread endanger our lives and our staffs\u2019 lives.@Twitter should delete this immediately&suspend his account while you\u2019re at it https://t.co/YO5uUyafhY \u2014 Ayanna Pressley (@AyannaPressley) September 18, 2019\n\nWhen asked about the calls to suspend Trump\u2019s account, Twitter referred HuffPost to its statement on world leaders published to its blog, which states, in part: \u201cBlocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets would hide important information people should be able to see and debate.\u201d\n\nTrump has routinely used his Twitter account to unleash attacks against Omar and other congresswomen of color.\n\nIn April, he tweeted an out-of-context video clip of a speech in which Omar said that \u201csome people did something\u201d on Sept. 11, 2001, that led to a rise in anti-Muslim reactions. The president characterized the phrase as a dismissal of terrorism. Omar, one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, was speaking at an event for the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\nOmar released a statement days later saying she received an increase in threats to her life after the president tweeted the misleading video.\n\nRep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the No. 2 Republican in the House of Representatives, has frequently lamented the coarseness of political discourse, connecting bad political rhetoric to violence like the assassination attempt he survived in 2017.\n\nScalise told HuffPost on Wednesday that he hadn\u2019t seen the president\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d Scalise told HuffPost. \u201cBut I\u2019ll take a look at it.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Scalise did not respond to a request for a follow-up comment.\n\nThe PCCC created a petition Wednesday calling on Twitter to suspend Trump\u2019s account until the president removes his recent post about Omar.\n\nSIGN THE PETITION: @Twitter must suspend @realDonaldTrump's Twitter account until he removes his violence-inducing post spreading lies about Rep. @Ilhan.
