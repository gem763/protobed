AP\n\nBlaming Democrats for Wednesday's 500-plus point fall (by just over 2 per cent) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Mr Trump accused his opponents on Twitter of being \"willing to hurt the Country, with only the 2020 Election in mind!\".\n\nA clearly enraged President again lashed out at a whistleblower who alerted Congress to Mr Trump's Ukraine call, saying they should only be protected \"if the whistleblower's legitimate\".\n\n\"This country has to find out who that person was, because that person's a spy, in my opinion,\" Mr Trump said as he sat beside visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Trump's threat against the whistleblower puts him directly at odds with a powerful Republican ally, Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley, who on Tuesday defended the person's anonymity.\n\n\"This person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected,\" Senator Grassley said. \"Complaints based on second-hand information should not be rejected out of hand, but they do require additional leg work to get at the facts and evaluate the claim's credibility.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, right, and Adam Schiff. AP\n\nIn a sign he sees the mounting danger facing him, after speculation in some quarters across Washington that the White House was unprepared to confront the impeachment challenge, Mr Trump took direct aim at key Democrats leading the charge.\n\nHe slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for failing to focus on her San Francisco-area district, where people are \"dying in squalor\". He then turned his sights on Mr Schiff, who has subpoenaed in recent days several key administration figures, describing him as a \"shifty dishonest guy\".\n\n\"That guy couldn't carry his blank strap,\" Mr Trump said. The word \"blank\" is apparently a reference to \"jock\".\n\nMr Schiff, who is leading the impeachment process, warned the White House that any efforts to stonewall the inquiry \"will be considered further evidence of obstruction of justice\".\n\n\"We're not fooling around here.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAttacks on the whistleblower by Mr Trump were a \"blatant effort to intimidate witnesses\", Mr Schiff said.\n\n\"It's an incitement of violence. I would hope that we're starting to see members of both parties speaking out against attacking this whistleblower and others that have pertinent information,\" he said.\n\nFormer US special envoy to Ukraine, who resigned last week, is expected to appear before the intelligence committee later on Thursday.\n\nThe impeachment process against Mr Trump exploded into life last week after reports that a whistleblower account of presidential wrongdoing was withheld from Congress.\n\nA day after Ms Pelosi dropped her long-held resistance against impeachment, Congress released the whistleblower complaint, which alleges Mr Trump used the power of his office to cajole Ukraine's president into investigating Mr Biden.\n\nEarlier this week Australia was dragged into the fray after The New York Times reported that Mr Trump had pressed Prime Minister Scott Morrison to look into the actions in 2016 of former London High Commissioner Alexander Downer that may have helped trigger the FBI's covert probe into Russian presidential election interference.", "description": "After a day of lying low, Donald Trump erupted with profanity and abuse aimed at Democrat impeachment tormentors after they warned; \"we're not fooling around\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5368%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_702%2C$y_15/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d58d8aff53f3aae8da0c7d3db983402a7f0441af", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
