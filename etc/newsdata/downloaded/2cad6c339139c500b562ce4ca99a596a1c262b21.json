An LPR-equipped drone could theoretically identify and track a single car for miles.\n\nRead: The military-style surveillance technology being tested in American cities\n\nMixing and matching technology in this way provides law enforcement with certain loopholes. Police need a warrant before placing a GPS tracking device on your car, for example, but not for querying an LPR database for a list of all your locations. Technology develops faster than privacy laws can keep up, especially in border communities, where law enforcement already enjoys enhanced privileges. Within 25 miles of the border, CBP agents theoretically operate under qualified immunity, empowering them to patrol private lands. Within 100 miles of the border, CBP agents can set up checkpoints and question, search, and potentially detain travelers if they believe they have probable cause.\n\n\u201cYou can view this extension of the border as a [way] for federal authorities to maintain jurisdiction over large swaths of land,\u201d says Mana Azarmi, a policy counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology, \u201c[and] permit them to do more and more invasive things.\u201d\n\nWhile CBP\u2019s drone surveillance is restricted to the 100-mile border zone, the agency records footage and collects data\u2014largely unnoticed and unchallenged\u2014far beyond that. The EFF report found that many local and state police departments use drones as part of a suite of advanced tech, meaning that for citizens living in border communities, aerial surveillance is ongoing at the federal, state, and local levels simultaneously. Azarmi worries that this allows local police to overstep the boundaries of justifiable surveillance, \u201cturning border enforcement into more of a dragnet surveillance system.\u201d\n\nIncluded in the EFF\u2019s data set is a series of CBP missions conducted using the Predator B drone, which is equipped with long-range cameras and sensors to detect illegal border crossings and coordinate with CBP agents on the ground. The report also includes a link to a data set that catalogs hundreds of drone flights over Texas hospitals, community centers, churches, and so on, from 2015 to 2017; the state\u2019s Department of Public Safety was looking for marijuana fields and tunnels. Though U.S. agencies don\u2019t have the authority to surveil Mexico, the Texas report notes that drone flight paths dipped into Mexico regularly.", "description": "New reports suggest that drone activity at the southern border is spreading to nearby cities, erasing the line between police procedures and immigration enforcement.", "authors": ["Sidney Fussell"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_100908043027/facebook.jpg?1570815269", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
