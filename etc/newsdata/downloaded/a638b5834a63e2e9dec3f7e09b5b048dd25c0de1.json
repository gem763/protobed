That arguably turned out to be an ill-founded prediction since President Donald Trump, some of his attorneys and many of his allies made sustained efforts to paint Mueller as a hack carrying out a vendetta against Trump on behalf of Democrats.\n\n\u201cI am not convinced that an authorization is needed, but unequivocally, if one is, the overwhelming need of the Government for Mr. Mueller\u2019s services greatly outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the integrity of the Department\u2019s programs and operations,\u201d Shaw wrote in a May 18, 2017 memo to Associate Deputy Attorney General Scott Schools. \u201cI am not certain that a reasonable person in possession of the relevant facts would question his impartiality.\u201d\n\nThe key \u2014 and perhaps the only \u2014 ethics issue addressed in the memo is whether Mueller\u2019s work as a partner at law firm Wilmer Hale created a potential conflict because a Wilmer client was involved in the investigation.\n\nShaw doesn\u2019t mention the client\u2019s name but it appears to be former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was represented by Wilmer partner Reginald Brown before Manafort switched to other attorneys a couple of months before his indictment in October 2017.\n\nMueller \u201chas not represented the current firm client who may have some involvement in the investigation and has no confidential information pertaining to that client,\u201d Shaw wrote.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The report said Trump raised such complaints with senior adviser Steve Bannon, White House Counsel Don McGahn and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.\n\nAll three men told Mueller\u2019s team that they pushed back on or resisted requests to act on the alleged conflicts. Bannon called the claims \u201cridiculous,\u201d while McGahn viewed them as \u201csilly\u201d and \u201cnot real.\u201d The issue of the alleged conflicts triggered a major falling-out between Trump and McGahn, as well as a dispute over whether Trump instructed McGahn to have Mueller fired on that basis.\n\nIn June 2017, one of Trump\u2019s personal lawyers did call Mueller\u2019s office to complain about the alleged conflicts, including Mueller\u2019s work for Wilmer Hale, according to the special counsel\u2019s report. Around the same time, close Trump friend Chris Ruddy gave an interview to PBS\u2019 Newshour decrying \u201creal conflicts\u201d for Mueller and specifically mentioning Mueller\u2019s status at the law firm.\n\nYet, just weeks before the public and private tempest over the issue, the Justice ethics official concluded there would be no reasonable resistance to Mueller on grounds of his impartiality.\n\n\u201cMr. Mueller served as Director of the FBI for 12 years,\u201d Shaw wrote. \u201cHe served the last two years of his tenure after Congress passed a statute specifically authorizing him to serve two years beyond the statutory term for FBI Directors. He served as Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division. He served as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California. He has been appointed to positions of responsibility by presidents of both political parties. He has a longstanding reputation for integrity.\u201d\n\nThe disclosure of the memo is obviously belated, coming more than two years after Mueller\u2019s appointment and about five months after he closed up shop.\n\nStill, it is something of a breakthrough, since the Justice Department often seeks to withhold the rationale for ethics waivers by separating the bare-bones waiver from the underlying paperwork, which is typically treated as a recommendation exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nHowever, the final two paragraphs of Shaw\u2019s memo are still almost entirely redacted as relating to Justice\u2019s deliberative process.\n\nJeffrey Light, an attorney for Property of the People, said the group may press further for those still-secret passages in its ongoing Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. \u201cThe case is still live and my client is still considering how to proceed,\u201d Light told POLITICO.\n\nThis article tagged under: Justice Department\n\nRobert Mueller", "description": "Top Justice Department ethics official concluded it was unlikely any reasonable person would doubt Mueller's independence.", "authors": ["Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/03/35/b1564ddf403da1d5341ee73a23d4/19914-mueller-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
