That starts with the big men doing their job well.\"\n\nHansen added: \"Defence is 50 percent of the game and probably 90 percent when you take in the psychological value of it.\n\n\"We kept our discipline. When they carried we got up and made our tackles and they were punishing tackles and forced some errors. When you're doing that teams start to second-guess a little bit and psychologically, you get an edge.\"\n\nThat edge also nullified a raucous Tokyo Stadium seemingly half-full of Ireland fans.\n\n\"The Irish are some of the best travellers in the world, they go anywhere for a party and they enjoy it, they've got their songs and their way of doing things. It was sort of like a home match feeling,\" Hansen said.\n\nHansen also questioned the merit of experience, saying it was a \"funny thing\", with Ireland having never advanced beyond the quarter-finals of a World Cup despite boasting players with huge numbers of caps.\n\n\"A lot of our young guys have been involved in championship-winning teams in Super Rugby and big moments and that's why you can select them with confidence,\" he said.\n\n\"Their enthusiasm, excitement and ability to play the game in the form they're in is really important, but so is leadership of the guys who've been through the tough moments.\n\n\"Half of our 23 have played in a knock-out tournament and won it and that was the difference.\n\n\"I'm not being disrespectful in saying this, but Ireland's experience is of not winning, but we had 11 guys who had experience of winning.\"\n\nTurning to semi-final opponents England, who beat Australia 40-16 in the day's first quarter-final, Hansen said: \"I'm looking forward to playing them too now that we've earned the right to.\n\n\"They'll be a massive challenge. But tonight's not the night to be talking about that.\n\n\"We've got a formula that we work to. Test matches are hard work. You've got to take a wee bit of time to step off the merry-go-round and relax.\n\n\"We'll do that, enjoy our moment. It was a special Test match... we won't think about England until tomorrow.\"", "description": "NZ coach Steve Hansen hailed his team's stunning demolition of Ireland as a victory for a winning mentality and a disciplined pack of forwards.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7263/92448317987c48ef8873e83163811325.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
