Well now there's a new one. The GTX 1060 and the GTX 1660 are getting replaced. It's called the GTX 1660 Super, and it'll be available for Australians from today.\n\nWith an Australian MSRP of $399, the GTX 1660 Super comes in roughly $40 or $50 more than existing stock of the GTX 1660, and about the same amount less behind the GTX 1660 Ti. In an embargoed briefing, Nvidia explained that the GTX 1660 Ti would still be the fastest product in that lineup.\n\nIt's a card mostly targeted at those holding onto the GTX 1050 or GTX 1060, the latter f which is the most popular discrete GPU today in Steam's latest hardware survey results. The GTX 1660 Super is meant to have around two times the frame rate performance of the GTX 1050 in games like Apex Legends and Rainbow Six: Siege, while the 1660 Super is aiming at 1.5x the performance of the original GTX 1060 6GB model.\n\nThere's a new GTX 1650 Super available as well, but that won't launch internationally until November 22. Australian pricing isn't available for that just yet, but I'll have a separate post with the specs and MSRP when it becomes available.\n\nHere's the full specs for the GTX 1660 Super, which you can buy from today.\n\nNvidia Geforce GTX 1660 Super PRICE\n\n$399 MSRP\n\nRAM\n\n6GB GDDR6 BASE/BOOST CLOCK 1530/1785 MHz MEMORY SPEED 14Gbps MEMORY BANDWIDTH 336GB/s EST. POWER 125W CUDA CORES 1408 ARCHITECTURE Turing, NVENC Turing Encoder\n\n\n\nAlong with the new card is a new Game Ready Driver, one that's directly trying to offer some of the features AMD has been touting for months. The new driver will come with a Ultra Low Latency mode that's now compatible with G-SYNC monitors, so anyone with one of those screens won't have to choose between G-SYNC or better response times.\n\nAlong with that is expanded support for Nvidia's image sharpening implementation. With the new driver, image sharpening is now supported on all DX9, DX11 and DX12 games. Whether it's better than AMD's Radeon Image Sharpening isn't known yet, and there's also the question of whether the image improvements make something like the AI-powered DLSS a little redundant. Nvidia's tools let you control the sharpening strength, which is handy if you want to play at resolutions like 4K with a reduced resolution scale, but don't want the slightly blurry after effect. (Games like The Division 2 and Overwatch let you do this - it'll be fun to test after-Blizzcon how effective this is.) For screenshotters and those who enjoyed messing with post-processing filters like Reshade, that's now supported directly within the Nvidia Ansel.\n\nImage: Nvidia\n\nBeyond that, the latest driver also adds support for seven more monitors under the G-SYNC Compatible Display program. Those are:\n\nAcer CG437K P Acer VG272U P Acer VG272X AOC 27G2G4 ASUS XG279Q Dell AW2720HF Lenovo Y27Q-20\n\nThe new Game Ready Driver, version 441.08, is available now through Geforce.com or the Geforce Experience middleware.", "description": "Haven't had enough graphics cards this year?
