We have never asked anyone to fight for us. And we have never asked anyone anyone\u2019s permission to defend the State of Israel.\u201d", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about a possible mutual defense treaty between the two nations, a move that could bolster Netanyahu's re-election bid just days before Israelis go to the polls.", "authors": ["Alexandra Alper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429837663&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0I1", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
