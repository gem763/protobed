Stand with Hong Kong\u201d.\n\nOn Monday he tried to calm the water with a string of emollient tweets.\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d he tweeted Monday from Tokyo, where the Rockets are playing several matches this week.\n\n\u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention,\u201d Morey said.\n\nSemi-autonomous Hong Kong has been battered by four months of increasingly violent pro-democracy protests.\n\nThe rallies were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions to mainland China, fuelling fears of an erosion of liberties in Hong Kong under the 50-year \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model China agreed before the 1997 handover from Britain.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Regrettable\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe NBA issued its own statement, saying it recognised Morey\u2019s views \u201chave offended so many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets are due to play two pre-season games at Shanghai and Shenzhen later this week.\n\n\u201cWhile Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals\u2019 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them,\u201d the statement issued by chief communications officer Mike Bass said.\n\nBut the furore showed no sign of dying down, with Chinese state broadcaster CCTV saying it was \u201cstrongly opposed\u201d to Morey\u2019s \u201cimproper remarks\u201d and would no longer air Rockets games.\n\nTencent Holdings, which streams NBA games in China, said it would suspend Rockets coverage.\n\nSponsors including sportswear brand Li Ning and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank also announced Sunday they would stop cooperation with the team.\n\nThe moves came after the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) said it would sever all ties with the Rockets.\n\n\u201cGeneral manager of Houston Rockets club Daryl Morey made incorrect comments about Hong Kong,\u201d the CBA said on its official social media page on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese Basketball Association is strongly opposed to this and will suspend communication and cooperation with the club.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Major China fanbase \u2013\n\nThe Rockets have already tried to distance themselves from the controversy, with owner Tilman Fertitta on Friday writing on Twitter that Morey \u201cdoes NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets\u2026 we are NOT a political organization.\u201d\n\nBut fans on social media in China savaged Morey\u2019s comments, with some urging he be fired.\n\nThe Rockets are in Japan for two exhibition games and their head coach Mike D\u2019Antoni on Sunday said that was the team\u2019s focus.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to concentrate on playing in Japan, playing great games and enjoying the culture of Japan,\u201d he said.", "description": "Beijing (AFP) \u2013 The Houston Rockets were racing Monday to quell a growing storm in China that saw their games yanked from television over a tweet", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/e808bd_houston-rockets-had-large-in-china-signing-yao-ming-in-2002-china-rounds-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
