But it\u2019s not because of more water.\n\nIt\u2019s because the land, especially in Asia and the developing world, is several feet lower than what space-based radar has calculated, according to a study in the journal Nature Communications Tuesday.\n\nSo instead of 80 million people living in low-lying areas that would flood annually by 2050 as the world warms, this new study finds the population at risk is closer to 300 million people.\n\nAnd if emissions of heat-trapping gases continue unabated and Antarctic ice melts more in a worst-case scenario, around 500 million people could be at risk by the end of the century, according to the study by Climate Central , a New Jersey based non-profit of scientists and journalists.\n\nSpace-based radar says 170 million are at risk in that scenario.\n\nFor big picture global mapping of flooding threats, the go-to technology for elevation is NASA\u2019s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission . But that doesn\u2019t accurately show ground, instead mistaking rooftops and tree canopies for ground with an average error of 6.5 feet (2 meters), said Climate Central chief executive officer Ben Strauss, a scientist who studies sea level rise.\n\nFor the United States, much of Europe and Australia, this is not a problem because those areas use airborne lidar radar, which is more accurate about true elevation. But in flood prone Asia and other places that\u2019s not an option, Strauss said.\n\nSo Climate Central used the shuttle radar, artificial intelligence and 23 different variables to create a computer model that is more accurate in globally mapping elevation, Strauss said. They then tested it against the airplane-generated data in the United States and Australia and found this computer model was accurate, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is a far greater problem than we understood,\u201d Strauss said. \u201cFar more people live in risky places today than we thought and the problem only multiplies in the future.\u201d\n\nHe said the new model found \u201ca huge difference\u201d in elevation in places such as Shanghai, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangkok, Jakarta and Mumbai.\n\nFive outside sea level rise experts said the study highlighted a problem with current data, especially in Asia.\n\n\u201cThis study represents very significant progress in the understanding of the risk which climate change-related sea level will cause for hundreds of million of people before the end of this century,\u201d said Jean-Pascal van Ypersele of the Universite catholique de Louvain in Belgium. \u201cIf hundreds or even tens of millions of people are flooded in Asia or Africa, it will create social and economic disruptions on a huge scale.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Colorado\u2019s Steve Nerem said the problem is real, but he isn\u2019t sold on the new model yet, partly because it is based on the shuttle radar to begin with.\n\nIt does highlight an issue that needs to be fixed, said Katy Serafin at the University of Florida. \u201cThe longer we wait to address this, the less time we will have to develop adaptive and sustainable solutions to coastal flooding.\u201d\n\n___\n\nRead more stories on climate issues by The Associated Press at https://www.apnews.com/Climate\n\n___\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
