It is Christian! The mere fact of the noun \u2018Christian\u2019, \u2018I am Christ\u2019 is strong: it is an adjective noun, yes, but it is a noun.\n\n\u201cThe communicator must make people understand the weight of the reality of nouns that reflect the reality of people. And this is a mission of communication: to communicate with reality, without sweetening with adjectives or adverbs.\u201d\n\nThe Vatican Dicastery for Communication, led by prefect Paolo Ruffini, underwent a revamp this year, with Matteo Bruni, a British-Italian, appointed as director of the press office in June. Bruni\u2019s appointment came after the abrupt departure of American Greg Burke in late December.\n\nFrancis began his speech to the communications team by saying: \u201cI have a speech to read, it\u2019s not than long, it\u2019s seven pages \u2026 but I\u2019m sure that after the first one the majority of you will fall asleep.\u201d\n\nHe later added: \u201cFor the Church, communication is a mission. No investment is too great for spreading the Word of God. At the same time, every talent must be well spent, made to bear fruit.\u201d\n\nFrancis thanked the team, which is also responsible for maintaining his hugely popular Twitter account, for their work.\n\nPope Francis (@Pontifex) Let us learn to call people by their name, as the Lord does with us, and to give up using adjectives.\n\n\u201cBut what should communication be like?\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things you must not do is advertising, mere advertising. You must not behave like human business that try to attract more people \u2026 To use a technical word: you must not proselytise. It is not Christian to proselytise.\u201d", "description": "Pope gives views on language in speech to Vatican communications team", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7408cd8fbfe857f0d1d6e55ed27db82ae3d8bfc2/0_35_1805_1083/master/1805.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b8579ee39d83d910bc4d4c4d8ebddfa5", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
