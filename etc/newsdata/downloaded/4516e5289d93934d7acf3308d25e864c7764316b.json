This year, the extent of Arctic sea ice was the second-lowest ever recorded.\n\nPolar ice melt contributes to sea-level rise and also leads the planet to heat up faster, since ice reflects sunlight back into space.\n\nAn organization called Ice911 has proposed scattering tiny, glass spheres across parts of the Arctic to reflect more sunlight back into space and slow the thaw.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nThe Arctic is melting at unprecedented rates: Greenland\u2019s ice is disappearing six times faster than it was four decades ago. In August, the ice sheet lost 60 billion tons in just 5 days of summer thaw.\n\nOver the last four decades, we\u2019ve lost 75% of the volume of Arctic ice. The current extent of the sea ice is the second-lowest it\u2019s been since scientists started keeping track in 1979.\n\nIn addition to raising sea levels, this melting significantly contributes to climate change because Arctic ice reflects sunlight into space (in part because sea ice is bright and white). So less ice means less heat leaving the planet, which in turn leads more ice to melt. It\u2019s a vicious cycle.\n\nA nonprofit called Ice911 offers a potential solution to this ominous feedback loop: The group has proposed blanketing key parts of the Arctic in millions of hollow, glass microspheres to form a protective layer that reflects sunlight and insulates melting ice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re an awfully creative species, and we need to slow the climate-change clock,\u201d Leslie Field, the founder of Ice911, told Business Insider. \u201cTechnology like this gives us time to act.\u201d\n\nTiny silica beads at work\n\nThe tiny spheres Ice911 has developed look more like grains of sand than beads. They\u2019re manufactured from silica, a compound made of silicon and oxygen, because the material is abundant in the natural world and harmless to humans and animals.\n\ncaption Ice911\u2019s microspheres, which are somewhat like floating white sand, are made from a silicate glass that\u2019s mostly silicon dioxide. source Courtesy of Susan Kramer/Ice 911\n\nField described the microspheres as \u201csmall, fine, white beach sand\u201d that floats. In a sense, the material is a lot like snow.\n\nThe reflective beads stick to ice and water on contact, and their chemical composition ensures they don\u2019t attract oil-based pollutants. Simulations done by Ice911 suggest that using the technology to restore ice reflectivity could help lower temperatures by 1.5 degrees Celsius over a large part of the northern Arctic.\n\nBut so far, the technology is still in the field-test phase. Field said Ice911 started with \u201ca very small experiment in buckets\u201d on the deck of her own home, then conducted small tests at a lake in the Sierra Nevada mountains and a pond in Minnesota.\n\nIn the last two years, Field and her colleagues have brought the microspheres to the Arctic, where they spread the material over a frozen lake near Utqia\u0121vik (Barrow), Alaska. The results, some of which were reported in a May 2018 study, suggest the silica beads did indeed increase ice reflectivity and thickness.\n\ncaption Ice911\u2019s beads are tested in a small area of North Meadow Lake at the Barrow Environmental Observatory in Alaska. source Courtesy of Susan Kramer/Ice 911\n\nField doesn\u2019t want to blanket all 1.6 million square miles of Arctic sea ice with the beads, though. Instead, her team is using climate models to pinpoint strategic parts of the Arctic where the microspheres could have maximum impact.\n\nOne of these areas, she said, is the Fram Strait between Greenland and Svalbard \u2013 a hotspot of melting. That region is warming nearly four times faster than the global average.\n\n\u201cThis is where ice floes come to die, and the cemetery is filling faster each year,\u201d climate physicist Till Wagner told The Guardian earlier this year.\n\nField thinks that in three years, Ice911\u2019s technology could be deployed to curb this floe demise. But she estimates it would cost about $5 billion to scatter the microspheres on a meaningful scale.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at that cost, it\u2019s big,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the cost of doing nothing is far greater.\u201d\n\nFor now, she said, Ice911 still needs to conduct more tests and get proper permissions from governments and environmental groups before considering any large-scale deployment.\n\nShrinking Arctic sea ice\n\nEvery September, Arctic sea ice hits its minimum extent. Since the 1980s, that minimum has decreased by about 13% per decade, and the decline is accelerating, as the NASA animation below shows.\n\nIn 1979, Arctic sea ice spanned about 2.7 million square miles (7 million square kilometers). By last month, the extent had dropped to 1.7 million square miles (4.3 million square kilometers). According to NASA data, this year has tied 2007 for the second-lowest sea ice extent on record. The worst year was 2012, when the ice shrank to under 1 million square miles (2.6 million square kilometers).\n\nResearchers at the European Space Agency have warned that the current rate of carbon emissions means we could see an ice-free Arctic in just decades.\n\nField describes polar ice as Earth\u2019s \u201cheat shield.\u201d The Arctic\u2019s oldest, thickest sea ice lifts the heaviest load in terms of reflecting sunlight, but that\u2019s what\u2019s thawing fastest. About 95% of this bright, multi-year-old sea ice disappeared in 2018.\n\nThat\u2019s the ice that Ice911 wants to save.\n\nField says her invention is a climate solution, not geoengineering\n\ncaption A giant iceberg is seen behind an Innaarsuit settlement, Greenland, July 12, 2018. source Ritzau Scanpix / Karl Petersen / via REUTERS\n\nField, who has 55 patents, said she first pinpointed ice reflectivity as the climate \u201clever\u201d she wanted to pull in 2006, after watching Al Gore\u2019s documentary \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth.\u201d The film explains that the loss of reflectivity in the Arctic had contributed to one-fifth of global temperature rise.\n\nSince that documentary came out, researchers\u2019 warnings about the consequences of climate change have gotten much more dire. That has led some scientists and politicians, like Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, to consider geoengineering technologies that could essentially hack our climate.\n\nGeoengineering strategies range from developing facilities that suck carbon dioxide out of the air on the safer end of the spectrum, to deliberately injecting reflective chemicals into the atmosphere to send more sunlight back into space on the more extreme side.\n\nRead More: We\u2019re altering the climate so severely that we\u2019ll soon face apocalyptic consequences. Here are 11 last-ditch ways we could hack the planet to reverse that trend.\n\nField and her team referred to Ice911\u2019s technology as \u201clocalized, reversible geoengineering\u201d in their 2018 paper, but she emphasized that the beads are \u201cdifferent than what has come to be known as geoengineering primarily.\u201d\n\nInstead, she said, Ice911\u2019s microspheres are \u201cworking to rebuild something that was, until recently, already there, not taking the climate on a new path.\u201d\n\ncaption Vangelis Christoduoluo, an Ice911 volunteer, stands next to a remote monitoring buoy that collects data on the beads\u2019 effectiveness. source Courtesy of Susan Kramer/Ice 911\n\nPlus, given that the beads are made of material that\u2019s \u201cdarn close to ubiquitous in the environment,\u201d Field added, she sees \u201ca defensible distinction\u201d between her organization\u2019s approach and efforts to, say, inject chemicals into the atmosphere.\n\nA 2018 article in Nature noted that geoengineering Arctic and Antarctic glaciers could buy us crucial time to address climate change. But Field was quick to note that Ice911\u2019s work should not be seen as a sufficient solution on its own.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this to be an excuse for coal mines, I don\u2019t want people to say, \u2018We don\u2019t have to change a thing because the engineers will fix it,'\u201d she said.\n\nBut given that polar melting is on track to raise seas 3 feet by 2100 and threatens to displace hundreds of millions of people, Field added, the need for Ice911\u2019s technology is now \u201curgent and demonstrable.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - The Arctic is melting faster than ever.
