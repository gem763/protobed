I'm taking care of the one body I have.\n\nDespite aiming to hit the gym on most days, for at least 20 minutes, she also also shared that it is \"important\" to have rest days.\n\nIt comes after Jennifer hinted that she is working on a project with her Friends co-stars but vehemently denied that it is a reboot of the hit American sitcom.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nShe discussed working with her former co-stars David Schwimmer, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and Matthew Perry during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres show on Monday.\n\nKeeping things under wraps, as she sat on the sofa alongside musician Charlie Puth, Jennifer said that her and her fellow stars would love there to be \"something\" but they aren't yet sure what that \"something\" is.\n\nEllen quizzed: \"Like a reboot of the show?\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nShutting down the thought of Friends revamp, she responded: \"No.\"\n\nProving she has hopes of reuniting on screen with the cast, she added: \"Listen, we would love for there to be something, but we don't know what that something is, so we're just trying, we're working on something.\"\n\nTrying to pry, Ellen said: \"We can safely say it's probably not a reboot, a movie though.\"\n\nJennifer joked: \"Huge, huge, huge movie. We don't know.\"\n\n\"A possibility that it's a movie,\" Ellen added.\n\nKeeping tight-lipped, the Horrible Bosses star told: \"I don't know yet! I don't want to lead people on.\"\n\n(Image: The Ellen Show)\n\nEllen then tried to delve deeper by questioning the beauty about the reason behind the six actors getting together - which was documented on Jennifer's first ever Instagram post.\n\nJennifer explained: \"We did that because we miss each other and we all happened to be in the same part of the world.\"\n\nBut singer Charlie, who was a guest on the daytime show, pushed for more information.\n\nCharlie jibbed: \"Sounds like to me there's something in the works.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
