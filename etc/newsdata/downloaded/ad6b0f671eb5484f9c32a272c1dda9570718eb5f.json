'The only condition was I couldn\u2019t know who was going to be on it. I said to the team, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find some acts who you believe can sell records off the back of this, because if you don\u2019t do that it won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\n'So that was the deal and we stuck to it. I swear to God I didn\u2019t have a clue who any of the acts were. I did walk away thinking, \u201cIf we\u2019re smart, we have artists here who could actually sell records off the back of this\u201d. So I thought that was fun and very exciting for the show.'\n\nThe music boss also shared how he felt about holding the auditions in his own back garden.\n\nHe said: 'When we filmed it that night it didn\u2019t feel like work. I loved every second of it. I said to the producers, \u201cIf this really doesn\u2019t work, we will have to re-audition for the show. That\u2019s the deal.\u201d\n\n'So the fact that I felt we didn\u2019t need to was just great. I found it interesting and fun, and doing this version of the show has also given me the chance to do All Stars. I\u2019ve wanted to make the best of the best version of The X Factor for a long, long time. It\u2019s been brilliant. I\u2019ve loved every minute.'\n\nHe's back!

I think everyone\u2019s going to love watching these celebrities because it\u2019s not what people expect. Some of them are really good.\n\n'The show feels more exciting, there\u2019s no bootcamp, no six chair challenge, it feels slick this year. It\u2019s been the best show on TV for a long time and has just had a little rebranding, I suppose, a new X Factor.'", "description": "Little Mix are reportedly set to ruffle some feathers with their former boss Simon Cowell as they plan to launch their own Saturday night TV show.", "authors": ["Charlotte Dean For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/00/19564030-0-image-a-175_1570750493157.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
