They said she had depression and a history of experiencing psychotic episodes.\n\nLawyers said she might become agitated and lose the mental capacity to make decisions during labour. If that happened, they said, doctors would have to act quickly and needed to know that they could legally perform a caesarean section without the woman\u2019s agreement if necessary.\n\nThe judge analysed the case at a hearing in the court of protection, where issues relating to people who might lack the mental capacity to make decisions are considered. He said the case was exceptional and the order he had been asked to make was \u201cdraconian\u201d.\n\nHe said issues relating to whether doctors should override the wishes of people if they lose the capacity to make decisions were rarely considered. But he said the interests of the woman were paramount and doctors must be able to do what was needed to preserve her life and the life of her child.\n\nHe concluded it would be in the woman\u2019s best interests to allow doctors to deliver the baby by caesarean section against her will if such a move was necessary. The woman, who is in her 30s and being cared for in London, could not be identified in media reports of the case, the judge said.\n\nOfficials at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS foundation trust, who have responsibility for the woman\u2019s obstetric care, and those at South London and Maudsley NHS foundation trust, who have responsibility for her psychiatric care, had asked the judge to make a ruling.\n\nBridget Dolan QC, who led the legal team representing the two NHS trusts, said the woman had been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder.\n\n\u201cWhilst the view currently is that [her] impairment or disturbance in the functioning of her mind or brain \u2013 ie bipolar affective disorder \u2013 does not impair her capacity to consent to obstetric treatment, her consultant psychiatrist is of the opinion that there is a substantial risk of her condition worsening close to or during labour, to the point where capacity is impaired,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnticipatory orders and/or declarations are therefore sought to enable the lawful provision of such care and treatment as is clinically indicated, including emergency caesarean section, to [her] and her unborn child to ensure their health and safety and to minimise the risk of any significant and long-lasting harm.\u201d\n\nThe woman was not represented by lawyers at the hearing. The judge, who also hears cases in the family division of the high court, said the urgency of the situation meant the application had been made at short notice and there had not been enough time for the woman to instruct lawyers or for lawyers to be instructed on her behalf.\n\nThe barrister Parishil Patel QC appeared at the hearing without instructions to guard her interests. He acted as an amicus, or \u201cfriend of the court\u201d.", "description": "Ruling comes despite woman, who has bipolar disorder, saying she does not want procedure", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/381298579c2efec8a79245233871afe4f070cd0f/0_0_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a044e561dabb3be799a59b536c341065"}
