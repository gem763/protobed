Even when I was doing my solo album, I didn't feel 100 per cent,\" Stephen - who died 10 years ago today - told The Mirror in 2006.\n\n\"I missed the guys. It was weird being on your own in Asia promoting yourself and not having your buddies there. I had to get help.\"\n\nThe situation became worse when his career flopped as bandmate Ronan Keating's soared, and in 2001 he was dropped from his label.\n\nDoctors gave him antidepressants - on which he became dependant - and he reportedly began having suicidal thoughts.\n\n\"I was a zombie. On these antidepressants you can't even laugh or cry,\" he said.\n\nHis relationship with Dutch singer Eloy De Jong also crumbled in 2001 under the pressure of the relentless promo trail.\n\nAnd when a member of Boyzone's entourage bumped into the singer by chance, he said Stephen appeared to be in a bad way.\n\n\"I was really shocked when I set eyes on him. He looked vacant and spacey,\" the friend told the Daily Mail.\n\nBut everything changed by what Stephen called a \"bolt out of the blue\" - namely a voicemail from Elton John and his partner David Furnish.\n\n\"Listen Stephen, we feel that you're down,\" Elton said.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"We're at our home in Nice - we want you to come down. Come stay, if you want to.\"\n\nTwo days later Stephen was on a flight to France, where he and former drug addict Elton \"talked over things.\"\n\n\"It was all very intimidating at first, but I thought, 'what have I got to lose?'\" Stephen recalled.\n\n\"They've been really supportive of me and always phone up to see if I'm okay. Elton has a sixth sense if there's something not right with someone - he's really in tune like that.\n\n\"When I got to sit down with him he was so genuine, so nice, and just wanted to offer words of encouragement. No pressure, he just asked me how I was, and we had a lovely, lovely time. After that my life just changed.\"\n\nAnd it really did change. In 2003 Elton and David introduced Stephen to handsome internet tycoon Andrew Cowles.\n\nThey married in 2006 and stayed together until Stephen's tragic death from an undiagnosed heart defect on October 10, 2009, aged just 33.\n\n\"My lowest point was when Boyzone split and I turned to antidepressants,\" Stephen told Reveal in the last interview before his death.\n\n\"Now I've found true love with Andrew and I feel like I can be my real self again.\"", "description": "Late Boyzone star Stephen Gately was struggling in the wake of the band's split - until Elton John intervened", "authors": ["Frances Kindon", "Image", "Getty", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article108309.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_stephen-gately-pic-rex-693232967.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
