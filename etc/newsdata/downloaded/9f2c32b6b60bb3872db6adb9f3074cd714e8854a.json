(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The killing of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi gave President Donald Trump an undeniable national security triumph and also a much-needed political victory at the most precarious moment of his presidency.\n\nImperiled by an impeachment inquiry and facing fierce foreign policy criticism from within his own party, Trump basked in the win Sunday, at first announcing the raid like so many of his predecessors, with solemnity for the mission in Syria and praise for the brave Americans and allies who carried it out.\n\nAs the minutes passed, he reverted to the president who has tried to redefine the office and how Americans view it, using graphic language and awkward ad-libs while doling out swipes at his political foes, at home and abroad, and turning the triumph into a moment, more than anything, about Donald J. Trump himself.\n\nBut despite the uniquely grandiose Trumpian flourishes, the president's White House reveal of al-Baghdadi's death gave him a destined-for-the-history-books image to place alongside Barack Obama's iconic announcement of the killing of Osama Bin Laden and provided a potential bulwark to the rising tide of impeachment and a ready-made line for this 2020 reelection campaign.\n\n\"The al-Baghdadi raid is a gold star for the Trump presidency. It was a lifeline to him because his poll numbers are tumbling and people think he's made significant foreign policy mistakes in the Middle East,\" said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley of Rice University. \"Just when he is massively hemorrhaging, he is able to claim a foreign policy win. Impeachment will swirl around him but this is concrete.\"\n\nThe timing of the triumph appears ideal for Trump.\n\nThe president's poll numbers had slipped amid the Democrats impeachment inquiry into the request Trump made of Ukraine to investigate a political foe, leading to a parade of officials providing damaging testimony on Capitol Hill. Moreover, the raid comes amid a fusillade of criticism aimed at Trump's recent decision to pull most U.S. troops out of Syria with some of the sharpest attacks coming from Senate Republicans, usual allies who, were the president to be impeached by the Democratic-led House, would hold his fate in their hands.\n\n\"This allows him to say we can still succeed in Syria in light of all that has happened there in recent weeks because of his policy change,\" said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nHaass cautioned that because of the slippery, shadowy nature of the Islamic State group, al-Baghdadi's death was \"not a transformational event\" that would forever cripple the network. But he underscored that for the nation and for Trump, \"It was a good day because it sends the message that no enemy of the United States is safe.\"\n\nIn a national Sunday morning address, Trump described the daring nighttime airborne raid by American special operations forces in Syria's northwestern Idlib province and said they flew over heavily militarized territory controlled by multiple nations and forces.\n\nPresidents are often measured by how they handle important national moments, the words they use becoming part of the permanent tableau of their time in office. When Trump hewed to his prepared remarks, he was in league with his predecessors. But when he diverted, when a moment of national resolve and triumph turned into just another riffing question-and-answer session, he risked diminishing the moment.\n\nAs he so often does, Trump offered a commentary on the images that he had just watched, but this time he was not reacting to cable news talking heads, but rather video he viewed in the Situation Room as the raid was carried out, gloatingly narrating gruesome details about the militant leader's death.\n\n\"He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast,\" Trump said. \"The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him.\"\n\nAnd before long, the story was less about the raid and more about him. The targets of his grievances were familiar: Democrats, with whom he did not share information about the mission, as well as European nations, many of which have defied his wishes and disagreed with his policies. He also, once more, compared himself to his immediate predecessor and boasted what he had done was grander.", "description": "The killing of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi gave President Donald Trump an undeniable national security triumph and also a much-needed political victory at the most precarious moment of his presidency.
