At least one performer has since been removed from the event\u2019s lineup.\n\nFallout over the roster of artists for the Intersect music and arts festival, which is being held in Las Vegas in December, surfaced this week after DJ and producer The Black Madonna said in a series of Thursday tweets that she was \u201cfurious\u201d that she was listed alongside artists playing the event, writing that she \u201cabsolutely didn\u2019t agree to this\u201d and \u201cWhat. The. Fucking Fuck.\u201d\n\nWhat the fuck is this Amazon shit? I absolutely didn\u2019t agree to this. Oh hell no. \u2014 THE BLACK MADONNA (@blackmadonnachi) October 17, 2019\n\n\u201cIf you were shocked I\u2019d play for Amazon, well that makes two of us. Please be patient and while I burn some bridges. Updates soon,\u201d she tweeted. Pitchfork, which reported on the incident on Thursday, was told by a spokesperson for Amazon claimed that AWS appeared multiple times in a contract signed by The Black Madonna\u2019s management.\n\n\u201cOur affiliation of the Intersect Festival is clear in the contract that was signed by Black Madonna\u2019s management team. \u2018Amazon Web Services\u2019 was named in the contract five separate times, and throughout creative materials that were reviewed and approved,\u201d the spokesperson told Pitchfork. \u201cRegardless, we\u2019ve decided to release her from her contractual obligation.\u201d\n\nIndeed, The Black Madonna\u2019s name no longer appears on the website for the event (though an Instagram post for the event that included the name was still live as of Friday). Reached for comment by Gizmodo, The Black Madonna noted her absence from the lineup Intersect\u2019s website and said she would be releasing a formal statement about the incident \u201cshortly.\u201d\n\nDespite AWS\u2019s claims that it made clear in contractual agreements who was behind the festival, The Black Madonna is not the only artist claiming that they were not informed the event was tied to Amazon. Another artist listed on promotional materials for the festival, Japanese Breakfast \u2014 the solo project of musician Michelle Zauner \u2014 said she too was unaware that the festival was being put on by one of the tech giant\u2019s key businesses.\n\n\u201cI will say like The Black Madonna it was not brought to my attention this was an AWS event,\u201d she said in a series of tweets on Friday. \u201cWhen we signed on for this fest months ago we weren\u2019t told it was presented by AWS. I agree that this and most corps have despicable practices and feel conflicted participating as I did [with] Coachella. I\u2019m still uncertain how to move forward as a small indie act on a bill.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not defending amazon or this festival by any means. I didn\u2019t even know this was an aws fest when we signed on. I\u2019m open to having this dialogue but this was the line in the sand I\u2019m talking about. A ton of musicians have used amazon money for prod expenses and mvs \u2014 Japanese Breakfast (@Jbrekkie) October 18, 2019\n\nAs of Friday, Japanese Breakfast was still listed as an artist performing the event on the Intersect website. Amazon Web Services did not immediately return Gizmodo\u2019s request for comment about the claims.\n\nThere are dozens of musical and visual artists listed as performers for the event, including headliners Beck, Kacey Musgraves, Foo Fighters, and Anderson.Paak. Of these, it appeared Friday that only the Foo Fighters had shared information related to Intersect on Twitter or Instagram. This is perhaps especially surprising of Musgraves, who is listed as performing a \u201cdrone light show celebrating women in tech\u201d at Intersect. And who wouldn\u2019t want to shill such an event?", "description": "Multiple artists who were listed in promotional materials for a music festival being put on by Amazon Web Services say they didn\u2019t know the festival had ties to the tech giant.
