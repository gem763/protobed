[Photo/VCG]\n\nStatement by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Downing Street\n\n2 September 2019\n\nFive weeks ago, I spoke to you from these steps and said that this Government was not going to hang around and that we would not wait until Brexit day \u2013 October 31 \u2013 to deliver on the priorities of the British people.\n\nAnd so I am proud to say that on Wednesday, Chancellor Sajid Javid is going to set out the most ambitious spending round for more than a decade.\n\nI said I wanted to make your streets safer \u2013 and that is why we are recruiting another 20,000 police officers.\n\nI said I wanted to improve your hospital and reduce waiting times at your GP.\n\nAnd so we are doing 20 new hospital upgrades in addition to the \u00a334 billion more going into the NHS.\n\nAnd I said I wanted every child in this country to have a superb education and that\u2019s why I announced last week that we are levelling up funding across the country and spending much more next year in both primary and secondary schools.\n\nAnd it\u2019s to push forward this agenda on these and many other fronts that we need a Queen\u2019s speech in October while leaving due time to debate Brexit and other matters.\n\nAnd as we come to that Brexit deadline, I am encouraged by the progress we are making.\n\nIn the last few weeks, the chances of a deal have been rising, I believe, for three reasons.\n\nThey can see that we want a deal.\n\nThey can see that we have a clear vision for our future relationship with the EU \u2013 something that has not always perhaps been the case.\n\nAnd they can see that we are utterly determined to strengthen our position by getting ready to come out regardless, come what may.\n\nBut if there is one thing that can hold us back in these talks, it is the sense in Brussels that MPs may find some way to cancel the referendum. Or that tomorrow, MPs will vote with Jeremy Corbyn for yet another pointless delay.\n\nI don\u2019t think they will. I hope that they won\u2019t.\n\nBut if they do, they will plainly chop the legs out from under the UK position and make any further negotiation absolutely impossible.\n\nAnd so I say, to show our friends in Brussels that we are united in our purpose, MPs should vote with the Government against Corbyn\u2019s pointless delay.\n\nI want everybody to know \u2013 there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on 31 October, no ifs or buts.\n\nWe will not accept any attempt to go back on our promises or scrub that referendum.\n\nAnd, armed and fortified with that conviction, I believe we will get a deal at that crucial summit in October \u2013 a deal that Parliament will certainly be able to scrutinize.\n\nAnd in the meantime, let our negotiators get on with their work, without that sword of Damocles over their necks, and without an election\u2026without an election. I don\u2019t want an election, you don\u2019t want an election.\n\nLet\u2019s get on with the people\u2019s agenda \u2013 fighting crime, improving the NHS, boosting schools, cutting the cost of living, unlocking talent and opportunity across the entire United Kingdom, with infrastructure, education and technology.\n\nIt is a massive agenda. Let\u2019s come together and get it done \u2013 and let\u2019s get Brexit done by October 31.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\uff08\u6765\u6e90\uff1a\u82f1\u56fd\u666e\u7f57\u6d3e\u4e50\u536b\u89c6\u5fae\u535a \u7f16\u8f91\uff1ayaning\uff09", "description": "\u5f53\u5730\u65f6\u95f49\u67082\u65e5\uff0c\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u524d\u9884\u544a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u82f1\u56fd\u9996\u76f8\u9c8d\u91cc\u65af\u00b7\u7ea6\u7ff0\u900a\u7a81\u7136\u53ec\u5f00\u5185\u9601\u7d27\u6025\u4f1a\u8bae\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5728\u5510\u5b81\u885710\u53f7\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u5916\u53d1\u8868\u7b80\u77ed\u58f0\u660e\u3002", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201909/10/5d76faaba310cf3e979b7d6a.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
