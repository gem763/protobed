Authorities have suspended Internet access across much of the country, and an indefinite curfew is in place.\n\nOn Friday, Iraq\u2019s Independent High Commission for Human Rights said the government had yet to share the full extent of the casualties, and it accused security forces of arresting wounded demonstrators from Iraq\u2019s hospitals.\n\nAD\n\nAli al-Bayati, a spokesman for the commission, said 35 people were arrested from hospitals in the southern city of Nasiriyah, with other detentions documented in Diwayinah and Wasit.\n\nIn Baghdad\u2019s Sheikh Zayed Hospital, a medic said that Shiite militiamen were monitoring arrivals of wounded people as well. Some Shiite militias function as part of Iraq\u2019s security forces and have also drawn the ire of protesters.\n\nAD\n\nIn one instance, the medic said, gunmen shot at an ambulance to prevent the patient from reaching brain surgery.\n\nA sense of anxiety was palpable across Baghdad on Friday as streets remained eerily quiet and families said they were stockpiling food.\n\nAD\n\nAs the crisis spiraled, masked soldiers fanned out, and helicopters circled low. The troops used barbed wire to block arterial roads where protests had taken place the night before.\n\nIraq\u2019s Internet blackout was temporarily lifted in time for Abdul Mahdi\u2019s speech, and the prime minister asked demonstrators for patience.\n\nThere are \u201cno magical solutions\u201d to problems plaguing the oil-rich country, he said.\n\nHe told protesters Friday that the government has heard their \u201clegitimate\u201d demands, but he compared security measures imposed to quell this week\u2019s violence to a \u201cbitter medicine\u201d that must be taken.\n\nIraqis took advantage of the brief period back online to share footage of the violence on social media.\n\nAn hour later, the connection was cut once again, and by midafternoon Friday, the crowds across Baghdad and southern cities were growing.\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news\n\nAD", "description": "Iraqi security forces are conducting a crackdown that has left at least 35 civilians dead and more than 1,250 wounded since Tuesday.", "authors": ["Louisa Loveluck", "Reporter In The Washington Post'S Beirut Bureau", "Focusing On Syria.", "Mustafa Salim"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ocafPgBkymqpNTpamTjwASxnn_A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3QWYNZHGVEI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
