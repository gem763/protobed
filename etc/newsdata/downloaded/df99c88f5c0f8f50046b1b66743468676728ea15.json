Biden often touts his time in the Obama administration, while Sanders points to his past as a civil rights advocate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhat they're really trying to make the case is about age. And with age comes experience, with experience comes wisdom, and with wisdom comes judgment,\u201d Biden told CBS in an interview set to air Sunday when asked about concerns that he would be able to go toe-to-toe with Trump at a debate.\n\nDuring a press conference in Iowa on Friday, Sanders said that \"the ideas that I am fighting for now didn\u2019t come to me yesterday.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on more picket lines, I expect than all my opponents combined over the last 30 years,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHaving a long record gives people the understanding that these ideas that I am talking about \u2013 they are in my guts. They are in my heart,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is who I am as a human being, and it ain\u2019t gonna change.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates, who would each be the oldest president ever at the start of their terms, have sought to reassure voters they have the capacity to see their campaigns through to the general election and beyond.\n\nYet despite their defenses, both candidates appear to have room to improve with voters who remain concerned about their ages.\n\nTwenty-eight percent of likely early-state Democratic primary and caucus voters said Biden is too old to effectively serve as president, and 43 percent said the same of Sanders in an October CBS News/YouGov poll.\n\nWarren, who is 70 years old and is the other top-three primary contender, was able to keep that figure down at 4 percent.\n\nWhile questions about Biden and Sanders\u2019s age have percolated among voters, a debate about the two septuagenarians\u2019 fitness for office has barely registered as a concern in remarks among the 2020 primary candidates.\n\nThe issue of age was pushed into the spotlight this month after Sanders was forced off the campaign trail before the latest Democratic debate due to a heart attack, while Biden also swatted back at rivals who went after him in a debate in September.\n\nDuring that debate, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro was seen as taking a below-the-belt shot at the former vice president by insisting that Biden contradicted himself when he said some people would have to buy into a health care plan under his proposed system.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you said just two minutes ago?\u201d Castro asked Biden, sparking gasps in the crowd.\n\nExperts have warned that going negative against either candidate could backfire, pointing that while concerns exist, Biden and Sanders continue to have enough support to poll at or near the top of almost every survey.\n\n\u201cIf you go really negative, people are going to remember you and they\u2019re not going to like you,\u201d Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004, told The Hill last month. \u201cThese people are at the top of the polls because people like them.\u201d", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/bidenjoe_sandersjoe_102519getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
