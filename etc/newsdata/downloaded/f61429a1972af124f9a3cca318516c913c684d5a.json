We don\u2019t have all the answers yet, but there\u2019s sufficient information to start putting pieces together for a broader picture.\n\nFacebook coin: what do we know so far?\n\nFacebook blockchain is supposed to be a cryptocurrency-powered payments system fueled by its native cryptocurrency. The Facebook coin will be a stablecoin pegged one-to-one to the United States dollar.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Facebook wanted to tap into the mobile payments sector by integrating them into its social media apps like Whatsapp, Instagram, Messenger, and Facebook. Its early attempts to do so date back to 2015 when the firm announced plans to add mobile payments feature to the Messenger app. However, it was January 2018 when Mark Zuckerberg first suggested that Facebook is going to consider how to use cryptographic encryption and cryptocurrencies in its services. In his words:\n\n\u201cThere are important counter-trends to this --like encryption and cryptocurrency \u2014 that take power from centralized systems and put it back into people's hands. But they come with the risk of being harder to control. I'm interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services.\u201d\n\nLater in May 2018, there were the first rumors stating that Facebook began to form a team dedicated to blockchain and cryptocurrency. Former PayPal president and VP of Facebook\u2019s Messaging Products David Marcus was appointed as a head of the project. At that time, many began to speculate that Facebook plans to launch its own cryptocurrency.\n\nIn June 2018, it was reported that Facebook appointed Evan Cheng as its director of Engineering and Blockchain. This prompted speculations on what Facebook\u2019s crypto plan could be.\n\nThe discussions went silent until December 2018, when Bloomberg published a report about an upcoming stablecoin for WhatsApp users, which led to talks about a \u201cWhatsApp Coin.\u201d The rumor had it that the coin will focus on the remittances market in India.\n\nIn February 2019, it was reported Facebook was already pitching their coin to various cryptocurrency exchanges. The upcoming cryptocurrency will be called the \u201cFacebook Coin\u201d or just \u201cFB Coin.\u201d In related news, Mark Zuckerberg admitted that he\u2019s potentially interested in using blockchain technology as an authentication tool on social networks.\n\nIn April, Nathaniel Popper reported that Facebook is seeking USD 1 billion in external funding for its forthcoming Facebook coin. He also added that the stablecoin will be pegged to a basket of foreign currencies.\n\nUpdate on Facebook's cryptocurrency: Sources tell me that Facebook is now looking to get VC firms to invest in the Facebook cryptocurrency project we reported on earlier this year. I hear they are targeting big sums -- as much as $1b. \u2014 Nathaniel Popper (@nathanielpopper) April 8, 2019\n\nNot long after that, it was published that Facebook has spoken with VISA and Mastercard about its Facebook coin and is reaching out to dozens of other financial firms and online merchants to aid its cryptocurrency-based payments system\u2019s launch. Besides, the project\u2019s secretive codename has leaked - it was called \u201cProject Libra.\u201d\n\nAccording to the latest reports of May 2019, Facebook has hired two Coinbase\u2019s compliance specialists to help the company prepare for the Facebook coin launch in the United States. Also, Reuters reported that Facebook registered a new company called Libra Networks in Geneva, Switzerland. Libra Networks will focus on investing, payments, financing, identity management, analytics, big data, blockchain, and related technologies.\n\nAt the end of May, BBC released an unsourced report which states Facebook will start testing its token named GlobalCoin at the end of 2019 and wants to launch it in Q1 of 2020. The report also mentions Facebook talks with institutions like Bank of England, U.S. Treasury, and Western Union.\n\nDespite many leaks, reports, and rumors, we are yet to get an official statement from Facebook regarding the Libra project. The company still stands behind its latest comment, which says, \u201cFacebook is exploring many different applications of cryptocurrencies,\u201d without revealing much about the use case of Facebook blockchain and Facebook coin.\n\nMark Zuckerberg at F8 Conference. Source: Wikipedia Commons.\n\nWhat could be the purpose of Facebook blockchain?\n\nSo far we got nothing but guesses on what Facebook coin and blockchain could be and what could it be used for. Yet, according to Facebook, soon its 2.4 billion users will be able to discover, browse, and get product recommendations from their favorite influencers, organize shipping and make payments without ever leaving Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp, as reported by The Telegraph.\n\nThe news goes hand in hand with recently announced Facebook\u2019s biggest redesign in a decade. Apparently, Facebook\u2019s website and the app will become more privacy-oriented, geared towards private groups, and with new personalized news feeds. Facebook won\u2019t function as a \u201ctown square\u201d anymore, but more like a \u201cliving room,\u201d was announced it the latest F8 conference. It is likely that Libra Networks and a native Facebook blockchain will play a pivotal role in encrypting user data, identity management, and private conversations.\n\nApart from privacy and security, Facebook\u2019s blockchain is also likely to power its cryptocurrency-based payments system. Such system would enable peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions in all its existing social media platforms and purchases in external ecommerce sites. According to the report by the Wall Street Journal, Facebook may eventually produce a convenient payments' gateway to be embedded within various third-party apps and websites, much like Facebook\u2019s like and login buttons.\n\nProject Libra. Source: MyBitcoin.com\n\nFacebook already has a built-in marketplace dedicated to buying and selling various goods. Blockchain could be used to perform on-platform payments and manage reputation without leaving the platform. Such development could have enormous implications for business pages, too.\n\nThe same applies to Instagram and Whatsapp. In recent years, Instagram has reaped the benefits of thriving influencer marketing and has become a hot spot for every consumer business. Last October the company introduced a dedicated shopping channel designed for businesses on the platform. The ability to list, market, discover, and pay for the products directly on the platform would only bring the sellers and consumers closer.\n\nMeanwhile, Whatsapp has been testing its mobile payments feature in India. For now, the system requires a user to connect his or her native phone number and a bank account that supports Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a real-time Indian payment system used for local inter-bank transactions. Therefore, no cryptocurrency is unlikely to be involved just yet, especially considering India\u2019s harsh stance against all things crypto. Mark Zuckerberg has said the payments product will gradually roll out in other countries later in 2019 so we might witness Facebook cryptocurrency in use then. It\u2019s also not unlikely that WhatsApp will get its own product catalogs, too.\n\nFacebook Marketplace. Source: Facebook Newsroom.\n\nSuch moves hint that Facebook's primary objective is to compete in the ecommerce shopping sector, taking on online giants like Amazon or eBay, as well as online payment companies like PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. Facebook blockchain is likely to be implemented for user payments and to strengthen Facebook\u2019s security, user identity authentication, and privacy.\n\nIn such case, what are the potential use cases for the Facebook coin?\n\nWhat is the potential use case of the Facebook coin (FB Coin)?\n\nSo far, there have been many speculations about what Facebook coin could mean for the social media users and the rest of the world. If the reports are to be trusted, we know that FB Coin is likely to be an externally-funded stablecoin backed by a basket of foreign currencies. The Facebook coin will allegedly maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar.\n\nSuch coin could have several potential use cases:\n\nA Facebook wallet with a Facebook coin used to pay for goods and services from partner merchants or for Facebook, Instagram, or Whatsapp ads.\n\nSending Facebook cryptocurrency to friends to share bills and other expenses Facebook apps (Whatsapp, Messenger, Facebook, and Instagram).\n\nA \u201ccheckout option that users could port around the web.\u201d\n\nSocial media users could be rewarded with fractions of FB Coin for viewing ads.\n\nUsers may be rewarded for their activity (posts, likes, comments) on social networks, much like Steem.\n\nMerchants could be able to reduce transaction fees by using the Facebook coin.\n\nUsers may be able to buy goods directly from advertisers and influencers using the Facebook coin.\n\nThere might be some interesting integrations with VISA and Mastercard payment networks allowing users to convert Facebook coins to fiat with ease.\n\nFacebook wants ecommerce companies and app developers to accept its coin so it may become another online payment gateway.\n\nWill Facebook coin compete with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other open cryptocurrencies?\n\nIt\u2019s doubtful that Facebook will create an open, decentralized ledger. Experts believe that the Facebook coin is going to be a centralized payments system used by stablecoins like Tether (USDT), Circle (USDC), TrueUSD (TUSD) or Paxos Standard Token (PAX). According to Juan M. Villaverde from Weiss Ratings, Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency won't act as a real crypto asset and will act as a blockchain version of PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and credit cards. In his words:\n\n\u201cThe Facebook coin will compete with established payment processors. Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, are built from the ground up to disrupt them.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the company isn\u2019t moving into cryptocurrency space but merely applying blockchain technology to the traditional fintech industry.\n\n\u201cThe Facebook coin will be another layer built atop the existing financial system \u2014 another intermediary, another counterparty, plus all the corresponding risks. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are slated to render every one of those layers obsolete,\u201d says Juan M. Villaverde.\n\nHowever, others think the Facebook coin will be good for crypto adoption, and can potentially increase the legitimacy of the crypto industry. For instance, Spencer Bogart, a partner at Blockchain Capital believes that \u201chaving billions of users, the social media giant Facebook could, in theory, bring digital assets closer to a large number of potential users and could even act as a \u201cdramatic catalyst.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, there also are contrary opinions. For instance, Lisa Ellis, a partner at Moffett Nathanson thinks Facebook might go for an open system governed by an independent board.\n\n\u201cAn open cryptocurrency system is more likely to encourage commerce over the Facebook system than a closed crypto system, because an open crypto is more liquid (easier to exchange to/from fiat currency, so more likely a consumer is willing to use it),\u201d she states, as reported by Barrons.\n\nBesides, Facebook already tried to implement Facebook Credits, a closed payments system which turned out to be a failure. Collaborating with VISA and Mastercard only seems to confirm the theory of Facebook blockchain being another internet gateway like Apple Pay and Google Pay.\n\nYouTuber ColdFusion has also voiced his opinion, expressing further privacy concerns. According to him, the Facebook coin could be huge in the developing markets, but it may also lead to new privacy issues concerning user spending habits and transaction data sharing.\n\n\"While Facebook may say that they want to ensure privacy, historically this has not been the case,\" points out the YouTuber.\n\nYou can see the full video below.\n\nAside from all the opinions and speculations, we are yet to see what the Facebook coin and cryptocurrency will come to be.\n\nBeware of Facebook coin or FB Coin scams\n\nSo far, all that we know from Facebook about the Facebook coin is summarized in the following quote:\n\n\u201cFacebook is exploring ways to leverage the power of blockchain technology. This new small team is exploring many different applications. We don\u2019t have anything further to share.\u201d\n\nRegardless, that doesn\u2019t stop tireless internet scammers from doing what they're good at. There already are multiple websites like Facebooktoken.org, which are organizing a Facebook ICO.\n\nFacebook ICO. Source. Facebooktoken.org\n\nNeedless to say, these are scam websites which are trying to take advantage of naive investors. Be careful and don\u2019t fall for any officially confirmed Facebook ICO.\n\nFollow the latest cryptocurrency news with Cryptonews to keep up with the latest updates on the Facebook coin and The Project Libra.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/guides/0/5ce/2669a2a9fd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
