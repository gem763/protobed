We're all in our early 30s. My boyfriend was always at John's beck and call, and I sense John resents my appearance on the scene. John has asked my boyfriend to host two of John's female friends for a week while they visit our city. They are single and in their early 20s.\n\nI get the very strong impression it is a setup and John is trying to break us up. I feel like I'm being controlling, but I have told my boyfriend I do not want these women to stay with him. I think he would have otherwise agreed but told John the women couldn't stay with him. John has now cut him off completely, and my boyfriend blames me for breaking up their friendship.\n\nEven if I was out of line, I feel if it were truly just about hosting, that would be no reason to end a friendship. I would appreciate your perspective.\n\n\u2014 Girlfriend\n\nGirlfriend: I\u2019m not sure you will.\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis for The Washington Post)\n\nMainly, I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s good you\u2019ve put in only six months on this loser bet.\n\nYour boyfriend blames you for breaking up their friendship? And you\u2019re all in your 30s?\n\nHe couldn\u2019t own his own decision or make a different one if he disagreed with you?\n\nJohn cut off a \u201cbest\u201d friendship completely over this crap show?\n\nYou find it credible that a man would send a hot young breakup squad to his \u201cbest\u201d friend\u2019s home?\n\nYou find it credible enough that this gambit would actually work that you felt compelled to bar the door to it?\n\nThere\u2019s no answer here; there\u2019s just a do-over. These two men are acting like children. You are, if not on their emotional level yourself, putting up with a man who has chosen to act like a child. Please just start over.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t mean with your boyfriend. I mean with this as your new mantra: Choose carefully, trust justifiably, live drama-free.\n\nRe: Girlfriend: I'll take one for the team \u2014 send the hot young breakup squad my way. It will be emotionally draining to be used in such a way, but if it helps out my fellow travelers in life, I will make the sacrifice.\n\n\u2014 Fellow Traveler\n\nFellow Traveler: Tears. I salute your courage.\n\nRe: Girlfriend: I'm unclear on what the country's \"gender inequality and poverty\" has to do with this. Can anyone clue me in?\n\n\u2014 Unclear\n\nUnclear: I noticed that, too, and suspected it had something to do with a culturally ingrained female subservience to men, and I was already so grossed out by the whole thing that I hit a blue error screen in my head. So I punted.\n\nAnd it\u2019s my column, so I can mix whatever metaphors I want.\n\nRe: Girlfriend: A controlling girlfriend has succeeded in cutting her boyfriend off from his best friend and has convinced you to condemn the boyfriend as immature? Nice work if you can get it, I suppose.\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\nAnonymous: Nice interpretation if you can twist it, I suppose.\n\nPlus, I suggested she was just as immature and advised a breakup, exactly what you\u2019d want in your scenario, but, roger.", "description": "Her boyfriend and his best friend are acting like children \u2014 and her behavior doesn\u2019t sound much better.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "September At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
