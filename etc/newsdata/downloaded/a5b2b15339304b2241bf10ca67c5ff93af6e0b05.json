He also announced that the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, would visit the White House.\n\nOn Saturday, airstrikes and shelling continued in Kurdish areas and harrowing scenes among panicked refugees were reported and broadcast worldwide.\n\nCNN reported that earlier this week Gen Mazloum Kobani Abdi, head of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, told a senior US diplomat: \u201cYou have given up on us. You are leaving us to be slaughtered.\u201d\n\nAlso on Saturday, another SDF commander told a press conference: \u201cThe protection of Isis prisons will not remain our priority. The defence of our soil will be prioritised if [the] Turkish military continues its attacks.\u201d\n\nMattis spoke to NBC\u2019s Meet the Press with Chuck Todd in an interview to be broadcast in full on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in a situation of disarray right now,\u201d he said in excerpts released by the broadcaster. \u201cObviously, the Kurds are adapting to the Turkish attacks. And we\u2019ll have to see if they\u2019re able to maintain the fight against Isis. It\u2019s going to have an impact. The question is, how much?\u201d\n\nAsked if the US would regret Trump\u2019s decision, Mattis said: \u201cWe have got to keep the pressure on Isis so they don\u2019t recover.\n\n\u201cWe may want a war over. We may even declare it over. You can pull your troops out as President Obama learned the hard way out of Iraq, but the \u2018enemy gets the vote\u2019, we say in the military. And in this case, if we don\u2019t keep the pressure on, then Isis will resurge. It\u2019s absolutely a given that they will come back.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:17 Donald Trump says Kurds \u2018didn\u2019t help us with Normandy\u2019 \u2013 video\n\nTrump said this week any Isis prisoners escaping from camps guarded by Kurds \u201cwill be escaping to Europe\u201d.\n\nIsis \u2018Beatles\u2019 should face trial in UK, says former director of public prosecutions Read more\n\nHe also said the Kurds \u201cdidn\u2019t help us in the second world war, they didn\u2019t help us in Normandy, for example\u201d.\n\nMattis\u2019s apparent disinclination to directly criticise the president\u2019s words and behaviour over Syria \u2013 which many usually supportive Republicans in Congress have been perfectly happy to do \u2013 is in keeping with his approach since resigning in December 2018.\n\nThe retired US Marine Corps general has said he has a \u201cduty of silence\u201d regarding the president he served. That commitment has held despite Mattis having resigned in response to an earlier attempt by Trump to pull US troops from Syria and in protest at his treatment of America\u2019s allies.\n\nIn September, Mattis published a memoir, Call Sign Chaos. The book skirted his service in the Trump administration, focusing instead on his career in the US armed forces.", "description": "Ex-defense secretary calls resurgence of Isis \u2018a given\u2019 and withdrawal will \u2018have an impact\u2019 on Kurds\u2019 ability to fight Islamic State", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a450b77ce09b72ca0f5f1b3ae0df1c145e2ed50a/0_80_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=10292456b8fbc0e327efe510161fe0f4", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
