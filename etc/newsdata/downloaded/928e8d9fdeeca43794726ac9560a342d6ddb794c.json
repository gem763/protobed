They warned that details could change and the deal could still fall apart before Monday, when opening statements are to begin in the first federal trial to determine responsibility for the opioid epidemic.\n\nThe agreement would release AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson, which together distribute about 90 percent of the country\u2019s medicines, along with Johnson & Johnson and Teva, the Israeli-based manufacturer of generic medicines, from a rapidly growing list of more than 2,300 lawsuits that they face in federal and state courts.\n\nAll of the companies either didn\u2019t return requests for comment or declined to do so.\n\nPennsylvania, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas are leading the talks for the states, along with lawyers for thousands of cities and counties whose cases are in federal court.", "description": "The nation\u2019s three largest drug distributors, as well as two manufacturers, are in negotiations to settle thousands of cases before a trial set to begin on Monday.", "authors": ["Jan Hoffman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/science/16OPIOIDS/16OPIOIDS-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
