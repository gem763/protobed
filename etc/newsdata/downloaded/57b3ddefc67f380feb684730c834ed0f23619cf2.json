Switch banks.\n\nWhen it comes to climate action, it\u2019s easy to feel ineffective as an individual. However, one of the easiest one-off actions we can do is to put our money where our mouth is and ensure we\u2019re not directly funding climate-wrecking industries.\n\nChecking who you bank with and where your superannuation fund sends your money are the two easiest ways you can act on climate change.\n\nIt\u2019s simple. Just check if your bank and super fund are financing the fossil fuel industry. If they are, move your money somewhere it\u2019s going to do some good instead. Check the Market Forces website for more information.\n\nClimate change. If you plan on sticking around on this planet a while, then you\u2019re right to be seriously concerned about it.\n\nYou certainly wouldn\u2019t be alone. The vast majority of Australians are concerned it\u2019s going to lead to more droughts, floods, and water shortages, according to the latest survey by The Australian Institute.\n\nREAD MORE: Why we\u2019re walking off the job to protest climate change \u2013 and why you should too\n\nWhile it\u2019s great that Australians are switched on to the threat climate change poses, it doesn\u2019t do a whole lot of good unless you act on it as well, according to former Greenpeace campaigner Julien Vincent. He left Greenpeace to start Market Forces, an organisation that aims to hold Australia\u2019s financial institutions to account on the environment.\n\n\u201cMost Australians want to see action taken on climate change. But the vast majority are unaware that the custodians of our money, companies like banks and superannuation funds, almost exclusively invest in coal, oil and gas and highly polluting companies,\u201d Vincent told Business Insider Australia.\n\nGiven it\u2019s mandatory for every worker in the country to have a superannuation account, it\u2019s especially incumbent on Australians to know where their money is going.\n\n\u201cBy demanding our retirement savings are kept out of companies that are pushing us towards runaway climate change, or moving to a bank that won\u2019t help the expansion of industries like coal, oil and gas, there is phenomenal potential to decarbonise the economy and push finance investment from polluting industries to their clean replacements,\u201d Vincent said.\n\n\u201cWe still need governments to act but it\u2019s great to know that we\u2019re not limited by that, and can pursue change through our wallets, bank accounts, insurance and super funds.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, this is what you should know to avoid funding the further destruction of this planet.\n\nThe big banks have a terrible environmental track record\n\nGiven their size, it\u2019s no surprise most Australians count themselves as a customer of one of the big four banks \u2014 ANZ, Westpac, NAB and the Commonwealth Bank.\n\nIf your money is with one of them and you care about the environment, however, you find yourself in a bit of a bind.\n\nAll four have publicly championed the Paris Agreement to limit global warming well below a 2-degree Celsius rise. That would be great except that in the three years since, they\u2019ve collectively loaned $21 billion to the coal, oil and gas industry. What\u2019s worse is that the loan value to new fossil fuel projects has actually increased by 50% over that same period.\n\nIn essence, they\u2019ve all failed to live up to their commitments. Here\u2019s how they compare.\n\nMarket Forces How the big four have contributed to climate change since December 2015.\n\nDon\u2019t forget either that all four own other banks that go by different names. Westpac owns the Bank of Melbourne, BankSA, RAMS, and St George, while the Commonwealth Bank owns BankWest and NAB owns UBank. If you\u2019re with any of those, your money is with them anyway, just under a different business name.\n\nOther large banks aren\u2019t much better. ING, AMP, Citi, HSBC, Bank of China, and Macquarie have also all loaned hundreds of millions of dollars or more to the fossil fuel industry.\n\nThe Bank of Queensland is the best of all the large banks on this record. Since 2008, it\u2019s only lent $32 million to coal mining. More importantly, it\u2019s since announced plans to reduce coal lending to zero by 2023 and has stated publicly that it \u201chas no exposure to coal-fired power generators and has no appetite for lending to this sector.\u201d\n\nSuncorp Bank is another example. It ceased lending in 2009 and currently has no exposure to any fossil fuel companies via its banking activities. It does, however, have some exposure via its insurance arm.\n\nThose two changes alone demonstrate that financial institutions are receptive to customers and activists who make their voices heard.\n\nFind a bank that isn\u2019t wrecking the planet\n\nWhether it\u2019s a savings account, credit card, loan or mortgage you might have, every dollar is a vote of support for the institution you choose. It\u2019s just a matter of choosing wisely.\n\nWhile all of the names to avoid above seem like an extensive list, they\u2019re really just the tip of the oil-slicked iceberg.\n\nTo name every bank individually that isn\u2019t directly profiting from the fossil fuel industry would take far too long. Some of the biggest names on the good list include ME Bank, Adelaide and Bendigo Bank, Quodos Bank, Rabobank, and Southern Cross Credit Union. They are just some of the bigger names however, with a whole tranche of other institutions to pick from.\n\nSee the full list here on Market Forces website.\n\nSuperannuation funds are a lot less transparent\n\nDespite the fact that we all have to stash our money with one, super funds are notoriously difficult to understand exactly where they then put that money. That\u2019s because many largely don\u2019t disclose their exact exposure to polluting sectors, which is a bit concerning considering they control up to $3 trillion of our retirement money.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t get a clear idea of exactly where those dollars are invested.\n\nAgain, Market Forces have a comprehensive list of each and every fund and what they can tell about them, from whether they exclude fossil fuels from their investments, their track record on voting on climate change and even if they\u2019ve considered how global warming will affect your money.\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to distil a list of exactly who ranks where, it\u2019s clear there are sustainable alternatives out there for you to choose.\n\nAgain, go to the full list, see how yours adds up and consider switching if it\u2019s got a poor rating.\n\nGive your institutions a piece of your mind\n\nWhile the most important thing is to move your money to organisations that are going to use it responsibly, you can do more besides.\n\nIt\u2019s worth contacting your own organisation and telling them why you\u2019re leaving or why you think it should do better on climate change.\n\nIt does make a difference and groups like Market Forces have templates and campaigns if you do want to get involved in activism.\n\nIf you have insurance, you can also check the impact of that fund here.\n\nYou can make a difference\n\nWhen it comes to climate change and other big global issues, it\u2019s easy to think you can\u2019t make an impact.\n\nIf you\u2019re young, lacking money, or influence, it\u2019s reasonable to ask, \u2018what difference is a few thousand bucks really going to make to multi-billion dollar businesses?\u2019\n\nThe answer is that it all adds up and like with anything, it reaches a tipping point. If just those who read this article were to make a switch, millions of dollars would flow out of projects that are currently doing harm. That sends a clear message as to where the money is going, and businesses, by nature, will always follow the money.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
