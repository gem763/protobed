So far, just eight candidates have qualified.\n\nBiden said it was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d that Warren would not delve into the details of her healthcare proposal, drawing a comparison to Trump.\n\n\u201cThe last thing the Democrats should be doing is playing Trump\u2019s game and trying to con the American people to think this is easy. There\u2019s nothing easy about it,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called Biden corrupt since Democrats in Congress opened an impeachment inquiry focused on Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate unsubstantiated charges that Biden improperly tried to aid his son Hunter\u2019s business interests in Ukraine.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren does an interview in the \"Spin Room\" after the conclusion of the fourth U.S. Democratic presidential candidates 2020 election debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio U.S., October 15, 2019.
