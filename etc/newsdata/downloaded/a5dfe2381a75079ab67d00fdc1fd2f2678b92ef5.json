would be an \u201caffront to common sense\u201d not to address this.\n\nBut it reserves most of its criticism for the London Fire Brigade (LFB), which it says failed to educate its firefighters in the dangers associated with combustible cladding systems.\n\nIt also failed to visit the block following the refurbishment to ensure the assessment of the risks it presented was accurate and up to date, the report adds.\n\nCondemning the brigade's \"stay put\" policy, it says this meant dozens of people stayed inside the building rather than evacuating.\n\nThe report describes the measure as an \u201carticle of faith\u201d within the LFB, \u201cso powerful that to depart from it was to all intents and purposes unthinkable\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox

This was \u201cremarkably insensitive\u201d, it says.\n\nThe LFB has been defended by campaigners who argue that it is unfair to pin the blame on the fire service.\n\nOne unnamed source told The Independent: \u201cWhile I welcome the fact that blame has been apportioned to so many different entities, it strikes me as odd that firefighters are named when the companies that produced the materials that led to the fire \u2013 such as Arconic, Cellotex, Rydon, RBKC and its so-called arms-length management organisation the TMO \u2013 are not.\n\n\u201cThe report says a lot but I think it says too much about those who shouldn\u2019t be blamed and too little about those who should be.\u201d\n\nEmma Dent Coad, Labour MP for Kensington, who said the report was blaming those \u201csent to the scene of a crime, when the crime has already been committed\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cFive years of bad decisions, dodgy dealings, possible fraud potentially, all kinds of hideous decisions going on elsewhere \u2013 that built the bonfire around Grenfell. That building had total integrity for 40 years. It had functioned as it was built, and the stay put policy was 100 per cent accurate. The firefighters when they arrived had no idea what has happened, they hadn\u2019t been told, that information wasn\u2019t available. It\u2019s completely obscene.\u201d\n\nSir Martin also highlights a \u201cworrying failure of communication\u201d between the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) and the LFB, which meant there was an \u201cunacceptable delay\u201d between the first request for a dangerous structures engineer on the scene.\n\nThe report also flags up the fact that the RBKC tenant management organisation emergency plan was \u201c15 years out of date\u201d and that RBKC\u2019s response to the fire was consequently \u201cineffective\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cprinciple reason\u201d the fire spread across the 24-storey block so quickly was the aluminium composite material (ACM) rainscreen panels with a flammable polyethylene core, which \u201cacted as a source of fuel\u201d, Sir Martin says.\n\nThis was further accelerated by the insulation boards behind the cladding panels and the window surrounds, both of which had combustible materials, which has also been added during a refurbishment of the building several months before the fire.\n\nIn an analysis of how the blaze started, the inquiry states that it was an \u201celectrical fault in a large fridge-freezer\u201d in Flat 16, and ascertains that Behailu Kebede, the occupant of the flat, will be absolved of any blame for the inferno.\n\nThe report notes that the fire was \u201crelatively minor\u201d and typical of a common kitchen pan fire, stating that a blaze of this size was perfectly foreseeable\u201d.\n\nWhile some affected by the tragedy will welcome the findings of the report, others have described them as \u201crather hit and miss\u201d.\n\nLondon's Metropolitan Police declined to comment on the findings at this stage.", "description": "Fewer people may have died in Grenfell Tower if\u00a0the London Fire Brigade had not stuck so rigidly to its \"stay put\" policy and evacuated people instead, a public inquiry into the blaze\u00a0that killed 72 people has concluded.\u00a0 In a document spanning around 1,000 pages,\u00a0Sir Martin Moore-Bick\u00a0said there\u00a0\"serious shortcomings\" and \"systemic\" failures in its response to the fire.", "authors": ["May Bulman", "Anu Shukla"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/25/22/grenfell-fire-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
