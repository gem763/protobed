The SPD is the junior partner to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) in Germany's ruling coalition.\n\nNearly half of pro-business Free Democrat (FDP) voters, 39 percent of CDU supporters and 28 percent of supporters of the far-right, climate-skeptic Alternative for Germany (AfD) also say the measures don't go far enough.\n\nBut according to the survey, 63 percent of Germans don't think gasoline and diesel should become more expensive than outlined in the climate package, which foresees a rise of \u20ac0.03 per liter from 2021 and between \u20ac0.09 and \u20ac0.15 per liter from 2026.\n\nThe poll also showed most Germans are pessimistic about humanity's chances of fighting climate change. Asked if the world would manage to effectively combat climate change, three quarters of respondents said no.\n\nThe Greens, meanwhile, rose by 3 percentage points from earlier in September to shared first place with the CDU, with both parties polling at 27 percent, according to the poll. The SPD dropped two points to 13 percent, slipping into fourth place behind the AfD at 14 percent.\n\nThe Greens are also by far the most popular party when it comes to climate change policy. Asked which party best represented their favored policy on climate change, 55 percent of respondents said the Greens. The answers \"not sure\" and \"no party\" came in second and third place, respectively, at 14 and 11 percent. The CDU was fourth at 10 percent.\n\nThe Politbarometer polled more than 1,300 voters this week. It has a margin of error between 2 and 3 percentage points.", "description": "Most Germans don\u2019t want to pay more for fuel than outlined in the package, however.", "authors": ["Zia Weise", "Kalina Oroschakoff", "Zack Colman", "Joshua Posaner"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1134184260-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
