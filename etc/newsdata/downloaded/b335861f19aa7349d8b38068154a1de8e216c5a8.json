An intelligence official lodged a whistleblower complaint two weeks after the call, on August 12. The Intelligence Community Inspector General, Michael Atkinson, deemed it \"credible\" and of \"urgent concern,\" and passed the complaint on to acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire.\n\nMaguire did not transmit the complaint to Congress within the required seven day timeframe.\n\nThe White House released a summary of the phone call on September 25, confirming reports that Trump pressed Zelensky to open an investigation into corruption allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nAccording to the memo, the Ukrainian leader asked Trump about military aid to Ukraine, which Trump had frozen in the days leading up to the call. Trump then pressed Zelensky to work with US Attorney General William Barr to probe the Bidens.\n\nTrump has denied that he said anything inappropriate during the phone call.\n\nThe complaint has been declassified and is set to be released to public on Thursday, CNN reported.\n\nHere's what we learned so far about impeachment proceedings, the whistleblower complaint, and Rudy Giuliani's involvement.
