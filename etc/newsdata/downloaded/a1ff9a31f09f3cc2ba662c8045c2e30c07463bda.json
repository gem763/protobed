Luke Shaw, the left back, has returned to training after a hamstring injury but the game is expected to come too soon for him. United are currently 8th in the Premier League, three points behind Arsenal, who have not won at Old Trafford in the league since 2006.\n\n\u201cThe situation [with Pogba] is he finished the game, 90 minutes, fantastic,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cBut he got a knock to his ankle which is very swollen so it was better not to go there [to Manchester] with the team and he's in a race for Monday. A doubt? Yes, that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\n\nAsked if Rashford and Martial would recover from groin and thigh injuries respectively, the United manager added: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put my life on it but that\u2019s part of this game, you work with what you have and we\u2019re looking forward to this game.\n\nMason Greenwood could start after two goals in the last three matches Credit: Getty Images\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cLuke\u2019s back in training today so let\u2019s see how he is. He\u2019s getting there so let\u2019s see how he reacts the next couple of days. He\u2019s been working really hard. We hope to see him before the international break.\u201d\n\nInjuries to key attacking players have left United increasingly dependent on 17-year-old Mason Greenwood, who has scored twice in the past three matches, and raised questions about the decision to offload Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez without bringing in replacements.\n\nSolskjaer said the arrival of Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Harry Maguire in the summer had brought about clear improvement defensively but admitted his side needed to create and score more.\n\n\u201cYou can see how much we've improved defensively,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we put the big money in with Aaron and Harry. We don\u2019t concede many chances, don\u2019t concede too many goals.\n\n\u201cThe other way going forward is where we\u2019ve struggled with injuries, Paul, Anthony, Marcus. We\u2019ve had some bad luck in that respect. It\u2019s about building relationships, it doesn\u2019t help when you lose players.\n\n\u201cThese boys need to get the pattern of play and if you\u2019re half a second quicker with your movement ... sometimes the finishing could be better, it can be frustrating but that\u2019s down to outstanding keepers too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a team improving, evolving, a young team. The culture is there, I see them every single day in training, no attitudes with work rate, desire. Now can we trust ourselves. You can see against Astana and Rochdale they want to impress, do well and maybe they rush their finish at times.\n\n\u201cI never said it was going to be easy this season, I said it many times there are gonna be ups and downs, highs and lows and when we lose a game we have to trust ourselves and what we're doing.\n\n\u201cKeep the eyes on the prize and keep the principles we believe in. Any game in the Premier League is winnable but is also loseable, it's margins, fine margins and sometimes you stand there smiling, happy to have won a game, sometimes angry because you've lost, you've got to portray the right image.\u201d\n\nGreenwood could be in line for his first league start of the season against Arsenal. \u201cIt might be [he starts],\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cHe\u2019s proven when he\u2019s been on the pitch, Astana and Rochdale, that when you get him in the box he\u2019s dangerous.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s pleased me about him is he doesn\u2019t turn down chances to finish. I\u2019m not worried about him at all but we\u2019ve managed him, we can\u2019t just throw him in the deep end all the time. He's proved in those games he\u2019s ready for it, the Premier League. I\u2019ll have the weekend to think about it.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United have been dealt a severe blow ahead of Monday\u2019s game against Arsenal with Paul Pogba a doubt with a recurrence of an ankle injury.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aWqw1c9Tfi5O9CjsGFLQKg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B_JHfR7NOpKXD4FEnk_qwg--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/f158af1806f7b00872bc2df181fade50", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
