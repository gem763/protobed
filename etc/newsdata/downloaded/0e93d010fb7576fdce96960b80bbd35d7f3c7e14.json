(Charles Platiau/Reuters)\n\nThe European Union\u2019s top court ruled Tuesday that Google does not have to extend the E.U.\u2019s \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d rules to search results worldwide, handing the U.S. tech giant a major win as it comes under increasing scrutiny from European regulators.\n\nIn 2014, the European Court of Justice gave E.U. residents more control over what pops up when their names are searched online. The ruling required search engines to delete links to sensitive, embarrassing or out-of-date information upon request. But a French privacy watchdog wanted Google to honor those requests globally \u2014 not just within the bloc or a country, such as on France-specific google.fr, for example.\n\nThe same court ruled Tuesday that Google does not have to remove links to people\u2019s sensitive data beyond the E.U.\u2019s 28 member states. The case offered a lens into how and whether different jurisdictions and their courts can police the Internet. The \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d law also tackles evolving questions about whether people can demand that their data be removed from search engines without interfering with free speech and the public\u2019s right to information.\n\n[Why Europe, not Congress, will rein in big tech]\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, the court said that \u201ccurrently, there is no obligation under E.U. law, for a search engine operator \u2026 to carry out such a de-referencing on all the versions of its search engine.\"\n\nStill, the court said that a search engine operator has to adopt measures that discourage Internet users from venturing outside the E.U. to find sensitive information.\n\nPeter Fleischer, Google\u2019s senior privacy counsel, said in a statement Tuesday that \u201csince 2014, we\u2019ve worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten in Europe, and to strike a sensible balance between people\u2019s rights of access to information and privacy.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see that the Court agreed with our arguments, and we\u2019re grateful to the independent human rights organisations, media associations and many others around the world who also presented their views to the Court,\u201d Fleischer said.\n\nThose who contend the rule should be extended worldwide point out that it is easy to operate outside of country-specific versions of search engines. All it takes, for example, is to hop from google.fr to google.com to locate information that isn\u2019t allowed within E.U. searches.\n\n[E.U. opens antitrust investigation into Amazon over third-party selling]\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, had the support of Microsoft, the Wikimedia Foundation (which owns Wikipedia) and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, among others.\n\nMeanwhile, Google is facing pressure from E.U. regulators. In March, the governing body fined the tech giant about $1.7 billion for advertising practices that the bloc said violated antitrust laws. In 2018, the E.U.\u2019s antitrust commission fined it $5 billion and ordered the company to changes its practices around search and Web browser functions in Android phones. That fine followed a $2.7 billion penalty on Google for how it steered users toward its comparison shopping site.", "description": "The European Court of Justice ruling means Google is not obligated to scrub links to people\u2019s sensitive data beyond the bloc\u2019s 28 member states.", "authors": ["Rachel Siegel", "National Business Reporter", "September At Am", "Rachel Siegel Is A National Business Reporter.
