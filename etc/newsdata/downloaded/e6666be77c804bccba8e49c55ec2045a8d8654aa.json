I have had my ups and downs. I haven\u2019t felt very strong,\u2019 she told The Sun.\n\nSpeaking about the last few years, Angelina said: \u2018We\u2019ve all been a bit in lockdown.\n\n\u2018We all have our difficult times. I didn\u2019t work, the kids needed me at home\u2026 my strength is from my children.\u2019\n\nShe continued: \u2018Anyone who is a parent knows there is a strength within you that grows when you just have to survive anything to be strong enough for them and you have to pull them through anything.\u2019\n\nAngelina and Brad\u2019s eldest son Maddox recently started at university (Picture: Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty)\n\nFor Angelina, who recently reprised her role as Disney villain extraordinaire in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, returning to acting has allowed the activist to see things clearly and positively again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There\u2019s something when you are not feeling very strong where you push yourself and I am so grateful that I have the opportunity to play these kind of characters that pull out every bit of strength and remind me that I can be strong,\u2019 she said, adding: \u2018I guess I am a little bit stronger.\u2019\n\nDespite going their separate ways over three years ago, Angelina and Brad have struggled to finalise their divorce, earlier in October asking the court for more time to allow them to decide how to split their assets.\n\nOne major sticking point in the dispute is thought to be Miraval, a French winery that the pair bought in 2011 with the intention of passing on to their six children.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping they can sort things soon.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
