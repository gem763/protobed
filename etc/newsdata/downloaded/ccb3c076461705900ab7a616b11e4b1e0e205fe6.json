Since Believe's release, countless songs and artists have relied on Auto-Tune \u2014 for better or worse.\n\nWhile some artists use it to fix imperfections, others exploit its robotic output.\n\nKanye West relied on vocal processing for his album 808s and Heartbreaks, while country star Faith Hill incorporated the technology into her crossover hit The Way You Love Me.\n\n\"Believe brought to the pop marketplace the idea of Auto-Tune and vocoder and those effects as a tool to make music sound different than it ever sounded before,\" Thompson said.\n\nBirth of Auto-Tune\n\nDespite its massive popularity, the song had rocky beginnings. Months of tinkering, rewrites and experimentation went into the song, first written in the early '90s by Brian Higgins who became known for his work with Dannii Minogue.\n\nOf the six billed writers, four more, including Cher, are said to have helped.\n\nAs the song came together, Cher and the record's producers, Paul Barry and Mark Taylor, felt something was missing.\n\nAs soon as you heard that song, you knew it was a juggernaut. - Stephen Thompson, NPR music writer\n\nSoftware called Auto-Tune had just come on the market. According to the New York Times, Taylor tried it out and transformed two bars of Believe to give Cher her robotic timbre.\n\n\"He was very, very nervous about giving that version of the song to Cher because she's the singer,\" Thompson said. \"She's going to think, 'Oh my God, why are they changing my voice?'\"\n\nBut she loved it and knew she had something special on her hands. Her label, Warner Music, disagreed and wanted a straight vocal track.\n\n\"She's been quoted in newspapers as saying, and I quote, 'You can change that part of it over my dead body,'\" Thompson recalled.\n\nAfter a short battle, the song went to print with a unique sound that was largely unheard by the public at the time.\n\nReady for a hit\n\nBelieve came at a pivotal time for Cher, whose career had been in a slump.\n\nThroughout the '80s and '90s, she had a string of successes, including an Oscar for Moonstruck in 1988 and her hit If I Could Turn Back Time released a year later.\n\nBut when her 1995 album of rock ballads, It's a Man's World, fell flat with fans, Warner Music looked to reinvent the artist.\n\n\"She hadn't hit the Top 40 since 1991 and she was kind of casting around looking for her next hit and trying to figure out where to even go artistically,\" Thompson said.\n\nThe label focused their energy on appealing to her gay fan base, but once Believe hit CD players, her new sound had a wide appeal.\n\nSinger Cher was one of the first musicians to embrace the use of Auto-Tune technology on her 1998 single Believe.

Britney Spears' ...Baby One More Time was released just days later, and Monica's The First Night was number one on the Billboard 100 the week it hit airwaves.\n\nStill, Believe struck a chord with listeners and became a radio staple in early 1999.\n\n\"As soon as you heard that song, you knew it was a juggernaut,\" Thompson said.\n\nTo hear more from Stephen Thompson, download our podcast or click the 'Listen' button at the top of this page.", "description": "In 1998, Cher needed a comeback hit.
