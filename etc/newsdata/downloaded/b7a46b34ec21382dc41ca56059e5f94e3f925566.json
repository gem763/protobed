sleeping in the same bedroom as legend John Lennon used to.\n\nThe house where the music great lived as a child has now been converted into an AirBnB rental.\n\nIt will soon be taking booking and guests will want to get in quick with fans sure to be desperate to walk the same halls as he did before finding fame with the group.\n\nThe Grade II listing building on Liverpool's Allerton Road was owned by George Smith - the husband of Lennon's Aunt Mimi, report the Liverpool Echo .\n\nThe musician stayed at the home as an infant with his mother, Julia and after her death he would frequently visit the house and his family.\n\n(Image: Colin Lane/Liverpool Echo)\n\n(Image: Colin Lane/Liverpool Echo)\n\n(Image: Colin Lane/Liverpool Echo)\n\nAmerican Kelley Kupfer bought the property by chance after wanting to fulfil a bucket list hope after a severe illness.\n\nThe retired nurse suffered from a brain tumour a number of years ago which left her blind for nine months and affected her speech.\n\nAs part of her bucket list, the 60-year-old went on a guided tour and shortly afterwards was told to meet Jackie Spencer - a Beatles expert in the city.\n\nKelley said: \"This journey started for me three years ago and illness which took me a very long time to recover from and initially I lost my sight and it took nine months to get my sight back.\n\n\"My speech was much worse and I would sound like a broken record and say the same thing over and over again.\n\n(Image: Colin Lane/Liverpool Echo)\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\n\"As I was recovering those same things got better and my eyesight came back at that time I said to my husband I don\u2019t know if this is going to happen again or what the future holds but I would really like to embark on fulfilling my bucket list.\n\n\"So that\u2019s how it all began I wanted to go back to places I had been and always wanted to go back to and wanted to visit places that I hadn\u2019t been or wanted to visit.\"\n\nAfter a guided tour of Liverpool's top Beatle's hotspots, Kelley wondered why nobody had started an AirBnB to let people into the homes.\n\nIt was then in 2016 the property went on the market for a cool \u00a3325,000 with Whitegate\u2019s Woolton branch and the 60-year-old snapped it up.\n\nShe added: \"I was flabbergasted no one has jumped on that and opened one [AirBnB] up.\n\n(Image: Colin Lane/Liverpool Echo)\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n\"The closest thing to it was the Hard Days Night and it is not a true connection - but don't get me wrong I stayed there many times.\n\n\"This just came up and if I had not been so ill, I would never have gone on my travels I would never have come to Liverpool likely and I would certainly never have entertained the thought of purchasing a property here.\n\n\"But it was because of that and going through something like that, that your whole perception of life changes.\n\n\"I never thought I would ever meet John's family and they wanted to visit - they hadn't been here in nearly 50 years.\"\n\nNow in a huge restoration, Kelley has transformed the Grade II listed building with the help of Jackie and Lennon's family - cousin, David Birch and sister, Julia Baird.\n\n(Image: Colin Lane/Liverpool Echo)\n\nDespite not being a particular fan of the Beatles , the retired nurse has filled the house with carefully thought memorabilia and some never seen before pictures provided by Lennon's family.\n\nThe furniture also is set in the way The Beatles ' family had it when they lived there with frames and plaques to explain the artifacts placed around the home.\n\nIn the back garden there is also a soundproof recording studio, where bands and artists can record their songs or just want to chill out and play some tunes.\n\nThe rooms have also been given titles after family members names who lived there.\n\nKelley said: \"Naively after the purchase had gone through I was sitting in the States and I thought I was going to throw a bit of paint on the walls and gets some new furniture and rent it out and put it on Trip Advisor.\n\n(Image: Colin Lane/Liverpool Echo)\n\n(Image: Colin Lane/Liverpool Echo)\n\n\"But as soon as I walked through the door - I was stunned and I thought what have I gotten myself into?\n\n\"But it has become a labour of love and has been my baby - I couldn't have done it without John's family and their blessing.\"\n\nThe home will be listed on Host So Simple - a AirBnB Management in Liverpool in the next couple of days.\n\nHowever, the house will not be taking bookings until later this year.", "description": "Beatles fans will soon be able to stay in the historic Liverpool three-bed where the music icon grew up", "authors": ["Olivia Williams", "Sam Elliott", "Image", "Colin Lane Liverpool Echo", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Mirrorpix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20564437.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-Childhood-home-of-John-Lennon-in-Woolton-which-is-ready-to-be-rented-out-as-an-AirBnB-Photo-by.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
