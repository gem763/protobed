We\u2019ve got a list of people and we know who we will be talking to.\u201d\n\nRA has promised a thorough review of what pundits branded Australia\u2019s worst-ever World Cup campaign culminating in a comprehensive defeat by England, and the governing body has plenty to ponder as it sifts through the rubble of Japan.\n\nAlthough taking the Wallabies to a surprise final at the 2015 World Cup in England, Cheika\u2019s stormy premiership produced only a 50% win rate.\n\nRA reviewed Cheika\u2019s position last December after Australia\u2019s worst season in decades but opted to retain him and instead fire forwards coach Stephen Larkham.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would think that we have been satisfied with the results (since the last World Cup),\u201d Castle said. \u201cI think it has been a very challenging time.\u201d\n\nRA Director of Rugby Scott Johnson will lead the review, though he was on the Wallabies\u2019 selectors panel which drew criticism from fans throughout the World Cup.\n\nJohnson has said Australia\u2019s next coach will be decided on merit rather than nationality.\n\nHaving seen the running rugby of Cheika\u2019s Wallabies dismantled in Japan by more tactically astute Wales and England coaches, some Australian fans will hope Johnson means to secure a foreign appointment unburdened by any sense of obligation to the country\u2019s tradition of pursuing success with ball-in-hand.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way Aussies want us to play,\u201d said Cheika.\n\nMost, however, would not miss running rugby nor condemn the coach that ditches it, if it meant a deeper run at the next World Cup.", "description": "With the meek quarter-final exit from the Rugby World Cup marking the definitive derailment of Michael Cheika's roller-coaster tenure as Australia coach, the Wallabies are moving quickly to secure a replacement.", "authors": ["Ian Ransom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443228232&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K09F", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
