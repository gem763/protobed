The top five importing countries are the US, Spain, Russia, China and Canada.\n\nThe release time, in other words, the minimum time between releasing these lions from captivity onto the hunting farm and the actual trophy hunt varies considerably across South Africa's nine provinces.\n\nThe North West has the shortest release time, only four days, and no minimum hunting camp size. The Free State follows with a release time of 30 days and a prescribed hunting camp size of at least 10 000 hectares per 10 lions.\n\nIt is, therefore, no surprise that the vast majority of hunting farms can be found in these two provinces, says Four Paws.\n\nWhat is 'canned hunting'?\n\nIn 1997, the Cook Report, a British TV investigative documentary series, exposed the captive lion breeding industry in South Africa and introduced the phrase \"canned lion hunting\". The term is used for the commercial shooting of captive-bred and often habituated big cats in fenced-off and confined enclosures on private hunting farms, where the animal has little to no chance of escape.\n\nCanned hunting increases the chance to successfully kill the trophy animal in the shortest amount of time possible and is especially popular with less experienced hunters. In some cases, the big cats are drugged to make it even easier for the hunter to hit the target.\n\nProponents of this kind of trophy hunting often use terms such as \"ranch hunting\", \"captive hunting\" or \"put-and-take hunting\" instead of the tainted canned hunting term.\n\nHowever, this is all semantics, as they all describe the same kind of trophy hunting that doesn't involve \"fair chase\".\n\nWhat is 'fair chase'?\n\n\n\nFair chase is a term, used by professional hunting associations, to describe a type of trophy hunting that involves wild animals exhibiting natural behaviour and that takes place in large areas with plenty of chance for the animals to escape.\n\nFair chase, described by Safari Club International, includes minimum criteria such as:\n\n- The animal(s) hunted must have freely resided on the hunting property for at least six months;\n\n- The hunting property needs to provide escape cover that allows the animal(s) to elude hunters for extended periods and multiple occurrences;\n\n- The animal(s) hunted must be part of a breeding herd residing on the hunting property;\n\n- The animal(s) hunted must exhibit their natural flight/survival instincts; and\n\n- No zoo animals, exhibited animals or tame animals are to be hunted.\n\nCriticism from within the trophy-hunting industry\n\nIn November 2017, the Professional Hunters' Association of South Africa (Phasa) passed a motion in support of the hunting of captive-bred lions, reversing its previous position in 2016.\n\nThis resulted in a split in the organisation and many prominent members decided to leave Phasa to form the Custodians of Professional Hunting and Conservation South Africa, which remains opposed to the practice.\n\nSeveral high-profile international hunting organisations also cut links with Phasa over this issue. In the US, both the Dallas Safari Club and Safari Club International subsequently issued statements opposing the practice of hunting of captive-bred lions, or in other words, canned hunting.\n\nALSO READ: Lions bred just to be killed, say animal welfare organisations on World Animal Day\n\n- Compiled by Riaan Grobler", "description": "Many big cat cubs that are exhibited and petted at many wildlife facilities end up being killed as a result of canned hunting.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2600/533917b7ef204bf49f4b194c9c54f600.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
