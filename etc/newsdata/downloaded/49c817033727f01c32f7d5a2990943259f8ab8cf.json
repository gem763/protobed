What happens if he\u2019s gone?", "language": "en", "text": "The U.S.-Israel relationship is deep, broad and multifaceted. It comprises security, economic, technological and societal components. It is more than just the personal ties between our leaders. And yet, in the past decade, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has become a larger-than-life figure whose personality and presence dominates our two nations\u2019 relations. The longest-serving prime minister in Israel\u2019s history, Netanyahu has led the country since 2009 (in addition to three years in the late 1990s). But his attempt to secure a fifth term with early elections in April backfired, leading to a deadlock then and an inconclusive draw in this week\u2019s rerun of the vote, one he may not survive.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate how much Netanyahu has made diplomacy about personality during his tenure. Arriving in the United States as part of his traveling party, as I often did while serving as U.S. ambassador to Israel, was a bit like being in the entourage of a rock star.\n\nThe camera bulbs flashed. Prominent Americans from politics, business and communal leadership sought audiences with him. Famous news anchors lined up to interview him. And the visit was usually capped off by a bravura performance from a famous stage: a speech at the United Nations, in Congress or before a convention hall full of supporters.\n\nIsraelis cheered for Trump. But they may miss Obama more than they expected.\n\nHis oratorical skills are legendary. His English, honed during his high school years in Philadelphia and early professional stints in Washington and New York, is unaccented and idiomatic. He knows his brief inside and out, as one would expect of a man who has spent decades thinking about the challenges to his country\u2019s security and the pathways for its success. Small talk does not interest him. He is relentlessly on message.\n\nFor Israelis, that doggedness has been the key to Netanyahu\u2019s political success. The country faces serious, even existential threats. It\u2019s constantly in the news. It\u2019s one of the United States\u2019 closest partners, in a region where that role has gotten more and more complicated. The Israeli people appreciated that Netanyahu engaged in tireless advocacy on the world stage on their nation\u2019s behalf.\n\nBut the magnetic pull around him sometimes struck me as extreme. In one visit during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, there was a luncheon in the Cabinet Room of the White House after a meeting in the Oval Office. On the Israeli side of the table, Netanyahu was flanked by a few fairly anonymous aides. Across from him sat the president of the United States, the vice president, the secretary of state, the secretary of defense, the national security adviser, the White House chief of staff and an assortment of senior envoys. There was no division of labor. Unlike most world leaders, every senior U.S. official felt it important to be in his orbit.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just needing to be in his presence or engage him in conversation or debate. Netanyahu\u2019s personality defined so much of our relationship. Would he take risks for peace with the Palestinians? How would he handle his challenging coalition politics? Would he strike Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities? How far would he insert himself in U.S. domestic politics?\n\nThese questions often dominated internal U.S. policymaking discussions. In the Obama years, entire national security sessions would be devoted to armchair psychology, focused on how we could get Netanyahu to budge on a minor concession in peace talks, how to convince him he could survive the political risks of doing so, or how to manage his at-times prickly personality to avoid blowback over disagreements, whether personal, rhetorical or policy-focused. (His speech to Congress against Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear deal in 2015 was all three.)\n\nSome of my colleagues in the administration found him frustrating, and with serious disagreements between us, tensions rose on both sides. The more time I spent with Netanyahu as ambassador, the more I realized how much energy we in the U.S. government were wasting on these mind games. On the one hand, he was the leader of a close ally with whom the United States has much in common, cooperates deeply and advances many common interests. The Israeli people\u2019s choice of him as their prime minister deserved our respect. But he was also a political actor in a different county, whose interests at times diverged from ours, and he was unlikely to be swayed by us on matters he considered essential to his country or to his own fortunes. We could have all benefited from less drama.\n\nHow to tell when criticism of Israel is actually anti-Semitism\n\nThose were the difficult years of the Obama-Netanyahu relationship (which echoed similar troubles with President Bill Clinton during Netanyahu\u2019s first term in the 1990s). More recently, Netanyahu has emerged as one of President Trump\u2019s closest international partners. Their mutual admiration is deep, and it has kept Netanyahu prominent in the American public eye, defending Israel\u2019s interests and highlighting areas of agreement with Trump.\n\nBut he has also earned the ire of those Americans who define Trump as a uniquely dangerous figure in U.S. history and see Netanyahu\u2019s exaggerated embrace as going beyond necessary, good working relations with the president and amounting to an endorsement in the U.S. political arena. Now it appears Trump\u2019s return embrace is waning: After open attempts to help Netanyahu win in April, Trump\u2019s ardor has cooled. On Wednesday, he offered a very un-Trumpian take on the Israeli election draw, ignoring his friend and saying, \u201cOur relationship is with Israel.\u201d\n\nIf indeed this iconic leader, such a fixture on the world stage, will soon pass from the scene, it will affect the conduct of U.S.-Israel relations. There is no other figure in Israel \u2014 and certainly none among his likely successors, whether from his Likud party or from the opposition Blue and White \u2014 who could approach the job of prime minister in quite the same way, as far as the United States is concerned.\n\nNone have Netanyahu\u2019s skills as a speechmaker, his native-level English, his supreme (if, at times, dated) confidence in his knowledge of U.S. society, his network of contacts among American elites, his willingness to play in U.S. politics to advance Israel\u2019s interests. None are as recognizable to the general public, and none will inspire the outsize love or the deep antipathy that Netanyahu elicits from different audiences.\n\nThe change could, in fact, be healthy. It could reduce the Israeli prime minister to realistic dimensions in the U.S.-Israel relationship. Ties between Netanyahu\u2019s successor and Trump could certainly be warm \u2014 always desirable between the leaders of two allies \u2014 without being overpowering. The Israeli prime minister could become a less controversial figure \u2014 maybe even an afterthought \u2014 in U.S. politics, sustaining close, cordial ties to members of both parties and moving past the strains with Democrats that emerged around the Iran deal and have continued under Trump (with encouragement from the White House). This leader might build ties in the younger, diverse America beyond the New York- and Washington-based think tanks and television studios that Netanyahu has felt at home in since the 1980s.\n\nSuch an Israeli prime minister would still, appropriately, be a fierce advocate for Israel\u2019s interests. Our countries will remain close partners in many fields, supporting each other\u2019s security. We will also face some of the same disagreements and dilemmas that we currently face, on issues such as how to sustain and advance prospects for a two-state solution with the Palestinians.\n\nA lower-profile Israeli leader will not lessen our cooperation, but it may make it easier to manage our differences in healthier proportions, with the U.S.-Israel relationship conducted by leaders on good terms, supported by professionals, without the dramatic highs and rancorous lows that have been such common features of the Netanyahu years.\n\nSometimes, boring is good.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump sees all Jews as Israelis because his Christian Zionist allies do, too\n\nTrump keeps pushing anti-Semitic stereotypes. But he thinks he\u2019s praising Jews.\n\nAnti-Semitism doesn\u2019t bother Benjamin Netanyahu if it comes from his political allies", "description": "After a decade, a change could be coming.", "authors": ["Daniel Shapiro", "Daniel Shapiro Is A Distinguished Visiting Fellow At The Institute For National Security Studies At Tel Aviv University.
