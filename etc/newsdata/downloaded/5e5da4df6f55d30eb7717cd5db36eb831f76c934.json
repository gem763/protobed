The emails to the captain, first reported by the Financial Times, were among about a dozen similar communications Hook had with other captains in recent months.\n\nBritain said it had summoned the Iranian ambassador to condemn Iran\u2019s actions and would raise the issue at the United Nations later this month.\n\n\"Iran\u2019s actions represent an unacceptable violation of international norms,\" the statement said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by William James, additional reporting by Timothy Gardner in Washington; editing by Elizabeth Piper and Tom Brown)", "description": "Britain's foreign minister on Tuesday said Iranian tanker Adrian Darya had sold its crude oil to the Assad regime in Syria, breaking assurances it had given not to sell crude to the country.
