Negotiations haven\u2019t gone anywhere, and in September, President Donald Trump announced his administration would seek to revoke California\u2019s congressionally granted authority to set standards that are stricter than those issued by federal regulators.\n\nThe automakers decided to intervene in the lawsuit over the issue of California\u2019s right to set standards. By intervening, the automakers changed their stance to siding with the Trump administration against the state. The automakers\u2019 group, called the \u201cCoalition for Sustainable Automotive Regulation,\u201d also includes Nissan 7201, +2.34% , Hyundai 005380, +0.82% , Kia 000270, +3.53% , Isuzu 7202, +1.86% , Maserati, McLaren, Aston-Martin and Ferrari.\n\n\u201cThe certainty of one national program, with reasonable, achievable standards, is the surest way to reduce emissions in the timeliest manner,\u201d said John Bozzella, CEO of Global Automakers and spokesman for the coalition. \u201cWith our industry facing the possibility of multiple, overlapping and inconsistent standards that drive up costs and penalize consumers, we had an obligation to intervene.\u201d\n\nBozzella said that the group made the decision to intervene on how the standards should be applied. That was even though the group wanted more environmentally friendly standards than the only proposal released so far by the Trump administration. \u201cThere\u2019s a middle ground that supports year over year increases in fuel economy,\u201d and promotes electric cars and innovation, he said.\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed freezing the standards at 2021 levels through 2025. A final proposal is expected by the end of the year. Many automakers have said they support increasing the standards, but not as much as those affirmed in the waning days of the Obama administration in 2016.\n\nUnder the Obama administration requirements, the fleet of new vehicles would have to average 30 mpg in real-world driving by 2021, rising to 36 mpg in 2025. Currently the standard is 26 mpg.\n\nThe Trump administration contends that freezing the fuel economy standards will reduce the average sticker price of new vehicles by about $2,700 by 2025, though that predicted savings is disputed by environmental groups and is more than double the EPA estimates from the prior administration. The administration says the freeze would make the roads safer by making newer, safer cars more affordable.\n\nEnvironmental groups say the figures don\u2019t include money consumers would save at the gas pump if cars got better mileage. A study released by Consumer Reports in August found that the owner of a 2026 vehicle will pay over $3,300 more for gasoline during the life of a vehicle if the standards are frozen at 2021 levels.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s authority to set its own, tougher emissions standards goes back to a waiver issued by Congress during passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970. In 2007, when Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor, President George W. Bush\u2019s administration denied California\u2019s bid to place first-in-the-nation greenhouse gas limits on cars and trucks. But the state asked the EPA to reconsider its decision, and in 2009 \u2014 when Democratic President Barack Obama took office \u2014 the feds granted California\u2019s request.\n\nCalifornia has 35 million registered vehicles, the most of any state. A dozen other states and the District of Columbia also follow California\u2019s fuel economy standards.", "description": "General Motors, Fiat Chrysler , Toyota and many others in the auto industry are siding with the Trump administration in a lawsuit over whether California has...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HE384_traffi_ZG_20190221165250.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
