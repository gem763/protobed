Jamila revealed that the pipes on a plane are only cleaned four times a year, so ordering hot beverages like tea or coffee is not the most hygienic decision\n\nWhile it is unknown what airline Jamila works for, the video went viral again earlier this week when it was shared on Instagram.\n\nInside Edition revealed that airlines are only required to disinfect the water tanks four times a year.\n\nFlight attendant's tips for traveling on planes Don't order hot beverages\n\nBring your own blanket and pillow\n\nClean your tray with wet wipes\n\nBe nice\n\nStore your own baggage\n\n'The thing about the coffee and tea, the pipes are rarely cleaned,' Jamila told the outlet, as she added that you'll likely never see an off-duty flight attendant order a warm beverage when they fly themselves.\n\nAnother thing you'll probably never witness them doing? Using the provided blankets and pillows during long-haul flights.\n\n'These get washed, but we're not sure how great they get washed,' Jamila said pointing to the standard issue blankets.\n\nAs for the pillows? 'They take the off the lining and wash it, but the pillow inside is still dirty,' Jamila said, virtually squirming at the thought of the germs.\n\nWhen it comes to germs, another thing to consider is the tray at your seat and how unclean it is by the time you board a flight.\n\nBYOB! Bring your own blanket, that is, as Jamila shared that while the blankets are washed, she's not sure how thorough the cleaning process is\n\n'This is disgusting,' Jamila said. 'When cleaners come on they don't have time to wipe down every individual tray so it's best to bring wet wipes.\n\n'Please bring them on, please clean off your trays before you put anything on here,' she said.\n\nIf you've ever wondered why flight attendants take so long to pour your soda order, it might be because you requested a Diet Coke.\n\nJamila showed that the carbonated drinks takes so much longer to pour because it fizzed up while in the cabin.\n\n'I don't know what it is about the chemistry in Diet Coke and us being 40,000 feet in the air. By the time we pour it, we could have three other drinks poured,' she claimed.\n\nTo be safe: The flight attendant also advised passengers to bring wet wipes on board in future, as the trays are barely given a once over in between services\n\nIt's a mystery: Jamila proved just how much Diet Coke fizzes up when in the cabin, hence your soda order can take quite a while\n\nJamila advised passengers to refrain from asking flight attendants to help store their baggage - as their shift technically does not start until the door of the plane closes before takeoff.\n\nNot only are they not paid to assist passengers with bags, but if something falls and they are injured, there's nothing a flight attendant can do about it as they were not technically supposed to be working.\n\nBe nice! Jamila's golden rule is a simple one; be nice to your flight attendants and you will be rewarded in return\n\nAnd as for her golden tip? Just be nice.\n\n'We're more likely to help you find a better seat if you're nice to us,' she said. 'And maybe an extra drink. Or two!'\n\nIn a statement to Inside Edition, A4A (Airlines for America), confirmed that the water they use 'is the same water source used throughout the airport, including for water fountains and restaurants, and delivered to homes, businesses and local communities each and every day.'\n\nThe statement continued, 'Airlines work closely with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure that water received from municipalities is safe and to maintain that safety by following rigorous sampling and management requirements, which include disinfection and flushing of the aircraft water tanks on a schedule required by regulation.'\n\nWhen the video was shared on YouTube, commentors were pretty grossed out about the water pipe revelation.\n\n'Good thing I only had tea once on a plane..& I\u2019ll definitely bring wipes next time I fly,' said one user.\n\n'My mother taught me to never order tea or coffee in places like these they grow bacteria like crazy,' said another.", "description": "Flight attendant Jamila Hardwick revealed her tried-and-tested tricks for a germ-free in flight experience, including the shocking reason why you should never order hot drinks.", "authors": ["Freya Drohan For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/21/19459524-0-image-a-134_1570565283506.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
