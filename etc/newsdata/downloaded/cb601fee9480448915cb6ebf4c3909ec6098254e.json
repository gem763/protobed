He has resisted pressure from Democrats and watchdogs demanding greater transparency.\n\nBut on Monday, the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance, investigating hush money payments to the pornographic actor Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential election, subpoenaed eight years of Trump\u2019s personal and corporate tax returns, according to media reports.\n\nMazars USA, which prepares Trump\u2019s tax returns, said in a statement that it would \u201cfully comply with its legal obligations\u201d.\n\nDemocrats welcomed the move. The Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a candidate for president, tweeted in response: \u201cOne way or another, we will get Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns.\u201d Another 2020 candidate, Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary under Barack Obama, wrote on Twitter: \u201cThe president is not above the law. The American people deserve to know if he deceived them in hopes of winning an election. He must comply with this subpoena.\u201d\n\nHouse lawmakers sue Trump administration for president's tax returns Read more\n\nA federal investigation into the hush money payments led to Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, pleading guilty to campaign finance violations which, along with tax fraud and making false statements to Congress, resulted in three-year prison sentence.\n\nThat investigation in effect wound up in July. Trump, who denies Daniels\u2019 claim of a sexual relationship, has claimed any payments were a personal matter, not a campaign expense.\n\nBut last month Vance\u2019s office launched a fresh investigation into whether the Trump Organization falsely listed its reimbursement of Cohen for the $130,000 payment to Daniels as a legal expense. This would be illegal under New York law.\n\nVance, who is a Democrat, sent a subpoena to the accounting firm Mazars USA seeking his personal and business returns dating back to 2011, the New York Times first reported, followed by the Associated Press (AP) and other outlets.\n\nThe Times noted that even if the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office were successful in obtaining the president\u2019s tax returns, \u201cthe documents would be covered by secrecy rules governing grand juries, meaning they would not become public unless they were used as evidence in a criminal case\u201d.\n\nA lawyer for the Trump Organization, Marc Mukasey, told the AP he was \u201cevaluating the situation and will respond as appropriate\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s taxes are one of the biggest and longest running controversies of his political career. House Democrats have also subpoenaed them and are currently locked in a legal fight with Mazars USA that could extend into the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSteven Rosenthal, a tax lawyer with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington, told Reuters this year: \u201cI expect Trump will stall at every opportunity \u2026 Delay is a victory for Trump.\u201d", "description": "Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance sent subpoena to accounting firm Mazars USA, which says it will \u2018fully comply\u2019", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/631f9573636258a277341b236745c6fc09d623b1/0_113_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ce794ef50269c3722e957253eb8b5ad2", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
