To WABC. \"He told my mom this is the first time in so long that he's been so happy because he finally found a school where he could be himself with nobody judging him.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Superintendent of Oceanside High School, Dr. Phyllis Harrington, issued a video statement condemning the \u201csenseless act of violence\u201d, imploring parents to monitor their children\u2019s social media activity, and saying that the community would get through this tragedy together.\n\n(MORE: Man allegedly stabs 5 coworkers with folding knife, motive unknown: Tallahassee Police)\n\n\u201cThe kindness and generosity that you model for your children are what makes our community special.
