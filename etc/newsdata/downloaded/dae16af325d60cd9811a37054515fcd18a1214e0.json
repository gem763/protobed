I lost two family members that way and it\u2019s horrible. There\u2019s no comfort or security or peace,\u201d Olivas told TODAY.\n\n\u201cI envision being surrounded by my family somewhere near the water where I can hear the ocean or see it as I\u2019m falling asleep, spending those last moments with the ones that I love most in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be by her side until the very end,\u201d added her husband Jerry Olivas, 47. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy decision, it\u2019s not easy to live with, it\u2019s something I struggle with every day but I understand her position.\u201d\n\nThe couple has been advocating for Nevada lawmakers to pass a \u201cDeath with Dignity\u201d bill, which failed to advance this spring. The Olivas said it should be an option for those who want it, echoing the sentiments of Brittany Maynard, who moved to Oregon to be able to end her own life in 2014 before her terminal brain cancer ran its course.\n\nTroubling symptoms\n\nHanna, a make-up artist who lives in Las Vegas, was diagnosed multiple myeloma \u2014 a blood cancer \u2014 in 2017. It was grim news during a year when the family had already suffered a blow: Hanna had been expecting a child, but lost the baby eight months into her pregnancy.\n\nShe noticed troubling symptoms soon after: pain in her bones, unexplainable fatigue that persisted no matter how much she slept, shortness of breath, \u201csuper bad\u201d night sweats and hair loss.\n\nAt first, doctors were puzzled by her symptoms, suspecting everything from lupus to a hereditary blood disorder. It took experts from the Mayo Clinic and UCLA, plus a local doctor, to finally diagnose the blood cancer. Hanna didn\u2019t fit the profile since typical multiple myeloma patients are over 65, African-American and male.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen so many doctors over the last two years \u2014 I can\u2019t even tell you how many times my blood has been drawn and how many tests I\u2019ve had,\u201d she recalled.\n\nHanna\u2019s treatment options were chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant. But the chemo ravaged her liver and kidneys to the point where she had to stop after five rounds. A stem cell transplant was deemed too risky: \u201cMy whole body just went berserk all at one time,\u201d Hanna said.\n\nThe couple recently visited New York to share their story with a national audience.

Gonzalez-Portillo/Compassion & Choices\n\nWith doctors telling her there was no cure, she began thinking about ending her life before the final stages of the disease.\n\n\u201cMultiple myeloma comes with a very lengthy gruesome painful death. It basically sucks the life out of you. I\u2019ve seen it first-hand,\u201d Hanna said, noting she\u2019s losing a friend to the illness right now.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re on opioids for the pain. You\u2019re so out of it that you can\u2019t even enjoy your quality of life with your family and I don\u2019t want to be like that when that time comes\u2026. It\u2019s my body, my life, my terms.\u201d\n\nPlanning a move to California\n\nShe and her husband had a lengthy conversation about it, Jerry recalled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking, but I think at the end of the day, it\u2019s a matter of choice. I support her decision. I\u2019m not thrilled with it, but my wife is her own person,\u201d he said.\n\nA doctor recently told Hanna she has about a year left, she said. She didn\u2019t accept that prognosis and hoped holistic treatments would help her continue to fight.\n\n\"I envision being surrounded by my family somewhere near the water where I can hear the ocean or see it as I'm falling asleep,\" Hanna Olivas said. Courtesy Patricia A. Gonzalez-Portillo/Compassion & Choices\n\nBut when time runs out, Hanna plans to move to California where the End of Life Option Act allows an adult who has six months or less to live to get a prescription for a life-ending drug. Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, Washington state and Washington. D.C. also allow medical aid in dying, according to Compassion & Choices, a nonprofit that has been publicizing the Olivas\u2019 story.\n\n\u201cYou take the medicine and you fall asleep peacefully,\u201d Hanna said.\n\nShe resented having to move to another state to be able to make that choice, noting it would be a \u201chuge hardship\u201d for her and her husband to leave their home and relocate. So she continues to fight for her home state to offer the option of doctor-assisted death.\n\n\u201cIf Nevada were to legalize it, it would be a huge victory for a lot of terminal patients,\u201d Hanna said.\n\nShe also had a message for other patients with her blood cancer: \u201cTo all my fellow multiple myeloma warriors: Don\u2019t give up the fight. We rise up for a cure together.\u201d", "description": "Hanna Olivas, a terminally ill woman in Nevada, wants doctor-assisted death to be made legal in her home state, but will move to California to end her own life.", "authors": ["A.
