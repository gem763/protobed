(AP) - Mississippi State\u2019s offense appears more comfortable in the Bulldogs\u2019 second season under coach Joe Moorhead.\n\nAfter ranking 10th in the Southeastern Conference in points per game (28.5) and yards per game (397.4) during the former Penn State offensive coordinator\u2019s debut year in Starkville, the Bulldogs have scored 38 points in each of their first two games this year and feature one of the nation\u2019s top rushers in Kylin Hill.\n\nThat offense faces its first real test of the year Saturday when Mississippi State (2-0) hosts Kansas State (2-0).\n\n\u201cI\u2019d just say we\u2019ve improved in the areas we needed to improve the most,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re rushing the ball any differently. But all the things I talked about in the offseason and leading up to the first game about if we pass the ball better, it will help both phases. The better we pass the ball, the more carries we can give to the running back and more explosive we can be in the pass game and spread the ball around.\u201d\n\nThat passing attack has come a long way. Mississippi State is completing 70.6 percent of pass attempts, up from 51.1 percent last season.\n\nPenn State graduate transfer Tommy Stevens has completed 72.5 percent of his passes for 341 yards and four touchdowns. Stevens hasn\u2019t run the ball nearly as often as predecessor Nick Fitzgerald, as he has 37 yards rushing with one touchdown.\n\nStevens opened the Southern Mississippi game with nine straight completions and threw a pair of first-half touchdown passes.\n\n\u201cI think you go into games, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say expecting success,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cBut you definitely want to have good, I guess mojo, to you and be feeling good.\n\n\u201cSo that was the same, just like I guess every other game I\u2019ve played in before. I was happy with the game plan, I felt prepared for what I was going to be given. And overall we were able to execute.\u201d\n\nMississippi State\u2019s improved passing accuracy and consistency has enabled Moorhead to get a little bolder in his play calling.\n\n\u201cWhen you have confidence on every call that is on the sheet and you can call it and believe something positive is going to happen, that allows you to maintain that level of aggressiveness,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cRight now after two games, we feel just as comfortable calling any of the pass plays as we do calling the run plays. That wasn\u2019t the case last year, but now we have confidence that those plays we call will be successful.\u201d\n\nStevens left the Southern Mississippi game with an upper-body injury, leaving his status uncertain for the Kansas State game. Freshman Garrett Shrader took over after Stevens\u2019 injury last week. Junior Keytaon Thompson and redshirt freshman Jalen Mayden are other potential options if Stevens is unavailable.\n\n\u201cWhomever they put out there at quarterback, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s going to be the same formula for success - get the ball in Hill\u2019s hands and be efficient in the passing game,\u201d Kansas State coach Chris Klieman said. \u201cThe quarterback is always going to be a threat running the football.\u201d\n\nKansas State is allowing just 105 yards rushing per game but faces a tough challenge trying to slow down Hill, who ran for 211 yards and two touchdowns in Mississippi State\u2019s 31-10 victory over the Wildcats last season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a difference maker,\u201d Klieman said. \u201cHe\u2019s a phenomenal tailback and can beat you in so many different ways.\u201d\n\nMississippi State is giving Hill more carries this year because it isn\u2019t calling for as many quarterback runs anymore. Stevens isn\u2019t nearly as much of a running threat as former Mississippi State quarterback Nick Fitzgerald, whose 3,607 career yards rushing were the most ever for an SEC quarterback.\n\nHill has responded by rushing for 320 yards to rank second among all Football Bowl Subdivision players, behind only Appalachian State\u2019s Darrynton Evans. He says that Mississippi State\u2019s improved passing creates more opportunities for the running game.\n\n\u201cIt opens things up and it takes the pressure off me and also the offensive line,\u201d Hill said. \u201cIt makes our job way easier when the receivers are opening up the field and catching the ball. So yeah, it just opens up the offense more.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mississippi State's offense appears more comfortable in the Bulldogs' second season under coach Joe Moorhead.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Jones"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/southern_miss_mississippi_st_football_85950_c0-425-3179-2278_s1770x1032.jpg?22e86506c6ba902aa3f0d602fbc0fa74ff5cb9aa", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
