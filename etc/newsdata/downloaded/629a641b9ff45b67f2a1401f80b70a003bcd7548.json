Surgeon removed the bullet from the teen and he was in stable condition in hospital on Wednesday.\n\nPolice Commissioner Stephen Lo said the officer had feared for his life and made 'a split-second' decision to fire a single shot at close range.\n\n'When officers' lives are under threat, [they] can use reasonable force,' said Deputy Commissioner of Police Tang Ping-keung at a press conference today.\n\nThousands of office workers gather at the Central business district in Hong Kong on Wednesday to denounce police shooting of a teenage protester during widespread anti-government demonstrations that marred China's National Day on October 1\n\nProtesters on Wednesday gather outside the entrance of the West Kowloon Court in Hong Kong where some 96 protesters arrested and charged with rioting during clashes with police on September 29 were to make an appearance in court\n\n'His [the officer's] life was hanging on a thin line and there was no other choice to use other types of force or other types of weapons,' Mr Tang added.\n\nHe said the officer had fired at his chest to immobilise the youth quickly.\n\nMr Tang denied that police had been given permission to shoot to kill. He said the officer's action was in line with international procedures, but that police would mount an in-depth investigation.\n\nHong Kong's government said the widespread rioting on Tuesday was 'planned and organised' and called on parents and teachers to help restrain young protesters.\n\nChina's state media has defended the police shooting as 'totally legal and appropriate'. In a commentary today, state news agency Xinhua once again blamed the city's unrest on unidentified 'manipulators'.\n\nHong Kong office workers and high-school students today turned out in their hundreds under a sweltering midday sun to denounce the police officer's act during the most violent clashes in nearly four months of unrest.\n\nThe office workers gathered in Chater Garden in the Central business district as the students - some in the same class as the wounded 18-year-old - demonstrated outside his school in New Territories.\n\nDemonstrators have been urging for an independent inquiry into what they view as excessive violence from the police since June when the unrest first broke out. The city's leader has refused to meet the demand.\n\nOne protester holds a signboard that reads 'disband the police force now' outside the West Kowloon Court on Wednesday\n\nA woman holds up her phone showing an image of a policeman shooting another man at a rally at the West Kowloon Court\n\nSchoolmates of form five student Tsang Chi-kin, 18, place their hands on their chests during a protest at a school in Hong Kong on Wednesday.

They also used water cannon trucks to disperse protesters.\n\nProtesters outside the wounded student's school, the Tsuen Wan Public Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College, chanted 'Free Hong Kong', condemned the police and urged a thorough investigation.\n\n'(It's) ridiculous, it can't happen, and it should not be happening in Hong Kong,' said one 17-year-old who goes to the same school.\n\n'It really disappointed me and let me down about the policeman. I don't know why they took this action to deal with a Form Five student. Why do you need to shoot? It's a real gun.'\n\nSocial media footage captures the moment Tsang (left) was shot by a policeman during a fight in Tsuen Wan on Tuesday\n\nThe teen was shot in the chest by a police officer whose unit had been attacked by demonstrators, said a police spokesperson\n\nAnti-government protesters are detained by riot police during a demonstration in Wong Tai Sin on China's National Day\n\nMotorbikes are on fire after they were hit with a Molotov Cocktail during a protest in Wong Tai Sin on Tuesday\n\nDemonstrators in Central chanted slogans including 'five demands not one less' and sang their unofficial anthem 'Glory to Hong Kong'.\n\nThey also read out a statement together.\n\nPart of the statement read: 'Police confounded black and white for yesterday's shooting incident.'\n\nIt also said: 'We have wisdom and conscience and won't accept government lies and police rule. '\n\nCrowds also gathered outside the West Kowloon Court to voice their anger at police. Some were calling the forces to be disbanded.\n\nNinety-six people, who had been arrested and charged with rioting in relation to clashes with police during rallies on September 29, were to make an appearance in the court today.\n\nProtesters have previously been hit with anti-riot bean-bags rounds and rubber bullets and officers have fired live rounds in the air, but this was the first time a demonstrator had been shot with a live round.\n\nPolice said the officer involved was under serious threat and acted in self-defence in accordance with official guidelines.\n\nStudents show their solidarity with the wounded 18-year-old who was the first person to be shot by police in the unrest\n\nA protester holds up artwork on a placard depicting Tsang being shot in the chest by police during rallies on Tuesday\n\nA schoolmate of Tsang holds a placard that reads 'police mistreat and murder residents' during a protest on Wednesday\n\nA demonstrators place their hand on the chest to show their solidarity during an anti-police demonstration on Wednesday\n\nStudents raise their hands and cover their eyes during a rally on Wednesday in reference to other protesters who were hurt\n\nA spokesperson said the officer fired at Tsang because he feared for his life.\n\n'In this very short span of time, he made a decision and shot the assailant,' police chief Stephen Lo said.\n\nBut protest groups said the officer charged into the melee with his firearm drawn and condemned the increasing use of live rounds.\n\n'The people of Hong Kong are sick and tired of having mere words of condemnation as their only shields against lethal bullets and rifles,' a masked protester said at a press conference near Tsang's school.\n\nWounded student Tsang is seen being taken to hospital by paramedics after being shot in the chest by police on the street\n\nA handout picture shows the injured activist being given first aid before being taken to Princess Margaret Hospital\n\nStudents hold a sit-in outside the secondary school where Tsang studies after the student was shot during demonstrations\n\nAccording to hospital authorities Tsang is in a stable condition after being shot by a police officer yesterday\n\nDemonstrators complain that the officer approached Tsang with his weapon drawn before he opened fire\n\nTuesday's protests, on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, were aimed at propelling the activists' fight for greater democracy onto the international stage and embarrassing the city's political leaders in Beijing.\n\nThe former British colony has been rocked by months of protests over a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial but have evolved into calls for democracy.\n\nThe outpouring of opposition to the Beijing-backed government has plunged the city into its biggest political crisis in decades and poses the gravest popular challenge to President Xi Jinping since he came to power.\n\nHong Kong is ruled under the 'one country, two system' policy and has different legal and governing systems to mainland China. The principle was agreed on by China and the UK before the former British colony reverted to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nHowever, many residents in the semi-autonomous city feel that their freedoms are eroding due to the tight political grip of Beijing.\n\nThe extradition bill was suspended indefinitely by the government in June, but the rallies have morphed into a wider pro-democracy movement that calls for government reforms and universal suffrage, among others.\n\nProtesters are also demanding an independent inquiry into what they view as excessive violence from the police during clashes.\n\nAn anti-government protester is detained by riot police during a demonstration on China's National Day in Wong Tai Sin\n\nAn anti-government protester stops to read a graffitti during a protest on China's National Day in Hong Kong\n\nA black-clad protester walks past flames rising from a fire in Hong Kong after the city witnessed a day of blood and violence\n\nA riot policeman detains an anti-government protester during demonstrations on China's National Day on Tuesday\n\nPolice charge towards protesters in Wan Chai.

Of 96 charged after violence on Sunday, eight were under 18, some were students, others had jobs ranging from waiter, teacher and surveyor to sales manager, construction worker and a hotel employee.\n\nProtesters are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city's affairs despite a promise of autonomy in the 'one country, two systems' formula under which Hong Kong returned to China in 1997.\n\nChina dismisses accusations it is meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up anti-China sentiment.\n\nThe protesters are increasingly focusing their anger on mainland Chinese businesses and those with pro-Beijing links, daubing graffiti on store fronts and vandalising outlets in the heart of the financial centre.\n\nThe Bank of China (Hong Kong) said two of its branches came under attack on Tuesday.\n\n'The bank expresses its deepest anger and strongly condemns this illegal, violent behaviour,' it said in a statement.", "description": "Hong Kong police have defended an officer's decision to shoot a teenager during a clash yesterday, calling the act\u00a0'reasonable and lawful'.
