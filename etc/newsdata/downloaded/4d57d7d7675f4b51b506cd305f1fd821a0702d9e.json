These corporate chicken-hearts include: Apple, American Airlines, Blizzard Entertainment, Coach, Delta Air Lines, Disney, ESPN, Gap, Marriott, Nike, Ray-Ban, Tiffany, Vans, and Viacom.\n\nThat\u2019s only a partial list, but it does at least hint at the disgraceful scale of the rot. Can this really be \"the land of the free and the home of the brave\u201d?\n\nThe heirs of Patrick Henry and Thomas Paine, of Gettysburg and Antietam, of Frederick Douglass and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., of Anzio and Omaha Beach, are using their hard-won freedom to help China hide plain facts from public view: that the Chinese regime is authoritarian and abusive; that it oppresses Tibet and herds religious minorities into reeducation camps; that it is stamping out what remains of liberal institutions in Hong Kong and would like to do the same to the free and independent nation of Taiwan as soon as enough major powers agree to look the other way.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose business \u201cleaders\u201d who have tacitly endorsed Chinese policy are too afraid of losing their access to China\u2019s 1.4 billion consumers, or its marvelously cheap and efficient supply chains, to bother about any of that. And in fairness, they do have a duty to protect shareholders\u2019 investments and to increase their value if possible, and therefore arguably have no moral obligation to stand up for liberty.\n\nThat may be a fundamental indictment of American capitalism, as many have suggested over the past few days. But one can never indict \u201cmarkets\u201d without implicating millions of co-conspirators: the shareholders and consumers who will keep buying the companies\u2019 shoes and watching their movies and attending their games no matter how eagerly they parrot the Chinese Communist Party line.\n\nThe rich world is still a much more valuable market for these companies than even 1.4 billion consumers with low to moderate incomes. If the public had ever demanded that they stand up for liberty, they\u2019d have quickly become champions of freedom. But we won\u2019t, so they don\u2019t.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConservatives similarly have a point when they mock \u201cwoke capitalists\u201d who take stands on America\u2019s culture wars while ignoring the vast scale of Chinese human rights abuses. But those critics crying \u201chypocrisy\u201d are also mostly lining up behind President Trump \u2014 that fan of dictators everywhere. Who responded to the Hong Kong protests by saying Beijing had acted \u201cvery responsibly\u201d and \u201cHong Kong is a part of China, they\u2019ll have to deal with that themselves.\u201d If you call them on it, their reply is likely to echo the implicit message from those gutless companies: They have other priorities \u2014 in this case, winning the culture wars. In complaining about corporate hypocrisy while embracing their own double standard, they are, in other words, no better than the rest of us.\n\nMuch talk in recent days has focused on what the NBA fiasco reveals about capitalism, or about Chinese penetration of U.S. institutions, but the real revelation is about who we are. If there\u2019s any hope, it\u2019s that we\u2019ve met the news with outrage, so we apparently want, and maybe even intend, to be better than that.\n\nAnd if we do want to be that better nation, the one that believes in liberty and justice for all, then we\u2019ll make one thing clear from now on: Companies can serve either the Chinese Communist Party or the American consumer, but never both.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Can this really be \"the land of the free and the home of the brave\u201d?", "authors": ["Megan Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Gqf80EkKKt-ohF4ZX0AJta70rPY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L7U5QJXLY4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
