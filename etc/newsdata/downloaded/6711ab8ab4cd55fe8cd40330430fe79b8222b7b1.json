Now, I\u2019m not recommending you go in there and have a go on the light fixtures, but if the opportunity somehow presents itself, at least you know you won\u2019t bring the ceiling down.\n\nThe venue is a tried and true Mary\u2019s sibling that\u2019s a bit more comfortable, featuring plush padded seating, taking bookings for groups between 8 and 60 (!!!), a dedicated wine list from the plonk-experts over at P&V Wine Merchants, and cocktails that\u2019ll knock you on your ass and put hairs on your chest simultaneously.\n\n\u201cPitt St looks, feels and tastes like Mary\u2019s, but one that may have taken some advice from two old fuckers that used to be young fuckers,\u201d Jake said.\n\n\u201cPadded seats, strong rum cocktails, and enough blues and rock n roll to get the chandeliers swinging.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate kicking the doors open on their fourth Mary\u2019s venue in Sydney, the Pitt St spot is piffing $5 burgers between 5-6pm for the rest of the week.\n\nJust look out for the two skeletons getting on the piss in the front window, and you\u2019re home.", "description": "The ratbags of the Sydney grub scene, Mary's, have kicked open the doors to their cheeky new Pitt St restaurant, and they're celebrating with cheap burgs.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/mrys-burgers-fb.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
