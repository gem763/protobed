That is what he is doing.\"\n\nSky News has since apologised and suspended a producer for allowing the \"appalling comments\" to be broadcast.\n\nLeyonhjelm has defended himself, claiming his comment was \"legitimate\" and that prior to his outburst, Hanson-Young claimed \"all men are rapists\", a remark she denies making.\n\n\"I am opposed to misandry, just as I am to misogyny and I am also entitled to call out double standards,\" Leyonhjelm said.\n\nALSO READ: Australian supermarket staff attacked in free bag ban anger\n\n\"So arguing on the one hand that all men are evil, the enemy, they're rapists and sexual predators. And on the other hand, having normal relationships with men, obviously is contradictory and I can call it out.\"\n\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called on Leyonhjelm to apologise.\n\n\"David Leyonhjelm's offensive remarks should have been withdrawn the moment they were uttered,\" he said.\n\n\"It is not too late for him to withdraw and apologise, that type of language has no place in parliament and it shouldn't have a place in any workplace.\"", "description": "An Australian senator has been accused of 'slut-shaming' a fellow parliamentarian after telling her to 'stop shagging men' in a grubby dispute that has seen the prime minister  demand an apology.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7484/c236f6b9401142e7af33034144f84f46.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-03"}
