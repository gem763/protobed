A year later he popped the question and they tied the knot in August 2018.\n\nThe newlyweds settled into marital bliss but a few months later tragedy struck. Saima (30) started feeling ill and visited the doctor with flu symptoms. The GP then prescribed her paracetamol and bed rest, according to Mirror.\n\nA day later Saima, a nursery manager, seemed okay and went to work. But she collapsed and was rushed to the emergency room.\n\n\u201cShe collapsed and started to have seizures. At that point, I knew it was something really bad,\u201d says Michael, who works in his family\u2019s clothing business.\n\n\u201cI told her that I loved her and begged her to stay awake \u2013 but then her eyes rolled back and she stopped responding. I just fell to my knees, crying in the middle of the hospital.\u201d\n\nDoctors did a scan which diagnosed Saima with encephalitis \u2013 a deadly condition that causes inflammation on the brain, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nSaima didn\u2019t make it and Michael decided to lay his wife to rest in her wedding dress to make her send-off in December last year, extra special.\n\nREAD MORE: Heartbroken widow reveals that husband\u2019s organ donation saved five lives\n\n\u201cShe was everything to me,\u201d says the 29-year-old widower.\n\n\u201cShe always said she wanted to wear her wedding dress again \u2013 so she was buried in it. And I asked that all the ushers from our wedding walk her coffin to her grave.\u201d\n\nFollowing the loss of his wife, Michael has since worked tirelessly to create awareness on the brain condition and even launched Cycle for Saima \u2013 a charity bike ride from Manchester to London.\n\nAll proceeds from the charity go to the Encephalitis Society, which dedicates itself to developing more research on the condition and treatment of the disease, The Sun reported.\n\n\u201cOn the day of her funeral, I told Saima I\u2019d make her proud,\u201d Michael says.\n\n\u201cAnd if one good thing can come out of this horrendous situation, it\u2019s to raise awareness and help other families.\u201d\n\nSources: The Sun, Mirror, Metro\n\n", "description": "A newlywed laid his bride to rest just 16 weeks after they said \u2018I do\u2019.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9530/b4c7057c478b497fb5c5d3cacd92a739.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
