It was the mid-1990s. She had no career and no direction. She was living in Tiburon, Calif., just over the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, taking classes and trying to figure things out.\n\nThen one day she went for a walk, and everything changed.\n\n\u201cWhen I talk about it, I get chills,\u201d she says now.\n\nOn that hike she met a woman walking two dogs. The woman wore a T-shirt that advertised a dog-walking business. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a thing, like it is now,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought, \u2018Can people get paid for this?\u2019 \u201d\n\nMorrison introduced herself. The two got to talking. The woman hired her. Three months later Morrison had started her own business, Woof! Pet Sitting Service. \u201cI just realized this is what I should be doing,\u201d she says. \u201cI loved to walk, and I love animals. \u2026 To be able to combine the two was mind-blowing to me.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Here\u2019s the No. 1 highest paid, most in-demand job in every American state \u2014 in one chart\n\nBy 2013, when she sold the business for an amount she says she can\u2019t reveal, it had more than 30 employees and had generated \u201cmillions of dollars in revenues,\u201d Morrison says. By then she had been working just three days a week for more than a decade. Her income broke the $100,000 barrier in the early 2000s, and from there \u201cit went up and up and up,\u201d she says. According to the U.S. Census, the average person in Morrison\u2019s Marin County, Calif., made $44,000 in 2001 and $72,000 today.\n\n-Morrison now runs a business advising others on building pet-sitting and pet-walking businesses, and continues to make \u201ca six-figure income,\u201d she says. It is, aptly, called \u201cThe Six-Figure Pet Business Academy.\u201d\n\nMany people dream of working for themselves. Many, of course, dream of making money doing something they love. Many also dream of working three days a week. Morrison managed to do all of that.\n\n-How did she do it? The turning point, she says, came in the early 2000s. Even though the company had been up and running for years and was growing successfully, she was still working seven days a week and often 12 to 14 hours a day. It\u2019s a tale familiar to many or most small-business owners. \u201cI woke up one day and realized, \u2018I have no life,\u2019 \u201d she recalls.\n\nShe made a drastic change. She slashed her involvement in the day-to-day minutiae of the business so she could focus on the big picture, dealing with clients and key matters like hiring the right employees. \u201cI thought, \u2018My business is growing, I need to grow, too. I need to be the captain of the ship, on deck, instead of being in the belly of the ship,\u2019 \u201d she says. She stopped walking or sitting pets herself. And she promoted one of her employees to take over day-to-day management.\n\n\u201cIn a year I went from working seven days a week to three days a week, and... I doubled what I\u2019d made the previous year, doing a lot less work.\u201d\n\nThe reason, she says, was that she \u201chad more freedom, and I was making more money, because I had more energy. ... I would connect with the clients. I was able to more thoughtfully deal with things. I was also able to look at who was on my team who was dragging us down.\u201d She expanded the business to the entirety of Marin County and into Sonoma County. \u201cIt\u2019s a numbers game,\u201d she says.\n\nMorrison struggled early on. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was doing,\u201d Morrison says. \u201cI had never run a business before. I didn\u2019t know how to get clients. I wasn\u2019t a very good boss in the beginning. I told people what to do. I was like, \u2018They work for me,\u2019 \u201d rather than, \u2018They work with me.\u2019 You really need to be a team.\u201d\n\nShe took business classes at a local community college and read a lot of books on how to run a business. Eventually she figured things out.\n\nThese days nonveterinary pet-care services are big business. Pet owners are on track to spend more than $6 billion on grooming, walking, sitting and related services this year, according to the American Pet Products Association, a trade body.\n\nWhat\u2019s her advice for those dreaming of following her path into dog walking, or just into starting a business? \u201cDon\u2019t give up your day job [too soon],\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s like asking a business to support you before it\u2019s ready.\u201d You need to advertise. \u201cHire a Facebook advertising expert,\u201d she says. \u201cFacebook FB, +0.05% ads are very important, and there\u2019s a learning curve.\u201d For locally based services such as dog walking, also look at advertising on Nextdoor.com, a social-media site serving local communities. Look at your competitors before setting your price. And try to set yours in the middle of the pack. Don\u2019t be the low bidder, Morrison warns: Customers are wary of any company whose prices seem unrealistically low.\n\nAnyone who wants to get work as a dog walker needs to establish contacts with local veterinary clinics, dog groomers and other related businesses. \u201cThey\u2019re your direct line [to pet owners],\u201d Morrison says. Give them your business cards and, if possible, leaflets. Check with your local humane society to see if it offers classes and training.\n\nOh, and get business insurance. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go into business without it. I wouldn\u2019t even think of it,\u201d says Morrison. \u201cThere\u2019s special pet sitters\u2019 insurance.\u201d\n\nOh, and here\u2019s an inside trick: If you\u2019re starting out in business as a pet sitter, look for cats instead of dogs. They\u2019re usually much more flexible and lower-maintenance.\n\nThe Moneyist: A letter from a reader on the poverty line: \u2018I know what it means to go hungry for five days until you get your next paycheck\u2019", "description": "Kristin Morrison started a business doing what she loves.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ241_arends_ZG_20190827123932.jpg"}
