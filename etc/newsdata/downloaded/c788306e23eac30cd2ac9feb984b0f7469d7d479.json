Vespa scooter maker has unveiled a redesign of its personal robot called Gita, which aims to free its human's hands so they can engage with others and enjoy activities\n\nInstead of deciding to use an automobile or truck to transport to lug packages and other goods , Piaggio Fast Forward, the creating firm, wants to help people walk, run, pedal and skate through life with the assistance of a family of vehicles like Gita.\n\nThe firm describes Gita as 'an intelligent and nimble cargo vehicle designed and engineered with the same attention to safety, braking, balancing and vehicle dynamics that you would expect of a high-performance motorcycle.'\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK? Users simply unlock the top lid and place anything from groceries to laundry inside of the machine. It follows a human operator by linking up to a white belt with sensors that the user wears. Once it has traveled through the environment, it is able refer back to that specific map - allowing it to take the journey autonomously. Users can also establish waypoints in the map, which Gita will stop at while it travels on its own and uses cameras and an ultrasonic range-finding system to 'see' and avoid obstacles in its way. The blue ball-like machine stands about 26 inches (66 cm) tall, can carry 40lbs (18 kg) and travels up to 22 mph (35 km/h).\n\nGita, pronounced 'jee-ta', which means 'short trip in Italian', is an intelligent vehicle with a communicative personality \u2013 making it the perfect travel buddy.\n\n'PFF may be a robotics company, but we're focused on revitalizing everyday human movement and social interconnections,' said Jeffrey Schnapp, Chief Visionary Officer and Co-founder at PFF.\n\n'By prioritizing healthy activity and social interaction, PFF is carving out a new category within the field of robotics: technology that moves the way people move and that augments human experiences rather than replacing or stifling them.'\n\n'With gita in tow, people are free to put down their screens, get moving and reconnect with the truly precious 'cargo' that shapes their lives: their partners, kids and friends.'\n\nGita will be available on November 18, 2019 for a retail price of $3,250.\n\nThe robot was first unveiled in 2017, but has since been redesigned with a more modern look \u2013 but still has the same concept.\n\nThe firm did reduce the speed at with the cargo robot travels. Gita only rolls around at six miles per hour now, compared to the previous 22 miles per hour. But it can carry everything from groceries to clothes to your furry pal's toys\n\nUsers simply unlock the top lid and place anything from groceries to laundry inside of the machine\n\nThe firm did reduce the speed at with the cargo robot travels.\n\nGita only rolls around at six miles per hour now, compared to the previous 22 miles per hour.\n\nThis is because its creators know it follows its owner and did not feel it needed to reach such fast speeds.\n\nIt is designed with a rechargeable battery that powers an estimated four hours of continuous operation.\n\nreach such fast speeds. It is designed with a rechargeable battery that powers an estimated four hours of continuous operation. When totally depleted, the battery recharges to optimum power in under two hours by plugging the charger into a standard wall outlet\n\nIt links to a unique white belt that is equip with a camera on the front and uses technology known as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which creates a 3D point cloud map while the human operator walks\n\nWhen totally depleted, the battery recharges to optimum power in under two hours by plugging the charger into a standard wall outlet.\n\nInside Gita, a discrete phone charging port keeps phones and other personal electronics charged while you're out and about.\n\nAt 50 pounds, Gita can be transported by car so long as it's secured, so you can enjoy hands-free movement when exploring away from home.\n\nUsers simply unlock the top lid and place anything from groceries to laundry inside of the machine.\n\nThe ball-like machine stands about 26 inches and uses vision sensors to follow you -- and it will be available to the publicon Nove. 18 for $3,250\n\nThe robot is designed to learn and navigate using both oversight and decision-making of humans.\n\nIt links to a unique white belt that is equip with a camera on the front and uses technology known as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which creates a 3D point cloud map while the human operator walks, reports New Atlas.\n\nAnd the robot is designed to recognize its owner as it moves through the map using the front-face camera attached to the belt.\n\nOnce it has traveled through the environment, it is able refer back to that specific map - allowing it to take the journey autonomously.\n\n'Think about how much more freely you would be able to move from one point to another if lugging cumbersome items was removed from the equation,' added Schnapp.\n\n'Gita frees up the human hand to focus on complex and creative everyday tasks by taking over mundane transportation chores.'\n\n'You can also send your Gita off on missions while you are busy doing something more pressing.'\n\nUsers can also establish waypoints in the map, which Gita will stop at while it travels on its own and uses cameras and an ultrasonic range-finding system to 'see' and avoid obstacles in its way.\n\nAnd with just a three hour charge, the robot can roll around for eight hours at walking speed.\n\nThe robot is also designed to park itself when not in use\n\nGita is set to launch on February 2nd in Boston, Massachusetts, but the firm has yet to reveal the pricing.", "description": "Vespa maker is launching a new product -- a cargo robot.
