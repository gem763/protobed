That\u2019s what decides who will be nominated and who will not be. And so, the love game inside Bigg Boss 13 house has begun already.\n\nVoot\n\nThe most popular love triangle as of now is of Paras Chhabra, Shehnaz Gill and Mahira Sharma. We know that Paras has a girlfriend outside of the house. But then, in one of the episodes, he also said that things between them both haven\u2019t been smooth-sailing.\n\nYoutube\n\nAnd we all always thought that Shehnaz Gill was a bit serious for him, right? After all, she asked him before the last eviction that if she goes out in the evictions, how she should contact him.\n\nDon't Miss 3.7 K SHARES 217 SHARES 405 SHARES 9.5 K SHARES 1.1 K SHARES\n\nVoot\n\nBut looks like, there\u2019s more to this story. Shehnaz Gill apparently has a boyfriend outside of the Bigg Boss 13 house, revealed first evicted contestant Dalljiet Kaur.\n\n\u201cWell, the whole love triangle and love happening in such a short time didn\u2019t work for me because I could see that it was all fake. It\u2019s a reality show but nothing is real. Within a week, I saw people falling in love, then forming a love triangle, and soon there was a break-up,\u201d Dalljiet was quoted by Firstpost.\n\nVoot\n\n\u201cAll the planning and plotting was already done. There\u2019s the winner of Splitsvilla, then another contestant faking love despite having a boyfriend outside the house. I don\u2019t know how to say, \u2018I love you, or look into my eyes\u2026\u2019 I can do all that as a character for my show but as Dalljiet, I didn\u2019t want to, and Salman too told me that I played with dignity,\u201d she added.\n\nThis a bit shocking, isn\u2019t it? How far in the game will Shehnaaz and Paras go with this love triangle? Only time will tell.", "description": "Shehnaz Gill apparently has a boyfriend outside of the Bigg Boss 13 house, revealed first evicted contestant Dalljiet Kaur.
