It\u2019s a wonderful time for you. Lest I be accused of attacking a pregnant woman, let\u2019s hope that impending parenthood brings wonderful joy to Chelsea and her husband and their families, that they all enjoy some time out of the spotlight and the insufferable 2016 battlespace-preparation narratives.\n\nBecause that spotlight and those narratives can get pretty damn insufferable. Sunday I strolled through Barnes and Noble and spied on the magazine rack:\n\nThe cover text reads, \u201cShe\u2019s Got Power, Influence, and a Plan To Change the World. Any Questions?\u201d\n\nSure, let\u2019s start with what she\u2019s done, or what she would have done, without her father\u2019s name or her mother\u2019s influence.\n\nThe piece tries to dance around its obvious mission of glamorizing a young woman whose adult life consists mostly of stepping through doors opened by her parents\u2019 power and meandering through the highest levels of high society without actually doing much:\n\nFor a decade after graduating from Stanford in 2001, Chelsea experimented with the world beyond the Clinton machine. In peripatetic bursts, she tried out international relations, then management consulting, then Wall Street, then a PhD. She even signed on for (an embarrassingly lightweight) gig as an NBC News \u201cspecial correspondent.\u201d Chelsea rationalizes this career promiscuity as a hallmark of being just another millennial, experimenting liberally until she figures out her professional purpose. But, of course, she\u2019s not just another millennial. She\u2019s political royalty.\n\nWell, that\u2019s one way of describing all that. Her brief stint at NBC represented an epic achievement of nepotism, in which she, with no experience in the field at all, somehow managed to set up a bidding war for her potential work:\n\nTo get the TV gig, Chelsea\u2019s team played off rival networks, holding a series of meetings in New York last fall with all the major television news outlets, including ABC, CBS, and CNN. \u201cHer agent calls, asks if you want to meet with Chelsea Clinton, you take the meeting,\u201d one network executive tells BuzzFeed.\n\nThere was a sense in the meetings that that the news channels were auditioning for her \u2014 not the other way around \u2014 which rubbed a few of those she met with the wrong way. \u201cThey acted like we should be grateful\u201d that she was offering herself to the networks, says the exec.\n\nFor non-political-royalty journalists, a position as a correspondent for a major network news operation\u2019s prime time show is a major achievement, reached only after paying their dues and working hard for years, even decades. For Chelsea, it was an entry-level gig.\n\nEarly on, the Fast Company profile mentions \u201cher White House\u2013Stanford-Oxford-Columbia-McKinsey\u2013hedge-fund grooming\u201d but most of that long list stems from her familial affiliation with those first two words. How many colleges dared turn down the daughter of the president and perhaps a second future president?\n\nAre we really to believe her path to her past jobs at McKinsey or \u201cassociate at Avenue Capital Group LLC, a New York- based hedge fund firm\u201d was any harder than the one to NBC?\n\nShe was the youngest in her class [age 23 or 24], hired at the same rank as those with M.B.A. degrees. Her interview was more like a conversation, said D. Ronald Daniel, a senior partner. \u201cThat\u2019s why she was a good consultant, because we are professional question-askers and professional listeners,\u201d Mr. Daniel said.\n\nChelsea assures us that her past workplaces were \u201cincredibly, fiercely meritocratic.\u201d Sometimes in past interviews, the interviewer inadvertently expresses surprise at the seemingly high-level jobs Chelsea Clinton gets handed:\n\nSo you currently work for NBC and you\u2019re studying for a PhD.\n\nWell, thankfully, I\u2019m no longer studying. I\u2019m slogging away on my dissertation.\n\nYou\u2019re finishing your dissertation, and you\u2019re a provost at NYU?\n\nWell, I was never the provost. The provost is the head academic \u2014\n\nAssistant provost?\n\nSo NYU, like most universities \u2014nthis is just for your own edification, I didn\u2019t know this either until I took a job at NYU \u2014 I took a job at NYU to fund my doctoral studies, which started there. But ultimately, the person that I really wanted to work most with was at Oxford, so I transferred back to Oxford. But in NYU, like most universities, the provost oversees all academic affairs, so everything relating to what classes get taught, and ensuring quality control there, to student life. [Editors\u2019 note: According to the Chronicle of Higher Education and the New York Times, Chelsea Clinton was \u201cassistant vice provost for the Global Network University at NYU.\u201d]\n\nChelsea took that \u201cAssistant Vice Provost\u201d position in 2010, at age 30.\n\nNow Chelsea\u2019s \u201cmaking her move\u201d, which warranted that Fast Company cover piece:\n\nNow, finally, she has decided to join the Clinton family business. As vice chair of the recently rebranded Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, she is helping one of the world\u2019s most notable philanthropies grow up.\n\nShe must have been extraordinarily talented to be named vice chair of an organization that has her name in its title, huh? What are the odds?\n\nThroughout the piece, there\u2019s this assumption that Chelsea Clinton was and is an exceptional achiever, without citing anything to support this: \u201cShe behaves as the overachiever that she has always been.\u201d \u201cShe is turning the Clinton Foundation into a more entrepreneurial enterprise.\u201d \u201cIn front of several hundred people, she displays all the earmarks of a natural leader: command of the subject matter, passion that feels authentic, and off-the-cuff comments spliced in with academic favorites such as gestalt and milieu.\u201d\n\nFast Company\u2019s correspondent Danielle Sacks deserves some credit for squeezing in some details about how Chelsea Clinton\u2019s public image is hyper-stage-managed and airbrushed, even if the cover of the magazine completely plays along with this process:\n\nChelsea\u2019s handlers are likely auditioning for White House gigs, should Hillary become president, and they bring to their current jobs all the paranoia that may serve them well in Washington. One repeatedly urges Chelsea not to change her facial expression during the cover shoot for this issue, standing so close that it\u2019s a miracle the staffer\u2019s mug isn\u2019t on the cover alongside Chelsea\u2019s. Another sits in on her interviews holding an iPhone like a stopwatch (\u201cyou have two minutes\u201d), whisks her away when she\u2019s in the middle of answering one final question, and scolds this journalist for even mentioning Doug Band\u2019s name in Chelsea\u2019s presence. It\u2019s all an odd, occasionally funny blend of control and confusion. Their four-page press release pointing to Chelsea\u2019s impact at the foundation only obfuscates her true accomplishments by mentioning such ephemera as visiting rural Myanmar \u201cwhere she delivered the six-billionth liter of clean water to a family\u201d or \u201ca Starkey Hearing Foundation event in Uganda, where Chelsea helped fit patients for hearing aids.\u201d\n\nDear friends on the Left: You can\u2019t bemoan the death of opportunity in America, and rail against the richest 1 percent, and then devour puff pieces on how exceptionally talented and wonderful the offspring of our super-wealthy political leaders are, earning plaudits just by showing up with their famous last names. Paul Krugman declared that Horatio Alger was dead back in 2003. The self-made success story may not be dead, but she\u2019s impeded by every powerful institution that sets up sweet, high-paying, low-responsibility gigs for the special children of the gilded class.\n\nWhat\u2019s really astounding is how our friends on the Left can turn their elite-status-and-wealth-resentment on and off as if it were attached to a light switch. You may recall Jim Hightower at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, sneering that George H. W. Bush was \u201cborn on third base and thought he had hit a triple.\u201d (The quote is frequently attributed to Ann Richards.) Yeah, that 55-combat-mission naval aviator who got shot down over the Pacific and who lost his four-year-old daughter to leukemia sure lived a life of ease and comfort.", "description": "Also in today\u2019s Jolt:\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s Ease Up on the \u2018Princess Chelsea\u2019 Coverage\n\nCongratulations, Clinton and Mezvinsky families.
