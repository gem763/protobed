The vote was passed by 332 to 99.\n\nCreasy reported the campaign to the police. In a tweet she said: \u201cFeel physically sick.\u201d She added that the police said they would not use PSPO [public spaces protection orders] powers \u2013 used when a particular nuisance in a particular area that is having a detrimental effect on the quality of life \u2013 to move the protesters on.\n\nThe Metropolitan police said they attended the protest on Saturday but there were no offences and no arrests took place. They said they did not receive any complaints about the contents of leaflets or posters at the event.\n\nThe mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, described the action as \u201csickening\u201d. In a tweet, he said: \u201cWhilst the right to peaceful protest must be respected, behaviour that deliberately targets women for harassment and intimidation should not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nCreasy said she was being targeted because she is pregnant, with people accusing her of being a hypocrite.\n\nThe website, which has been set up by the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform against the MP, includes a section that reads: \u201cStella Creasy deliberately conceals in all her public statements and dialogue on abortion \u2013 the humanity of the unborn child and what an abortion procedure actually entails.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cYet when she is speaking about her own baby in her womb, and her previous miscarriages, she speaks openly on their humanity.\u201d\n\nRuth Rawlins, a spokesperson for CBR UK, said: \u201cBy removing sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act, [Creasy] will remove all legal protection for the unborn child up to 28 weeks. This is a human rights abuse which needs to be called out. We have come to Walthamstow to communicate this to her constituents.\n\nCreasy\u2019s amendment argued that abortion laws in Northern Ireland, where women seeking a termination could face life imprisonment, were contrary to international human rights norms.\n\n\u201cHow much longer are the women of Northern Ireland expected to wait?\u201d she told MPs. \u201cHow much more are they expected to suffer before we speak up \u2013 the best of what this place does \u2013 as human rights defenders, not human rights deniers?\u201d\n\nAfter the vote, Creasy tweeted: \u201cThank you to everyone who today stood up for equality in Northern Ireland \u2013 whether for same-sex marriage or abortion, today we have said everyone in the UK deserves to be treated as an equal. There\u2019s a road to go yet but today a big step forward.\u201d", "description": "MP \u2018physically sick\u2019 at poster claiming to show aborted remains beside her image", "authors": ["Sarah Marsh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8807adb9f8d688381483aef54bb3948455c5f7d/0_58_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f3fea26f74693cafe352c8064c32d2eb", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
