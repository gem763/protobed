In five years, Williams has sponsored over 500 mammograms, his foundation announced Wednesday.\n\nThe former running back, who played for the Carolina Panthers and Pittsburgh Steelers, was inspired by his mom and aunts to create his foundation. His mother Sandra died from breast cancer in 2006, and all four of her sisters died from the same disease \u2014 all before they turned 50, according to the foundation.\n\nWilliams originally chose to pay for 53 mammograms because his mom was 53 years old when she died. The DeAngelo Williams Foundation calls the campaign \"53 Strong for Sandra.\" They started out by holding mammogram screening events for under-insured women in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nDeAngelo Williams attends an event for his foundation.

This can be life-changing for these women,\" Williams said in a statement to the \"Today\" show. \"We are enabling them to get this care that no one should ever be denied or not have access to.\"", "description": "Williams set out to pay for 53 mammograms, and this Breast Cancer Awareness Month, his foundation announced they far exceeded that goal", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/10/8ac38fc5-65e0-4fa1-aaef-dc142c17f3a4/thumbnail/1200x630/bb439526fb1cd281791aa0027d452032/69541822-2747375415297322-4210279667728384000-o.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
