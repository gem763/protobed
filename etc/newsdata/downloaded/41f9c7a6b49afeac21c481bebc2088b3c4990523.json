The phone is an extremely minor upgrade from the 7 Pro with a processor bump.\n\nHowever, OnePlus also released a McLaren edition of the phone, just like it did with last year\u2019s OnePlus 6T.\n\nThis year, the special edition sports 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The back of the phone has a glimmering pattern that reflects under light.\n\nThe phone comes with a special case made of carbon fiber and Italian-made Alcantara.\n\nThe #OnePlus7TPro #McLarenEdition comes with a precision-crafted protective case accented in carbon fiber and Italian-made Alcantara\u00ae, the same plush fabric that adorns the sophisticated interiors of McLaren\u2019s luxury sports cars. #OnePlus7TSeries pic.twitter.com/wgLQofOGOX \u2014 OnePlus India (@OnePlus_IN) October 10, 2019\n\nOnePlus packs a 30W charger with cable matching the papaya orange theme. Last year, OnePlus supplied a similar charger with the special edition. So there\u2019s not much difference there as well.\n\nAll in all, the phone looks quite stylish. But you should be a McLaren super fan to spend \u00a3799/ \u20b9 58,990 on it.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FOnePlus-Mclaren.jpg&signature=ac818dc14cda0330bb4db8cc74b20745", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
