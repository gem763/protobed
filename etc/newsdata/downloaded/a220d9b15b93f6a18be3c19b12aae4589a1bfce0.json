The sun beating down. No one around for miles. We all have our desert island fantasies. How might you fare marooned on a strange land? Could you fend for yourself? In the spirit of Robinson Crusoe, I\u2019ve decided to spend five days castaway on an uninhabited island in the south Pacific. The place is Kabakon, one of Papua New Guinea\u2019s 13 Duke of York islands, 800km east of the capital Port Moresby. It is owned by the tribe who live on the neighbouring island of Karawara, who use it as their garden.\n\nA hotel on the mainland sets up the basics for me but, to all extents and purposes, it is a term of solitary confinement. Just me and my flimsy penknife. Bouncing over the waves to the island, we pass the steaming volcano Tavurvur, a startling reminder that I\u2019m slap bang on the Pacific ring of fire. Then we run into a pod of frolicking dolphins, which skip along with the boat like they\u2019re old friends. It\u2019s a cheery omen for the adventure ahead.\n\nAfter about 45 minutes, Kabakon heaves into view.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe island is 80 hectares of white sand, fringed with palms and blue water, and is as close to a paradisiacal idyll as I have ever seen. There\u2019s no luxury here. I\u2019m staying in a two-roomed shack with a mattress on the floor, mosquito net, and some chairs and a table on the veranda. The hotel has provided basic food \u2013 bread, dried noodles, fruit and a few tins. There\u2019s no wifi or TV; no signs of digital life. Nothing to tie me to the world outside.\n\nShowing me the ropes is Corey Eron, councillor of Karawara, and the brainchild of the trip. He wants to encourage tourism to the island to help the village economy. He is an idealist but practical with it and charismatic to boot. His dreads shake with mirth as his infectious laughter punctuates the conversation. You can see why the islanders hold him in high regard, voting him their council representative every year for the past seven. He\u2019ll keep me company some of the time but I\u2019ve told him I need to do this alone.\n\nMy first task is to explore the island. My shack faces Karawara in the east with the mountains of New Ireland shimmering dimly in the distance. The side I\u2019m on is beach and sand while the other is tall rocky cliffs that block the battering encroachment of the sea. Inland is thick vegetation and the Karawaran garden. I determine to walk around the island, which should take two to three hours\u2026 probably.\n\nA guy stops on the path and pulls out some betel nuts and lime powder from his bag, which I chew, turning my lips red. I\u2019m invited to eat taro (root) and freshly cooked fish stew. And I\u2019m offered homebrew\n\nKabakon is filled with curious life. Blue and red starfish and sea cucumbers bask in the water, little darting fish weave between your toes. Inland, there are red-beaked parrots, multicoloured lizards and black and white willie wagtail birds with their absurd rear-end movement like they\u2019re doing the twist. The plant life is equally fascinating. Spiky pandanus palms and coconuts dominate but there is also a single huge banyan tree, the tallest on the island and for miles around, with roots hanging like thick dark ropes from the trunk. As I\u2019m walking along, I come across a sudden bloom of colourful flowers and weeping willow trees, which seem incongruous in their surroundings.\n\nIn fact, this is part of Kabakon\u2019s strange history. In 1902, the island was bought by one August Engelhardt, a 26-year-old German, who was looking for somewhere to develop his utopian philosophy based on principles of sun worship and cocovorism \u2013 the notion that eating nothing but coconuts is key to solving man\u2019s physical ailments. He\u2019d come into a substantial inheritance and purchased Kabakon for his new Eden.\n\nThe first few years were idyllic. Engelhardt established a coconut plantation and called his followers to join him in this brave new world. They called themselves Sonnenorden and practised sun worship and nudity and lived off coconuts. But it didn\u2019t last. The alien living conditions took their toll and several died. Others turned their back on him. Engelhardt was eventually left alone, was gripped by malaria and went insane. He died aged 46 and was rumoured to have been buried on the neighbouring island of Mioko, though his grave was never found.\n\nThe ghost of this eccentric man occupies me as I weave my way around the island, but progress is hard. The vegetation is thick and my path is blocked by tall plants draped in spiderwebs, while the cliffs prevent me walking along the water. Eventually, I decide to turn inland, where I stumble upon the village plantations.\n\nThe island garden is a beautiful sight. Immaculately tended plots of banana and coconut trees mixed with yams, peanuts and all kinds of tropical fruit. It looks, indeed, very Edenic. But I\u2019ve now no idea where I am or how to get back. Even as I\u2019m thinking that I might be stuck a young face appears from the undergrowth.\n\n\u201cThe beach path?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say sheepishly, trying to excuse my intrusion and wondering if I have trampled on his hard work.\n\nHe gestures me to follow, then asks if I\u2019d like to eat some singapo. Unsure what it is, I say yes \u2013 in for a penny, in for a pound. He takes me up a different path where we come upon a group of boys cooking yams on a fire. One offers me the singapo: \u201cCrunchy,\u201d he says, while another asks if I want a kulao (green coconut). I nod and he immediately leaps on to the base of a 30ft-coconut tree and starts shimmying up using no more than a leaf harness hooked round his feet. In a flash, he\u2019s up there hacking down coconuts, suspended upside down with one hand. Madness, I think, and eat the purple, smoked yam and drink water fresh from the coconut with a new appreciation.\n\nThe islanders are quick with humour and generous to a fault. It\u2019s one of my first lessons about the Karawaran people. Language might be an issue but communication is easy; they are charming.\n\nLater I chat with Corey about life here. It looks like paradise but living isn\u2019t easy. The relentless march of modernity is inescapable. Customs are being eroded. The islanders used to trade exclusively with shell money (kina) but that is dying off as notes and coin currency become de facto. With coconuts and fish, the island\u2019s only two money earners, it is harder to buy things.\n\nCorey says they are lucky to have the garden island, which provides them with food. But for everything else, they need money. Better medicine, for example \u2013 seven people died of malaria last year. Or school equipment, and clothes. The PNG government is well-intentioned but notoriously poor in execution. The country draws explorers and anthropologists to the fascination of a land that has over 800 languages, wild and ancient tribes and customs, some that seem truly outlandish and brutal to us. Yet the real trouble here is not the ancient customs but modern governmental mismanagement, which is unlikely to change soon.\n\nCorey\u2019s grandmother once tasted human flesh. She told of how the tribe caught a man, tied him up, removed his eyes and turned his head around, then kept him by the fire still alive for three days while they collected sweet potatoes until finally he was thrown in\n\nCollapsed on my mattress, I\u2019m ready to sleep but the night brings strange noises and even stranger visitors. Things come hissing and creeping into my feverish mind. It seems to take hours until finally, hot and sweaty, I\u2019m soothed by the sounds of the tropical rain that thrums on the thatched roof and fall into a deep slumber.\n\nIn the morning I find the table covered in delicate ant wings, their bodies seared off by the lamp I left lit overnight. It is something of a symbolic sacrifice.\n\nWaking on the second day there is a pull for the familiar. The desire for something you know, because you\u2019re stuck here in these unfamiliar surroundings. I wonder what the weather is like back home. If Boris is PM yet. Whether anyone\u2019s missing me. I walk along the sands until I come upon a man tying crabs he caught overnight. They call him \u201cSir Crab\u201d because he is a specialist in catching them. \u201cThe crabs are clever,\u201d he says, \u201cso you have to be cleverer than them.\u201d\n\nHe gives me two freshly caught mud crabs, which, when boiled, produce the freshest meat broken off the shell. Simplicity and patience are key here. Life is slow and meandering. Villagers paddle along in their canoes to the sound of birds and the rik rik of crickets. You quickly learn there\u2019s no need to chase time.\n\nCorey takes me to Karawara. At every turn, the islanders greet me warmly. A man stops on the path and pulls out some betel nuts and lime powder from his bag, which I chew, turning my lips red. I\u2019m invited to eat taro and freshly cooked fish stew and drink homebrew. The village is just 30 minutes walk from one end to the other but is so overflowing with life, generosity and community that I wonder how or why this place is slowly slipping away to western mores.\n\nIt\u2019s clear the spirit of Engelhardt endures. One of the men shows me old photos of him \u2013 whom they call Tokelau or Mr Coconut \u2013 sitting on a chair looking into the camera with a haunted expression on his face. Apparently he was a good man but the customs \u2013 nudism and all \u2013 disconcerted them. Some called him a ghost.\n\nThe local legends and myths border on the fantastically insane but somehow seem believable here. Corey speaks of the magic men who went through extreme initiations, fasting for months, eating 20 or more ginger roots in a go, and other crazy acts of torture before they acquired magic powers. These men could become tiny and transport themselves to different places by stepping on rocks or were carried around by flying foxes. They had power over nature \u2013 asking the coconut tree to bend down and provide them with coconuts.\n\nThere are darker things too. Cannibalism. Corey\u2019s grandmother, who died aged 115 last year, tasted human flesh. She told of how the tribe caught a man, tied him up, removed his eyes and turned his head around, then kept him by the fire still alive for three days while they collected sweet potatoes until finally throwing him in \u2013 a custom which has fortunately also slipped away.\n\nAt some point, I express an interest in fishing and lo and behold the next morning four boys rock up in their boat with spearguns and goggles and take me with them to the other side of the island to catch fish. The boat stops and sways as waves dash against the rocky face. I\u2019m feeling a little grim but try not to show it. Wilson hands me my fishing tool \u2013 a homemade speargun that\u2019s been whittled out of wood with a thick rubber band attached to it. I\u2019m supposed to get in the water and load this with a spear before catching something.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t point it at anyone, it goes off easy,\u201d he warns.\n\nI\u2019m not convinced by their chances, but the boys are specialists, diving with ease like they have since they were kids. I\u2019m less effective but it\u2019s exhilarating all the same. The coral is teeming with marine life yet to be diminished by overfishing. We return with a bucket of multicoloured tropical fish that we smoke over the fire and share. I doubt I\u2019ve had fresher \u2013 straight from sea to coals to stomach.\n\nOn my last evening, I sit on the sand and watch villagers paddling back to their island, canoes loaded with crops. Songs echo out into the air as the light fades and the mountains in the distance get dimmer and dimmer and then\u2026 silence. Just the waves and the darkness and the stars, hundreds and thousands of them, glimmering in the sky.\n\nIt is a place of perfect peace.\n\nThe mornings have been a little overcast so far but the final day brings a cloudless blue sky. The sun is peeping over the distant mountains of New Ireland. I rush to the water and see it rising, shyly at first, then exploding into golden beams that illuminate the world. Augustus would have been happy. But there is a final twist to the tale.\n\nWhile we are waiting for the boat to take us back to the mainland, one of the villagers \u2013 Vapot, a quiet one who speaks little English \u2013 tells Corey that two Germans came in 2002 and she and some of the other villagers went with them and dug up bones in the north of the island.\n\nIt was the same spot where Augustus planted his flowers. I\u2019m frankly agog. But then again there\u2019s nothing too fanciful about this strange, crazy, beautiful place that should surprise me. He was right here all along.\n\nGetting there\n\nThe trip was organised through the PNG Tourism Authority. Air Niugini flies daily from Singapore to Port Moresby and has connecting flights to Rabaul.
