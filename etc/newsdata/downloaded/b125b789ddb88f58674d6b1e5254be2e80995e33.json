Turns out social media companies send our posts to only some of our friends. (That's why I ask for your email address. Then they can't cut us off.)\n\nWhy might they cut us off?\n\nOne reason is that we'd drown in a fire hose of information if they showed us everything. The companies' algorithms cleverly just send us what the computer determines we'll like.\n\nAnother reason may be that the companies are biased against conservative ideas.\n\nThey deny that. But look at their actions. Social media companies say they forbid posts that \"promote violence,\" including ones that encourage violence offline.\n\nBut antifa groups that promote violence still have accounts. The Twitter account of the group in Portland, Oregon, that recently beat up journalist Andy Ngo, leaving him with brain damage, is still up.\n\n\"In Austin, they were calling for a paramilitary operation!\" says Glenn Beck. That antifa group's Facebook account is also still up, even though it links to a manifesto calling for opponents to be \"beaten bloody.\"\n\nIn my newest video, Beck, who runs a big media operation called The Blaze, says social media companies push a leftist agenda.\n\n\"They manipulate algorithms to reshape our world.\"\n\nBeck himself hasn't been banned, but he says Facebook limits his reach, putting him in a \"digital ghetto.\"\n\n\"They're shaping you,\" he warns.\n\nIs it true?\n\nAlthough I'm not a conservative, sometimes I do notice odd things happening with my posts.\n\nOn average, my videos get more than a million views. But when I did one that criticized Facebook, that video got half as many views.\n\nBecause Facebook didn't show it to many people?\n\nI can't know. Facebook won't say.\n\nToday, social media companies are pressured to cut off anyone spreading hate. In response, YouTube and Facebook say they now even demote content that almost violates policies.\n\nBut those antifa accounts are still up.\n\nBy contrast, Beck says, conservative accounts are censored merely for making fun of Democrats.\n\n\"Remember the person who slowed down (a video of House Speaker Nancy) Pelosi?\" he asked.\n\nThe video made Pelosi sound drunk. It went viral, but once Facebook got complaints, the company announced it \"dramatically reduced its distribution.\"\n\nWhen Facebook did that, notes Beck, \"The person in charge happened to be one of the leaders in Nancy Pelosi's office who had just left to go to work for Facebook.\"\n\nI told Beck that Facebook hires some Republicans. \"They do,\" he replied, \"but only about 20%, and not in top level positions.\"\n\nThe site Spinquark did the research Beck cites, finding dozens of Democratic campaign workers who now work for social media companies.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg once invited Beck and some others to come to his offices to talk about bias.\n\n\"I sat with him and he said, 'Why would we do that?' And I said, 'I want to believe you, but your actions don't match.'\"\n\nBeck was also unhappy with conservatives at that meeting. \"Some said, 'Mark, solve this by having affirmative action. ... For every liberal you hire, hire a conservative.'\"\n\n\"I don't want that!\" Beck said. \"We don't need more regulation!\"\n\nWe don't.\n\nBut it's human nature, when people see a problem, to demand government do something.\n\nBeck himself fell prey to that when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claimed she saw border guards telling migrants to drink water from toilets. On his radio show, Beck said government should \"prosecute anyone making outrageous charges like this!\"\n\nI gave him a hard time about that. \"You want prosecution of members of Congress who say nonsense?!\"\n\nBeck laughed and quickly walked his statement back. \"John, I speak five hours off script every day. ... There's a lot that I vomit out.\"\n\nThe solution?\n\n\"No censorship,\" says Beck.\n\n\"Publish everything?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes!\" answered Beck. \"We can handle it. Stop treating us like children.\"\n\nI agree. On at least some platforms, all speech should be free. The more that is blocked, the less we learn.", "description": "I now make my living by releasing short videos on .10/02/2019 8:46:26AM EST.", "authors": ["John Stossel", "Beth Baumann", "Leah Barkoukis", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/299/cf449fb1-b048-4cc2-bf38-02db029108a4.jpg"}
