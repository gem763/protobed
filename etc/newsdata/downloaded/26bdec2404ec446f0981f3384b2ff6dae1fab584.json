Areas most at risk from flooding and lightning strike include Alexandria, Port Said and the north of the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nThere are two large-scale influences on the weather that are currently in phase over eastern Africa: firstly, the waters of the Indian Ocean are warmer than usual off the African coast; and secondly, a wave in the upper atmosphere, known as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is encouraging any thunderstorms or areas of low pressure to deepen.\n\nThese two have contributed to the recent flooding in Kenya, with the MJO likely to have strengthened the downpours in Egypt.", "description": "Thundery rain flooded the streets of Cairo but for northern Egypt, there is worse to come.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/24/4595380bd47a46afb03bb1a3822006ce_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
