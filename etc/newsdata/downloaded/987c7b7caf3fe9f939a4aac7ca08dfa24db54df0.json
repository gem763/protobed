The name \"REKT\" is an in-joke among gamers and cryptocurrency enthusiasts alike, used when someone gets \"wrecked\" by an unfortunate turn of events.\n\nA major virtue of cryptocurrency is that everyone can see the underlying blockchain, meaning it's impossible to fake or forge a transaction \u2014 a record of the money move is right there, permanent and \"immutable,\" in blockchain parlance. So while each individual user is anonymous, it's possible to see when a bad decision was made and some unfortunate soul took a bath.\n\nThe REKT account is part schadenfreude, part warning: trading cryptocurrency is risky, and people can lose large sums of money. On Bitmex, the risk is even higher since people are able to trade on margin, meaning they can borrow money from the exchange by putting down a bit of collateral.\n\nIf things go well, they stand to make a profit \u2014 should the price of the token go up, they'll pocket the difference, less the loan they took from Bitmex. If the market turns against them, however, Bitmex can liquidate their position, keeping whatever collateral they put down and potentially even putting them in debt.\n\nTo add insult to injury, REKT automatically tweets out how much those users lost, along with funny phrases and emojis that indicate just how bad the loss was.\n\nThis tweet in particular meant that the user \"went long\" on a trade, buying the coin with the expectation to hang on and sell it later at a higher price. When the price dropped, Bitmex automatically cashed the user out \u2014 at a lower price than they originally bought it for.\n\nAnother bot account called Whale Alert, tracks the movement of large amounts of bitcoin. As a complement to REKT, its tweets show the massive sums of cryptocurrency moving around the whole ecosystem.\n\nEven with the fortunes made and lost here, people seem to enjoy the spectacle: The REKT account has almost 46,000 followers, while Whale Alert is nearing 98,000.\n\nOne follower \u2014 prominent cryptocurrency expert Jacob Canfield\u2014 says the cryptocurrency community on Twitter \u2014 bots and all \u2014 is an important resource for traders and investors alike as a way to see how the market is moving.\n\n\"If you're going to be an active member in the space, Twitter is an absolute must so you watch things happening in real time,\" he said.\n\nCanfield is a full-time cryptocurrency investor and has an active Twitter following of his own. A former pharmaceutical trader, he became a \"crypto influencer\" by warning people about cryptocurrency scams.\n\nToday, Canfield runs Signal Profits ,where he gives trading advice and predictions to followers on Twitter, Discord, and YouTube.\n\n\"It's evolved dramatically,\" he explained. \"Due to the level of novice-ness coming in, I had to drastically change my approach. Most setups I give now are as safe as possible.\"\n\nAnd that makes sense, so no one gets REKT.", "description": "Bots have joined the crypto community on Twitter, leveraging the open nature of the blockchain for better or worse.", "authors": ["Zoe Schiffer"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d166c97a17d6c191653d9c4-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-29"}
