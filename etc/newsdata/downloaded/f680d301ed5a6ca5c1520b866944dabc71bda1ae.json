By 2003, however, Microsoft got into the market in earnest, releasing a similar product for its Windows operating system.\n\nAt the time, VMware was a little startup, while Microsoft had already been around for going on three decades. And, unsurprisingly, Microsoft's own virtualization software worked better with Windows than anything VMware could come up with.\n\nWith little chance for VMware to catch up on Windows, it took a different strategy. VMware decided to focus on Linux, an open source operating system popular with developers.\n\nAt the time, Poonen says, Microsoft basically \"denied that Linux existed.\" To Poonen's point, Microsoft spent years competing fiercely with Linux and other open source software, and in 2001, former Microsoft CEO Steve Balmer even called Linux \" a cancer.\"\n\nIt meant a huge opportunity for VMware to go after a massive market that Microosft was all but ignoring.\n\n\"Building a better product not only for Windows but also Linux put VMware on the map,\" Poonen told Business Insider.\n\nBy the time Microsoft finally started accepting Linux, under CEO Satya Nadella, VMware was already well-established as a multi-billion dollar company and a pillar of the enterprise software market.\n\nRead more: A Microsoft engineer says that the use of Linux has overtaken Windows on its own Microsoft Azure cloud\n\nOverall, Poonen says that startups should take away the lesson of the David and Goliath story. To take on a giant in the technology industry, you need to figure out where exactly you have the advantage, and strike quickly. For VMware, this advantage was Linux.\n\n\"I think you have to have first off an incredible David and Goliath mindset,\" Poonen said. \"You have something about what you built that is disruptively innovative and then the incumbent will have scaled, but won't have speed. If you have something that's disruptively innovative, you can move fast.\"\n\nWhile Microsoft and VMware remain competitors, things are cooling off a little: Earlier this year, the two announced a cloud partnership that forms the foundation of a formal friendship.", "description": "When VMware first launched its ESX product, Microsoft had built a competing product for Windows.
