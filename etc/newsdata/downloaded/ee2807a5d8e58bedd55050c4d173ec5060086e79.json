From the first mention of Trump\u2019s desired \u201cdeliverable\u201d from Ukraine, successive layers of witnesses and documents have added to an indictment of the president\u2019s conduct that only gets heavier, as Trump howls his defenses to the wind.\n\nTrump impeachment catch-up: where we are right now Read more\n\nOn Tuesday, things got even worse for Trump \u2013 much worse, as many saw it.\n\nFor almost 10 hours, William Taylor, a former military officer and career diplomat with the rank of ambassador under the last four presidents, spoke with congressional investigators about how the Trump administration has been conducting a two-track foreign policy in Ukraine, where Taylor is in charge of the US embassy.\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know most of what was said. The current public record of the closed-door testimony comprises only a copy of Taylor\u2019s 15-page opening statement \u2013 and the spectacle of the ashen faces of members of Congress as they filed out from the hearing.\n\n\u201cThis testimony is a sea change,\u201d congressman Stephen Lynch told reporters.\n\nIn his testimony, Taylor explained his discovery of an \u201cirregular, informal policy channel\u201d by which the Trump administration was pursuing objectives in Ukraine \u201crunning contrary to the goals of longstanding US policy\u201d. What the \u201cinformal channel\u201d wanted \u2013 and briefly obtained, Taylor said \u2013 was for the Ukrainian president to agree to go on CNN to announce an investigation of Joe Biden, whom Trump sees, perhaps mistakenly, as a top 2020 threat.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bill Taylor, acting ambassador to Ukraine, testified of \u2018an informal policy channel\u2019 by which the Trump administration was pursuing objectives in Ukraine.

It was just the kind of testimony that seemed to answer even the most stubborn demands of Trump loyalists such as Senator Lindsey Graham for additional, definitive proof that Trump was turning the broad power of his office to his own narrow devices.\n\n\u201cIf you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing,\u201d Graham said at the weekend.\n\nThe senator denied in a Fox News appearance Tuesday that Taylor had delivered such evidence. But Taylor added significant ballast to the allegation that Trump was attempting to extort Ukraine into ginning up bad news about Biden.\n\nWhat Taylor added was a careful stitchwork of detail, describing who was working to extort the Ukrainians, how they were going about it, how their aims clashed with stated US policy, how the Ukrainians responded, and what people said to him about it at the time.\n\nTaylor made clear he has the memos and other records to back up his story. And he exposed the slapstick clumsiness of the Trump flunkies working the \u201cinformal channel\u201d \u2013 notably Gordon Sondland, the hotelier and Trump mega-donor turned ambassador.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland tried to explain to me that President Trump is a businessman,\u201d Taylor testified. \u201cWhen a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, he said, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cthe explanation made no sense\u201d, Taylor argued. \u201cThe Ukrainians did not \u2018owe\u2019 President Trump anything, and holding up security assistance for domestic political gain was \u2018crazy\u2019.\u201d\n\nReaction to Taylor\u2019s testimony generally fell between shock and dumbfoundedness. \u201cI cannot overstate how damaging this Ambassador Taylor testimony is to Trump,\u201d tweeted Neal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general.\n\n\u201cTaylor\u2019s statement is a completely devastating document,\u201d wrote Susan Hennessey, the executive director of the Lawfare site. \u201cI know they will find a way but it\u2019s just impossible to imagine how Republicans in Congress will be able to defend this. It is well beyond what most assumed was the worst-case scenario.\u201d\n\nThe White House issued a statement Tuesday night impugning Taylor, a Trump appointee, as part of a cadre of \u201cradical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the constitution\u201d. But the taller the evidence against him, the smaller Trump\u2019s protests seemed.\n\nDemocratic senator Amy Klobuchar, a presidential candidate, challenged Republicans to take a stand. \u201cAfter Diplomat Taylor\u2019s testimony you can no longer question whether this happened,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cThe question is if you choose to follow the law or be part of the cover-up.\u201d\n\nTrump huddled Tuesday night with members of his legal team, the Wall Street Journal reported, and he urged congressional Republicans to do more to rebut the impeachment inquiry. But there were reportedly no talking points, and no one knew quite what they were supposed to say, or whom to take that direction from.\n\nNotably absent from the meeting of Trump\u2019s advisors was Rudy Giuliani, whom Taylor describes as running the shadow operation in Ukraine. \u201cThe official foreign policy of the United States was undercut by the irregular efforts led by Mr Giuliani,\u201d Taylor said. He described a seemingly free hand for Giuliani, whose foreign clients include or have included Ukraine-based antagonists of current and former US officials, to open and close diplomatic channels and to direct US policy as he pleased.\n\nOne of the weightiest impacts of Taylor\u2019s testimony might have to do with the senior US officials it names. Taylor took his concerns about Trump\u2019s alleged attempt to extort Ukraine, he said, to both national security adviser John Bolton and to secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Bolton, who has since resigned, reacted with outrage and frustration.\n\nPompeo, who is eyeing a US Senate bid in his home state of Kansas, apparently greeted Taylor\u2019s warning with silence.\n\n\u201cThis is not the story of corruption in Ukraine,\u201d tweeted the political strategist David Axelrod. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of corruption at the highest levels of the US government. It\u2019s the story of extortion, with US military aid to a besieged ally held hostage to the president\u2019s personal political project.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s critics say the story is plain: that the president twisted the immense powers of his office to personal ends, in betrayal of constitution and country. When it comes time to prove it, Taylor\u2019s testimony is likely to be front and center.", "description": "Diplomat added significant ballast to the allegation Trump was trying to extort Ukraine into ginning up bad news about Biden", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/778cf3739a29ef993cc2f73f05897215c1ec1852/0_78_4655_2793/master/4655.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=813a9d3b05831e1fe12f14185c87c209", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
