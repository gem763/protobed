What if Lincoln had skipped the theatre? What if David Cameron hadn\u2019t called his referendum?\n\nAl Charron wonders what Canadian rugby might have become, had one game at the 1991 World Cup turned out just slightly different.\n\n\u201cWe had a really big belief in ourself that we could surprise the world,\u201d says the Hall of Fame back-rower, all 76 caps and four World Cups of him.\n\nRugby World Cup 2019: Canada team guide Read more\n\nIn 1991, Charron was a raw-boned 25-year-old Ottawa Irish flanker, a rare Ontarian in a team dominated by British Columbia.\n\n\u201cI think we should have beaten France,\u201d he says. \u201cWe played France in our last pool game\u201d \u2013 after beating Romania and Fiji \u2013 \u201cand I think we were down 10-0 before we figured out we could play with these guys. And we ended up outplaying them and outscoring them I think for the rest of the game.\u201d\n\nCanada lost 19-13 so Charron, Stormin\u2019 Norm Hadley, Gareth Rees and all qualified for a quarter-final in Lille. That brought heroic defeat, 29-13 to New Zealand, Charron scoring a try, underdogs cheered to the rafters. Canada seemed ready to join the top table.\n\nWe had a really big belief in ourself that we could surprise the world\n\nCharron thinks wistfully back. If France had been beaten Canada would have played a quarter-final in Paris instead \u2013 against Will Carling\u2019s England.\n\n\u201cEngland were an unbelievable side,\u201d Charron says, \u201cand they were unlucky to lose the final. But I would have liked to match up against England, because we were kind of built in the same way: strong forward pack, heavily relying on the fly-half.\u201d\n\nBeing as modest as he is hugely engaging, he doesn\u2019t put it in stark black and white. So here it is: if Canada had beaten England at the Parc des Princes \u2013 a battle perhaps even more brutal than Le Crunch \u2013 they would have had a decent chance of beating Scotland at Murrayfield and reaching the final at Twickenham.\n\nWhat might have been. Four words to sum up Canadian rugby.\n\nAfter 1991, Canada kept on coming. They beat Wales in Cardiff, Charron scoring the winning try, they beat England, Scotland, France and Italy. At the 1995 World Cup they ran the world champion Australians close and fought the next No1, South Africa, at the Battle of Boet Erasmus. In 1999 they pushed France again.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Charron poses with the Webb Ellis Cup at the House of Commons in Ottawa.

Coincidentally or not, Canada have struggled ever since. England 2015 was the first time they lost all their World Cup games but this cycle brought a new low. Beaten by the USA and Uruguay, Kingsley Jones\u2019s men had to qualify for the current World Cup via the repechage, past Germany, Hong Kong and Kenya.\n\nAsked what went wrong, Charron, who works for Rugby Canada in fundraising and player liaison, offers a simple answer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Canada has ever really got a full grasp of the professional set-up in rugby,\u201d he says. In such a vast country, \u201cthe money\u2019s spread out quite a bit \u2013 the money that does come in.\u201d\n\nThere are steep challenges in funding men\u2019s and women\u2019s XVs as well as sevens squads set for the Tokyo Olympics. Charron speaks with sadness about the decline of a club scene that thrived in amateur days but is now beset by rising costs, insurance concerns, a struggle to keep young talent flowing and older players playing.\n\nBut he is also passionately committed to the hard work needed to help Canada\u2019s men \u201cplay \u2019em tough\u201d \u2013 an idiom he returns to when contemplating past battles \u2013 on the grandest stage once more.\n\nThe national team is passionate too, of course. It\u2019s led by another big back-rower, Tyler Ardron, a standout with the Chiefs in Super Rugby. Out in the backs there\u2019s DTH van Der Merwe and Jeff Hassler, the former still with Glasgow, the latter once an Osprey.\n\nCanada\u2019s always showed up at World Cups and raised their game\n\nHassler is one of a strong contingent from Major League Rugby, which Charron picks out as a positive as it heads for season three. The double-champion Seattle Seawolves might be as American as a Starbucks Venti latte but they are led by the veteran Canada scrum-half Phil Mack and employ a hard core of his compatriots. Toronto Arrows fly the flag at home.\n\nThe true impact of MLR will be felt with time. In Japan, Canada must face Italy, Namibia, South Africa and New Zealand. In August, Canada lost to Tonga. In September, Tonga conceded 92 points to the All Blacks.\n\nCharron played for Moseley, Bristol, Dax and Pau but kept coming back for Canada, even in his late 30s with a horrendously busted knee. A disparate squad, on relatively low pay, expected to front up to the best in the world? It seems awfully familiar.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult thing for the players to get their heads around,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of them are coming from professional set-ups and we\u2019re not as professional as we\u2019d like to be in every sense of the word. So there\u2019s still, you know, some bean counting going on that sometimes takes away from proper preparation and development for big games.\u201d\n\nJones, Canada\u2019s Welsh coach, has hinted he might rest key players for New Zealand and South Africa. That might make those games uglier still but he would have good reason. Oddly, this World Cup presents an opportunity.\n\nIf Italy and Namibia can be beaten, third place in Pool B will ensure qualification for the 2023 World Cup in France. The irony is not lost on Canada\u2019s great rivals, the US Eagles, whose dominance in North America has been rewarded with an even harder draw.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tyler Ardron in action against Hong Kong, last November.

Though Namibia are \u201cranked 23rd and we\u2019re 22nd\u201d, he doesn\u2019t understand how World Rugby comes up with the rankings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d he insists.\n\nBut then, Canadian rugby players, from Charron to Ghislaine Landry to the minis of Meraloma and Burlington Centaurs, always play \u2019em tough.\n\n\u201cCanada\u2019s always showed up at World Cups and raised their game,\u201d Charron says. \u201cSo I\u2019m hopeful we can play in a manner that is going to be exciting and hopefully get people out of their seats.\n\n\u201cIf we should beat Italy and Namibia, that would certainly be a big boost and set us up for money coming from World Rugby a lot earlier. It sets our schedule out and tells us what we need to do, building towards France in 2023. It makes life easier on everyone, from administrative staff up to the CEO, coaching staff, players. We would know where we stand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a tall ask, but maybe they already consider us a win. Maybe that\u2019s the one thing we might have going for us.\u201d\n\nHe laughs. \u201cHopefully they\u2019re looking past us.\u201d\n\nBack when Charron was in his prime, playing \u2019em tough with Gord Mackinnon, Glenn Ennis, Eddie Evans and Rod Snow, some very good teams made the same costly mistake.", "description": "The great back-rower is pained by his country\u2019s current struggles but sees an opportunity to beat Italy and surprise the game again", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae1e6f5898eb7b856601e2a2737b780f44d8124f/0_102_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=de9815cd3457050dd7d496eadfb88083", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
