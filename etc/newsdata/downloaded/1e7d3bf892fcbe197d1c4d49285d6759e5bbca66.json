But they're also working on hundreds of experiments on the floating laboratory every day.\n\nOne recent experiment included mixing an aqueous solution with tricalcium silicate for the first time -- a scientific way of saying concrete. The basic ingredients for concrete include sand, gravel and rocks mixed with a cement powder and water-based paste. It sounds as easy as whipping up cake mix, but the actual process is much more difficult.\n\nAnd the lack of gravity changes everything.\n\nAstronauts participated in the Microgravity Investigation of Cement Solidification project to understand how the chemistry of concrete is changed by zero gravity, down to the microscopic structures inside it.\n\nRead More", "description": "You could say things are getting a little more concrete on the International Space Station.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190910144349-01-space-concrete-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
