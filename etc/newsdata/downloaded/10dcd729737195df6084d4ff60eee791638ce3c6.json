He said he was \u201cdefinitely ready\u201d to go 110 or 115 pitches, though, and he\u2019ll be ready to do the same Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhatever the team needs, I\u2019m ready to give it,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the Nationals crept toward the wild-card game, there was some discussion about whether Scherzer or Stephen Strasburg should start. Strasburg has been as durable and dominant this season as he has been in his career. That debate apparently only existed outside Nationals Park, as Scherzer said Saturday he and Manager Dave Martinez have been eyeing this situation \u201cfor a while.\u201d\n\nThomas Boswell: The Nats have been so good it\u2019s hard to figure out who to use in the NL wild-card game\n\nThey set up the rotation so Scherzer could pitch a potentially pivotal Game 162 but then the Nationals created separation in the wild card and watched the Chicago Cubs sink out of the race. This weekend\u2019s series became relevant only to the location of the playoff game, and with wins on Friday and Saturday, the Nationals ensured that either the Milwaukee Brewers or St. Louis Cardinals will be coming to Washington.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScherzer is now full-go for the one-game playoff. The two extra days of rest and the uncertainty of opponent don\u2019t change his normal routine between starts. He\u2019s pitched in 16 career postseason games, but never in the wild card. This doesn\u2019t faze him either because he doesn\u2019t see the setting as unfamiliar; it\u2019s just another elimination game.\n\n\u201cSeason\u2019s on the line\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cI\u2019ve pitched in these situations before and it\u2019s just crazy baseball. Intensity\u2019s out of your mind.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals will use Strasburg and left-handed starter Patrick Corbin out of the bullpen if necessary in the wild-card game. Scherzer has made three relief appearances in the postseason. The last one went haywire \u2014 an ill-fated, fifth-inning stretch against the Cubs in Game 5 of a 2017 National League Division Series which ultimately ended the Nationals\u2019 season \u2014 but Scherzer had provided his former team, the Detroit Tigers, with two solid trips out of the bullpen. He said teams\u2019 modern, aggressive approach on offense to swing early and often meant it shouldn\u2019t be too different an experience for Strasburg or Corbin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGuys are swinging at the first pitch more than ever now, so you have to be ready to get that first hitter out more so than ever,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really shouldn\u2019t be too much of a difference.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals hope Kurt Suzuki, Scherzer\u2019s favorite catcher, will be available Tuesday. The 35-year-old missed three weeks behind the plate with right elbow inflammation and returned Friday night. Suzuki looked fine hitting \u2014 he went 1 for 3 \u2014 but never had his arm tested. Martinez said Suzuki felt good Saturday morning except for his sore legs, which could be because he scored from first twice in his return \u2014 something he joked he hasn\u2019t done all season. Martinez said the Nationals could play Suzuki on Sunday as a final test, but they\u2019ll do everything they can to get him on the field: Scherzer has a 2.08 ERA in 99\u2154 innings with Suzuki and a 4.09 ERA in 72\u2154 innings with Yan Gomes.\n\nNo matter what happens, though, Scherzer specified it\u2019s key to embrace the energy on Tuesday. That\u2019s the advice he\u2019ll give young Nationals teammates in their first postseason, like outfielders Juan Soto and Victor Robles, when preparing them for the game.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to shy away from it, don\u2019t try to calm things down, don\u2019t make it any different,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cRise to the occasion, rise to the atmosphere. Use it. Use it to your advantage. In my first postseason, [veterans] were like, \u2018Slow everything down, slow everything down.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t work for me. It just doesn\u2019t. You learn quickly you rise to it.\"\n\nCleveland Indians (93-67)\n\nBradley Zimmer, CF\n\nFrancisco Lindor, SS\n\nJordan Luplow, LF\n\nFranmil Reyes, RF\n\nJake Bauers, 1B\n\nYu Chang, 3B\n\nEric Haase, C\n\nAndrew Velazquez, 2B\n\nAdam Plutko, RHP\n\nNationals (91-69)\n\nTrea Turner, SS\n\nAdam Eaton, RF\n\nAnthony Rendon, 3B\n\nJuan Soto, LF\n\nAsdr\u00fabal Cabrera, 2B\n\nRyan Zimmerman, 1B\n\nGerardo Parra, CF\n\nYan Gomes, C\n\nPatrick Corbin, LHP\n\nAD", "description": "The Nationals ace said he's back to full strength ahead of his start in the team's one-game playoff on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wRl2TcjzpFl19cLzPWJ310w9qC4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/34RBKUHBOYI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
