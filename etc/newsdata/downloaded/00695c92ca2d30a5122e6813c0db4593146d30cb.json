And we have a viable aircraft. We have volunteer pilots who are willing to make the trip,\" Daniels said.\n\n\"So we feel very strongly about helping those that can't help themselves at the moment. Hopefully, we'll make two round trips (Saturday), depending on weather,\" he said.\n\nMoving out to sea: Hurricane Dorian still 'raging' as airlifts begin in Outer Banks\n\nNo way in, or out:: Dorian's damage to Bahamas leaves survivors and rescue teams frustrated\n\nJeep memes: Dorian Jeep garners Internet fame \u2013 and bagpipes \u2013 after being abandoned on Myrtle Beach\n\nTico Belle is the flagship of the Valiant Air Command Warbird Museum in Titusville. The plane will join Brevard's Relief for the Bahamas, a coalition including the Florida Institute of Technology, ABC Supply of Central Florida, the Brevard County Clerk's Office and dozens of business partners.\n\nA countywide drive is funneling supplies to Hangar 4A off Aerospace Drive at the Melbourne airport. A Florida Tech-owned Panther Navajo aircraft flew thousands of pounds of goods to Sandy Point on three flights Thursday and Friday \u2014 including \"a big water run.\"\n\n\"Although it's a bad situation, they've set up a pretty orderly system. Customs is on the ground there, in a limited capacity,\" Miguel Estremera, the Panther Navajo co-pilot and 1998 Florida Tech aviation management graduate, said Friday afternoon.\n\n\"We went back today. There was an increased presence \u2014 a lot of civilians next to the airfield, looking to either get out or looking for supplies. The Bahamian police and the Bahamian defense force is there, keeping watch over the whole situation,\" Estremera said.\n\n\"They need water. They need the basic essentials. The sun was very hot, like it is here,\" he said.\n\nFlight time from Melbourne to Great Abaco Island is about 1 hour, Estremera said.\n\nInside Hangar 4A, volunteers are sorting and folding stacks of donated men's, women's and children's clothing. Pallets and boxes contain charcoal grills, Ramen noodles, baby wipes, bottled water, toilet paper, first aid supplies, elbow macaroni and an array of other goods.\n\n\"We're making a good dent. They're happy, and they want us back. It's getting directly into the hands of people \u2014 literally, boxes are coming out and they're handing them to folks that have been sitting on the sides of this airport,\" Estremera said.\n\nFollow Rick Neale on Twitter: @RickNeale1\n\nThis article originally appeared on Florida Today: Hurricane Dorian: WWII plane to fly to Bahamas to aid survivors", "description": "Volunteers will load up to 5,000 pounds of hurricane relief supplies aboard the warbird, which will take off for\u00a0Sandy Point on Great Abaco Island.", "authors": ["Rick Neale", "Florida Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Z95sjozGLhUxUNpIddZV3w--~B/aD0yNzY3O3c9NDQ0NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/7fa49240e341a22e222f28cec43e9889", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
