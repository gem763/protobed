As demonstrated by the latest revival of the Disney-spawned musical \u201cNewsies\u201d \u2014 beginning performances Nov. 1 at Arena Stage \u2014 the impact of the animation and theme-park giant has taken more nuanced turns than anyone could have predicted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor one thing, that occupation has not generated the complete corporate takeover of the musical-theater business that some imagined. Yes, costs have gone skyscraper-high, and more musicals than ever are spun (numbingly, uninspiringly) from well-known movies. But the important, Tony-winning musicals of the \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d/\u201cThe Band\u2019s Visit\u201d/\u201cHadestown\u201d variety still emerge from the dominions of personal vision and nonprofit theater.\n\nInstead of a takeover, a kind of uneasy, symbiotic relationship has taken hold. As the only major entertainment company that has managed to break through in a sustained way, Disney is now as entrenched in Broadway lore as any of the storied producers of yore. With 10 musicals under his belt, from durably dazzling \u201cThe Lion King\u201d to quirkily human-scale \u201cPeter and the Starcatcher,\u201d Thomas Schumacher, longtime head of Disney Theatrical Group, has earned the vaunted moniker \u201cimpresario.\u201d The Disney offerings have collectively run \u2014 on Broadway alone \u2014 for nearly 25,000 performances.\n\n\u201cOut of the box, we had two hits,\u201d Schumacher said as he sat in his glass cube of an office in the penthouse of Disney\u2019s own theater on West 42nd Street, the refurbished New Amsterdam. The initial one-two punch of \u201cBeauty\u201d in 1994 and \u201cLion King\u201d three years later sealed the company\u2019s pact with Broadway\u2019s burgeoning family and tourist markets. And, in the case of director Julie Taymor\u2019s puppet-enhanced \u201cLion King\u201d (now at more than 9,000 performances), it made inroads with doubters of Disney\u2019s interest in being innovation-forward.\n\n\u201cThe first is probably more in line with what you might have expected this company to do; and the second one is probably a surprise, although if you knew the players, me and Peter [Schneider, with whom he once ran the theatrical division], you wouldn\u2019t think that was so surprising at all,\u201d he said.\n\nThe quarter-century mark, a point at which Disney continues to explore new outlets for its stage productions around the globe, seemed a fitting time to sit down with the 61-year-old Schumacher to talk about the vast theatrical groundwork the company has laid, and where it might head next. Over the course of Schumacher\u2019s founding tenure at Disney Theatrical, where he presides over a workforce of 120, there have been numerous popular successes; the blockbuster of late being 2014\u2019s \u201cAladdin,\u201d which seems on course to be Disney\u2019s No. 2 hit, behind \u201cThe Lion King.\u201d But there have been notable Broadway misses, too, the worst being a ghastly \u201cTarzan\u201d adaptation in 2006, and a wackadoo short-lived \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d in 2008, with the actors playing underwater creatures in sneakers with wheels.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSchumacher said \u201cStarcatcher\u201d earned the most exuberant critical plaudits, while early notices for \u201cThe Lion King\u201d were not stellar. \u201cI would say every one\u2019s a surprise. But if they don\u2019t work, you\u2019re like, \u2018What the hell happened?\u2019 And if they really work you still go, \u2018What the hell happened?\u2019\u201d\n\nStill, a corporation\u2019s ability to scale up can be a boon even when Broadway fortunes, or the critics, or both, are unkind. \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d may have been ungainly in its initial form. \u201cBy the time we built it, everything became stiff and heavy. It was like watching furniture move,\u201d Schumacher says.\n\nBut Disney Theatrical\u2019s history of sticking with and reworking projects often paves the way to a happier financial ending \u2014 as has been the case with \u201cThe Little Mermaid.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been playing in Japan forever \u2014 there are two productions there.\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve played it all over Europe. . . . It\u2019s paid itself back and, no harm no foul, it lives on.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe company\u2019s staying power in the theater can also be traced to a flexibility in how and where it finds markets for its shows. Schumacher, a San Francisco Bay-area native who helped the stage visionary Peter Brook bring his 1985, nine-hour adaptation of \u201cThe Mahabharata\u201d to Los Angeles, has tried to pair Disney\u2019s film-to-stage productions with unlikely creative partners. There\u2019s Taymor, of course, with \u201cThe Lion King\u201d; Goodman Theatre\u2019s longtime artistic director Robert Falls, tapped for \u201cAida\u201d; and the British director Michael Grandage, who helmed \u201cFrozen.\u201d Similarly, he\u2019s found paths for his titles that may not even include Broadway.\n\n\u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d for instance, with a score by Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, Pulitzer Prize winners for \u201cNext to Normal,\u201d premiered three years ago at Arlington\u2019s Signature Theatre as a family-friendly show destined for licensing by other companies. It ended up also being filmed for the Disney Channel.\n\nAnd, just last month, 1997\u2019s animated \u201cHercules\u201d debuted in Central Park as a live production under the auspices of the Public Theater and rising off-Broadway director Lear deBessonet. With the absorption into the project of 200 amateur actors from around New York in the theater\u2019s Public Works initiative, it set in motion yet another model by which Disney could develop material.\n\nAccording to Schumacher, these notions of injecting patience into the task of finding and grooming audiences began with Walt Disney himself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMovies that were not successful in their time became successful over time,\u201d he said. He mentioned \u201cPinocchio\u201d and \u201cFantasia,\u201d which didn\u2019t make money initially but found their place in the American popular consciousness though theatrical rerelease and, eventually, the arrival of videocassettes.\n\n\u201cNewsies\u201d at Arena Stage seems as if it\u2019s yet another permutation of the formula. The convergence in this case is one of the nation\u2019s oldest and best-known nonprofit theaters, reviving a musical by the biggest commercial entity in the theater business. Molly Smith, who is directing the show \u2014 about a group of newsboys and girls who rise up against their exploitation by newspaper owners in turn-of-the-20th-century New York \u2014 says it was the theme, not the corporate pedigree, that attracted her.\n\n\u201cFor almost 20 years, I\u2019ve been directing the big gold-standard musicals, and now I wanted to shift to newer musicals that I think will stand the test of time,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I love about the project is that it\u2019s about a children\u2019s crusade and we\u2019re in the middle of two children\u2019s crusades, with the Parkland students [on gun control] and Greta Thunberg with climate change.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs for placing corporation-bred entertainment on Arena\u2019s Fichandler Stage, she adds: \u201cLook, we grew up on Disney, so it\u2019s very much part of the culture and who we are as Americans.\u201d\n\nTo Schumacher, \u201cNewsies\u201d is the ideal example of how a Disney show finds its own way. It started as a relatively modest venture at New Jersey\u2019s Paper Mill Playhouse. \u201cWe designed a set that could be broken down quickly, and be rented by people who might want to do it,\u201d he recalled. The notices were good, a New York theater suddenly became open, the audiences kept coming and a national tour set records. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s being done everywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong the many productions Schumacher has in development, there\u2019s a musical based on \u201cThe Princess Bride,\u201d the much obsessed-over 1987 movie. There\u2019s also a revival of the 2000 \u201cAida,\u201d to be directed by Schele Williams, one of the show\u2019s original cast members, and another incarnation of \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d slated for Britain. The $71 billion acquisition by Disney of 21st Century Fox\u2019s film and TV properties also provides a new source for potential material. Some of the films in that library, such as \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d and \u201cMrs. Doubtfire,\u201d are already licensed by outside producers for musicals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat is more than wishing upon a star. That is good business.\n\nNewsies, music by Alan Menken, lyrics by Jack Feldman, book by Harvey Fierstein. Directed by Molly Smith. $66-$133.
