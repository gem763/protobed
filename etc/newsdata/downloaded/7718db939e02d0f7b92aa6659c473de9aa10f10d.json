Most people would nip out the back, go \u201cRight I\u2019m finished,\u201d and put their dressing gown and slippers on, but she walked back down the red carpet, and hence was snapped by all the photographers.'\n\nHere she comes: The husband and wife co-hosts offered their opinion on photos taken during Jennifer Lopez' recent appearance in New York, where she was seen wearing a white dressing gown on the red carpet\n\nChortling alongside his wife, Eamonn, 59, joked that she was 'probably gong to the chippie,' prompting an oblivious Ruth to add: 'She's Jenny From The Block isn't she? She's keeping it real.'\n\nHowever there was no event, there were no photographers and the situation was far from real, with Jennifer simply wrapping up while taking a well earned break on the set of her latest film.\n\nMarry Me, is based on the Bobby Crosby's web comic in which a romantically desperate pop star sees a fan holding a 'Marry Me' sign and takes him up on the offer.\n\nHard at work: Worn over a sparking silver gown, the Latina star was merely taking a break while filming a glamorous scene on the set of her forthcoming film, Marry Me\n\nIn good company: Jennifer was joined by co-star Owen Wilson as she filmed her latest scenes\n\nJennifer plays leading lady, Kat Valdes, who is left at the altar by her rocker fiance, Bastian, played by Maluma.\n\nIt is at this chaotic wedding, held in Madison Square Garden, that she spots her fan, played by Wilson, in the crowd and makes him her groom.\n\nThe film is scheduled for release in 2020.", "description": "The husband and wife co-hosts offered their opinion on photos taken during Jennifer Lopez' recent appearance in her native New York.", "authors": ["Jason Chester For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/13/20130722-0-image-a-60_1571920127145.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
