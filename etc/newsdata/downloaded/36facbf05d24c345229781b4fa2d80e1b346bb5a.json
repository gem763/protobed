This was never the case.\"\n\nGoogle's post, published on August 29, said it was able to identify five separate iPhone exploit chains that worked on almost every operating-system version from iOS 10 to iOS 12, the current iPhone software. Google said that \"this indicated a group making a sustained effort to hack the users of iPhones in certain communities over a period of at least two years.\"\n\nApple's response, however, said that \"the sophisticated attack was narrowly focused, not a broad-based exploit of iPhones 'en masse' as described,\" adding that \"all evidence indicates that these website attacks were only operational for a brief period, roughly two months, not 'two years' as Google implies.\"\n\nApple added that it resolved the issue \"just 10 days after we learned about it\" in February.\n\n\"When Google approached us, we were already in the process of fixing the exploited bugs,\" Apple said.\n\nWe reached out to Google for comment, and the company provided the following statement:\n\n\"Project Zero posts technical research that is designed to advance the understanding of security vulnerabilities, which leads to better defensive strategies. We stand by our in-depth research which was written to focus on the technical aspects of these vulnerabilities. We will continue to work with Apple and other leading companies to help keep people safe online.\"\n\nApple has taken security and privacy very seriously in recent years, even leaning on those features to help it sell more devices like iPhones and Mac computers. Security is also a centerpiece of Apple's first credit card, the Apple Card, which launched last month.\n\nSo it's not surprising that Apple doesn't want Google to control the narrative of this particular exploit, since any publicity about iOS not being a solid ecosystem could cause some people to consider rival platforms, like Google's Android.\n\nYou can read Google's full blog post and Apple's response to that post to get the complete picture.", "description": "Apple released a statement on Friday in response to a Google blog post about iOS vulnerabilities that were fixed in February.", "authors": ["Dave Smith"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cb5dfee89551119335229ac-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
