It\u2019s well written. It\u2019s clear. The sentences are easy to read. Its point \u2015 that the president of the United States has undermined America\u2019s democracy \u2015 screams off the page.\n\nThe complaint is not only a strong argument for the impeachment of a president, it\u2019s just good writing, and it deserves a place in the canon of how to write well.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the first page.\n\nThe whistleblower (let\u2019s just call them WB) gets right to the heart of the matter.\n\n\u201cI am reporting an \u2018urgent concern,\u2019\u201d WB begins, addressed to Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairmen of their respective chamber\u2019s intelligence committees.\n\n\u201cUrgent concern\u201d evokes the gravity of the situation. It\u2019s an adjective and noun duo that is not messing around, forcing the addressees to lean in and pay close attention. The words are made even stronger by the quotation marks, which reveal that the phrase is pulled from the U.S. Constitution. Plus, \u201curgent concern\u201d was biting and catchy enough that it pervaded the conversation on the matter: Schiff parroted the phrase as he questioned acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire at Thursday\u2019s hearing on the complaint.\n\nTwo sentences later, WB provides succinct evidence to back up the thesis: There are witnesses who have observed the president abusing \u201cthe power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election.\u201d\n\nWB goes on to explain that it wasn\u2019t just Trump violating America\u2019s democracy. He had help. Rudolph Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, is a \u201ccentral figure.\u201d Attorney General William Barr is also involved.\n\nWB could have used a huge block of text to explain how Giuliani and Barr aided in election interference \u2015 an accusation of this magnitude requires a lot of evidence, after all. But this isn\u2019t the former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, with all its dense, legal lingo. WB wanted Burr and Schill to comprehend the stakes immediately, so WB broke the accusations down into easy-to-read bullet points.\n\nBullet points are a gift to readers, and WB knows this. It is hard to read a lot of words bunched up together without taking a break, and bullet points are the perfect solution. They are the punctuation equivalent of creating white space. The readers get a chance to take each one in and digest them.\n\nThese bullet points pack a punch. The first one establishes a timeline and sourcing: WB investigated and researched information about Trump\u2019s alleged misconduct for four months, gathering evidence from \u201chalf a dozen\u201d officials. The second makes clear that WB is not a firsthand witness. This is a vital piece of information that needed to be said upfront. If WB\u2019s witness status were revealed further down in the letter, it might cause Burr and Schiff to mistrust WB for not saying so sooner.\n\nThe third paragraph drives home that the allegations represent the \u201curgent concern\u201d cited in the Constitution, and drills down further into the legal implication. The president\u2019s actions are \u201ca violation of law.\u201d WB is reporting the wrongdoing because U.S. national security is at stake.\n\n\n\nThe rest of the letter goes on to provide more details and evidence, but the core information is right there on the first page in those first three paragraphs.\n\nThere is a thesis, a matter of \u201curgent concern.\u201d\n\nThere is evidence to back up the thesis. Who are the bad actors and what did they do?\n\nThere is a conclusion. The stakes are high. America\u2019s democracy is at great risk.\n\nWB got all of that on the first page. Taken together, the first three paragraphs provide the reader the who, what, where, when and why, the foundation of good writing taught from the get-go in elementary school classrooms across the country.\n\nThe thrust of the letter was to communicate, in clear and concise language so that the readers were not in the least bit confused, that the president was putting America\u2019s security in jeopardy with his actions.\n\nWho is this mystery writer? While his identity is still not public, The New York Times broke the news that he is a CIA officer \u201cwho is an analyst by training\u201d \u201csteeped in the details of American foreign policy\u201d with a \u201csophisticated understanding of Ukrainian politics.\u201d\n\nThe Times published this information, said editor Dean Baquet, because it goes to the whistleblower\u2019s credibility. That may be true. But the whistleblower\u2019s letter alone, with the force of his writing, already accomplished that, a conclusion reached by none other than the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general himself.", "description": "The complaint accusing President Donald Trump of misconduct should be held up as an exemplary example of how to write well.", "authors": ["Senior Enterprise Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8d083821000031005ecba7.jpeg?cache=fo8nbbrolz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
