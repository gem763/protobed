She said she wanted to inspire others to \"make their voices heard\".\n\n\"There is a huge gap in history where autistic people should be.\n\n\"Now we have an opportunity, a moment, to create an autistic revolution.\n\n\"I hope to ... create a discussion and a movement that allows for autistic people to be seen as equal and vital members of their communities, and as the unique and varied individuals they are.\"", "description": "Charlotte Amelia Poe, 30, has written a \"brutally honest\" account about living with the condition.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A3C5/production/_108652914_7635e587-da1b-4a4d-871c-90f0ec2f6b72.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
