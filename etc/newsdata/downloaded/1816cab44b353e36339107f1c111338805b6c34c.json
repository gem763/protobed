And if Germany's national cybersecurity agency is to be believed, the most secure browser you could use is Firefox.\n\nWhen the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) conducted an audit of web browsers lately, Mozilla's Firefox was the only on that received top marks.\n\nThe audit included tests of Firefox 68, Google Chrome 76, Microsoft Internet Explorer 11, and Microsoft Edge 44. It did not however include Safari, Brave, Opera, or Vivaldi. It included tests to ascertain that these browsers were within guidelines the BSI released in September, which it uses to advise government agencies and private sector companies about.\n\nDon't Miss 199 SHARES 198.5 K SHARES 49.4 K SHARES 16.6 K SHARES\n\nHaving first published this secure browser guide in 2017, the BSI has since updated the list of necessary security measures. To be considered secure, a modern browser has to have a number of back-end and user-focused security features, including indicators when communication to a remote site is encrypted or not, support for HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), singed and verifiable browser updates, and the ability to delete browsing history.\n\nYou can find the whole list here.\n\nApparently Firefox was the only browser to meet all the requirements. So if you're actually a fan of a different brand, now might be the time to switch over for your own safety.", "description": "People usually choose browsers based on how convenient they are.
