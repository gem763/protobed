Entering the fall months outside the top three spots in the polls, Buttigieg\u2019s campaign is betting again on that transparency, and a rush of headlines and social media posts from reporters transcribing all of his on-the-bus musings, to boost him in Iowa and draw a strong contrast with other candidates less inclined to engage the media.\n\nBut more than the media landscape has shifted in the two decades since McCain\u2019s free-wheeling, print-chronicled campaign. Buttigieg\u2019s careful, professorial manner of speaking is far removed from the late Arizona senator\u2019s bombast and salty language that made him a media sensation. Buttigieg isn\u2019t a \u201clet his hair down and vamp kind of candidate,\u201d said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist who sat shotgun on McCain\u2019s 2000 campaign bus tour.\n\nButtigieg, though, pushed back on the suggestion that he isn\u2019t as loose as McCain. \u201cMaybe one of you just needs to get a rise out of me,\u201d he said on the Monday morning ride to Waterloo to Elkader, Iowa. (No one did.) He added that McCain, then a veteran senator, \u201cregaled\u201d the press \u201cwith stories of other senators,\u201d but said, \u201cI\u2019m not here to educate you on the ways of Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can push my buttons,\u201d he added. Lis Smith, Buttigieg\u2019s senior communications adviser, laughed: \u201cYou can try.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg boards his campaign bus in Iowa. | Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nWhen asked, Buttigieg said the last thing that made him yell was a football game.\n\n\u201cMcCain was ruthlessly honest, and that\u2019s why it worked. He was not one who minced words or chose them carefully. So, to make a Straight Talk Express work, you need to be forthright,\u201d said David Axelrod, the chief strategist for former President Barack Obama\u2019s campaigns. \u201cNot that Pete is not forthright, but he chooses his words carefully.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may not have the same galvanic effect,\u201d Axelrod said.\n\nOn the bus, a clutch of 10 or so traveling reporters, crushed together on leather seats, pecked away at their laptops and phones as they peppered Buttigieg with questions over the last three days. The moment he answered a query \u2014 including what he\u2019d be if not an elected official (\u201ca literary critic at some university\u201d), the nickname he picked up in Afghanistan when buddies found out he was a mayor (\u201chonorable lieutenant\u201d), and the sport most comparable to politics (\u201cfootball provides the most analogies\u201d) \u2014 those answers appeared on Twitter.\n\nThe prolonged exposure yielded a range of on-the-record conversations that meandered from his criticism of Medicare for All proponents\u2019 clearness about how they would pay for the program to the views of the philosopher John Rawls, and then to the nagging question of \u201celectability\u201d in the 2020 primary.\n\n\u201cI remember so many conversations in Indiana, when Obama was emerging, it was always the same thing: \u2018I think it\u2019s great, but I\u2019m not sure if the world is ready for this or if my neighbor is ready for this,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI know people are having the same conversations about me, and I think we have a pretty good answer for that.\u201d\n\nButtigieg is competing against a media cycle driven by President Donald Trump, whose move to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden has dominated the news conversation in recent days. All 2020 candidates are looking to break through in new-fangled ways, from Elizabeth Warren\u2019s thousands of post-event selfies to Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s live-streaming. Even Cory Booker transparently laid out his fundraising woes, begging for $1.7 million to keep his campaign going.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to cut through a lot of noise,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cOne way to do that is to make sure that we\u2019re having a direct conversation in a different way than the others can do.\u201d\n\nJoin our reporters for live coverage of the U.N. General Assembly 9AM on SEPT. 24 for live coverage of the U.N. General Assembly LIVE\n\nButtigieg is hoping to peel away at former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s supporters in much the same manner that McCain sought to be the \u201cmainstream GOP alternative\u201d to then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in New Hampshire, opening up all-access line to the press to compete with Bush\u2019s financial lead. He\u2019s positioning himself to be \u201cBiden\u2019s understudy,\u201d said Murphy, adding that, \u201clike McCain, [Buttigieg] is picking his shots.\u201d\n\n\"There's a contrast between a candidate who\u2019s willing to surround himself with reporters 24/7 and a candidate whose interactions with the media are carefully managed,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to avoid the contrast, and I assume that\u2019s intentional.\"\n\nButtigieg acknowledged that he and Biden are \u201ccompeting for a lot of the same folks\u201d in the primary. He added: \u201cPart of what\u2019ll shift that my way is when folks start thinking about electability in a way that\u2019s consistent with history, because right now there\u2019s still, I think, a sense that the most familiar face is the most electable face.\"\n\nButtigieg used the \u201cfamiliar face\u201d line frequently while stumping throughout Iowa this week. And it\u2019s starting to show up in polling. A Des Moines Register/CNN survey found Warren surging to a slim advantage in the first caucus state, with Biden in second place. Buttigieg had 9 percent support in the poll but boasted some of the best favorability numbers. On the bus, Buttigieg said the poll \u201cshows we\u2019re in the hunt.\u201d\n\nButtigieg is also spending seven-figures on a TV and digital ad blitz there, introducing himself in a series of biographical ads.\n\n\u201cWhen people see Pete for the first time, all of a sudden, they pick their heads up and listen and everything changes,\u201d said Mayor Ryan Arndorfer of Britt, Iowa, who endorsed Buttigieg last week and came to see him in Iowa Falls.\n\nPete Buttigieg speaks to reporters on his bus following a campaign stop in Webster, Iowa. | Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThe conversation on the bus occasionally turned personal. Buttigieg said Chasten, his husband, is \u201cready to be a dad\u201d and the couple would have kids while in the White House, if things get that far. And on Jacob Wohl, the Republican provocateur who tried to smear Buttigieg with a false sexual assault allegation, Buttigieg said, \u201cThe biggest thing on my mind was a sense of relief that it was so obviously a sham.\u201d\n\nTo deal with it, though, Buttigieg said he had to \u201cdo a lot of compartmentalizing.\u201d\n\nBut the dialogue cut deepest on the shooting in South Bend, when a white police officer shot and killed a black man in June. Buttigieg acknowledged that he was \u201cso focused on making sure that I just did my duty to not take a side and to get information out that I missed a chance to show my level of resonance with why people were upset.\u201d\n\nAs the police union pressured Buttigieg to defend the officer and activists pressured him to fire the officer, \u201cinevitably it feels like you\u2019re not registering the moral and emotional power of what\u2019s going on\u201d when you\u2019re stuck in the middle, Buttigieg said. \u201cWhat\u2019s really happening is you\u2019re registering all of it, and it\u2019s tearing you up.\u201d\n\nButtigieg acknowledged his campaign has been weak appealing to minority voters, but he said that as \u201cthe white candidate most likely to be asked questions about race,\u201d there is \u201can opportunity in that, especially if I can use that as a way to talk to white people to have a conversation about race that many white people are not ready to have.\u201d\n\nButtigieg did take a break from the press by hopping on Twitter on Monday afternoon. What was scheduled as a 15-minute Twitter question-and-answer turned into a 45-minute conversation between Buttigieg and his supporters, organized via the hashtag #ButtigiegBusTour.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trending,\u201d Buttigieg said casually, a few questions in.\n\n\u201cGood work,\u201d Smith said, looking over Buttigieg\u2019s shoulder as he scrolled through his mentions. Later, Smith advised Buttigieg to add the hashtag to \u201cjuice\u201d its chances of jumping higher on the trends list, while Buttigieg trolled a reporter\u2019s music taste via tweet, as they sat less than three feet apart from each other on the bus.\n\n\u201cIf anyone wanted to know how this bus tour would be different from 1999,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nThe reporters on the bus sat silently, staring at their phones.", "description": "The buttoned-down mayor opened his campaign bus in an homage to John McCain, a challenge to Joe Biden and a play to break open the 2020 race.", "authors": ["Elena Schneider"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8d/cf/7b8b7858494e9b63aa2da2ae7664/190923-pete-bus-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
