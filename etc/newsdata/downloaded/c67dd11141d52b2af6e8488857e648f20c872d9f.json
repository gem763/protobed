Formally he is only a backbench MP, but in reality he is Poland's de facto ruler \u2014 he hires and fires prime ministers and chose President Andrzej Duda for the job.\n\n\u201cThat system that existed before, where the fruits of growth were not equally divided \u2026 that system has in large measure been corrected\u201d \u2014 Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, PiS leader\n\nHe\u2019s had an enormous impact on Poland's economy, politics, society and foreign relations. The question is whether his footprints will last or be washed away by deeper social changes transforming Poland.\n\nThanks to a mix of good luck and a boost in spending, Kaczy\u0144ski has presided over the most prosperous period in Polish history. Unemployment is at a record low, growth rates are among the highest in Europe, and a massive jump in welfare benefits has made millions of Poles wealthier (and keener to vote for PiS).\n\nThe government now plays a much larger role in the economy \u2014 dominating banking, energy, mining and chemicals \u2014 and PiS has purged state-controlled companies, the government bureaucracy, some courts and the state-run media \u2014 replacing thousands with party loyalists.\n\nA booming economy has been wrapped in the flag and the cross \u2014 a mix of national pride, traditional values and fatter wallets that gives PiS 47 percent support in POLITICO's poll of polls, leaving its rivals in the dust.\n\nPOLAND NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\n\u201cThat system that existed before, where the fruits of growth were not equally divided \u2026 that system has in large measure been corrected,\u201d Kaczy\u0144ski told the picnic in July.\n\nDivide and conquer\n\nOne of the models Kaczy\u0144ski cites as a formative influence is J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski \u2014 the charismatic leader who helped restore Polish independence in 1918.\n\nLike Kaczy\u0144ski, Pi\u0142sudski was thin-skinned and prone to railing against what he described as feckless politicians and elites. He had no patience for rules and procedures and staged a coup in 1926, then pushed a mix of watered-down socialism and national pride based on the idea that Poland was a great power.\n\nIn a 2017 letter to his supporters, Kaczy\u0144ski called Pi\u0142sudski \"one of the most remarkable characters in European politics\" and added that he saw himself \"as a continuator of his thought \u2014 of course in very different circumstances.\"\n\nJust like his hero, Kaczy\u0144ski has deeply divided Poland. In the four years since the last election, he's worked to undermine the political consensus that existed since the end of communism in 1989. He's a majoritarian democrat \u2014 meaning he believes in elections, but has the view that the winning party should be untrammelled by independent institutions like the law courts.\n\n\u201cKaczy\u0144ski not only questioned the liberal consensus, he took steps to counteract it,\u201d said Micha\u0142 Szu\u0142drzy\u0144ski, deputy editor of the conservative Rzeczpospolita newspaper.\n\nIn much the same way that Brexit has split the U.K. and Donald Trump has polarized the U.S., Kaczy\u0144ski has heightened his country\u2019s divisions. Almost half of the electorate loves him, a similar number despise him \u2014 few are ambivalent.\n\nThe joke when Donald Tusk, the current president of the European Council, was prime minister from 2007 to 2014 was that his main concern was warm water in the tap \u2014 meaning he wanted things to be calm and predictable. Under Kaczy\u0144ski, the water in Polish taps runs boiling hot.\n\nHe\u2019s a politician who thrives on conflict. It was Kaczy\u0144ski who helped splinter the union of democratic parties that bested the communists in 1989. He blew up his short-lived 2005-2007 government by turning on his smaller coalition partners.\n\nHe turned the 2010 air disaster that killed his twin brother, President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, into political rocket fuel by implying that there was some sort of conspiracy behind what investigators found was an accident. What had briefly been a moment of national unity over the tragedy became a chasm that still splits the country.\n\nFrom 2015, despite PiS holding the presidency and an absolute majority in parliament, Kaczy\u0144ski was unwilling to move within the confines of the law and convention by slowly appointing judges more to his liking. Instead, he launched a frontal attack on the judicial system that has turned Poland into a pariah in the EU.\n\n\"There will be no gay marriage and especially the adoption of children\" \u2014 Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski\n\nThe same thing happened in parliament. There PiS has the votes to get any piece of legislation it wants adopted, but rather than follow procedure, the party rams through important bills in just days, sometimes limiting opposition comments to speeches lasting just 30 seconds.\n\nIn the current election campaign, Kaczy\u0144ski aims to galvanize his voters by focusing hostility against LGBT people as enemies of traditional Polish values.\n\n\"There will be no gay marriage and especially the adoption of children,\" Kaczy\u0144ski told a party rally last month. \"Instead, in Poland there will be freedom, freedom not limited by political correctness.\"\n\nAlthough Kaczy\u0144ski has built his political power on an appeal to traditional values, there's little that's traditional about the man himself. He's a lifelong bachelor who lives in a family house in a north Warsaw suburb with his cats \u2014 Fiona, Czaru\u015b and occasionally Feliks. He's alone now. His lifelong attachments were to his twin brother \u2014 his death left Kaczy\u0144ski in shock and on medication \u2014 and his mother, who died in 2013. Late at night, he unwinds by himself, watching rodeos on TV.\n\nIron fist\n\nEven as Kaczy\u0144ski divided Poland along ideological lines, he has made sure PiS stayed united behind him. His departure would likely trigger a power struggle between competing factions of his party.\n\nSince creating PiS with his twin brother Lech in 2001, he\u2019s ruled it with an iron fist, building it into a party that spans from the center right to the extremes of Polish nationalism \u2014 united primarily by the force of his personality and the exercise of personal power.\n\nKaczy\u0144ski has never allowed an independent baron to arise within the party \u2014 anyone who gets too powerful is quickly cut down to size. Rebels are expelled. The obsequious rise, but last only as long as they don\u2019t challenge the leader.\n\nHis power over his followers was demonstrated a few weeks ago, when senior figures from the party tripped over themselves in their eagerness to say that he\u2019d make a much better prime minister than the current incumbent Mateusz Morawiecki \u2014 handpicked by Kaczy\u0144ski for the job.\n\n\u201cKaczy\u0144ski created PiS as a very broad tent. It only functions because of his authority\" \u2014 Micha\u0142 Szu\u0142drzy\u0144ski, deputy editor of the conservative Rzeczpospolita newspaper\n\nEven Morawiecki joined in, saying: \u201cI think that Chairman Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski would be superb and the best prime minister.\u201d\n\nThose ritual displays of subservience would end once Kaczy\u0144ski lets go of the reins.\n\n\u201cKaczy\u0144ski created PiS as a very broad tent. It only functions because of his authority,\u201d Szu\u0142drzy\u0144ski said. \u201cWithout him, its internal contradictions will tear it apart.\u201d\n\nA post-Kaczy\u0144ski era would set off a scramble for power that could shatter the party.\n\nThe top three contenders seen as likeliest to wage a battle to take over the party are Morawiecki, Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro and former Interior Minister and current MEP Joachim Brudzi\u0144ski.\n\nMorawiecki, a former banker who was once an adviser to Tusk, is seen as a pro-business centrist without deep roots in the party. Ziobro, who is both justice minister and chief prosecutor, runs Poland's deep state and is a right-winger closely allied to conservative Roman Catholic groups. But he had a falling out with Kaczy\u0144ski a decade ago and the party faithful still view him with mistrust. The closest to Kaczy\u0144ski is Brudzi\u0144ski, but he lacks his boss's charisma, and now in Brussels he's removed from the power center of Warsaw.\n\nNone of the contenders to replace Kaczy\u0144ski are able to command a similar loyalty in the ranks. Anyone formally taking over Law and Justice would likely see defeated rivals setting up their own parties. Others, like Deputy Prime Minister Jaros\u0142aw Gowin, who heads a small center-right party that forms part of the PiS coalition, would probably try their chances at the polls on their own.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be a simple takeover,\u201d said Norbert Maliszewski, a political scientist at the Cardinal Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski University in Warsaw. \u201cThere are too many rival factions, so the likeliest result would be a large rump of PiS and a smaller constellation of rival parties.\u201d\n\nDeep changes\n\nWhat happens to PiS, and to Poland, will define Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s legacy, and determine whether his mix of national pride, traditional values and government-backed economic growth will survive him.\n\nPoland is one of the world's best economic performers \u2014 it last saw a recession in 1992. But Trump's trade war, the impact of Brexit and a slowdown in Europe could pose a risk to growth and jeopardize PiS's expensive social programs.\n\nPolish society is also modernizing quickly in its attitudes \u2014 a process that continues undeterred by PiS's appeal to traditional values.\n\nDespite the government's close alliance with the Catholic Church, Poland is secularizing fast. A survey of 18- and 19-year-olds by the CBOS organization found that 63 percent believed or deeply believed in God in 2018, down from 81 percent in 2008.\n\nAnother survey out in the spring found that 58 percent of Poles support a woman's right to an abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy (something completely at odds with the country's tough abortion laws). The latest Eurobarometer poll found that 49 percent of Poles feel homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. That's significantly less than in Western Europe, but up 12 percentage points since 2015.\n\n\"Kaczy\u0144ski was able to bring along a part of Polish society that had felt abandoned\" \u2014 Aleksander Smolar, head of the Stefan Batory Foundation\n\nKaczy\u0144ski built a good chunk of his appeal on opposition to immigration; fanning fears of Muslim migrants helped win the elections in 2015. Today, however, Poland is the EU's migration magnet \u2014 issuing 59 percent of the bloc's work permits for non-EU citizens, according to Eurostat. The overwhelming majority of those go to Ukrainians, but there's a growing number of arrivals from elsewhere (Indians came third after Ukrainians and Belarusians).\n\nThese trends in demography and opinion could cause many Poles to look back unfavorably on a leader who pushed in the opposite direction.\n\nBut there\u2019s also the chance that Kaczy\u0144ski will be remembered fondly. Paradoxically, he could be seen as the man who completed Poland's modernization project, said Aleksander Smolar, head of the Stefan Batory Foundation, a Warsaw think tank.\n\nThe post-1989 rush to ditch communism and build a market economy left many people behind \u2014 especially in smaller towns and villages. Throwing open Poland\u2019s doors to Western values also alienated many \u2014 principally in the more conservative east.\n\nIt was the mix of populist economic policies and national pride pushed by Kaczy\u0144ski that provided those people the feeling that they were included in the mainstream.\n\n\"Kaczy\u0144ski was able to bring along a part of Polish society that had felt abandoned,\" Smolar said.\n\nThat seems to be the way Kaczy\u0144ski would like to be remembered. Speaking at the picnic rally in July, he promised that Poles would catch up to Western Europe \u2014 and they'd do it on their own terms.\n\nHe pledged that Poles will be able to say: \u201cIt happened, we are a wealthy country, in no way worse than those in the West, and on top of that we have equality.\"\n\n\"To achieve that we don\u2019t have to copy those in the West,\" he added. \"We don\u2019t have to stand under the rainbow flag, but under Poland\u2019s red and white banner.\u201d", "description": "The PiS leader is preparing to step aside, but his party might not survive the ensuing power struggle.", "authors": ["Jan Cienski", "Zosia Wanat", "Eddy Wax"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/poland_jaroslaw354x236-1200x628.jpg"}
