But early on, Rodgers-Cromartie limped off the field and, though he returned, he played hurt the rest of the game. The Athletic reported the veteran tore ligaments in his ankle. He also limped off in Week 1 against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nRodgers-Cromartie became the 10th Redskin this season to land on IR.\n\nSpence, meanwhile, spent three seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Redskins hope the 2016 second-rounder can boost their pass rush. Washington has just two sacks in two games this season. While Spence went without a sack in 2018, he recorded 5 1/2 his rookie year.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
