Since assuming office, he has embarked on a high-energy, but risky strategy to break the stalemate.\n\nUkraine\u2019s war began in early 2014, a few weeks after pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych fled the country. The fighting that ensued has killed thousands and although the conflict has died down since the peaks of 2014 and 2015, sporadic battles remain, especially around hotspots in the east like the town of Zolote.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The so-called Steinmeier formula is controversial in certain sections of Ukrainian society, who say it goes too far in granting autonomy and amnesty to former Russian backed separatist fighters. Critics, like the former president Petro Poroshenko, described it as a \u201ccapitulation\u201d and street protests followed across the entire country, with thousands turning out in the capital.\n\nThe pullback in Zolote and two other towns in Luhansk region were also agreed as part of the Steinmeier settlement on 1 October.\n\nAlmost immediately, several dozen soldiers from Ukraine\u2019s Azov battalion, an infamous far-right military structure, made their way down to Zolote to protest against Mr Zelensky\u2019s \u201cconfidence-boosting\u201d measures on the front line. Setting up an impromptu \u201clast checkpoint\u201d in the town, they said they would do everything to stop the pullback.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Zelensky felt compelled to travel to Zolote to confront the soldiers in person.\n\nFew pleasantries were exchanged. In one dramatic dialogue, recorded by local TV networks, the president said the soldiers were taking him for a fool.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t issue me ultimatums,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the president of this country. I am 42 years old. I\u2019m no sucker. I came here to tell you to move your weapons away from the front line.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We saw moves to pull back in 2014 and 2015 too. It always led to needless blood being spilled.\u201d\n\nMaks Levin, a Ukrainian journalist who saw the standoff between Mr Zelensky and Azov in Zolote, told The Independent that he saw many local residents pleading with the soldiers to stay. The pullback would move front lines beyond sniper range, but leave the town itself in no man\u2019s land.\n\n\u201cMany fear Russian-backed forces will take up new positions in town,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who have pro-Ukrainian views worry about revenge attacks.\u201d\n\nMr Levin cautioned the withdrawal might not yet go ahead as planned. Some other units in Ukraine\u2019s regular army positioned in Zolote did not agree with the president\u2019s position, he said; they \u201cmay offer resistance\u201d. Things would \u201ccertainly\u201d take a turn for the worse if any of the now unarmed Azov fighters were injured.\n\nAt the weekend, Andrei Biletsky, Azov\u2019s first leader, threatened to send 10,000 fighters to Zolote to defend \u201cpositions won in blood\u201d.\n\nA key player to watch in the forthcoming weeks is Arsen Avakov, Ukraine\u2019s interior minister.\n\nThe lone survivor from Mr Poroshenko\u2019s government \u2013 by some accounts considered too powerful to move \u2013 Mr Avakov dominates much of Ukraine\u2019s security bloc. Of particular interest to this story is the fact he has a controlling stake in both the Azov diehards and the national guard that came to town to disarm them.\n\nIn other words, said Andrei Dikhtaryenko, editor of the local Realnaya Gazeta newspaper, it was \u201cas if Mr Avakov\u2019s right hand was disarming his left hand\u201d.\n\nSome interpret Mr Avakov\u2019s manoeuvres as a sign of internal conflict in the new administration.\n\n\u201cMany of Zelensky\u2019s close advisers already suspect Avakov of playing a double game,\u201d said Volodymyr Fesenko, an independent political analyst based in Kiev. \u201cAvakov showed him how indispensable he was in providing security in Zolote. But he risks undermining any trust Zelensky has in him.\u201d\n\nHalf a year into his role, Mr Zelensky has clearly moved beyond his electoral honeymoon.\n\nSky-high approval ratings are beginning to take a tumble. Still in the mid-sixties, they remain higher than any president in Ukraine\u2019s modern history. But the terrain ahead is rocky. Not only is Mr Zelensky invested in a high-risk, low-patience strategy to end the war, he is also embroiled in the middle of a US election campaign and an impeachment process.\n\nThere is little room for error and much of Mr Zelensky\u2019s success now depends on the willingness of Vladimir Putin to play ball.\n\n\u201cIrrationally, emotionally, Zelensky believes he can solve everything in a face-to-face meeting with Putin,\u201d Mr Fesenko said. \u201cHe thinks he can get a compromise like he managed with the prisoner exchange.\u201d\n\nA rush for a deal would probably be welcomed in Moscow, the foreign policy expert Vladimir Frolov suggested.\n\n\u201cImpatience is always a virtue for Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cThey use it to force peace on their own terms.\u201d", "description": "Vadym\u00a0Prystaiko, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister,\u00a0announced on Tuesday that Kiev had finally begun the process of pulling back troops in the eastern town of Zolote.
