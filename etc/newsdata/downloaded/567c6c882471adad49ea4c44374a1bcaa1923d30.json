No longer is CNBC television covering Bitcoin three times in one day; the number of headlines mentioning \u201ccrypto\u201d has collapsed.\n\nYet, there still seems to be some underlying positive press for this market being pushed through mainstream channels.\n\nIn a recent Bloomberg Opinion article, Jarden Dillian, an editor and investment strategist, laid out why he believes that Bitcoin is ready to see a bull run that will be larger than the last.\n\nBigger Bull Run Than the Last\n\nIn the piece, Dillian took some time to explain why he believes that a \u201csystem of stateless currencies\u201d, which many say will be centered around an asset like Bitcoin, is needed.\n\nAs he wrote, the \u201cphilosophical bias\u201d of governmental currencies has never been as weak as it is now, looking to the immense levels of debt that the fiat system has racked up. Indeed, the world\u2019s debt to GDP ratio has hit some 320%, far above what it was prior to the Great Recession of 2008, and the U.S. is on track to have a $1 trillion fiscal deficit for 2019. Crazy.\n\nWhile debts are supposed to be repaid in full, governments, Dillian writes, are shifting to a model known as Modern Monetary Theory, \u201cor the printing of as much cash as a government needs to fund its spending.\u201d\n\nThis transition, he claims, will be astronomically bullish for Bitcoin, as \u201cit just seems like common sense that you would want to avoid any currency (most of the fiat world) that is being debased to such a degree.\u201d\n\nThe analyst \u2014 after mentioning Bitcoin\u2019s characteristics of decentralization, scarcity, censorship-resistance/privacy, and cost-efficiency \u2014 then concluded that writing that he believes Bitcoin will see another bull market, one that is \u201cmuch larger than the first one where the potential is finally realized\u201d. As Dillian remarked:\n\n\u201cIf you believe that Bitcoin has a future, then the math is simple. If you assume that only 0.5% of the population has adopted it, and that there are only 16 million to 17 million BTC available, then as adoption inevitably increases the price of Bitcoin will rise significantly.\u201d\n\nBloomberg Opinion Is All Over Bitcoin\n\nDillian isn\u2019t the first Bloomberg Opinion writer to have accentuated that there is a rapidly-growing fundamental need for Bitcoin. Per previous reports from NewsBTC, Tyler Cowen has recently started to renege on his former belief that Bitcoin is only as worth as much as its marketing, has immense volatility issues, amongst other critiques.\n\nThe economist, who contributes to Bloomberg\u2019s opinion column, first wrote in 2017 that Bitcoin could be used as a good way for risk-averse investors to hedge their wealth, likening the cryptocurrency to gold.\n\nCowen\u2019s journey to believer finished just recently, when he unveiled an article titled \u201cBitcoin is (Probably) Here to Stay\u201d. In this sweeping piece, he laid out the following four reasons why he believes that the leading cryptocurrency has immense staying power in today\u2019s society:\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war, which pushes Chinese investors to find their way into safe havens. A left-leaning (economics-wise) political climate in the U.S., which may lead investors to store their value away from authorities (IRS). The launch of Libra, which Cowen believes increases the survivability of cryptocurrency. Hedge against uncertainty.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Now that the Bitcoin market has cooled from its emotional top in late-June, when BTC topped $14,000, mainstream media coverage of the cryptocurrency", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_732185554-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
