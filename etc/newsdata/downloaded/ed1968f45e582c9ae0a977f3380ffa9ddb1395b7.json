We know, for example, that the two-run homer Altuve, the Houston Astros\u2019 second baseman, hit on that pitch from Glasnow, the Tampa Bay Rays\u2019 right-hander, traveled 358 feet with an exit velocity of 98.7 mph and a launch angle of 29 degrees.\n\nBut occasionally, it is worth our while to step back from our sabermetric bubble and remind ourselves: Some of these feats, and some of these athletes, are absolutely incredible.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFriday afternoon, in the Astros\u2019 6-2 win over the Rays at Houston\u2019s Minute Maid Park, was a good time to do that. Altuve is a modern marvel of physiology, a 5-foot-6 bundle of fast-twitch muscle and sinew, with what \u2014 logic tells you even if there isn\u2019t yet a stat for it \u2014 must be some of the fastest hands known to mankind.\n\nTo catch up to those pitches and to drive them over the wall, out of that undersized body \u2014 as Altuve, the 2017 AL MVP, did 31 times this regular season and as he has done 137 times, regular and postseason combined, in his career \u2014 could not otherwise be physically possible. That 97.5 mph fastball wasn\u2019t even the hardest gas Altuve has gone deep against this year; last month, he turned around a 99 mph heater.\n\nJose Altuve, we remind ourselves again, you are remarkable.\n\nAD\n\nFor that matter, so are you, Justin Verlander.\n\nAD\n\nMLB playoff bracket and schedule\n\nOn Friday, the Astros\u2019 36-year-old ace \u2014 the oldest player on either team \u2014 carried a no-hitter into the fifth inning and settled for seven shutout innings, a representative performance at the end of a Cy Young-caliber regular season. Verlander struck out eight, never allowed a runner past first base and departed with a six-run lead.\n\nOnly after Verlander left did things get interesting, with the Rays scoring twice off Astros reliever Ryan Pressley in the eighth and bringing the tying run to the on-deck circle before set-up man Will Harris entered and retired Ji-Man Choi on a grounder to third.\n\nAnd so, the AL West champion Astros, who led the majors with 107 wins, made an emphatic opening statement to their 2019 postseason, which they entered as the consensus pick to win it all. Days like Friday remind us of why that is so.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLocked in a scoreless tie for 4 \u00bd innings against an excellent team \u2014 the Rays won 96 games in the cutthroat AL East and beat Oakland in the wild-card game Tuesday night \u2014 and facing one of the hardest-throwing starters in the game in Glasnow, the Astros simply outlasted their opponent, waiting for them to make a couple of mistakes, then pouncing when they did.\n\nA critical mistake came in the fifth, four batters after Altuve\u2019s homer, when Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel hit a pop-up into the area near the foul line in shallow right. Three Rays defenders converged, but the ball glanced off the glove of second baseman Brandon Lowe \u2014 a play ruled an error, with two runs crossing the plate.\n\nJust as we need to step back sometimes and admire the abilities of players like Altuve and Verlander, we should also take a moment to gaze in wonder at the Astros. Even in the turbo-charged atmosphere of 2019 baseball, with its stratified standings and an outrageous home run pace, they stood out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf the Astros were to win 10 more games this month, and thus claim their second World Series title in three years, they may be remembered as one of the greatest teams in a generation. Their run-differential of plus-280, for example, is the most by any team since the 116-win Seattle Mariners of 2001. Their 288 homers would have been a major league record \u2014 except the Minnesota Twins and New York Yankees also broke the old mark, and hit 307 and 306, respectively.\n\nAt a time when the strikeout reigns supreme across the industry as the ultimate difference-maker, the Astros became the first team in history to lead the league from both sides: their pitchers struck out the most hitters, while their hitters struck out the fewest times in the majors.\n\nIn the Year of the Home Run, the Cardinals-Braves NLDS opener is a game of inches\n\nThere have been all-star lineups that weren\u2019t as potent as the Astros\u2019, which on Friday featured seven hitters with an OPS (on-base plus slugging) above .875 and an OPS+ (adjusted for park and league effects) of 125 \u2014 meaning their production was at least 25 percent above league-average.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd we mean that literally about the all-star lineups. The nine starters for the NL in the 2014 All-Star Game, which included a designated hitter, had an average OPS that season of .879. The nine Astros starters on Friday had an average OPS of .907 \u2013 led by the 1.067 of phenom DH Yordan Alvarez, the runaway front-runner for AL rookie of the year, and 1.015 of third baseman Alex Bregman, a leading candidate for MVP.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean the Astros can\u2019t lose the next three games and get sent home shockingly early \u2014 they somehow lost seven straight at one point in June \u2014 but the way their rotation sets up it is almost impossible to envision.\n\nHaving faced Verlander in Game 1, the Rays\u2019 task gets no easier. In Saturday\u2019s Game 2, the Astros will send to the mound the second of their twin aces \u2014 right-hander Gerrit Cole, who is also the only pitcher in the same discussion with Verlander for the AL Cy Young Award, which, when it is announced next month, will either be Verlander\u2019s second or Cole\u2019s first. Oh, and Game 3 will be started by Zack Greinke, who also owns a Cy Young and who went 8-1 with a 3.02 ERA after being acquired from Arizona at the trade deadline.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs an organization, the Astros are known throughout the sport as the most ruthlessly devoted to analytics and technology \u2014 a trait that can make them appear from the outside as cold and robotic.\n\nBut sometimes it is best to forget all that and simply admire the collection of players the Astros have assembled \u2014 who come in all shapes and sizes but almost uniformly share one trait: they are very good at baseball.\n\nRead more on baseball:\n\nDodgers highlight a critical problem: Nats still lack a trustworthy third bullpen arm\n\nOrioles players thank fans with handwritten notes after another brutal season\n\nHouston\u2019s mattress king bets $3.5 million on Astros to win World Series\n\nJuan Soto is a very quick learner.
