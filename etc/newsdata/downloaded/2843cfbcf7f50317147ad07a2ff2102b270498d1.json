It\u2019s called a Diophantine Equation, and it\u2019s sometimes known as the \u201csumming of three cubes\u201d: Find x, y, and z such that x\u00b3+y\u00b3+z\u00b3=k, for each k from 1 to 100.\n\nOn the surface, it seems easy. Can you think of the integers for x, y, and z so that x\u00b3+y\u00b3+z\u00b3=8? Sure. One answer is x = 1, y = -1, and z = 2. But what about the integers for x, y, and z so that x\u00b3+y\u00b3+z\u00b3=42?\n\nThat turned out to be much harder\u2014as in, no one was able to solve for those integers for 65 years until a supercomputer finally came up with the solution to 42. (For the record: x = -80538738812075974, y = 80435758145817515, and z = 12602123297335631. Obviously.)\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of math: There\u2019s always an answer for everything, even if takes years, decades, or even centuries to find it. So here are nine more brutally difficult math problems that once seemed impossible until mathematicians found a breakthrough.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5uV54O2dPkNXivcC1fsYuQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_mechanics_642/ca052fecafdd8326cf0d1afcd16bae30", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
