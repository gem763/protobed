Lawmakers hurled allegations of betrayal and abuse of power across the chamber.\n\nThe anger had become so intense that the husband of a lawmaker murdered days before the 2016 EU membership referendum said it could encourage violence unless politicians toned down their rhetoric.\n\n\u201cWe do need to bring people together and get this thing done,\u201d Johnson told BBC TV, declining to apologise for his language. \u201cTempers need to calm down and people need to come together because it is only by getting Brexit done that you will actually lance the boil of the current anxiety.\u201d\n\nThe ferocity of the Brexit debate has shocked allies of a country that has prided itself on being a confident - and mostly tolerant - pillar of Western economic and political stability.\n\nHowever, three years since Britons voted to leave the European Union, the outcome remains mired in uncertainty with supporters on both sides of the debate becoming increasingly entrenched.\n\nUNLAWFUL\n\nJohnson returned to the House of Commons on Wednesday after the Supreme Court ruled that his decision to suspend parliament earlier this month was unlawful.\n\nHe challenged his opponents either to bring down the government or get out of the way to allow him to deliver Brexit, something he has vowed to do by Oct. 31 whether or not he has agreed a withdrawal deal with the European Union.\n\nHis opponents roared \u201cresign\u201d and some cast him as a cheating dictator who should stand aside after the court ruling.\n\nJohnson provoked anger by repeatedly calling a law that forces him to ask the EU for a three-month Brexit delay next month unless he can strike a deal as the \u201cSurrender Bill\u201d.\n\nHis critics say such language is often used in threats of violence or worse received by lawmakers, particularly women.\n\nA far-right extremist was jailed in May for planning to murder a female lawmaker with a sword, while on Thursday a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party said a man had been arrested at her office for striking the windows and shouting \u201cfascist\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister\u2019s language is encouraging people to behave in a disgraceful and abusive way towards other public figures,\u201d said Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader. \u201cI have witnessed it myself on the streets of this country.\u201d\n\nJohnson defended his use of \u201csurrender bill\u201d, arguing that the legislation hurt Britain\u2019s negotiating stance with the EU.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair enough to call the surrender act what it is,\u201d he told the BBC. He said the growing threat to lawmakers had to be addressed but declined to apologise for his words and disputed suggestions his language was stoking feelings.\n\n\u201cWhat I worry about is if we don\u2019t get Brexit done, then people will feel very badly let down,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that the toxic atmosphere meant opposition lawmakers might not support any Brexit deal he struck with the EU, making it almost impossible to get it through parliament, where he has no majority.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks at the parliament, which reconvenes after the UK Supreme Court ruled that his suspension of the parliament was unlawful, in London, Britain, September 25, 2019, in this screen grab taken from video. Parliament TV via REUTERS\n\nMany politicians were furious over his response on Wednesday to a question about Jo Cox, a 41-year-old Labour lawmaker and mother of two children who was murdered on June 16, 2016 by a loner obsessed with Nazis and extreme right-wing ideology.\n\nWhen one female Labour lawmaker said she had threats from people echoing the prime minister\u2019s rhetoric, Johnson replied: \u201cI have never heard so much humbug in my life\u201d\n\nCox\u2019s husband Brendan said both sides should ponder the impact of the words they used.\n\n\u201cTo descend into this bear pit of polarization is dangerous for our country,\u201d Cox told the BBC. \u201cIt creates an atmosphere where violence and attacks are more likely.\u201d\n\nPM\u2019S SISTER UNIMPRESSED\n\nJohnson says parliament is betraying the will of the people over Brexit, while opponents cast him a dictator who has ridden roughshod over democracy to take the United Kingdom to the brink of ruin.\n\nParliament speaker John Bercow said the atmosphere in the House of Commons was the worst he had known since he was elected 22 years ago.\n\nIt was not just politicians who were angry. Johnson\u2019s sister Rachel described her brother\u2019s words as a \u201cparticularly tasteless\u201d way to refer to the memory of a murdered lawmaker.\n\n\u201cWords like collaborationist, traitor, betrayal, my brother using words like surrender, capitulation, as if the people who are standing in the way of the blessed will of the people as defined by 17.4 million votes in 2016 should be hung, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered,\u201d she told Sky News.\n\n\u201cI think that it is highly reprehensible language to use.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nIn 2016, 17.4 million voters, or 52 percent, backed Brexit while 16.1 million, or 48 percent, voted to remain.\n\nFormer Conservative prime minister John Major, a vocal critic of Johnson, said he hoped many of his party\u2019s supporters would see the current government as an \u201caberration\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe abhor the language of division and hate \u2013 and words such as \u2018saboteur\u2019, \u2018traitor\u2019, \u2018enemy\u2019, \u2018surrender\u2019, \u2018betrayal\u2019 have no place in our party, our politics, nor in our society,\u201d he said.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday tempers needed to calm following a vitriolic session in parliament, after critics accused him of using language that had led to threats and abuse against his opponents.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434273128&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1XM", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
