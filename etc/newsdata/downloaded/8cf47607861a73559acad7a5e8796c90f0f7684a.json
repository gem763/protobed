These had been the subject of a Competition and Markets Authority investigation, but it was closed in 2015 when the EU imposed a cap of 0.2 per cent per transaction by debit card and 0.3 per cent by credit card.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Interchange fees are only one part of the equation.\n\nThere is also what\u2019s known as an acquirer fee, which goes to the retailer\u2019s bank for processing each transaction. And there are scheme fees charged by Visa, MasterCard or American Express.\n\nIn Britain the first two account for upwards of 98 per cent of the market.\n\nAccording to the BRC, card fees increased by \u00a370m last year, with most of the increase accounted for by rising scheme fees.\n\nIt would like the rules, and in particular the cap, to be extended, and simplified so that there are less carve-outs. An example of one of those would be corporate cards, that might be issued to you by your employer, are not covered by the interchange fee cap.\n\nIts point is well made. Card/payment companies are huge businesses with pricing power, little apparent incentive to compete with each other, and every incentive to increase their fees. A retailer that refuses to take payments from one of them because of the what they charge is effectively shooting itself in the foot. They have little choice but to take it on the chin.\n\nThe EU is currently reviewing the rules, so there\u2019s a chance that things could change for the better.\n\nYou\u2019ll regularly hear people banging on about regulation and red tape imposed by the fabled Brussels bureaucrats. But sometimes that red tape and those bureaucrats are a force for good. This could be an example.\n\nOf course, if the UK does Brexit it won\u2019t be included. In the absence of action on the part of its regulators, payment companies will be free to gouge away to their hearts\u2019 content.\n\nGiven the state of preparedness for Brexit, you\u2019d imagine that that is what will happen. Unless Britain\u2019s regulators are prepared to burn a lot of midnight oil, consumers, and businesses, are going to lose out.\n\nHere\u2019s a scary thought: this is just one example of an issue thrown up by Brexit, one irksome detail among many that the British government seems entirely unconcerned about.\n\nIts ministers really are the high priests of negligence.", "description": "One of the consequences of Brexit is that lots of important and necessary work done by the EU\u2019s watchdogs is going to end up getting dumped on those in the UK.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take the example of payments, and the evidence that the dash towards plastic is contributing to retailers, and thus their customers, getting gouged.\u00a0 Last year, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) says that the", "authors": ["James Moore"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/05/27/17/cards.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
