Even an anodyne softball game between Sanders\u2019s staff and members of the press became a source of (minor) controversy.\n\nSanders quickly walked back his criticism of the Post. \u201cDo I think Jeff Bezos is on the phone, telling the editor of The Washington Post what to do? Absolutely not. It doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Sanders told CNN. \u201cWhat I think is in the media in general there\u2019s a framework\u2026. For example, I\u2019ve been in politics for a few years. You know what? Not one reporter has ever asked me \u2018Bernie, what are you going to do about the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nThough not perfectly articulated, Sanders had a point. By attrition and consolidation, the media is dominated by a handful of large, corporate institutions\u2014as a result, the priorities of what is and isn\u2019t covered are often skewed.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Sanders wrote an op-ed in the Columbia Journalism Review that both expands on that media critique and provides a compelling vision of a better future\u2014for the press and for everyone else. It is, like much of the senator\u2019s best work, an amalgam of concerns: the role of corporations and financial institutions in everyday life, growing income inequality and corporate consolidation, and the state of democracy. The plan is, to a large extent, an antitrust plan disguised as a media policy\u2014though, if enacted, it would do a great deal to reverse the technology- and hedge-fund-induced ravages of the past decade.\n\n", "description": "The 2020 presidential candidate hopes less consolidation, stronger unions, and better regulation will mean more \"real journalism\" and less clickbait.", "authors": ["Alex Shephard"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/2709d48eebce3deecc6235406f2497b4aff700ac.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
