As long as I\u2019m providing for them, nothing else matters. Everything I do is for them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKatie appeared on the Victoria Derbyshire show earlier this month, where she also discussed the support she\u2019s received, saying: \u2018I am overwhelmed by it, I didn\u2019t realise. I\u2019m not on Twitter so didn\u2019t see any of it. It\u2019s kept me away from the bad stuff but to hear that was amazing \u2013 I am so glad to have their support.\u2019\n\nKatie played Hayley Slater in EastEnders last year, and featured in a number of storylines \u2014 her biggest undoubtedly being the secret fling she\u2019d had off-screen with Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), which led to a showdown with Kat (Jessie Wallace) on Christmas day. The character made her final appearance in February this year.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Katie was job-shamed earlier this month, and she received a tonne of support from fellow actors as a result.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/16613228-low_res-eastenders-october-december-2018-06db_1572360721.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
