The Dow DJIA, -1.74% most recently was down 300 points, or 1.1%, at 26,270, trading below its 50-day moving average at 26,540.29, according to FactSet data. The index hasn't finished below its short-term average since Sept. 4. A breach of that level, viewed by technical analysts as a demarcation line between bullish and bearish trends, could add pressure to stock selling, with such technical moves tending to trigger sell signals among computer and algorithmic traders. A private-sector employment report released early Wednesday from Automatic Data Processing ADP, -2.07% showed that a modest 135,000 jobs were created in September, another sign that hiring is slowing along with the broader U.S. economy. That missed the Econoday consensus forecast of 152,000 jobs. On top of that, the average monthly job growth for the past three months also fell to 145,000 from 214,000 for the same time period last year. The weak employment reading comes ahead of the more closely followed non-farm payrolls report due on Friday and after the weakest reading of manufacturing activity from the Institute of Supply Management in about a decade. The broader market also was under selling pressure, with the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.68% down 1.1% at 2,907, after finishing below its own 50-day moving average on Tuesday. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.58% was down 1.1% at 7,822, while the small-capitalization Russell 2000 index RUT, -1.03% was trading 1.4% lower at 1,472.", "description": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday was shedding more than 1%, adding to an ugly start to October, and pushing the blue-chip gauge below a closely...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"}
