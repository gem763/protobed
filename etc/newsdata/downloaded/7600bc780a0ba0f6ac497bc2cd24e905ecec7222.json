On a quick look, certain numbers don't add up. I've never seen this kind of discrepancy before.\n\nExample:\n\n+53,461,366 = Change in Net Assets from Operations\n\n-0.36 = Per share Change in Net Assets from Operations\n\nThe report only gives a share count for end of period, yet the per share table of data uses average share count in the period; these two figures will be very different given the increase in the share count from the rights offering. Regardless, the directionality of the amount should not change.\n\nAnother issue: the Financial Highlights page shows \"--\" shares issued in the first half of 2019, which is wrong as of course there was a significant increase in shares from the rights offering.\n\nThe fund's performance cannot be assessed simply be looking at the NAV change as a large number of shares were issued below NAV in the period. My guess is that the raw figures are more likely to be correct than the per share amounts on the Highlights table, but we'll see if a correction is issued.\n\nI don't have time right now to look at the changes, if any, with Jernigan and TerreStar; they're still there, and TerreStar valuation is a little bit higher.", "description": "NHF's semi dropped today.
