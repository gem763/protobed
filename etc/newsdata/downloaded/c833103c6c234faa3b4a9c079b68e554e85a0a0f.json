Free stuff is sometimes given away before closing\n\nSome of you might have been on the receiving end of this one.\n\nAs a store nears closing time, staff are sometimes asked to gather up a few of the more perishable goods and dash around offering them to customers.\n\nIt can be anything from flowers to whole loaves of bread, so it's definitely worth hanging around for.\n\nMaybe head to your nearest Waitrose 10 minutes before closing and give it a try. At the very least you might get some heavily discounted items at that time.\n\n2. 'It's on Us' stickers\n\nAgain, something that a few customers may have experienced before.\n\nWaitrose staff are often armed with a roll of 'It's on Us' stickers, designed to be given out (with discretion) to shoppers in certain scenarios.\n\nFor example, should you want to buy a specific product that happens to not be in stock, causing a bit of annoyance, staff may find a similar alternative and sanction a freebie on that replacement item.\n\n3. The staff discount is really good\n\nOnce you've worked at Waitrose for more than three months, you're given a 15% discount to use in store, which can be a serious game changer.\n\nYou get a spare for a family member, too. That can be used as a ready-made bargaining tool around Christmas time.\n\nThat discount also applied in part to John Lewis when I worked there\n\n4. Everything always needs to be spotlessly clean\n\nIt should be no secret that supermarkets aim to maintain a high standard of cleanliness throughout a store.\n\nBut at Waitrose it's often above and beyond ticking off the requirements on a sheet.\n\nEspecially with so many different counters, aisles and often a caf\u00e9, you'll always be able to spot at least one member of staff doing in a tidy up.\n\nParticular favourite activities for staff include a frantic wipe of your checkout conveyor belt while you've got a spare two minutes.\n\n5. Staff get shop food on the cheap in the staff room\n\nAdmit it, we've all been into Waitrose and been a bit puzzled at having just paid \u00a32.50 for a ham and cheese sandwich.\n\nNot to make you feel even worse, but all employees have to do to solve it for themselves is walk upstairs to the staff room.\n\nUp there are the exact same products you'd see on the shelves, but for a fraction of the price.\n\nWant cheap quality sandwiches? Get a job at Waitrose.\n\n6. Some have secret security staff\n\nWe won't say too much about this one, for obvious reasons.\n\nBut some Waitrose stores have employed security guards that are paid to blend in with shoppers and keep an eye on the store.\n\nObviously, a lot of stores now do employ visible security staff at entrances and exits.\n\n7. The overnight team\n\nEver wondered just how your favourite products get magically restocked?\n\nYou've got the overnight team to thank for that.\n\nIt's a seamless changeover as the daytime team closes up the supermarket and heads home to be replaced by the speedy team of nighttime stackers and unpackers.\n\nOften, they'll get to wear their own, comfier clothes and can get their work done while listening to their headphones on the shop floor.\n\nThey'll ensure that everything is replenished and organised ready for the next day's opening.\n\n8. Sneaky staff entrances\n\nSecret, side doors reserved for staff only can give us a way to slip in and out of the building without being asked something while we're off-shift.\n\nFor the most part, they're used so that employees can get into the store for shifts outside of main opening hours, but some also lead to staff-only smoking areas if needed.", "description": "From freebies to mystery stickers, an ex-employees tells all on the supermarket chain", "authors": ["Alex Boyd", "Grace Witherden"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20567561.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_121019Slug_10767JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
