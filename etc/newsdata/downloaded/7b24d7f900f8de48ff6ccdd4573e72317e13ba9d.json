(AP) - With Tua Tagovailoa hurt, No. 1 Alabama turned to the defense and Najee Harris to pull out a 35-13 victory over Tennessee Saturday night.\n\nThe Crimson Tide (7-0, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) faced its first test of the season without last season\u2019s Heisman Trophy runner-up against the five-touchdown underdogs. Both starting quarterbacks left the game before halftime, and the Volunteers (2-5, 1-3) put up a fight much of the way.\n\nTagovailoa, the leader of a normally high-powered offense, left with an ankle injury in the second quarter and didn\u2019t return to the field. Tennessee freshman Brian Maurer had also exited with an unspecified injury, replaced by former starter Jarrett Guarantano.\n\nThe end result was familiar: Alabama\u2019s 13th consecutive win over the rival Vols.\n\nTrevon Diggs recovered Guarantano\u2019s fumble on fourth-and-goal from the 1 and raced 100 yards for a touchdown to end the threat. Tennessee could have cut the deficit to a touchdown, down 28-13.\n\nVols coach Jeremy Pruitt had some angry words for Guarantano as the quarterback walked toward the sideline, pointing his finger toward him and briefly grabbing at his facemask.\n\nHarris was already delivering before Tagovailoa\u2019s injury. He wound up running for 105 yards and two touchdowns and adding 48 yards on four catches. It was the second straight 100-yard game for a playmaker often overshadowed by Tagovailoa and the passing game.\n\nAlabama got a cushion when reserve wide receiver Slade Bolden threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Miller Forristall in the end zone with 4:55 in the third. Bolden did a celebratory dance toward the sideline, where he was swarmed by teammates.\n\nIt was a needed pick-me-up with the Vols riding momentum and having cut it to 21-13 with a field goal. The defense then made a stop with Terrell Lewis sacking Guarantano on third down.\n\nTagovailoa finished 11-of-12 passing for 155 yards but also threw an interception on first-and-goal from the 2 when he scrambled around and forced the ball. Backup Mac Jones passed for 72 yards.\n\nTAKEAWAY\n\nTennessee: Came closer to the Tide than any other opponent this season. Had 13 penalties for 93 yards. Guarantano was 7 of 16 for 55 yards. Maurer was 5 of 7 for 62 yards with an interception.\n\nAlabama: Survived a rare bad decision by Tagovailoa and his injury. A young defense delivered when it had to. Alabama also was heavily penalized, flagged eight times for 93 yards.\n\nTARGETING\n\nTennessee middle linebacker Daniel Bituli was ejected for targeting in the second quarter for a hit on receiver Jerry Jeudy near the goal line. The Vols were without linebacker Henry To\u2019o To\u2019o for the first half for a targeting infraction against Mississippi State.\n\nICING THE KICKER\n\nWhen Alabama\u2019s Joseph Bulovas lined up for a 41-yard field goal attempt late in the first half, Tennessee called time out. Then another one, and finally a third while Tide fans booed. The strategy may have worked because Bulovas\u2019 kick went wide left.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTennessee hosts South Carolina, which lost 38-27 to No. 9 Florida.\n\nAlabama hosts Arkansas, coming off a 51-10 loss to No. 11 Auburn.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With Tua Tagovailoa hurt, No. 1 Alabama turned to the defense and Najee Harris to pull out a 35-13 victory over Tennessee Saturday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Zenor"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/tennessee_alabama_football_88031_c0-163-3913-2445_s1200x700.jpg?e703903cf0c2944ffcca9a2eb455da437271c9ed", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
