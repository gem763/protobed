He might seek a general election for a third time, but knows the move would be shot down by opposition parties until he has swallowed the horrible medicine of an extension and until they are sure he cannot wriggle out of it.\n\nHe might prorogue parliament again for a few days before the Queen\u2019s Speech planned for 14 October. (The Supreme Court said a four-to-six day break before the state opening was normal). But, with MPs now back at Westminster and the wind in their sails, the Queen\u2019s Speech would probably be voted down. Johnson is now in danger of being held prisoner by parliament, unable to break out.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nThe least worst option for getting out of this mess of his own making \u2013 and perhaps the only way for him to avoid a humiliating U-turn on an extension \u2013 is to secure a new Brexit deal. The approval of the Benn Act forced the PM to seek such an extension and certainly saw the government inject more energy into getting a deal. The Supreme Court\u2019s dramatic intervention now ratchets up the pressure further.\n\nBoris claimed during his curtailed visit to New York that a \u201cgreat deal of progress has been made\u201d in the talks. But yet again, he is being rather economical with the truth. Brussels tells a very different story. \u201cWe are a very long way apart,\u201d one insider told me. \u201cThere has been no real progress.\u201d\n\nTalks continue at a technical level about the Irish backstop. But EU officials are at the table mainly because they do not want to be seen to be walking away or spurning UK advances. The EU\u2019s national leaders want to show their domestic audience they tried to prevent no deal in case that happens; they know it would be accompanied by a cry of \u201cblame Brussels\u201d from Johnson.\n\nEU officials dismiss tentative proposals floated by the UK as not even coming close to satisfying the EU\u2019s three demands for any alternative to the backstop \u2013 a fully open border; maintaining Northern Ireland-Ireland cooperation under the Good Friday Agreement and preserving the EU\u2019s single market.\n\nFor example, UK plans for an all-island, agri-food zone would cover only about 35 per cent of border issues, according to Brussels. It argues that UK plans for an almost invisible border do not meet EU demands for \u201cno infrastructure, related checks and controls\u201d. Proposed exemptions for small businesses are a problem for the EU because almost half of cross-border trade by value is by such firms.\n\n\u201cPiecemeal measures will not be enough to close the gulf between us,\u201d one source said.\n\nEU diplomats believe the only way an agreement could be struck at the EU leaders\u2019 crucial summit on 17-18 October would be for Johnson to concede some \u201cNorthern Ireland-only\u201d solutions. They see no chance of that happening until after next week\u2019s Tory conference because the issue is so sensitive. Even then, it would risk alienating the Tories\u2019 Democratic Unionist Party partners.\n\nAnd there would still be no guarantee of a deal. After seeing Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement rejected three times by MPs, the EU would be reluctant to make concessions unless they believed they would win Commons approval. Any such confidence will not be enhanced by what looks from Brussels like a government weakened by the Supreme Court ruling, and heading for an extension followed by an election.\n\nThat\u2019s another reason for the EU to hold back, and wait to see what the voters decide.\n\nThe Benn Act kicks in on the day after the summit if no agreement has been approved by parliament. If Boris defied it, he would soon be back in court. One senior legal source predicted: \u201cThings would move quickly. The courts could issue a notice to comply with the law and the government might have only an hour to respond.\u201d\n\nIf Johnson really wants a deal, he is going to have to give ground in the negotiations, and quickly.", "description": "Before Tuesday\u2019s devastating Supreme Court ruling, some Boris Johnson allies saw the case as a mere hors d\u2019oeuvre before the real legal battle next month.
