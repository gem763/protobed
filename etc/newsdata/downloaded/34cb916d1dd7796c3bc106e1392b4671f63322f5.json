After the Fox analyst claimed the media was \u201clazy,\u201d suffer from a \u201cliberal bias,\u201d and \u201cshoot from the hip,\u201d Cavuto wondered aloud if Jarrett could say anything negative about the president\u2019s behavior and tendency to lie and misspeak.\n\n\u201cBut do you say that the president does not sometimes confuse people?\u201d Cavuto asked. \u201cHe says something and then says something else?\u201d\n\nJarrett tried to deflect, complaining about reporters accepting \u201cintelligence leaks,\u201d prompting Cavuto to press again.\n\n\u201cI get that, and you well-researched that and documented with great detail, and it is impressive,\u201d the Fox anchor noted. \u201cBut do you fault the president for anything?\u201d\n\nPausing for a moment, Jarrett responded that the one thing he can fault Trump for was hiring Jeff Sessions as his attorney general, something he added Trump himself has said he was wrong to do.\n\nCavuto, who is one of the rare Trump-skeptic voices on Fox, further confronted his colleague on Trump\u2019s lies and flip-flops on payments he made to women he had alleged affairs with, causing Jarrett to shrug that off. The host then moved on to Trump attempting to get a foreign leader to dig up dirt on a political opponent.\n\n\u201cWith the Ukraine situation, when you look at that\u2014now you are the lawyer, I don\u2019t know what is considered a high crime or misdemeanor, might not fit the case here\u2014is it proper for a sitting president of the United States to talk to a foreign leader about involving himself in a campaign?\u201d Cavuto asked.\n\nThe pro-Trump Fox personality, however, took the opportunity to make an argument he\u2019s made in the past\u2014that it would actually be a crime if the president did not ask Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his family. (There is no evidence Biden or his son did anything illegal or wrong in Ukraine.)\n\nAfter a bit more back and forth, Cavuto eventually tried to get Jarrett to admit at least one thing: Doesn\u2019t it \u201clook bad\u201d that Trump pressed Ukraine to investigate Biden?\n\n\u201cIt looks bad to Democrats,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cIt does not look bad to me.\u201d\n\nThis gentle but telling confrontation comes on the heels of a network civil war between the Fox news division and opinion hosts and commentators, which recently spilled out on air. Earlier this month, amid these clashes, longtime anchor Shepard Smith announced he was departing Fox News after 23 years.", "description": "\u201cI get that, and you well-researched that and documented with great detail, and it is impressive,\u201d the Fox anchor noted. \u201cBut do you fault the president for anything?\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571261964/your-world-neil-cavuto_12_k0hrb0", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
