And appearing on the Happy Sad Confused podcast with Josh Horowitz, the 45-year-old came agonisingly close to spilling some Star Wars infused tea.\n\n\u2018There is a very real possibility [I\u2019ll be appearing],\u2019 Edgerton revealed, before making sure he didn\u2019t say anything else to give the game away. \u2018There\u2019s potentially an assassin on a rooftop just outside the window if I say the wrong thing. I\u2019d love to say all sorts of things. I\u2019m just not going to.\u2019\n\nThankfully, McGregor has been a little more forthcoming and made a surprise appearance at the Disney D23 Expo back in August where he was introduced by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy.\n\nJoel Edgerton remained suspiciously coy over the Star Wars prequel (Picture: REUTERS)\n\nShe began: \u2018Before leaving, we do have one more announcement.\n\n\u2018After secrets, and fibs, and not being able to talk about it, I am thrilled to bring out a beloved member of the Star Wars family.\u2019\n\nMcGregor then charged on stage and turned to the exec. \u2018Kathleen, can you ask me in front of all of these people, all of these witnesses, can you please ask me, am I going to play Obi-Wan Kenobi again?\u2019\n\nI\u2019m coming back! Ewan tells the D23 expo. (Picture: Getty)\n\nShe grinned: \u2018Ewan, are you going to play Obi-Wan Kenobi again?\u2019\n\nThe Scottish star then looked out into the audience and confirmed: \u2018Yes.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Obi Wan Kenobi prequel is expected to arrive on Disney in either 2020 or 2021.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
