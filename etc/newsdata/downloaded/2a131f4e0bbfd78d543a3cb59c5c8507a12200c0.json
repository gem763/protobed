But in scenes reminiscent of New Zealand\u2019s \u201closs\u201d in the World Cup final, Isa advanced on countback.\n\nDevastated is not a strong enough word to describe how my squad felt after that loss, but BBL09 is a new season and I predict my lads will use last year\u2019s disappointment as motivation to claim a maiden title.\n\nAnd if not, I\u2019ll certainly win the commentary box banter.\n\nHere\u2019s my side for 2019-20:\n\nBATSMEN\n\nD\u2019Arcy Short $262,800\n\nInternational standard player who can\u2019t quite force into the national T20 side ahead of David Warner and Aaron Finch. Has the talent to one day play all-formats for Australia and his left arm wrist spin is extremely underrated.\n\nChris Lynn $173,000\n\nUltimate power at the top of the order and a superstar in this format. Has a double game in Round 1 so he\u2019s a huge chance of being my skipper.\n\nAaron Finch $167,000\n\nWorld class. Gets the job done almost every time and starts quite cheap after last year\u2019s rough patch.\n\nMackenzie Harvey $71,900\n\nComing off a solid debut season opening the batting for the Renegades and could really bust out in his second year.\n\nMORE SUPERCOACH:\n\nCheapie Bible\n\nL-plate guide\n\nSuperCoach back bigger, better\n\nCaleb Jewell $67,300\n\nImpressive so far in the Marsh Cup and is set to be promoted to open for the Hurricanes alongside Darcy Short, with Matthew Wade on Test duty.\n\nMatthew Gilkes $96,700\n\nUpstaged David Warner and Steve Smith in a recent Marsh Cup game. The fact the rookie keeper-batsman made the team sheet in the first place shows how highly-rated he is given NSW fielded a near Test-strength team.\n\nOllie Davis $42,000\n\nOne of the most exciting young hitters in the country. Smashed 17 sixes in an innings at last season\u2019s Australian Under 19 championships.\n\nUnder 19's star hits six 6's Cricket: NSW Metro Captain Ollie Davies has belted six sixes in one over during his double century in the under-19 national championships.\n\nWICKET KEEPERS\n\nJosh Philippe $123,000\n\nWill be in Australian colours by the end of the summer.\n\nHarry Nielsen $75,400\n\nThe son of my former Australian coach Tim Nielsen has the pedigree to go a long way. Brilliant 79 off 49 balls to lead the Prime Minister\u2019s XI to victory over Sri Lanka last week.\n\nBOWLERS\n\nMarcus Stoinis $278,900\n\nI\u2019ve been a big fan for a long time. He\u2019ll be hurting after falling out of favour with national selectors and will look to make a statement in the Big Bash.\n\nGlenn Maxwell $175,100\n\nHe was my first player picked in The Hundred draft as coach of London Spirit. Proven matchwinner who is impossible to bowl to when he\u2019s on.\n\nRiley Meredith $139,000\n\nBest young quick in the country. Expect him to break into Australian white ball teams this summer and it won\u2019t be long before he plays all three formats.\n\nFawad Ahmed $113,000\n\nUnderrated. Could easily play for Australia if Nathan Lyon went down. Switches from the Thunder to the Scorchers this year and the extra bounce at Optus Stadium will suit his style.\n\nMitchell Swepson $98,500\n\nTalented spinner, but unfortunately he isn\u2019t used well in Queensland. Should be playing more cricket, but this could be the year he finally breaks out.\n\nWill Sutherland $42,000\n\nHe was one of my rookie picks last year before going down with stress fractures. Bowls quick and hits long \u2014 one of the best young all-rounders in the country\n\nCameron Green $42,000\n\nSpeaking of young all-rounders, this 20-year-old is making a huge impression at Shield level. Stands over 200cm, bowls 140km/h, hits massive bombs and starts at base price. Yes please.\n\nMORE SUPERCOACH BBL CONTENT\n\nStar-studded squad lists / Top 10 young guns / Everything you need to know / Key dates to shape your season / Gun imports set to explode / New faces to target / How players earn points", "description": "SuperCoach BBL is back for 2019-20 which means the \u201cClub 23 Legends\u201d return for a shot at redemption after an outrageously unlucky debut season.", "authors": ["Shane Warne"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/fae73119cc6675e6eb5669fac776fccb?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
