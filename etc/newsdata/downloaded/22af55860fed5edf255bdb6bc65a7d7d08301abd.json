The instant lending platform claims that they now offer the lowest rates in the ecosystem.\n\nNexo\u2019s crypto credit lines reportedly start at 5.9% with no minimum repayment requirements and no credit checks and are available across more than 200 jurisdictions.\n\nNexo allows digital asset holders to borrow against a basket of an array of digital currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC) and others, without losing ownership of their assets.\n\nThe lending platform reported in August that it had paid its token holders a total of $2,409,574.87 in dividends, reaching an annualized dividend yield of 12.73%. With a user base of over 250,000, Nexo\u2019s dividend yield is purportedly higher than every dividend-paying stock listed on the S&P 500 market index.\n\nDuring the same month, Nexo launched a Mastercard-branded cryptocurrency credit card, which they claimed to be the first card in the world that enables users to spend the value of their cryptocurrency without in fact spending it.\n\nNexo\u2019s competition\n\nCointelegraph previously reported that Nexo\u2019s competitor, cryptocurrency lending and borrowing platform Celsius Network, topped $300 million in deposits in just 12 months and completed over $2 billion in coin loan origination. In total, Celsius completed over 160,000 coin loan trades and distributed over $3 million in interest payments. Celsius claimed that it had become the fastest-growing lending platform in the world.", "description": "Platform for instant crypto loans lowers borrowing rates on its credit line service after having secured long-term cost-efficient financing", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8yN2U2ZDM3NGQ1NDYzNGI3NzkxM2Y2YjNlYzZmNWVlYy5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
