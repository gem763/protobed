Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2019\n\nWhile a deeply Republican state that voted for Trump by 20 points in 2016 would appear to be fertile ground for a GOP victory, worries within the party have arisen that a bitter and personal campaign between Abraham and Rispone could cost the party a golden opportunity to win the gubernatorial race.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRispone hammered Abraham in an attack ad last month, and Abraham fired back with a video calling his opponent \u201cdesperate\u201d and telling voters, \u201cEddie Rispone is lying to you.\u201d\n\nThe two candidates also bickered at a debate this week over education policy and Abraham\u2019s promise to donate his congressional salary to charity.\n\nBel Edwards was elected to his first term in the state in 2015. No Democratic governor has won two consecutive terms in Louisiana since the mid 1970s, but The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan election handicapper, rates the race as leaning Democratic.\n\nThe president brought both candidates on stage during his rally Friday night but cautioned \u201cyou\u2019re not allowed to hit your Republican opponent, you\u2019re only allowed to hit John Bel Edwards, because he deserves it.\u201d\n\nThe president urged Republicans to head to the polls before Saturday night's game between the Florida Gators and LSU Tigers, saying, \"Go out and vote and then enjoy the game as it should be enjoyed.\"\n\nTrump has in recent days emerged as a chief cheerleader for the two Republican gubernatorial candidates, saying either Abraham or Rispone would be a good alternative to Edwards.\n\n\u201cREPUBLICANS of Louisiana, it is really important for you to go out and vote on October 12th for either Eddie Rispone or Ralph Abraham (both Great), which will lead to a runoff against a Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiTrump lashes out at 2020 Dems, impeachment inquiry In marathon testimony, Dems see an ambassador scorned, while GOP defends Trump Trump accuses Pelosi of 'hating' US over impeachment inquiry MORE/Chuck Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerTrump urges Louisiana voters to back GOP in governor's race then 'enjoy the game' Federal judge declares Trump border proclamation unlawful Senate Dems aim to overturn Trump administration rollback of power plant regs MORE Democrat (John Bel Edwards), who does nothing but stymie all of the things we are doing to Make America Great Again,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled, John Bel Edwards will NEVER be for us.\u201d\n\n....a Nancy Pelosi/Chuck Schumer Democrat (John Bel Edwards), who does nothing but stymie all of the things we are doing to Make America Great Again.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019\n\nDespite the president\u2019s broadsides against Edwards, the Democrat has worked to burnish his centrist bona fides in the race. He has repeatedly highlighted his pro-Second Amendment and anti-abortion stances over his decision to expand Medicaid and boost public education funding while also declining to hit back at Trump.\n\n\u201cI intend to maintain good working relationship with president in my second term,\u201d Edwards said at a press conference Friday ahead of Trump\u2019s rally.\n\nEdwards won his first term in 2015 over a scandal-plagued Republican who had been tied to a Washington, D.C. woman who was convicted of running a prostitution service.\n\nThis cycle, Edwards has hammered his opponents as either irresponsible or tied to past, failed policies. He's repeatedly panned Abraham for shirking his duties in Washington to campaign for governor and attacked Rispone for his donations to former Gov. Bobby Jindal (R), under whose tenure the state deficit skyrocketed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got one opponent who ignores the job he has and the promises that he made to get it,\u201d Edwards said at this week\u2019s debate. \u201cI\u2019ve got another opponent who was biggest supporter of the failed policies of Bobby Jindal that ran our state dip in the ditch.\u201d\n\nEdwards\u2019s strategy appears to be working, with polling showing him running well ahead of both Abrahams and Rispone, leaving him in a strong position even if he fails to breach the 50 percent threshold before polls close at 8 p.m. local time Saturday.", "description": "Louisiana voters are heading to the polls Saturday in one of the nation\u2019s more competitive gubernatorial races as the GOP sets its sights on flipping the governor\u2019s seat in the ruby red state.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/beledwardsjohn_101219getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
