Good one! \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 22, 2019\n\nDo these intellectual lightweights have a bigger tell that Trump\u2019s got a serious problem then when they try to do the LOL WE\u2019RE TROLLING bit? It\u2019s so transparent and boring. https://t.co/RGf3r9lAFN \u2014 Susan Hennessey (@Susan_Hennessey) September 22, 2019\n\nI recognize Hemingway is bottom of the barrel, but even Trumpist significantly smarter than her resort to it. You do you, I guess. Just seems ineffective and lazy. \u2014 Susan Hennessey (@Susan_Hennessey) September 22, 2019\n\nFirst up, it\u2019s \u201cthan\u201d not \u201cthen\u201d:\n\nHello, intellectual superior.

Time:\n\nAnytime someone calls another person an intellectual lightweight, it\u2019s an obvious projection. Must be a sad life to be such a person. https://t.co/yu2PiZ5P0K \u2014 Matthew (@matthops82) September 22, 2019\n\nBut more importantly, why\u2019d she get so nasty?\n\nPersonal insults don't suit you or your arguments, Susan. Again, I was laughing at your characterization of Adam Schiff as measured, since he's so obviously not. He claimed he had evidence of Trump's treasonous collusion with Russia, for example, when he definitively did not. \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 22, 2019\n\n***\n\nRelated:\n\nTrump \u2013 Ukraine \u2018scandal\u2019 is at Watergate proportions according to media analyst Brian Stelter \u2014 who does not analyze CNN\u2019s coverage, it seems https://t.co/28w93JVCZR \u2014 Twitchy Team (@TwitchyTeam) September 22, 2019\n\n\u2018You corrupt LOSERS\u2019: Nick Searcy isn\u2019t having ANY of David Axelrod\u2019s lame attempt to cover for Biden\u2019s Ukraine \u2018problem\u2019 https://t.co/IEjdGfXakg \u2014 Twitchy Team (@TwitchyTeam) September 22, 2019", "description": "\"Hello, intellectual superior.\"", "authors": ["Greg P.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cnn_gif.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
