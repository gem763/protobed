People who retire earlier would have to accept a lower pension: five percent less for someone who stops working at 63, for example.\n\nDelevoye has also suggested cancelling the more advantageous pensions enjoyed by some professions, including public transport and utilities workers, sailors, notaries and even Paris Opera workers.\n\nThe government has vowed to hold consultations with labour representatives while the bill is debated in parliament, with a vote expected next year.\n\n\u2013 Not well received \u2013\n\nAn opinion poll published Thursday said 43 percent of French people oppose the reform.\n\nThe country has seen two massive public transport strikes in recent weeks by tram and train workers opposed to changes they say will force them to work for longer.\n\nAnother transport strike is planned from December 5.\n\nThere have also been protests by lawyers, nurses, doctors and airline pilots.\n\nOn Wednesday, thousands of police took to the streets of Paris, with pension reform among their gripes.\n\nThe labour action adds to the pressure already brought to bear by \u201cyellow vests\u201d protesting around France every Sunday for most of the past year.\n\nLast week, the government unveiled a draft 2020 budget with tax cuts of 9.3 billon euros ($10 billion) for households in response to the uprising, making it unlikely Macron will honour his pledge of balancing the government\u2019s books by 2022.\n\nRight-wing president Nicolas Sarkozy raised France\u2019s retirement age from 60 to 62 in 2010 despite months of protests that brought millions onto the streets.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 French President Emmanuel Macron sought to ease fears over his controversial pension reform Thursday in a debate with concerned", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/04/dd8eea_macron-reassurances-his-pension-plans-macron-seeks-placate-french-pension-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
