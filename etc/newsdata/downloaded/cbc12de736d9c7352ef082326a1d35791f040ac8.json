Pixabay\n\nWelcomed a new bundle of joy this year and already thinking of travelling? Congratulations, your baby is now eligible to apply for a passport for free.\n\nSingapore\u2019s Immigration & Checkpoints Authority said on Tuesday (Oct 15) that it had revised the eligibility criteria of a passport fee waiver announced as part of the marriage and parenthood package in August, so that parents of babies born in 2019 can be included.\n\nThe initial announcement had limited the S$70 application fee waiver to babies born on or after January 1, 2020.\n\nICA said the implementation was \u201cmeant to be a small token to celebrate the birth of a new citizen\u201d, adding that the criteria had been adjusted \u201cin view of appeals\u201d.\n\nThe fee waiver will now be applied to applications submitted from January 1 next year, as long as it is submitted on or before the child\u2019s first birthday. Only online applications submitted through the ICA website are eligible for the fee waiver.\n\nThis means that babies born on January 1 this year will also be eligible for the fee waiver, as long as parents wait until New Year\u2019s Day next year to submit the first passport application.\n\nParents who collect their child\u2019s birth certificate from the hospital or at the ICA Building from Tuesday will be notified of the revised eligibility criteria, ICA said.\n\nFrom next year, parents of newborns will receive an electronic notification via MyICA about the waiver on their personal dashboards. They can then click on that notification to directly start the passport application.\n\nParents who log on directly to ICA\u2019s passport e-Service to apply for their child\u2019s first passport will also receive an electronic notification about the waiver upon entering their child\u2019s birth certificate number, if their child is eligible.\n\nFrom next year, ICA will also not require children below the age of six to be present for passport collection. Parents can collect their child\u2019s passport at the ICA Building once they have been notified to make an appointment.\n\nChildren aged six and above must be present for collection as their biometric identifiers \u2013 such as fingerprints and iris images \u2013 need to be enrolled at the point of collection. This will allow them to use the automated lanes for immigration clearance at the checkpoints.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Good news for parents with babies born in 2019!.
