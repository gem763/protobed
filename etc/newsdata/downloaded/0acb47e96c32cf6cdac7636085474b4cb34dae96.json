After featuring 19 franchises at its peak, the league was forced to declare bankruptcy and cancel its 2009 season. A reorganized version of the AFL resurfaced in 2010 and experienced early success, only to contract several franchises and suspend operations for a second time.\n\nThe National Union Fire Insurance Company sued in the AFL in New York Supreme Court earlier this month, alleging the league failed to pay premiums related to workers' compensation for its players from 2009 and 2012. The lawsuit claims the league owes more than $2.4 million in back payments.\n\nThe AFL has yet to determine whether it will permanently cease operations and plans to explore potential restructuring options. AFL executives will determine whether the league will continue \u201cwithin the next few weeks\u201d and will issue refunds as needed if it folds.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cWe are exploring every possible avenue to continue bringing AFL football to our fans, including further evolutions to the current business model, and are engaging with prospective investors and supporters who are interested in seeing the League continue to grow,\u201d Boe added.\n\nAt present, the AFL has six franchises \u2013 the Albany Empire, the Atlantic City Blackjacks, the Baltimore Brigade, the Columbus Destroyers, the Philadelphia Soul and the Washington Valor.\n\nThe AFL\u2019s shutdown occurred just months after the Alliance of American Football, another upstart football league, folded midway through its inaugural season due to financial issues. A third league, a rebooted version of the XFL backed by WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, recently held its player draft and will kick off in February.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "The AFL has experienced several financial highs and lows since it was founded in 1987.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Arena-Football-League-GettyImages-1483270.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
