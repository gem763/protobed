REUTERS/Nigel Marple/File Photo\n\nEmployees at the world\u2019s biggest dairy exporter earning over NZ$100,000 ($64,000) a year will not receive a pay rise this year, according to the email sent on Tuesday by Chief Executive Miles Hurrell.\n\n\u201cThis has been a tough call, but it\u2019s also the right one,\u201d Hurrell wrote.\n\nAbout 7,000 employees will be affected by the decisions, a Fonterra spokeswoman told Reuters. Fonterra has a total workforce of more than 22,000 people, according to its 2018 annual report.\n\nHurrel said bonuses based on sales and short-term incentives for the year will not be paid.\n\n\u201cTogether as a Co-operative we must do what\u2019s right, working together to reset our business and get us back to a position where we can be proud of our financial performance.\u201d\n\nEmployees on collective agreements earning less than NZ$100,000 will not be affected, he said.\n\nFonterra has taken a series of write downs after it found a few assets to be over-valued, including a Brazilian joint venture with Nestle SA (NESN.S) and farms it owns in China.\n\nLast month, the dairy giant said it was on track to post a full year loss of as much as NZ$675 million, following a loss of NZ$196 million in 2018.\n\nThe company will report annual results on Sept. 12.", "description": "New Zealand dairy group Fonterra , which is expected to report its worst annual loss next week, has scrapped bonuses and frozen the pay of about 7,000 employees, according to an internal email to staff seen by Reuters.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426346739&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8401G"}
