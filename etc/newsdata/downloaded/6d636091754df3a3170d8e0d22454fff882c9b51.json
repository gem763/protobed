The practice took place the night of October 31, the day before All Saints' Day (which is November 1). Originally, it was more of a religious exercise where \"soulers\" would go from door to door, praying for the people inside in exchange for food. When the tradition made its way to the US, it had become more of a \"secular pastime,\" TIME reports.\n\nWhat started as revelry outside of tenement apartments in the late 19th century went mainstream by the 1930s with the new name \"trick-or-treating\" (a term that first appeared publicly in print in 1927, per Smithsonian Magazine). The boom of suburbia in the 1950s provided the backdrop that we associate with modern trick-or-treating nowadays.\n\nHere are 13 photos showing the evolution of trick-or-treating in the US over the past five decades.\n\n\u00c1ine Cain contributed to this report.", "description": "From kids in E.T. masks at Boston's Museum of Science in 1982 to slices of bread dancing at the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade in NYC in 1983.", "authors": ["Rebecca Aydin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db84512dee0193e955d8107?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
