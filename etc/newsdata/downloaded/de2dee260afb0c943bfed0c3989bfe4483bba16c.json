That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\nAsked for his thoughts on the penalty Monday, Fangio said, \u201cIn regard to officiating, I\u2019m just going to quote Sean Payton, who is a much more senior head coach than I am, \u2018We can\u2019t control poor officiating or awful calls.\u2019\u201d\n\nFangio still thought he\u2019d won his first NFL game as a head coach when the clock ran out following Trubisky\u2019s 20-yard pass over the middle to Allen Robinson on fourth-and-15 from his 40. Robinson went to the ground at the Denver 35-yard line just as the clock hit 1 second.\n\nWhen that last second ticked off, the Broncos began celebrating only to see rookie referee Adrian Hill huddle with his crew and then put 1 second back on the clock, saying Chicago had called its final timeout in the nick of time.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think there was,\u201d a second left, Fangio insisted. \u201cHe went down at 0:01 and nothing in life, in the world, happens simultaneously. There is lag time there, and they didn\u2019t deem there was lag time there.\u201d\n\nEddy Pineiro\u2019s 53-yard field goal sent the Broncos to 0-2 for the first time since 1999, when John Elway retired, Steve Atwater bolted and Shannon Sharpe and Terrell Davis suffered season-ending injuries following back-to-back Super Bowl triumphs.\n\n\u201cI thought we won,\u201d Derek Wolfe said. \u201cAnd then I was like, \u2018Wait, how are they kicking a field goal? The time is out.\u2019 And then before that, I thought, \u2018How do they call a roughing the passer on Chubb?\u201d\n\nThe call on Chubb was eerily similar to a flag Bears nose tackle Eddie Goldman drew for what looked like a clean hit on Joe Flacco earlier in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn Los Angeles, NFL officiating chief Al Riveron said the whistle never should have been blown on Jordan\u2019s return.\n\n\u201cWe tell our referees when in doubt to let it play out,\u201d Riveron said in the pool report. \u201cIf it is an incomplete pass, we can always come back and make it an incomplete pass. In this situation, as it occurs here, the most we can do is give the ball to the defense. But we cannot, by rule, give them the advance. All we can do is give them the ball at the spot of the clear recovery.\u201d\n\nIt looked as if the officials also missed a roughing penalty on that play when defensive tackle David Onyemata hit Goff in the helmet, appearing to yank his facemask.\n\nGene Steratore , ex-NFL official and current rules analyst for CBS Sports, tweeted, \u201cyou have to be 100% sure the QB\u2019s arm is moving forward with control of the ball. The ball was clearly out of Goff\u2019s control and should\u2019ve been ruled a fumble. However, the contact to Goff was roughing the passer and if called, LA would\u2019ve kept the ball.\u201d\n\nThe game was a rematch of the Rams\u2019 26-23 overtime win in New Orleans in the NFC championship game, a game that turned on an uncalled pass interference by Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman.\n\nIn Denver, Fangio disputed two decisions on the final drive but didn\u2019t argue with the four holding calls called on his left tackle Garett Bolles , giving him 34 infractions in 34 NFL starts.\n\nOnly one of the flags came while Bolles was blocking Khalil Mack.\n\n\u201cThe unusual part of those is when you hear one guy got called for four holdings, you\u2019re immediate thought is passing. Three of the four were on running plays,\u201d Fangio said.\n\nActually, it\u2019s not that unusual.\n\nLost in the hoopla surrounding the new pass interference rule that allows coaches to challenge calls and non-calls - a direct result of what happened in the NFC championship game - is another point of emphasis this season: backside offensive holding.\n\nIt\u2019s been flagged more than 90 times so far, double the number through two weeks last season.\n\n\u201cThose are drive stoppers,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cSo, we\u2019ve got to be able to block our guy without holding.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sean Payton found a way to get his dig in on the officials, and so did Vic Fangio .", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/bears_broncos_football_76047_c0-198-4748-2966_s1770x1032.jpg?893a541524dc2b4701d25558949197f99cc62f42", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
