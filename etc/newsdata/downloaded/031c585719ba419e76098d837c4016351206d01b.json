Since 1999, 612,310 Americans died from firearm injuries that were either due to suicide, homicide, accidental or of some other undetermined cause. Nearly one-fifth of those deaths happened in just those last three years.\n\nThe study, published in the latest issue of Health Affairs, a peer-reviewed journal, by a team led by University of Michigan researchers, used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Jason Goldstick, a research assistant professor of emergency medicine at the U-M Medical School who led the analysis, said the data revealed \u201ca worsening epidemic of firearm mortality.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Pelosi, Schumer blast McConnell over inaction on gun-control legislation\n\nThere were dramatically different rates of firearm mortalities across the U.S. From 1999 to 2017, firearm deaths increased by over 20% in some states, but others saw declines. New York, California and Washington, D.C., which have stricter gun-control laws, had a decline in firearm deaths. Those three areas, plus Arizona and Nevada, also saw a fall in firearm deaths from 1999 to 2017.\n\nMen experienced a higher increase in firearm deaths than women, and Hispanic whites \u2014 American citizens who are racially white and of Hispanic descent and/or speak Spanish natively \u2014 were the only racial/ethnic group that saw reductions in firearm mortality, while firearm mortality rates among both non-Hispanic whites and African-Americans \u201cincreased significantly,\u201d the study said.\n\nRecommended: \u2018Your way of life is under assault,\u2019 Trump says at fiery GOP rally\n\nThese trends in firearm deaths have implications for prevention, particularly in relation to how gun-control legislation should be enacted, Goldstick said. \u201cFor instance, suicide remains the most common mechanism of firearm mortality in most states\u201d and prevention efforts could focus on the highest-risk groups for suicide, such as older males and adults in rural areas, he added.\n\nTo help reduce the number of women fatalities, the researchers recommended restricting firearm access among domestic violence offenders and people convicted of violent crime. To address suicides and unintentional deaths by firearms among young people, they said reducing access to firearms by children would likely help to reduce fatalities among this group of Americans.\n\nAlso see: \u2018Hell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u2019 says Beto O\u2019Rourke at debate\n\nThree-quarters of all U.S. murders in 2017 (14,542 out of 19,510) involved a firearm, according to separate analysis by the Pew Research Center; 51% of all suicides that year (23,854 of 47,173) involved a gun. Six-in-ten gun-related deaths were suicides (23,854), 37% were murders (14,542). The rest were unintentional (486), involved law enforcement (553) or had unknown causes (338).\n\nPew noted one bright spot in the statistics related to gun deaths: While 2017 saw the highest total number of gun deaths in the U.S., \u201con a per capita basis, there were 12 gun deaths per 100,000 people in 2017 \u2014 the highest rate in more than two decades, but still well below the 16.3 gun deaths per 100,000 people in 1974, the highest rate in the CDC\u2019s online database,\u201d the think tank said.", "description": "Nearly one-fifth of firearm deaths over the last two decades occurred between 2015 and 2017, new figures show.", "authors": ["Quentin Fottrell", "Personal Finance Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GE854_anti_g_ZG_20180305104835.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
