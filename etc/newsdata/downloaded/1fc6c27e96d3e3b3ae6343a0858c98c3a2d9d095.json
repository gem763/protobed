Erdogan had long wanted to launch a military offensive against the U.S.-backed Kurdish militias across the border in Syria. And the U.S. had for months promised the Kurds, who have been a vital partner in the five-year war against ISIS, ongoing U.S. support.\n\nBut Trump did it anyway.\n\nDuring or immediately after the call, the officials say, Trump decided on the fly to pull U.S. forces out of a 20- to 30 mile-wide buffer zone in Kurdish-held territory in northern Syria ahead of a declared Turkish attack. \u201cThere was none of the usual process behind this decision,\u201d said one of the three officials, all of whom work on Mideast issues and spoke to TIME on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cNo NSC meetings, no deputies\u2019 meetings, no principals\u2019 committee, not even a dedicated intelligence briefing.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s decision to remove the more than 50 U.S. troops from the area, which was announced late Sunday night in a White House press release, surprised officials at the State and Defense Departments, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Jim Jeffrey, the Administration\u2019s Special Representative for Syria Engagement. Just three days earlier, Esper had discussed a continuing American effort to negotiate safe zones and joint patrols with the Turks along the Turkey-Syria border with Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar. The \u201csecurity mechanism\u201d in northeast Syria was negotiated to avoid bloodshed between the Kurdish and Turkish forces, both U.S. allies.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Rather than stick to a detailed script provided by his aides, with calculated and forseeable consequences, Trump has opted to improvise, judge risk on the fly and quickly make a decision, often contrary to the advice of top U.S. generals and national security advisers.\n\nAt times, his top aides and his backers in Congress have fallen into line or at least played along. This time, the reaction was different.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision drew widespread condemnation across Washington, even among senior Republicans, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham. Prior Administration officials like Nikki Haley, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and Brett McGurk, the former counter-ISIS envoy at the State Department also attacked the decision. \u201cThe consequences of such unreliability from the Oval will reverberate well beyond Syria,\u201d McGurk posted on Twitter. \u201cThe value of an American handshake is depreciating. Trump today said we could \u2018crush ISIS again\u2019 if it regenerated. With who? What allies would sign up? Who would fight on his assurances?\u201d\n\nTrump defended his decision on Twitter Monday by threatening to \u201cobliterate\u201d and \u201cdestroy\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if Erdogan took any steps Trump considered to be \u201coff limits.\u201d \u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!).\u201d It was not clear what if any limits Trump had in mind for the NATO ally.\n\nThe Kurds have been critical to the U.S. efforts to coordinate among dozens of armed groups that were trying to overthrow the government of President Bashar Assad, fight ISIS, and battle one another all at the same time. Operating in the northeast part of the country, U.S. Special Operations advisers steadily began to build up the Syrian Democratic Forces, of which the Kurds are an integral part, by training and arming them. Kurdish leadership knew the relationship was one of convenience, but hoped it wouldn\u2019t end abruptly. Although ISIS is no longer in control of any major city in Iraq or Syria, the fighting is not over completely.\n\nMichael Nagata, a retired Army Lieutenant General who retired as strategy director from the National Counterterrorism Center in August, said the danger of the president\u2019s unpredictability in policy matters is an erosion of confidence and credibility among allies, which also may present opportunities for adversaries. Adversaries like Russia and Iran may seek to test American resolve in the region. Allies, like Jordan and Israel, may second-guess the United States\u2019 willingness to come to their defenses.\n\n\u201cObviously, our credibility is the primary foundation of our influence. And to whatever degree this decision harms our credibility, it directly affects our influence,\u201d Nagata says. \u201cWhat people in the region are going to pay attention to is whether or not America\u2019s decision in northeast Syria is an indication of a reduction in the reliability of the U.S. They\u2019re going to ask themselves: \u2018Is America still a reliable strategic actor in the Middle East?\u2019\u201d\n\nKurdish forces relayed their sense of betrayal in a series of posts on Twitter, arguing that the U.S. had urged their forces to remove military fortifications and combat forces between observation posts along the Turkish border as part of the \u201csecurity mechanism.\u201d That demilitarization will allow Turkey to move in without much of a fight.\n\nBacked by Iranian military aid and Russian airpower, Assad has nearly defeated the Islamist-dominated rebel groups that rose in the chaos of Syria\u2019s 2011 revolution. The insurgents still hold scraps of territory, but have no hope of challenging Assad\u2019s hold on power. As a result, Iran and Russia have vastly extended influence and reach inside Syria. The only check on that power is the total U.S. presence in the country of about 1,000 troops.\n\nThe challenge that has vexed current and former counterterrorism experts is how to pull out of the country without allowing the last remaining ISIS fighters to reform and become a threat again, just as they did when the U.S. pulled out of Iraq.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces are currently in control of more than 30 detention facilities that hold about 11,000 ISIS detainees across northern Syria. In addition, they run a camp for internally displaced persons known as al-Hol, located in northeastern Syria, which holds nearly 70,000 people including thousands of ISIS family members, according to a recent Defense Department Inspector General\u2019s report.\n\nWhile Trump said ISIS detainees would be turned over to Turkey, it is unlikely that there will be a transitional handover among sworn enemies. Analysts inside and outside the government fear the detainees could get an opportunity to escape, or simply be set free as Syrian Democratic Forces fall back to protect their own towns and homes from a Turkish assault.\n\nPentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman issued a statement Monday that said the U.S. military leaders told Turkish officials that America does \u201cnot endorse\u201d a Turkish offensive in northern Syria. \u201cWe will work with our other NATO allies and Coalition partners to reiterate to Turkey the possible destabilizing consequences of potential actions to Turkey, the region, and beyond.\u201d\n\nBut one Administration official said at this point it\u2019s easier for Trump to withdraw troops than it is to take back his words. \u201cThe damage is done,\u201d the official says, \u201cand even if the Turks don\u2019t move, it can\u2019t be undone.\u201d\n\nWrite to W.J.
