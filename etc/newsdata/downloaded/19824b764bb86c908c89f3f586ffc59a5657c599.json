(Oct. 28) AP\n\nTens of thousands of residents who evacuated a sprawling Northern California wildfire fueled by high winds and drought conditions were rocked by another slap from Mother Nature on Monday when a magnitude 3.3 earthquake rattled the area.\n\nNo damage or injuries were immediately reported from the temblor, centered a few miles from the roaring Kincade Fire, that struck at 1:10 a.m. The fire itself remained just 5% contained as it chewed through 85 square miles and almost 100 buildings.\n\nAnother 80,000 homes, businesses and other buildings were threatened by the blaze that accounted for most of the state's 200,000 evacuees.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric said it has cut off power to almost 1 million customers to prevent high winds from sparking wildfires. Another 100,000 customers lost power because of the wild weather. And more bad news was on the horizon.\n\n\"PG&E is monitoring a third consecutive Severe Wind Event for Tuesday and Wednesday that could impact nearly 32 Counties Across Northern and Central California,\" the utility warned in a statement.\n\nFirefighters battle the Kincade Fire along Chalk Hill Road in Healdsburg, California, on Oct. 27, 2019.

A brush fire near the Getty Center that ignited early Monday quickly grew to 250 acres and forced evacuation of 3,300 homes, Los Angeles Fire Department Captain Erik Scott said.\n\n'We want people to now enact predetermined plans, grab their belongings, their medications, take care of their pets and be able to get out of that area in a safe and calm manner,\" Scott said. \"This is a very dynamic fire and all residents ... need to be vigilant and stay informed.\"\n\nAmong those flushed from their homes near Los Angeles was Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James, who posted social media posts detailing how he and his family had sought a hotel after being forced to evacuate.\n\n\"Finally found a place to accommodate us!\" James later tweeted. \"Crazy night man!\"\n\nAnd later: \"My best wishes as well to the first responders right now doing what they do best!\"\n\nSouthern California Edison had tapped a PSPS to cut power to a few hundred customers but warned that up to 300,000 could see their power shut off in coming days.\n\n\"Red Flag Warnings in effect for much of LA/Ventura counties,\" the National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned. \"Fire Weather Watches now posted for the second and potentially stronger Santa Ana wind event late Tuesday night to Thursday.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/28/kincade-fire-earthquake-rattles-area-thousands-flee/4094996002/", "description": "Residents who evacuated a sprawling Northern California wildfire were rocked by another slap from Mother Nature - a 3.3 magnitude earthquake.", "authors": ["John Bacon", "Published A.M.
