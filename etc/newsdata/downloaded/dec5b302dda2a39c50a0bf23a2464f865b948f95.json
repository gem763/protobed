I wanted a hot dog and some clams. I\u2019m eating my Nathan\u2019s, and this guy Lou comes up, and he\u2019s like, \u201cHey, are you going to the beard competition?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cVery funny, man.\u201d He leaves and comes back with this other guy, and he\u2019s like, \u201cTony, this guy\u2019s coming to the competition.\u201d Then I realized he was serious. My girlfriend was hoping for a nice dinner, not a beard competition, but I was like, \u201cBabe, I gotta go with Lou and Tony.\u201d\n\nHow\u2019d your beard do?\n\nIt was like bringing a knife to a gunfight. Everyone\u2019s dressed up like a colonel, and there\u2019s one guy trying to bribe the judges with cash. And there\n\nI am in my bat-mitzvah khakis.\n\nLee Fenwick, 50, Personal Trainer, Connecticut. Photo: Kyle Dorosz\n\nAdam Rinn, 47, Sideshow Performer, Long Island.

Those guys are beard goals, so it\u2019s a big compliment.\n\nChristopher Crescenzo, 36, Self-Employed, Queens. Photo: Kyle Dorosz\n\nRyan Gasuk, 35, Stay-at-Home Dad, Connecticut.

I\u2019m like, \u201cDon\u2019t do that, please.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Meyerson, 33, Musician, Brooklyn. Photo: Kyle Dorosz\n\nAntony Solino, 47, Teacher, Brooklyn. Photo: Kyle Dorosz\n\nAngad S.

I placed eighth at the world competition in Antwerp. I have a vanity license plate that says XLBEARD.\n\nRob Weiner, 51, Unemployed, Long Island. Photo: Kyle Dorosz\n\nDo you get a lot of attention?\n\nOnce someone told me they saw me on a documentary about sideshows. I was like, \u201cI\u2019ve never been in a documentary.\u201d\n\nGerry Spiller, 40, Mover, New Hampshire. Photo: Kyle Dorosz\n\nMark Burdick, 50, Pile Driver, Connecticut.
