I just think it\u2019s the height of hypocrisy for Donald Trump and his family to say anything about any other family\u2019s foreign interests anywhere in the world. Even though he\u2019s president, he has worked, his sons are running his company, and they have work in two dozen countries including Turkey, in Istanbul, and we know what\u2019s going on in Turkey.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cAnd the other thing is, Ivanka works in the White House and she just got all these trademarks from China. Jared is meeting with people in the White House, he works in the White House, meeting with people for loans which he received. So don\u2019t tell me that his family isn\u2019t using the office of the presidency almost like a cash register. So he should say nothing about no one. Just my opinion.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Tuesday's broadcast of ABC's \"The View,\" co-host and network legal analyst Sunny Hostin said President Donald Trump's family was \"using the office of | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/09/Sunny-Hostin-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
