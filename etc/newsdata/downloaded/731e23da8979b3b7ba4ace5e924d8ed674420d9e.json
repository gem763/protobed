After some delay she was told it would be sorted out.\n\nOne reader was left waiting in vain for nine weeks when he tried to pen Junior Isas for his grandchildren with Fidelity\n\nWe received a letter saying one Junior Isa would proceed on May 25 \u2014 but there was no mention of the other so we chased again and again without success.\n\nHow can such a large organisation cause such a fiasco?\n\nR. D., Kent.\n\nFidelity made a mess of this one. It couldn't identify you electronically so asked for your passport (as you're 86 it was lucky you had one!).\n\nOnce it had identified you, it swung into inaction so you were forced to start chasing. On April 26 it opened your grandson's investment but had still done nothing about your granddaughter's.\n\nYou complained to the head of client services and the head of client engagement \u2014 but Fidelity responded to your daughter. This was because they had made her the registered contact, which presumably happened when she dealt with the issue by phone.\n\nFidelity admits the failure to explain this to you was a mistake. It offered \u00a350 to apologise for the delay in resolving your case.\n\nHowever, when I intervened it looked again and has paid a \u00a3250 goodwill gesture to you as well as \u00a3300 (including the original \u00a350) to your daughter.\n\nAn apologetic spokesman says: 'We're sorry to hear your reader's recent experience with Fidelity has fallen short of the service he should expect from us.\n\n'We have spoken to him and his daughter and the Jisa account is now set up.\n\n'In addition, we have offered to make the necessary amendments should they wish to invest any missed contributions.\n\n'We recognise that this has been a time-consuming and frustrating experience for them.'\n\nYou have YOUR say Every week Money Mail receives hundreds of your letters and emails about our stories. Here are some about our article on the savings accounts which pay shamefully low interest rates. One bank should take the lead by pushing up its mortgage rate to 25 per cent so it can pay us savers a decent return. A. K., Devon. I had all of my savings in an account which paid just 0.01 per cent in interest. I closed the account and put it all my cash in premium bonds. The return is equivalent to an interest rate of 1.4 per cent and the money is safe. I. G., Norwich. Banks are making money out of us through overdraft fees and credit card charges. So many people are in debt, but banks and building societies are just not paying customers back. We need more regulation. F. H., Garstang, Lancashire. Considering annual inflation is around 2.5 per cent. If your money is sitting in any of these, you're becoming poorer. K. M., Kent. As someone with a large mortgage, I am happy with low interest rates. I make 6 to 7 per cent on my stocks and shares Isas and my Sipp. You will never make as much from cash savings. S. S., Southend. Savers do have to take some responsibility for their money. If you see rates falling, you should look around for a better deal elsewhere. Just as you shop around for utilities, you have to do the same with your finances. B. S., Bristol. My building society offers rates as high as 1.4 per cent for savers \u2014 but you have to be a new customer. The only easy access accounts available to existing customers pay just 0.5 per cent. P. C., by email.\n\nI am seeking help over savings interest calculations being charged by HMRC. I received \u00a31,358.64 interest in the 2017/18 tax year.\n\nAfter taking off my savings personal allowance of \u00a31,000 this leaves a balance of \u00a3358.64 on which 20 per cent tax is payable.\n\nA letter from HMRC confirmed that I would have to pay \u00a372.80.\n\nI then received a tax demand for \u00a3157.80 in February, corrected to \u00a372 after I pointed out that they had included the same lot of interest twice.\n\nThen it was changed to \u00a376. More recently I received a calculation showing \u00a3262.60.\n\nThis would imply untaxed interest of \u00a32,307, which I have not received. We pensioners always seem to get a hard time.\n\nD. R., Cardiff.\n\nWhat a shame you are retired. Your arithmetic appears to be far superior to that of those you are dealing with at HMRC.\n\nPerhaps they should offer you a job to go through and highlight their errors. Yours is one of a number of cases I've received from pensioners whose interest has been well and truly cocked up by HMRC.\n\nAs you point out, it shouldn't be difficult to get it right as HMRC is in receipt of exactly the same information we receive from banks and building societies.\n\nHMRC admits the problem here was 'an incorrect tax calculation issued by us, caused by issues with the way the untaxed interest was recorded'.\n\nIt has corrected this and explained everything in a letter to you along with an apology.\n\nAs you correctly calculated you owe just \u00a372.\n\nAn HMRC spokesman says: 'We are sorry that our customer did not receive the high level of service she would expect from us. We have now corrected the issue and written to her to explain what happened.'\n\nStraight to the point I have not been a member of the AA since 2014. But on July 30 it took \u00a389.99 out of my Barclaycard account. The AA says the payment related to my wife's Halifax account, but I don't know what they are talking about. N. C., by email. The AA says the money was taken from your account to pay for a new car battery. It adds that at no point did it say anything about the payment being related to your wife's bank account. It is satisfied it has done nothing wrong. If you did not give permission for the battery purchase, report the fraud to your bank. *** My Aer Lingus flight from LA to Manchester was delayed by four hours. Can I claim compensation under EU law if my plane took off from a airport outside Europe? R.G., Manchester. Under EU regulation 261, you are entitled to flight delay compensation if your flight departs from an airport in Europe or you are flying with a European airline \u2014 which Aer Lingus is. But the reason for the delay must be within the airline's control to be eligible for a payout. *** I rang Skoda two weeks ago to end a car lease agreement. I'm still waiting for someone to pick up the car and I've been told that if the vehicle is damaged during this time I will have to pay for repairs. How can this be fair when the contract has ended? B.M., Leighton Buzzard. Skoda says that it states in your contract that you are responsible for the car until it is collected. But the firm has now arranged a date for collection so you hopefully won't have to worry about this much longer. *** I want to switch from Virgin Media but last time I tried I ended up on another contract paying even more. The firm is now charging me \u00a373 for a package that would cost me just \u00a333 with Sky. Virgin has now told me that if I want to leave I will have to pay a \u00a3552 early termination fee. J. D., Wolverhampton. Virgin Media insists the details of the new package, including the early disconnection fee, were clearly explained to you in July. But it admits that when you called recently you were given the wrong information as the exit fee should actually be \u00a3240. The good news is that given the confusion Virgin has now agreed to waive this charge.\n\nI have a problem with British Gas. I have always paid my energy by direct debit yet am receiving letters claiming I haven't paid and owe money.\n\nWhen I received the first email I thought it was a scam so phoned using a different number to that on the email.\n\nThe person I spoke to confirmed it was a scam and should be ignored \u2014 so imagine my surprise when I received another letter making the same demand.\n\nI phoned again and was told it was an error by British Gas and I should ignore the letter.\n\nSeveral days later I received another letter saying \u00a313 would be added to the bill if I did not pay immediately.\n\nThis has been going on for weeks and I feel emotionally distressed by it all.\n\nR. W., Essex.\n\nBritish Gas apologises. It had previously agreed to write off the amount it claimed was owed so another letter should not have been sent. Yet it was!\n\nSomeone has now phoned you to apologise.\n\nThe issue has now been resolved and they have paid \u00a350 credit to your account in recognition of the inconvenience and distress you have suffered.\n\nWell done for your reaction to the initial contact. Phoning on a different number to the one supplied is precisely the thing to do when you are not sure if a letter is a scam.\n\nIf you receive a phone call you think is dodgy, try to ring back from a different number just in case the scammer has kept your line open.", "description": "I tried to set up Junior Isas for my two grandchildren with Fidelity, planning to contribute \u00a3100 per month.
