That might happen here and there if you're shutting the Fold in a hurry, but it's unlikely that someone would shut the Fold that hard so often, or for 14 hours straight.\n\nThere is nothing that replicates human behavior here. If anything, it's frankly impressive that the Galaxy Fold survived as long as it did in CNET's test.\n\nBy comparison, here's a clip of Samsung's own test where the company claimed it could last up to 200,000 folds and unfolds. It's less barbaric - soothing, even. And at the very least, closer to how a human would actually open and close the Galaxy Fold:\n\nYou can scroll through CNET's YouTube video timeline below:\n\nThere's increased attention on Samsung's revised Galaxy Fold, as the first wave of devices in April started breaking far too easily in the hands of reviewers.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "CNET demonstrates the tech equivalent of a brutal medieval torture designed to break the will of dissidents and heretics alike.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7891/43f49c938f714db7ab098cad2e7ca87e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
