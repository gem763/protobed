Bringing on Jones at one point, co-host Brian Kilmeade asked the ex-Marine for his thoughts on O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal to ban certain weapons.\n\n\u201cNo, you won\u2019t, Beto,\u201d Jones replied. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t. You couldn\u2019t take my girl and you haven\u2019t earned my respect. How are you going to take my guns? That\u2019s my response there.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 insult of O'Rourke comes the morning after a Texas lawmaker told the presidential hopeful that \u201cmy AR is ready for you,\u201d a tweet that was later taken down for violating Twitter\u2019s standards on threats of violence.\n\nAfter his 4chan-like attack on O\u2019Rourke, Jones went on to say there are no current pieces of legislation in Congress that would actually stem gun violence because \u201cguns used in places like Chicago\u201d are \u201calready owned and used illegally.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so this is a red herring,\u201d Jones added. \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional talking point the Democrats are using and to an extent it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nJones further noted that there is no need to pass \u201cuniversal background checks\u201d because the government is \u201cso inept at doing its own job\u201d that firearms dealers will just hand over weapons while the government processes the background checks. (The Odessa shooter, meanwhile, did not pass a federal check.)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the type of system we have in place,\u201d he declared. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how bad the government is at enacting it. By all means, let\u2019s pass legislation that\u2019s tremendously more burdensome and that much harder to enforce.\u201d\n\nKilmeade would go on to credit the president for signing the Fix NICS Act that improved current background checks and banned bump stocks, prompting Jones to agree with these specific moves. The military veteran then proposed another idea.\n\n\u201cThe second thing I would do is I would love to have law enforcement in every city in this country have the ability to throw the book at people that commit gun crime instead of using things like their ethnic background or low income as reasons for them not to go to jail,\u201d Jones opined. \u201cThose things are things we can fix through other programs. People that are of a certain race should never be targeted. But to use that as a reason to not put someone in jail who has used a gun in a crime makes no sense.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
