I will probably be the underdog, coming through qualifying. I know back home in Australia, we all like underdogs,\" he said.\n\n\"I hope to bring my best tennis, a physical brand of tennis, and really just give it all for one more match. That's all I want to do.\"", "description": "World No 1 Novak Djokovic has cruised into the Japan Open final, thrashing David Goffin in straight sets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1399/07abf8664c23430d8349bdf0c850f554.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
