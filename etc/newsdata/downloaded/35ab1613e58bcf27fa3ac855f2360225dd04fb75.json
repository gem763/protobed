Some of the officials had applied for grants through her department, it added.\n\nOfficials from Indiana and Georgia followed with 6 percent of the meetings each, according to Politico.

She just doesn\u2019t do that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I heard that repeatedly: \u2018We offered and we were told she just doesn\u2019t do trips. That\u2019s just not her thing,\u201d Osborne continued.\n\nThe agency spokesperson also disputed the reporting on Chao not traveling, adding that the secretary has \u201cvisited many sites.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 11:41 a.m.", "description": "Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao met with officials from Kentucky, which her husband,\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R), represents, much more than officials from any other state, according to a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/chaoelaine_091919gn6_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
