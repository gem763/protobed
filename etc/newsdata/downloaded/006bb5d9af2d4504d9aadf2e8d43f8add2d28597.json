But they have grown again since India revoked a constitutional clause that endowed semi-autonomous status on the part of Kashmir under its control in August. India moved hundreds of thousands of troops to the region and carried out thousands of arrests.\n\nKhan said the move was driven by the Hindu nationalist ideology of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, whom he called a \u201cfascist\u201d.\n\nThe Muslim-majority territory is currently under curfew, but Khan predicted a popular backlash once the curfew is lifted.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll come out on the streets. What happens then?\u201d Khan told journalists at the UN general assembly. He pointed to the presence of a 900,000-strong Indian force there currently enforcing the curfew.\n\n\u201cI fear there will be a massacre and things will start to go out of control,\u201d the Pakistani leader said.\n\n\u201cMy main reason for coming here was to meet world leaders at the UN and speak about this. We are heading for a potential disaster of proportions that no one here realises,\u201d Khan said. \u201cIt is the only time since the Cuban crisis that two nuclear-armed countries are coming face to face. We did come to face to face in February.\u201d\n\nKhan has vowed to defend Pakistani territory but has also expressed fear of an uncontrolled escalation. He spoke on Wednesday about his dilemma on being told of the Indian air strikes.\n\n\u201cIn February, my army chief calls me up and the air force chief, [saying] that Indian jets have come and bombed Pakistan territory. What do we do? What do we do?\u201d Khan said. \u201cShould I \u2013 should we \u2013 have to make that choice.\u201d\n\nHe said he had expressed his fears in conversations this week with Donald Trump, Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson.\n\nTrump has offered to mediate, but only if both Pakistan and India agree. India has been resistant to outside mediation, and Modi has presented his actions in Indian-controlled Kashmir as essential to counter separatism and terrorism, which he accuses Pakistan of fomenting.\n\nBut Khan has faced an uphill task. Trump has become a close political ally of Modi, even appearing as the Indian prime minister\u2019s guest last Sunday at a Texas rally of some Indian Americans. But on Monday, Trump described some of Modi\u2019s rhetoric as \u201cvery aggressive\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have tried my best,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWhat options do we have? What do we do? Do we just wait for this nightmare scenario to unfold and hope that nothing happens.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Khan said he had been asked by both the US and Saudi Arabia to act as a mediator with Iran.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump asked me and also Prince Mohammed bin Salman asked me to speak to the Iranians, and we are trying our best that this should not develop into a conflict,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThe good thing about President Trump is that I feel he\u2019s not a pro-war person, although I can see that there are others who are egging him on. But his instinct, quite rightly is not for war ... I think that\u2019s very admirable.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "Pakistan PM says he has tried to tell world leaders of growing risk of conflict with India over disputed region", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80d0a3768348fb08423505045902e84085152899/0_22_4159_2495/master/4159.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dddae0483fef04b82e1c4123ecc0c73e", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
