Just as it is Bodyguard (thanks to Andrew Raeburn). I have done countries that used to be \u201cthe\u201d (Netherlands, Ukraine and so on) but here are 10 other things.\n\n1. Spice Girls. Top of a long list of pop groups to spurn the definite article. Nominated by David Lister. Phil Riley adds: \u201cGlenn and Don were very insistent that the band were known as Eagles, not The Eagles \u2013 a forlorn hope if you ask me.\u201d Also: Small Faces (Judith Clare), Pixies, Manic Street Preachers (Mark Hobbs), Pet Shop Boys (Beverley Barrett) and Cocteau Twins (Tim Farron). At the other end of the spectrum is The The, a band that made fun of the self-importance of some of \u201cThe\u201d Big Names.\n\n2. BuzzFeed\u200b. David Cameron once referred to \u201cthe BuzzFeed\u201d in a revealing dad moment. Similarly, various newspapers do not have \u201cthe\u201d on their masthead, including Church Times, Daily Express, Daily Mail, Daily Mirror, Evening Standard, i, Metro, Sunday Express and Sunday Mirror.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n3. Messiah. Handel\u2019s. Nominated by Chris Smith.\n\n4. Her Majesty\u2019s Ships. Even The Independent (which does take the definite article) has referred, for example, to \u201cThe HMS Prince of Wales, sunk by the Japanese, killing 840 UK soldiers\u201d. We would not dream of saying (the sinking was in 1941), \u201cthe His Majesty\u2019s Ship Prince of Wales\u201d, would we? Thanks to Peter Elliott, who adds: \u201cIt might be permissible to say, \u2018the captain of the Troutbridge,\u2019 but I believe that a member of the royal navy is more likely to say: \u2018I served in Troutbridge.\u2019\u201d\n\n5. Flying Scotsman \u2013 \u201cunless referring to the service rather than the locomotive\u201d. Absolutely world-class pedantry there from Ben Yates.\n\n6. Red House, \u201chome of William and Jane Morris and the centre of the Pre-Raphaelite circle\u201d, now a National Trust property. Thanks to Robert Harris.\n\n7. Today. BBC Radio 4 programme that some people listen to. Thanks to Stair at the Sky.\n\n8. Carnival. The Notting Hill one. Topical nomination from Mark.\n\n9. Acts of parliament. According to Rich Greenhill, The Waterford and Wexford Railway Act 1871 is the most recent of about eight acts that have \u201cthe\u201d at the start of their name. The most famous is The Petition of Right, which provided in 1627 that \u201cthe king\u2019s subjects should not be taxed but by consent in parliament\u201d.\n\n10. Sajid Javid. Thanks to Ross Smith.\n\nNo room, therefore, for Royal Mail, Rupert Bear or Wirral. And I thought I would prove that I am the people\u2019s pedant by excluding such staples of the genre as hoi polloi, Magna Carta and MCC (Marylebone Cricket Club).\n\nSeveral nominations for the London street that is currently called Strand, but it was originally \u201cThe Strand\u201d.\n\nNext week: Units of measurement, such as in this headline: \u201cAsteroid the size of a double-decker bus flies past Earth.\u201d\n\nComing soon: Jobs held by ex-prime ministers, after David Cameron denied he wanted to come back as foreign secretary.\n\nYour suggestions please, and ideas for future Top 10s, to me on Twitter, or by email to top10@independent.co.uk", "description": "This list was suggested by Dean Bullen, after a pedant pointed out that the metal-detecting TV series is Detectorists,\u00a0not The Detectorists.
