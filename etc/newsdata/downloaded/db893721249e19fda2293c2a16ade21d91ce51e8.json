Then she learned her hijab disqualified her.", "language": "en", "text": "Other team members who\u2019d sat out Abukaram\u2019s race told her what they\u2019d heard: An official at the Ohio High School Athletic Association approached their coach just before the race to say Abukaram needed a waiver to wear her hijab. Without it, she couldn\u2019t compete.\n\n\u201cI was disqualified from something that I love to do because of something that I love,\u201d Abukaram told The Washington Post on Friday. \u201cBecause of something that\u2019s a part of me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAbukaram\u2019s story, shared earlier this week in a Facebook post, has put a spotlight on athletic dress codes that critics say discriminate against Muslims. Abukaram says she\u2019s been overwhelmed with messages sharing support and similar experiences; by Thursday, the issue had even caught the eye of presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), who tweeted to Abukaram, \u201cI\u2019ve got your back.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery kid should be able to feel safe and welcome at school \u2014 and Muslim students should never be denied participation in school activities,\u201d Warren wrote.\n\nAbukaram says her hijab has never posed an issue at meets before. Saturday\u2019s event was her seventh this season, and she\u2019s competed in soccer and track without problems, too.\n\nAD\n\nShe and her headscarf, she says, \u201cgo hand in hand.\u201d She races in long sleeves, leggings and the Nike sports hijab donned by pros and Olympians.\n\nAD\n\nThe idea that her choices as a Muslim could interfere with her athletic pursuits was not new, though. Abukaram says she\u2019s watched her older sister come home crying from soccer games, after being told to change out of religious garb like the long pants she wears in addition to a headscarf.\n\nMany female Muslim athletes face scrutiny for their decision to cover their hair. In France, a brand\u2019s rollout of a \u201crunner\u2019s hijab\u201d stirred a backlash, with the country\u2019s health minister remarking that she \u201cwould have preferred a French brand not to promote the veil.\u201d Ibtihaj Muhammad, the first U.S. athlete to compete in the Olympics with a hijab, has described sticking out uncomfortably at competitions and being asked to remove her headscarf for an event ID photo.\n\nAD\n\nThe Ohio High School Athletic Association says it wasn\u2019t singling out Abukaram last weekend, just enforcing its rules. Students need a waiver to run cross-country in \u201creligious headwear,\u201d spokesman Tim Stried told the New York Times, and Abukaram\u2019s school had not requested one.\n\nAD\n\nAbukaram\u2019s request after Saturday\u2019s race was approved \u201cimmediately,\u201d Stried said. That means Abukaram can run this weekend in regionals.\n\nFor Abukaram, the decision to strike her time was still hurtful. She wants the waiver requirement dropped \u2014 something OHSAA is now considering, Stried told the Times.\n\nAbukaram\u2019s coach wants the policy changed, too.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that this incident highlights how detrimental this rule can be and spurs positive change for our sport,\u201d Jerry Flowers told The Post in an email.\n\nAD\n\nFlowers said he only learned \u201cat the starting line\u201d Saturday that Abukaram would need a waiver. He opted against asking his athlete to remove her hijab or swapping her out for another runner \u2014 and decided not to break the bad news right before she competed.\n\n\u201cShe had earned the right to race with the varsity, so I felt the best thing to do was to let her run unhindered,\u201d Flower said.\n\nAD\n\nAbukaram says word came afterward like a \u201cpunch in the gut.\u201d She respected her coach\u2019s resolve not to shake her concentration, but she wished meet officials had told her earlier.\n\nHer family was equally indignant: \u201cShe earned her time on that race,\u201d said her mother Yolanda Melendez.\n\nAD\n\nHer parents plan to talk with OHSAA about changing the group\u2019s rules. Abukaram is more focused on this weekend\u2019s regional competition, though.\n\nIf things go well, she might wear her hijab at the state race.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Abukaram\u2019s story shines light on student athletic dress codes that critics say discriminate against Muslims.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Nkd_8oC_hhMEKR_5pUmEntsnNAs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DMRR3VFZMBCL3JXAPXZMWTU6CM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
