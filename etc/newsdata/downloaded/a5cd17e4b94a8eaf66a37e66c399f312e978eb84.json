But she said she doesn\u2019t fault Nancy Pelosi for waiting to get on board until this latest incident, in which the president seems to have tried to actually get that kind of help.\n\nHowever, Klobuchar demurred when I asked about the potential impact of impeachment on the presidential race. \u201cIf we\u2019re only looking at everything through a political lens,\u201d she said, \u201cwe are no better than [Trump], because he is only looking at it through a partisan and a personal-enrichment lens. That\u2019s how he sees the world, and we must be better than that as a country.\u201d\n\nWhile many of her 2020 rivals spent the past week away on the campaign trail, chasing votes and donors ahead of the September 30 campaign-finance deadline, Klobuchar was in Washington. She spent so much time in the Senate that I nearly thought she would miss the window for our interview with all the votes on her schedule.\n\nKlobuchar told me she wants to stay focused on the less glamorous work that\u2019s required to get bills passed in the Senate, but she\u2019s trying to do that at a crucial moment in the presidential race, when the field is likely on the verge of shrinking and everyone is fighting for attention. Her campaign has been polling in the mid\u2013single digits, and she\u2019s been trying to stand out by insisting that Democrats need to think hard about what they can pass, rather than just what they can propose. She mentioned ideas such as returning to environmental standards introduced by Barack Obama, passing immigration reform, and \u201cinvesting in impoverished communities and in communities of color.\u201d Contrast that with a line she used last week in Detroit\u2014that some of the ideas being proposed by her Democratic rivals would \u201cscore 100 percent in the faculty lounge.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar insisted she wasn\u2019t just talking about Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has emerged as a leading candidate in the race and who, before entering the Senate, was a Harvard law professor. Warren talks about \u201cbig, structural change\u201d; Klobuchar, by contrast, says ideas like those \u201care good, and they\u2019re good for discussion. But I think if we really want to be bold, then we\u2019ve got to win.\u201d\n\nFor Klobuchar to win, though, she\u2019ll need to actually have a breakout moment\u2014and as the Iowa caucuses get closer and closer, time is running out.", "description": "The 2020 hopeful says Democrats need to think hard about which plans they can pass, not just which ones they can propose.", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/original-1/facebook.jpg?1569560873", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
