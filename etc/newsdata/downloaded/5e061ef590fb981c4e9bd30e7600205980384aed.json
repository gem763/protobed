The Spectator magazine, also owned by the Barclays, is not part of the review.\n\nThe review by Aidan and Howard Barclay, sons of David Barclay, surfaced after the realization that the family is no longer as united as it once was, amid what an insider called a generational shift, the newspaper http://bit.ly/2WgGMZz reported.\n\n\"The family has got a lot bigger over the last three decades. Interests are no longer aligned in the way they once were,\" The Times reported, citing a senior executive close to the Barclays.\n\nThe Telegraph did not immediately respond to a request for comment after market hours on Friday, while representatives for the Barclay family could not be reached.\n\nInsiders told the Times that slimming down the portfolio of investments will generate capital to allow the \"buyout\" of some family members.\n\nEarlier this month, sources told Reuters that David and Frederick Barclay, owners of one of the world's most prestigious hotels, The Ritz London, hinted at selling the establishment for $1 billion.\n\nDavid and Frederick Barclay, who are twins, are known usually to decline interviews and give little away in public about their business strategy.
