By Charging to Shoot It From a Cannon", "language": "en", "text": "Farmers across the U.S. have stumbled onto a fertile side hustle at a time when prices for their crops are low: cramming produce into an air gun and charging people to fire it into the sky.\n\nGrowers of corn, apples and even pumpkins place the agricultural ammo at the base of a long tube, sometimes with the help of a ramrod. Then they use an air compressor to build up enough pressure to send the fruits or vegetables flying hundreds of feet, where they land with a satisfying splat.\n\n\u201cWhy not shoot it?\u201d says Fred Howell, owner of Howell\u2019s Pumpkin Patch in Cumming, Iowa. \u201cWe\u2019re fat Americans and we play with our food.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a way to keep jaded teens and bored adults coming back to spend time and money on the farms while the youngest members of the family are happy petting sheep.\n\nFood cannons alone can\u2019t protect farms from depressed prices. But they are part of the growing field of agritainment\u2014which also includes corn mazes, hayrides and goat yoga\u2014that can serve as a hedge for farmers during tough times. Farm-linked recreation was a nearly $1 billion business in 2017, according to Claudia Schmidt, an assistant professor of agricultural economics at Penn State University.\n\nFarms charge a premium to fire air guns loaded with produce\u2014certainly more than they charge retailers for the regular crop. Corn costs under $4 a bushel today on the open market, less than half the price it sold for in 2012.\n\nMr. Howell charges customers $2 to fire four shots from his corn cannon. By his calculations, that comes out to $100 a bushel. About two acres of corn out of the 100 he grows will end up airborne.\n\nHe admits that it may sound wasteful. But farms often use their worst fruits and vegetables for shooting, including many they can\u2019t legally sell as food. And when the guests are gone, he sometimes fences in the area around the silos for his goats to eat everything clean.\n\nApril Luecht fires an apple cannon at Stepp\u2019s Hillcrest Orchard in Hendersonville, N.C. KEVIN LUECHT\n\nJim Kessinger, owner of Plumper Pumpkin Patch and Tree Farm at the edge of Portland, Ore., says the wormy apples he stuffs in a cannon are worth more than his nicer ones sold as food due to the weak apple market. He calls the produce he fires his farm\u2019s tossed salad department. (Not all produce works so well: Onions exploded in mid-air before hitting anything when he tried them.)\n\nVisitors can fire pumpkins ranging from 1 to 3 pounds and 3 to 5 inches in diameter from one of his farm\u2019s three cannons at four dead cars in a field. That includes his old family minivan. The only thing protecting the cars is how un-aerodynamic pumpkins can be.\n\nJim Kessinger, owner of Plumper Pumpkin Patch and Tree Farm, stands with his pumpkin cannon.

So far, no one has taken him up on the offer. He\u2019s confident the pumpkins could fly a quarter-mile if he\u2019d crank up the air pressure more.\n\nThirty years ago, people might buy 10 bushels of apples during a farm visit, says April Luecht, whose family owns Stepp\u2019s Hillcrest Orchard in Hendersonville, N.C. Now some ask if they can buy four individual pieces of fruit.\n\nTo help make up for lost revenue and keep customers coming, her orchard just added its third apple cannon in time for this September and October\u2019s high season. Visitors had been waiting 30-plus minutes to shoot in previous years.\n\n\u201cWhen they hit a target, it\u2019s just applesauce,\u201d Ms. Luecht says. \u201cIt makes a lot of noise.\u201d\n\nEd Gritsavage says he and all five of his children, ages 6 to 14, enjoy firing the cannon at Stepp\u2019s. \u201cIt feels pretty good. It\u2019s got a nice, powerful shot to it,\u201d says Mr. Gritsavage, a 43-year-old resident of Hendersonville who works as a curatory manager for Bob\u2019s Red Mill, a natural foods company.\n\nHis youngest, Raelin, has been shooting apples since she was 4. \u201cIt\u2019s a good entertainment for the kids,\u201d he says.\n\nThe apple artillery earned the orchard $20,000 in 2018, according to Ms. Luecht. The orchard paid about $5,900 each for the cannons from Lewis Agritainment, a company based in New Era, Mich.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Which vegetable would you shoot out of a cannon? Join the conversation below.\n\nThat company\u2019s owner, Scott Lewis, also runs a working farm and petting zoo. He says he sells between 60 and 70 cannons a year and has an eye on expanding his sales to Europe and China.\n\nThe other major competitor in the food-cannon field is Cajun Country Corn of Pine Grove, La. Owner Donald Courville claims to have made the first commercially sold corn cannon. His company charges as much as $6,435 for its Pumpkin Blaster and $5,335 for its auto-loading apple cannon.\n\nMr. Courville uses the guns on his own farm, too. When a youth group visits, he might hold a shucking contest that leaves him with plenty of corn to shoot. He describes his side business as niche but steady, with a sales pitch that plays to small farms trying to get creative to stay above water.\n\n\u201cAll these people who have corn mazes? Well, guess what. They\u2019ve got ready-made ammunition,\u201d he says.\n\nEthan Kenoyer, 17, fires the corn cannon with Erin Howell-Conner looking on at Howell\u2019s, which charges $2 to fire four shots.

Some fashion braces to limit their apparatus\u2019 range of motion so that it doesn\u2019t swivel in the direction of unintended targets.\n\nFarmers and cannon-makers say that to keep customers protected\u2014and to appease their insurance companies\u2014those kinds of features are essential. They must also be able to let employees safely reload without visitors accidentally firing.\n\nCustomers aren\u2019t allowed within 100 feet of the pumpkin cannon at Stade\u2019s Farm and Market in McHenry, Ill. It has a 42-foot barrel made from an old water main that weighs over a ton and shoots as many as six pumpkins at a time. The biggest weigh 30 pounds.\n\nVern Stade, the farm\u2019s owner, estimates he\u2019s poured $30,000 and countless hours into the cannon since building it in 2003. He and one friend\u2014\u201cGreen Bay\u201d Bob Dow, nicknamed for his unpopular choice of NFL teams in Bears Country\u2014are the only two people allowed to fire it.\n\nMr. Stade says his cannon goes through new target vehicles every couple of weeks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just shoot at it until you can\u2019t even tell it\u2019s a truck,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a ball of crinkled metal.\u201d\n\nThe pumpkin cannon at Stade's Farm and Market in McHenry, Ill.
