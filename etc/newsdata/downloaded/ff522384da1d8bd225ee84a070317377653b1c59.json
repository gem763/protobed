If Boris Johnson was telling the truth, this would be a breach of his obligations to send the letter under the Benn Act. And if Boris Johnson was not telling the truth, this would, it seems to us, be a breach of his obligations not to frustrate the Benn Act.\"\n\nBut in a submission to the court in a previous case last week, the government formally pledged to abide by the Benn Act - the total reverse of what cabinet ministers have been saying in public.\n\nCampaigners had therefore lodged a bid at the Court of Session in Edinburgh to use the Nobile Officium - or \"Nob-Off\" - power, which would allow a court official to send a letter to the EU requesting a delay on Johnson's behalf if he were to refuse.\n\nJohnson 'will comply with the law'\n\nIn the court in Edinburgh on Tuesday, the government argued it had already undertaken to follow the law. Furthermore, its lawyers said, the deadline for a deal had not yet been reached, and so it would be inappropriate for the court to pass judgment at this time.\n\n191008120102295\n\nCampaigners argued that leaving a ruling until after October 19 would cause \"massive\" legal uncertainty; to wait until the deadline had passed would spark serious administrative and practical obstacles to enacting a legal remedy ahead of Britain leaving the EU without a deal on October 31.\n\nBut they say they are happy with the court's announcement on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"These cases are about keeping the prime minister on the straight and narrow,\" said Jolyon Maugham QC, one of the senior lawyers bringing the case.\n\n\"We have extracted from him a promise that he will comply with the law. If he breaks that promise he will face the music - including possible contempt proceedings. And the courts are likely to make good any failure on his part, including signing the Benn Act letter.\"\n\nMedia reports overnight on Tuesday suggested the EU was preparing to make significant concessions over a northern Irish \"consent mechanism\" in Johnson's latest plan.\n\nJohnson's idea is pinned on the UK's suggestion to have two borders around Northern Ireland - turning the existing (invisible) border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member, into a formal customs border (albeit with physical checks and infrastructure some distance from the border itself), with a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, allowing Northern Ireland to remain in the EU's \"single market\".\n\nBut EU officials quashed those reports on Wednesday morning, saying there was \"no bold new offer\" coming from their side, with diplomats dismissing the reports as \"spin\".\n\nThe European Union's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said on Wednesday he believed that reaching an exit deal with Britain was \"very difficult but possible\".\n\n\"The EU will remain calm, vigilant, respectful and constructive. The technical talks continue,\" Barnier said in footage played by Sky News on Twitter.\n\nAsked by a reporter if a deal was possible, he said: \"I think the deal is possible. Very difficult but possible.\"", "description": "Boris Johnson has until October 19 to get a Brexit deal done; the courts will step in on October 22.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/336cecfbc23048859d6a0b57019e8990_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
