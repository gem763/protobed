That is a 66.7 percent increase from 38.8 billion won wrongfully distributed last year.Many of the violations this year were found in welfare subsidy programs, including over 5,000 false claims for basic pension allowances.A Finance Ministry official explained there were numerous violations in the welfare sector as 37.4 trillion won, nearly half of the central government\u2019s subsidy budget this year, was allocated to the Ministry of Health and Welfare\u2019s subsidy programs.Other violations included individuals falsely filing for subsidies under government support programs for businesses affected by Free Trade Agreements.The government effort to crack down on wrongful subsidy collection comes as it looks to maximize fiscal spending as it faces economic uncertainties.The government has proposed a 513.5 trillion won budget for next year, a rise of 9.3 percent from this year\u2019s budget.BY CHAE YUN-HWAN [chae.yunhwan@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
