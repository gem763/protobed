I can help repurpose your rant content | Marina Hyde", "language": "en", "text": "Huge congratulations to the prime minister of Ethiopia, who has just been awarded the Nobel peace prize in Oslo, beating out competition from hotly fancied regional candidate Greta Thunberg. Abiy Ahmed was garlanded for his efforts to achieve peace and international cooperation, and for bringing an end to more than 20 years of conflict between Ethiopia and its neighbouring Eritrea. So yes, this is a victory.\n\nBut in a very real sense, far more deeply felt in the content mills of the west, it is also a tragedy. Clearly, Abiy\u2019s win and Greta\u2019s loss leaves countless angry hacks, pundits, shockjocks, populists, provocateurs and alt-right conspiracists with an unexpected hole in their rant schedule. The crusaders had their already somewhat familiar backlashes against this 16-year-old climate activist all ready to go, and then this absolute dog in the manger goes and ruins it for them. How dare he?! That is the most urgent question we face today.\n\nYou\u2019ll see how easily your criticisms of Greta can be applied to Abiy \u2013 or anyone else who actually cares about anything\n\nFor those guys \u2013 and they are mostly guys, for whatever reason \u2013 I have good news. I\u2019m here to assist! I know the one type of recycling you really commit to is content recycling. Specifically, your own. Some of you are so committed to this lifestyle that you have not actually availed yourself of any new content in years \u2013 so why should this occasion be any different? Why not slightly repurpose your anti-Greta rants to suit the person who did end up winning? Simply take your exact same Greta attack lines, and substitute \u201chim\u201d and \u201chis\u201d for \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cher\u201d. Honestly, you\u2019ll see how easily your rabid criticisms of Greta can be applied to Abiy \u2013 or, indeed, to anyone else, from anywhere, who actually cares about anything, and tries to do something about it. What follows will show you just how interchangeable your theory-of-everything arguments are. And I hope you\u2019ll be grateful for the fact I\u2019ve included a leeetle pushback against each one, just to keep you sharp.\n\n\u201cLike Greta, Abiy\u2019s voice is weird.\u201d Yes, he has an Ethiopian accent. But listen: try not to be overly triggered by people who speak differently to you. If it helps, imagine Greta and Abiy are a pair of European football managers who \u2013 if they finally wearied of humouring your imbecilic questions \u2013 could actually insult members of your trade in at least four languages.\n\n\u201cLike Greta, Abiy can be publicly emotional.\u201d Definitely. In June he was seen weeping at a memorial to an assassinated general. I think people generally prefer the cold, hard logic you scream into the camera on your conspiracy-zine cable show.\n\n\u201cLike Greta, Abiy goes about things the wrong way.\u201d I feel sure you\u2019re on to something here \u2013 Abiy\u2019s brand of politics has been credited for its informality, energy and charisma, and you could definitely pick holes in that. One east African political expert said of Abiy\u2019s rapid achievements in a single year: \u201cFor Ethiopia, a country where everything has been done in a very prescriptive, slow and managed way, these changes are unprecedented.\u201d As you have done with Greta, I know you\u2019ll find a way of tutting that there are established ways of doing things, and those who don\u2019t adhere to them should be treated with suspicion and barely masked fear.\n\nNobel peace prize: Ethiopian prime minister Abiy Ahmed wins 2019 award \u2013 as it happned Read more\n\n\u201cLike Greta, Abiy seems to have a pretty high opinion of himself.\u201d I know, right? People have said this about Abiy. And I know I\u2019ve heard it about Greta. In fact, I think I heard it on TV, from you, one of those times you went all the way out to the Sky TV studios at half past eleven at night to do the paper review to build your media brand.\n\n\u201cLike Greta, Abiy does not speak for working-class people.\u201d This one\u2019s always worth a punt, so wheel it out again. But to clarify, I assume we\u2019re talking about working-class people where you are honking this particular observation, typically a broadcast studio in London? It\u2019s possible you need to get out a little more \u2013 and most particularly, out of broadcast studios. For now, let me bring you up to speed: working-class people in Ethiopia really did care about Abiy\u2019s cause, just as working-class people in, say, the Philippines, definitely care about Greta\u2019s cause, because they\u2019re going to drown before you do. This is how we know there\u2019s no climate justice in the world.\n\n\u201cLike Greta, Abiy just picked a right-on cause.\u201d Well, quite \u2013 and the last thing you should do is wonder why it was right-on. Instead, try to get 10 minutes of talk radio out of explaining why caring about Ethiopia is very Bob Geldof. If anyone can, you can.\n\n\u201cLike Greta, is it possible Abiy is being influenced by his parents?\u201d Both of Abiy\u2019s parents are dead, but this is still an important point: it\u2019s definitely possible they have had an influence on his life. Many people have parents who are or were interested in the things they are interested in, who wished them success, and basically agreed with them on several subjects. Parsing your entire output, I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t. Are these two things maybe connected? I know you value saying the unsayable above all, so in that spirit you\u2019d support me asking: is it possible your parents openly dislike you? Or maybe secretly do?\n\n\u201cLike Greta, shouldn\u2019t Abiy be in school?\u201d Not really. I\u2019m afraid the Ethiopian prime minister is 43, so this is the one point I think you\u2019re going to struggle to upcycle. Still, I\u2019m sure you could imply heavily that he has an awful lot to learn. We all have \u2013 and seemingly from you. As long as asking why someone isn\u2019t in school counts as you being in work, the entire planet should simply thank you for your service.\n\n\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Don\u2019t worry, angry pundits, provocateurs and alt-right conspiracists: you can still use those Nobel-prize attack lines, says Guardian columnist Marina Hyde", "authors": ["Marina Hyde"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc8d54888bc86644eb0e52e41e85467cd231f42f/0_232_3900_2340/master/3900.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=9f941f71fc5ad1f0877945761231a92e", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
