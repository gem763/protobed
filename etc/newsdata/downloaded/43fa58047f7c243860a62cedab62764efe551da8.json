Often, the root issue is arthritis, but that\u2019s not the only one. Old injuries, overuse, or poor diet can all lead to joint stress. Most of my patients with these problems fear going to the doctor. They are scared of getting joint replacement surgery\u2014and rightly so. However, in nearly every case, I\u2019ve been able to help my patients alleviate their pain, reclaim their mobility, and enjoy their lives, without ever needing to go under the knife. Today, I\u2019ll show you exactly how you can do the same. But first\u2014why should you be so wary of surgery in the first place?\n\nThere\u2019s no such thing as safe surgery\n\nStrengthen your joint. Exercise will always have the greatest effect.\n\nWe tend to think of surgery as a painful, but safe, solution to many ills. We think it so safe, that there\u2019s an entire industry of elective surgeries. But the truth is, surgery always comes with risk. One of my coworkers lost a good friend due to an infection she contracted getting a facelift. There is always risk involved in surgery. Now it\u2019s true that some surgeries are riskier than others. It\u2019s harder to operate on a heart or brain than a leg. And some people have greater risk than others. Diabetes or a history of heart trouble, for instance, up the odds that something will go wrong. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important, before any surgery, to ask how high your personal risk is. And you have to weigh that against the benefit. When it comes to joint replacement surgery, the risk is usually higher than the reward demands. As I\u2019ve already said, about 95% of the cases I see can be solved without surgery. In fact, off the top of my head, I can only recall one patient who truly needed surgery. There\u2019s also the fact that, though we don\u2019t think of it this way, joint replacement is a temporary fix. Most replacement joints have a shelf-life of around 20 years\u2014but sometimes much less. If you\u2019re having surgery at 59, you\u2019re most likely going to have to go through the whole process again, at a more advanced age. That\u2019s why the best solution is to avoid surgery altogether, with these three tips.\n\nThe exercise doesn\u2019t have to be strenuous. In fact, when you are trying to help out an ailing joint, it shouldn\u2019t be. Instead, increase your flexibility. Stretch. Give your joints more mobility, and better room to work. For a knee, hug your leg in close to your body, and hold. Do that for each leg three times, 20 seconds each. Stretch out your thigh by holding your foot up against your backside, for the same number of repetitions and time. For hips, crouch down with one leg outstretched to the side. Switch legs back and forth three times. Strengthening the muscles around your joint helps as well, as they can help support your joint, and hold it in place. Lunges\u2014taking a large step forward with one foot, dropping low to the floor so your back knee nearly touches, then getting back up\u2014are a great way to make your entire leg stronger, hip and knees included. Squats are wonderful as well. With your feet planted shoulder-width, lower your backside towards the floor like you\u2019re sitting, with the weight on the back of your feet, and then rise back up. Repeat for sixty seconds. If you have a preferred way to exercise your legs, go for it. Just make sure you speak with a professional if you have any doubt about the safety of an exercise for your joint. You don\u2019t want extra stress\u2014you want extra strength! Speaking of stress, losing weight is a powerful way to decrease the stress on your joints. When you take a step, the impact of your weight is three to six times greater than your actual weight. So a 10-pound loss means a 30-60 pound reduction in joint stress. Find an aerobic exercise that can safely get you sweating. Swimming is a fabulous workout that is generally safe for all your joints.\n\nTake healthy, safe supplements. Glucosamine and chondroitin both are famous for joint relief, but they can take up to eight weeks to \u201ckick in\u201d. UC-II\u2014an especially powerful type of collagen\u2014works a lot faster and can actually halt the autoimmune and enzyme-related actions that cause joint destruction.\n\nAcupuncture and massage. Finally, acupuncture and massage can do wonders for your joints.\n\nAnd hyaluronic acid is a naturally-occurring lubricant that can help relieve arthritic pain. Some doctors give it as an injection, but I find a hyaluronic softgel works very well. Finally, curcumin has proven a godsend when it comes to joint pain. It reduces inflammation, and encourages health in cartilage and the body\u2019s natural lubricants. Look for a form like Cavamax or Meriva that\u2019s optimized for better absorption.Both help alleviate pain. Massage can help increase flexibility. And acupuncture has been in use for 5,000 years for good reason. I\u2019ve seen patients cured overnight with the help of a good acupuncturist. For joints, adding electrical stimulation to your acupuncture can intensify the benefits, and even help strengthen surrounding muscle and tissue. All these solutions are much better options than surgery. They\u2019re cheaper, easier, and will give you better results. Many of us will need surgery on something, someday. But it doesn\u2019t have to be today. And it definitely doesn\u2019t have to be on your knee, or hip. In almost all cases, with a little bit of time and effort, you\u2019ll get much better results with exercise, acupuncture, and healthy, safe supplements.\n\nReferences", "description": "As you age, the odds increase that one of your .09/02/2019 3:21:41AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
