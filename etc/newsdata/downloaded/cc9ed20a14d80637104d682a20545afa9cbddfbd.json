Investigators believe the team used a bone saw to dismember him.\n\nThe CIA later concluded that the Saudi crown prince ordered the killing.\n\nCIA concludes Saudi crown prince ordered Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s assassination\n\nMnuchin may also attend the conference, said someone familiar with the planning, but was not included on the list of attendees obtained by The Post. A spokesman for Mnuchin did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn an email statement, a White House official said it was important for the administration to continue working with partners such as Saudi Arabia on a range of issues, including \u201cthe recent attack on the global economy\u201d \u2014 a reference to drone and missile attacks on Saudi oil facilities last weekend.\n\nKushner, the person familiar with his plans said, is appreciative that the Saudis sent a significant delegation to the Peace to Prosperity economic workshop that he helped organize in Bahrain in June as part of the administration\u2019s Middle East peace effort and is considering attending the Riyadh forum partly as a reciprocal gesture.\n\nKushner and the president have come under scrutiny for defending \u2014 and not punishing \u2014 the Saudi government, even as the crown prince and his emissaries offered contradictory and dishonest answers about Khashoggi\u2019s killing and the government\u2019s role in it.\n\nBut many Trump allies argue that Saudi Arabia is a close ally \u2014 Trump made the kingdom the first stop on his first foreign trip in 2017 \u2014 with whom the United States must continue to work. On Wednesday, for instance, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to meet with Mohammed and affirm U.S. support after the surprise attacks that devastated Saudi oil fields.\n\nKushner has maintained a close relationship with the crown prince, and his private communications with the Saudi leader on a messaging app have drawn scrutiny from Capitol Hill investigators and others in the Trump administration. Rex Tillerson, the former secretary of state, sometimes complained that he was kept out of the loop by Kushner on issues involving Saudi Arabia, former administration officials said.\n\nTwo princes: Kushner now faces a reckoning for Trump\u2019s bet on the heir to the Saudi throne\n\nTrump has downplayed Kushner\u2019s relationship with the kingdom.\n\n\u201cJared doesn\u2019t do business with Saudi Arabia. They\u2019re two young guys. Jared doesn\u2019t know him well or anything,\u201d the president told The Post last year. \u201cThey are just two young people. They are the same age.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials say that it makes sense to attend the conference because Saudi Arabia is a close ally \u2014 and a key trading partner on oil.\n\nOther expected attendees, according to a tentative list, are Tom Barrack, a longtime Trump friend; David Malpass, president of the World Bank; and Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican and former House majority leader who is now an executive at Moelis & Co.", "description": "Last year, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin withdrew from the forum amid controversy after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.", "authors": ["Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Ashley Parker", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J2TU4HC24YI6TIAOAUG4POBGSM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
