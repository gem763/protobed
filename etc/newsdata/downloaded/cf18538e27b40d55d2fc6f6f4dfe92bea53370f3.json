Five crew members, including the captain, jumped overboard and were rescued by a nearby good Samaritan vessel, officials said.\n\nThe 34 people killed in the disaster were apparently asleep in the lower deck of the three-deck boat, officials said. The flames apparently blocked a stairway leading to the upper decks and an escape hatch, trapping the victims, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said on Tuesday.\n\nChristian Monterrosa/AP\n\nThe ship sank and overturned in about 65 feet of water as firefighters battled the flames, Brown said.\n\nHomendy said a 16-member investigative team from the NTSB arrived on scene Tuesday morning. They're collecting evidence and expected to interview the crew, witnesses and first responders.\n\nNTSB investigations of such \"major marine casualty\" incidents typically take 12 to 24 months to complete, but the agency usually releases a preliminary report within 10 days of an incident, she added.\n\nBrown said the victims ranged in age from 17 to in their 60s. He said DNA collected from family members is being used to identify the victims.\n\nThe boat had been chartered by Truth Aquatics in Santa Barbara and was on the last day of a three-day diving adventure trip off the Channel Islands, Brown said.\n\nDominic Selga told ABC News that his mother, stepfather and three sisters were among those who died.\n\n\"Just thinking about that is difficult,\" Selga said. \"Being burned alive, burning while drowning, while inhaling smoke, that's insane.\"\n\nCapt. Monica Rochester of the U.S. Coast Guard said the boat was required to have smoke detectors, fixed firefighting equipment in the engine room and fire extinguishers throughout the vessel, including ones at the front and rear of the boat. She said that during the most recent inspection of the boat, all the required firefighting apparatus was accounted for.\n\nAndrew Cullen/New York Times via Redux\n\nRochester said it remains under investigation whether the smoke detectors were working at the time of the fire and if the crew attempted to use the firefighting equipment before abandoning ship.\n\nColleagues of the boat's skipper, Boylan, who has not yet spoken of the disaster, defended him as an extremely safety-conscious mariner.\n\n\"There's no better captain than Jerry. No one,\" Dana Fritzler, the wife of the owner of the Conception, Glen Fritzler, said in a statement to ABC affiliate station KEYT-TV in Santa Barbara. \"He kept everything on his boat immaculate and safe.\"\n\nIan Higgins, captain of the Conception's identical sister ship called the Vision, told ABC affiliate station KGTV in San Diego, that Boylan is a stickler for safety.\n\n\"He's so safety conscious about all the different aspects of the vessel,\" Higgins said of Boylan. \"He's about as stern as a mariner, as stern as a captain, as stern as an individual and safety conscious as an individual as one can be.\"", "description": "Investigators '100%' certain they will find cause of deadly dive-boat fire.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/santa-barbara-boat-fire-01-gty-jc-190904_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
