There are no American soldiers in the area,\" President Donald Trump said in a statement Wednesday. \"I made it clear that I did not want to fight these endless, senseless wars -- especially those that don't benefit the United States. Turkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place -- and we will hold them to this commitment.\"\n\nTurkish airstrikes hit the town of Ras al-Ayn on the Syrian side of the border, local activists said. Smoke could be seen rising from area. The Kurdish-led SDF said Turkish warplanes were hitting civilian areas with airstrikes, causing huge panic.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 15 people, including eight civilians, had been killed in the airstrikes. More than 40 other people had been wounded, according to the Britain-based monitoring group, which has a network of sources across Syria.", "description": "Turkey Begins Move Against Kurds in Northern Syria", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/10/2019101000592_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
