He wasn\u2019t the only one who lost out on money. The winner of the Puzzle & Dragons tournament did, too.\n\nJunior high school student Yuwa came in first place. The prize purse was 5,000,000 yen ($67,513) \u2014 none of which he received. Instead, he was given a trophy, a gaming headset, a year\u2019s supply of chocolate almonds, and a year\u2019s supply of Real Gold Dragon Boost energy drink.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t he get any money? According to Japan\u2019s pro-gaming licence system, players between the ages of 13 and 15 can only compete under a junior licence, which waves any right they have to receive prize money. Japan\u2019s pro-gaming organisation wants younger competitors to focus on their schoolwork. In Japan, compulsory education ends after junior high school.\n\nWhen Yuwa was awarded the trophy after the tournament, the announcer pointed out that because he had a junior licence, he would not get any of the prize money. \u201cAaah, that\u2019s too bad,\u201d said the other announcer. Both announcers remarked how they look forward to what he does from henceforth. Like, win this tournament again?\n\nLater, on Twitter, Yuwa wrote, \u201cI received honour instead of money.\u201d Admirable, but those winnings probably would have come in handy for college tuition.", "description": "During the Tokyo Game Show, legendary Street Fighter player Momochi forfeited tens of thousands of dollars in prize money because he doesn\u2019t have a pro-gaming licence in Japan.
