I\u2019m back to highlight three top dividend-growth stocks. As a quick reminder, I do this because businesses with consistently increasing dividend payouts\n\ncan guard against the harmful effects of inflation by providing a rising income stream; and\n\ntend to outperform the market averages over the long haul.\n\nThe three stocks below offer an average dividend yield of 4%. Thus, if you spread them out evenly in an average $250K RRSP account, the group will provide you with a growing $10,000 annual income stream. And it\u2019s all completely passive.\n\nThis week, we\u2019ll take a look at dividend stocks coming from the particularly attractive financial services space.\n\nBank on it Leading off our list is financial services giant Bank of Montreal (TSX:BMO)(NYSE:BMO), which has delivered steady dividend growth of 30% over the past five years.\n\nBMO\u2019s scale, comfy regulatory environment, and diversified nature continue to support steady payout increases. In the most recent quarter, adjusted EPS clocked in at $2.38 as revenue improved 5%. BMO\u2019s Canadian and U.S. personal and commercial banking businesses combined delivered 9% growth in pre-provision pre-tax profit.\n\nOur capital position remains strong at 11.4% and we are taking actions to continue to position our businesses for growth and sustainable long-term performance,\u201d said CEO Darryl White.\n\nBMO shares are down 8% over the past three months and currently offer a healthy dividend yield of 4.4%.\n\nKeep it intact With steady dividend growth of 55% over the past five years, property and casualty (P&C) insurance company Intact Financial (TSX:IFC) is next up on our list.\n\nAs Canada\u2019s largest P&C insurance company, Intact\u2019s scale advantages (close to $10 billion in annual premiums written), multi-channel distribution, and in-house claims expertise should continue to underpin its rising dividend. In Q2, EPS came in at $1.44 as revenue improved 8% to $3.2 billion.\n\nIntact ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of total capital margin.\n\n\u201cHard market conditions continue across the business allowing us to capture growth opportunities,\u201d said CEO Charles Brindamour.\n\nIntact is up 31% so far in 2019 and currently offers a decent dividend yield of 2.3%.\n\nImperial choice Rounding out our list is banking behemoth Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (TSX:CM)(NYSE:CM), which has increased its dividend 40% over the past five years.\n\nCIBC\u2019s long history of earnings and payout growth coupled with the recent sluggishness of its shares make it a particularly timely play. In the most recent quarter, adjusted earnings improved 4% as revenue grew to $4.7 billion.\n\n\u201cIn the third quarter, we delivered solid results through the continued execution of our client-focused strategy,\u201d said CEO Victor Dodig. \u201cOur diversified growth on both sides of the border is a result of a highly connected, purpose-led team working together to meet the needs of our clients.\u201d\n\nCIBC shares remain down about 8% over the past six months and currently offer a healthy dividend yield of 5.4%.\n\nThe bottom line There you have it, Fools: three solid dividend-growth stocks worth checking out.\n\nAs always, they aren\u2019t formal recommendations. They\u2019re simply a starting point for more research. The breaking of a dividend-growth streak can be especially painful, so plenty of due diligence is still required.\n\nFool on.\n\nFool contributor Brian Pacampara owns no position in any of the companies mentioned.
