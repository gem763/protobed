Honestly, what is so special about being \u201cengaged\u201d? Try yelling the word fianc\u00e9e. It\u2019s weird, right? Now try yelling boyfriend. Doesn\u2019t that feel good? Try yelling \u201cMY WIFE!\u201d OH! THE DRAMA! THE PASSION! THE INTRIGUE. Being able to yell \u201cmy wife\u201d in a crowded Crate & Barrel is the stuff we all dream of, but being the person who yells \u201cmy fianc\u00e9\u201d in a crowded Crate & Barrel? We get it, you\u2019re engaged.\n\nThis whole season of Bachelor in Paradise, especially the final third, was really bogged down by the unnatural fixation on being ENGAGED. C\u2019mon, y\u2019all. In an era when these dummies are literally hitting up anyone who has ever appeared on a dating reality show on their Google+ accounts, just getting someone to commit to being in an exclusive relationship is a huge accomplishment. In previous seasons, more couples would be going into the finale and a few would end up just deciding to get coffee in a city equidistant to both of them once the season was over. And that was nice! It captured that feeling of finding out your friend was dating a cool guy and they were putting each other in their profile pictures. \u201cAwww, Caroline and Jeff went apple picking! That\u2019s cute.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m over here wondering if Bachelor in Paradise just got addicted to being that show that produces marriages and children? After a season where its Bachelorette ended up in a meaningful relationship with Dancing With the Stars, the Bachelor Cinematic Universe didn\u2019t want to admit defeat. These assholes are getting engaged if we have to trap them on the beach and cut their Achilles tendons to get them to kneel.\n\nSo, what do we end up with? Bachelor in Paradise trying to generate a little intrigue and tension by letting Hannah speak without Dylan\u2019s tongue in her mouth, and convincing women to try to get engaged to men who are WOEFULLY inadequate. My God, Chris B. and Clay do not come off well in this episode.\n\nAlso, this bullshit did not need to be three hours long. We did not need a montage of every couple. We are aware. Let\u2019s get to it.\n\nThe episode starts off with the couples heading into the Fantasy Suites (read: a hotel suite down the street from the beach). Katie is heading into the Fantasy Suite not knowing if Chris \u2026 likes her? Or is capable of demonstrating love? Y\u2019all. Y\u2019all. The most Chris can muster is, \u201cI will not falter.\u201d Is he a soldier in the Civil War? Apparently, that\u2019s all Katie needs to hear to know that Chris is ready to be with her forever.\n\nIn between make-outs, Hannah and Dylan talk about how she\u2019s afraid to be hurt again. This is apparently their story line and the only attempt by ABC to create some suspense over whether these two extras from She\u2019s All That will get engaged. I didn\u2019t even take notes once they headed to the beach, since I knew it would be them taking a California-cool approach to an engagement. And your girl is never wrong.\n\nIs anyone suspicious about why we\u2019ve literally never heard the story of Demi and Kristian\u2019s relationship before Paradise? How did they meet? Why don\u2019t we know this? Listen, I\u2019m not saying that Kristian isn\u2019t a super-chill simulation designed to trick conservative Bachelor Nation fans into accepting queer people. But I\u2019m not not saying it.\n\nThe final Fantasy Suite is Nicole and Clay. Who didn\u2019t see this meltdown coming? Nicole fully expects to be engaged without Clay saying \u201cI love you,\u201d and Clay spent eight months in a committed relationship without saying \u201cI love you.\u201d But also, Nicole, why? Just why? If she spent more than 15 seconds thinking about Clay\u2019s history, it would reveal that he\u2019s probably the type of guy who loves feeling like the Big Man in a woman\u2019s life, but the idea of actually changing his life to let someone in terrifies him. It\u2019s much easier to just berate a woman into going to the gym with you and let her sit on your back while you do push-ups. Clay also seems to construct a version of his relationships in his head that don\u2019t match up with what the other person believes or what his actions are doing.\n\nI WILL SAY that Nicole seemed to be taking his gentle musings about the future as passionate admissions of his love for Nicole. Him saying, \u201cYeah, going to the movies together would be nice,\u201d probably isn\u2019t the precursor to a wedding proposal. Clay tries to be transparent, but he waits until the last minute and Nicole throws him out of the Fantasy Suite to give him space. She then watches a fireworks display that is clearly mocking her.\n\nIt\u2019s the next morning and it\u2019s time for these proposals. Clay and Nicole are first so they\u2019re definitely breaking up. That\u2019s how this works. She says she has no idea where Clay\u2019s head is at but she is also ready to get engaged. In what goddamned world. Clay says a perfectly reasonable thing at the worst possible time: that he wants to take things slow but he\u2019s not in love with her yet, and he\u2019s definitely not ready to get engaged. WHICH IS A COMPLETELY NORMAL THING TO FEEL ABOUT SOMEONE AFTER A MONTH. Listen, I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for years and we love each other very much. If he\u2019d proposed after a month, I would have run at Lake Michigan with such speed, my feet would have skipped off it like Road Runner. Nicole says she wants a love so deep the ocean gets jealous. Apparently, it\u2019s a Pablo Neruda quote, but when it\u2019s said on Paradise, it sounds like a Bruno Mars lyric. Nicole says she can\u2019t tell people that they\u2019re together if he doesn\u2019t love her back, and she bolts.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the other \u201chappy\u201d couples. Up first is Katie and Chris. Listen. We can\u2019t talk about Katie and Chris\u2019s engagement without talking about where they end up in the reunion. Katie. My dear, sweet Katie. You do not need to accept this. You do not need to accept a grown-ass man who is completely incapable of expressing a single adult feeling to you. This entire relationship Chris has been setting a bar that Katie has to meet and she\u2019s been rising to meet it, and apparently all he\u2019s been doing is saying that she has beautiful eyes. If the only thing your alleged fianc\u00e9 can say about you is that you have beautiful eyes, he\u2019s gotta work harder! The best nonphysical thing he can manage is \u201cgreat personality.\u201d Great personality is what you say when someone you don\u2019t know really well asks you to endorse them on LinkedIn. \u201cUh \u2026 public speaking and great personality? Five stars?\u201d\n\nThe thing that really set it off for me was the last line of Chris\u2019s proposal: \u201cTomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed, so let me make this the best moment of our life.\u201d That\u2019s what you say when you don\u2019t believe that you\u2019ll stay engaged but you wanna end on a high note. He also ends their segment by going, \u201cWho would have thunk?\u201d\n\nThen Dylan and Hannah get engaged because of course they did. Same with Demi and Kristian. The show telegraphs that it\u2019s totally okay with this by having the other engaged couples cheer for Demi and Kristian, and they get the final toast as they head into the finale. I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: I\u2019m very happy for Demi and Kristian, but the show has off-loaded any and all work to actually create a queer story line to an outside figure and wants to appear totally progressive for it. A universe exists where other queer people are brought on the show to be viable options for Demi (or another queer contestant) and we watch their courtship, and I want to live in that universe, too.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the reunion and \u2014 THERE ARE TWO MORE HOURS OF THIS SHIT? Okay. We gotta bullet-point some of this:\n\n\u2022 JPJ completely refuses to apologize to Derek and continues to insinuate that Derek is some sort of podcast Lothario, when no woman ever has slept with a man because of his podcast.\n\n\u2022 Tahzjuan reminds us that she has no idea what a metaphor is when she calls Haley a pigeon.\n\n\u2022 Jordan and Christian still think that this fight makes them look masculine and very sexually attractive and try to get into another fight over an apology handshake. Jordan takes the same tactic as JPJ and says he\u2019s sorry something happened but that Christian basically deserved it.\n\n\u2022 Tayshia and Hannah accuse each other of \u201cMean Girl\u2013ing\u201d each other because of Blake\u2019s trip to Birmingham, which was apparently totally platonic.\n\n\u2022 Cam is annoyed that everyone talked before the season, and Tahzjuan says that he tried to get an invite to her birthday party, which is the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\n\u2022 Connor is still dating Whitney, and Caelynn is deluding herself that sleeping in a van with no shower is the relationship she wants.\n\n\u2022 Dylan and Hannah are still together.\n\n\u2022 Kristian re-proposes to Demi.\n\n\u2022 Tayshia flew to \u201cthe town that fooled the British,\u201d whatever the fuck that means, to tell JPJ that she made a mistake, and he asks her to be his girlfriend. Someone explain this to me.\n\n\u2022 A segment between Clay and Nicole was apparently cut out, according to Twitter.\n\nNow, it\u2019s time for the folks in the Hot Seat. First up is Blake, because his life can\u2019t get any worse! The main topic of conversation is Blake releasing his text messages with Caelynn. The most baffling thing is that Blake seems genuinely surprised that people? Would have? Feelings? And he would be responsible? For those feelings? He can totally see why people would be mad at him, though. Okay. That\u2019s not the same thing as an apology or accountability. When it comes to the text messages, he says that he HAD to defend himself because God forbid someone have a negative feeling about the golden boy of Bachelor Nation. He says he knew people would react to Caelynn but he had no idea that the internet would attack a woman\u2019s sexuality. Has he been to the internet?\n\nBlake is letting himself occupy a very light-gray area where he can say that he knew there would be a reaction, but not a reaction like that. He can say he knew that Kristina and Caelynn would have feelings about him sleeping with both of them, but not feelings like that. He wants credit for being proactive but not about anything that actually matters. He says that no one would know that Caelynn was also at fault unless he did what he did. WOW. YIKES. OKAY. Thank you, Batman. He ends up apologizing that Caelynn feels the way she does \u2026 and that\u2019s it.\n\nKatie comes out wearing an amazing dress that I want for a wedding I\u2019m going to this October. Katie says that she still loves Chris, she isn\u2019t wearing her wedding ring, that he doesn\u2019t fill her tank up with affection, and he mostly tells other people how much he loves her but doesn\u2019t tell her. Also, she wanted to watch the season hoping to see how much he loved her, since he doesn\u2019t express it to her, but instead she saw \u2026 whatever he did all season. Katie says that he\u2019s a man of his word but hasn\u2019t reciprocated her words or done nearly anything to make her feel good and validated. So what fucking value does this man and his word have? She sees that there is so much potential for them but it hasn\u2019t come to fruition. This dude is in his 30s. Ain\u2019t no more potential; he\u2019s fully baked. What is happening in our society that a woman that everyone agrees is super kind and caring is torturing herself over the potential that a white man will one day be affectionate toward her, HIS FIANC\u00c9E? She literally says, \u201cI\u2019ve come to a darkness.\u201d\n\nYou better run girl.\n\nInstead, Chris comes out and says that no relationship is easy and that he wants to give everything she gives him back to her. He could just do that. He could realize that his fianc\u00e9e is unhappy and he has to commit to change and then turn that commitment into action. He says he didn\u2019t expect all this. Oh \u2026 oh, no. So he doesn\u2019t know her or her feelings \u2026 at all. He tells her that she\u2019s beautiful and he doesn\u2019t want her to feel that way. If only he had some way to affect her feelings about their relationship \u2026\n\nThey both agree they want to keep trying despite zero evidence that he understands how this whole relationship thing works. Katie puts her ring back on, but in the parking lot, Chris throws a mini-fit that Katie blindsided him. It\u2019s more embarrassing that you were blindsided about your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s feelings than it is that she blindsided you.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s time for the reveal of the next Bachelor and it\u2019s Peter because he\u2019s the only one not dating an actual celebrity! He looks 12 without any facial hair! It\u2019s the most boring choice possible!
