Then the ribs are brushed with spicy honey, and broiled for 2 minutes to caramelize. Don\u2019t worry that the ribs go into the slow cooker without liquid; the heat is gentle enough that the ribs do not burn, and the meat releases liquid as it cooks, so it braises in its own spiced juices. (You could also make these ribs in a pressure cooker by following this recipe.) One thing to note: Red chiles taste best in this recipe because green chiles are less sweet and can taste grassy. Any spicy red chile will work beautifully, and red-pepper flakes work in a pinch. If you prefer green chiles, however, you can use them.", "description": "These simple, snackable ribs are slow cooked until they are very tender Then the ribs are brushed with spicy honey, and broiled for 2 minutes to caramelize Don\u2019t worry that the ribs go into the slow cooker without liquid; the heat is gentle enough that the ribs do not burn, and the meat releases liquid as it cooks, so it braises in its own spiced juices", "authors": ["Sarah Digregorio", "Alison Roman", "Yossy Arefi", "Erin Jeanne Mcdowell", "Melissa Clark", "David Tanis", "Colu Henry", "Margaux Laskey", "Joan Nathan", "Martha Rose Shulman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/dining/sd-slow-cooker-hot-honey-ribs/sd-slow-cooker-hot-honey-ribs-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
