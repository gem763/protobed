It\u2019s a stirring clarion call, a rousing siren song, a virtuoso performance that puts even the Rolling Stone 100 Best Singers to shame.\n\nIt\u2019s also awkward as heck, and has led to a bumper crop of memes, ringtones, and remixes. Ariana Grande covered it, and Lizzo gave it a live flute-y twist. It\u2019s only a matter of time until Kelly Clarkson covers it on Kellyoke. The buck stops here, though. No longer are carpetbagging memesters going to profit off the hard work and creative labor of a musical artist. Kylie Jenner is a mother first, a vocalist second, but lest we forget, she\u2019s a billionaire third. On Tuesday, TMZ reported that Jenner filed legal documents to trademark \u201cthe slang version of the famous wake up call,\u201d which would cover cosmetics as well as \u201cbelts, pants, coats, dresses, footwear, gloves, headbands, headwear, jackets, loungewear, scarves, sleepwear, socks, swimwear and undergarments.\u201d\n\nJenner already sold out of $65 Rise and Shine hoodies online, so clearly the demand is there. Jenner\u2019s trademark filing comes right after the news that, just days after being posted on October 16, the #RiseandShine hashtag became the fastest ever to hit a billion views on TikTok. Luckily, the filing said nothing about Halloween costumes, though. So you can still do your DIY Stormi and Kylie \u201cRise and Shine\u201d couples costume without paying royalties.", "description": "The Kylie Jenner Stormi Rise and Shine video has become a viral meme with over a billion TikTok views on the hashtag.
