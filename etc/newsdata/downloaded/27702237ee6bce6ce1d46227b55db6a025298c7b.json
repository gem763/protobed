(AP) - A person familiar with the move confirms to The Associated Press that the Buffalo Bills have agreed to trade receiver Zay Jones to the Oakland Raiders.\n\nBuffalo will acquire a fifth-round pick in the 2021 draft, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity on Monday because the trade has not been announced. ESPN.com first reported the deal.\n\nThe trade comes after Jones was limited to playing just one snap in a 14-7 win at Tennessee on Sunday. Rookie Duke Williams took over Jones\u2019 role as the No. 3 receiver and scored the decisive touchdown on a 7-yard catch in the fourth quarter, a day after being promoted from the practice squad.\n\nJones\u2019 benching came a week after he was faulted for not helping break up one of three interceptions thrown by Josh Allen in a 16-10 loss to New England.\n\nJones was selected by the Bills in the second round of the 2017 draft out Stephen F. Austin. After an inconsistent rookie season, he led Buffalo with 56 catches, 652 yards and seven touchdowns last season.\n\nHe\u2019s managed just seven catches for 69 yards this year.\n\nThe trade was made as both teams enter their bye weeks.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A person familiar with the move confirms to The Associated Press that the Buffalo Bills have agreed to trade receiver Zay Jones to the Oakland Raiders.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Wawrow"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
