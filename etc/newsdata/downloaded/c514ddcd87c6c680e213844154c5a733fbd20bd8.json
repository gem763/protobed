It was not immediately clear whether anyone was killed. Five people were taken to Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare for treatment.\n\nInterim Police Chief Steve Outlaw said at a news conference \"you can't help but wonder\" whether the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks was a factor in the attack, but police found no evidence of any connections. He said police had not determined a motive for the \"spontaneous\" attack.\n\nHe said co-workers fought off the knife-wielding attacker with objects in the office.\n\nChief Outlaw noted Brown had run-ins with law enforcement years ago. A Florida Department of Corrections offender website shows the 41-year-old spent time in prison for drug dealing and grand theft in cases going back to 1996. He was released from prison in July 2009.\n\nPolice arrive on the scene of a stabbing that injured multiple victims in Tallahassee, Florida, on Sept. 11. More\n\nFrantic family members gathered behind police tape and shared stories of the horror that unfolded inside the business.\n\nMarquitta Campbell's husband, Bobby Riggins Jr., arrived for a job interview at Dyke Industries at around 8:30 a.m. She said she was on the phone with him when she heard a commotion.\n\n\u201cThe next thing I know, he said, \u2018Baby, I\u2019ve been stabbed five times,\u2019 \u201d Campbell said as she waited for answers.\n\nHer husband later called her from the hospital to tell her he had internal bleeding and was going into surgery.\n\nDanielle Buchanan, a spokeswoman for Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare, said, \"One patient is in serious condition; two patients are in fair condition; and two patients are in good condition.\"\n\nEllen Mospens said her husband, Dennis McMaster, escaped without injury. He texted her to say there had been a \u201cmassive stabbing\u201d at the business. \u201cCome get me,\u201d he said.\n\nWrestling belt: Tallahassee police recover Chris Jericho championship wrestling belt, but mystery remains\n\nBefore the stabbing, city officials were grappling with a rash of shootings over the weekend that left two dead and one injured.\n\nDyke Industries, based in Little Rock, Arkansas, has 15 distribution outlets in 18 states and provides residential and commercial building materials, including interior and exterior doors, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\nFollow Karl Etters on Twitter: @KarlEtters\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tallahassee Democrat: Tallahassee stabbing: Antwann Brown named as attacker; 5 stabbed", "description": "A hospital treated five people from a stabbing at Dyke Industries in Tallahassee, Florida.
