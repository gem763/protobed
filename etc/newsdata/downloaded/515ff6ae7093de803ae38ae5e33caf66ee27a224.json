Disney got their feet wet with the debut of the Deluxe Disney Princess Enchanted Collection, curated for the Princess-loving kids, back in November. Their newest subscription box offering, the Disney Backstage Collection, is for the Disney-loving adult; those who appreciate the history and the legacy of Walt Disney Studios.\n\nPersonally, I'm a huge subscription-box aficionado. Not only have I subscribed to many of them \u2014 from Play! By Sephora to Robb Vices\u2014 I was once part of a luxury subscription box startup. It's a retail experience I appreciate and one that I love. It's such a delightful thing to receive a carefully curated box of goods at your doorstep. Additionally, the element of surprise is irresistible; it's like having a birthday every month. Since I also happen to be a gigantic Disney fan, the Disney Backstage Collection box is right up my alley.\n\nWhat is the Disney Backstage Collection?\n\nThe new Disney Backstage Collection, which debuted in early September, is delivered every month and includes a variety of items for those who aren't afraid to show their love for all things Disney. Each item in the package pays tribute to the history of the Walt Disney Company and includes a limited-edition T-shirt, a limited-edition collectible pin, and other items presented in a unique canister.\n\nThe creators of the subscription box work closely with Imagineers and the Walt Disney studio archives to create each of the items using vintage art and assets as inspiration.\n\nWhat the first release includes\n\nThe first release from the Disney Backstage Collection goes way back to 1923, the very beginning of the Walt Disney Company, when it was called Disney Bros Studios (for Walt and Roy Disney). Their tiny office, which only had room for a desk for Roy, was located on Kingswell Avenue in Hollywood. The logo used on the items in the box were culled from their old stationery.\n\nSunny Chanel / Business Insider\n\nThe vintage Disney Bros Studio logo is featured on the T-shirt in the box, which has a couple of added details. The inside collar of the shirt features a quote from Walt Disney. On the sleeve, there's a patch with 4649, which was the building number for their studio on Kingswell.\n\nAlong with the T-shirt, subscribers receive a Disney pin. This particular one is fashioned after a window with the Disney Bros Studio logo, a clever and old-school design. To clue you into all the fun details of each design, the box also includes a behind-the-scenes story card.\n\nAll of this is delivered in a sturdy souvenir canister that features illustrations from the vault. In this case, it includes very old renderings of Mickey Mouse (who doesn't look at all like the Mickey we know today).\n\nWhat to expect from future boxes\n\nWhile Disney is keeping the themes of upcoming shipments secret, we do know that the future boxes will include items inspired by the archives of Walt Disney Animation Studios, Disney Parks, and Pixar. The current welcome package, with the Disney Bros Studios items, will be available for six months, after which it will be retired, and a new one will be released.\n\nThe pricing\n\nThere are three monthly subscription tiers you can sign up for: three months ($39.99 per month), six months ($37.99 per month), and one year ($34.99 per month).\n\nWhen you sign up, you are given the choice of T-shirt size (from small to 2XL), and there's also an option if you'd like to give the box as a gift.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWhether you're gifting it to a friend or just treating yourself to something fun, the Disney Backstage Collection is a great way to celebrate the studio that means so much to Disney fans. The element of surprise, with each shipment being a mystery, brings a bit of magic to your (or their) doorstep every month.", "description": "The Disney Backstage Collection pays homage to its iconic history.\u00a0Each box includes a limited edition t-shirt, collectible pin, and other surprises.", "authors": ["Sunny Chanel"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7949e42e22af0216718183-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
