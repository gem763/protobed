Hot seat rankings: Which managers are facing sack? 1/21 Hot seat rankings Which Premier League managers are facing the sack? Getty 2/21 20. Jurgen Klopp Preventing the adoration of the Kop inadvertantly beaming him directly up to heaven, Klopp will not be departing Anfield anytime soon. Getty 3/21 19. Pep Guardiola The best manager in the world, personal friends with the board, the only way Pep departs will be out of his own choosing. That won't come before the end of this season AFP/Getty Images 4/21 18. Brendan Rodgers Amid an initial circus of doubters, Rodgers has revived Leicester's vein of title-winning form. The Foxes have taken five wins from their first eight games, James Maddison has become one of the league's outstanding creative players and Caglar Soyuncu is testing his wares as Tukey's Matthijs de Ligt. All smiles for Brendan. Getty 5/21 17. Eddie Howe Howe is as much a part of Bournemouth's furniture as the run-down fairground. His side have started in mixed form, creeping into the top half of the table, and it's hard to ever imagine Howe departing unless the likes of an Everton or Tottenham come in for him. Getty 6/21 16. Frank Lampard Under enforced conditions, Lampard has reignited a rare sense of positivity at Stamford Bridge. Tammy Abraham, Fikayo Tomori, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Reece James have all broken through, results are continually improving and there'll be a long degree of leniency for a hometown manger operating under such restraints. Getty 7/21 15. Sean Dyche Like a fine claret, Burnley's success comes in cycles and, after Europa League qualification and the drear season which followed, Dyche's side are undefeated since August, Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes are firing, and the manager's seven-year stay has a long time to run. AFP/Getty 8/21 14. Nuno Espirito Santo It's been a tale of mixed fortunes for Santo. They're primed for Europa League knockout qualification and rocked Manchester City at the Etihad, but the wider picture is blearier with only two wins out of eight thus far. PA 9/21 13. Chris Wilder The sturdiest of the newly promoted clubs, Wilder has countered a lack of resources with invention and a frugal defence. Up front, the goals aren't plentiful, but they are grinding out results so far. PA 10/21 12. Graham Potter The perfect partner to Dan Ashworth's technical revolution, the bedding-in period was slightly topsy-turvy, but with Lewis Dunk towering at the heart of a back-five and a host of talent in attack, the ceiling is high for Potter. Getty 11/21 11. Unai Emery Arsenal are only ever one bad result away from implosion but, thus far, the wheels have just about stayed with a series of not-altogether-spectacular wins that have propelled the club into third. But with the manager\u2019s vision, even at this stage still misty, a downward spiral will quickly incite the disgruntled Emirates. Reuters 12/21 10. Manuel Pellegrini For West Ham, disaster never feels too far away. At the moment, though, they sit relatively pretty in eighth - but with only 12 points from their eight games. Sebastian Haller is impressing up front, Andriy Yarmolenko is in fine form, but there\u2019s still not a total cohesion. The strength in the squad is there, but if results are to take a nosedive, it wouldn\u2019t be a shock to see Gold and Sullivan try their hand. Getty 13/21 9. Roy Hodgson The revival continues. Roy Hodgson entered the season as the old face ready to meet the axe of time. Instead, the 72-year-old has defied the grandfather clock, soaring to sixth in the table with three wins in their last four. There is of course an instability seeping from the dressing-room as Wilfried Zaha wrangles over his future and the club have only managed eight goals in as many games. Those are warning signs that fortune can swing quickly but, for now, Hodgson lives on. Getty Images 14/21 8. Daniel Farke The Canaries started with a wild chirp of victory, inflicting defeat on Newcastle and Manchester City, but a meek tweeting has followed. A fourth successive defeat - a thumping 5-1 loss at the hands of Aston Villa - confirmed that Daniel Farke\u2019s side have lost their spark and lack the defensive rigidity to back up their positive play. He too has bought himself a length of safety, but the trajectory soon needs to change from this downward flight. Getty 15/21 7. Dean Smith It\u2019s a top-six drop-off and it feels harsh to wedge Dean Smith\u2019s new-signing littered side into a grey area. Flaws in defence are evident and four defeats in eight games leave them sitting in 15th, but the groundwork is there, the additions of Trezeguet and Moraes, plus the form of John McGinn, means there\u2019s few reasons to fear for now. AFP/Getty Images 16/21 6. Quique Sanchez Flores He\u2019s only just arrived, but the plight feels familiar. Other than a valiant fightback against Arsenal, the atmosphere feels relatively bleak. Of course, Flores\u2019 recent return will buy him time, but rooted to the bottom of the table without a win, Watford's notoriously trigger-happy hierarchy won't be shy. EPA 17/21 5. Steve Bruce Steve Bruce, the valiant centurion of the old guard, was swamped by trouble until Matty Longstaff downed Manchester United and smothered the club in good sibling feeling. It\u2019s not blunt to say that Newcastle\u2019s fans don\u2019t like Bruce. Yet, with the club stuck in an indefinite wobble as tiresome takeover talks continue, there will be little desire to provoke further instability. Slowly, steadily, Bruce\u2019s team are starting to gel. If he can get Andy Carroll to revive the type of form consigned to a pre-4g era, he could survive once again. EPA 18/21 4. Ralph Hasenhuttl The Austrian Klopp arrived, but Hasenhutl hasn\u2019t yet delivered. Three consecutive defeats, a flailing defence and lack of cohesion in attack. After a 4-1 defeat against Chelsea, he told his players to \u201cbe honest\u201d with themselves and demanded more commitment. His quality will extend his lifeline, but his vision is yet to translate with his players and, in 17th place, the hands of fate can quickly start to turn. Reuters 19/21 3. Mauricio Pochettino Mauricio Pochettino huffed and puffed with a threadbare squad to top-four finishes and a Champions League final, but now Spurs\u2019 brand-spanking new house is falling down. The symptoms and hangover were embedded in the summer, the outbreaks with defeat to Colchester, then the 7-2 thrashing by Bayern and a hopeless 3-0 defeat to Brighton. The squad are speaking publicly of a crisis, privately of being tired by the Argentine\u2019s regime, and a raft of key players already have one foot out the exit door. They all need a lift and, with Pochettino's own demeanour seeming exhausted, it\u2019s usually the manager's head that's first to topple. EPA 20/21 2. Marco Silva The question is barely whether Everton want to keep Marco Silva anymore. Instead, it\u2019s can the club find a better replacement, and how fast. The Spaniard\u2019s side sit in 18th, having taken seven points from their last eight games, despite Marcel Brands\u2019 astute investment in the summer. When the manager\u2019s agent starts making public statements, you know the vultures are circling above Goodison Park. PA 21/21 1. Ole Gunner Solskjaer If Old Trafford feels like a morgue, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has the uncomfortable air of a walking corpse. Reports are already circulating that a humbling defeat to Liverpool following the international break could signal the final curtain. His side have scored just 7 goals in their last 10 games, taken 17 points from 17 league games and haven\u2019t won on away soil since March. Add to that a outwardly flat dressing room and the end feels inevitable. Getty Images 1/21 Hot seat rankings Which Premier League managers are facing the sack? Getty 2/21 20.
