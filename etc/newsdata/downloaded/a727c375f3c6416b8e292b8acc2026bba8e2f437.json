NPR Wants To Hear Your Story\n\nEnlarge this image NPR NPR\n\nAnxiety is a natural part of growing up, but it can be hard for parents to know when a child's worries are appropriate and when something bigger is going on.\n\nToo much anxiety can hold children back, experts say, and it can leave parents feeling confused and anxious themselves. For example, some children are so afraid of the dark that they won't sleep alone, so bothered by dogs that they'll skip a play date, or so nervous about school that they simply refuse to go.\n\nNPR's Life Kit wants to hear your stories \u2014 and questions \u2014 and about your child's anxious behavior and how you've tried to handle it.\n\nJust fill out the form at this link.\n\nIf we end up using your story in the podcast, you'll get guidance from experts who've dedicated their careers to studying anxiety in children. You do not have to share your child's name.\n\nPart of this project involves putting voices on air, so we'd love it if you could send us a voice memo. You can submit a voice memo within the form.
