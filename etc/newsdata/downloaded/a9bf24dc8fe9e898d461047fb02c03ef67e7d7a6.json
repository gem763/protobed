Dozens of US border agents stood behind a gate topped with razor wire, which blocked the path into the US.\n\nSome migrants said they were trying to cross as a group into the US, and were frustrated that court dates kept being pushed backwards, leaving them uncertain of how long they would be stuck in Mexico.\n\n191009140350939\n\n\"We want to argue to cross over - we didn't ask to be in Mexico, they sent us here unjustly,\" said a man who declined to give his name. He said he had a court date in the US.\n\nMatamoros mayor Mario Lopez and a Mexican migration official pleaded with asylum seekers to clear the blockage.\n\nA Honduran man responded by indicating the lumps and rash on the throat of his young daughter, which he attributed to unhygienic conditions in the camp.\n\nHe said Mexican officials encouraged those in the camp to take a government-funded bus back to the border with Guatemala, instead of pursuing their US asylum claims. He said this was not a safe option for his family.\n\n\"I'd have to go back to Honduras. And you know the news there. If we go back to Honduras, in one day, in 24 hours, we're dead.\"\n\nTens of thousands of Hondurans have fled gang violence and criminality in the country, whose murder rate ranks among the world's highest.\n\nElias Rodriguez, public affairs liaison for US Customs and Border Protection in Brownsville, wrote in a statement that traffic on the Gateway Bridge between the two cities remained closed in both directions and that Thursday's MPP immigration court hearings were being rescheduled.\n\nRodriguez separately told Reuters there had been no violence.\n\n190927221616769\n\nMore than 51,000 migrants, mostly asylum seekers, have been returned to Mexico under MPP. At least 8,000 have been sent to Matamoros, a border city in crime-wracked Taumaulipas state, since the policy was expanded in July from other parts of the US-Mexico border.\n\nTheir sense of uncertainty comes amid news of shifting US policies. The US Supreme Court issued a decision last month that would allow the US government to deny asylum to people who have passed through a third country, such as Mexico, and not requested refuge there first.", "description": "Many of those on the bridge are awaiting court dates for hearings scheduled for weeks or months later in the US.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/10/209f153cb712477da766868efb4e5dd1_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
