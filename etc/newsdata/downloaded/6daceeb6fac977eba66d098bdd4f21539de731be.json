Gantz is due to speak at 2pm (1200 BST).\n\nIsrael election deadlock: what happens next? Read more\n\nThe change of strategy reflected the weakened position of Netanyahu, who heads the rightwing Likud party, after he failed again in Tuesday\u2019s election \u2013 which followed an inconclusive ballot in April \u2013 to secure a parliamentary majority.\n\nNetanyahu said: \u201cDuring the election campaign, I called for the establishment of a rightwing government but to my regret, the election results show that this is impossible.\n\n\u201cBenny, we must set up a broad unity government, as soon as today. The nation expects us, both of us, to demonstrate responsibility and that we pursue cooperation.\u201d\n\nLikud lawmaker David Bitan told Israeli Army Radio: \u201cEveryone will need to get off their high horse to prevent elections for the third time. Blue and White\u2019s desire for a unity government under their terms will not work.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Gantz said he hoped for a \u201cgood, desirable unity government\u201d. But he has also ruled out forming one with a Netanyahu-led Likud, citing looming corruption charges against the prime minister. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.\n\nMany Israelis hoped the poll would provide clarity and pull the nation out of a political crisis. But the muddy results that trickled in on Wednesday appeared to deadlock the country instead.\n\nWith nearly all votes counted on Thursday, the Blue and White party stood at 33 seats in Israel\u2019s 120-seat parliament, and Likud at 31 seats.\n\nNetanyahu, is not only fighting for his political life but also potentially his freedom, with pre-trial hearings for three corruption cases against him opening in just two weeks. A majority in the 120-seat parliament could help grant the 69-year-old immunity from prosecution.\n\nQuick guide The police investigations swirling around Netanyahu Show Hide The Israeli PM is embroiled in four cases involving allegations of bribery and misconduct. He denies wrongdoing in every instance. Case 1000 is an investigation into gifts received on a regular basis by Netanyahu and his family from two wealthy businessmen, including cigars and pink champagne. Case 2000 is examining whether Netanyahu behaved improperly during a taped conversation with a newspaper publisher in which he appeared to try to negotiate more sympathetic coverage in return for lowering the circulation of a rival paper. Case 3000 is an inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a deal to buy German submarines. Netanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal and the case has ensnared members of his inner circle.\n\nCase 4000, the most serious, involves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms company Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday evening, Netanyahu insisted his party and its rightwing allies had chosen him to remain leader, even as it was unclear how he would form a government. \u201cWe decided unanimously that we\u2019re going forward together to negotiations that will establish a government led by me,\u201d he said.\n\nLate on Wednesday, he cancelled a trip to the UN general assembly next week, in order to deal with the political crisis at home.\n\nGantz, a former general, has looked to centre and leftwing parties. But even those deals fall short of a parliamentary majority of 61 seats.\n\nIn the middle stands Israel\u2019s seeming kingmaker and staunch secularist, Avigdor Lieberman, who has called for a secular unity government of Likud, Blue and White, and his own party, the rightwing nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu (Israel Our Home).\n\nReuters and Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Spokeswoman for former general has no immediate response to PM\u2019s surprise offer", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes", "Raja Shehadeh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0883f10a11ac5e81e0c143ee790b95a6be85f412/634_422_6073_3644/master/6073.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fa82c97841ff964e261bb7b3733f1b17", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
