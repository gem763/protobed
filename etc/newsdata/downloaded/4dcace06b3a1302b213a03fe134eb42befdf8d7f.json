Taylor has potential to be among our biggest sport stars. Finally he\u2019s getting the platform to show why.\n\nJosh Taylor fights Regis Prograis for the Muhammad Ali Trophy at the 02 Arena on Saturday\n\nTHE OX\n\nIt can\u2019t be overstated just how big Liverpool\u2019s win over Genk was for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on Wednesday. This was the latest boost his career needed after injury woe. He could be a vital asset for club and country over the next 12 months.\n\nEDDIE JONES\n\nThis week showed why the RFU put their trust in Eddie Jones. He was hired for games like Saturday's World Cup semi-final against New Zealand and he has again been in his element. The mind games have been relentless since England beat Australia and his call to change a winning XV showed he is prepared to go all-in when the stakes are high.\n\nEddie Jones has attempted every mind game in the book ahead of clash with New Zealand\n\nNOT\n\nZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIC\n\nAfter LA Galaxy\u2019s defeat by LA FC in what could be his last match in MLS, the striker grabbed his crotch in response to taunts by fans. \u2018If I don\u2019t stay, nobody will remember what MLS is,\u2019 he said. You do wonder if the self-proclaimed lion, 38, will ever grow up.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic grabbed his crotch in response to taunts from fans after LA Galaxy defeat\n\nLEWIS HAMILTON\n\nIn the week Lewis Hamilton could seal a sixth world championship, it is what he does and says away from the track that is making news. Fernando Alonso accused him of hypocrisy over his call to save the planet and, with \u2018a lot going on\u2019 in his life Hamilton can only hope to have the final say at the wheel.\n\nFIFA\n\nThe Premier League is planning to play matches nine days before the start of the 2022 World Cup and eight days after the final. It\u2019s the latest evidence showing why playing it in winter is a bad idea and why giving it to Qatar wasn\u2019t clever, either. But of course we knew all that.", "description": "It's Hot or Not time again as Sportsmail's Daniel Matthews reveals what's been making him feel warm and what's been leaving him cold this week...", "authors": ["Daniel Matthews For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/21/20196860-0-image-a-15_1572034938119.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
