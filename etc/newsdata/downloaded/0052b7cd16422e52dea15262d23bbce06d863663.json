REUTERS/Neil Hall/Files\n\nAutocatalyst metal palladium however rallied to another record high, with expectations for a deficit this year helping it to breach the $1,700 an ounce level for the first time.\n\nSpot gold fell 0.4% to $1,490 per ounce at 0743 GMT, after prices hit $1,486.60 in the previous session, their lowest since Sept. 18. U.S. gold futures dipped 0.6% to $1,496.60 per ounce.\n\nThe dollar index held near its highest in a week.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, investors are sliding towards a dollar-denominated safe-haven appeal,\u201d said AxiTrader market strategist Stephen Innes.\n\nEuropean and Asian stock markets, including China\u2019s, were little changed on Monday, shrugging off news that the U.S. administration is considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nThe White House is not contemplating such a move at this time, Bloomberg quoted Treasury spokeswoman Monica Crowley as saying on Saturday, after Reuters reported on Friday the U.S. administration was considering the measure.\n\n\u201cGold remains on the uptrend for the long term but in the short term, there is some confusion considering the contradicting headlines we are getting on the trade war,\u201d Innes added.\n\nAhead of trade talks with the United States, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Sunday the two major economies would resolve their trade dispute \u201cwith a calm and rational attitude\u201d.\n\nInvestors were also awaiting clues on U.S. interest rate policy. Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker said on Friday he opposed the central bank\u2019s September rate cut and thinks it should \u201chold firm\u201d on interest rates.\n\nHigher interest rates tend to reduce investor interest in non-yielding bullion.\n\n\u201cA less dovish than expected Fed means the rally on gold prices may be capped, but in the near term, the upward momentum appears intact,\u201d said Howie Lee, economist at OCBC Bank.\n\nHoldings of the world\u2019s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust, fell 0.22% to 922.88 tonnes on Friday.\n\nSpeculators raised their bullish positions in COMEX gold and reduced bullish bets on silver contracts in the week to Sept. 24, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.\n\nElsewhere, palladium rose 0.8% to $1,694.85 per ounce, after hitting a record high at $1,700.71 earlier in the session.\n\nSilver dropped over 1% to $17.33 per ounce and platinum was down nearly 1% to $929.77 per ounce.", "description": "Gold fell on Monday as uncertainties around the U.S.-China trade war drove some investors to the safety of the dollar, pressuring assets priced in the U.S. currency.", "authors": ["Diptendu Lahiri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435406561&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T05S", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
