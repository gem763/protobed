There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens.\n\nDemocrats were hoping to determine if Yovanovitch's removal was related to a pressure campaign, or particularly, her unwillingness to take part.\n\nA former diplomat who spoke to Yovanovitch shortly after she was removed from her post told the Associated Press on Friday that Yovanovitch had refused to participate in \"all this offline, personal, informal stuff\" and had made clear to those pushing for investigations that the US government had formal ways to request them.\n\nYovanovitch, according to a copy of her opening statement, said she had been told by a senior State Department official about \"a concerted campaign against me\".\n\nThe official had told her that the president had pushed for her removal since the middle of last year, even though the department believed \"I had done nothing wrong\", she said in the the prepared statement .\n\nYovanovitch also expressed alarm over damage to American diplomacy under Trump and warned about \"private interests\" circumventing \"professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good\".\n\nTrump has maintained he did nothing wrong in his dealings with Ukraine and has labelled the impeachment probe \"garbage\".\n\n'Campaign' for removal\n\nIn the months leading up to Yovanovitch's removal, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his associates aided in an apparent campaign to have her recalled.\n\nGiuliani had accused Yovanovitch of blocking efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. The former mayor also provided information to both Trump and the State Department about Yovanovitch, who he suggested was biased against the president.\n\nOn Friday, Giuliani said he took those actions \"in my role as a defence lawyer\" for Trump.\n\nA day earlier, US prosecutors arrested two Florida businessmen tied to Giuliani, charging them with campaign finance violations.\n\nAccording to an indictment, the businessmen had lobbied a US congressman in 2018 for help ousting Yovanovitch. The indictment also alleges that the men leveraged a flurry of GOP political donations to force Yovanovitch's removal, an effort prosecutors say was aided by laundered foreign money.\n\nIn her statement, Yovanovitch said she did not know Giuliani's motives for attacking her but that his associates \"may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine\".\n\nCareer diplomat\n\nYovanovitch is a career diplomat who previously served as a US ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and Armenia. She has remained on the State Department payroll as a fellow at Georgetown University since she was recalled.\n\nDuring Trump's July 25 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which has been at the centre of the impeachment probe, the US president said Yovanovitch \"was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news\".\n\nZelensky agreed with Trump that she was a \"bad ambassador\".\n\nThe conversation occurred after Trump had withheld nearly $400m in congressionally approved security aid to Ukraine.\n\nUS President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani pushed for removal of Yovanovitch. [File: Aram Roston/Reuters]\n\nOn Thursday, 10 Democratic senators sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo demanding an explanation for Yovanovitch's removal before the end of her three-year assignment.\n\n\"In particular, her early recall raises questions about whether you put the personal interests of the president above the department's career personnel or US foreign policy,\" they wrote.", "description": "Marie Yovanovitch appears for closed-door deposition in the House, despite State Department directing her to not show.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/11/5dd076b9aad147a29bfc65aa1626598b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
