Sexton is a syndicated talk-radio host, and his Pluto TV show appears to be a video version. Kelly is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and former congressional candidate in Arizona who also hosts a podcast.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter reported on Tuesday that Viacom, controlled by Shari Redstone, had been exploring the creation of a channel that might someday compete with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox News Channel. Viacom denied that report, but a spokesman said the First has been in the works for about a year.\n\nThe Viacom spokesman said the First comes from an unnamed third-party partner. Pluto TV has several such partners: it has a Fox Sports-branded channel, CNN and the NFL Channel, for example.\n\nIn fact, the First isn\u2019t the only conservative news channel at Pluto TV, given it also features a Newsmax-branded channel.\n\nWhether launching the First is the entirety of Viacom\u2019s plans to wade into conservative television remains to be seen, as sources tell THR that more ambitious efforts had been bandied about, including rebranding one of the conglomerate\u2019s many cable channels. Viacom denies any such effort has been greenlit, though.\n\nViacom is trying to close a merger with CBS to create a $30 billion conglomerate to be called ViacomCBS, which will control Showtime, MTV, Comedy Central, BET, CBS, Nickelodeon and many other channels.", "description": "Viacom has quietly debuted a conservative news channel on Pluto TV, a digital platform it acquired for $340 million in March.", "authors": ["Paul Bond", "Paul.Bond Thr.Com"], "top_image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2019/10/im_right_with_jesse_kelly_plutotv_-_h_-_2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
