Many on the right cheered Trump\u2019s withdrawal from that pact and his reimposition of suffocating economic sanctions on Iran. But more recently, some have spoken out against the president\u2019s retreat from military action in response to Iranian provocations (recalling his predecessor\u2019s decision to pull back from enforcing his \u201cred line\u201d on chemical-weapons use in Syria), as well as his expressed openness to meeting with Iranian leaders without preconditions and to providing some economic relief to them in pursuit of a nuclear agreement (again \u00e0 la Obama). Those critics include his former Republican presidential challenger Ted Cruz and, reportedly, his just-departed national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nRead: Bolton\u2019s departure signals Trump\u2019s foreign-policy pivot\n\nA meeting next week between the U.S. and Iranian presidents at the United Nations General Assembly in New York seems off the table for now, particularly after the attack on a Saudi oil facility that both the Trump administration and the kingdom are attributing to Iran. But how Trump responds next could open him up to more criticism from his party. If that backlash comes, it would be remarkable, after Republicans have given him an out on so many other things:\n\nPretty much every element of Trump\u2019s diplomacy with North Korea.\n\nObama set off Republicans and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton during his first presidential campaign by pledging to meet unconditionally with the leaders of adversarial countries. His political opponents later pilloried him for appeasing America\u2019s authoritarian enemies in seeking to constrain Iran\u2019s nuclear program and reconcile with Cuba.\n\nImagine the uproar if Obama had held a splashy summit with Kim Jong Un in return for no substantive concessions on North Korea\u2019s nuclear-weapons arsenal\u2014let alone if he had done that three times, as Trump has, including the first presidential foray into North Korean territory. What if Obama had gushed about how he \u201cfell in love\u201d with North Korea\u2019s dictator? Or unabashedly taken the totalitarian leader\u2019s side in disputes with a former American vice president and the president\u2019s own national security adviser? Or absolved Kim of responsibility for the death of an American college student in North Korean captivity? Or castigated the CIA for cultivating Kim\u2019s half brother as an intelligence asset? Or, while we\u2019re at it, saluted a North Korean general?
