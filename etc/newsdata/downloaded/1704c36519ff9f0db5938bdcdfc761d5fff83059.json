Pakistan now offers an ETA (Electronic Travel Authority) to citizens of 50 countries, including Finland, Japan, Spain, Malta, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates -- but not, notably, the United States or the UK.\n\nRelated content Passports for purchase: Open citizenship doors around the world\n\nThe European countries of Denmark, Italy and Luxembourg hold third place in the index, with visa-free/visa-on-arrival access to 187 countries, while France, Spain and Sweden are in the fourth slot, with a score of 186.\n\nFive years ago, the United States and the UK topped the rankings in 2014 -- but both countries have now slipped down to sixth place, the lowest position either has held since 2010.\n\nWhile the Brexit process has yet to directly impact on the UK's ranking, the Henley Passport Index press release observed in July, \"with its exit from the EU now imminent, and coupled with ongoing confusion about the terms of its departure, the UK's once-strong position looks increasingly uncertain.\"\n\nThe United Arab Emirates continues its ascent up the rankings, up five places to rank 15th.\n\n\"It's the strongest climber this quarter,\" Lorraine Charles at Cambridge University's Centre for Business Research says in the October release.\n\n\"While the UAE may not be able to compete with Saudi Arabia -- the regional hegemon -- in terms of military strength and economic power, the projection of its soft power is uncontested in the GCC.\"\n\nAt the other end of the scale, Afghanistan is once again at the bottom of the rankings, with its citizens needing a prior visa for all but 25 destinations worldwide.\n\nDr. Christian H. Kaelin, Chairman of Henley & Partners and the creator of the passport index concept, says in the July release: \"With a few notable exceptions, the latest rankings from the Henley Passport Index show that countries around the world increasingly view visa-openness as crucial to economic and social progress.\"\n\nJapan has held onto the top spot throughout 2019.

Afghanistan (25)\n\nOther indexes\n\nHenley & Partner's list is one of several indexes created by financial firms to rank global passports according to the access they provide to their citizens.\n\nThe Henley Passport Index is based on data provided by the International Air Transport Authority (IATA) and covers 199 passports and 227 travel destinations. It is updated in real time throughout the year, as and when visa policy changes come into effect.\n\nArton Capital's Passport Index takes into consideration the passports of 193 United Nations member countries and six territories -- ROC Taiwan, Macau (SAR China), Hong Kong (SAR China), Kosovo, Palestinian Territory and the Vatican. Territories annexed to other countries are excluded.", "description": "Once again, Asia leads the way in the Henley Passport Index's guide to the world's most powerful passports.
