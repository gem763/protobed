Similar phrasing was used by Mercedes-Benz in February 2018 when it had to apologize for quoting the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, in a social media post. The auto company apologized for \u201cwrong information\u201d that \u201churt the feelings of Chinese people.\u201d\n\nMorey tweeted a now-deleted image that read \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d in reference to four months of pro-democracy demonstrations in the semiautonomous Chinese territory, which has been mired in escalating violence between protesters and law enforcement.\n\nAs a result of the tweet, the Chinese Basketball Association \u2014 whose president is Yao Ming, the former Rockets center \u2014 said Sunday it was suspending its relationship with the team, and Chinese media giant Tencent and Chinese state television said they would no longer be broadcasting Rockets games.\n\nFallout continued Monday when two NBA G League games between Houston\u2019s affiliate and Dallas\u2019 affiliate, scheduled to be played this month in China, were canceled.\n\nBoth Morey and the NBA then said his tweets do not represent the Rockets or the league.\n\nThe divergent language in the NBA\u2019s Chinese Weibo statement appears to be an effort to assuage people in China who have expressed outrage over Morey\u2019s initial tweet, though Monday\u2019s post appeared to be insufficient for many on Weibo. Commenters accused Morey of supporting Hong Kong independence and called on Chinese basketball fans to boycott the NBA.\n\nCalls to the NBA China offices in Beijing and Shanghai went unanswered Monday, a national holiday.\n\nMorey\u2019s tweet prompted a wave of censure from Chinese companies.\n\nA search Monday for Houston Rockets merchandise on Chinese e-commerce platform Taobao turned up zero results. Li-Ning, a major Chinese sporting goods brand, said in a statement Sunday it was suspending cooperation with the Rockets because of Morey\u2019s \u201cmistaken remarks.\u201d Hupu, a sports news website, has likewise suspended all coverage of the Rockets and locked the section of its website previously dedicated to the team.\n\nMeanwhile, some U.S. lawmakers and even Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro have condemned the NBA for succumbing to Chinese censorship.\n\nThe NBA has allowed and even encouraged its players and coaches to be outspoken on social and political issues in the United States, which makes this move stand out.\n\nA former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 under the framework of \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d which promises the territory certain democratic freedoms not afforded to the mainland. Some anti-government protesters in recent months have violently expressed their opposition to the ruling Communist Party.", "description": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 The NBA statement originally made in English had a different twist when it came out in Chinese.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/streeter-lecka-gty-640x480-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
