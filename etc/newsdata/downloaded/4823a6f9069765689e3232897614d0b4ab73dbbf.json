PHOTO: Moeketsi Mamane\n\nAn average of four muggings a day has dropped to zero in a CBD crime hotspot in recent weeks.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news resulting from an anti-crime offensive by Msunduzi\u2019s administrator on a major criminal hotspot in the city centre near the former Ematsheni Beer Hall.\n\nPrivate security sources said previously they experienced around four muggings daily in that area, but since the clean-up last month they have not attended to any.\n\nThe municipality\u2019s Safe City initiative said the clean-up of undergrowth which had become a hideout for thieves, vagrants, drug dealers and addicts appears to have broken the back of the crime in that vicinity. No official statistics have yet been recorded though.\n\nSafe City, which has a control room monitoring live video footage of the CBD, said Msunduzi\u2019s action has helped in drying up the \u201cHQ for criminals\u201d.\n\nCity administrator Sibusiso Sithole ordered the clean-up of a stretch of empty land at the corner of Retief and Hoosen Haffejee streets where Ematsheni was torn down and which criminals have been using to hide or escape.\n\nThe area is opposite the Masukwana Street taxi rank.\n\nThe Witness has reported extensively on crime in the area.\n\nIt was reported last year that on the nearby Masukwana Street dozens of vagrants stormed a supermarket and robbed it, prompting the owner to hire armed guards.\n\nThis year, business owners, concerned people and private security firms formed the Citizens On Patrol (COP) group, which is made up of business owners and private security firms to protect themselves against the onslaught of crime, particularly in the \u201cdowntown\u201d area.\n\nSafe City\u2019s Lucas Holtzhausen said Sithole had ordered the clearing of the area after hearing about the organisation\u2019s concerns around a month-and-a-half ago.\n\n\u201cVagrants used that bush as a hideout. They would rob people and run away into the bush. The police couldn\u2019t go in [after them] because the bush was full of human waste and things like broken glass,\u201d Holtzhausen told The Witness.\n\n\u201cNow we can see them \u2014 they have no hiding place.\n\n\u201cThat area is rotten with thugs. There is a big drug issue there, and vagrants used to rob people and there was a lot of theft out of cars and trucks. Some days there were three to four robberies. The elderly in particular were targeted,\u201d he said.\n\nHoltzhausen said petty crimes continue to plague the CBD, adding that crime was not really carried out by professional syndicates.\n\n\u201cThey will steal smallish items, whatever they can get their hands on, and sell it and buy drugs,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBy merely cleaning up the [Ematsheni beer hall] area, we\u2019ve solved a big problem.\u201d\n\nA COP representative said: \u201cThis goes to show what can happen when the City enforces bylaws. Crime can stop.\n\n\u201cIt has made a huge difference. Every other day there were three or four reports of muggings on Retief Street and no one dare chase them.\u201d\n\nCOP said clamping down on loitering and suspicious behaviour has also been shown to encourage people to return to the CBD to shop.\n\nThe chairperson of the Msunduzi Economic Development Agency, Kantha Naidoo, said she has noticed the number of complaints of crime in general from business owners in the downtown area drying up.\n\nShe said the situation made businesses hopeful, but said the City still needs to deal with the vagrant problem.\n\n\u201cThe drug problem is still an issue, and we need to establish a rehabilitation facility,\u201d she said.", "description": "An average of four muggings a day has dropped to zero in a CBD crime hotspot in recent weeks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9355/c4560502cd8f4851b8967f0759c1cffe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
