That meeting helped give rise to The Christchurch Call, a voluntary commitment signed in May by 18 countries including Canada, as well as several major tech companies, to stop the spread of extremism online.\n\nSignatory governments pledge, for example, to ensure their countries have effective laws to prevent the production and dissemination of terrorist content online, while tech companies commit to taking specific measures to stop extremist content from being uploaded or shared, like employing more humans to monitor and control live streaming.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau joined government and tech leaders in Paris for the Christchurch Call, a meeting aimed at curbing online extremism in the wake News Zealand's Christchurch massacre. 2:24\n\nThat's one example of what Smith calls a \"third wave\" of stronger regulations on the internet, that adapt to the realities of new and ever-changing technologies.\n\n\"The only way to give the public the ability to trust technology the way the public needs to and deserves to trust technology, is to ensure that no technology is above the law, to ensure that no company is above the law,\" he said.\n\nProduced by Ines Colabrese.", "description": "Microsoft global president Brad Smith wants technology companies and governments to work together to affect how technology is used, because he fears that the tools of the digital age could be turned into dangerous weapons.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5278932.1568207922!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/microsoft-housing-crisis-fund.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
