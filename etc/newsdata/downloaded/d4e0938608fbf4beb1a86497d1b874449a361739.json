I wasn't shocked at all when they got married years later.\"\n\nBrad and Angelina announced their romance in late 2005, months after his split from Jennifer, and always denied they were more than friends on set.\n\nBehar wasn't the only former bodyguard to dish the dirt on the couple after Brad and Ange announced they were separating in 2016.\n\nMark Billingham, who provided security for the couple and their six children for 18 months, stuck in the boot when he claimed he had practically fathered Brad's offspring.\n\n(Image: MB Pictures/REX)\n\n\"It was clear from the start we had a great chemistry and they trusted me with the kids,\" he told the Sun at the time.\n\n\"We got very close, I was living with them all the time. I could take the kids anywhere I wanted to on my own. No one else was allowed to do that\u2026 I took them swimming. I fathered them, basically.\"\n\nBillingham went on: \"What surprised me was their low level of common sense\n\n\"I found it crazy when they would ask me questions like, 'How do I go down to that bar?' and 'What do I need to do to get there?' They're not stupid, but because of the world they live in they just haven't done something like that for so long. I found that weird.\"\n\n(Image: MB Pictures/REX)\n\nThe ex-SAS soldier, who went on to become an instructor for Channel 4's SAS: Who Dares Wins, also revealed that his biggest challenge was protecting Brad, because \"people love her but hate him\".\n\n\"You have to figure out a way of protecting them from all that. It was challenging, but interesting,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Angelina has opened up on how how the last few years \"have not been the easiest\" for her after ending her 12-year relationship with Brad.\n\nThe 44-year-old Hollywood star told how her six children were the reason she \"pulled through\".\n\n\"Anyone who is a parent knows there is a strength within you that grows when you just have to survive anything to be strong enough for them and you have to pull them through anything,\" she said.", "description": "Celebrity bodyguard Mark Behar revealed how Brad and Ange would swap explicit notes through their network of minders", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Reuters", "Mb Pictures Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14056949.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Brad-Pitt-and-Angelina-Jolie.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
