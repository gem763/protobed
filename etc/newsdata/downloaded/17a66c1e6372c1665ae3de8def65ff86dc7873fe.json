More pressingly, he\u2019d never beaten Federer\u2014his friend and sometimes practice partner\u2014in seven prior matches.\n\nBut inside a packed Arthur Ashe Stadium\u2014per usual, pulling heavily for Federer\u2014Dimitrov played composed, consistent tennis, recovering from his mistakes and taking advantage of his opponent\u2019s weary body.\n\nFederer, 38, appeared to tire as the match dragged on. He took a lengthy medical break after losing the fourth set, but it did little good, as Dimitrov roared out to a 4-0 lead and closed out the match without trouble.\n\nIt was a disappointing exit for Federer, who played brilliantly to reach the Wimbledon final this year, but has not won the U.S. Open since 2008. His loss also quashed hopes of a Federer-Nadal final on Sunday; amazingly, the two rivals have never played each other at this tournament.\n\nGrigor Dimitrov celebrates after defeating Roger Federer.

Dimitrov entered Tuesday\u2019s match having lost seven of his last eight matches on tour, dropping his ranking out of the Top 50.\n\nNow Dimitrov will face Russia\u2019s Daniil Medvedev Friday with a chance to go to his first major tournament final.\n\nThe 23-year-old, fifth-seeded Medvedev won his quarterfinal against Stan Wawrinka earlier in the day, 7-6(6), 6-3, 1-6, 6-1. Like Dimitrov, he has yet to make the final of a major.\n\nWrite to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com", "description": "Grigor Dimitrov stunned third-seeded Roger Federer in the U.S. Open quarterfinals Tuesday, 3-6, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2.", "authors": ["Jason Gay", "Jason.Gay Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103725/social"}
