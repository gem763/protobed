General manager Mike Rizzo and manager Dave Martinez must figure out the postseason roster for the National League Wild Card Game Tuesday.\n\nPitching coach Paul Menhart and hitting coach Kevin Long will provide input along with other coaches and front office personnel.\n\n\u201cIt will be a roundtable discussion,\u201d Menhart said, \u201cand ultimately Dave and Mike will make the decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will sit down with some of our analytical guys as well,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cYou want to cover all your bases.\u201d\n\nMartinez was part of those postseason discussions before, as a bench coach with Tampa Bay and the Chicago Cubs.\n\nThe starting pitcher will be the most important decision, with the debate most likely between Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg. Any of the big three starters, including lefty Patrick Corbin, could be used out of the bullpen Tuesday if they do not start. Scherzer started on Tuesday against the Philadelphia Phillies, while Strasburg is slated to pitch Thursday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cIn an elimination game, it is all hands on deck,\u201d Menhart said. \u201cIf guys are available, we are going to use them. We have to go with our horses if we have to.\u201d\n\nAnother factor in roster construction is how many and which relievers to use. Menhart said it depends on who they\u2019ll play, which is most likely going to be the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\n\u201cThat is how we run our show on a daily basis,\u201d Menhart said. \u201cWe try to match up our best arms for the success they have had in the past. We make our decisions based on that.\u201d\n\nOne encouraging development is catcher Kurt Suzuki, who made throws to second base before Wednesday\u2019s game. Martinez hopes he can catch Friday or Saturday \u2014 something he has not done in nearly three weeks.\n\nReliever Daniel Hudson, who had saves in both doubleheader games Tuesday, made his postseason debut in 2011 as a starting pitcher for the Arizona Diamondbacks. Now, he returns to the playoffs for the first time in eight years.\n\nHudson said the daily message from Martinez makes sense.\n\n\u201cYou have to stay in the moment and go 1-0 today,\u201d he said, echoing one of Martinez\u2019s favorite phrases.\n\nThe bullpen takes on added importance in the playoffs, with managers pulling starters quickly at the first sign of trouble. One of the Nationals\u2019 most reliable relievers now is Hudson, who was acquired at the trade deadline.\n\nHudson said who makes the postseason roster is out of the players\u2019 control.\n\n\u201cIt is not really in our hands, so you don\u2019t think about it much,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cThere are not going to be any egos hurt. We have to go out there with our best guys and get it done.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals were 88-69 going into Wednesday\u2019s home game with the Phillies. The Brewers were 87-70 and held the second wild card spot behind Washington. The Brewers still had an outside chance, though, to catch the St. Louis Cardinals for first place in the NL Central.\n\nThe Brewers played the Reds on Wednesday night, and then end regular-season play this weekend at the Rockies. Washington begins a three-game set with Cleveland on Friday.\n\nPredicted roster for NL Wild Card Game:\n\nPitchers (12) \u2013 Patrick Corbin, Sean Doolittle, Javy Guerra, Daniel Hudson, Tanner Rainey, Fernando Rodney, Anibal Sanchez, Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg, Hunter Strickland, Wander Suero, Austin Voth\n\nCatchers (2) \u2013 Yan Gomes, Kurt Suzuki\n\nInfielders (7) \u2013 Matt Adams, Asdrubal Cabrera, Brian Dozier, Howie Kendrick, Anthony Rendon, Trea Turner, Ryan Zimmerman\n\nOutfielders (4) \u2013 Adam Eaton, Gerardo Parra, Victor Robles, Juan Soto\n\n\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
