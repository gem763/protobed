It is a concerning position to be in nine months out from the Tokyo Olympics and one that places British Athletics performance director Neil Black\u2019s position in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to feel really, really good and really, really positive about,\u201d Black said. \u201cBut the reality is the medal tally is not that which we would have wanted and expected.\n\n\u201cIt could be better, it should be better. We\u2019ll obviously be talking with UK Sport and working together, reviewing, planning, what have we learnt, what are we going to do about it, and how do we \u00adconvert the \u2018nearlies\u2019 into medals?\u201d\n\nThe final tally could have been so different, with Callum Hawkins and the British women\u2019s 4x400m relay team falling agonisingly short of the podium in fourth place on the last day of action, while Jake Wightman finished fifth in the 1500m.\n\nIn fact, for some time the British 4x400m women thought they had won bronze. In farcical scenes \u00adalmost an hour after Zoey Clark, Jodie Williams, Emily Diamond and Laviai Nielsen had crossed the line in fourth place, the British quartet were upgraded a position when they succeeded in having Jamaica thrown out of the contest.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat decision came after Britain appealed the initial result, claiming one of the Jamaican runners had lined up in the wrong position at one of the changeovers. However, the disqualification was short-lived when Jamaica counter-appealed and were reinstated to bronze some 90 minutes after the race.\n\nVictory for the United States provided Allyson Felix with a record 13th world medal, despite only \u00adrunning in the heats, while Poland took silver.\n\nRabah Yousif (right) and Toby Harries drop the baton during their changeover in the 4x400 metres relay final Credit: PA\n\n\u201cWe ran our socks off, every single one of us,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cWe wanted that medal so, so badly. That\u2019s the fastest we\u2019ve run in years, it surpasses the Olympics, and I think we can be proud of ourselves.\u201d\n\nDespite missing out on a medal, Britain\u2019s 4x400m women had more success than their male counterparts. Having only snuck into the final after another team was disqualified, the men got no further than second-leg runner Toby Harries who, on his senior international debut, failed to pass the baton to Rabah Yousif and was left flat on his back. The British team had been battling it out for last place when the blunder occurred, with the US going on to take gold.\n\nBritain\u2019s triple-pronged attack at a 1500m medal also fell short, with Wightman coming closest to the podium with a fifth-place finish, \u00addespite running a Scottish record.\n\nTimothy Cheruiyot proved a class apart to claim gold for Kenya. Josh Kerr ran a personal best to finish sixth, with Neil Gourley 11th.\n\n\u201cTo be within striking distance of that medal meant I was running to my limit,\u201d Wightman said. \u201cI really couldn\u2019t do anything else.\u201d\n\nFellow Scot Hawkins had experienced heartache yet again in the early hours of the morning by matching his fourth-place marathon finish from the London World Championships two years ago.\n\nHawkins seemed to time his attack to perfection, reeling in the leaders with around one mile to go, only to be run out of the medals in a sprint finish as Lelisa Desisa took gold for Ethiopia.", "description": "For all the gloss of Dina Asher-Smith\u2019s incredible triumphs over the course of her glorious week here, there is no hiding from the fact that Britain head for home with their worst World Championships medal haul for 14 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MfxM.l1SvgrHXVobYYeyeA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TD8LslYbmVXtDwoVA45YcQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/76d837bbf9322274ca0329571155b891", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
