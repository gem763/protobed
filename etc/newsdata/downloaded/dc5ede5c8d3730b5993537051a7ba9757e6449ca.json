I shared his skepticism. It was indeed my destination\u2014Kingsland Ward at St. John, a century-old hospital\u2014but it looked entirely abandoned. When the unmarked door creaked open, however, a woman dressed as a nurse checked my name off her list and ushered me inside. For the next two hours, 14 fellow \u201cinmates\u201d and I were led through 22 decorated rooms, the sprawling stage of \u201cThen She Fell,\u201d a dreamlike theatrical piece inspired by \u201cAlice in Wonderland.\u201d We jumped between seats at a Mad Hatter\u2019s tea party and watched acrobatic couples climb the walls together. At one point, I lay on a cot alongside the White Queen as she told me a bedtime story, while I tried not to look painfully self-conscious.\n\nCall it the \u201cSleep No More\u201d effect. Since 2011, when the creative reworking of \u201cMacbeth\u201d opened in the McKittrick Hotel in Chelsea to huge acclaim and financial success, New York has thrown itself into immersive theater with gusto. The city now offers an ever-changing roster of live events that abandon traditional theater settings and grab audiences by engaging all the senses. Some ladle out gourmet food or craft cocktails, others waft fragrances or host interactive magic shows or poetry readings. All cater to an untraditional desire to become part of the action.\n\n\u201cAudiences today would rather have their own experience than sit and watch one passively from a seat,\u201d said Arthur Karpati, a producer of \u201cSleep No More.\u201d\n\nThese site-specific events offer travelers a bonus benefit\u2014an opportunity to visit restricted or forgotten corners of New York, from Gilded Age mansions to historic graveyards or (as with \u201cThen She Fell\u201d) ghostly hospital wards that leave cabdrivers concerned for your safety. I\u2019ve lived in Manhattan for over 20 years, but I recently decided to see what other secret portals the latest immersive shows might open. I would have to be discerning: The bewildering variety of options ranges from the genuinely moving to the comic and downright hokey. \u201cWhenever I hear the word \u2018immersive,\u2019 I roll my eyes,\u201d said DeeDee Luxe, an actress and producer at Manhattan venues including the McKittrick Hotel. People bandy the buzzword about so freely in the theater world now, she said, that it risks losing its meaning.\n\nSome venues are hidden in plain sight. One night, to experience the less-than-reverent \u201cDrunk Shakespeare,\u201d I climbed an anonymous stairwell in Times Square and stumbled into a large room furnished like an antique library, save for the bar set up in a corner. Each performance features a different play. The night I was there both the audience and the performers imbibed liberally, an actress knocking back shots while channeling Lady Macbeth and presenting a hilarious, fractured and\u2014by the end of the night\u2014slurred slice of \u201cthe Scottish play.\u201d\n\n\u2018Carmen: To Havana and Back,\u2019 performed in a basement bar.

Last fall, I ventured to Brooklyn\u2019s 478-acre Green-Wood Cemetery for \u201cNightfall,\u201d an annual event. It was uniquely spooky to wander the candlelit grounds after dark, slipping at will between the tombstones to encounter circus acts, storytellers and even a classical concert in the catacombs.\n\n\u2018Nightfall,\u2019 at Green-Wood Cemetery.

At the hands-on museum Spyscape, in Times Square, for example, visitors can dodge green lasers \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d-style, break spy codes and practice their lying skills. Clearly, technology is the way of things to come. Recent advances in VR (Virtual Reality), AR (Augmented Reality) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) offer new possibilities in immersive theater. To get a sense of it, I hopped a ferry at Battery Park one crystalline morning to visit the Future of StoryTelling Summit (FoST), an annual, experimental-theater festival that incorporates the latest gadgetry into its performances, many happening simultaneously. It was held at a New York attraction I\u2019d never heard of, the Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Gardens in Staten Island, a complex that began life as a 19th-century home for retired sailors and is now run by the National Park Service. As I wandered through it, I stopped to take a VR tour of an Amazon tributary, then later, exploring the site\u2019s gardens, I found myself sipping a cocktail with an actress in Edwardian dress who was channeling Mrs. Dalloway, the heroine of the eponymous Virginia Woolf novel.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Which immersive entertainment experience has been your favorite? Why? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe most memorable moments blended the traditional and futuristic. I wandered into a tent for \u201cAnnabellee,\u201d a multidimensional exhibit inspired by Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s last poem about a doomed young woman, to find a mysterious, elfin grotto of babbling fountains, ancient herbs and dangling crystals. Creator Ava Lee Scott put me through a \u201ccleansing ritual,\u201d with incense and melodies wafting around me; I then put on a headset to meet an avatar for a virtual tarot reading. \u201cNothing will ever replace live theater,\u201d Ms. Scott said later, when she had stepped out of character. \u201cBut technology is providing the tools to go further into the intimate experience.\u201d\n\nCharles Melcher, FoST\u2019s director, sums up the appeal of immersive theater another way: \u201cTo explore beautiful sets and see stories unfold and choose how to navigate them\u2014it brings all your senses alive. And that doesn\u2019t get old.\u201d\n\nWaaaaaay Off Broadway / A guide to interactive theater New York City\n\nAs with all experimental theater in the sky-high-rent city, the immersive world changes rapidly. A good place to start is the website devoted to the form, No Proscenium (noproscenium.com), or to simply check the latest on the McKittrick website (mckittrickhotel.com). As well as the famous \u201cSleep No More\u201d (which is now as much of a \u201cmust-see\u201d for travelers to New York as the Statue of Liberty), the multi-level venue offers Speakeasy Magick, a night of close encounters with the city\u2019s top illusionists, The Bartschland Follies, a raucous Weimar-style cabaret hosted by downtown diva Susanne Bartsch, and a roster of one-off immersive parties, including an upcoming three-night Halloween event on a Hitchcock theme. Even the outdoor rooftop restaurant, Gallow Green, is often prowled by actors posing as hotel \u201cresidents.\u201d\n\nThen She Fell, a cocktail-fueled take on the \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d theme by Third Rail Projects, is running in its eerie Williamsburg location until the end of the year (thenshefell.com, from $125). A raunchier retelling of the Lewis Carroll classic, also in Brooklyn, is \u201cQueen of Hearts\u201d by the dance troupe Company XIV, which has converted its Bushwick space into the Palace of Versailles for a night of \u201cbaroque burlesque\u201d (companyxiv.com; from $115, until Nov 2). Back across the East River in Midtown Manhattan, the long-running Drunk Shakespeare has become popular enough to offer half-price Groupon deals (drunkshakespeare.com, $55), while in the heart of the Theater District, a ticket to Imbible includes three craft cocktails (imbible.nyc, $85). For a taste of 1950s Cuba on the Lower East Side, Carmen: To Havana and Back, a reworking of the classic Bizet opera into a salsa extravaganza, has been extended until Thanksgiving (varietylifeproductions.com, $69).\n\nOne of the pleasures of many immersive shows is the opportunity to explore lesser-known New York attractions. In late October, Brooklyn\u2019s Victorian-era Green-Wood Cemetery will be taken over for a two-day adult event Nightfall (green-wood.com), while classical concerts will be held over the next few weeks inside the acoustics-friendly catacombs with the Angel\u2019s Share Series (deathofclassical.com). The curiosity-loving group Atlas Obscura organizes pop-up immersive gatherings in unusual locales, including last year, a Poe-themed party involving actors, readings and burlesque in a private penthouse and a theatrical \u2018garden party\u2019 in Hudson River mansion (atlasobscura.com/events). The Poetry Brothel offers louche interactive literary parties in speakeasy settings such as the Back Room on the Lower East Side (thepoetrybrothel.com). Also check the websites of the House of Yes (houseofyes.org), the Menagerie d\u2019Arte of the Dalia Carella Dance Collective (daliacarella.com/menagerie-darte) and Speakeasy Dollhouse (speakeasydollhouse.com), whose shows have recently involved such historical New York celebrities such as Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., and Harry Houdini, and the upcoming Illuminati Ball, a pricey immersive masquerade (from $250, theilluminatiball.com).For a taste of immersive theater in the digital age, the Future of StoryTelling (futureofstorytelling.org) has held pop-ups and an annual summit, which has included speakers such as Al Gore and Margaret Atwood (although it is on hiatus in 2019, it will return in the fall of 2020.) One high-tech piece that trialed there last year involving an Edgar Allan Poe theme has evolved into The Raven, which will premiere October 10 as part of the New York Film Festival. Audience members will don Bose glasses to experience the latest advances in AR and AI, all while exploring the four-story Gilded Age townhouse of the American Irish Historical Society on Fifth Avenue. \u201cImagine \u2018Sleep No More\u2019 where the masks talk to you,\u201d says creator Ava Lee Scott. \u201cThat\u2019s our show.\u201d ($85, theraven.show).\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nSpyscape is a hands-on museum in New York\u2019s Times Square.
