The stock was at $5.52 on August 7. Mr Geminder said on Wednesday that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for 2018-19 was now likely to be around $245 million. The company had previously forecast an EBITDA range of between $270 million to $285 million.\n\nMr Geminder told shareholders at the annual meeting on Wednesday that the new forecasts assumed no recovery of input price lags. But if there were a faster clawback of those cost rises then the outlook would improve.\n\nPact has been on the skids since a poor profit result on August 15, which undershot expectations by around 10 per cent.\n\nMr Geminder is the brother-in-law of Australia's richest person Anthony Pratt, and was listed at No.53 in the latest Financial Review Rich List. Pact was formed in 2002 after Mr Geminder engineered the management buyout of several underperforming assets from Visy Industries. Pact listed on the ASX in late 2013 at an issue price of $3.80.\n\nMr Geminder on September 10 revealed he would temporarily assume the company's top leadership position as executive chairman in the wake of a speedy exit by chief executive Malcolm Bundey, who departed just weeks after the poor financial result that triggered a share price collapse. Mr Geminder said on Wednesday a global search was continuing for a new chief executive.\n\nPact has a high-powered board of directors including former Smorgon Steel chief executive Ray Horsburgh, former GUD Holdings chief executive Jonathan Ling, ex National Foods boss Peter Margin and Lyndsey Cattermole, who has just stepped off the board of Penfolds owner Treasury Wine Estates. Ms Cattermole is one of the new directors appointed to the Myer board as the department store group tries to engineer a retail turnaround and evade the clutches of retailing billionaire Solomon Lew, a long-time critic of the way Myer is being run.\n\nMr Geminder said there was an \"urgent need\" for Pact to cut costs across its network. A revamp of its network is underway with a \"renewed sense of speed and urgency\". The company believes it can generate up to $50 million in extra EBITDA through efficiency benefits and the payback on the capital required to implement the overhaul would be less than three-and-a-half years.\n\nHe also said that Pact wouldn't back off from making more acquisitions and that it remained a \"core growth driver\" for the company. Pact had expanded into contract manufacturing and pooling and there were more opportunities in the industry, which was undergoing consolidation.\n\nThe TIC Retail Accessories business supplies garment hangers, clips and security tags to a large number of clothing manufacturers who sell to major retailers in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and United States. The company collects the hangers, clips and security tags from the retail chains and has a re-use rate of about 80 per cent. It has been expanding in Hong Kong, China, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh as clothing makers shifted their operations to \"fast fashion\" manufacturing centres.", "description": "Packaging firm Pact Group has watched $800m in sharemarket value vanish with Rich Lister Raphael Geminder bearing the brunt.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.6135%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1304%2C$x_304%2C$y_232/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bc54ed33557f19babc0e412782e54b0993c0713a", "published_at": "2018-11-14"}
