Never,\" Schiff said in a statement. \"This raises serious concerns about whether White House, Department of Justice or other executive branch officials are trying to prevent a legitimate whistleblower complaint from reaching its intended recipient, the Congress, in order to cover up serious misconduct.\"\n\nSchiff indicated that he learned the matter involved \"potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community,\" raising the specter that it is \"being withheld to protect the President or other Administration officials.\" In addition, Schiff slammed Maguire for consulting the Justice Department about the whistleblower complaint \"even though the statute does not provide you discretion to review, appeal, reverse, or countermand in any way the [inspector general's] independent determination, let alone to involve another entity within the Executive Branch.\"\n\n\"The Committee can only conclude, based on this remarkable confluence of factors, that the serious misconduct at issue involves the President of the United States and/or other senior White House or Administration officials,\" Schiff wrote in a letter to Maguire on Friday.\n\nThe initial whistleblower complaint was filed last month, and Schiff indicated that it was required by law to be shared with Congress nearly two weeks ago. His subpoena requires the information to be turned over by Sept. 17 or else he intends to compel Maguire to appear before Congress in a public hearing on Sept. 19.\n\nSchiff said Maguire declined to confirm or deny whether the whistleblower's complaint relates to anything the Intelligence Committee is currently investigating or whether White House lawyers were involved in the decision-making about the complaint.\n\nOfficials in Maguire\u2019s office acknowledged Schiff\u2019s subpoena late Friday.\n\n\u201cWe received the HPSCI's subpoena this evening. We are reviewing the request and will respond appropriately,\u201d said a senior intelligence official. \u201cThe ODNI and Acting DNI Maguire are committed to fully complying with the law and upholding whistleblower protections and have done so here.\u201d", "description": "Schiff accused acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire of taking extraordinary steps to withhold the complaint from Congress.", "authors": ["Kyle Cheney"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/27/35/60483e1946d8aae8d9ca76fbb319/190913-schiff-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
