REUTERS/Michael Dalder/File Photo\n\nDemocrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday launched a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, accusing him of seeking foreign help to smear Democratic rival Joe Biden ahead of next year\u2019s election.\n\nSpot gold was down 0.1% at $1,529.62 per ounce, as of 0429 GMT, after having risen to its highest level since Sept. 5 at $1,535.60 on Tuesday. U.S. gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,537.00 per ounce.\n\n\u201cCompounding into the macro weakness we have the tumult in political landscape brought about by the impeachment process,\u201d said AxiTrader market strategist Stephen Innes.\n\n\u201cThe risk could lead to lower equity market and undermine the U.S. dollar and that could be good for gold.\u201d\n\nAlso, supporting the yellow metal was weak U.S. consumer confidence data that ratcheted up concerns over the global economy.\n\n\u201cIt stoked Fed rate-cut speculation, driving down yields and thereby boosting the relative appeal of non-interest-bearing assets epitomised by gold,\u201d said Ilya Spivak, a senior currency strategist at DailyFx.\n\nMeanwhile, the dollar steadied in Asian trade, while stocks fell as U.S. political uncertainty added to worries about economies strained by the Sino-U.S. trade row. [USD/][MKTS/GLOB]\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric on China turned harsh once again on Tuesday as he delivered a stinging rebuke to Beijing\u2019s trade practices at the United Nations General Assembly, saying he would not accept a \u201cbad deal\u201d in U.S.-China trade negotiations.\n\n\u201cThe market is still waiting for some more definitive news on the trade front... Investors who are long are going to sell at such a high level,\u201d AxiTrader\u2019s Innes said.\n\nThe tone of Trump\u2019s speech was at odds with some recent steps by China to meet his request for purchases of more American farm products. The two parties are meeting again in October for talks.\n\nSpot gold may rise more to $1,546 per ounce, as it has cleared a resistance at $1,524, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.\n\nAmong other precious metals, palladium dipped 0.2% to$1,669.49 an ounce after hitting a record peak of $1,676.53 earlier in the session.\n\nSilver fell 0.3% to $18.52 an ounce, while platinum was flat at $953.02.", "description": "Gold prices inched lower on Wednesday as some investors booked profit, but the metal remained supported below a three-week peak hit in the prior session as the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump stoked political worries.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433621136&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O07P", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
