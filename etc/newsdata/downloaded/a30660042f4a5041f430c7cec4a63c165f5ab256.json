Joe Biden is no exception | Bhaskar Sunkara", "language": "en", "text": "This weekend, Joe Biden was attacked for another bizarre, almost free association, remark. Responding to a question from the moderator Linsey Davis about what it would take to repair the legacy of slavery in America, Biden had a long, confusing reply.\n\nLook, there\u2019s institutional segregation in this country. And from the time I got involved, I started dealing with that. Red lining, banks, making sure we are in a position where \u2013 look, you talk about education. I propose that what we take is those very poor schools, the Title I schools, triple the amount of money we spend from $15 to $45bn a year. Give every single teacher a raise to the equal raise of getting out of the $60,000 level. Number two, make sure that we bring in to help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home. The problems that come from home. We need, we have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today. It\u2019s crazy. The teachers are \u2013 I\u2019m married to a teacher, my deceased wife is a teacher. They have every problem coming to them. We have to make sure that every single child does, in fact, have three, four, and five-year-olds go to school. School, not daycare. School. We bring social workers into homes with parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to help, they don\u2019t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television \u2013 make sure you have the record player on at night, the phone. Make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school \u2013 a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.\n\nWith a bit of deciphering, we can get the gist of the message: black Americans are impacted not just by institutional racism, but by the impact that racism has had on their culture. Poor black parents don\u2019t just lack the material means to provide for their children, but they lack the knowledge and culture to do so, as well.\n\nTaken along with his other recent statements, and the fact that he opposed busing and other attempts to remedy the very institutional segregation he mentions, liberals like Time\u2019s Anand Giridharadas have called Biden \u201cracist, classist, incoherent\u201d. For Giridharadas and others, the debate moment in particular was \u201cdisqualifying\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe only problem is, wrong as Biden is, he\u2019s just repeating what has been commonsense for generations of politicians, Democrat and Republican alike. Even Barack Obama had a knack for inventing stories about black kids being told by other black kids that studying hard in school was \u201cacting white\u201d, or appealing to \u201cCousin Pookie\u201d and \u201cUncle Jethro\u201d to be better and more engaged citizens.\n\nBlack students, for what it\u2019s worth, tend to put more emphasis on educational achievement (and show more pride in their peers\u2019s accomplishments) than white students. Despite rightwing suppression efforts, black voters, too, now vote at a higher rate than any other group in the country.\n\nAs Ta-Nehisi Coates pointed out in the Atlantic at the time, how different are Obama\u2019s comments from Paul Ryan\u2019s lamentation:\n\nWe have got this tailspin of culture, in our inner cities in particular, of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work, and so there is a real culture problem here that has to be dealt with.\n\nIn many ways, the \u201cculture of poverty\u201d discourse has liberal political roots. Influenced by the anthropologist Oscar Lewis, Lyndon B Johnson\u2019s assistant secretary of labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote the influential The Negro Family: The Case for National Action (the \u201cMoynihan Report\u201d) in 1965. Generations of thinkers on the right had seen racial inequality as merely the reflection of the inherent inferiority of black people. Moynihan, on the other hand, was a progressive who recognized the persistence of racism and saw the roots of racial inequality as being material.\n\nBut the legacy of \u201cthree centuries of sometimes unimaginable mistreatment\u201d, he wrote, had created a culture of poverty that had to be addressed so that civil rights legislation and the ongoing war on poverty could actually uplift black Americans. If you just give the black poor money and services, the argument went, it wouldn\u2019t have the intended effect.\n\nWhatever Moynihan\u2019s goals, his claim that black family structures were reinforcing black poverty proved resilient. Biological explanations for racial disparities were thankfully now taboo, but it was an easy step from saying that the black poor were the victims of a culture of poverty to saying that the black poor who couldn\u2019t pull themselves out of a culture of poverty didn\u2019t deserve state aid.\n\n\n\nRonald Reagan did just that, with his stories about \u201cwelfare queens\u201d who lived off of government assistance and refused to work. Bill Clinton continued in his footsteps, pledging to \u201cend welfare as we know it\u201d, and he did just that in power.\n\nLike Obama\u2019s complaints about black school children ridiculing their studious peers for \u201cacting white\u201d, the generalization had no basis. As Jonah Birch and Paul Heideman write, \u201cblack job seekers are even more resilient than their white counterparts, staying in the job market longer despite persistent frustrations of their search for employment.\u201d And that among black single mothers, \u201c[their] families were a major contributor to the high value they placed on education and finding a career. Far from being the transmission belt of a \u2018culture of dependency\u2019, black families act as a support network encouraging their members to achieve as much as possible.\u201d\n\nYet the \u201cculture of poverty\u201d \u2013 in both its Democratic and Republican variants \u2013 persists. Though much of this mythology relies on racist tropes, it also reflects more generally what the professional middle class (and elite politicians like Obama) think about those below them on the class ladder. You can hear echoes, more vicious than Biden\u2019s comments last week, in the National Review complaint that many poor white people were suffering because of \u201cBad decisions and basic human failure...\u201d or in JD Vance\u2019s Hillbilly Elegy, which opines that \u201cyou can walk through a town where 30% of the young men work fewer than twenty hours a week and find not a single person aware of his own laziness\u201d.\n\nThere is finally pushback to the idea that the victims of an exploitative and violent society are sleeping in a bed of their own making. But the solution isn\u2019t Biden taking sensitivity courses and being less racist or \u201cclassist\u201d \u2013 we need to combat the real sources of racial and class inequality.\n\nIt\u2019s not too complicated, we all basically want the same things: a decent paying job, quality medical care, good schools for our children, leaders who respect us and act with integrity. This cuts across backgrounds, they\u2019re simple expectations of a good state that most working people feel like they deserve. And they\u2019re outcomes we can guarantee through robust entitlements.\n\nWhy, then, this obsession on what poor people, particularly poor black people, are doing wrong? It\u2019s simple: both Democrats and Republicans have preferred a patchwork, punitive and degrading welfare state over an efficient, well-funded, universal one. They\u2019d rather blame the oppressed than lift them out of oppression. They\u2019d rather talk about culture than challenge corporations.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with Joe Biden that doesn\u2019t afflict the political establishment as a whole.", "description": "Both Democrats and Republicans attack black culture, but refuse to enact the redistribution of wealth and power that could end racial inequity", "authors": ["Bhaskar Sunkara"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a626c2c7d4c85db92d5f3e2aabc8609d51f8779/0_220_5217_3131/master/5217.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=db69e61539ac869035db1877ea528724", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
