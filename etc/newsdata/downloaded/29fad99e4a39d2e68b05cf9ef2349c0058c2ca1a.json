Schools will serve breakfast and lunch, but all after-school activities, including sports, tutoring and field trips, are also canceled. Late on Wednesday afternoon, CTU's delegates overwhelmingly reaffirmed their decision earlier this month to go a strike on Thursday if the union was unable to come to a contract agreement with Chicago Public Schools (CPS), said teachers union president Jesse Sharkey.\n\n\"We have not achieved what we need to bring justice and high-quality schools to the children and teachers of Chicago,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to wage increases, the teachers union is demanding more funding to ease overcrowded classrooms and hire more support staff, two perennial issues plaguing the school district.\n\nThe district's bargaining team has offered 80 proposed changes to the current contract related to issues requested by the union, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said earlier Wednesday.\n\n\"I was disappointed by the CTU's decision to begin a work stoppage and force the cancellation of classes,\" Lightfoot said at a late afternoon briefing. \"We rolled up our sleeves and negotiated in good faith over a long period of time.\"\n\nCPS has also offered teachers a 16% raise over five years along with support for oversized classes, enforceable targets for reducing class sizes and adding more support staff across the district, she said.\n\nThe mayor said the union's demands would cost the district an additional $2.5 billion annually.\n\nCPS finances \"are still recovering from the brink of insolvency, and we do not have unlimited funds,\" the mayor said.\n\nThe district's credit ratings remain at the non-investment, or \"junk\" status, although they have improved in the wake of a revised state-wide school funding formula that boosted revenue for CPS operations and pension payments.\n\nThousands of Chicago teachers staged a one-day walkout in 2016 to protest the lack of a contract at that time and failures to stabilize the finances.\n\nDistrict officials encouraged students to go to public libraries and community organizations where educational programs and activities will be offered during the strike.\n\nIn addition to schools, park facilities across the city will be open for children during the strike after the city reached a labor agreement on Wednesday with the union representing city park workers.\n\nThe agreement with the union includes wage increases ranging from 10% to 28% over the four and a half years and for paid vacation to hourly employees based on the number of hours worked, Lightfoot said.
