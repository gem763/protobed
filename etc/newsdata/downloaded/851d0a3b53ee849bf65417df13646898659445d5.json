(Amanda Pfeffer/CBC)\n\nOntario Public Health's ByWard Market clinic is open 15 hours a week for walk-ins, spread between three weekdays, with appointments and a Thursday evening clinic in Centretown specifically for queer men won top of that.\n\nIt reports its laboratories can get most tests back within three days, with a positive gonorrhea test taking up to nine days for Ottawa patients.\n\nThe province's's health agency reports test results can take between two and four weeks in western Quebec.\n\nCastonguay said Gatineau's wait means a longer delay for treatment and potential higher costs down the road for the health care system as a result.\n\nShe said it also means the infection could spread during the interim.\n\n\"We haven't reached a public health crisis, but if we don't do something, it could become one.\"\n\nBallooning rates\n\nCISSS did not provide its numbers of confirmed STI cases in time for publication.\n\nOttawa Public Health (OPH) reports rates of chlamydia have risen almost 50 per cent over the last five years, and the number of gonorrhea and syphilis cases have more than tripled in the same time period.\n\nThe increases are much higher than the Canadian rates which show, for example, an 81 per cent increase in gonorrhea rates from 2006 until 2017.\n\n\"Are we concerned? Absolutely,\" said Pam Oickle, program manager for infectious disease at OPH.\n\nShe said Ottawa can get a patient showing symptoms into a clinic within 24 hours for a blood or urine test.\n\nOickle said the health agency has invested more resources into tackling the growing problem, adding two more staff to deal with the rise in the number of cases, and will also be launching a new social media campaign to encourage regular testing.", "description": "Western Quebec's wait times for results of sexually transmitted infection tests are significantly longer than those in Ottawa.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5314247.1570579191!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/anne-castonguay-director-bras-outaouais.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
