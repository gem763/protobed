Track and field\u2019s governing body, the IAAF, and the organization that handles its doping cases, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU), are also expected to review the information while in Doha, Qatar, next week for track world championships.\n\nThe IAAF will receive a report - one that could include this information - from a task force that has upheld the Russian track team\u2019s suspension from international competition 11 times since its federation was first banned in June 2016. Worlds start next Friday, and at least 129 Russians are slated to compete as neutral athletes.\n\nA RUSADA on solid footing was thought to be a cornerstone requirement for Russia\u2019s return to the international sports world after a scandal that sullied two Olympics, along with the reputations of both WADA and the International Olympic Committee, which critics - especially in the West - deemed as going too soft on the Russians.\n\nThis latest news could lead to RUSADA again being deemed noncompliant, though the long-term repercussions of such a move are hard to gauge, especially with the IOC having placed Russia\u2019s Olympic committee back in good standing after the Pyeongchang Olympics last year.\n\nOne theory is that because the revamped and reinstated RUSADA has been meeting testing benchmarks set for it by WADA, and because it didn\u2019t have anything to do with the manipulation of the data, it could have a good chance of winning a case in front of the Court of Arbitration for Sport. If manipulation is proven, WADA would also have to decide whether it could win cases against Russians with data that is now unreliable.\n\nThe samples the doping Russian athletes provided to testers aren\u2019t enough to convict in most cases because their drug-tainted urine was replaced by clean samples. That\u2019s why the Moscow lab data was considered critical to prosecuting the cases.\n\nWADA has been handing over most of the evidence to international sports federations. WADA president Craig Reedie recently said he expected around 100 new Russian cases to be brought.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-Sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Russian anti-doping agency could face suspension again based on information indicating data from the Moscow drug-testing lab had been manipulated before being delivered to the World Anti-Doping Agency earlier this year, a person familiar with the case told The Associated Press.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eddie Pells"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
