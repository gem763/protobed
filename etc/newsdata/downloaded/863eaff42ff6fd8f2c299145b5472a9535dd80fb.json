Most of all his father, Sireli, who is the reason while Sam might look like a big, beaming Pacific Islander, he sounds like a Wurzel.\n\n\u2018My dad was one of the first foreign players to come to England,\u2019 Matavesi tells Sportsmail. He came over for the Fiji Barbarians in the late 1980s, and they played a World tour which finished in Cornwall.\n\nSam Matavesi (third left) is hoping to help spring a shock upset over Wales at the World Cup\n\n\u2018They played against Camborne and Redruth when those teams were in the top leagues. He went back to Fiji and got an offer to go to Cornwall again.\n\n\u2018So he went from being a coconut farmer in Fiji to working in Cornwall\u2019s tin mines!\n\n\u2018That was in 1987 - and he has been there ever since. He then had three kids with mum - three boys - me and Josh and one more Joel as well.\u2019\n\nTwo of those brothers are here in Japan representing Fiji at the World Cup - Sam, now 27, plays in the front row, and 29-year-old Josh is a fly-half.\n\nAnd Matavesi Jnr is hugely proud to play for the land of his father and his upbringing.\n\n\u2018When you grow up in Cornwall you are clearly English but massively Cornish too,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018You represent Cornwall, where we\u2019re from, and obviously Fiji now too.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been a long time out here. I\u2019m missing my family, but it\u2019s worth it.\n\n\u2018Hopefully it\u2019s not once in a lifetime, but if it is you want to make the most of the opportunity. To represent my country at a World Cup is amazing.\n\nThe 27-year-old grew up in Cornwall after his father moved to England in the 1980s\n\n\u2018At the last World Cup I watched three of the games - so to be here four years on is special.\n\n\u2018I went to England v Fiji at Twickenham, then Fiji\u2019s Wales and Australia games in Cardiff - so that was three of the four. It\u2019s really special.\u2019 Matavesi owes this to the Navy too. His day job is as a supply chain logistician at the Royal Naval Air Station in Culdrose near Helston.\n\n\u2018Luckily they have let me play in this World Cup - otherwise I\u2019d be on a ship somewhere!\u2019 Matavesi smiles.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been in the Navy for four years. On the air station I\u2019m part of the team that supports the aircraft. That could be from spares it needs, to fuel, to anything.\n\n\u2018I would be working every day if I wasn\u2019t here. I should be at sea right now!\u2019 But now Matavesi is in at the deep end at the World Cup, with Wales up next on Wednesday.\n\nSam is the brother of Josh Matavesi, who plays as the fly half for the Fiji national team\n\nIt has been a topsy-turvy tournament for Fiji where they have lost to unfancied Uruguay, and angry Australia but beat Georgia 45-10 on Thursday to set themselves up for a charge at Warren Gatland\u2019s side.\n\nAnd having grown up in England, Matavesi cannot wait.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve watched lots of England v Wales games in the Six Nations over the years.\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018They are a massive team, and it\u2019s going to be a massive test for us. If we can build Georgia it\u2019s going to be a good game.\n\nFiji got their World Cup campaign back on track after a thumping win over Georgia in Pool D\n\n\u2018Wales are so clinical and good at squeezing teams and making them play.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s international rugby. They\u2019re one of the best teams in the world. Even though Georgia was good for us, and it was good, we\u2019ve got to up it a lot next week if we want to perform against Wales.\n\n\u2018We have to respect them, but as Fijians we have to show what we can do.\n\n\u2018When we are confident and happy it works. We need to keep that the same.\n\n\u2018Fiji beat Wales at the World Cup in 2007. I watched that - who knows eh?\u2019", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN OTSU EXCLUSIVE: Sam Matavesi is the Fijian hooker with the Cornish accent who now is ready for a shot at Wales at the Rugby World Cup in Japan.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/19/19368412-0-image-a-126_1570388243707.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
