That sounds like a lot, sure, but it actually puts him almost $5 billion behind Gates on the list of world\u2019s richest people, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nJeff Bezos had previously stolen the crown from the Microsoft co-founder in October 2017, in what was then considered a bit of a shocking upset. Bill Gates has been the richest guy in the world in the public imagination for seemingly forever, or at least the \u2018mid 90s.\n\nSo what\u2019s with the drop? One year ago, Bezos was roughly $70 billion richer than anyone else on earth, including Gates.\n\nFirst off, Amazon is investing heavily in shaving a day off of their two-day Prime delivery, which isn\u2019t cheap. The costs of Amazon Prime\u2019s one-day delivery push will total $1.5 billion during the holiday quarter. These hefty costs seem to have left investors soured a bit on Amazon.\n\nSecondly, well, love ain\u2019t cheap, and neither is divorce. Bezos and his now ex MacKenzie announced their separation in January, and she received a quarter of Amazon holdings in July. As Bloomberg noted, as of Thursday MacKenzie Bezos\u2019s net worth dropped \u201cto $32.9 billion with Amazon shares priced at $1,637, and she remains the world\u2019s fourth-richest woman.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Microsoft stock has soared 38% this year, bringing Bill Gates\u2019 net worth up to $107.5 billion. Gates famously only has 1% stake in Microsoft, with the rest of his fortune made from investments and stock trading. It\u2019s also highly likely he never would have lost the top spot were it not for the more than $35 billion he\u2019s donated to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation since 1994.", "description": "The poor guy.", "authors": ["Michael Tedder"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uxD6W2plVDizKUe1Hyu6Tg--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/023e7b47ffdfa1155b43fdd78afd62d3", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
