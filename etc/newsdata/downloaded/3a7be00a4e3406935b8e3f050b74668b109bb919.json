We men were beaten to get our relatives to pay sums of money in exchange for our release,\" he said.\n\n\"I saw the organisers shoot two migrants who had tried to escape\".\n\nAnother said he was \"whipped by electrical wires. Other times I was beaten, even around the head.\"\n\nOne survivor described how the electric shocks \"made you fall to the ground unconscious\", adding that he had \"personally witnessed many murders by electric shock\".\n\nSome migrants died of hunger, according to another cited witness, who described seeing a jailer \"shoot a Nigerian in the legs for having taken a piece of bread\".\n\nLibya, despite being wracked by chaos and conflict since the 2011 uprising that killed the dictator Muammar Gadhafi, has remained a major transit route for migrants, especially from sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAccording to figures from the International Organization for Migration in July, at least 5 200 people are currently trapped in official detention centres in Libya, often in appalling conditions.", "description": "Italian police have arrested three people accused of the kidnap, torture and trafficking of migrants hoping to set sail from Libya to Europe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9269/1e4a30845e474615ae7cab5f53e513c4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
