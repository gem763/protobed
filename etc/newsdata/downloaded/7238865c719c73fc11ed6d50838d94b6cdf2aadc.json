He reportedly even re-tweeted a link to one of the articles that the reporter wrote using the information he had given to her.\n\n\u201cFrese was caught red-handed disclosing sensitive national security information for personal gain,\u201d said John Demers, the Assistant Attorney General of the National Security Division.\n\n\u201cThe unauthorized disclosure of TOP SECRET information could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave harm to the national security of the United States,\u201d the Justice Department said in a press release.\n\nFrese is the sixth individual to be charged with leaking to reporters or the public in the last two years.", "description": "A Defense Intelligence Agency employee was arrested\u00a0Wednesday for allegedly leaking information to reporters.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-618305844-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
