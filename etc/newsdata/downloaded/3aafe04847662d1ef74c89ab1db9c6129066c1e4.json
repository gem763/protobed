Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., could emerge as a strong \"compromise candidate.\"\n\n\"Can I present a scenario?\" Maher asked his guests during the show's panel segment. \"I think this might be one of those years where ... they can't get over that 'centrist' versus 'socialist' thing. So Elizabeth Warren at some point takes Bernie's voters, he drops out. It's Warren and Biden. And they go into the convention and it's deadlock. This has happened before in American politics and they need a compromise candidate.\"\n\nHe then pointed to Klobuchar as a viable option for Democrats in the general election against President Trump.\n\nMAHER MOCKS MSNBC'S 'NEVER TRUMPERS': THEY'RE 'VERY FAR LEFT' BECAUSE 'LOOK AT WHO'S GIVING THEM THEIR PAYCHECK'\n\n\"I'm looking hard at Amy Klobuchar,\" Maher said. \"You know why?

That moves a lot with the wokesters.\"\n\nGuest Krystal Ball of The Hill rejected Maher's argument, insisting a \"centrist\" would lead to another defeat for Democrats. She insisted that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., would beat Trump.\n\nMaher pushed back, saying, \"Even the centrists in the Democratic Party are pretty far left.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic strategist Fernand Amandi told Maher that a centrist is the wrong \"C-word\" and that it's actually \"charisma\" that matters most -- and stressed the Democratic candidate should have plenty of it.\n\n\"Well, we're f---ed then,\" Maher replied.", "description": "\"Real Time\" host\u00a0Bill Maher said Friday that Democrats could be heading toward\u00a0a contested 2020 convention and suggested that Sen.\u00a0Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., could emerge as a strong \"compromise candidate.\"", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
