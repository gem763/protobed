While Trump\u2019s core base of supporters remains solid, shifts in the demographic makeup of the electorate point to potentially serious challenges for Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nPut simply, America as a whole is becoming more diverse. Populations of racial and ethnic minorities are growing faster than Whites, and one of the fastest growing groups is those who identify as mixed race. Generally, racial and ethnic groups vote homogeneously, and any group sizably growing or shrinking will have an electoral impact on both parties.\n\nIn 2016, Pew Research conducted a survey examining the racial profile of Democratic and Republican voters. Republican voters were notably homogenous, with 86 percent identifying as white, 6 percent identifying as Hispanic, 5 percent as mixed race, and just 2 percent identifying as black. Democratic voters were markedly more diverse, with 57 percent identifying as white, 21 percent black, 12 percent Hispanic, 3 percent Asian, and 5 percent as mixed race.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn just four years, however, demographics have shifted, with the most substantive and consistent changes occurring within the Hispanic population, a particularly politicized group. Indeed, a record 32 million Hispanic voters will be eligible to vote next November, a number that has surged 20 percent since the 2016 election. The 2020 election will mark the first time that Hispanics constitute the largest voting minority, now accounting for just over 13 percent of eligible voters, according to a Pew 2019 survey.\n\nFurther, the U.S. Census projects that the American population is becoming increasingly diverse, and the only demographic group projected to decline in population is non-Hispanic whites, who are estimated to decrease from 62.2 percent in 2014, to 43.6 percent in 2016.\n\nThe Republican Party, and specifically President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, will experience the consequences of this demographic shift. This trend drastically limits the party\u2019s ability to grow its voting base and appeal to an increasingly diverse general election electorate, given Trump\u2019s stance on immigration and his hateful rhetoric towards minorities.\n\nMoreover, these national demographic shifts are even more pronounced in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Florida, which spells even greater electoral trouble for Trump. Notably, in Florida, where a constitutional amendment was recently passed restoring voting rights to over 1 million felons, the voting demographics of the state have fundamentally shifted in numerous ways.\n\nNow, the majority of the voting age population under 70 years of age are people of color, and minority groups have grown by 25 percent since 2010, according to Census population estimates released this summer. This figure likely also includes the over 300,000 Puerto Ricans that moved to Florida in the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Ultimately, in a crucial battleground state that Trump won by just 113,000 votes in 2016, the president\u2019s strategy of turning out his base will almost certainly not be enough to win the state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSimilarly, in Pennsylvania, many of these national trends hold true. The only racial group that decreased in population size in the commonwealth are non-Hispanic Whites. Since 2010, the Black population has grown 30 percent, and the Hispanic population has grown 35 percent, according to the Census Bureau and Penn State\u2019s Population Research Institute.\n\nThe Census Bureau also noted that the coal mining town of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, whose residents were 95 percent White in 2000, is now majority Latino, with Latinos comprising a striking 52 percent of the population. Pennsylvania is another critical swing state that President Trump won by a narrow vote margin in 2016. Given these notable demographic shifts, strategies that his campaign and the Republican Party successfully employed in 2016 will likely not produce the same result in 2020.\n\nTo achieve victory in 2020, President Trump will need to do more than aggressively pander to his base, and should focus on the sobering data which displays core demographic shifts that are simply not in his favor. To be sure, President Trump has proven to be adept at controlling the media narrative surrounding him, and I do not doubt that it will be difficult for Democrats to beat him in 2020.\n\nHowever, even if impeachment backfires on the Democrats politically, as I suspect it might, the realities Embedded in the data illustrate a serious uphill battle for Trump to win reelection in 2020.\n\nDouglas E.
