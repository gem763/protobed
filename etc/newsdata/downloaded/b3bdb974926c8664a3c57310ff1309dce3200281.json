I interviewed her about her partner\u2019s experiment with three different kinds of female condoms in 2016. \u201cI was going through my mother\u2019s drawers and I saw this flat rectangular-shaped pink and white packet with \u2018femidom\u2019 written on it.\u201d\n\nDanke was bewildered. She had seen a condom before, but this one was different, she tells me. Danke grew up in an unconventional home because of her mother\u2019s HIV activism during the late 1990s and early 2000s \u2013 when South Africa was engulfed by Aids denialism and stigma. She knew what a condom was in English and Setswana before her tenth birthday. But, even her radical home had its limits.\n\nMainly male condoms\n\nIt would take another 14 years before she used a female condom for the first time, which she found surprisingly pleasing. \u201cI have been curious as to how female condoms work, but not curious enough to try them out until now. In most places, you will only find male condoms.\u201d\n\nDanke\u2019s apprehension toward female condoms is one that sexual and reproductive justice activist and author Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng is all too familiar with. She says many women share Danke\u2019s sentiments and the size of female condoms can be intimidating.\n\nBut focusing on the \u201cpleasure element\u201d of sexual health could change this, Mofokeng says. \"We can't have a conversation with women about why the outer ring of a female condom is big. Yes, we acknowledge it's big, but do doctors tell women that the outer ring can rub on their clitoris during sex?\" Applying lubricant on the clitoris and female condom reduces dryness and sex becomes more pleasurable, she explains.\n\nThis will most likely result in a clitoral orgasm and another from internal vaginal stimulation. \"Which woman wouldn't want to have that? But we're not going to have those conversations if as medical practitioners, we are denying the fact that people are having sex for pleasure,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cIf you look around in South Africa, where has that message and got us? Nowhere.\" Mofokeng, who is also the lead consultant at Nalane for Reproductive Justice, believes sexual pleasure is an integral part of sexual and reproductive justice. She writes about the importance of the two in her recently released book Dr T: A Guide to Sexual Health and Pleasure.\n\nThe politics of pleasure\n\nFemale condoms are still an enigma for many South African women, despite the fact they could be the game-changer to more pleasurable sex and giving women more autonomy and power to negotiate safer sex. Heterosexual women often struggle to convince their sexual partners to use condoms \u2013 this can be exacerbated when they\u2019re in romantic relationships.\n\nA 2017 study published in the Global Health Action journal found that although women reported negotiating safe sex in their relationships, they feared the possible consequences of insisting on using condoms with their partners. To make matters worse, girls and young women are significantly more affected and infected by HIV.\n\nAccording to South Africa\u2019s latest HIV plan, girls and women between the ages of 15 and 24 have the highest rate of new infections. Despite this, male condoms are still more readily available than female condoms in public health facilities and a pack of two Cupid female condoms retails for about R40. This is because the cost of making one female condom is nine rands as compared to approximately 30 cents for one male condom.\n\nBut Mofokeng says it\u2019s more than just the numbers that make a difference, so does political will. \u201cThe main option available for safe sex is still the male condom which now comes in flavours. It\u2019s the same for contraception; there's no variety for women. Women are an afterthought and everything is still lopsided in terms of health solutions,\u201d she argues.\n\nCurrently, government has committed to distributing at least 850 million male condoms and 33 to 40 million female condoms \u2013 as stated in the latest strategic plan for HIV \u2013 a staggeringly low 5% of the number of male versions.\n\nDeclaration of sexual pleasure\n\nMofokeng says this deliberate disregard for young women \u2013 specifically young black women \u2013 is directly linked to ignoring their existence as people worthy of experiencing sexual pleasure. \u201cMost of the time people talk about sexual health and reproductive justice as if it have nothing to do with enjoying sex, even though the reason why we are all having sex is that it's enjoyable \u2013 it's because of the pleasure,\u201d she says.\n\nSexual pleasure is defined as \u201cthe physical and/or psychological satisfaction and enjoyment derived from shared or solitary erotic experiences, including thoughts, fantasies, dreams, emotions and feelings\u201d. This is according to the Declaration of Sexual Pleasure which was recently adopted at the 24th World Congress of the World Association for Sexual Health in Mexico City.\n\nThe declaration \u2013 adapted from the Global Advisory Board for Sexual Health and Wellbeing \u2013 acknowledges that sexual pleasure should be experienced within the context of sexual rights fundamentally based on equality and non-discrimination, autonomy and bodily integrity.\n\n\u201cThe experiences of human sexual pleasure are diverse and sexual rights ensure that pleasure is a positive experience for all concerned and not obtained by violating other people\u2019s human rights and wellbeing.\n\nA right that we all have\n\n\u201dBut there is a context in which black women are having sex South Africa, where cultural references and experiences, religious influences and societal pressures play a part. She explains: \"We see black women in two lenses: they must not get pregnant and they must not get HIV. We have the mentality that \u2018if only black women could behave, the world would be much better\u2019.\n\n\"From the time we are children, before we\u2019re even aware of it, there's a certain way that we are raised to see our bodies. Who we think sex is for is already predetermined for us. I'm hoping the book helps people learn that, in fact, sexual pleasure is a right that we all have.\"\n\n\n\nThe book, Mofokeng says, is an extension of her sexual reproductive justice activism, which is about giving people information and promoting better health outcomes. Medicine and South Africa's sexual health policies have left pleasure out of sexual health and the prevention for STIs, HIV and pregnancy.\n\nShe says: \u201cThe messaging around sex and sexuality in the mainstream is problematic because if you are not a young woman who is concerned about HIV or pregnancy, there's nothing else in the system that speaks for you or to you \u2013 as if that's all you are.\u201d\n\n*Name changed to protect identity\n\n\u2013 Health-e News\n\nImage credit: unsplash.com", "description": "Female condoms could be a game-changer for more pleasurable sex and give women more autonomy and power to negotiate safer sex, says the leader of the #pleasurerevolution Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng.", "authors": ["Pontsho Pilane"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9384/d2d69fe31c7b487d88f70b4b4331c4b4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
