It will be interesting to see if they can, but I don\u2019t know if he will be a good enough signing for United.\"\n\nMaddison has so far provided two goals and two assists in seven Premier League appearances this season for Leicester.\n\nHe was called into the latest England squad by Gareth Southgate, but had to withdraw due to illness before being spotted in a casino on the night of the Three Lions' match with Czech Republic.\n\n(Image: Leicester City FC via Getty Imag)\n\nThe former Norwich man is just one of a number of stars United are believed to be targeting, including Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic and Napoli defender Khalidou Koulibaly.\n\nAnd Kleberson feels these players are more of the calibre that United should be looking to attract.\n\n\"When you sign big players like Mandzukic, you can see the impact they bring into the club, not just on the pitch but also off the pitch,\" he added.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"They bring experience for the young players which helps to improve them as they grow into their careers.\n\n\"Koulibaly looks athletic and physical which will bring more energy in the defence.\n\n\"[Harry] Maguire is a big name in England, but it would be good for United to look outside of the Premier League to find players who could play for them.\"", "description": "The Leicester and England midfielder has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford after good form this season", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Getty Images", "Leicester City Fc Via Getty Imag"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20647833.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-FC-v-Leicester-City-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
