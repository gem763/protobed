He left most of his fortune in a fund to launch the awards, which were first presented in 1901.\n\nIn 1968, an economic sciences prize was added by Sweden's central bank, although it does not count as a Nobel Prize.\n\nWho are some of the most famous winners?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Barack Obama (right) with his Nobel Peace Prize alongside Thorbjoern Jagland, of Norway's Nobel Committee\n\nFormer US President Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, for \"his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples\".\n\nPresident Obama said he was \"surprised and deeply humbled\" and would use it as a \"call to action\". However, there was criticism of his award, especially as he had been in office for only 12 days before the nomination deadline.\n\nOther notable Nobel Peace Prize winners include former US President Jimmy Carter (2002), child education activist Malala Yousafzai (shared 2014), the European Union (2012), the United Nations and its then-general-secretary, Kofi Annan, (shared 2001) and Saint Teresa of Calcutta (1979).\n\nAlbert Einstein (physics 1921),Marie Curie (physics 1903 and chemistry 1911), and Harold Pinter (literature 2005) have also received Nobel Prizes.\n\nTwo people - author and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in 1964 and Vietnamese politician Le Duc Tho in 1973 - rejected the prize, and four others were forced to decline by their countries.\n\nIn 2016, there was uncertainty over whether singer Bob Dylan would accept the literature award before he finally delivered his lecture for the prize in June.\n\nBBC Nobel Prize in numbers Statistics from 1901 to 2018 935 Nobel Laureates (908 people, 27 organisations)\n\n17 Age of youngest winner - education activist Malala Yousafzai\n\n96 Age of oldest winner - scientist Arthur Ashkin\n\n52 Prizes won by women\n\n6People who declined an award Source: Nobel Prize website\n\nWho will win this year's Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nShort answer - nobody knows.\n\nUnder the Nobel Foundation's rules, nomination shortlists are not allowed to be published for 50 years. The organisation says any talk of who is the favourite to win a prize is \"sheer guesswork\".\n\nWe only know Ms Thunberg is a nominee because the three Norwegian MPs who nominated her publicised their decision. However, it is not known if the nomination was in time for this year's award.\n\nThere have been reports US President Donald Trump has also been nominated but there is concern the entry may have been falsified.\n\nOther names who are said to be in the running include Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, and indigenous Brazilian leader Raoni Metuktire.\n\nThe only concrete information is 301 candidates have been nominated for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize - 223 individuals and 78 organisations - the fourth highest number in history.\n\nHow does the Nobel Prize work?\n\nDifferent organisations award the prize in each category every year. Five of the six are chosen in Sweden, while the Nobel Peace Prize is selected in Norway.\n\nAcademics, university professors, scientists, previous winners and others all submit nominations.\n\nPrize winners are called laureates, to signify the laurel wreath given to victors of contests in ancient Greece.\n\nMore than one, but no more than three, people can win each prize.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How do you choose a Nobel Prize winner?\n\nThere have been some years when the prize has not been awarded - mostly during the two world wars.\n\nAnd Nobel Foundation rules state if nobody deserves the prize in a particular category, it is not awarded and its prize money is kept for the following year.\n\nWhat do the winners receive?\n\nThe recipient of each prize receives three things:\n\na Nobel diploma, each of which is a unique work of art\n\na Nobel medal, which have some differing designs\n\na cash prize of 9m Swedish krona (\u00a3741,000) - which is split between winners when there is more than one. They have to deliver a lecture to receive the money\n\nThe prizes are presented at ceremonies on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, in Stockholm and Oslo.\n\nWhat have some prize winners bought with their winnings?\n\nMarie and Pierre Curie used their physics prize money in 1903 for further scientific research, and 2006 physics winner John Mather donated his cash to his foundation.\n\nIn 1993, British biochemist Richard Roberts spent his medicine winnings on a croquet lawn and fellow 1993 laureate Phillip Sharp bought a 100-year-old Federal-style house. The 2001 medicine winner, Sir Paul Nurse, bought himself a high-end motorbike.\n\nMeanwhile, 2006 literature laureate Orhan Pamuk established a museum in Istanbul.\n\nWho are the 2019 winners so far?", "description": "Greta Thunberg is a nominee for the 100th Nobel Peace Prize, with the winner being announced on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4D4D/production/_109098791_gretathunberggetty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
