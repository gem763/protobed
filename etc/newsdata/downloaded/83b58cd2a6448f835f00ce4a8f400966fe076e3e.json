It said in a statement issued in New York that it was \u201cdeeply alarmed to hear of the family being held in inhumane conditions on a farmhouse in the Netherlands\u201d.\n\nIt said it could confirm that Van Dorsten \u201cwas briefly a member of our movement in the mid-1980s\u201d but had left in 1987. He was \u201cknown to have mental health issues\u201d and his brother had not heard from him for over 30 years, it said, adding that there were no records indicating Brunner had ever been associated with the movement.\n\nA local TV station, RTV Drenthe, had earlier reported that the Austrian was a member of the church, which was where the two men had met. The broadcaster also reported that the siblings had been moved from a holiday park where they were taken after other guests had seen them performing cult rituals, such as walking in circles.\n\nThree people who say they are also Van Dorsten\u2019s children have come forward to say they left the family eight years ago and had heard no news of the others since. Neighbours told Dutch media they had assumed he had moved to South Korea, where the movement was founded, or died. He did not attend his mother\u2019s funeral, one said.\n\nWillem Koetsier, a church member in Amsterdam, told the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper that after van Dorsten had left the movement he had gone to Germany where \u201cwe lost sight of him\u201d. He said he believed the father \u201ctogether with someone else\u201d had since started their own cult.\n\nVan Dorsten was was active in the movement in Germany and Austria and later married an Austrian woman, Koetsier told the paper. \u201cI have heard from older members that he was a very spiritual person and set up a group with his family,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes people who are spiritual start their own church or movement. I think this is the case with him. It could be that he thought he had a special mission.\u201d\n\nBrunner\u2019s brother said separately that the Austrian had previously been in a cult after leaving military service, although he did not say which group. \u201cHe was in a sect,\u201d the brother told the Kronen Zeitung newspaper. \u201cWe\u2019ve had no contact with him for 10 years. I told him to get lost when he wanted me to become his financial guarantor.\u201d", "description": "Dutch media report that 67-year-old was former member of movement known as Moonies", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cf567659db92ff8e4d4add1cd71b69142469094/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=647dc547d7a4ff362650866a98d02f25", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
