Or at least it will be once surf legend Kelly Slater brings his Surf Ranch to Coolum Beach on Queensland\u2019s Sunshine Coast.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what a Kelly Slater Surf Ranch is, the first (and until now) only one in existence is chilling in California. Because of course it is. Basically, it\u2019s an artificial lake that uses a system of hydrofoils to create the perfect (man-made) wave to hang 10 on. It\u2019s also 100% solar powered.\n\nAs someone who may have grown up on the Central Coast surrounded by beaches but only learned to surf when living in Canada at the local wave pool with no ocean in sight \u2013 let me just say that artificial waves are awesome!\n\nThe Cali ranch can create waves up to 6.5 feet, but the beauty is they can be adjusted to beginner and intermediate levels. It\u2019s a buttload easier to learn to surf when you know exactly what type of wave is coming.\n\nThe Sunny Coast will be the site of the second Surf Ranch in the world, apparently to escape the slowdown in California during the winter months.\n\nREAD MORE Get Ready To Sink Some Beers And Pat Some Good Bois At Brisbane\u2019s Puppies And Pints Event\n\nThe whole thing is costing a ridiculously large $100 million to build. While part of that is obviously being spent on the waves, the facility will also feature an eco-lodge and spots for events. Do I smell freshwater surf comps? Yes, I do.\n\nIt sounds COOL guys! There are no dates yet, so maybe just go watch Blue Crush again and get inspired.", "description": "Kelly Slater is setting up the new branch of his famous Californian artificial wave Surf Ranch on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland.", "authors": ["Kassia Byrnes"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/kelly-slater-surf-ranch-qld-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
