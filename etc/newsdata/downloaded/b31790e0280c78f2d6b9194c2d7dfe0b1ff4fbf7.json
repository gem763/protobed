The families also attempted to develop a Trump Tower Moscow together.\n\nEmin, 39, is due to embark on a tour in February 2020 with stops in cities across the U.S. and Canada but he has recently learned that following complaints from members of the public about his relationship with President Trump, he has been dropped by some venues.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the Wilshire Ebell Theatre pulled out and in Toronto, the Convention Centre also decided to cancel his show, according to Emin's team.\n\nMichael O'Connor, general manager of the Wilshire Ebell, did not respond to a request for comment from DailyMailTV.\n\nThe Toronto Convention Center did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRussian pop star Emin Agalarov claims North American concert venues have canceled his concerts due to his ties with President Trump\n\nEmin and his pro-Putin billionaire father Aras Agalarov (pictured far right at the 2013 Miss Universe Pageant in Moscow) have a longstanding friendship with the Trumps\n\nThe singer had to pull his American tour dates earlier this year after he failed to receive reassurances from Special Counsel Robert Mueller who was investigating his links to President Trump\n\nNew York Town Hall also reportedly received complaints but staff told callers that it is a free country and everyone has the right to perform there. Town Hall did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a statement to DailyMailTV, Emin said: 'I am looking forward to performing in the land of the free, a country founded on free speech and liberty.\n\n'I am pleased that the New York Town Hall show is going ahead and can't wait to play there for my fans on the East Coast.\n\n'I grew up in the US and love the country and am surprised that some venues felt they couldn't accommodate me. That is their prerogative but it's misguided.\n\n'It's crazy to say a singer cannot perform in a certain venue just because he or she has once done some business with your President.\n\n'I have always believed that music can unite nations and people and I know my concerts will bring those of all cultures together.'\n\nOne source said: 'He's victim of Trump derangement syndrome.'\n\nEmin had announced in August that he would be returning to America for the first time since avoiding criminal charges in Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nThe singer pulled his American tour dates earlier this year after he failed to receive reassurances from the Special Counsel who was investigating his links to Trump as part of the wider inquiry.\n\nEmin and his father Aras (pictured left) have also been named as defendants in a multimillion-dollar federal lawsuit filed by the Democratic National Committee claiming they were part of a plot to disrupt the 2016 presidential campaign and propel Trump to the White House\n\nOngoing friendship: Emin (left) caught up with Ivanka Trump and her father in Florida in March 2014 as they continued their relationship\n\nEmin asked his British-born impresario Rob Goldstone (circled) to set up a meeting with the Trump campaign, and told DailyMailTV that Goldstone used hyperbole to get the Trumps' attention, agreeing that it was a 'stunt'\n\nEmin brokered the Trump Tower meeting in June 2016, where key Trump team figures including Don Jr, Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, met with Russians promising 'dirt' on presidential candidate Hillary Clinton .\n\nMueller's nearly two-year investigation charged 34 individuals and resulted in seven guilty pleas. No further indictments were recommended in the final report, which was released in April.\n\nEmin has also been named as a defendant in a multimillion-dollar federal lawsuit filed by the Democratic National Committee, along with his father Aras.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in April 2018, against the Russian government, the Trump campaign and Wikileaks alleges a conspiracy to disrupt the 2016 presidential campaign and propel Trump to the White House.\n\nAs part of his extended Good Love World Tour, Emin will perform in Toronto, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles in February 2020.\n\nThe singer will also play the UK, Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany and Israel, along with his native Russia and Azerbaijan, during the 26-date tour.\n\nBorn in Azerbaijan, Emin was raised in Russia before moving to New Jersey as a teen and discovering his love of Elvis Presley. He has sold over one million records in his native Russia.\n\nIn interview with DailyMailTV last year, Emin said he wasn't aware of any business meetings that took place at Moscow's Ritz-Carlton Hotel during Trump's trip\n\nThis year he released his album Good Love, which featured the hit single, Got Me Good.\n\nIn the video, he mocks his relationship with Trump, and sings alongside lookalikes of Trump, Hillary Clinton, Stormy Daniels, Kim Jong-un, Mark Zuckerberg and Ivanka Trump. The real Trump also stars in the clip.\n\nOn July 24, Mueller testified before house committees about his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and any possible obstruction of justice by the president. In his opening remarks, Mueller said that the investigation 'found that the Russian government interfered in our election in sweeping and systematic fashion'.\n\nIn January 2017, a leaked, unverified dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele claimed that Russian officials had compromising information on Trump that could be used to blackmail him.\n\nThis allegedly included a video, made secretly at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Moscow, where Trump paid 'a number of prostitutes to perform a golden showers (urination) show in front of him' on the bed where President Obama and First Lady Michelle had once slept during a state trip, because he 'hated' them.\n\nRepublican committee members pressed Mueller on the so-called Steele dossier but he declined to answer their questions.\n\n'This is under investigation elsewhere in the Justice Department and consequently it is not within my purview ... others are investigating,' Mueller said.\n\nCleared: Emin Agalarov was caught up in Robert Mueller's special counsel inquiry because he brokered the meeting in Trump Tower which saw Don Jr. say of an offer of 'dirt' on Hillary Clinton: 'I love it.'\n\nIn an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV in Moscow last year, Emin addressed the 'golden shower' allegations \u2013 which Trump has denied.\n\nEmin told DailyMailTV in December: 'I heard the rumor but I was with him at all the meetings and I haven't heard anything like that.\n\n'I don't think anyone would offer that because Mr Trump has traveled here with 87 most beautiful women of 2013 - Miss UK, Miss America, Miss Brazil, Miss Russia.\n\n'There were 87 of them and that's a lot. So I don't think anybody would have the guts to offer anything else.'\n\nKeith Schiller, Trump's bodyguard at the time, testified to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that during one meeting that trip, someone offered to send five women to Trump's hotel room.\n\nSchiller said he viewed it as a joke, rejected the suggestion and when he told Trump about it, they laughed over it.\n\nEmin said he wasn't aware of any business meetings that took place at Moscow's Ritz-Carlton Hotel during Trump's trip - only the filming of his music video, In Another Life, which Trump agreed to star in, to deliver his Apprentice catchphrase: 'You're fired.'\n\nEmin's father, Aras Agalarov is worth a reported $1.6 billion. He founded the Crocus Group, a real-estate, entertainment and retail behemoth in Russia, which develops projects from luxury malls to concert arenas and World Cup soccer stadiums. He has received the Order of Honor state medal from Putin in a ceremony at the Kremlin for his work.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Bell, an independent media outlet in Russia which operates outside of state control, Aras Agalarov addressed the multimillion-dollar federal lawsuit filed by the DNC against him and his son.\n\nAras said today: 'My lawyer says that we will be paid by them for legal and lawyers' expenses.\n\n'They have not just proof but even a hint of proof. It is unclear what do I have to do with this gibberish.'", "description": "Russian pop star Emin Agalarov, 39, claims he has been barred from performing at major concert venues in North America due to his relationship with President Trump.", "authors": ["Louise Boyle In New York For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/19/19592598-0-image-a-8_1570820398158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
