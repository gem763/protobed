They had to cut me open and use some rib, some cartilage and some bone from my rib to make my nose!\"\n\n(Image: anthonyogogo11/Instagram)\n\n(Image: anthonyogogo11/Instagram)\n\nAfter the injuries sustained in the fight with Cunningham, which was Ogogo's first ever pro defeat, he was registered as blind and lost his driving license, and said that his eye \"basically exploded.\"\n\nFollowing his retirement in March Ogogo released a long, emotional statement, which finished with the words: \"I\u2019ve been through a lot in my career. I\u2019ve had 17 operations and suffered every pain imaginable. I\u2019ve won, lost, cried and hurt. But if you were to ask me would I do it again? In a heartbeat. I love this game.\"", "description": "The retired boxer suffered a series of serious injuries during his final fight against Craig Cunningham in 2016", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20464304.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Anthony-Ogogo-v-Craig-Cunningham-WBC-International-Middleweight-Title.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
