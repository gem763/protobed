According to an ABC News analysis, $932,146,000 of $1,763,245 is pulled from 31 projects in Democratic congressional districts.\n\nThirty-four other projects in Republican congressional districts total $831,099,000 in deferred money for the border wall -- $101,047,000 less than Democrats -- though Republicans have three more projects being deferred than Democrats.\n\nThe three affected territories are Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The more than $400 million of deferred funding from Puerto Rico was earmarked for Hurricane Maria reconstruction of U.S. military facilities, as was $23.5 million from U.S. Virgin Islands projects.\n\nA senior defense official told reporters that the administration is committed to the Puerto Rico recovery, but explained that the earliest award date for the affected projects in Puerto Rico is September 2020.\n\n\"We think you are not going to be delayed because of how far out into the future they are in the meantime,\" the official said. \"We did continue with all the cleanup work from that horrible storm.\"\n\nThere are nine school projects affected: six overseas and three stateside. Only one of those projects was for a new school, while the rest was designated for renovations or refurbishing existing buildings.\n\n(MORE: Trump declares national emergency to get border wall funding)\n\nThe senior defense official said that the administration is in discussions with Congress to recover the $3.6 billion that has been reprogrammed for the 175 miles of wall.
