There had been no live sightings of this whale so the first time anyone was aware was when it was found dead.\n\n\u201cIt may have been dead for some days.

He added that it was \u201ccurious\u201d to get two deaths so close together but said there was no obvious cause of death.\n\nPreviously listed as endangered, fin whale numbers have roughly doubled since the 1970s when an international ban on commercial whaling was introduced. The population now stands at 100,000 mature individuals and they are the second largest mammal in the world after blue whales.\n\nThey are generally found off the Gulf of California, the Coral Triangle and the Arctic.\n\nThe discovery comes just 10 days after a humpback whale died after swimming into the Thames.\n\nIt was spotted surfacing in the river but was then found dead near Greenhithe, Kent, not long after.\n\nThe Zoological Society of London confirmed that young female \u2013 nicknamed Hessy \u2013 had been hit by a ship.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

However, Hessy was the fifth humpback to be recorded stranded in the UK so far this year.\n\nTwo others recorded in the Thames and wider Thames estuary region in 2009 and 2013 both died.\n\nLast year, Benny the Beluga whale caught the public\u2019s attention after he was seen feeding in the Thames. It is thought he finally left the area.", "description": "A dead whale has been found in the river Thames less than two weeks after a humpback whale nicknamed Hessy died in the same stretch of water.\u00a0 The whale was found near Town Pier in Gravesend at\u00a09am\u00a0on Friday morning and early indications suggest the\u00a032ft-long\u00a0animal is a rare fin whale.
