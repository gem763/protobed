White House officials have said they will not comply with House investigators and Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nJoe Biden leads in most opinion polls in the Democratic primary and most polls in a hypothetical match-up between him and Trump in the 2020 election.", "description": "Son of Democratic presidential hopeful has faced numerous unsubstantiated attacks from Donald Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/13/c580db8fe9e14acba85ebe8b6bbd5fdd_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
