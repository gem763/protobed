The Packers scored just 10 points in Week 1 against the Chicago Bears, and they were held scoreless in the second half on Sunday against the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nBut it\u2019s added up to a 2-0 start with each win coming against a division rival. They\u2019ll take it.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nEven so, the offense has sputtered at times, renewing concerns that Rodgers \u2014 a seven-time Pro Bowler, Super Bowl champion and two-time MVP who famously clashed with former coach Mike McCarthy \u2014 and LaFleur \u2014 a 39-year-old first-time head coach \u2014 might not see eye to eye.\n\nRodgers publicly questioned LaFleur in the preseason before blaming media for reporting on what he said \u2014 a tactic he previously used to attack reports of dysfunction between himself and McCarthy.\n\nAnd on Sunday, he was seen arguing with LaFleur on the sideline after a three-and-out to end the first half.\n\n#Packers\u2019 Aaron Rodgers and head coach Matt LaFleur.

He\u2019s just a, as am I, we\u2019re a little animated at times. I can\u2019t say we were yelling how much we love each other, but we definitely weren\u2019t MF\u2019ing each other or anything. It was talking about the look there and getting on the same page.\u201d\n\nA disagreement like the one Aaron Rodgers and Matt LaFleur had on Sunday is easy to downplay after a 2-0 start. (AP)\n\nLaFleur verified Rodgers\u2019 account of the interaction.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just two competitive guys, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not going to be the last one we have,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cBut you know, just competitors, heat of the moment and it is what it is. I would much rather have that than anything else because you want guys that are extreme competitors and that\u2019s what he is.\u201d\n\nSo there you have it. Nothing to see here.\n\nQuarterbacks and coaches at this level should be expected to disagree at times, and Sunday\u2019s squabble shouldn\u2019t raise any yellow flags about the pair\u2019s relationship.\n\nBut it\u2019s easy to blow something like that off after a 2-0 start. This is a relationship that will be scrutinized all season. How the pair\u2019s disagreements play out if and when the Packers hit a down stretch will prove a more accurate barometer of the weather in Green Bay.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "A disagreement like the one Aaron Rodgers and Matt LaFleur had on Sunday is easy to downplay after a 2-0 start.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/acx9tcMtw53GTCRvGfwIEg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NDMuNzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9F9aazkZ1LAHErgLklCU9A--~B/aD0xOTIzO3c9MjkxODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/04283240-d82a-11e9-afd5-143ed1b3445d", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
