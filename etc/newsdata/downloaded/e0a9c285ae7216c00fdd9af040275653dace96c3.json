I felt like I did that.\u201d\n\nFavorite to defend his title, Jamaican McLeod came out of the starting blocks fast but his race quickly turned sour as he knocked down hurdles and tumbled to the track before reaching the finish line.\n\nMcLeod\u2019s problems seemed to upset Diamond League champion Orlando Ortega in the next lane and he finished fifth in 13.30 seconds.\n\nMcLeod said he had felt a hamstring strain in the warm-up and thought it would go away.\n\n\u201cI was ready to go, I showed up ready,\u201d McLeod said. \u201cI put myself in the very best situation to defend my title.\u201d\n\nCapitalizing on McLeod\u2019s fall, Shubenkov, the 2015 world champion, took his second consecutive world silver with a technically sound run of 13.15 seconds.\n\nHolloway and Shubenkov said they had not no idea that chaos was unfolding in neighboring lanes.\n\n\u201cIn the replay I saw that one fell down... another was celebrating,\u201d said Shubenkov. \u201cI thought to myself \u2018I missed everything\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe Russian secured a third medal for the authorized neutral athletes after golds in the women\u2019s pole vault and high jump this week.\n\nLike all other Russians competing in Doha, Shubenkov cannot wear his national colors and brandish the Russian flag during his celebratory lap because the country\u2019s athletics federation remains suspended following a doping scandal.\n\nThe bronze medal went to European champion Pascal Martinot-Lagarde, who finished 0.03 seconds behind Shubenkov to give France its second medal of the world championships.\n\n\u201cI was the one who stayed on my feet,\u201d Martinot-Lagarde said. \u201cIt\u2019s the medal of self-control. It\u2019s the medal of the guy who stayed focused.\u201d", "description": "Grant Holloway of the United States blazed to his first 110 meters hurdles world title on Wednesday in a dramatic race in which defending champion Omar McLeod fell.", "authors": ["Gabrielle T\u00e9trault-Farber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436388584&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911R1-OCASP"}
