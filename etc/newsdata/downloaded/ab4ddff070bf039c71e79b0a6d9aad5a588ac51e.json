It held the Hawkeyes to two field goals early on when it did get close and forced another miss.\n\nAnd that defense came up with the would-be, game-turning play midway through the third quarter, recovering a fumble inside the 20 yard line.\n\nBut, in the end, it would be the true freshman tailback who helped save this most critical victory in Iowa's Kinnick Stadium.\n\nWhile this highly-rated defense clamped down on the Hawkeyes in their house, tailback Noah Cain sled-dogged the hardest yards on the Penn State's final two drives in the 17-12 victory Saturday night.\n\nPenn State wide receiver KJ Hamler (1) celebrates with teammates after a touchdown catch against Iowa at Kinnick Stadium.

They overturned a TD catch-and-run by tight end Pat Freiermuth's, saying his knee was down on the 1 yard line \u2014 before he stretched the ball into the end zone.\n\nThe overturn seemed surprising, even questioned at length by the ABC TV announcing crew.\n\nPenn State settled for a field goal to lead 10-6 after three quarters.\n\nThis Penn State TD was overturned and Freiermuth was ruled down at the 1.@HawkeyeFootball took advantage and held them to 3: pic.twitter.com/bHcVGFHMTI \u2014 Big Ten Network (@BigTenNetwork) October 13, 2019\n\nNo matter, the night belonged to Penn State's defense. It helped make up for the shakiest of efforts by the other side of the ball.\n\nThe defense held its ground despite a few unfortunate slips early on and appeared to get stronger as the game wore on.\n\nThey appeared to have Iowa locked down in the final minutes of the first half after a huge sack. But the Hawkeyes were rescued by a downfield holding penalty on senior cornerback John Reid.\n\nSoon after, fellow corner Tariq Castro-Fields stumbled in pass coverage, allowing a Hawk receiver to beat him for a huge catch inside.\n\nThat stand helped hold up arguably Penn State's top offensive play of the night. Quarterback Sean Clifford fired quick to KJ Hamler on the right side and the firecracker receiver did the rest. He flew to the sideline, sprinted and then leaped for the end zone.\n\nThat play was reviewed, too, but stood.\n\nThe Lions led 7-3.\n\nAnd yet for all of its defensive prowess, the Lions were fired in the fourth quarter by its running game.\n\nKey decisions by Clifford to pull it down and run earned a couple of first downs. And rugged running of Cain put his stamp on the starting spot, once again, by pulling the offense along late.\n\nHe gained 102 yards on 22 carries, most of it when it mattered most, and scored the killer touchdown with five minutes to play.\n\nThe hard-fought victory was huge for Top 10 Penn State before returning home for its annual white out game with Michigan.\n\nIt also was coach James Franklin's first victory in seven tries against ranked teams on the road during his time at Penn State.", "description": "The highly-ranked Penn State defense shut down Iowa in the second half on the road to key a huge victory as the Nittany Lions stayed unbeaten.", "authors": ["Frank Bodani", "Published P.M.
