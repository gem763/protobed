There too, the place is lit with lamps and people celebrate the triumph of light over darkness. In Nepalese Hinduism the second day of the five day festival is known as Kukar Tihar and it is dedicated to worshipping dogs.\n\nIt's Kukur Tihar today, and they will be worshipping and celebrating man's best friend in Nepal and many parts of North Bengal.

In Hindu mythology a dog is considered to guard the gates of afterlife. Even if you keep the tradition aside, we know from experience that having dogs as pets and companions is one of the most fulfilling things ever. They are loyal, sensitive to our emotions and only expect affection and love in return. For all this and much more, they deserve a day in the year especially dedicated to them.\n\nDuring Kukar Tihar, dogs, pets and strays are garlanded and a tika (red mark) is applied on their forehead and they are all treated with food. When Joy Bhattacharjya tweeted about the festival, here's how people reacted.\n\nDon't Miss 395 SHARES 666 SHARES\n\nHere you are - our Indies pic.twitter.com/NkOj7yhGnb \u2014 Nandini \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 (@NAN_DINI_) October 27, 2019\n\nIn that case its kukur tihar everyday at my place. pic.twitter.com/uldUadis44 \u2014 Subhrajit Mukherjee (@sunnym1979) October 27, 2019\n\nBah ...khub sundor...jantam na...In this God Dog world , I would say the dog deserves a day for being Man's best friend \u2014 CA Bharathy Easwar (@Bse02189763) October 27, 2019\n\nDogs are God\u2019s children (Katez with parkies in Cubbon Park today) pic.twitter.com/YbNxf64N4K \u2014 Ranjeet Kate (@katranjeet) October 27, 2019\n\nGood to know,nowhere in world we celebrate companionship of dogs,it should spread. \u2014 AR (@OneandOnlyIndie) October 27, 2019\n\nHere's hoping we are kinder to animals as another festival falls on the same day as Kukur Tihar. #HappyDiwali and #KukurTihar \u2014 Priyangshu Gogoi (@PriyangshuG) October 27, 2019\n\n100 times better than all the frauds who are worshipped & venerated...Wag your tail in agreement pic.twitter.com/PRaiHLJI0f \u2014 Anupam Vaid (@VaidAnupam) October 27, 2019\n\nDon\u2019t have the pic of my dog but we get her garlanded and forehead marked, whenever we take her to the temple. \u2014 Aakash Bagga (@aakashbagga) October 27, 2019\n\nI\u2019m in Canada and had never heard of this so thank you so much for posting this, Joy!
