But he eventually agreed to the photo shoot, setting in motion an emotional moment \u2014 except unbeknownst to him, it would be between him and his best man, Mitchell Applin.\n\nApplin \"is a constant friend for the both of us,\" said Abbott, now Bridgette Kenny, explaining he was game for surprising Mark.\n\nActually finding a dress for Applin's six-foot-six frame was another story \u2014 the dress shop had only one he could squeeze into. \"It didn't fit perfect, obviously,\" Applin said with a laugh.\n\nThe moment\n\nAfter weeks of scheming, which required getting family on board and even printing a fake wedding schedule, Applin described feeling apprehensive as he crept behind Mark just before Saturday's ceremony, waiting for the photographer's cue.\n\n\"There was a little bit of nervousness in me,\" he said. \"I was like, 'This is going to break his heart when he turns around and sees that it's me.'\"\n\nBridgette harboured the same concerns.\n\n\"[Mark] was telling everyone, 'Me and Bridgette are going to have a first look, and I think it's going to be really important and special to us,'\" she said.\n\n\"And in the back of my mind I knew it wasn't really going to happen.
