Two new missions \u2014 from military contractor Northrop Grumman and a startup called Astroscale \u2014 will send spacecraft into orbit to rendezvous with other vehicles zooming around Earth to see if it\u2019s possible for two satellites to delicately meet up with each other in space. If successful, these missions could mark a big first step toward cleaning up Earth orbit and making it a more sustainable place.\n\nNorthrop Grumman and Astroscale are trying to prove out a concept known as satellite servicing, which isn\u2019t an option for satellite operators right now. Whenever an operator launches a satellite into orbit, there\u2019s really no way to reach that satellite again. It\u2019s all on its own out in space. So if a satellite runs out of propellant, you can\u2019t refill the tank. Operators have to take the vehicle out of orbit and then replace it with another multimillion-dollar vehicle. Or if a satellite breaks, it\u2019ll simply remain in space as an uncooperative piece of junk that could pose a threat to other satellites nearby.\n\nWhenever an operator launches a satellite into orbit, there\u2019s really no way to reach that satellite again\n\nDesigning a spacecraft that can catch up to and dock with a broken satellite is no easy feat. For one thing, these satellites are zooming overhead at thousands of miles per hour, making them difficult to approach. Additionally, practically all of the satellites that have been sent into space weren\u2019t designed to be caught and repaired. They don\u2019t have appendages for spacecraft to latch on to, so satellite servicing vehicles will have to come up with creative ways to grapple a satellite that\u2019s run out of fuel. And if a satellite suffered some kind of catastrophic failure, it\u2019s possible it broke into pieces, making it even harder to grab.\n\nNext year\u2019s missions will test out two different ways that servicing satellites can grab on to a spacecraft. One will use a robotic mechanism to latch on to an existing satellite, while the other will test out magnetic plates that could allow two satellites to easily snap together. Both methods could prove useful, but first, the teams need to show that they can work.\n\nNorthrop Grumman\n\nNorthrop Grumman\u2019s satellite servicing mission is already underway. On October 9th, a Russian Proton rocket launched the company\u2019s MEV 1 spacecraft, the first mission to test out satellite servicing capabilities while in space. \u201cWe believe it is the first commercial [satellite servicing] mission to do rendezvous and docking,\u201d Joseph Anderson, vice president of business development and operations at Space Logistics, a division of Northrop Grumman, tells The Verge.\n\nThe MEV 1 spacecraft has a very specific task: latch on to a satellite already in orbit. The vehicle\u2019s target is a communications satellite called Intelsat 901, which circulates about 22,000 miles above Earth. Launched in 2001, Intelsat 901 has already had a long, productive mission, but the satellite is running low on propellant and ground operators won\u2019t be able to control the spacecraft for much longer.\n\nMEV 1 will try to change that. In late January of next year, the spacecraft will slowly approach Intelsat 901. When the two are in just the right position, MEV 1 will use a device to grab hold of Intelsat 901\u2019s engine. That device will pull the two satellites close so that they\u2019re practically right on top of each other. With the two vehicles acting as one, MEV 1 will then ignite its own engine and place Intelsat 901 in a new orbit so that the satellite can continue working.\n\nMEV 1 will stay attached to Intelsat 901 for at least five years, extending the lifetime of the aging satellite. \u201cThey are low on fuel; they are not empty, but they are low on fuel,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cThey could not go the extra five years if we didn\u2019t have this flight.\u201d It\u2019s possible MEV 1 could stay attached even longer if Intelsat enjoys the service enough. But once Intelsat determines that the satellite\u2019s time is up, MEV 1 will place the vehicle into what is known as a graveyard orbit \u2014 a region of space where non-functioning satellites are placed after they\u2019ve used up all their fuel. In the graveyard orbit, they won\u2019t interfere with other operational satellites.\n\nMEV 1 is just the first in a planned series of missions that Northrop Grumman hopes to do to test out satellite servicing capabilities. Anderson says he\u2019s heard from many satellite operators who are eager for these kinds of services to become readily available. \u201cAlmost every operator I talked to would say, \u2018Well, if you were there today. I would buy your service,\u2019\u201d says Anderson.\n\nAstroscale\n\nWhile Northrop Grumman is looking at ways to extend the lives of satellites already in space, Astroscale is figuring out ways to remove satellites that have either failed or used up their fuel and need to be taken out of orbit. That way, there\u2019s less of a chance that these satellites will run into a functioning spacecraft and create more debris. \u201cThe company overall has a mission to make space sustainable,\u201d Chris Blackerby, Astroscale\u2019s group COO and director, tells The Verge. \u201cWe\u2019re working on end-of-life services for satellites going up, and then active debris removal for debris that\u2019s already in orbit.\u201d\n\nTo do this, Astroscale has started assembling the spacecraft for its first mission to space, called the End-of-Life Services by Astroscale-demonstration, or ELSA-d. The goal is to test out a way for two spacecraft to come together in space using magnets. The mission, slated for launch on top of a Russian Soyuz rocket in mid-2020, will loft two spacecraft: a servicing satellite and a dummy piece of debris. Each will be equipped with a magnetic plate. Once in space, the two spacecraft will separate and then practice meeting up with each other over and over again, attaching their magnetic plates together. \u201cThe primary goal was just to show that we can find locate, and dock to attach to something that has this plate on it,\u201d says Blackerby.\n\nIf this were an actual debris removal mission, Astroscale\u2019s servicing satellite would then transport the piece of debris or non-functioning satellite closer to Earth. There, gravity would drag the junk downward until the satellite burned up as it plunged through Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Right now, Astroscale says the main focus is taking failed satellites out of orbit, but Blackerby says these magnetic plates could be used to fix broken vehicles as well.\n\nOf course, the only way for this future to work is if all satellites are built with this magnetic plate attached. That\u2019s why the company has been pitching satellite operators to include the plate in their spacecraft designs. Astroscale has been talking to regulatory bodies, too, to make these magnetic plates standard for all satellites built moving forward. \u201cPart of our distribution materials will be basically a brochure that says, \u2018Here is what our plate would look like. Put it on your satellite. It\u2019s lightweight; it\u2019s minimally intrusive; prepare yourself,\u2019\u201d says Blackerby. \u201c\u2018Just just prepare yourself, satellite operators, for the future potential that there will be a failure of your satellite.\u2019\u201d", "description": "In 2020, the long-held dream of repairing satellites already in orbit around Earth will come a little closer to reality.
