On Saturday complaints about the barely week-old system were added to a class-action lawsuit against Nintendo.\n\nOriginally filed in July, the lawsuit alleges Nintendo knew about a design defect in the Switch\u2019s controllers and has failed to correct or acknowledge the problem. This issue causes a Joy-Con\u2019s analogue stick to register input, a.k.a. drift, even when nothing\u2019s touching it, significantly disrupting gameplay.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t appear to have been fixed with the Switch Lite. Online reports of players experiencing drift on Nintendo\u2019s newest system started cropping up days after its release, several of which were referenced in the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it, my Nintendo Switch Lite is already drifting,\u201d one player cited wrote. \u201cI was playing BOTW and the camera kept moving without touching the analogue stick. I tried to calibrate and update the controllers but it was still the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cI beat Link\u2019s Awakening over the weekend on my original Switch Lite system,\u201d said another, \u201cI had only put like 20 something hours on it, and it started to show joy-con drift. Why is this happening earlier on than with the earlier Switch?\u201d\n\nThe firm Chimicles Schwartz Kriner & Donaldson-Smith (CSK&D) is representing 18 plaintiffs in 16 different U.S. states as part of this suit, which goes on to cite online complaints of drift with a new version of the Switch released last month. This updated version sports a longer battery life and apparently the exact same joystick defect.\n\nWhile there are no official numbers indicating how widespread this problem may be, online complaints have been cropping up since the Switch\u2019s launch in 2017. At least three Gizmodo staffers have personally experienced Joy-Con drift, including myself, and it can render a game downright unplayable if any kind of speed or accuracy is required. So, most games.\n\nThough not nearly as frustrating as having the issue crop up on the Switch Lite. While Nintendo hasn\u2019t addressed the problem in any kind of detail, the company did begin offering free Joy-Con repairs, no questions asked, after the lawsuit was entered. But the Switch Lite\u2019s controllers are built into the system itself, which means any kind of fix would involve shipping the whole thing off to a repair centre, a process I can tell personally tell you takes weeks. Tomorrow I\u2019ll be going into my third and still counting.\n\nPlenty of online tutorials have popped up offering DYI methods for troubleshooting and fixing Joy-Con drift yourself, but they don\u2019t always work and, in the case of the Switch Lite, could damage the console itself.\n\nAccording to a company memo obtained by Vice, Nintendo doesn\u2019t require warranty information as part of this free Joy-Con repair offer, but there\u2019s been no official news yet regarding anything similar with its newest system. Worst-case scenario, you could just be out a Switch Lite.\n\nNintendo did not immediately respond to Gizmodo\u2019s request for comment.
