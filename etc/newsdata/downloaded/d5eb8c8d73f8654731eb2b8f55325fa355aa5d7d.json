The gauge remained close to that level, despite a 0.2% tumble.\n\nUnwinding Hedges\n\nWashington\u2019s refusal to delay tariffs on China over the weekend is helping fuel the dollar\u2019s rally as traders unwind risk-on hedges, according to Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura International Plc. The onshore tumbled in August, suffering its biggest monthly loss since January 1994, when the modern exchange-rate regime was adopted.\n\n\u201cThere were folks who had to hedge for the slight possibility that U.S.-China found a way to de-escalate trade tensions before the latest round of tariffs came in this weekend,\u201d Rochester said, adding that bullish and Australian dollar positions and short yen bets were likely the preferred methods. \u201cThose short-term risk-on hedges were taken off yesterday. As a result, dollar headed higher.\u201d\n\nIn the near-term, Rochester remains bullish on the dollar. Factors that could see the greenback weaken would include fiscal stimulus from China, the Federal Reserve embarking on a new round of quantitative easing, or geopolitical events in Europe calming down, but that\u2019s \u201call unlikely for the time being,\u201d he said.\n\nEuropean Easing Expected\n\nInvestors would be remiss to pile into bullish euro positions ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s meeting next week, cautioned TD Securities analyst Mazen Issa. He expects the central bank to deliver a 20 basis point deposit rate cut and renewed quantitative easing to the tune of $40 billion per month.\n\n\u201cEUR/USD continues to trade on its backfoot after the floorboards at 1.10 broke on Friday,\u201d Issa wrote in a note Tuesday. \u201cWe do not think the move should be faded ahead of the ECB\u2019s large-scale easing next week.\u201d\n\nThe common currency fell as low as 1.0926 Tuesday, its weakest level since May 2017. The euro briefly erased losses following the weaker-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data, before resuming its slide.\n\nBest of the Rest\n\nWhile U.S. economic growth has slowed -- the latest evidence on display Tuesday with manufacturing data contracting for the first time in three years -- it still looks resilient relative to the rest of the world. And with the global stock of negative-yielding debt now amounting to $17 trillion, it\u2019s little wonder the greenback remains bid as investors search for yield, according to Juckes.\n\nEven as Citigroup Inc (NYSE: ).\u2019s Economic Surprise Index for the U.S. is in negative territory -- meaning reports are tending to miss expectations -- it has rebounded in the past few months, and is well above Europe\u2019s gauge.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has had more growth, higher rates, higher bond yields -- money flows to the U.S.,\u201d Juckes said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t over-think it when you\u2019ve got negative yields in Japan, the Eurozone, in Switzerland.\u201d", "description": "For the Roaring U.S. Dollar,\u00a0Factory Slowdown Is\u00a0Just a Speed Bump", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picf1f181b81708242af59a13e88c80ab8b.jpg"}
