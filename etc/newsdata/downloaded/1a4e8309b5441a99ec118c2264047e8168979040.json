The letter asked Antoine if she would marry him but Weber, who swam with just a snorkeling mask and fins, never heard her answer.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t hold my breath long enough to tell you everything I love about you. BUT... everything I love about you I love more EVERY DAY!\u201d his note read. \u201cWill you please be my WIFE. Marry me???\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never emerged from those depths, so you never got to hear my answer,\u201d Antoine wrote on Facebook. \u201d\u2018Yes! Yes! A million times, yes, I will marry you!!\u2019\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the resort told the BBC that Weber \u201ctragically drowned while free diving alone outside the underwater room\u201d on Thursday. \u201cEveryone is shaken to the core,\u201d they added.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State confirmed to Baton Rouge station WBRZ that a U.S. tourist had died in Tanzania though no other details were provided. WBRZ also reported that an investigation into Weber\u2019s death is underway.\n\nSteven Weber popped the question by swimming down to the submerged bedroom window and holding a note up to the glass.

I love you so much, and I always will.\u201d\n\nLove HuffPost?
