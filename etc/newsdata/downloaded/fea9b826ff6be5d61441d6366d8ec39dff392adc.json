We may increasingly see people placed in care homes further away from family members, and families feeling obliged to pay top-up fees for homes they consider more suitable.\n\nFamilies are being torn apart because councils are placing elderly in care homes miles away from home because of tight budgets. Town halls are supposed to use local homes even if they are more expensive but this rule has been waived - leaving families 'obliged to pay top-up fees' fore more suitable homes (file image)\n\n\u2018Local authorities are under increasing financial strain ... Many will struggle to finance adult social care unless a solution is found.\u2019\n\nMany families do not realise they can challenge the council to pay more. Mr Culver told the Sunday Telegraph of the case of a woman ordered to leave her care home because the council could not afford her fees. The suggested replacement would have taken her husband an hour to reach by bus when previously he had only to walk.\n\nThere should be a personal budget for each recipient of care and this should be matched to their accommodation, according to Mr King. In one instance a woman was forced to leave her care home because the council could not afford fees (file image)\n\nMr Culver challenged the council, which eventually agreed to pay. The Daily Mail has been campaigning for more government help for those who have to sell their homes to pay for care \u2013 particularly dementia sufferers. Under the current system, those with more than \u00a323,250 are expected to pay their own way.\n\nIan Hudspeth of the Local Government Association said: \u2018Councils do all they can to make sure their eligible care needs fit with their priorities. However, given the serious funding pressures facing adult social care, councils face incredibly difficult decisions.\u2019\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said councils were getting an extra \u00a31.5 billion funding, and the Government would \u2018set out plans to fix the system in due course\u2019.", "description": "A woman was forced to leave a care home after the council could not afford her fees, amid budget concerns of local councils.
