We need more time.\"\n\nIt's extremely hard to see how a new Brexit deal can still be agreed by this Thursday.\n\nNegotiations continue - but time is tight, and, to use the words of even the most upbeat of those involved, \"there's still much work to do\".\n\nEU internal talk is focusing now on a possible \"holding pattern statement\" at this week's EU leaders summit, along the lines of \"we've made great progress in negotiations but still need more time\".\n\nThere are also renewed mutterings about a new Brexit summit, maybe towards the end of the month.\n\nRead more from our Europe editor.\n\nFormer foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said it would be \"very difficult\" to reach an agreement and pass the domestic legislation needed to implement it by 31 October.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today that an extension of a \"few days\" might be acceptable to many Conservatives as it would make clear \"the end was in sight\".\n\n'Issue of trust'\n\nBut Environment Minister Zac Goldsmith said any further delay risked eroding the public's trust in the political system.\n\n\"If both sides wish to secure a deal, a deal can be secured,\" he told Today.\n\n\"It's a matter of political will - where there is a will, there is a way. That has never been more true than in the case of Brexit.\n\n\"There are issues of trust there, but even beyond issues of trust I don't think it serves our interest as a country to be in a permanent state of division and paralysis.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Ireland's support for any agreement is crucial\n\nWith talks in Brussels ongoing, a Cabinet meeting expected to take place on Tuesday has been postponed and is now likely to take place on Wednesday. Downing Street sources say it is to allow for a fuller update on Brexit.\n\nThe two-day EU summit is crucial because the prime minister must get a new deal approved by MPs by Saturday if he is to avoid asking for a Brexit delay.\n\nThe Benn Act passed by MPs opposed to no-deal says he must ask for an extension to the Brexit deadline if MPs do not back a deal by then.\n\nHowever, Mr Johnson has repeatedly ruled out requesting such an extension, prompting speculation that he may seek to sidestep the legislation. Labour has threatened court action to force the PM to obey the legislation.\n\nRegardless of what happens in Brussels, a showdown is anticipated in an emergency sitting of Parliament on Saturday - the first in 37 years.\n\nMPs will be able to back or reject any deal presented to them, or there will be discussions on what to do next.\n\nTimeline: What's happening ahead of Brexit deadline?\n\nThursday 17 October - Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline.\n\nSaturday 19 October - Special sitting of Parliament and the date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by MPs and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal.\n\nThursday 31 October - Date by which the UK is currently due to leave the EU.", "description": "The EU's Michel Barnier says \"good intentions\" must be turned into legal text for there to be an agreement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/085F/production/_109234120_7ecd6f9b-b395-4c4a-af10-0ab4a9a2fae9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
