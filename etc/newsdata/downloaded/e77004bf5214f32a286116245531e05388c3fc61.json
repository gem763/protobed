If you\u2019re willing to pay more for dogs that come from pedigreed bloodlines or are award winners, super-premium security pooches are available. One guard dog, a European German Shepherd, sold for a whopping $230,000.\n\nWho pays such prices for a dog? \u201cOur clients range from executives, to professional athletes and lots of women who are home alone quite a bit,\u201d November Holley, president of Harrison K-9, told CNBC.\n\nHarrison K-9 dogs are given two years of daily training in Germany, and each one is hand-selected for obedience, the ability to track scents, and responsiveness to attack cues.\n\nOnce selected, the dogs then get six to 12 more months of training in South Carolina. \u201cTraining is tailor designed for each individual family\u2019s needs,\u201d the Harrison K-9 website says. All the dogs are trained to respond to English, German, and hand signals before they can be placed in clients\u2019 homes.\n\nThe dogs are conditioned to be calm in nearly any situation and docile around children, but will spring into action on command, biting attackers and not letting go until instructed to do so.\n\nHarrison K-9 sold 50 dogs in 2018, and has already sold 30 so far this year. But as dangerous as the dogs can be to attackers, they remain extremely cute, as you can well see at their Instagram account.", "description": "Buyers include CEOs and pro athletes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xp6GzUhnggYpLfx9J7.Ovw--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/581a472282446abd543757c482cf2471", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
