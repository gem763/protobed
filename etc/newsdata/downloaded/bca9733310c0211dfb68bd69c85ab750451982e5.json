The agency must report the violation to Congress, identify the officials responsible for it and explain steps it will take to prevent similar violations. It said any subsequent actions in the future would be \"knowing and willful violations,\" subjecting officials to penalties.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nInterior did not cooperate with GAO's investigation, according to the report. An Interior spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.\n\n\"We take our responsibility to Congress seriously, and will not allow an agency\u2019s lack of cooperation to interfere with Congress\u2019s oversight of executive spending,\" GAO wrote. \"Accordingly, we issue our opinion in this matter notwithstanding Interior\u2019s failure to timely respond to our request for information.\"\n\nCongressional Democrats, who released the GAO opinion Thursday, said the opinion showed the administration clearly violated the law and pushed for consequences.\n\n\"The Secretary of Interior seems to think the rule of law doesn\u2019t apply to the Trump administration,\" Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), chairwoman of the House Appropriations Interior-Environment Subcommittee, said in a statement. \u201cThe Administration should now immediately report this violation and take corrective actions as required by law. This should put the administration on notice that their illegal actions will not be tolerated.\"\n\nHer Senate counterpart, Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), said: \"Their assurances at the time that their actions were legal have proven false, and there should be consequences for this violation.\"\n\nThen acting Secretary David Bernhardt issued a directive on Jan. 5, 2019, to tap into the entrance fees to address maintenance and sanitation issues that had developed at national parks remaining open during the shutdown.", "description": "GAO said the Interior Department moved money between accounts without authorization from Congress, in violation of federal law.", "authors": ["Anthony Adragna"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5e/76/ca480169489db50d4f35f6fe7342/190905-badlands-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
