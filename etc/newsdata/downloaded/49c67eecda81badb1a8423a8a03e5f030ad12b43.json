The engine they've developed is a conventional piston engine that runs on a combination of 70 percent water and 30 percent ethanol or any other kind of alcohol thus completely eliminating the need of diesel or petrol.\n\nWhat's more fascinating is that any car engine can be turned to be compatible with water and ethanol with simple modifications and not just save fuel costs but also be release fewer emissions.\n\nMayMaan has developed four prototypes which include a fully-functional car, a power generator and different kinds of engines. The engine is able to generate good amounts of torque with a powerful and efficient performance.\n\nEngines developed by MayMaan eliminates emission of virtually all sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) that are known to pollute the planet. One of the main challenges of alternative fuel is the high infrastructure cost for fueling and producing a brand new device. MayMaan doesn't suffer from this challenge as it is applying the same tried and tested internal combustion engine principle where its liquid fuel can be pumped just like traditional fuels. As per MayMaan's claims, it costs far less to run than any other energy solution, including fossil fuels.\n\nMayMaan was founded by Yehuda Shmueli who himself is an engineer (and the brains behind the engine), and assisted by his sons Eitan and Doron Shmueli. The company is also supported by a stellar management team including Joe Nakash, founder and chairman of Jordache Enterprises, Yedidya Ya'ari who's currently MayMaan's chairman and used to be President and CEO of Israel's Rafael Armament Development Authority, among others.\n\nRawpixel\n\nThe team was working on the project in stealth until it was fully developed. According to Yehuda, \"We have stayed under the radar for the past six years, but we decided that this is the right time to expose ourselves and talk to people and let the world know that such a solution exists.\"\n\nHowever, Eitan feels that their revolutionary engine tech will take time to get to mainstream vehicles as the auto industry is currently fixated on producing electric cars.", "description": "They have created a fascinating engine prototype that runs on water alongside ethanol to help the vehicle produce less pollution and increase fuel efficiency.
