But it\u2019s not clear if Buttigieg\u2019s plan, which comes months after many other candidates outlined their own visions, will extend coverage to everyone like he promises or satisfy progressives who want a more sweeping overhaul.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cFor years, Washington politicians have allowed the pharmaceutical industry, giant insurance companies, and powerful hospital systems to profit off of people when they are at their sickest and most vulnerable,\u201d Buttigieg said in a statement. \u201cMy \u2018Medicare for All Who Want It\u2019 plan will create a health care system that puts power in the hands of each American.\u201d\n\nWhat would the plan do?\n\n\n\nButtigieg\u2019s proposal would preserve the nation\u2019s existing private insurance industry while creating a government-run health insurance alternative. His plan, like the one offered by former Vice President Joe Biden, also would boost subsidies to help people purchase their own coverage on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces and limit the amount people pay for premiums. Separately, it would cap out-of-pocket costs for seniors on Medicare.\n\nMeanwhile, the plan would roll back Trump administration efforts that health advocates say have weakened the safety net. Buttigieg is proposing to reverse President Donald Trump\u2019s expansion of association health plans and short-term plans, which his administration argues provide a lower-cost alternative to Obamacare plans but have been criticized for providing insufficient coverage. Buttigieg is also vowing to end the first-ever Medicaid work requirements, a controversial policy that critics say is primarily intended to cut off coverage to low-income people.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s plan includes multiple provisions that take aim at politically powerful health care providers, calling for new scrutiny of nonprofit hospitals\u2019 tax exemptions and expanding regulators\u2019 authority to crack down on health care mergers. He\u2019d also limit what health care providers could charge insurers, pegging their out-of-network prices to just twice the typically lower rates that Medicare pays.\n\nThe campaign argues that limiting providers\u2019 market and pricing power is essential to lowering the costs of patients\u2019 health plans. \u201cOur plan isn't just about coverage,\u201d said a health care expert who advised the campaign. \u201cIt's about affordability.\u201d\n\nHow would it work?\n\n\n\nButtigieg\u2019s public option would be targeted to three groups of Americans: low-income people who meet eligibility standards and would be automatically enrolled; middle-income people who can\u2019t afford to purchase coverage in the individual market and qualify for subsidies; and people who opted out of expensive employer-sponsored health insurance and could be eligible for subsidies.\n\nA campaign adviser said undocumented immigrants would be allowed to buy health coverage through the ACA exchanges, but a campaign official declined to offer further details and said a specific proposal to cover all undocumented immigrants would be coming in a separate plan.\n\nMeanwhile, Buttigieg\u2019s plan would restore an ACA subsidy program that helped insurers offset the cost of their low-income patients' medical bills.\n\nWhat are the weaknesses in the proposal?\n\n\n\nButtigieg\u2019s plan can\u2019t guarantee universal coverage\n\nWhile undocumented immigrants would be allowed to buy in, it\u2019s not clear how many would be able to afford the ACA's health plans without a government health subsidy. Some Americans also might find that coverage remains too expensive, even with Buttigieg's proposal to cap premiums at 8.5 percent of income.\n\nThe plan props up the existing health care industry\n\nSome progressives \u2014 and particularly the supporters of presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2014 have called for more sweeping reforms that would essentially eliminate private insurance.\n\nHow much would it cost?\n\n\n\nCampaign officials declined to provide an estimate of the plan\u2019s cost, but a campaign adviser said that new federal spending would be in \u201cthe ballpark\u201d of an Urban Institute proposal that includes similar provisions. Urban Institute analysts estimated that their plan would cost $1.2 trillion in new federal spending over a decade, but also cut state health spending by $422 billion, for a total cost of about $790 billion.\n\nHow would he pay for it?\n\n\n\nCampaign officials said the plan could be paid for through tightening corporate taxes, but declined to offer further details.\n\nWhat have other Democrats proposed?\n\n\n\n", "description": "The plan formalizes proposals like building on Obamacare and creating a new \u201cpublic option\u201d to compete with private insurers.", "authors": ["Dan Diamond"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f0/ce/7def8b024e31b2d052b4a74cebc4/190919-buttigieg-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
