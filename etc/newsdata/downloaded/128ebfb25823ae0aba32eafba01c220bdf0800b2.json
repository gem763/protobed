REUTERS/Hannah McKay/Files\n\nConsumer prices rose at an annual rate of 1.7% in September, matching August\u2019s rate that was the lowest since December 2016, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 1.8% increase.\n\nThe figures suggest the Bank of England\u2019s forecast in August that inflation would average 1.6% in the final quarter of this year looks on track.\n\n\u201cMotor fuel and second-hand car prices fell, but were offset by price increases for furniture, household appliances and hotel rooms,\u201d ONS statistician Mike Hardie said.\n\nFuel prices fell by 2.1% compared with a year earlier, their biggest drop since August 2016, the ONS said.\n\nSurveys show expectations of inflation for the next year among the British public have started to cool after reaching their highest level in years.\n\nThe BoE has said that underlying inflation pressures mean it may still need to raise interest rates over the medium term \u2014 if there is an end to persistent Brexit uncertainty and the global economy recovers from its slowdown.\n\nThe fortunes of the labour market are key to the outlook for British inflation.\n\nBritain\u2019s jobs boom has weakened in the approach to Brexit with the number of people in work unexpectedly falling by the most in over four years and unemployment rising, official data showed on Tuesday.\n\nThe ONS labour market data showed a dip in the pace of pay\n\ngrowth which recently hit its fastest in more than 10 years.\n\nUnderlying inflation pressures are modest for now.\n\nAn ONS measure of core inflation, which excludes energy, fuel, alcohol and tobacco, rose to 1.7% from 1.5%, as expected.\n\nThe ONS figures also suggested less short-term pressure in the pipeline for consumer prices.\n\nAmong manufacturers, the cost of raw materials - many of them imported - fell 2.8% in annual terms last month, the biggest drop in three years and driven down by the falling cost of crude oil.\n\nThat was a bigger drop than any economist had forecast in the Reuters poll, which had pointed to a 1.8% drop.\n\nManufacturers increased the prices they charged by an annual 1.2% last month compared with 1.7% in August, again weaker than the consensus forecast for a 1.3% rise.\n\nThe ONS said house prices in August rose by an annual 1.3% across the United Kingdom as a whole compared with July\u2019s seven-year low of 0.8%, marking the first increase in house price inflation in five months. Prices in London alone fell by 1.4%.", "description": "Britain's inflation rate failed to rise as expected last month as petrol prices fell at the fastest rate in more than three years, a boost to consumers ahead of Brexit.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441414015&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0MA", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
