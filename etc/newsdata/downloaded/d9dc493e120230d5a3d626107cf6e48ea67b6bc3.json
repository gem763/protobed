Its Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index dropped to 51.6 from 55.1 in July, declining for a third month and edging close to the threshold of 50 that separates contraction from growth.\n\nFears of a global downturn are deepening as signs of a manufacturing slump have emerged from Europe to Asia. Domestic competitive pressures are compounding the outlook for the U.A.E., a federation of seven emirates that includes oil-rich Abu Dhabi and tourism and trade hub Dubai.\n\nHeightened market competition continued to weigh on growth, forcing companies to cut prices by the most since April, according to panelists surveyed by IHS Markit in the monthly release. Activity in the non-oil economy increased \u201cat a notably softer rate\u201d compared to July, with weaker demand curbing the expansion, it said.\n\nEven so, customer spending remained robust in the U.A.E. Domestic demand was also stronger in neighboring Saudi Arabia, where the IHS Markit PMI rose slightly in August.\n\nMeanwhile hiring eased among U.A.E. firms, with employment numbers largely stagnant within the non-oil sector. But at least for now, next year\u2019s World Expo in Dubai is helping support sentiment, according to IHS Markit.\n\n\u201cThe dip in activity growth dampened business sentiment in August, although the underlying forecast was still strong,\u201d IHS Markit economist David Owen said in the report. \u201cWith the Expo 2020 coming, many businesses were positive that the market will see strong levels of activity in the coming year.\u201d", "description": "Global Downturn Is Starting to Gain a Foothold in the Gulf", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picaf3e89f438d67c866e8fa2cd71a15ab9.jpg"}
