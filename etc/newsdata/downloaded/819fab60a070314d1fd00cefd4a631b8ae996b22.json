I watched him in the nets the other day, he was striking it pretty well, so if that opportunity comes for him I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll take it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no real ceiling on him. He hits the ball 360 (degrees), he\u2019s not too worried about what\u2019s coming at him and he\u2019s inventive and powerful.\n\n\u201cThis format is seriously suited towards him and I\u2019ve no doubt he will succeed at the highest level.\u201d\n\nGregory will also be targeting a first international appearance this week after catching the eye in Tuesday\u2019s warm-up with an entertaining cameo of 29 not out from 11 balls at the back end of England\u2019s innings.\n\nThe Somerset all-rounder added to the BBC\u2019s Test Match Special: \u201cI was expecting to be a little bit more nervous with the bat but when you\u2019re going in with two and a half overs to go, it\u2019s kind of \u2018put your head down and swing as hard as you can\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt was a nice blowout and a nice experience.\u201d\n\nGregory leaked 27 runs from his two overs and put down a difficult chance on the run off fellow newcomer Matt Parkinson as Colin Munro\u2019s belligerent 107 not out from 57 balls saw the hosts overhaul England\u2019s 188 for five with nine balls to spare.\n\nGregory added: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a really good surface and against some high-quality players, so if you miss your mark and you\u2019re not quite on then they\u2019re going to punish you.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a few things we\u2019re going to have to tweak going into that first game but I\u2019m sure the boys will have a couple of hard days\u2019 hard practice and we\u2019ll be raring to go.\n\n\u201cIf I get an opportunity I\u2019ll try to do what I\u2019ve done at Somerset and see what happens. I\u2019m 100 per cent backing my ability and hopefully I\u2019ll get the nod.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Lewis Gregory has backed Somerset team-mate Tom Banton to flourish at the highest level despite another low score for the opener in England\u2019s final warm-up before their Twenty20 series against New Zealand.", "authors": ["David Charlesworth"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/29/07/tom-banton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
