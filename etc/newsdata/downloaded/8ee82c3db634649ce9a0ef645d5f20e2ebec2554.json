If the Liberals fail to carry out their threats over boundaries, they will be left with no bargaining power in the Coalition.\n\nIf the Libs exact public revenge over the Lords by blocking boundary changes, it would signal the end of the coalition as the Lib Dem frontbench would have to vote against the measures in the Commons.\n\nThe decision to dump House of Lords reform also leaves the Government with a legislative hole, which is expected to be filled with plans to boost jobs.\n\nEither way, restless Liberal Democrats will be enraged to see another of their coalition prizes scuppered by backbench Tory MPs. In return, rebellious Tories will be further emboldened by their House of Lords victory.\n\nAll this makes for a very turbulent time for the coalition. Expect severe recriminations when the political parties meet for their annual conferences over the coming months.\n\n\n\n", "description": "KIRSTY WALKER: At a time when the country is gripped with Olympic fever, few ordinary people will be interested in the latest developments on House of Lords reform and boundary commission changes.", "authors": ["Chapman", "Co For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/08/03/article-2183152-13F49CA0000005DC-460_1024x615_large.jpg", "published_at": "2012-08-03"}
