But it was her eventual husband that she ended up with - despite her saying there was zero attraction.\n\nFour weeks later the abuse began.\n\nShe said she went to the south coast of England at the end of the February to visit them both and he was jealous.\n\n\u201cHe had a go at me after I went down to see both of them, I didn\u2019t realise they both liked me,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWithin four weeks I did not recognise that the abuse had started. When I came back I was accused of sleeping with his friend.\"\n\nHe turned up in Swansea in April and again in May, she said.\n\n(Image: Jonathan Myers/Wales Online)\n\n\"He came down and wanted to know what was going on and if I was in a relationship with his friend. I did not know how to get away.\n\n\"I wasn\u2019t in a relationship with him - I didn\u2019t want to get married.\u201d\n\nThe warning signs were there, she said, but she stayed with him, even after he once grabbed the handbrake of her car as she drove along a Swansea road at 50mph.\n\n\u201cI fled from the car in tears, I thought he was going to kill me. But I refused to make a statement. Nothing was ever done.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThere were times when I went to leave and he snapped my car keys.\u201d\n\nBut despite the constant abuse she said she felt forced into marrying him.\n\n\u201cI tried to end the relationship but he said he was not leaving, I was afraid.\n\n\u201cHe gave up his job and one day told me \u2018I will cause a scene in your workplace.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe said he wasn\u2019t going back to England. He said, 'I am staying here now and we are going to get married' and we did.\"\n\nThey married in the summer of 2006.\n\nSigns of domestic abuse Is your partner excessively jealous and possessive?\n\nIs your partner charming one minute and abusive the next? Does your partner have sudden changes of mood \u2013 like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde?\n\nIs your partner stopping you from seeing your family and friends? Do you feel isolated?\n\nIs your partner constantly criticizing you and putting you down in public?\n\nDoes your partner embarrass you, often in front of family and friends, so that you are seen in a bad light?\n\nDoes your partner play mind games and make you unsure of your own judgment?\n\nDoes your partner tell you you\u2019re useless and couldn\u2019t cope without them?\n\nDoes your partner control your money?\n\nDoes your partner tell you what to wear, who to see, where to go, what to think?\n\nDoes your partner pressure you to have sex when you don\u2019t want to?\n\nAre you starting to walk on eggshells to avoid making your partner angry?\n\nDoes your partner monitor your movements? Or check up on you via your email, Facebook, Twitter or by looking at your text messages?\n\nDoes your partner use anger and intimidation to frighten you and make you comply with his demands?\n\nHas your partner ever threatened you, or intimidated you by using violent language or smashing up the furniture?\n\nAre you forced to alter your behaviour because you are frightened of your partner\u2019s reaction?\n\nAre you blamed for their behaviour e.g. they say you were \"asking for it\" or deserved the abuse? If you answered yes to any of the above questions, then you may be experiencing domestic violence. Abuse is a crime and it is never your fault. You don\u2019t have to deal with this alone.

I was in quite a bad way after it happened,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe hit me across the face with a bottle of wine just before Christmas because I came home late from work.\n\n\u201cI had blood across my face and a split lip.\n\n\u201cI have been slapped, pulled downstairs by my hair and he would spit tea over my face and he would throw food over my head.\n\n\u201cI have tried to leave him and he tried to pull the mirrors off my car.\u201d\n\nShe said the problems escalated in 2010 and her partner was also cheating on her at that time.\n\nShe repeatedly tried to run away and said she would get on a plane to any part of the world that she could escape to.\n\n\u201cI thought this man was going to take my life,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cI would book a holiday and go away. I ran away to Australia, Vietnam and Cambodia on my own.\n\n\u201cI broke down in front of police officers.\"\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until 2012 that her husband faced some justice. He was convicted of assault in Swansea Magistrates Court, after pleading guilty.\n\nBut she was still unable to get out of the relationship.\n\nIn 2012 she said she desperately tried to leave, but it was not until 2015 that she finally did so.\n\nShe went on to discover how he had treated former partners as badly as her.\n\nDuring her ordeal she said her weight plummeted to seven stone and she struggled to be able to live a normal everyday life, leading her boss to urge her to take time off work.\n\nShe said it was not the first relationship of domestic violence that she had endured and had faced a similar situation with the father of her daughter.\n\n\u201cMy daughter\u2019s dad was not a very nice person, I spent a lot of time in refuges I couldn\u2019t do anything at all,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she was just grateful to have the support of the people she worked alongside. It was her colleagues that pulled her through.\n\n\u201cMy colleagues would come to the doctors with me,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI got myself out of a situation that I couldn\u2019t get out of,\u201d she added.\n\nShe now lives with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the aftermath of years of domestic violence.\n\n\u201cI still get PTSD, I have been assessed by a psychiatrist.\n\n\u201cI told people I can feel his hands on me. I still get the tears, you do struggle.\u201d\n\nHer husband is barred from going near her, but she still looks over her shoulder in fear that he will again try to track her down.\n\nShe even asked her work to change her company car so he wouldn\u2019t know the registration and she would be able to stay safe.\n\nBut she said he still had an element of control over her life, as she had so far been unable to divorce him.\n\nHowever, she said she was determined to live every aspect of her life.\n\n\u201cI am not proud of what I have been through, I wished I was dead as I was constantly in fear of my life,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI just embrace everything I can and that he did not break me.\u201d", "description": "Swansea woman said she could remember the moment when he threw the rope around her neck as if it was yesterday, but she then \u201cblacked out\"", "authors": ["Liz Perkins", "Image", "Jonathan Myers Wales Online"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20510039.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Abuse-victim.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
