American analysts and policymakers see events of the past week as largely benefiting Russia, the Syrian government, the remnants of the Islamic State and Iran.\n\nAmid the great clamor of commentary, the United States and Europe are erroneously banking on sanctioning Turkey to contain the fallout. The harsh truth is that the United States, Europe and Turkey share responsibility for the creation of this crisis. They have all made a series of policy mistakes since the beginning of the Syrian war in 2011.\n\nFor the United States, the main failure was to na\u00efvely believe that the partnership established with the People\u2019s Protection Units, or the Y.P.G. \u2014 an organic offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or the P.K.K., which is recognized by Ankara, Washington and Brussels as a terrorist group \u2014 could be long lived. Oblivious to the huge and negative impact of this commitment on bilateral ties with Turkey, the White House followed the Pentagon\u2019s recommendation based on its an assessment that the Turkish counteroffer, of a group of Syrian opposition fighters trained by both Turkey and the C.I.A., would be inadequate to carry the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nNevertheless, Turks never came to terms with the United States siding so clearly with a group they consider to be a core national security threat. And American support for the Y.P.G. pushed it toward a perilous overreach. Kurds constitute about 10 percent of Syria\u2019s population but with American support, they came to control almost one-third of its territory.", "description": "The United States and Europe are erroneously banking on sanctioning Turkey to contain the fallout in Syria.", "authors": ["Sinan Ulgen"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/opinion/16ulgen/16ulgen-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
