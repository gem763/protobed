The theory is that bonds and stocks tend to move in opposite directions, and so they balance each other out: A sell-off in risky stocks can be counteracted by the gains in fixed income.\n\nThe 60-40 portfolio's performance has also been used as a benchmark against which to judge endowment funds, hedge funds, and other investors thought to have more sophisticated approaches and asset-class choices.\n\nBut BAML has laid out a compelling case for the death of the 60-40 portfolio going forward and provided alternative trades for investors looking to preserve its characteristics.\n\n\"60/40 may have thrived in the 2000s and 2010s but will not survive the 2020s,\" a team of strategists, including Jared Woodard, said in a recent note to clients.\n\nThe market is now upside down\n\nTheir first observation is that investors are no longer buying stocks and bonds for the reasons that the 60-40 portfolio infers.\n\nStocks have become attractive for the returns they can generate today, not in the future. And bond yields have been in a secular decline for so long that investors now buy them for the accompanying price rallies.\n\nIn other words, the market has been turned on its head, in Woodward's view: Investors like stocks for yield and bonds for price rallies.\n\nRead more: Nobel laureate Robert Shiller forewarned investors about the dot-com and housing bubbles. Now he tells us which irrational market behaviors have him most worried.\n\nHe provided data to back up his assertion. This year, investors have poured $339 billion into global bond funds to participate in the price rally that has ensued. Meanwhile, $208 billion has flowed out of equity funds \u2014 and both are on pace for record years.\n\nAnother significant change he observed is that Treasurys have become a lot more volatile.\n\nThey are thought to be the stable, low-risk portion of a portfolio. But thanks to huge demand from investors, bonds have recently displayed stocklike market moves. Returns over the past six months are at an eight-year high, while yields have fallen over the past year at the second-fastest pace since the financial crisis.\n\n\"In a low-growth, low-rates world, owners of capital fight for safe-asset yield wherever they can find it,\" Woodard said.\n\nHe added: \"There are several factors causing this shift: high Debt burdens restrict demand and animal spirits; excess bank deleveraging reduces the supply of credit; tech disrupts established industries; globalized deregulated flows of labor, goods, and capital flood the market; and aging demographics depresses growth.\"\n\nCrowding risk in bonds\n\nWoodward now foresees trouble for investors who are relying on bonds for safe returns during periods of uncertainty.\n\nFor one, there has hardly ever been this much interest in the Treasurys market. Global institutional investors now have record exposure to US versus European bonds, Woodard said. And he thinks this crowding now makes investors vulnerable to sharp and sudden sell-offs.\n\nAdditionally, the diversification benefit of bonds for equity investors is on shaky legs.\n\nWoodard's chart below shows that bonds have supported stock-market investors during times of turmoil for much of the past two decades \u2014 by far the longest stretch in history.\n\nBut the risk is that their correlation could now flip such that bonds don't rally when stocks fall.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch\n\n\"The future of asset allocation may look radically different from the recent past, and it is time to start planning for what comes after the end of 60/40,\" Woodard said.\n\nFor investors seeking alternatives, he offered the following suggestions:", "description": "The traditional 60-40 portfolio that is used as a benchmark for diversification \"will not survive the 2020s,\" the bank's strategists said.", "authors": ["Akin Oyedele"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8501da2e22af101e734c07?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
