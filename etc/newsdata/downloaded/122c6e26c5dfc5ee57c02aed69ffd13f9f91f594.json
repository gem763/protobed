According to the Chicago Tribune, homicides and shootings in 2019 are down 11 percent from this time a year ago. And the number of shootings is down more than 26 percent this year compared with 2016.\n\nAnd according to Chicago Police Department data cited by the Associated Press, the number of homicides in the city has dropped 31 percent thus far in 2019, compared with the same point in 2016, and shooting incidents have decreased by 38 percent over that same period.\n\nDuring a press briefing later Monday, Johnson touted the reductions in crime on his watch.\n\n\u201cThe progress that we\u2019ve made as a city has gone unnoticed,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly not where we want to be, but we\u2019ve made progress. ... The national narrative that we\u2019re a city on fire is just simply not true.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday the same police officers the president criticized for their inability to protect this city spent all day protecting him,\u201d Johnson continued.\n\n\u201cMy job is to keep the city safe,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve been a cop 31 years, I\u2019ve been a superintendent for four years. I\u2019ve dedicated my life to keeping this city safe. And that is my focus.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump and Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson (Photos: Leah Millis/Reuters, Zbigniew Bzdak/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) More\n\nThe president also criticized Johnson for failing to detain undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cEddie Johnson wants to talk about values,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPeople like Johnson put criminals and illegal aliens before the citizens of Chicago. And those are his values. And frankly those values to me are a disgrace. ... I want Eddie Johnson to change his values and change them fast.\u201d\n\nThe president said Johnson\u2019s support of so-called sanctuary cities, like Chicago, is \u201ca betrayal of the oath of the shield\u201d and \u201ca violation of his duty to serve and to protect.\u201d\n\nDuring his hourlong speech, Trump also invoked the case of actor Jussie Smollett, who claimed he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by men who yelled \u201cMAGA country,\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign slogan. Police later concluded that Smollett staged the attack.\n\nThe president said Smollett \u201cbeat up himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he said \u2018MAGA country\u2019 did it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hate crime.\u201d\n\nTrump also compared the Smollett incident to the impeachment inquiry against him launched by House Democrats.\n\n\u201cIt's a real big scam, just like the impeachment of your president is a scam,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Trump touted the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the ISIS terror leader who was killed in a U.S. raid in Syria over the weekend.\n\nTrump called al-Baghdadi a \u201csick and depraved man.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now he\u2019s dead,\u201d the president said. \u201cHe\u2019s dead as a doornail.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more coverage from Yahoo News:", "description": "President Trump used his first trip to Chicago as president to disparage the city and its police chief, who had boycotted his appearance.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GSXoPHwu4UnR2eaUu66nig--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/8180f3b0-f9a6-11e9-b6fe-1e3bdf41ac07", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
