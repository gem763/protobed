Thank you!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, announced Thursday the decision to hold the G-7 at Doral, saying White House planners scouted about a dozen sites but that Trump National Doral Miami was \u201cfar and away\u201d the best facility.\n\nThe decision prompted immediate ethical concerns.\n\nMr. Trump has maintained ownership of his business empire after becoming president, though he turned over day-to-day operations to his children.\n\nInvestigations by press outlets have found foreign governments have poured money into his properties since he took office. Those sorts of moves had spawned lawsuits arguing the payments were emoluments, violating the Constitution\u2019s prohibition on profiting from the presidency.\n\nSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican allies said it was difficult to defend the Doral decision and that it came at a politically sensitive time for the president, who is fending off an impeachment inquiry over Ukraine and widespread criticism over his decision to pull troops from the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\nA few Republicans did go out on a limb for the president. Both of Florida\u2019s senators, Rick Scott and Marco Rubio, said it would be good for their state\u2019s economy, only to see Mr. Trump walk back the idea.\n\nMr. Trump said he planned to host the G-7 \u201cat cost,\u201d though his resort would have gotten exposure \u2014 a free ad, essentially \u2014 from hosting foreign powers at his business.\n\nEven in pulling back from Doral, the president got in one last promotion.\n\n\u201cI thought I was doing something very good for our Country by using Trump National Doral, in Miami, for hosting the G-7 Leaders,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is big, grand, on hundreds of acres, next to MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, has tremendous ballrooms & meeting rooms, and each delegation would have its own 50 to 70 unit building. Would set up better than other alternatives.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
