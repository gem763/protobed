Danny Lawson/PA Wire/Pool via REUTERS\n\nJohnson, who is pushing for a snap election, was speaking to a BBC television crew in the northern city of Leeds on Thursday when a man pushing a child in a stroller interrupted the interview.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re playing games with parliament. You\u2019re playing games with the public,\u201d the man shouted at Johnson. \u201cYou should be in Brussels negotiating. Where\u2019s the negotiation going on? Where is it? You\u2019re in Morley in Leeds. You should be in Brussels.\u201d\n\nJohnson was initially unable to respond before challenging the man - who spoke with an Irish accent - when he said the government\u2019s negotiations with the European Union about a new Brexit deal were going nowhere.\n\n\u201cActually that\u2019s not true at all. We are on the verge of getting a deal,\u201d Johnson said before repeating his criticism of the opposition Labour Party for not agreeing immediately to his demand for an early election.\n\nA crowd gathered and some people began to argue with Johnson\u2019s challenger.\n\nJohnson turned to the onlookers and said: \u201cCan I just ask people here: do you think we should get out on October 31st?\u201d\n\nSome people shouted: \u201cYes!\u201d and cheered. Others shouted: \u201cNo!\u201d Johnson got another mixed response when he asked the crowd if he thought Labour\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was standing in the way of Brexit.\n\nJohnson was given a clearer message in a separate encounter with a member of the public during his trip to Leeds.\n\nVideo footage showed the prime minister shaking hands with a man on a street who smiled before telling him with a smile: \u201cPlease leave my town.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will very soon,\u201d Johnson replied.", "description": "Boris Johnson got a taste of just how deeply his Brexit strategy has split public opinion in Britain when he was persistently harangued by man on a shopping street for \"playing games\" while others cheered the prime minister.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426876145&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850X4", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
