Ryan Graves scored into the empty net with 39.1 seconds left after a flurry of shots by the Wild.\n\n\"I was kind of scrambling around a little bit. I couldn't get up. Desperation save,\" Grubauer said. \"The guys played it really well, they got the puck out and scored. Game over, two points.\"\n\nDubnyk had 28 saves.\n\nRantanen, who missed training camp and the preseason before agreeing to a contract with Colorado last weekend, also scored and has three goals in two games. Pierre-Edouard Bellemare got his first goal with Colorado and Nathan MacKinnon had two assists.\n\nColorado, which has won its first two games for the third time in the last four years, gets a five-day break before playing Boston on Thursday.\n\n\"Good start. We want to keep it going,\" Landeskog said.\n\nRyan Suter had a goal and an assist, and Zach Parise got his first of the season for the Wild, who have lost their first two games against Central Division rivals. Minnesota allowed four goals in the third period at Nashville on Thursday and gave up two quick goals to Colorado before settling down.\n\n\"You take the first 10 minutes out of the game, as you take the first 10 minutes of the game in Nashville, we were really good,\" Wild coach Bruce Boudreau said. \"We played really hard. The effort we put in was really good. It was a hard-fought game.\"\n\nMinnesota recovered from an early 2-0 deficit but Landeskog put Colorado back in front when he tipped in a pass from Rantanen at 18:54 of the second.\n\n\"I'm not surprised when I get those on my tape from Mikko anymore,\" Landeskog said. \"He's been serving those for years. I'm glad I was able to put it in, especially losing that 2-0 lead.\"\n\nRantanen and Bellemare scored 1:27 apart early in the first period. Rantanen's goal came just 23 seconds after Colorado went on the power play.\n\nSuter cut the lead in half at 10:17 of the first, and Parise's power-play goal at 8:31 of the second period got the Wild even.\n\n\"When we got the second one, I thought we had chances to go ahead,\" Parise said. \"They came out buzzing, which you have to expect in this building. We had looks and opportunities, the effort was there and we played hard. They capitalized and that was it.\"\n\nMinnesota had two breakaways, but couldn't convert either. Grubauer made a glove save on Ryan Donato's backhander in the first period, and Ryan Hartman's chance just ahead of the Colorado defense went wide right in the second.\n\nNOTES: Colorado C Nazem Kadri was hit in the left skate by a teammate's shot late in the second period and he went to straight to the locker room. He returned for the third period. ... Dubnyk played in his 300th game for the franchise. He ranks second behind Niklas Backstrom (409) for goaltenders. ... Avalanche LW Matt Calvert played in his 500th NHL game. ... Minnesota LW Zach Parise has 37 points in 37 career regular-season games against Colorado.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWild: Plays at Winnipeg on Thursday.\n\nAvalanche: Hosts Boston on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
