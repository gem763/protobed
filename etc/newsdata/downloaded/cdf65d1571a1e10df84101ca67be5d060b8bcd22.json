Global growth may be stabilizing. 10-yr Treasury yield rose. Dr Copper rose. Rotation from growth to value continued. The Fed is expected to cut short-term rates this week. Earnings were mixed.\n\nWalmart [WMT] is attractive. It reports on Nov 14 but PG reported great numbers this week and 15% of PG sales are via WMT \u2013 although they are quite different stocks, there is a good correlation between them. WMT is growing its online, grocery-pickup-and-delivery, health clinic businesses and those bring additional traffic to help its core retail business. And AMZN stumbled this week.\n\nHalloween is typically good for the market. Add that to other market lores \u2013 bad seasonality May 1 \u2013 October 31, good seasonality Nov 1 \u2013 April 30, Santa rally, January effect, Summer doldrums [or rally], etc.\n\n[The CME FedWatch tool, based on current fed fund futures quotes, shows the following probabilities for 2019:\n\nFor 3rd hike [cut],\n\n0% for hike [93.5% for cut] at FOMC 10/30/19;\n\n0% for hike [95.1% for cut] at FOMC 12/11/19;\n\nhttp://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html ]\n\nFor the week [index changes only], DJIA +0.70%, SP500 +1.22%, Nasdaq Comp +1.90%, Russell 2000 +1.51%. DJ Transports +3.31%; DJ Utilities +0.11%. US$ +0.57%, oil/WTI +5.36%, gold +0.76%.\n\nYTD [index changes only], DJIA +15.56%, SP500 +20.57%, Nasdaq Comp +24.23%.\n\nPg M6, Europe: Anglo-German travel giant TUI [TUI.uk/TUIFY; fwd P/E 10.3] is attractive. It has been hurt by recent turmoil in travel industry, Brexit, Boeing 737 MAX. It has grown by acquisition. The integrated travel provider owns travel agencies, hotels, airlines, cruise ships, retail stores.\n\nPg M6, Emerging Markets: China has hundreds of super-startups [Unicorns] and several were supposed to go public this year but didn\u2019t. Many have high revenue growth but obscure paths to profits. Almost half of the joint-venture companies are owned/funded by BABA and TCEHY and they are in no rush for IPOs. The US-China trade tensions have made the US listings problematic. HK demonstrations make HK listings unattractive. Chinese authorities have restricted domestic IPOs and 1,000+ companies are already on waiting list for IPOs.\n\nPg M11, Commodities: Silver [SLV +14.7% YTD] is more attractive than gold [GLD +16.7% YTD]. Gold-silver ratio at 85 is much higher than its long-term average of 65. Global silver demand exceeds supply.\n\nPg M7, Options: Using options to hedge portfolios is suggested as prices are near historic highs.\n\n[SP500 VIX 12.65, SKEW 125.70] [10-Yr TYVIX 4.61] [Yahoo Finance data]\n\nPg M30, M36: A good week in Europe [Denmark +2.49%, Belgium -3.31%] and a good week in Asia [Singapore +2.37%, New Zealand -3.02%].

Dollar rose, DXY 97.83, +0.7% [M39]. Gold rose to $1,513, +1.6%; the gold-miners rose [M34].

There are fewer moderates and there is lack of bipartisanship. Sectors most affected by elections have been IT, consumer-discretionary, healthcare, materials. Ignore political noise and focus on actual policies. Be opportunistic id sectors or stocks overreact to political projections or developments. Ben Phillips of EventShares ETF PLCY offers some names for sports betting [BYD, PENN, TRWH, CHDN], infrastructure [AQUA, GVA, STRL, ASTE, NVEE, ROAD], ethanol production [REX, GPRE, REGI], shipping and IMO 2020 [STNG, SBLK, DSSI, PBF, VLO, HFC].\n\nPg 5, Up & Down Wall Street: Cyclicals [US and global] are showing good technical strength. Bad news may be good for cyclicals as they benefit the most from stimulus of last several months. Bond yields bottom when recession fears peak, and we may have passed that point. German DAX is breaking out while the German economy is poor. EMs are also breaking out. We will soon enter favorable seasonality period [Nov 1 \u2013 April 30].\n\nSince the Fed started cutting rates in July 2018, the SP 500 has been flat. The Fed is expected to cut again next week and then pause for a while. The PCE is below 2% target. Globally, there have been 40 rate cuts in the past 3 months; rates peaked 12 months ago; $13.3 trillion in bonds have negative yields [vs $17 trillion in late-August]. The effects of monetary stimulus should be kicking in soon. Lagarde takes over at the ECB on November 1 and she is expected to continue Draghi\u2019s easy monetary policies.\n\nPg 9, Streetwise: Tesla/TSLA CEO Elon Musk\u2019s potentially $56 billion, 10-yr pay package goes to Delaware court soon. The case will focus on conflicts and process, less on the pay amount(s).\n\nMore later\u2026.\n\nYBB", "description": "[ Italics-bold within the brackets are my additions/elaborations ] [ New M* Discussions doesn\u2019t allow any colors for cut-and-paste from WORD ] MW - 28145", "authors": ["Valued Contributor", "Explorer"], "top_image": "https://zwcdr85544.i.lithium.com/html/assets/favicon.ico?15D4DC4041FDD3CD56F6121736C9C68D", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
