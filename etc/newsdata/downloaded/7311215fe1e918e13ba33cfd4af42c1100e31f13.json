He died because they wouldn\u2019t help and we intend to make them pay for that.\u201d\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n\"Megan begged them for help but she was told no one could leave their posts. They even said the only thing they could suggest was if she called an ambulance.\"\n\nWitnesses alleged a member of staff at the reception \"didn't bat an eyelid\", reports The Sun.\n\nOne witness said \u201cThey didn\u2019t even bat an eyelid and told her she\u2019d have to call an ambulance because the A&E doctors aren\u2019t allowed to treat anybody outside.\n\n\u201cIf a doctor could have gone out there before security brought the man inside, that might have been enough. Common sense should have prevailed. We\u2019re talking about basic humanity here.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust said: \u201cOur condolences are with Mr James\u2019 family.\n\n\"At this stage we are actively working to understand what happened to Mr James and his death has been reported to the coroner.\u201d", "description": "Paul James, 55, collapsed outside the sliding doors of New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton, after attending with stomach pains and being sent away with painkillers", "authors": ["Abigail O'Leary", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20664460.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Paul-James.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
