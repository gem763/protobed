It causes some learning disability that can vary, and people may be more likely to have heart, digestive system, hearing and sight problems.\n\nMs Mordel, of Reading, Berks, said in the witness box: \u201cI knew someone from work with Down\u2019s syndrome. I saw how difficult his life is and I would not have continued my pregnancy.\n\n\u201cI would not have wanted a disabled child and I would not have wanted my child to suffer the way disabled people suffer. I wouldn\u2019t want to have brought my child into the world like that.\u201d\n\nThe court heard her 2014 pregnancy with Aleksander was unplanned.\n\nAlthough she had been booked in to have the test, medics claimed she had declined the screening.\n\nMr Justice Jay said the sonographer had failed to obtain informed consent to go ahead without the screening.\n\nHer initial question to Ms Mordel had been \u201cabrupt\u201d and her follow-up did not go far enough, he said.\n\n\u201cShe knew, or ought to have known, Ms Mordel had indicated provisionally she wanted Down\u2019s screening,\u201d he said, adding Ms Mordel failed to process the question and her reflex response was to say, \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nThe judge added: \u201cNothing I have said should be interpreted as suggesting that the birth of a child with Down\u2019s syndrome must be seen as unwelcome.\u201d", "description": "Edyta Mordel, 33, is set to receive up to \u00a3200,000 after the \"wrongful birth\" of her son", "authors": ["Martin Bagot", "Image", "Nick Razzell", "Champion News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20541159.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-PROD-Edyta-Mordel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
