(Image: Cartoon Network)\n\nThe music of Steven Universe: The Movie tells the specific story of how Steven and the Gems are forced to confront yet another person devastated by Pink Diamond\u2019s reckless actions. But the movie\u2019s villain Spinel and some of her songs touch on a very real experience series creator Rebecca Sugar went through as a child \u2014 an experience she hinted at in Adventure Time, interestingly enough.\n\n\u201cEverything Stays,\u201d the first song Rebecca Sugar wrote for Adventure Time after she\u2019d already begun working on her own project, Steven Universe, is featured in an episode by the same name that looks back at important moments in Marceline\u2019s life. In the context of Adventure Time, the song\u2019s something Marceline\u2019s mother sang to her to ease her fears about her strange nightmares, but the lyrics take on a much deeper and more emotional significance when you interpret them with the plot of Steven Universe: The Movie in mind.\n\nAfter the movie premiered, more than a few fans theorised that Sugar might have secretly tucked a bit of Steven Universe\u2019s story into Adventure Time right in front of everyone\u2019s faces \u2014 and in a new video, the animator confirms that to essentially be the case. The actual story the song\u2019s based on, Sugar explains, is about a moment in her childhood when she lost a beloved toy in her family\u2019s garden only to find it months later, irreversibly changed from being bleached by the sun.\n\nEven though it\u2019s a fantastic nod to Sailor Moon\u2019s transformation sequences, Steven realising that Spinel\u2019s tear-streaked, heartbroken form is a reflection of the person that she\u2019s become is initially framed as one of the most devastating moments in the movie.\n\nBut Spinel\u2019s ultimate fate finding love with the Diamonds speaks to the optimism that\u2019s baked into the lyrics of \u201cEverything Stays\u201d if you\u2019re listening for it. Her experiences have changed her in undeniable ways, but she\u2019s still there, and accepting herself as the person she\u2019s become is the first step toward finding happiness again.", "description": "The music of Steven Universe: The Movie tells the specific story of how Steven and the Gems are forced to confront yet another person devastated by Pink Diamond\u2019s reckless actions.
