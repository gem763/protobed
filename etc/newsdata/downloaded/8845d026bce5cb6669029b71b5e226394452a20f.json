They are pioneering new business models for marketing-tech software and shaking up decades-old industries like television. And they're raising money from VC firms and investors who are funding both established companies and new startups.\n\nPlease submit your nominations here by October 4.\n\nWhat we're looking for\n\nCriteria for the list will be determined by several factors, and we are looking to identify a diverse group of people with different ranks and roles, based on our own reporting and nominations.\n\nIn determining the list, we'll consider company revenue, headcount and funding as well as interesting business models and the size of the problem that a firm is trying to solve.\n\nNominations for leaders should include the executive's title, role, responsibilities, and examples of the company's performance in the marketing industry, with as many quantitative results as possible.\n\nThis list is specific to marketing-tech companies and separate from a list Business Insider will publish later this year on top marketing-tech as well as advertising companies.\n\nHere are a few examples of previous lists that show the structure and format that we use:\n\nSweeping regulations like California's upcoming privacy bill threaten to wipe out the advertising industry.
