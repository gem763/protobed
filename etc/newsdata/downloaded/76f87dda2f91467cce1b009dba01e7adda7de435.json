Research has suggested that seeing just four-and-a-half minutes of food advertising causes children to eat 60 more calories than they need a day.\n\nThe OHA found children who watched all six episodes of Britain's Got Talent shown during the week would have seen more than 22 minutes of unhealthy food adverts.\n\nThe Obesity Health Alliance found that of all the adverts that played before the hour-and-a-half shows, more than one in five were for junk food or sugary drinks\n\nChildren who watch just one episode of Britain's Got Talent have four-and-a-half minutes of adverts for junk food shoved down their throat (file image)\n\nThe charity says this could have lead to them eating an extra 300 calories over the six days.\n\nITV viewing figures show Britain's Got Talent is regularly watched by hundreds of thousands of children.\n\nBut it is not classed as 'of particular appeal' to children under current rules, meaning restrictions on junk food advertising do not apply.\n\nCampaigners argue existing regulations, introduced in 2007 for TV and in 2017 for non-broadcast formats, have significant loopholes.\n\nThey only apply to programmes, films or websites specifically targeted at children, such as cartoons.\n\nThe OHA found just two per cent of all the adverts which aired during Britain's Got Talent were for fruit or vegetables.\n\nIt noted that not a single advert for the Veg Power initiative was shown over the whole week, despite ITV's sponsorship of the flagship programme.\n\nThe Government had earlier this year carried out a review looking into how effective a 9pm watershed on junk food adverts would be. But it found that the intervention would be ineffective.\n\nCaroline Cerny, from the OHA, said: 'This analysis clearly demonstrates how the food industry makes sure their sugary and high calorie food products are kept firmly centre stage in children's minds.\n\n'This type of advertising is clearly linked with children going on to eat more calories than they need.\n\n'A comprehensive 9pm watershed on unhealthy food adverts on TV and online would ensure children can enjoy their favourite programmes without being flooded by adverts for pizza, burgers and ice cream.'\n\nViewer figures show Britain's Got Talent is regularly watched by hundreds of thousands of children. But it is not classed as 'of particular appeal' to children under current rules, meaning restrictions on junk food advertising do not apply\n\nMalcolm Clark, policy manager at Cancer Research UK, said the adverts could easily nudge vulnerable children towards food loaded with fat, salt and sugar.\n\nHe added: 'Research shows that time spent online and watching commercial TV quickly adds up and makes children more likely to ask for, buy and eat junk food - which is why the industry bombards them with unhealthy messages.\n\n'Government and regulators must step in to protect the health of the next generation.'\n\nProfessor Stephen Powis, an NHS medical director, said: 'Obesity is a dangerous public health threat, leading to a string of serious illnesses for millions, and thousands of children ending up in hospital as a result, so every industry needs to take a look at what it can do to support urgent action to prevent harm and safeguard children.'\n\nAn Advertising Association spokesman said further advertising restrictions would have no effect.\n\nThey said: 'A significant reduction in exposure to HFSS marketing during the past 15 years has had no impact on obesity prevalence, and shows further advertising restrictions are not a solution.\n\n'The Government's recent Impact Assessment on the 9pm watershed showed the intervention would be ineffective, in that it would remove just 1.7 calories from children's daily intake.\n\n'We wholly support the ambition to halve childhood obesity prevalence by 2030, but fundamentally we want to see solutions that will work.\n\n'Any intervention must be led by evidence of impact, holistic, and targeted at the root causes of obesity.'", "description": "The London-based Obesity Health Alliance found children who watch just one episode of Britain's Got Talent have four-and-a-half minutes of adverts for junk food  shoved down their throat.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/16/20043002-0-image-a-7_1571759788528.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
