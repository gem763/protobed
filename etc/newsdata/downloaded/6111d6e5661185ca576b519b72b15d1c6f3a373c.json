It announced the 7 Pro like it\u2019s the new addition to the lineup \u2014 and that is indeed a phone full of new things \u2014 but the novelty for OnePlus\u2019 strategy is that the company is now doing an Apple-esque upcycling of older models as its entry-level offering. That\u2019s what the OnePlus 7 is: a OnePlus 6T with an update to a Snapdragon 855 processor and a 48-megapixel camera and not much else.\n\nAm I complaining? Only a little. The 6T had the fastest and smoothest performance of any Android device until the OnePlus 7 Pro arrived. It had a reasonably sized notch and slimmer display bezels than you\u2019ll find on an iPhone XS Max. But OnePlus has now made those compromises less acceptable by hiding the selfie cam in a mechanical pop-up module, throwing in a gorgeous 90Hz screen, and turning the side bezels into pencil lines on the OnePlus 7 Pro. None of the original good things about the OnePlus 6T change in the 7, for better or worse, but the 7 Pro is just constantly there, mocking you with its superiority and availability. If you can afford it. In the UK, the OnePlus 7 with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage costs \u00a3499, while the same spec in a 7 Pro is \u00a3649.\n\nOutside of OnePlus\u2019 portfolio, the \u00a3499 price point has become much more competitive recently. Google\u2019s \u00a3399 Pixel 3A undercuts the 6T by a nice margin while having a vastly superior camera. And the Black Shark 2 and Razer Phone 2 both offer beefier gaming performance, with the latter also having a high-refresh screen like the new OnePlus flagship. Where does the OnePlus 7 fit into this highly competitive landscape?\n\nOur review of OnePlus 7 Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Good ergonomics for a large phone\n\nButtery-smooth performance\n\nPretty display\n\nStrong battery life Bad Stuff No wireless charging or waterproofing\n\nFaces tough competition from Google\u2019s Pixel 3A\n\nMirror finish is a fingerprint nightmare\n\nCamera bump is annoyingly prominent Buy for $634.00 from OnePlus\n\nFrom the point of view of the naive phone buyer, the OnePlus 7 is pretty great. It costs less than the most expensive smartphones while performing every bit as smoothly and looking every bit as glamorous. Granted, I detest the fingerprint magnet that is the glossy glass back of this phone, but that\u2019s another quality that it shares with super premium devices. The main point is that if I hand a OnePlus 7 to an uninformed consumer, they\u2019d be rather delighted with it for a starting price of \u00a3499 (\u20b932,999 in India or \u20ac559 in EU) or even at \u00a350 more with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.\n\nThis is the classic flagship-on-a-budget that OnePlus is known for, and to get the in-depth account of all its intricacies like battery life, performance, display quality, and ergonomics, I direct you to my OnePlus 6T review. If you don\u2019t care beyond the question of whether this is a good phone, it is, and since so little has changed since the 6T, that review is all you need.\n\nBut value is the slippery fish that we\u2019re all trying to capture when making a considered purchase like a smartphone. It\u2019s not enough for it to merely be good, it has to be worth the money, and that can only be judged in the context of the broader market.\n\nSo let\u2019s not dodge the obvious confrontation here: is the OnePlus 7 worth it when compared against Google\u2019s cheaper Pixel 3A or 3A XL? The spec sheet would tell you \u201chell yes\u201d: the 7 is one of the most affordable Snapdragon 855 devices, it comes with at least 2GB more RAM than Google\u2019s meager 4GB, has a larger 6.41-inch screen, and the Pixel is stuck with only 64GB of storage that isn\u2019t expandable. Dual-SIM enthusiasts should also write the Pixel off straight away and find a cozy home for their cards in the OnePlus phone.\n\nDespite the OnePlus 7 having the rehashed 2018 design, it\u2019s the Pixel 3A and 3A XL that look like they\u2019re from last year. That speaks to the design leadership of OnePlus as well as the corresponding weakness of Google\u2019s bezel-tolerant aesthetic. If I were buying a phone as a gift, I\u2019d go for the OnePlus 7. But shopping for myself, I\u2019d opt for the Pixel 3A XL.\n\nIt\u2019s not because the Pixel is faster. Even the premium Pixel 3 can\u2019t match the fluidity of OnePlus\u2019 keenly tuned performance. And it\u2019s not because the speaker or display is better \u2014 both are good for the price and on par with the OnePlus 7 \u2014 or even because the Pixel 3A models have headphone jacks. No, friends, it\u2019s almost entirely about that unparalleled Pixel camera. I am willing to tolerate slightly slower performance, chunkier bezels, and a worse multitasking interface from Google just to get my hands on the best camera to ever grace the market below \u00a3500. OnePlus uses the extremely popular 48-megapixel Sony sensor that produces 12-megapixel shots of decent quality. Its secondary lens is for a 5-megapixel depth sensor to help with portraits, though the Pixel camera still takes better portraits even without dedicated depth equipment.\n\nThere are other advantages to taking up the Pixel path, too. While both the 3A XL and OnePlus 7 have a 3,700mAh battery and a 1080p screen, the smaller Pixel display drains that battery more slowly and makes that phone a bit of an endurance champ. I may be in the minority, but I also really enjoy the lighter feel of the plastic Pixel 3A devices. They\u2019re easier to handle and operate, and I\u2019m really not sure how we came to this point of believing that phones weighing in excess of 180g / 6.4oz, as the OnePlus 7 does, are normal. It\u2019s like we\u2019ve all developed collective amnesia about the glorious, polycarbonate-clad Nokia N9.\n\nThe OnePlus 7 does have one particular design feature that bothers me, and that is its camera bump. It\u2019s far more pronounced on this phone than it is on the 7 Pro, Pixels, Galaxy devices, or anything Huawei or Apple make. The Huawei P30 Pro and iPhone XS Max both have nicely softened edges to their pill-shaped camera modules, and their designers have the good sense to place those bumps off to the side of the phone. OnePlus sticks this big, almost sharp slab in the middle of an otherwise very polished and soft shape, and it\u2019s a persistent irritation in the hand.\n\nTurning to the gamer-oriented Black Shark 2 and Razer Phone 2, both now priced identically to the OnePlus 7, I find another situation where my experience disagrees with the specs. Only this time, the other phones are the ones with juicier specs, whether it\u2019s the Black Shark 2 and its souped-up cooling system or the Razer Phone 2 and its extra buttery 120Hz screen. Both have light-up logos on the rear, which are used to signal notifications, or the engagement of gaming mode, or their user\u2019s complete disregard for good taste. Both have great speakers. Both can be handled roughly without worry. And both are ridiculously heavy to be considered reasonable everyday phones.\n\nThe OnePlus 7 is a dainty feather compared to that pair of beefy brutes, and yet it still has that top-tier Snapdragon system-on-a-chip to make light work of any gaming task. Its 1080p resolution comes in handy here, helping to assure good battery life by not overworking the GPU. It has most of the gaming capability of the Black Shark and Razer Phone, but doesn\u2019t scream about its performance might the way that the other two do.\n\nI\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t also mention the Xiaomi Mi 9, arguably the most similar phone to the OnePlus 7, featuring the same 48-megapixel sensor, albeit in a more capable triple-camera arrangement. Xiaomi also fits the Snapdragon 855 and wireless charging inside the Mi 9, but that phone is a total non-starter for me because of MIUI. OnePlus simply does the best version of Android, and I might even include Google\u2019s original flavor in that statement. Plus, OnePlus has committed, in both words and deeds, to delivering prompt and long-term Android updates for its phones. Xiaomi\u2019s still living in the 2012 era of Android skins.\n\nMy abiding impression of the OnePlus 7 is that it\u2019s a OnePlus 7 Pro Lite. The Pro has the 90Hz screen, which is not just smoother, but also more accurate. That phone also gets the 30W Warp Charger in the box, whereas the OnePlus 7 has the same fast charger as you could\u2019ve got with the OnePlus 3T. And though both phones have the 48-megapixel sensor and UltraShot camera tech, the 7 Pro has a wider aperture on the main camera, ultrawide and telephoto cameras, and the ability to take slightly better shots. On the aesthetic front, you only get the fingerprint-loving mirror black option on the 7 (with a red edition for India with the higher memory spec), whereas the 7 Pro has that gorgeous matte blue and an upcoming almond edition, the latter of which I\u2019ve seen and very much like.\n\nTwo points work in the OnePlus 7\u2019s favor in comparison to its prettier, bigger, more powerful sibling. First is the size, as the OnePlus 7 still exists in the \u201clarge phone\u201d category, whereas every reviewer who\u2019s wrestled with the OnePlus 7 Pro for longer than a day has remarked on its big-unit proportions. The other thing is the absence of the curved screen sides. The OnePlus 7 still has the so-called 2.5D Gorilla Glass, but that\u2019s just a softening of the very edge, whereas the 7 Pro has some gratuitous slopes on its sides that make it harder to grip and easier to accidentally palm something on screen. The Huawei P30 is a similar example of the cheaper edition of a phone having the better screen ergonomics by virtue of its designers simply not having the budget to fiddle too much.\n\nIt feels like OnePlus invested all its time designing the 7 Pro, and then the company trickled down what it could fit into the OnePlus 6T chassis and budget space. I\u2019m perfectly okay with that. I think the OnePlus 7 is a phone that most people will enjoy using, though it might be a frustrating reminder of the 7 Pro\u2019s existence for the geekier among us.\n\nPhotography by Vlad Savov / The Verge", "description": "The OnePlus 7 is the junior model in the OnePlus 7 series.
