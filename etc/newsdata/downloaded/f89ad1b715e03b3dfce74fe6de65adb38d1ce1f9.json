It\u2019s still broken.", "language": "en", "text": "Two years ago, the husband of one of the academy\u2019s members was accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and eventually convicted of rape. The ensuing scandal tore apart the committee, exposing a history of lax regulation, a deep well of bad judgment and a vein of misogyny. Some members resigned, others refused to participate. The Nobel Foundation, which funds the award, raised serious concerns about the committee\u2019s governance. The future of the literature prize seemed imperiled.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe committee members decided to take a year off, postponing the 2018 Nobel Prize in literature to 2019. The extra time, it was said, would give members a chance to get their house back in order and regain the world\u2019s trust. New members were appointed. Rules were set down. A fresh spirit of transparency was in the air.\n\nAnd then came Thursday\u2019s announcement of the winners of the 2018 and 2019 Nobel Prizes in literature. The big test: an opportunity to show that the committee members could, in fact, carry on Alfred Nobel\u2019s vague instructions to select \u201cthe most outstanding work in an idealistic direction.\u201d\n\nFirst, the 2018 prize was awarded to Polish author Olga Tokarczuk for what the judges praised as \u201ca narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut then the other shoe \u2014 or jackboot \u2014 dropped, and any celebration of Tokarczuk\u2019s work was hijacked by a fresh controversy: The Swedish Academy awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in literature to Peter Handke. He\u2019s a controversial Austrian writer known for his sympathy for the late Yugoslavia leader Slobodan Milosevic, who was accused of genocide. Handke not only attended that butcher\u2019s funeral, he delivered a eulogy.\n\nAs Kosovo\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Vlora Citaku, put it: \u201cThere is nothing nobel about this!\u201d\n\nThis is no way to demonstrate good judgment or to regain trust. It\u2019s just another tone-deaf stunt by a group of Swedish snobs who command a disproportionate and undeserved wedge of the world\u2019s attention.\n\nAD\n\nLet\u2019s set aside the ridiculous presumption that each year the Nobel Prize in literature goes to \u201cthe\u201d greatest writer in the world. Given the complications of translation, the influences of cultural bias and the limits of any small group\u2019s knowledge, the distinction of \u201cbest\u201d is impossible to make with any defensible certainty. The prize is always political, always a compromise, always a statement of values.\n\nAD\n\nWhich is what makes Handke\u2019s selection this year, of all years, so maddening. It didn\u2019t have to be this way.\n\nConsider: Before this year, only 14 women had won the Nobel Prize in literature. Given the committee\u2019s record of chauvinism and the need to rebuild its reputation after a shocking sex scandal, why not select a female writer for the 2019 Nobel Prize in literature? Yes, two women in one year! Imagine the discussion we\u2019d be having right now if the beloved Canadian writer Margaret Atwood had won this week. We can argue about the literary quality of some of her novels (please skip \u201cHag-Seed\u201d), but what a profound influence her best work has had on the conversation about the rights of women. What a powerful way for the committee to connect with millions of actual readers.\n\nAD\n\nOr why not use this year\u2019s prize as an opportunity to draw attention to parts of the world that have been long slighted by the committee? Anders Olsson, a member of the Swedish Academy, all but promised that expansive vision earlier this month when he said, \u201cWe had a more Eurocentric perspective on literature, and now we are looking all over the world. . . . We hope the prize and the whole process of the prize has been intensified and is much broader in its scope.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA broader scope would have spotted many remarkable writers besides the Austrian eulogizer of a genocidal tyrant.\n\nHow long must Kenyan novelist Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o wait for the Nobel\u2019s approval? (The man is already 81 years old!) Or why not recognize the novelist Maryse Cond\u00e9 and give Guadeloupe its first Nobel laureate in literature? Yan Lianke\u2019s novels are banned in China, but they effectively satirize the excesses of capitalism, too, so he\u2019s an equal opportunity offender from a country of 1.4 billion people that has won the Nobel Prize in literature only twice.\n\nAny one of these writers \u2014 or a dozen others \u2014 would have been celebrated around the world along with Tokarczuk. Whatever Alfred Nobel meant by \u201can idealistic direction,\u201d it\u2019s clear that the Swedish Academy is not moving toward it.\n\nRon Charles writes about books for The Washington Post and hosts TotallyHipVideoBookReview.com.\n\nAD", "description": "Austrian author Peter Handke is this year\u2019s winner, which doesn\u2019t inspire much confidence in the selection process.", "authors": ["Ron Charles", "Critic", "Book World"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LKgpjWR2Ss4bFE3dtYC59rPkOgw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7HT3BDXLJYI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
