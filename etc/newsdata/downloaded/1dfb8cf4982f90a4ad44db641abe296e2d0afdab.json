We just don\u2019t know.\n\n\u2018We are using a check and trace technique by setting up a prawn or bacon bait to catch one which is then marked with a dot and released.\n\n\u2018The plan is that hornet will return to the bait every few minutes and fly off in a particular direction. We keep on moving the bait and if the times get quicker and quicker then we know we are in the right area.\u2019\n\nExtinction Rebellion launch action plan to blockade London for two weeks\n\nIn July, Mark claimed to have counted 80 Asian hornet queens \u2013 compared to just four at the same time last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEach nest produces about 200 to 300 virgin queens.\n\nWhich is bad news for humans as well as bees, as we are intolerant to hornet venom.\n\nLast year a resident on Jersey nearly died from anaphylactic shock when he was stung after disturbing a nest while cutting his garden hedge.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
