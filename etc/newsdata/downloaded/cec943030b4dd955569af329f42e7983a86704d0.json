Here are just three reasons why the USDA shouldn\u2019t move forward with this plan:\n\n1. Compounding one mistake with another.\n\nThe federal government is trying to solve one harmful policy (increasing the tariff rate to 25% on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports that were previously subjected to a 10% tariff, and potentially imposing additional tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods) with another harmful policy (the aid).\n\nThese tariffs drive up prices for Americans. In fact, the very purpose of tariffs is to make imports more expensive. The additional costs on Chinese imports are largely paid by American importers who then can pass those costs on to consumers.\n\nAnother major problem is trade retaliation. In response to U.S. tariffs imposed last year, China retaliated with its own tariffs. The Congressional Research Service explained that China \u201chas levied retaliatory tariffs on about 800 U.S. food and agricultural products that were worth about $20.6 billion in exports to that country in 2017.\u201d\n\nNow there\u2019s the increased U.S. tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports. In response, China announced that it will impose higher tariffs on $60 billion in American goods, including American food and agricultural products.\n\nThe special aid for farmers only makes matters worse. Taxpayers are now going to be required to pay as much as $20 billion more to help farmers offset the damage from the self-inflicted harm caused by tariffs.\n\nThese special farm aid \u201csolutions\u201d can lead to a terrible precedent; namely, creating a justification for maintaining and even expanding tariffs, instead of opening up trade opportunities.\n\nIn fact, that appears to be happening now.\n\n2. Inappropriately picking winners and losers.\n\nFarmers certainly are not winners in these trade disputes, including the trade dispute with China. However, they would be getting favorable treatment over other interests and individuals.\n\nThese trade disputes are hurting far more people than farmers. For example:\n\nConsumers are going to be hurt through the tariffs on goods. Higher consumer prices\u2014especially for products that meet basic needs, such as food items\u2014are regressive in nature, having a disproportionate impact on lower-income households.\n\nTaxpayers are paying out billions of dollars in aid.\n\nMany other industries (including small businesses within these industries) are feeling the harmful effects of the trade disputes, just like the agricultural sector.\n\nIn addition to the inappropriate favoritism, this assistance to farmers creates a slippery slope. There is no logical stopping point as to who should receive special aid.\n\n3. Duplicative payments.\n\nThese special aid packages for farmers seem to ignore the fact that the payments are generally duplicative in nature. Taxpayers already provide about $15 billion a year to many agricultural producers, largely to help insulate some producers\u2014inappropriately\u2014from having to compete in the market.\n\nThat includes triggering payments to producers when they do not meet revenue targets or when commodity prices decline.\n\nSoybean producers, who are significantly impacted by China\u2019s retaliation, receive about $2 billion a year already to address revenue and price issues from multiple programs, and they receive the third-most farm program support of all commodities.\n\nRegardless of whether there are tariffs or not, the special aid is a mistake. The U.S. shouldn\u2019t exacerbate the harm caused by the trade disputes.\n\nU.S. trade negotiators should remember what President Ronald Reagan said in a 1988 radio address he delivered to the nation:\n\nOver the past 200 years, not only has the argument against tariffs and trade barriers won nearly universal agreement among economists but it has also proven itself in the real world where we have seen free-trading nations prosper while protectionist countries fall behind.\n\nHis powerful words were true then, and they are still true today.", "description": "Last July, the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0announced\u00a0that it was going to provide\u00a0$12 billion\u00a0in aid to help farmers with the \u201ctrade damage\u201d from numerous trade disputes.", "authors": ["Daren Bakst", "Senior Research Fellow In Agricultural Policy", "Bakst Studies", "Writes About Agricultural", "Environmental Policy", "Property Rights", "Among Other Issues."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-05/GettyImages-656302545.jpg?itok=uojQ_BVm"}
