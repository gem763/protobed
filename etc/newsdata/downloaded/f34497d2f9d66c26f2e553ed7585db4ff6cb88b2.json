Anything else \u2014 any lingering, any humanity \u2014 can feel superfluous, or even wasteful, especially for a generation scapegoated as entitled for wanting things that used to be considered basic. It\u2019s as though doing more (even when we\u2019re doing something as simple and sedentary as riding a train) with less is always the ultimate goal.\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to see why, when an advertisement highlighting convenience and quickness pops up, we believe maybe this really is the thing that will make life better. Maybe this is what \u201ccontemporary\u201d looks like. But I wish small things \u2014 meals on a train, unplanned moments that can\u2019t be logged as self-improvement or furniture that is owned \u2014 didn\u2019t feel old-fashioned. I wish people knew that my generation wants more than to optimize our lives, or to feel trendy because of how fast we\u2019re hustling. I wish slowing down didn\u2019t feel like a luxury.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rainesford Stauffer", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Sunday Millennial-Dining-Car-Amtrak.Html"], "top_image": ""}
