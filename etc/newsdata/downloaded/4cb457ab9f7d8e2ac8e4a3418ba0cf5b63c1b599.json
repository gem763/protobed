Only this one will last throughout the remainder of the NFL season.\n\nESPN+ is bringing back \u201cNFL PrimeTime\u201d with Chris Berman and Tom Jackson beginning Sunday after a 14-year absence. It will air on the streaming service on Sunday nights from 7:30 p.m. to 8:15 p.m. EDT and will be available on demand until Wednesday night.\n\nESPN had Dan Patrick and Keith Olbermann back for \u201cSportsCenter\u201d on Sept. 6, but that was a one-night only affair.\n\n\u201cNFL PrimeTime\u201d was a staple of ESPN\u2019s coverage of the league from 1987 to 2005, when the network aired Sunday night games and it was the only outlet to get extended highlights. It went off the air in 2006 when NBC took over the rights for \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d and ESPN started airing \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d\n\nBerman and Jackson did a Sunday night version of highlights from 2006 to 2015 but it didn\u2019t have the same feeling or length as \u201cPrimeTime.\u201d\n\nBerman said he has been in lengthy discussions with ESPN\u2019s brass about possibly returning. Not only does it celebrate a milestone anniversary for the network, but it also comes as the NFL celebrates its 100th season.\n\n\u201cI know how I hear all the time from fans that they wish the show was back. They say how they miss the highlights, Tom\u2019s analysis and the music,\u201d Berman said during a telephone interview. \u201cThere are many ways to get highlights now but this has the storytelling and the analysis. We\u2019ll have new viewers but will have plenty of old ones as well in a 21st Century format. That\u2019s kind of interesting when you think about it.\u201d\n\nESPN+ general manager Russell Wolff said the return of one of the network\u2019s most beloved shows on a new platform is a great combination.\n\nWith the show available until Wednesday it will include highlights of the Sunday and Monday night games when they conclude.\n\nPrimeTime marks ESPN+\u2019s third NFL offering. Peyton Manning is doing a series called \u201cPeyton\u2019s Places,\u201d which takes a look at key moments in NFL history as the league celebrates its 100th season. Manning will also be part of the second season of \u201cDetail,\u201d which analyzes key players during the season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "ESPN's 40th anniversary has become a perfect time for reunions.
