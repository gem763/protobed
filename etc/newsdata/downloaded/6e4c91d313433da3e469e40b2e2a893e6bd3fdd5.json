I don't even think he knows what he's talking about. That's my take on it.\u201d\n\nAfter spending a few minutes ranting against \u201ccowardly\u201d Adam Schiff, Hannity continued going after Trump\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cI guess the truth is complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what, you know\u2014this is why, I think, some of these people are so stupid. Read the transcript. We don't need a non-whistleblower whistleblower.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don't need a chief of staff's idiotic interpretation of things,\u201d he added of Mulvaney, \u201cwhen the president and the president of Ukraine and everybody else can read it all themselves. That's what's amazing.\u201d\n\nHannity\u2019s take stood in sharp contrast to that of his fellow conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who heaped praise on Mulvaney for his performance during his show.\n\n\u201cYou hear how good Mulvaney is here?\u201d Limbaugh said after playing a clip from one of his many contentious exchanges with reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s wiry but he\u2019s explosive. And he\u2019s snarking back at \u2019em and they don\u2019t even know it.\u201d\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke Dunks on \u2018Disgraced TV Host\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
