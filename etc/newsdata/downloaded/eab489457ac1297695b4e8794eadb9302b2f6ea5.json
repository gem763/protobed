Several models wore their hair in plaited braids, a hairstyle that many have come to associate with 16-year-old Swedish environmentalist, Greta Thunberg.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Models walked down the foliage-filled runway in an array of earthy garments tied up with rope belts and covered in botanical prints.\n\nFlorals, while not necessarily groundbreaking, featured prominently, with petals stitched onto canvas suits and appliqu\u00e9 blooms blossoming from Hessian maxi skirts and pinafores.\n\nAccessories followed a \u201dgardening tools, but make it fashion\u201d aesthetic, with woven straw hats and generous tote bags large enough to stash a sneeboer and some scissors.\n\nMeanwhile, fans of Dior's signature frothy tulle gowns were appeased with embellished mesh versions adorned with thistles and poppies.\n\nBut the collection also had a feminist edge, which has been typical for the label since Chiuri was appointed in 2016 and made headlines with her \"We should all be feminists\" T-shirts, a slogan coined in an essay by writer Chimanmanda Ngozi Adichie.\n\nThis time around, the female trailblazer inspiring Chiuri was Christian Dior's sister, Catherine, who survived capture and torture in a German concentration camp in the Second World War and returned to Paris to become the first woman to have a florist's licence.\n\nThe front row was also filled with powerful women haling from a range of disciplines, with Jennifer Lawrence, Karlie Kloss and Julianne Moore all in attendance.\n\nSee all the photos from the spring/summer 2020 Dior show by clicking through the gallery above.", "description": "Paris Fashion Week got off to a scenic but sustainable start on Tuesday evening with the Dior show, which was staged in a temporary grove comprising 164 trees.
