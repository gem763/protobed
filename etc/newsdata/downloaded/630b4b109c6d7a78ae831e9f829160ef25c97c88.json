Video shot by News 12 The Bronx showed court officers surrounding one man and taking him to the ground.\n\nCedeno, now 20, was convicted at a non-jury trial in July of manslaughter, assault and criminal possession of a weapon. Prosecutors described him as the aggressor in the fatal encounter in a U.S. history class at the since-closed Urban Assembly School for Wildlife Conservation.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

He also stabbed 16-year-old Ariane Laboy five times, including twice in the chest, as he tried to intervene, prosecutors said.\n\nCedeno never denied stabbing the students, but insisted he acted in self-defense after years of harassment for being gay. He said he made a split-second decision to pull the switchblade, which he had bought online for self-protection, after McCree pelted him with trash and punched him. Other students testified that Cedeno instigated the fight.\n\nBronx District Attorney Darcel Clark said in a statement that there was no evidence McCree or Laboy ever bullied Cedeno. The defendant\u2019s \u201cexplosion of rage has left so many lives in ruins, including his own,\u201d she said.\n\nMcCree\u2019s death was the first homicide inside a New York City school since 1993.\n\nCedeno, who faced up to 25 years in prison on the manslaughter and assault charges, pleaded for leniency at Tuesday\u2019s sentencing hearing, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not the same person I was two years ago.\u201d\n\nMcCree\u2019s mother, Louna Dennis, told reporters outside court she was grateful that a judge rejected his bid for youthful offender status, which could have significantly trimmed his time behind bars. Alleged \u201cI didn\u2019t get my 50 years, but I\u2019ll take 14,\u201d Dennis said. \u201cHad he gotten youthful offender, it would have been maybe one-and-a-half. I\u2019ll take the 14.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Abel Cedeno claimed he acted in self-defense, after years of anti-gay harassment, when he stabbed two classmates at a Bronx school in 2017", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/abel-cedeno-new-york-school-stabbing.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
