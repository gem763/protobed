It's the moment we've been waiting for all year\u2014the 2019 Emmy Awards! LOL JK, that's not the only moment we've been waiting for.

You know you have, and tonight, we finally have that answer.\n\nMargaret and Pete didn't walk the red carpet with each other tonight but OMG, Margaret looked beyond amazing! Margaret showed up solo and looked super stunning in a simple off-the-shoulder, black gown.\n\nView photos Photo credit: Frazer Harrison - Getty Images More\n\nPete and Margaret were first spotted together when they attended the Venice Film Festival, but just a few days prior to their festival appearance, Us Weekly had already confirmed that some ~thangs~ were going on between them. \u201cThey\u2019ve been seeing each other for a couple of months, and Margaret is really excited about him,\u201d a source told the magazine. Apparently, Pete and Margaret were supposed to walk the Venice Film Festival red carpet together but decided not to at the last minute.\n\nInstead, Pete and Margaret attended the premiere for her movie, Seberg. And it was the first official pictures that we got of them together! Er\u2014well, kinda. Pete was sitting directly behind her, but was totally smitten with her by the look in his eyes.
