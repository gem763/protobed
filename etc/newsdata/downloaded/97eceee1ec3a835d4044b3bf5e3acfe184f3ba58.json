The privately held company already does not sell e-cigarettes or vaping products.\n\n\u201cTobacco products are certainly a profitable part of our business, but our company\u2019s mission is to nourish people\u2019s lives,\u201d Schnucks Chairman and CEO Todd Schnuck said in a statement. \u201cTobacco products directly contradict our core mission and that means that they simply don\u2019t belong in our stores. We respect people\u2019s right to make decisions that are best for them, and while we know this may not sit well with everyone, we believe it\u2019s the right thing to do for the health of our communities, and our customers and that makes it the right decision for our company.\u201d\n\nThe grocery chain said removing tobacco is part of a broader effort to focus on wellness and promote healthier choices for customers. Other efforts include a partnership with workout centers to encourage physical activity and the launch of a program that teaches life skills and health habits to children. The store\u2019s app also allows customers to view nutritional information.\n\nSchnucks, which was founded in St. Louis in 1939, is \"a third-generation, family-owned grocery and pharmacy retailer committed to nourishing people\u2019s lives.\" Schnucks operates 115 stores in Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Iowa, and employs 14,500 people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that we will disappoint some customers by discontinuing the sale of the product,\u201d Schnuck told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \u201cBut when we look at the grand scheme of things well, what\u2019s the right thing to do? And we believe discontinuing the sale of tobacco products is the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nSchnucks will sell through its existing inventory through the end of the year, and starting on Oct. 15 - and continuing indefinitely - Schnucks will offer double Schnucks Rewards points on all over-the counter smoking cessation products. The company will also continue its practice of not selling e-cigarettes or vaping products.\n\n\u201cTobacco products directly contradict our core mission and that means that they simply don\u2019t belong in our stores.\u201d - Schnucks Chairman and CEO Todd Schnuck\n\nMissouri, where the majority of Schnucks stores are located, has one of the nation\u2019s highest smoking rates - about 21 percent among adults \u2013 but that is down from 25 percent in 2011. Missouri also has the nation\u2019s lowest tobacco tax rates, 17 cents per pack of cigarettes.\n\nThe vast majority of cigarettes in Missouri are sold in gas stations and convenience stores \u2014 about 69 percent according to a 2017 study published in Preventative Medicine. Less than 5 percent are sold in supermarkets, according to that study. Schnucks stores typically have one lane where customers can purchase tobacco products.\n\nPrivately-held Schnucks declined to say what percent of its sales were from tobacco.\n\nRobin Koval, CEO of anti-tobacco nonprofit Truth Initiative, applauded the move by Schnucks. \u201cWe know that when tobacco is easily accessed, easily available, when young people see it in the store, that all contributes to making it seem acceptable and normal for young people,\u201d Koval said. \u201cSo these kinds of moves are important.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nSchnucks has a 30 percent share of the St. Louis grocery market since it acquired of 19 Shop \u2019n Save stores a year ago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud of what we\u2019re doing and trying to take a leadership role in this and hope that others would give it a lot of thought,\u201d Schnuck told the Post-Dispatch, who feels other stores should follow suit.\n\n\u201cSchnucks has historically been a great partner to the American Cancer Society and this action shows that they, like us, are truly committed to fighting cancer from every angle,\u201d Gary Reedy, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society, said in a statement. \u201cThere remains an urgent need for all of us to do more.\u201d\n\nOther chains have stopped selling tobacco products in recent years, which started when CVS enacted its ban in 2014. Walmart announced in May that it was raising the minimum age to buy tobacco products to 21 from 18, a move that Walgreens announced recently.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nNew York City banned the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products in drug stores and other stores that contain pharmacies, such as supermarkets and discounters, at the start of this year.", "description": "Schnucks becomes the latest chaing bans tobacco sales.", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Schnucks.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
