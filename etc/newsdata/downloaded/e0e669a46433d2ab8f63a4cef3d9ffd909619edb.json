His brother now runs a company called Escobar Inc.\n\nHe told Metro: \u2018Elon is a small little imported snake. The snakes that you see in the jungle sometimes when it gets dark and rainy.\n\n\u2018I step on those snakes. He will see, my power, soon.\n\n\u2018He never reached out to me, disrespecting me, disrespecting my brother, disrespecting my family, my name, everything.\n\n\u2018He is a small South African boy, who should not play with the lions. I am the lion.\n\n\u2018The lion decides over the future of all non-lions. Snakes are not in the kingdom.\u2019\n\nRoberto Escobar also claimed to be working on a tech product which will allow his firm to rival Apple.\n\n\u2018I need around four years to make it bigger than Apple,\u2019 he told The Telegraph.\n\nThis is the flamethrower made by Escobar Inc. (Photo: Escobar Inc)\n\n\u2018Within the next month we are going to launch our firs,t product, I cannot tell you what it is, but it will be much better than anything Apple ever did.\u2019\n\nMusk released his own \u2018Not a Flamethrower\u2019 in 2018 and sold 20,000 units at $500 a pop \u2013 meaning he earned $1,000,000 from sales.\n\nIn July this year, Musk responded to the drama with the simple statement: \u2018It\u2019s Not a Flamethrower, Mr Escobar.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, we asked Roberto what his brother would do in this situation.\n\nHe joked: \u2018If Pablo was alive, Elon Musk would be begging us to please take all of his Tesla shares and all his money, and we would not do it.\n\n\u2018Many people have faced bigger consequences for much much less when we were ruling the world.\n\n\u2018But for some reason I like this guy Elon, so I would probably take him out for a nice dinner.\u2019\n\nThis is Elon\u2019s \u2018Not a Flamethrower\u2019 (Picture: The Boring Company)\n\nHe added: \u2018I did not talk to Elon, his engineers spoke with me. I don\u2019t need to talk to Elon. Whoever comes to me, I speak with.\n\n\u2018Elon is a small young boy. I made all the money he ever made in maximum one year. If he wants he can email me, it is easy to reach me.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t mind to meet with him and see who is the real boss.\n\n\u2018If he is not too scared. No bodyguards, just me and him, a gentleman\u2019s meeting. In Colombia. I can not travel outside at this time.\u2019\n\nEscobar Inc. recently successfully fought and won a court case against a \u2018cyber-squatter\u2019 who bought the domain name PabloEscobar.com and bravely demanded $3million to hand over the virtual deeds.\n\nAfter a Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution was filed, Escobar Inc. was granted ownership of the site and will use it to sell legal products and merchandise.\n\nPablo Escobar (Source: Rex Features)\n\nPablo Escobar has become something of a folk hero in Columbia, where he was known for helping the poor, but was also infamous as a \u2018narco-terrorist\u2019 who oversaw a large number of killings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, he is world-famous and has only become more renowned since the Netflix series Narcos become a hit. He died in 1993 from a gunshot wound aged just 44.\n\nWe spoke to Roberto Escobar, who told us the tactics used in this case were markedly different from the approach Pablo and his cartel would have taken.\n\n\u2018In the past, I would call my hitman and show him a photo,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Anywhere in the world, regardless of protection, that person would immediately agree with our terms.\n\n\u2018Now, we call our lawyers.\u2019\n\nWe asked what sort of products Escobar Inc. will sell and Roberto said: \u2018This is remaining a secret my friend. We will only sell the best and the latest products in the world. All legal.\n\n\u2018Yes, in the beginning Pablo and I sold legal products, then it became full of powder.\n\n\u2018Powder that the American Gringos in the big White House call drugs. Those guys are the biggest drug dealers themselves!\n\n\u2018They invented all these powders. I was a poor boy, me and Pablo, all we did, was to sell some goods.\u2019\n\nHowever, he did also admit that it was more difficult to make huge amounts of money when selling legal products and added: \u2018Narcos is very fast and easy money.\n\n\u2018But fast money does not last.\u2019\n\nOlof Gustafsson, CEO of Escobar Inc., said Pablo spent hundreds of millions of dollars \u2018maintaining his image\u2019 and the company which bears his name would continue to legally fight anyone who stood in its way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said: \u2018We are pleased with the outcome.\n\n\u2018We are warning anyone that is doing anything relating to Pablo Escobar or profiting off our name to immediately cease those activities, we will punish anyone legally who is not paying us and not properly licensed or authorized by Escobar Inc.\u2019\n\nWe have written to Elon Musk\u2019s The Boring Company for comment.", "description": "Late cocaine kingpin's relative now sits at the head of a legitimate company bearing his family name.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill", "Science", "Technology Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PRC_75622646_1571746117.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
