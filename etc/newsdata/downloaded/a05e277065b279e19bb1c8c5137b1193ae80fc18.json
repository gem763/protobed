The government says numbers have now started to recover.\n\nDemand for ivory from Asian countries such as China and Vietnam, where it is turned into jewels and ornaments, has driven the surge in poaching across Africa.\n\nHamisi Kigwangalla, minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, said on his Twitter account late on Wednesday the ivory was recovered after authorities arrested suspected \u201chardcore\u201d poacher Hassan Shaban Likwema, also known by the alias Hassan Nyoni.\n\n\u201cThe arrest of Nyoni has brought us to a stage where we can say we have taken into custody all the hardcore poachers on our wanted list, except for a few who have left the country,\u201d Kigwangalla said.\n\n\u201cNyoni and his accomplices\u2019 consignment is worth 4 billion shillings ($1.74 million) and involved the killing of 117 elephants going back to 2015 and earlier,\u201d he said.\n\nNeither Likwema nor his accomplices were immediately reachable for comment.\n\nPictures Kigwangalla posted on his Twitter account showed him inspecting a row consisting of 75 whole tusks and some 338 smaller pieces of ivory.\n\nThe government said in July its anti-poaching efforts had led to a recovery in elephant numbers, which rose to over 60,000 at present.\n\nA Tanzanian court in February sentenced a prominent Chinese businesswoman dubbed the \u201cIvory Queen\u201d to 15 years in prison for smuggling the tusks of more than 350 elephants to Asia, marking a major victory for the government.\n\n($1 = 2,294.0000 Tanzanian shillings)", "description": "Tanzania has seized ivory tusks equivalent to killing at least 117 elephants, its tourism minister said, part of its drive to stamp out organized criminal networks involved in years of industrial-scale poaching.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426480946&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF840SD", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
