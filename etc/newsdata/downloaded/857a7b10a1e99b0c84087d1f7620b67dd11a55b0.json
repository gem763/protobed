It's so great.'\n\nWhat a time: Khloe Kardashian celebrated her clothing line Good American's third anniversary with co-founder Emma Grede on Friday\n\nKhloe used her own personal Instagram that day to plug some new items from her family's online retailer Kardashian Kloset.\n\nThe website currently hawks clothes by Khloe, her siblings Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner and their mother Kris Jenner.\n\nKhloe's eldest sister Kourtney Kardashian, who shares three children with small screen heartthrob Scott Disick, has a 'collection coming soon' on the page.\n\nAfter founding Good American in 2016, Khloe now infamously used it to give a modeling job to Kylie's erstwhile best friend Jordyn Woods.\n\nPlugging away: Khloe used her own personal Instagram that day to plug some new items from her family's online retailer Kardashian Kloset\n\nKhloe wound up leaving her hunky Cleveland Cavalier boyfriend Tristan Thompson this February after he shared a kiss with Jordyn at a party.\n\nTristan, who in recent weeks has posted and deleted gushing comments on Khloe's Instagram, shares a one-year-old daughter with her called True.\n\nLess than 48 hours before Khloe gave birth to True last April, DailyMail.com broke news of Tristan's alleged infidelity with New York strip club bartender Lani Blair.\n\nFamily business: The website currently hawks clothes by Khloe, her siblings Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner and their mother Kris Jenner\n\nEmma told Fashionista last year that 'if you're in the entertainment marketing business, you need to be in business with Kris Jenner.'\n\nShe related the origin story of her fashion brand, remembering that she was in fact introduced to Khloe by the latter's momager.\n\n'I used to meet [Kris] every fashion week in Paris for a little drink and we'd talk about whatever we were working on at that point. I've done Kendall's Calvin [Klein] deal; we've done lots and lots of things together,' she dished.\n\nIncoming: Khloe's eldest sister Kourtney Kardashian, who shares three children with small screen heartthrob Scott Disick, has a 'collection coming soon' on the page\n\n'And I kind of pitched her in a way that was like: \"Hey, I'm doing this thing, and I'd really love Khloe to be my partner,\" and she loved it. She was like: \"This is a great idea, but you have to talk to Khloe. This is not for me.\" I came to LA and I had a meeting with Khloe, and the rest is history, as they say.'\n\nEmma dished: 'As soon as I started speaking, she started joining in on things. She had all these stories, and she'd been bigger. She'd been at different sizes.\n\n'And I think, immediately, this idea that we were going to do this super-empowering, inclusive brand, she was like: \"That's it, I'm in,\" and she started work immediately. No contract, no anything. She was just like: \"Yeah, count me in,\" so it was great.'", "description": "Khloe Kardashian celebrated her clothing line Good American's third anniversary with co-founder Emma Grede on Friday.", "authors": ["Sameer Suri For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/07/19912142-0-image-a-64_1571465235013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
