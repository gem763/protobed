They were fighting over one of El Chapo\u2019s sons, nicknamed \u201cthe mouse\u201d who was arrested but later released in order to end the violence.\n\nThe battle started when a group of police stormed a house belonging to the girlfriend of Ovidio Guzman. They captured him but soon cartel members took over the streets. This video shows some of the cartel gunmen on their way to the fight (the video was taken from WhatsApp):\n\nThose weren\u2019t the biggest weapons that showed up:\n\nEn el centro de #Culiac\u00e1n circulan tambi\u00e9n hombres armados.

Residents took cover indoors as automatic gunfire raged outside. It was the third bloody and terrifying shootout in less than a week between security forces and cartel henchmen, raising questions about whether President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policy of avoiding the use of force and focusing on social ills is working. L\u00f3pez Obrador defended the decision to back down, saying his predecessors\u2019 strategy \u201cturned this country into a cemetery, and we don\u2019t want that anymore.\u201d But Mike Vigil, a former chief of international operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration who worked undercover in Mexico, called the violence \u201ca massive black eye to the Mexican government\u201d and a \u201csign that the cartels are more powerful\u201d than it is.\n\nThat conclusion, that the cartels just showed Mexico who is boss was widely shared:\n\n\u201cThe Sinaloa Cartel demonstrated a tremendous ability to mobilize rapidly and take effective control of the city,\u201d says Raul Benitez, an expert on Latin America\u2019s armed conflicts. \u201cThey showed that in Sinaloa, they are the ones who run things.\u201d In contrast, the Mexican military was in shambles. Officials made contradictory and confusing statements about why the soldiers had gone to Guzman\u2019s house without enough back up. In many points in the city, the cartel gunmen went unchallenged. There were reports that the cartel had held various soldiers hostage and threatened to kill them.\n\nThe NY Times published a story focused on the locals in the city of Culiacan who were happy the government had relented rather than let the battle continue. However, even one of the locals predicts the result of giving in to the cartels once will be future violence:\n\nAs the city tries to get on with life, some residents worry about the repercussions of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez\u2019s release. Once the cartel leaders were able to force the authorities to bend to their will by turning on the population, they might try to do it again, said Osvaldo Garc\u00eda, an employee at a tapestry shop. \u201cThis will cause a reaction similar to a small child throwing tantrums,\u201d said Mr. Garc\u00eda, who saw armed men set fire to a bus to block a road. \u201cThe cartel men will throw violent fits from now on every time they don\u2019t get what they want.\u201d\n\nMexico\u2019s president Obrador has created a new National Guard which was intended to secure the country from cartel violence but most of those troops are reportedly working to prevent caravans of illegal immigrants from making their way to the United States. If he decides to reassign those troops in the wake of this gun battle, that could have an impact down the line on the number of Central Americans arriving at the US border.", "description": "\"They showed that in Sinaloa, they are the ones who run things.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mexico-cartel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
