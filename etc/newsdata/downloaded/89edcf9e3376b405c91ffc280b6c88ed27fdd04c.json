When accused of this, or revealed to have done that, Trump simply blurts \u201cshe did it\u201d or \u201che\u2019s guilty\u201d, whatever the charge may be.\n\nAnd with \u2013 impressive? \u2013 regularity, the tactic seems to work at shifting the broader framing of the story, through a mix of media repetition, Republican complicity, credulous reporting and debunking efforts that nevertheless end up repeating Trump\u2019s claims.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump accused Hillary Clinton of being an accomplice to sexual assault, a racist, a \u201cbirther\u201d, a secret ally to Russia and a dilettante \u201crunning a policy-free campaign\u201d offering \u201conly hatred and division\u201d. Trump partially succeeded in turning Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel investigation of alleged obstruction of justice by him into an expos\u00e9 of his own political opponents. After being accused in July of using racist language to describe Representative Elijah Cummings\u2019 Baltimore district, Trump called Cummings, who is black, \u201cracist\u201d.\n\nNow Trump is the subject of a complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower that Trump pressured a foreign leader for information that could be used to harm former vice-president Joe Biden, who leads Trump by double digits in polling averages.\n\nOn its face, the report would appear to be a serious liability for Trump, exposing him as wielding the diplomatic power of the presidency to keep himself in office, which is definitely not what democracy looks like.\n\nTrump\u2019s response? Boy, Joe Biden has really double-crossed America this time.\n\nTrump is seeking to turn the affair against Biden by peddling a conspiracy theory about a Ukrainian prosecution of a Ukrainian oil company on whose board Hunter Biden, the politician\u2019s son, formerly sat. The theory has been thoroughly debunked .\n\nThat has not stopped the Republican National Committee from producing a \u201cfact\u201d page, titled \u201cQuid Pro Joe\u201d, repeating Trump\u2019s headline claims, in the latest illustration of how completely the party has given itself over to the president. Nor have Republican leaders stepped forward to censure Trump.\n\nBut equally important to the success of Trump\u2019s scheme is the active role of rightwing media, which, with Fox News executives having cycled in and out of the White House and the former press secretary now an employee of Fox News, clearly does not require any active, story-by-story coordination.\n\nThe news outlet Axios highlighted the national ideological split-screen on the Trump-Ukraine story as it played this weekend:\n\nPhilip Bump (@pbump) This is a remarkable juxtaposition, via @axios. pic.twitter.com/SJwWEfBSKr\n\nThe big question attached to Trump\u2019s tactic is whether it will generate enough talk about \u201cBiden\u201d and \u201ccorruption\u201d to dilute the reported new evidence of Trump\u2019s corruption, as laid out in the whistleblower complaint, which the administration has refused to turn over to Congress. The question could have historic consequences, given the surge in demand among Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, for Trump\u2019s impeachment over the matter.\n\nInterviewed by the Associated Press about Trump\u2019s projection of his own faults on his opponents during the last presidential cycle, longtime Republican operative Tucker Martin said the tactic is known to work.\n\n\u201cEssentially you\u2019re delegitimizing their attack by simply muddying the water, and saying, \u2018We\u2019re all guilty, now what?\u2019\u201d Martin told AP.\n\nOther commentators, including Jonathan Chait writing in New York magazine, have noted that \u201cthe inexhaustible fire hose of Trumpian misconduct\u201d has ironically made wild counter-attacks by him a low-risk strategy, since most people have already made up their minds about him.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s base is almost immune to news of misconduct by him, while the Democratic base is highly sensitive to it,\u201d wrote Chait. \u201cIt\u2019s therefore plausible for Trump to assume that a story that combines unsubstantiated allegations against people in his opponent\u2019s orbit with massive, undisguised abuse of power by Trump himself is a net win.\u201d\n\nBolstering Trump\u2019s image-maintenance accomplices in the media and Congress are those power-holders closest to him, including the vice-president and members of the cabinet, some of whom have matched Trump himself for turning substantial and alarming allegations into ugly and spearheaded counter-attacks.\n\nIn an appearance on CBS News\u2019 Face the Nation program on Sunday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, was asked whether it was \u201cappropriate\u201d for Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who for months has been Trump\u2019s man on the ground in Ukraine, to call for an investigation of Biden, as Giuliani has done.\n\n\u201cIf there was election interference that took place by the vice-president,\u201d Pompeo replied, \u201cI think the American people deserve to know.\u201d", "description": "The president\u2019s tactic of redirecting accusations of misconduct back at his accuser is childish, petty \u2026 and surprisingly effective", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df0fea14713f71ec09b8b235e4ff02299b31d77c/0_18_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d35d801392d44c9bb96187914214baff", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
