International weakness triggering a manufacturing slowdown? A potentially overconfident consumer and a Fed caught up in a brief interest-rate cutting cycle, regardless of steady GDP growth? And, of course, an impeachment inquiry.\n\nDoes this sound like a recipe for a strong fourth-quarter rally?\n\nWell, in 1998, it sure was, according to BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel, who pointed out that the similarities between then and now are \u201ctoo striking\u201d to ignore.\n\nIn our call of the day, he suggests the pent-up caution that\u2019s \u201cbordering on pessimism\u201d due to mounting political tensions at home and abroad could lead to an end-of-year run should outcomes prove more positive than expected.\n\n\u201cSimilar to 1998, where stocks rallied for 18 months (advancing 68%) from the cyclical low to the point of maximum public bullishness, the 3/2000 \u2018Tech Bubble Top,\u2019\u201dhe wrote, \u201cwe expect the current four-month S&P 500 trading range to resolve with new all-time highs as the prospect of higher interest rates... results in fund flows to stocks and the public\u2019s eventual embracing of the \u2018most hated bull market of all-time.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe downside: We all remember \u2014 or should \u2014 what happened in the aftermath of that \u201cpoint of maximum public bullishness.\u201d\n\nThe market\n\nThe stock market doesn\u2019t seem too concerned with all the negative headlines lately. Futures on the Dow YM00, +0.25% , S&P ES00, +0.29% and Nasdaq NQ00, +0.43% are all trading higher while gold GC00, -0.85% stalls out in the red.\n\nGlobally, European markets SXXP, -0.04% are mostly higher and Asia ADOW, -0.26% closed with gains.\n\nBitcoin BTCUSD, +0.59% is hovering just about the $8,000 mark struggling to bounce back from its worst weekly price loss of the year. The digital currency was above $10,000 just a week ago, but has since fallen about 20%.\n\nThe buzz\n\nFashion retailer Forever 21 is closing up to 178 of its stores as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The one-time teen hot spot, which fell victim to those finicky consumer tastes, once boasted more than 800 stores across 57 countries.\n\nCongressional antitrust investigators, the Wall Street Journal reported, are scrutinizing plans by Alphabet\u2019s GOOG, -1.31% Google to use a new internet protocol, concerned that it could give the company a competitive advantage by making it harder for others to access consumer data. Google responded that it has \u201cno plans to centralize or change people\u2019s DNS providers to Google by default.\u201d\n\nThe chart\n\nFor the first time since 2011, U.S. housing markets are not at risk of a bubble. At least, that\u2019s according to a new report from UBS, which looks at housing markets across the world. Munich takes the title of most overvalued.\n\nThe tweet\n\nYes, October in a pre-election year saw the S&P 500 crash 21.8% in 1987.\n\n\n\nThis is true.\n\n\n\nBut here's what it has done in October since:\n\n'91 +1.2%\n\n'95 -0.5%\n\n'99 +6.3%\n\n'03 +5.5%\n\n'07 +1.5%\n\n'11 +10.8%\n\n'15 +8.3%\n\n'19 ???? \u2014 Ryan Detrick, CMT (@RyanDetrick) September 30, 2019\n\nThe economy\n\nThe jobs report on Friday is the cherry on top of a pretty busy week of data, which includes today\u2019s tandem of the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index at 9:45 a.m. Eastern and the Dallas Fed manufacturing survey 45 minutes after that. Car sales hit later in the week, and we\u2019ll also hear from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday.\n\nThe quote\n\nReuters President Donald Trump is having a rough one.\n\n\u201cAnd just like with Nixon, just like with this whistleblower complaint, it\u2019s going to happen very quickly. I\u2019m not saying that Trump is gonna be gone tomorrow, I\u2019m just saying the tide is going to turn, when it does, very fast for the Republican Congresspeople, they\u2019re going to be very supportive until one day ... they aren\u2019t. So the system survives. Isn\u2019t that what it\u2019s all about?\u201d \u2014 longtime critic and blogger Bob Leftsetz, predicting that a Trump resignation is on the way.\n\nTrump, tweeting about the impeachment inquiry, claimed he has been framed and discredited the whistleblower.\n\nRandom reads\n\nThe Wall Street billionaire\u2019s guide to buying your kids a better shot at not just one elite college, but lots of them.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people are reading full novels on Instagram.\n\nHistory buff?
