If smoke is coming out from under the hood of your car, if you notice puddles of oil under it, if the engine is overheating and you smell burning oil, you don\u2019t have to be a car mechanic to know that something is wrong with your car.\n\nAccepting the reality about Trump\u2019s disordered personality is important and even essential. For one thing, it will help us to better react to Trump\u2019s freak show.\n\nEven now, almost a thousand days into his presidency, the latest Trump outrage elicits shock and disbelief in people. The reaction is, \u201cCan you believe he said that and did this?\u201d\n\nTo which my response is, \u201cWhy are you surprised?\u201d It\u2019s a shock only if the assumption is that we\u2019re dealing with a psychologically normal human being. We\u2019re not. Trump is profoundly compromised, acting just as you would imagine a person with a disordered personality would. Many Americans haven\u2019t yet come to terms with the fact that we elected as president a man who is deeply damaged, an emotional misfit. But it would be helpful if they did.", "description": "", "authors": ["Peter Wehner", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Donald-Trump-Not-Well"], "top_image": ""}
