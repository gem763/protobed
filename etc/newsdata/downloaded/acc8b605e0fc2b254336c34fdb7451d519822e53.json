Then the former Manchester United striker slotted in to give Inter a 3-1 lead.\n\nWith the game under control Conte brought on winger Matteo Politano and midfielder Valentino Lazaro for their first appearances this season.\n\nThen Filip Djuricic (74) and Jeremie Boga (81) hit back for the hosts, who are struggling in 17th position, to add to Domenic Berardi\u2019s first-half goal.\n\nInter held on for a win after consecutive defeats against Barcelona in the Champions League and Juventus in Serie A.\n\n\u201cOnce it goes to 3-1 and 4-1, it should be over,\u201d said Lukaku who has now scored five Serie A goals in eight games.\n\n\u201cIn the first half, we did everything well. However, we should have scored in the first 15 minutes after the restart to really kill off the match.\n\n\u201cThe positive we take is that we got the three points, but we need to defend better than that.\n\n\u201cIt was very important to get this win.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Pioli\u2019s proteges spoil Milan debut \u2013\n\nMeanwhile, Pioli\u2019s debut as Milan coach was spoiled by two players he previously coached \u2014 Khouma Babacar and Marco Calderoni.\n\nBabacar cancelled out Turkish winger Hakan Calhanoglu\u2019s first-half goal, when the Senegalese forward missed a penalty but turned in the rebound after an hour in the San Siro.\n\nKrzysztof Piatek came off the bench and scored with nine minutes to go after a Calhanoglu pull back, but Calderoni rifled in the equaliser in stoppage time.\n\n\u201cTonight I suffered because of my exes,\u201d said Pioli.\n\n\u201cI had hoped for a gift this evening for my birthday, but I saw some good things, the team deserved a win, but it was our own fault we didn\u2019t,\u201d added the former Fiorentina coach, who turned 54 on Sunday.\n\nMilan are in 12th with ten points from eight games. Lecce are one point above the relegation zone.\n\nClaudio Ranieri\u2019s first game in charge of basement club Sampdoria also ended in a goalless draw in Genoa against his former club Roma on his 68th birthday.\n\nThe visitors lost Bryan Cristante and Nikola Kalinic to injury early, with coach Paulo Fonseca sitting out a touchline ban.\n\nEdin Dzeko came on for Kalinic with his face protected by a mask after breaking a cheekbone two weeks ago.\n\nThe Romans played the final five minutes a man down after Justin Kluivert was sent off for a second yellow card.\n\nThe match was also overshadowed by monkey chants directed at Sampdoria midfielder Ronaldo Vieira for which the Roman club apologised and vowed to identify and ban those involved.\n\nThe Guinea Bissau-born, English footballer later wrote on Instagram: \u201cFootball has a responsibility to punish and educate the idiots in the stadium today.\u201d\n\nRoma fall to sixth in the table behind Cagliari who beat SPAL 2-0 as Sampdoria stay bottom but take their first point in four games.\n\nRanieri said he had made progress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m satisfied especially after only a week training together and against a very good Roma,\u201d said the former Leicester City coach.\n\n\u201cNow let me have time to get to know the players and then we will try to find solutions to score.\u201d\n\nParma move up to eighth after substitute Andreas Cornelius scored a hat-trick in a 5-1 hammering of lowly Genoa as Stefano Okaka\u2019s header was enough to get struggling Udinese past Torino slipped to 10th.", "description": "Milan (AFP) \u2013 Inter Milan survived a late Sassuolo scare and a bizarre intervention by a parachutist to win 4-3 and keep in touch with leaders", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/5d8e7f_romelu-lukaku-scored-brace-inter-milan-bring-his-tally-goals-in-league-games-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
