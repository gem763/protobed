She was later brought down by a police climber.\n\n\u201cRebels have glued themselves to the building and co-founder, Gail Bradbrook has climbed on top of roof at entrance in civil disobedience due to our government complicit inaction on the climate and ecological emergency we are facing,\u201d Extinction Rebellion said.\n\nExtinction Rebellion, which uses civil disobedience to highlight the risks posed by climate change and the accelerating loss of plant and animal species, is midway through a new two-week wave of actions in cities around the world.\n\nPolice ordered a halt to all Extinction Rebellion protests in London on Monday after a week action, saying those who did not comply would be arrested. They have already made almost 1,500 arrests since the protests began.\n\nThe group said High Speed 2 project (HS2), aimed at improving links from London to central and northern England but which is billions of pounds over budget and running late, would damage or destroy 108 ancient woodlands.\n\nA spokesman for the transport ministry declined immediate comment on the action.\n\nAnother activist tried to lock herself to the transport ministry but was arrested.\n\n\u201cEverybody who is not paying attention is numb at the moment. We all use tactics to numb ourselves because this is scary,\u201d the arrested woman said.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nShe said the high speed rail project would be a \u201cscar across the belly of this land\u201d and that it would destroy vital woodlands and wildlife habitats.\n\nThe project aims to slash journey times between the capital and Birmingham, which supporters say would give Britain the kind of fast rail services enjoyed by other major countries.\n\nAn independent review is considering whether it should go ahead given that it would cost around 88 billion pounds ($111.5 billion) under current estimates.", "description": "Climate change activists, including one of the founders of Extinction Rebellion, targeted Britain's transport ministry in central London on Tuesday to protest against a proposed high-speed rail project known as HS2.", "authors": ["Matthew Green", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441082562&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0DT", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
