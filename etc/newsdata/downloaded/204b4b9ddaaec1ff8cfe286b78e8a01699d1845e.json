Please sign it if you wish to repel the snivelling snowflakes & keep me in my job.\u2019\n\nIn another post, he added: \u2018Spread the word, my people\u2026 Sign, RT, and save me as your voice against the shriekingly illiberal liberals who want to cancel everyone who dares challenge them\u2026\u2019\n\nBREAKING: There is now a rival petition to save me on @GMB.\n\nThank you Margaret Lowry!\n\nPlease sign it if you wish to repel the snivelling snowflakes & keep me in my job: https://t.co/oWxIhaLL7t \u2014 Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) October 13, 2019\n\nSpread the word, my people\u2026\n\nSign, RT, and save me as your voice against the shriekingly illiberal liberals who want to cancel everyone who dares challenge them\u2026 https://t.co/oWxIhaLL7t \u2014 Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) October 13, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe description of the campaign, which so far has 2,414 supporters, reads: \u2018Keep Piers Morgan for his common-sense approach to life. He\u2019s also funny!!\n\n\u2018He\u2019s not afraid to speak out and says what a lot of us are thinking.\u2019\n\nThe petition comes days after angry viewers called for Piers to be removed from Good Morning Britain for his treatment of the LGBT+ community.\n\n\u2018Morgan dictates to his viewers that it\u2019s acceptable to deny an LGBTQ+ person of their rights; it\u2019s acceptable to tell them they don\u2019t exist; it\u2019s acceptable to call them \u201csnowflakes\u201d when they get rightfully upset,\u2019 part of the petition\u2019s description reads.\n\n\u2018These are the lessons Morgan teaches. ITV, as a major broadcasting corporation with a worldwide reach, are currently tarnishing a long-lasting legacy by using one of their highest-performing programmes as a vehicle to spread hate and intolerance.\u2019\n\nIt goes on to add: \u2018I understand that viewers are important, numbers mean business and high engagement suggests success, but are there really no other ways to achieve it? Despite Good Morning Britain\u2019s current performance, to be conscious of a majority of their viewership being sexist, racist, transphobic, and generally unwilling to accept minorities or viewpoints aside from their own is repulsive, for lack of a better term\u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Wake up to the reality of Morgan\u2019s behaviour. Hate crimes are on the rise, transphobia and discrimination over gender identity is becoming commonplace both upon social media and in the real world, and ITV continue to sit idly and let it play out in the name of entertainment.\n\n\u2018It should be obvious by now that this has far surpassed an acceptable threshold, with Morgan\u2019s rhetoric and actions sitting firmly in dangerous territory.\u2019\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
