The team, however, maintains they had never heard such a thing.\n\nAngels President John Camino said the team \"never heard that any employee was providing illegal narcotics to any player,\" nor were they aware of any players looking for illegal narcotics.\n\n\"The Angels maintain a strict, zero tolerance policy regarding the illicit use of drugs for both players and staff,\" he said in a statement. \"Every one of our players must also abide by the MLB joint Drug Agreement. We continue to mourn the loss of Tyler and fully cooperate with the authorities as they continue their investigation.\"\n\nThe report stated that Eric Kay, the Angels' director of communications, personally provided Skaggs with oxycodone \u2014 and used it himself \u2014 for years. Skaggs, 27, was found dead in a Texas hotel room from choking on his vomit after drinking alcohol and taking fentanyl and oxycodone, according to the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office.\n\nESPN reported that Kay gave three oxycodone pills to Skaggs a day or two before the baseball team left for Texas to play in a series against the Rangers. Hours before Skaggs' death, he allegedly snorted three lines of crushed opioids \u2014 two Kay recognized as oxycodone and one that he did not recognize.\n\nTwo team officials allegedly knew of Skaggs' drug use, according to Kay. Tim Mead, the former Angels vice president of communications and Kay's supervisor, allegedly became aware of the situation in 2017 and again this April when Kay was recovering from an overdose and received a text from Skaggs seeking drugs.\n\nHe also told them the names of five other people who used drugs while they played for the Angels, according to ESPN. Mead denied the allegations.\n\nSkaggs' family attorney, Rusty Hardin, told ESPN that they look forward to the results of the DEA's investigation.\n\n\"The Skaggs family continues to mourn the loss of a beloved son, brother, husband and son-in-law,\" he said. \"They greatly appreciate the work that law enforcement is doing, and they are patiently awaiting the results of the investigation.\"", "description": "ESPN reported Saturday that the Angels knew of late pitcher Tyler Skaggs' drug use \"long before his death\"", "authors": ["Li Cohen"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/13/884008fd-e1ed-42b6-b950-b65dfcc2b3a0/thumbnail/1200x630/b761449f4ab0463eb8b8d3c790ec8b14/gettyimages-1155364619.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
