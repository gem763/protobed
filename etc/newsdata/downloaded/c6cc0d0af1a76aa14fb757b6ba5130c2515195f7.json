Oh no pic.twitter.com/3Gev5Dh24x \u2014 Mickstape (@MickstapeShow) October 23, 2019\n\nThe internet did not take kindly to James\u2019 ill-timed and disrespectful outburst:\n\nIf this was the Chinese anthem @KingJames would have showed the proper respect https://t.co/a5yUyXo1dm \u2014 Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) October 23, 2019\n\nLeBron was yelling for them to play China\u2019s anthem @MickstapeShow pic.twitter.com/eeV4ZdvnS5 \u2014 Barstool Sports (@barstoolsports) October 23, 2019\n\nLeBron may truly have zero respect for America. National anthem still going and he walks off and yells \u201cLET\u2019S GO\u201d to the crowd. His behavior the past month is indefensible. pic.twitter.com/Ql0T8a2QC2 \u2014 T.J. Moe (@TJMoe28) October 23, 2019\n\nWhat a classless disrespectful move to the country that gave you the opportunity to make billions of dollars @KingJames. You\u2019re more than welcome to leave anytime you want and don\u2019t come back. Put your hand over your heart and say thank you. https://t.co/72bihf44wu \u2014 Turner Wintz (@19tmoney19) October 23, 2019\n\nLeBron James you are a hypocrite I disrespectful unappreciative spoiled rotten little b**** ass mother f***** you disrespect the national anthem you talk about respecting the American troops and all this other crap I'm a veteran a f*** you f*** you the hell \u2014 2nd Amendment Fighter (@Fighter2nd) October 23, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s game 1 of the regular season and Lebron is already disrespecting our National Anthem and our country smh https://t.co/JovkQcwsVs \u2014 cole (@colem008) October 23, 2019\n\nJames faced a firestorm of criticism after saying that Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey \u201cwasn\u2019t educated\u201d on the China-Hong-Kong issue, before he sent a message of support to pro-democracy protesters earlier this month.\n\nWhile backpedaling, James said that he is not a politician, and said that not \u201cevery issue should be everyone\u2019s problem.\u201d\n\nSince that time, James has said he will no longer talk about the NBA-China rift. The Lakers star forward also did not have any comment about his disrespect towards the flag on Tuesday night.\n\nThe NBA faced serious financial hardship after China retaliated against the league by canceling promotional events and several business arrangements. It should also be noted that James has several financial interests in China outside the NBA. Most notably, Nike\u2019s extremely lucrative sales in China, plus the deal that James\u2019 production company has in the development of Space Jam 2 which is expected to do very well in the communist country.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "The NBA was understandably excited to start its season and get away from the China controversy that had embroiled the league over the past", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/sean-m-haffey-gty-640x480-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
