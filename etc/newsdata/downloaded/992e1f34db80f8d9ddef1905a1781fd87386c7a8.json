REUTERS/Ina Fassbender//Files\n\nIndustrial output rose 0.3% on the month, Statistics Office figures showed on Tuesday, against expectations of a 0.1% drop.\n\nThe rise was driven by production of intermediate and capital goods, the Economy Ministry said. Manufacturing rose 0.7% while construction fell by 1.5%, the data showed.\n\nGermany\u2019s export-dependent manufacturing sector is already in recession. That has dragged on the economy as a whole, which shrank in the second quarter. Economists expect another slight economic contraction in the July-September period.\n\nUncertainties linked to Britain\u2019s planned departure from the European Union and global trade disputes are starting to hurt Germany\u2019s labour market, which has been the backbone of a consumption-driven growth cycle as exports weaken.\n\n\u201cGiven that industrial output provides us with a deep look into the economic development in the third quarter, one could entertain the idea that the German economy will just about avoid a recession,\u201d Thomas Gitzel of VP Bank wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cBut unfortunately one must consider the industrial production data for August as a flash in the pan,\u201d he added. \u201cWe expect production in September to be negative. This means that GDP will contract at least slightly in the third quarter.\u201d\n\nSTIMULUS NEEDED\n\nJuly\u2019s output reading was revised up to a fall of 0.4% from a previously reported drop of 0.6%. On Monday, data showed that industrial orders had fallen more than expected in August on weaker domestic demand.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s right-left coalition government has resisted calls for a substantial spending package to offset the slowdown and put the economy back on a growth path.\n\nPeter Vanden Houte of ING warned it was too early to talk about a trend reversal in German manufacturing despite August\u2019s rise in output, adding that the big picture remains negative.\n\n\u201cThe omen remains bleak,\u201d he wrote in a note. \u201cAs long as world trade stagnates, German industry and by extension the whole German economy is almost certainly bound to languish.\u201d\n\nProlonged weakness in Germany, a bellwether for the economic health of the euro zone, would be a headache for the European Central Bank, which in September pledged indefinite stimulus to revive the bloc\u2019s economy.\n\nEconomists and German business lobby groups have urged Merkel to ditch her policy of no new debt and borrow to fund a stimulus package for the economy.\n\nPressure on her to act will intensify if the economy continues to weaken.\n\n\u201cWe believe that at the beginning of next year, additional budgetary stimulus might be put in place, paving the way for an economic upturn in the course of 2020,\u201d said ING\u2019s Vanden Houte.", "description": "German industrial output rose unexpectedly in August but analysts said the small pickup did not signal the end of a months-long manufacturing contraction that risks tipping Europe's biggest economy into recession.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438346203&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970DC", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
