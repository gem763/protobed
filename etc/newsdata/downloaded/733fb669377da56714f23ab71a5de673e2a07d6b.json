I think even Sam Whitelock struck out a pukana (facial expression).\"\n\nThe All Blacks are globally famous for doing the haka before international rugby tests, although Perenara says they don't practice \"Kapa o Pango\" and the much older and more frequently used \"Ka Mate\" much.\n\n\"If we need any top-ups or extra work, we'll find a slot throughout the week,\" Perenara says. \"Often, newer players in the environment need work on it, I'll do some one-on-one time with him.\n\n\"It's an honor to be in that conversation when people think of the All Blacks haka and put my name next to it. You don't hold that (haka leader) role forever, so while I have the honor I'll do it to the best of my ability.\"\n\nRead says the enhanced version they showed against South Africa 10 days ago in Yokohama might have been a little too good.\n\n\"We were a bit overeager once we started the game from it,\" he says. \"It's something we'll work on through the tournament.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014Sports", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
