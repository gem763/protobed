Investors are likely to channel the money back into the market, says Rainer Guntermann, a strategist at Commerzbank AG (DE: ), helping fuel this year\u2019s record-breaking bond rally.\n\nYields on the region\u2019s debt have tumbled to record lows this year as investors seek refuge from a slowing global economy, Brexit uncertainty and simmering U.S.-China trade tensions. Bond payouts may dwindle in November but the ECB is likely to offset this when it unleashes fresh quantitative easing at the rate of 20 billion euros per month.\n\nOctober is set to be \u201cthe year\u2019s most market-friendly month from a net cash flow perspective\u201d say Cagdas Aksu and Max Kitson, fixed income analysts at Barclays (LON: ), while Commerzbank\u2019s Guntermann thinks the bonds will climb in the coming five weeks.\n\nFrance will pay out the largest amount in October, with some 55 billion euros of bond redemptions and coupons, according to Barclays (LON: ). During the same month it estimates the nation will sell 20 billion euros of debt.\n\nOctober\u2019s bond payments compare with April\u2019s total of 102 billion euros and 130 billion euros 12 months ago.", "description": "Europe's Bond Markets Set for Cash Windfall Before QE Begins", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic53323c3eb20747159a1616e58d3d52d0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
