All right. I get it. Just lie. Use the media to lie,\u2019\u201d Gibney said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize what a manufactured character he was. What a TV-manufactured character. He learned the lessons of television very well. He wasn\u2019t a kind of born politician. The people around him, their ability to use TV to create this larger-than-life James Bond-like figure\u2014that took over.\u201d\n\nGibney sees obvious parallels in the way the reality-TV star Donald Trump used his media persona and endless TV appearances to win the presidency.\n\nEven more alarmingly, there\u2019s a clear parallel with the way Putin gaslights his entire nation.\n\n\u2018Going Clear\u2019 Filmmaker Alex Gibney: Harvey Weinstein Is Just the Beginning\n\nPussy Riot\u2019s Nadya on the Disturbing Putin-Trump Bromance: \u2018He\u2019d Love to Have as Much Power as Putin\u2019\n\nThe film includes a section on Putin telling obvious, outright lies about the attempted murder of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, in southwest England. At the time, Putin backed the claims made on camera by two Russian intelligence agents, who were caught on CCTV heading to Salisbury on the day of the nerve-agent attack, saying they had flown to England simply to see the local cathedral and hoped to squeeze in a trip to Stonehenge.\n\n\u201cTalking about the whole Skripal attempted killings, it\u2019s like Putin is saying: \u2018We\u2019re obviously lying. We don\u2019t care that you know we\u2019re lying. And by the way, we\u2019re going to do it anyway. So go fuck yourselves.\u2019 It\u2019s like Trump saying, \u2018There were more people at my inauguration than any other inauguration in history.\u2019 You can look at the photographs. You don\u2019t have to count the numbers. It\u2019s a lie. But maybe more than a lie, it\u2019s bullshit,\u201d Gibney said.\n\n\u201cBut you promote it, and it\u2019s weirdly effective for the people who want to be behind you. It\u2019s like you\u2019re rooting for the balls, not for the brain.\u201d\n\nOf course, Putin used his mendacious television strategy to quash dissent and then to twist the spirit of Russia\u2019s constitution to allow himself to retain power beyond the two-term limit. It\u2019s hard to imagine him stepping down anytime soon without a fight.\n\n\u201cThe classic example is Xi Jinping in China,\u201d said Gibney. \u201cHe\u2019s announced he\u2019s gonna stay there. Will Putin do that? That will be the really interesting moment coming up. Will they find some mechanism to allow him to continue on in power?\u201d\n\nOne of the most striking sections of the movie shows Gibney asking Khodorkovsky, once Russia\u2019s richest man and now an exiled opposition figure, what he thought was Putin\u2019s biggest nightmare. \u201cHe took me literally, which I found fascinating,\u201d said Gibney.\n\nKhodorkovsky, who founded the anti-Putin Open Russia organization, described a nightmare scenario in which the Kremlin phones suddenly stop working and no one answers Putin\u2019s calls for assistance. He realizes this means the game is up and the gangsters are coming for him.\n\n\u201cOne way to avoid that eventuality is to make sure that you never leave,\u201d said Gibney. \u201cIf the gangsters think you\u2019re leaving office, then you\u2019re not useful to them anymore.\u201d\n\nSomething similar must be rushing through Trump\u2019s head as congressional inquiries, federal probes, and tax investigations mount.\n\n\u201cI think in the back of everyone\u2019s minds they\u2019re terrified of the idea that whether Trump loses in 2020 or whether he gets another four years, how can he imagine stepping down?\u201d said Gibney.\n\n\u201cSo many norms have been bent and twisted out of shape.\u201d\n\nMikhail Khodorkovsky Greenwich Entertainment More", "description": "Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast/Photos GettyLONDON\u2014One of America\u2019s leading documentary-makers set off on a project to examine the extraordinary life of Russian dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and came away with the discomforting realization that President Trump is morphing into Vladimir", "authors": ["Nico Hines"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0BBVmahxjru6OLiv68iVjA--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/be8e046e9fa63e0d99ed8102e08bf104", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
