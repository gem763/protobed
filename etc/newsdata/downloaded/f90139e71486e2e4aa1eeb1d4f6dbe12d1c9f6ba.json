Warren/Associated Press)\n\nPerhaps the quietest good coaching job is ongoing in Berkeley, Calif., with at least two reasons for the quiet.\n\nOne would be that it\u2019s Berkeley, long noted for aspects beyond football, as when an Ole Miss fan last week accused the visiting Cal team of communism, a revelation to anyone who has checked Bay Area hotel prices.\n\nThe other would be that it\u2019s Justin Wilcox, the 42-year-old California Golden Bears coach with the notable lack of attention-neediness, and who on Monday with reporters, said this: \u201cI like to listen more than I like to talk.\u201d As a reporter said, \u201cWe have noticed,\u201d Wilcox continued: \u201cHe\u2019s a great person to sit next to in the conference meeting.\u201d\n\nThat referred to the talkative Herman Edwards, the famous Arizona State coach, former New York Jets coach, former Kansas City Chiefs coach and former ESPN coach-on-air. He\u2019s the latest visiting coach headed into California Memorial Stadium, this one on Friday night, and it\u2019s telling that he\u2019s the obvious, overriding theme, even as Wilcox\u2019s Bears (4-0) enter as the Pacific-12 Conference\u2019s last unbeaten team.\n\nAs much as it\u2019s about California trying to build on wins at Washington and Mississippi, it\u2019s about Edwards, as young a 65 as anybody ever saw, returning to where he began college football. Reminded about the prowess of California safety Ashtyn Davis, Edwards told reporters in Arizona: \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell him my record is still in the book, if you\u2019d like to break it. It\u2019s still sitting there, four interceptions in one game, against Washington State (in 1972). \u2026 First one was for a touchdown. Still sits in the books. No one\u2019s broken that yet. So I\u2019m gonna tell him, \u2018You go ahead and get it, \u2019cause it\u2019s still sitting there.' \u201d\n\nThen, a quick caveat: \u201cNot today.\u201d\n\n[Penn State vs. Maryland: Preview, TV info and game coverage]\n\nGiven that his Arizona State stands 3-1 with a hard and bumpy 10-7 win at Michigan State, it\u2019s a good night in the Pac-12, where the members annually chew up each other in the kind of parity feast that threatens College Football Playoff presence. (Pac-12 representatives have appeared only twice in five four-team playoffs so far.) It\u2019s a game that could end up 10-7 itself, with the way Wilcox has lent a ruggedness to California, which last December became the first team ever to lose a game called the Cheez-It Bowl, but lost it nobly, to TCU, by 10-7, in overtime.\n\nCalifornia is, of course, often described with the ancient English passage \u201chasn\u2019t reached a Rose Bowl since 1959,\u201d even if it did get rooked out of a berth in 2004. After it reached seven straight bowl games in the 2000s, it has settled for three across this decade, even if it does boast two of the NFL\u2019s most prominent starting quarterbacks, Aaron Rodgers and Jared Goff. It spent the middle part of these 2010s with Sonny Dykes\u2019s Air Raid offense, with total offense rankings like No. 13 (2014), No. 8 (2015) and No. 10 (2016).\n\nThen in January 2017, the school ended Dykes\u2019s four-season tenure after the last three years sailed sideways to 18-19, and brought in the absurdly prepared Wilcox. He had assistant-coached at six schools (including California) in all four continental time zones, with the unusual parlay of Boise State, Tennessee and Wisconsin. That all began after a playing career at Oregon in which clues of a coaching future developed, and a quick stop as an undrafted free agent with the Washington Redskins, who released him in June 2000 to make room for fullback Odell Collins.\n\nWilcox at California has added up to a 16-13 record so far but with three of the wins absolute stunners: 37-3 in 2017 over unbeaten Washington State (which doesn\u2019t tend to do \u201c3\u201d), 12-10 in 2018 over Washington, and 20-19 in 2019 at Washington, one of the upsets of the young season. It was that strange game where strange, severe weather in Seattle prompted a kickoff at 10:30 p.m. and a finish at 1:22 a.m., and where California went 74 yards in the closing two minutes for Greg Thomas\u2019s winning field goal from 17 yards.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just really proud of the team because it wasn\u2019t the cleanest, but they just keep fighting and they\u2019re just a tough bunch of buys, and really appreciate them for that,\u201d Wilcox said.\n\nThat\u2019s how the coach wanted it when he signed on: teams that would be \u201cstrong and tough\u201d in a pinball-scoreboard era. California\u2019s scores so far have tilted toward strong-and-tough: 27-13, 20-19, 23-17, 28-20. \u201cThe good thing is our team has pretty dang good self-awareness,\u201d Wilcox said this week, \u201cand they realize how small the margins are in winning and losing.\u201d\n\nThat kind of approach probably wasn\u2019t forecast for Wilcox in the mid-1990s, when he came out of high school as a celebrated quarterback from Junction City, Ore., near Eugene, after two straight years of 2,000-plus yards passing. But he opted for defense when the Oregon depth chart didn\u2019t smile upon his quarterbacking, and even within that he made the tricky transition from safety to corner. He became that college football subspecies: the player chronically lauded for selflessness and, of course, quiet.\n\nThat, too, was unexpected, because as he once told the Oregonian, \u201cI got out of the gene pool somewhere.\u201d He meant at the time that his tall, slender build, which he keeps at 42, differed from that of his older brother Josh, the former Oregon tight end who caught seven passes for the New Orleans Saints, and his father Dave Wilcox, who wore that big, brutish No. 64 in 11 seasons as a San Francisco 49ers linebacker on the way to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nIn Dave Wilcox\u2019s Hall of Fame bio, it reads, \u201cAlways prepared, Wilcox was a true student of the game and worked to be fundamentally correct.\u201d And: \u201c\u2018What I do best,\u2019 Wilcox once stated, \u2018is not let people block me. I just hate to be blocked.\u2019\u201d The Wilcoxes had raised their sons on an Oregon farm boasting wheat and cherries, and now the younger one heads the Pac-12\u2019s last unbeaten team in 2019, a team of which Edwards said, \u201cDefense is the calling card.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s even as, with a listener as a coach and a star coach about to play visitor, one might have to look carefully to notice.\n\nRead more:\n\nBarry Svrluga: Maryland and Penn State coaches are joined at the roots\n\nVirginia football visits Notre Dame with hopes of taking a big step in its ascent\n\nJerry Brewer: Punishing Kansas might elicit fear, but the NCAA will need to do more to earn respect\n\nJohn Feinstein: App State, still the biggest little college football program going\n\nCollege football has Rivalry Week, Week Zero and now Redshirt Week", "description": "The quiet Justin Wilcox and the loquacious Herman Edwards meet for a big Pac-12 game with a score that might not fit in a pinball era.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports.", "September At Am", "Chuck Culpepper Covers National College Sports", "As Well As Some Tennis", "Some Golf"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/z96sgx2YNoE6KQoTc6Bu9g7Qai8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JMDUXOGWNII6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
