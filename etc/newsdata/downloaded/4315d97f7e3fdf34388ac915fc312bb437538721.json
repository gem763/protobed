Then they started dating.\n\n'It got serious pretty quickly,' said Legend.\n\n'She just entertained the hell out of me, texting me.

I didn't know that I wanted someone funny until I was actually with someone funny.'\n\nA family of four: The famous parents with their kids in December 2018\n\nHe likes her wit: 'She just entertained the hell out of me, texting me. What people respond to in her tweets today was the same energy in those texts. I didn't know that I wanted someone funny until I was actually with someone funny.' Seen in 2016\n\nAnd they wasted no time starting a family.\n\nTheir children are daughter Luna Simone, aged three, and son Miles Theodore, aged one.\n\nIn the new article, the couple also wasted no time getting to the subject of their dislike of President Donald Trump, who has famously lashed out at both Chrissy and John on Twitter.\n\n'We know this president has a particular aversion to strong women coming after him, particularly women of color,' the singer told Vanity Fair.\n\nGetting to it: The couple also wasted no time getting to the subject of their dislike for President Donald Trump, who has famously lashed out at both Chrissy and John on Twitter\n\nReady to vote: 'My favorite\u2014I\u2019m going to say it, we\u2019ll break news today\u2014is Elizabeth Warren,' said Legend. Here Warren is seen on Saturday in South Carolina\n\n'So he had to call [Chrissy] out. Every time he does something like this, he just makes himself look more terrible. I don\u2019t know that that incrementally convinces anyone not to vote for him, but he just proves himself to be a sh**ty human being.'\n\nThey also announced who they will be voting for in 2020.\n\n'My favorite\u2014I\u2019m going to say it, we\u2019ll break news today\u2014is Elizabeth Warren,' said Legend.\n\n'She\u2019s the best candidate running today and she comes at it with joy and with sincerity and with a wealth of knowledge and experience.'\n\n'I love Elizabeth Warren,' added Teigen. 'I also love Kamala Harris.'\n\n'Honestly, I don\u2019t comprehend why guys hate women so much sometimes,' said John.\n\n'You see someone as transparently competent and eloquent and on fire as Elizabeth Warren and then you hear some guys just are not into voting for a woman. Why do guys feel so threatened by the idea of a woman president?'\n\nLive in mommy: Chrissy's mother Vilailuck Teigen lives with the power couple at their LA home\n\n'Our menses,' Teigen said to her husband. 'Because there\u2019s 10 days a month where we\u2019re just going to war.'\n\nChrissy also talked to Vanity Fair about when she first met John and made little money as a model: 'I had no credit cards, I didn\u2019t have a bank account, and it just didn\u2019t occur to me to ask my dad for money. I knew exactly how much it was with tax to get a McDouble and fries,' she said.\n\nChrissy also suffers from anxiety which was brought on by her mother's despair after the death of her husband. The Lip Sync Battle host shared that often her mother was just not there for her.\n\nChrissy says she would search online to see if John was gay or dating models (the singer above with Jessica White in 2005)\n\n'She just wants to hold my hand again and drag me around everywhere,' says Chrissy's mother who uses the nickname Pepper.\n\n'I think I\u2019m such an open person now because everyone in my family has always been so hush-hush,' says Teigen. 'I love attention and affection. I want to be direct with everyone.'\n\nJohn also touched on his mother Phyllis Stephens, who left the family when John was a young teen, after the sudden death of her own mother at age 58.\n\nWhile John said he was deeply shocked and saddened by the death of his grandmother, his mom Phyllis took it the hardest.\n\n'She was a legitimate drug addict,' John admitted. 'We went years where we barely saw her because we felt a sense of shame.'\n\nJohn excelled academically, and after graduating high school at the age of 16 he enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nHe graduated magna cum laude from the Ivy League University, and soon after got his first taste of the music business when he played piano for Lauryn Hill on her track 'Everything Is Everything.'\n\nAnd it was his college roommate, who is a cousin of Kanye West, who got him his start.\n\n'Kanye, if he\u2019s for you, he\u2019s a very ardent marketer and cheerleader,' said Legend.\n\nHis mother is now off drugs and very much in the EGOT winner's life.\n\n'You look at my mother now, she\u2019s so beautiful and radiant and regal,' said John.\n\n'Knowing what we went through with her as a kid, I was a little bit resentful taking care of her later in life. Like, where were you?' he said.", "description": "'He was kind of known at the time for either being in the closet or a modelizer,' she told the magazine.
