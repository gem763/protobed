Marcus' movement is fantastic and a great cross from James.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"What pleased me the most? The referees' position because he is nowhere near it.\"\n\nDespite being some distance from Rashford when he put the all in the net, Atkinson was right on top of the flashpoint involving Origi.\n\nUnited defender Victor Lindelof appeared to make contact with Origi, who was sent tumbling to the turf.\n\nBut Atkinson allowed play to continue, with United scoring immediately on the break, before he consulted VAR who deemed it not to be a clear and obvious error, and the goal stood.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nReds boss Jurgen Klopp was visibly irate at the decision, and slammed the call after the match.\n\n\"They were better than us and defended well, but in the end they scored a goal that shows all the problems with VAR,\" Klopp fumed.\n\n\"Mr Atkinson let the game run on because that is the protocol of VAR, and VAR shows there was contact and it was a foul.\"\n\nHowever Solskjaer was keen to point to the work of his side in shackling Klopp's side, who only drew level through a late goal from substitute Adam Lallana.\n\n(Image: Offside via Getty Images)\n\n\"The fans were unbelievable and the boys started it,\" Solskjaer said. \"We started on the front foot, pressed them and made them uncomfortable.\n\n\"It was part of the plan to have energy up front to unsettle them.\n\n\"We had a little plan and our fingers crossed that we could everyone back fit. We have lots of centre backs who I trust one vs one. I knew Liverpool could cause problems but we took that risk.\n\n(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)\n\n\"It is down to Ashley [Young] and Aaron [Wan-Bissaka], who were brave to push onto the full-backs. That was a risk and it worked.\"\n\nIn spite of their efforts, the Red Devils remain in the bottom half of the table in 13th, and Solskjaer admitted his team needed to start turning performances into points.\n\n\"We have had some good performances but we need results,\" he added. \"It is good to see the boys are disappointed. We have to kick on and start winning games.\"", "description": "The match official allowed the game to play on despite a flashpoint involving Divock Origi which allowed United to score", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Offside Via Getty Images", "Manchester United Via Getty Imag"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20663577.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Liverpool-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
