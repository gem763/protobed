Gallup notes this is essentially a reversal of the findings of its June poll, when 45 percent said Trump should be impeached and removed, but 53 percent said he shouldn't be. The question was asked in June after the findings of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report were released.\n\nStill, this isn't to say Republicans are getting on board with the inquiry \u2014 the poll found only 6 percent of GOP respondents back impeachment and removal, which is actually down one point from June. Support has risen nine points among independents and eight points among Democrats.\n\nNumerous polls have shown support for impeachment rising in the wake of the House's inquiry being opened, with a recent Fox News poll showing a slim majority of voters, 51 percent, backing it, with support among Republicans rising five points. This prompted Trump to fire off an angry tweet at Fox, writing, \"whoever their pollster is, they suck.\"\n\nGallup's poll was conducted by speaking to a random sample of 1,526 U.S. adults over the phone from Oct. 1-13. The margin of error is 3 percentage points.
