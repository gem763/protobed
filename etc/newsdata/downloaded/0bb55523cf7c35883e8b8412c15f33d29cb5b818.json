She made clear a deal is overwhelmingly unlikely and she thinks the EU has a veto on us leaving the customs union.\"\n\nBritain is due to leave the EU on October 31.\n\nWatch the pound trade live here.\n\nView Markets Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe pound tanked on Tuesday morning, after a senior UK government source claimed that the German chancellor Angela Merkel has told British Prime Minister Boris Johnson that there is now almost no chance of the EU agreeing to a Brexit deal with the UK.\n\nThe pound fell 0.7% against the euro, and 0.4% against the dollar.\n\nSam Coates, deputy political editor at Sky News, was among British reporters citing an anonymous briefing by one of Johnson's aides saying that \"the call with Merkel showed the EU has adopted a new position. She made clear a deal is overwhelmingly unlikely and she thinks the EU has a veto on us leaving the customs union.\"\n\nCoates added that the source said, \"Merkel said that if Germany wanted to leave the EU they can do it no problem but the UK cannot leave without leaving Northern Ireland behind in a customs union and in full alignment forever.\"\n\nThe border between Ireland and Northern Ireland has been a major sticking point in Brexit negotiations, given this would be the only land border between the UK and the EU.\n\nThe source added that the chancellor said Ireland should have a veto on Northern Ireland leaving the customs union.\n\n\"If this represents a new established position, then it means a deal is essentially impossible, not just now, but ever,\" the source added.\n\nFollowing the news, Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, accused the British Prime Minister of playing a \"stupid blame game.\n\n\"@BorisJohnson, what's at stake is not winning some stupid blame game. At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don't want a deal, you don't want an extension, you don't want to revoke, quo vadis?\"\n\nMarkets Insider", "description": "The pound tanked 0.7% against the euro on Tuesday morning, after reports that Boris Johnson's Brexit talks with Angela Merkel hit a dead end.\u00a0 Britis...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d9c64d2880f2645d371fb52-1651/merkel-boris-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
