That compared with a profit of $3.8 billion over the same period a year earlier and $2.8 billion in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nThe results show that the U.K.-based oil and gas company still managed to beat analyst expectations, despite a sharp drop in third-quarter net profits.\n\n\"Overall, it has actually given us a strong set of underlying earnings but, more importantly, strong operating cash \u2014 which has allowed us to stabilize debt this quarter,\" BP CFO Brian Gilvary told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday.\n\nGilvary said that while oil prices were \"pretty finely poised,\" crude futures seemed to be stabilizing somewhere around $60 a barrel.\n\n\"I think that sets us up well given we have got the company back into balance at $50 a barrel about two and a half years ago. So, therefore, we start to generate more surplus cash (and) that surplus cash will help us pay down the debt,\" he added.\n\nInternational benchmark Brent crude traded at $61.32 Tuesday morning, down around 0.4%, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) stood at $55.53, more than 0.5% lower.\n\nBrent crude prices have fallen almost 20% since an April peak, while WTI prices are down more than 15% over the same period.", "description": "Energy giant BP reported a 41% fall in third-quarter net profits on Tuesday, citing lower upstream earnings and weaker oil prices.", "authors": ["Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106045617-1564401718221gettyimages-169952812.jpeg?v=1564401799", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
