Period. https://t.co/dhH8eherOR \u2014 Chris Cillizza (@CillizzaCNN) October 16, 2016\n\nVox journalist Aaron Rupar has left some provably false tweets up, so we guess we have to give him credit for realizing his dunk on President Trump on Labor Day wasn\u2019t quite what he thought it was. It turns out that every president proclaims in Labor Day each year with some boilerplate text. Even Barack Obama did it \u2026 so this tweet he\u2019ll delete, not because it was wrong, but because it zinged Obama too.\n\nDeleted this tweet because Obama\u2019s Labor Day statements included this language too pic.twitter.com/KTXWSTIKiF \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 2, 2019\n\n\u201cDoes he \u2026 does he think he just created Labor Day?\u201d Um, no. Like we said, every president does that every year:\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2, 2019, as Labor Day. I call upon all public officials and people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that honor the contributions and resilience of working Americans. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand nineteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth.\n\n\u201cDeleted tweet making fun of Trump because it turns out our Lord and savior did it too.\u201d pic.twitter.com/AGfLz2tgbT \u2014 Kate Hyde (@KateHydeNY) September 2, 2019\n\nPro tip \u2014> before you pop off on Trump, always check to see if what the Democrat president/administration did in the same situation. It\u2019ll save you a lot of embarrassment. https://t.co/PGoHHS5ECl \u2014 CJ \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@MeedgeKnowsBest) September 2, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s just boilerplace legalese for observing official holidays. Every President for decades has probably just cut & pasted their name into that proclamation. \u2014 #StandWithKashmir (@TexaNerDervish) September 2, 2019\n\nAdmitting you have a problem is step 1. https://t.co/wpG5EZTeTs \u2014 Jeff Godwin (@JeffGodwin) September 2, 2019\n\nYou better be careful or someone might accuse you of being a fair journalist! \ud83d\ude1c \u2014 puppymonkeybaby (@apzanolli) September 2, 2019\n\nIt's standard proclamation language. You're so deranged with hate you can't see past it. \u2014 California Minority (@conserve_a) September 2, 2019\n\nI think that exposes you as a hack. \u2014 who? \u274c (@Jbyrne76) September 2, 2019\n\nOof. How's that \"I don't need to be informed on a topic to offer an opinion\" stance going? \u2014 InTheRightColumn (@TheRightColumn) September 2, 2019\n\nBeen going strong all day.\n\nSorry this is happening to you. \u2014 Chris Tsotsoros (@ctsotsoros) September 2, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "Never try to dunk on Trump before checking to see that Obama didn't do the exact same thing.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/obama-remember-member-me_new.jpg"}
