NO ARCHIVES\n\nA 60-year old woman and 13-year old boy were killed and three wounded in shelling over the Line of Control (LOC), near the informal border with India, on Saturday and Sunday, Pakistan\u2019s foreign ministry said.\n\n\u201cThe ceasefire violations by India are a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation,\u201d said Pakistan\u2019s foreign ministry statement, adding that its spokesman had summoned Indian Deputy High Commissioner Gaurav Ahluwalia to condemn the incident.\n\nA spokesman for India\u2019s foreign ministry said it had no immediate comment on the matter.\n\nIndia and Pakistan both accuse each other of breaching a 2003 ceasefire agreement by shelling and firing over the LOC, killing dozens this year.\n\nIndia has also accused Pakistan of providing support for militants on its territory, a claim Pakistan denies.\n\nThe latest incident comes amid tension between the neighbours that escalated sharply following New Delhi\u2019s move to revoke the autonomy of its portion of Kashmir in August.\n\nPakistan expelled India\u2019s ambassador and suspended bilateral trade soon after and launched an international diplomacy campaign in an attempt to draw global condemnation of India\u2019s treatment of Kashmiris.\n\nPakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan made an impassioned address at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Friday, saying there would be a bloodbath once India lifts a curfew and that any all-out conflict between the nations would reverberate far beyond their borders.\n\nBoth India and Pakistan control Kashmir in part while claiming it in full. India says its revocation of autonomy is an internal matter that will allow its portion of Kashmir to develop economically.\n\nAt home, Khan faced the risk that rising anger in his country\u2019s portion of the disputed region could spiral into a confrontation with India as calls gathered for Kashmiris to storm the LOC.\n\nA spokesman for a Kashmiri separatist group said on Monday that it was planning a large march in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir on October 4, followed by an attempt to cross the LOC, in which tens of thousands were expected to take part.\n\n\u201cIf law enforcement agencies stopped us...we will stage a sit-in there because we are peaceful and unarmed people,\u201d said Rafiq Dar, spokesman for the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF).\n\nPakistan\u2019s military has said it will not allow anyone to cross the LOC.", "description": "Pakistan's government on Monday summoned India's top diplomat in the country over accusations of deadly shelling by India in its portion of the disputed region of Kashmir, as tensions run high between the nuclear-armed rival nations.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435653405&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T1F5", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
