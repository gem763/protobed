(File, AFP)\n\nIndependent candidate Kais Saied and imprisoned media mogul Nabil Karoui have advanced to a run-off after obtaining the most votes in Tunisia's September 15 presidential election.\n\nThe official announcement by the country's electoral commission on Tuesday confirmed constitutional law professor Saied won 18.4% of the vote while Karoui, owner of popular television station Nessma TV, garnered 15.6%. Ennadha's Abdelfattah Mourou came in third with 12.9%.\n\nSaied, a fiercely independent academic, advocates radical decentralisation of power, with local democracy and the ability to remove elected officials from office during their mandates.\n\nKaroui, who built his appeal on high-profile charity campaigns, is under investigation for alleged money laundering and has been in pre-trial detention since August 23.\n\nHe denies all wrongdoing and his supporters attribute his arrest to political manipulation.\n\nThe run-off vote will take place before October 23, the day when the interim leader Mohamed Ennaceur's mandate expires.\n\nTunisia will hold legislative elections on October 6.", "description": "Independent candidate Kais Saied and imprisoned media mogul Nabil Karoui have advanced to a run-off after obtaining the most votes in Tunisia's September 15 presidential election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5037/8ba988eb85c04c45bbc2c29a8382ad62.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
