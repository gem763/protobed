You won't destroy me, and you won't destroy my family.'\n\nJoe Biden penned an op-ed in The Washington Post on Sunday, claiming President Trump is 'frantically pushing flat-out lies' about his family\n\nBiden vowed to maintain his focus on the issues affecting American families as he continues his Democratic campaign.\n\nHe claimed that he would keep attention on his goals of 'getting weapons of war off the streets and ending the epidemic of gun violence; building on Obamacare so that every American has access to quality, affordable health care; and taking on the climate emergency imperiling the planet'.\n\nWhile Biden may want to stick to those talking points, it appears others are still interested in probing him about his family's foreign business dealings.\n\nBiden accused his political foe of 'abusing the power of the presidency' by publicly calling upon Ukraine and China to investigate his son, Hunter's, business dealings in their countries. Joe and Hunter are pictured together in 2009\n\nOn Friday, the politician lashed out at a reporter in response to a question about his potential conflicts of interest in the Ukraine.\n\nAt a Service Employees International Union forum in Los Angeles, Biden was asked about his work overseeing foreign policy for Ukraine as vice president while his son Hunter served on the board of a major Ukrainian company.\n\n'It's not a conflict of interest. There's been no indication of any conflict of interest, in Ukraine or anywhere else. Period,' Biden snapped.\n\nAsked how his son's cushy $50,000-a-month gig didn't at least create the appearance of a conflict of interest, Biden rejoined: 'I'm not going to respond to that. Focus on this man. What he's doing that no president has ever done. No president.'\n\nBiden pauses while speaking at the SEIU forum on Friday. After the event he snapped at a reporter who asked about his potential conflicts of interest\n\nBiden has previously demanded that reporters 'ask the right questions' and accused Trump of trying to 'hijack' the campaign with unfounded assertions that Biden and his son had corrupt dealings in Ukrainian business and politics.\n\nIn late September in Iowa, the former VP scolded a Fox News reporter who asked about his family's ties to Ukraine. 'You should be asking him the question: why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader?' he said.\n\n'This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power. To get on the phone with a foreign leader who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me and imply things \u2026 this is outrageous. You have never seen anything like this from any president.'\n\nBiden renewed his attack on the president with a tweet on Saturday, writing: 'Donald Trump is the definition of corruption.'\n\nIn late September in Iowa, the former VP scolded a Fox News reporter who asked about his family's ties to Ukraine\n\nDevon Archer, far left, golfing in the Hamptons with former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, far right, in 2014. Archer served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings with Hunter\n\nOn Friday, Trump maintained that he had an 'obligation' to request assistance from foreign governments to investigate alleged corruption and asks he made of China and Ukraine were not politically motivated in any way.\n\nTrump insisted that the foreign investigations he's demanding are about Hunter Biden 'pillaging these countries and hurting us,' not his father's bid to become the next President of the United States.\n\nThe scandal around Trump's phone call to the Ukrainian president, asking him to investigate possible Biden family corruption there, has the potential to drag on Biden's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, in addition to driving the House's impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nIn third quarter fundraising reports filed this week with the Federal Election Commission, Biden placed fourth for money raised from donors.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders leads the field, so far, pulling in $25.3 million, with Senator Elizabeth Warren's $24.6 million close behind. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, came in third with $19.1 million.\n\nFrom there, the drop off is steep, with Biden pulling in $15.2 million.\n\nThe latest national polling shows Biden with just a 2.2-point lead on Warren, down from a large double-digit lead on his rivals just months ago.\n\nIn third quarter fundraising reports filed this week with the Federal Election Commission, Biden placed fourth for money raised from donors", "description": "The former Vice President - who has not yet won the Democratic Party's nomination and has been slipping in the polls - made the claim in a fiery op-ed published Sunday in The Washington Post.", "authors": ["Andrew Court", "Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/07/19353230-0-image-a-2_1570341840963.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
