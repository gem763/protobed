For decades, he\u2019s compounded shareholder capital by more than 20% annually. He stays under the radar, but every now and then, reports surface about his biggest bets. Today, he\u2019s betting big on Cheniere Energy, Fox, and ViaSat.\n\nHis biggest position, however, isn\u2019t a stock \u2014 it\u2019s cold, hard cash. Some reports suggest that he could be holding more than 30% of his portfolio in cash. Is Klarman anticipating a sudden market decline? If you want to protect the value of your portfolio, it\u2019s important to understand what\u2019s going on.\n\nStock markets are tidal The tide goes in, the tide goes out \u2014 that\u2019s one of the most popular sayings among stock pickers. It doesn\u2019t matter how hard you try; most investments will be affected by market-wide forces. When markets are rising, it gets harder to find bargains. When markets are plunging, bargains are everywhere, but no one wants to touch them.\n\nThe tidal nature of markets is a huge factor in Klarman\u2019s investing strategy. When markets are expensive and bargains are tough to find, he doesn\u2019t force positions. Instead, he simply lets his cash levels rise. When deals become more plentiful due to stock market declines, he deploys his cash hoard.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that he isn\u2019t timing the market. As another famous investor once said, timing the market is like playing poker with the best. What Klarman is doing is simply buying more stock when he has more conviction and buying less stock when he has less conviction. As long as there are deals to be had, Klarman will continue to buy, no matter what the market overall does. If he can\u2019t find deals, he\u2019ll keep a heavy cash position, even if markets are dropping.\n\nBut deals are out there If Klarman is indeed building a cash hoard, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising. Stock markets, especially in North America, are historically expensive. The dividend yield on the , for example, is close to a 100-year low. If you\u2019re a value investor, it\u2019s been a tough couple of years.\n\nCommenting on the difficulty of uncovering promising investments, Klarman urged investors to get \u201ccreative\u201d in their process. It\u2019s likely time to explore new territory \u2014 scout stocks and industries that aren\u2019t on the radar of most big investment banks or hedge funds. One of those areas may be cannabis.\n\nWhile the cannabis industry enjoyed a surge of optimism last year, many notable names have fallen by 50% or more. Green Organic Dutchman Holdings, for example, is more than 70% off its high. Once a multi-billion-dollar company, the valuation is now below $900 million. The former optimism has quickly devolved into pessimism.\n\nNow is the time to search for deals. Green Organic Dutchman is expected to go from $3 million in quarterly revenues to more than $200 million in annual revenues by next year. This explosive growth is now being priced at a discount. If you\u2019re having trouble finding underpriced stocks like Klarman, take a look at the fallen angels of the pot industry. The cannabis 2.0 revolution could soon have a resurgence of interest.\n\nFool contributor Ryan Vanzo has no position in any stocks mentioned.\n\nThe Motley Fool\u2019s purpose is to help the world invest, better.
