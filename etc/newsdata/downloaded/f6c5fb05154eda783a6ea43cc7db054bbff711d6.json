Shoyu sommelier, Mr Takahashi no longer counts his soy sauces.\n\nHis Shiro Shoyu has the clearest colour; \"from there, the shades become darker because they are aged longer,\" he explains, \"This one has the most powerful aromas. It is tamari.\"\n\nThe ripening, but also the share of soy, salt, and wheat determine the flavour and colour of each shoyu.\n\nThe nuances are striking.\n\nFumiyasu Ookubois is a producer from the Nagano region and shoyu has been part of the family history for 133-years.\n\n\"My father often said, \"you have to do the right thing and wait \": one year for the taste, two years for the aroma and three years for the colour.

They are bathed in spring water and aged for a long time.\n\nThree years later, the nectar is manually filtered, a rare skill that is much-respected.\n\n\"Before, I thought exporting was only for big companies, but times have changed,\" says Jouzouten Ookubo CEO, Fumiyasu Ookubo.\n\n\"Traditional shoyu, prepared using ancestral methods, is very popular. That's why we manage to sell it abroad.\"", "description": "In Japan, soy sauce is an art made with three elements:  raw materials, techniques and fermentation time to create a unique product.", "authors": ["Katy Dartford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/17/22/58/1000x563_cmsv2_c478da47-56fb-563f-bc1e-6b9a26af6917-4172258.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
