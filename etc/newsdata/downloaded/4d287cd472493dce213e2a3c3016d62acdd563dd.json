Project Streedhan asks women to give iron levels in their bodies an equal importance as the precious metal. The data presented by the campaign (from the government\u2019s National Family Health Survey, 2016) shows that one out of every two women in the country is anaemic, its main cause being deficiency of iron. The condition leads to weakness and exhaustion. It also states that India ranks the highest in world for prevalence of anaemia among its women, and over 50 per cent of those in urban India are also anaemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe campaign uses the hashtag #InvestInIron to urge women to eat foods rich in iron. The tagline of the video reads \u2018My iron is my real wealth\u2019. Project Streedhan shared a video on social media, and it has garnered a lot of positive response, apart from vocal support by celebrities including actor Vidya Balan. She took to Instagram to share a picture with her favourite iron-rich food\u2014dates.\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Vidya Balan (@balanvidya) on Oct 19, 2019 at 4:30am PDT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "One out of two women in India is anemic, and Project Streedhan is urging women to invest in iron this festive season", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/oct/thstreedhan1571900266.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
