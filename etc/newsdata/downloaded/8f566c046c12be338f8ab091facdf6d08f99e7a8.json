REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz\n\nUNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday expressed concerns about the Middle East situation and urged Iran to take actions \u201cgrounded in the wisdom derived from its rich history\u201d.\n\nIn a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Abe called the Sept. 15 attacks on Saudi oil facilities \u201can extremely contemptible crime that holds the international economic order hostage\u201d.\n\nHe did not, however, specify who Japan thought was behind the attacks, which Riyadh, Washington and the leading EU powers have blamed on Iran. Japan has traditionally had friendly ties with Iran and Abe has been trying to ease the tensions between Tehran and Tokyo\u2019s closest ally, Washington.\n\n\u201cIt is my own unchanging role to call on Iran as a major power to take actions that are grounded in the wisdom derived from its rich history,\u201d Abe said, noting that Japan shared concerns regarding the Middle East situation.\n\nAbe met Iranian President Hassan Rouhani earlier in the day.\n\nAbe also said he supported U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s approach to North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe approach by which the two leaders talk candidly with each other and try to work out the issues at hand while seeing a bright future ahead has changed the dynamics surrounding North Korea,\u201d he said. He repeated that he wants to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \u201cwithout attaching any conditions\u201d.", "description": "Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday expressed concerns about the Middle East situation and urged Iran to take actions \"grounded in the wisdom derived from its rich history\".", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433575118&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O048", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
