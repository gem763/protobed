They seem to be the shaded part of the Venn diagram no matter which way you look at it, from Britain\u2019s point of view or from the Republic\u2019s point of view.\n\nSiobhan has been vocal in her support for abortion reform in Northern Ireland (Picture: NIKLAS HALLE\u2019N/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMs Foster wants Stormont to sit before Monday to stop abortion reform (Picture: Danny Lawson/PA Wire)\n\n\u2018What\u2019s happening at the moment is, for me, quite simplistically \u2013 if people tell you who you are the first time, believe them. The DUP have repeatedly and consistently throughout their existence been a party and philosophy of bigotry, exclusion and ignorance, frankly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcSweeney continued: \u2018I feel distraught for the people of Northern Ireland because not only have they been abandoned by Britain, they have been held hostage by the DUP, who have shown their colours. They\u2019re willing to be sold. They are what they claim they\u2019re not. They\u2019re cheap and yet they\u2019re also expensive \u2013 they can be bought.\u2019\n\nLeader of the DUP Arlene Foster has called for Stormont to sit before Monday, as same-sex marriage and abortion \u2013 which are currently illegal in NI \u2013 laws will change unless devolution is restored by 21 October.\n\nThe DUP has publicly opposed Westminster legislating on abortion reform.\n\nSiobhan says that the Republic of Ireland have their own struggles (Picture: David M. Benett/Dave Benett/WireImage)\n\nToday, Ms Foster announced that the party would not be backing Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans, saying: \u2018As things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues, and there is a lack of clarity on VAT.\n\n\u2018We will continue to work with the Government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.\u2019\n\nSiobh\u00e1n also spoke of the struggles in the Republic of Ireland, citing British people applying for Irish passports in the wake of Brexit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u2018In the Republic, we\u2019re struggling \u2013 absolutely we\u2019re struggling. We have so many people coming from the United Kingdom who want Irish passports, and yet we have our own problem in the Republic where we\u2019re not giving passports to the people who are actually Irish, as opposed to people who have an Irish history or legacy or whatever, who haven\u2019t been brought up there.\u2019\n\nThe actress said she was \u2018proud\u2019 to be at the Pink News Awards, saying: \u2018It is a place where we can celebrate achievements that have been made in the most vulnerable parts of our society and the most neglected of our society. When it comes to Northern Ireland, the DUP perpetuate neglect.\u2019\n\nHeld at Church House in Westminster, the annual awards saw speeches from Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, outgoing speaker John Bercow, Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary Dawn Butler, MP Diane Abbott, Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer, MP Penny Mordaunt and Conservative Chairman James Cleverly.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
