However, he lost his majority government and will lead a minority in Parliament instead.\n\nLiberals won 157 seats in the Canadian Parliament with 33 percent of the vote share or 5.62 million votes to Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservative Party\u2019s 121 seats with 5.88 million votes or a 34.5 percent share.\n\nTrudeau, in Montreal, Que., told his supporters and staff Tuesday that this victory was because of them.\n\n\u201cYou did it, my friends. Congratulations,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom coast to coast to coast tonight, Canadians rejected division and negativity. They rejected cuts and austerity and they voted in favor of a progressive agenda and strong action on climate change.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump was quick to congratulate Trudeau on Twitter for his \u201cwonderful and hard-fought victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cCanada is well served,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI look forward to working with you toward the betterment of both of our countries!\u201d\n\nThe source of Trudeau\u2019s drop this election could be that his image as the face of a liberal Canada that embraces all was tarnished shortly after the election campaign began in September when the first of three instances of the son of the former late Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau in brownface surfaced.\n\n\u201cThis is something I shouldn\u2019t have done many years ago,\u201d he said following the revelation of the picture of him dressed in brownface and a turban published in a 2000-2001 yearbook for a school he worked for at the time. \u201cI take responsibility for my decision to do that. I didn\u2019t think it was racist at the time. I now realize it was.\u201d\n\nCandidates attacked Trudeau for it including Scheer who has repeatedly stated he won\u2019t walk in Toronto\u2019s LGBT Pride Parade and who has said he\u2019d stand by Conservative candidates who apologize for past discriminatory remarks.\n\nScheer, 40, has also faced scandal during this campaign, as the right-wing candidate came under scrutiny for being a dual citizen holding a U.S. passport.\n\nWhen questioned during the campaign why he never mentioned his U.S. citizenship, he replied: \u201cNo one\u2019s ever asked me before about it.\u201d\n\nThough he has since said he will renounce the citizenship he received through his U.S.-born father.\n\nHowever, the Conservatives made substantial gains from 2015, earning some 20 seats more than last time around.\n\nIn his concession speech Tuesday, Scheer said the Conservative Party has put Trudeau and his Liberal Party \u201con notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile tonight\u2019s result isn\u2019t what we wanted, I am also incredibly proud \u2014 proud of our team, proud of our campaign and proud of the bigger and stronger Conservative team that we will send to Ottawa,\u201d he said. \u201cTonight, Conservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice, and Mr. Trudeau, when you\u2019re government falls, Conservatives will be ready and we will win.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the left-wing NDP, led by Singh, who was seeking to build off 2015\u2019s 44 seats, took a substantial hit, dropping by nearly half.\n\n\u201cThank you, Canada,\u201d Singh, who won his seat in British Columbia\u2019s Burnaby South riding, said early Tuesday on Twitter. \u201cWhat a night \u2014 and what an unforgettable journey this campaign has been. With our new NDP caucus in Ottawa, I\u2019m incredibly excited to continue our critical work to achieve the priorities that we\u2019ve heard from people across this country.\u201d\n\nAnd the minor though strong conservative Quebec party, the Bloc Quebecois, jumped by more than 20 seats from the 10 they garnered in the last election.\n\nElizabeth May\u2019s Green Party won three seats, an increase of one from the election prior.", "description": "(UPI) -- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party won enough seats Monday night to secure him a second four-year term.", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177523340-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
