I chose to laugh | CBC News", "language": "en", "text": "It's moving day, and my family is coming back home.\n\nIt's been a year since a tornado made this place \"unlivable.\" I use quotes because it was technically livable \u2013 if you don't mind sharing a room with a family of squirrels.\n\nGot a story to share? Send a pitch for our \"Point of View\" section.\n\nOn Sept. 21, 2018, I got a tornado warning on my phone. I thought, \"Ottawa doesn't get tornadoes! Surely the weather guy is mistaken.\"\n\nI also ignored the second and third warnings and continued to sit in the living room with the kids, eating a pizza.\n\nSuddenly, my neighbour's pool lands in our yard.\n\nRory Gardiner's house and car were hit by trees after a tornado swept through his Arlington Woods neighbourhood a year ago. 'I asked for a new pine-scented air freshener for the Jeep,' Gardiner says. 'But this isn't what I had in mind.' (Rory Gardiner)\n\nThat's when panic set in. I grabbed my favourite kid and we all headed to the basement.\n\nThe roof flies off, the kids' swing set disappears \u2014 but they don't care. They're excited about their new pool. Finders keepers.\n\nThe whole thing lasted about 20 seconds. When we finally popped our heads up, we were surprised at how bright it was.\n\nThat's because for the first time in decades, there were no trees blocking the sunlight. Part of the allure of moving to the Arlington Woods neighbourhood was the fact that I'd never have to spend a dime on window shades.\n\nMaybe we should rename the neighborhood \"Arlington Stumps.\"\n\nRory Gardiner remembers when hot tubs used to be relaxing. (Rory Gardiner)\n\nTears won't fix things\n\nThat evening, we packed our bags and headed to my parents' place. After a restless night, we went back to have a fresh look at the damage.\n\nThere was no road access, as both trees and emergency crews covered the streets. Walking through our neighborhood, we felt it was nearly unrecognizable.\n\nSo many emotions raced through me. My body didn't quite know how to express them, so I just laughed. Tears won't take the refrigerator off my Jeep, after all. That's when I took out my phone and started filming the damage with some \"comedic\" commentary.\n\nI put it on YouTube and shared it with a few neighbours. Little did I know, it would get passed around, and in a few days would hit over 10,000 views.\n\nIn his YouTube video, Rory Gardiner joked his Arlington Woods home had more of an 'outside feel' after the tornadoes of Sept 2018. (Rory Gardiner)\n\nResiliency is a word that often comes up when people describe my family's situation. People ask, \"How were you able to find humour in such a tragic circumstance?\"\n\nAt the time, I didn't know.\n\nI was under the assumption that something was wrong with me, and I'd eventually need expensive therapy.\n\nThen I realized I had a choice. I could let the stress of the tornado take over my emotional wellbeing, or I could continue channeling it into something positive.\n\nRory Gardiner turned his experience into a play called Tornado Troubles that he performed this summer at the Ottawa Fringe Festival. (Sandra Abma/CBC)\n\nCoping mechanism\n\nI've been an entertainer for almost 20 years. As a songwriter and standup comedian, anything good or bad that's ever happened in my life got put into a song or turned into a joke.\n\nIt's unknowingly how I've dealt with adversity my entire adult life. It took surviving a natural disaster for me to realize to what extent creativity could be my coping mechanism.\n\nAnd it's how I'll survive moving back home again to a neighbourhood that doesn't look the same.\n\nGardiner also used the tornado strike as inspiration for a TedX talk on resilience. ( Liz Carlile)\n\nTricking my brain\n\nDon't get me wrong: it's great to be back. But it's also strange looking at a vacant lot across the street where there used to be a house.\n\nWhen the wind picks up, or there's a thunderstorm, we need to put noise-cancelling headphones on my seven-year-old. I don't know how long it takes to overcome PTSD in kids, but we're working on it.\n\nI feel the need to put on a brave face for them. But I also find that acting resilient for my children tricks my brain into thinking I'm really who I'm pretending to be \u2014 another \"self-discovered\" coping mechanism I wish they'd taught us in school.\n\nUntil the tornado, the only adversity I'd had to overcome was the time a lady stole my bike in spin class. This experience has taught me so much about myself, about human nature, and we've all become stronger as a result.\n\nRory Gardiner says one year later, his neighbourhood is much brighter, and jokes it could be renamed \"Arlington Stumps.\" (Rory Gardiner)\n\nThe neighborhood will never be the same, but we're excited to be a part of the next chapter of Arlington Woods/Stumps.\n\nI also want to apologize to the weather guy. Next time I see a severe weather alert, I'll take it seriously.\n\nRory Gardiner is an Ottawa musician, comedian and speaker who's turned his tornado experiences into a TEDx talk on resilience called \"Finding the Funny when Disaster Strikes.\"", "description": "One year ago, a tornado gave Rory Gardiner's Arlington Woods house a decidedly 'outside feel.'
