Manila and Jakarta were also well in positive territory.\n\nSTERLING EXTENDS GAINS\n\nAdding to the positive vibe were comments from China's cabinet flagging a cut in the amount of cash banks must keep in reserve, a move aimed at releasing more cash into the stuttering economy.\n\n\"A full cut to banks' reserve ratio is needed to make sure of effective financial support to economic growth, as the global economy slows and domestic consumption and investment face headwinds,\" said Wen Bin, at China Minsheng Banking Corp.\n\nOn currency markets, high-yielding, riskier assets were up across the board against the dollar, led by the Australian dollar and South Korean won.\n\nThe Chinese yuan, which hit 11-year lows earlier in the week, was also well up.\n\nThe sterling continued its recovery, having slumped to its weakest level since 1985 except for a 2016 \"flash crash\".\n\nThe unit has enjoyed buying as lawmakers in Westminster push through legislation to avert crashing out of the EU on October 31, delivering an embarrassing blow to new Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nOn Wednesday, they also blocked his attempt to call a general election until their bill had become law. Economists have warned that a no-deal Brexit could hammer the British economy.\n\nThe euro was also supported by developments in Italy, where the new coalition will be sworn in Thursday, drawing a line under a months-long crisis sparked by the far right.\n\nOil prices built on Wednesday's gains of more than four percent for both contracts, which came in response to the positive stories, as well as fresh US sanctions on Iran and Russia's promise to stick to a deal with Opec to cut output.\n\nHowever, while the mood on trading floors is positive, Stephen Innes, Asia-Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader, sounded a note of caution.\n\n\"While a drop in geopolitical risk premium comes as a welcome relief, with the omnipresent trade war clouds looming ominously over the market... the air remains thick with caution.\"\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Stocks - [HONG KONG] Asian equities and currencies rallied on Thursday, building on the previous day's advance as investors were cheered by a number of positive developments on trade, Hong Kong and Europe. .
