But the political war in Washington changes the outlook for some key policy issues that investors should pay close attention to.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans don\u2019t cooperate very much these days, but the House\u2019s effort to impeach Trump will raise the usual standoff to cold war levels. \u201cThe latest impeachment imbroglio is a negative catalyst for markets,\u201d Beacon Research advised clients on Sept. 25. \u201cWhile political gridlock is often good for markets by reducing the risk of government interference, dysfunctional paralysis of government is not because it increases uncertainty over the government\u2019s ability to handle a crisis.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s trade deal with Canada and Mexico\u2014the USMCA\u2014could be the first casualty of impeachment. Trump finalized a deal last year to replace the old North American Free Trade Agreement, but Congress must ratify it before it goes into effect. And that now seems unlikely. \u201cBipartisan action on \u2026 the passage of the USMCA (the new NAFTA) is dead until after the 2020 election,\u201d writes Ed Mills of Raymond James.\n\nThe next question is whether Trump withdraws the United States from NAFTA, as he has threatened to do, or remains in the old NAFTA. Watch out below. \u201cWe think that the political one-upmanship between President Trump and Speaker Pelosi could culminate in a series of decisions that ultimately leave the United States without any North American free trade agreement,\u201d writes Stefanie Miller of Sandhill Strategies.\n\nThis could be tumultuous. Tariffs or other new barriers to trade among the three nations could damage the auto industry, which dominates trade between the United States and Mexico. U.S. farmers could be hurt, too, since much American produce goes to Mexico. It would be self-defeating for Trump to blow up NAFTA and harm the U.S. economy as he\u2019s vying for reelection. As the whole world knows, however, Trump can be contrary and unpredictable.\n\nNegotiations with China\n\nImpeachment will affect Trump\u2019s trade negotiations with China as well. On one hand, Trump will become more desperate for some kind of deal he can point to as a win, while also eliminating the economic harm the trade war is causing. Some analysts think that could lead to a mini-deal that doesn\u2019t accomplish much but deescalates the situation, which would cheer markets.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is surrounded by reporters as she arrives to meet with her caucus the morning after declaring she will launch a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2019.

The battle with Democrats weakens Trump\u2019s hand with China, because he\u2019s fighting a rear-guard action on his home turf while also taking on China. Trump\u2019s reelection odds are already weak, given his low approval ratings, so China might just wait for the election. And we\u2019ve already seen that a spurned Trump can ratchet up the trade war without notice. It\u2019s hard to predict whether impeachment will intensify or ease the trade war with China. But it probably moves one way or the other instead of drifting along in its current state.\n\nLegislative action\n\nPolitical combat between Democrats and Republicans probably raises the odds of a government shutdown later this year, as spending bills expire. President Trump may speed up his plan to lower prescription drug prices, to distract from negative news on impeachment. That plan would only be an administrative action, though, making it subject to legal and logistical challenges, like other Trump orders.\n\nThe biggest unknown is whether impeachment will hurt or help Trump, which carries implications for who the next president is likely to be. The Republican impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998 boosted his approval ratings into the 60-percent range, because Americans thought it was a politically motivated, well, witch hunt. Trump undoubtedly hopes impeachment does the same for him. A lot may come down to how he responds.", "description": "The Democrats' impeachment inquiry jeopardizes trade deals and intensifies political combat in Washington.", "authors": ["Rick Newman", "Senior Columnist"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JIiDrLHAiMptrTJPM2Jwfg--~B/aD0xOTI2O3c9Mjg4OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/d3df9f00-dfa0-11e9-b3fd-51e372982e7d", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
