REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nThe support of Foster\u2019s party, which is allied with Johnson\u2019s governing Conservatives, is seen as key to getting any Brexit deal passed by parliament, but it has balked at Northern Ireland being treated differently from the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe so-called Northern Irish backstop, an insurance policy to prevent the return of a hard border between the British province and EU member Ireland after Brexit, has been the main stumbling block to reaching an agreement with Brussels.\n\nFoster said she was an optimist and was hopeful that Johnson could negotiate a new deal with the EU, something she said would protect Northern Irish trade, particularly in agricultural products.\n\n\u201cNo one wants to have huge infrastructure at the border ... There has to be a willingness to be flexible, to be creative, while recognising the constitutional position of Northern Ireland,\u201d Foster told an event at the Conservative Party\u2019s annual conference.\n\n\u201cIn relation to customs ... we are very, very clear - we have to leave on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom. We cannot have an internal customs border within the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nBritish officials have said there has been some progress in talks with the EU on the backstop and will present formal proposals later this week. But negotiators in Brussels question whether London has \u201can equally effective and operational alternative to our safety net\u201d.\n\nAsked whether the DUP could accept regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and Britain beyond agricultural goods or accept some kind of special status that would put Northern Ireland in a customs territory with both the United Kingdom and the EU, Foster replied: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think what some people don\u2019t understand about the Democratic Unionist Party is that when we have set out our position, that is our position,\u201d said Foster.\n\n\u201cHow can we possibly be in the EU customs union and also be in the UK?\u201d", "description": "Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said on Sunday she supported Prime Minister Boris Johnson, but could not accept leaving the EU on different terms to the rest of the country.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435229771&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0LH", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
