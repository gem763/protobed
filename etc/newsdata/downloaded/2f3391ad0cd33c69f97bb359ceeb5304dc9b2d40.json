Several lawyers have slammed the app for invading the privacy of the users, calling for the boycott of the app.\n\nMomo has since deleted the controversial clause and issued an apology, stressing the app would not store the biometric information of users nor would it excessively collect user information.\n\nSee also: 160,000 resumes on Chinese recruitment site Zhilian allegedly exposed and leaked\n\nIn its updated app clause, Zao says that the transferring of data to third parties would require authorisation from users.\n\nStill, WeChat, the popular Chinese messaging app that has more than 1 billion active users, has banned the circulation of Zao video clips on its platforms.\n\nResponding to reports that China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has requested rectification of the app on September 4, Momo said it has been actively working with authorities to strictly strengthen its content management and improve various management mechanisms to ensure the safety of personal information and data security of users.\n\nAs facial payment has been enabled across several platforms including Alipay, the mobile payment of Alibaba Group, some users also worry that the leak of their facial images and the simulated video clips could result in potential financial losses.\n\nAnt Financial, which owns Alipay, nevertheless said the \"deepfake\" is impossible to fraud its facial payment technology as it adopts 3D face recognition technology. The company also added that it 3D face recognition technology combines software and hardware to determine whether the facial information is generated by a photo, video, or software simulation.\n\nRelated coverage\n\nTencent's messaging app WeChat now available for cars\n\nDrivers will be able to operate the in-car app through voice commands or steering wheel buttons to check unread messages, send new messages, as well as make WeChat calls.\n\nTwitter bans 936 accounts managed by the Chinese state, aimed at Hong Kong protests\n\nTwitter will also stop accepting ads paid for by state-run news agencies.\n\nChinese e-commerce app Xiaohongshu unavailable for download on Android: Report\n\nXiaohongshu, whose monthly active userbase exceeds 85 million globally, might be removed for falsifying users' sharing notes to boost product sales, according to Chinese state media.\n\nCitizen Lab: WeChat's real-time censorship system uses hash indexes to filter content\n\nThe filtering systems also censor content that are not critical of the Chinese government\n\nChina is the biggest obstacle to US AI advancement, half of CEOs say (TechRepublic)\n\nA lack of talent and employee trust are some of the largest barriers to artificial intelligence adoption in US businesses, according to an EY report", "description": "A clause in the Zao app's user agreement allowed developers to retain images of users and sell them to third parties.", "authors": ["Cyrus Lee"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/10/23/3e2b8d6e-9548-4a7f-bc89-da0c15d439f7/thumbnail/770x578/5f45e592f2dde4ad498621f66f9f891f/istock-872707982.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
