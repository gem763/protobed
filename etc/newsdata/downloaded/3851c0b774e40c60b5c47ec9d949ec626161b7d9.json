Call up Sport Plus mode, hold the brake with your left foot, floor the accelerator with your right. Release the brake and try to keep your neck steady. There's no pre-heating the battery, no fussing with traction control settings, nothing.\n\nAnd no histrionics. Just 750 hp and 774 lb-ft of torque turned into forward motion without a hint of wheelspin and minimal noise. There's a good chance the loudest thing in the car will be the passengers as you rip to 60 mph quicker than a 911 Turbo S.\n\nYou probably know that this is Porsche's first electric car, built on a brand-new platform that'll soon underpin a high-riding wagon, the Taycan Cross Turismo, and a swoopy Audi sedan, the E-Tron GT. It's a big deal, breaking all sorts of new ground for Porsche. It's meant to reduce the automaker's fleet fuel consumption and C02 emissions; it's meant to compete with the Tesla Model S; it's meant to start Porsche's gradual transition away from internal-combustion. And at the end of the day, it has to live up to the Porsche name.\n\nPhoto credit: Porsche More\n\nOur first chance to sample the Taycan came as part of a Scandinavian road trip put on by Porsche to demonstrate the new EV's usability. The Turbo and Turbo S are all-wheel drive, with a permanent magnet synchronous motor powering each axle. (An entry-level rear-drive Taycan is likely to arrive soon.) On the top-spec Turbo S, those motors combine to make 626 horsepower in normal driving, rising to 750 for 2.5 seconds when launch control is activated. The rear motor drives a trick two-speed transmission with a low-ratio first gear. In Sport and Sport Plus modes, the car uses first gear from zero to around 50 mph for quicker acceleration. In all other modes, the car stays in second.\n\nPhoto credit: Porsche More\n\nTesla showed the world just how violently quick an electric car can be. The Taycan is capable of equal violence: The Turbo S hits 60 mph in 2.6 seconds, and runs the quarter-mile in 10.8.\n\nBut the Tesla takes some coaxing to get there. Ludicrous Mode will only engage after the battery reaches the right temperature\u2014and depending on ambient conditions, that might take awhile. Back-to-back launches will run the Model S out of breath, acceleration waning as battery temps rise. The Taycan can hit its marks over and over, no warm-up or cool-down required. A lot of work went into that. The Porsche's 800-volt architecture runs lower current, allowing engineers to use smaller-gauge wiring, reducing temperatures.", "description": "Porsche's first electric car is wickedly quick.
