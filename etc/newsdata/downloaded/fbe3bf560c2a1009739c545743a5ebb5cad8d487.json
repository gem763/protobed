The headline index fell 0.4%, against expectations for a decline of 0.2% (both not seasonally adjusted). That still left the year-over-year pace at 1.9% since a similar pattern occurred last year. Furthermore, the Bank of Canada\u2019s three core measures are still averaging a hair above 2%, with the core-common actually accelerating a tick to 1.9%. Overall, no significant implications for the Bank of Canada which we expect to remain on hold later this month.\u201d\n\nSIMON HARVEY, FX MARKET ANALYST FOR MONEX EUROPE AND MONEX CANADA\n\n\u201cThe same as last month, this all looks like it\u2019s driven by the energy sector. You strip out the gasoline change and headline inflation excluding gasoline is averaging at 2.4%. This is perfect for the Bank of Canada, it doesn\u2019t really show any need for them to change tack with their current stance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis reduces the probability of a Bank of Canada rate cut to become infinitesimal at the end of the month. And I think we can pretty much disregard a Bank of Canada rate cut for this year.\u201d\n\nNATHAN JANZEN, SENIOR ECONOMIST, ROYAL BANK OF CANADA\n\n\u201cThe headline CPI inflation increase I think was a little softer than expected, but it looks like there were some big moves in some of the more noisy sub-components, so air fares declined pretty sharply month over month more than they did a year ago. When you strip out some of the volatility, the Bank of Canada\u2019s core measures actually moved up slightly. So I think in terms of the underlying inflation backdrop this doesn\u2019t really change anything, it still looks like underlying inflation trends are running right around the 2% rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think (this changes anything for the Bank of Canada) because those core measures are still pretty firmly around 2%, they and everyone else knows that the headline CPI numbers can be volatile month over month.\u201d", "description": "Canada's annual inflation rate in September held steady at 1.9%, as gasoline prices continued to fall, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
