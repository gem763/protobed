Topanga\u2019s feminism on \u201cBoy Meets World\u201d was often a punch line. On \u201cSaved by the Bell,\u201d Jessie Spano was relentlessly mocked for calling out Slater\u2019s chauvinism. It was a running gag for the entire series.\n\nThere was always reverence for \u201creal\u201d activists, of course \u2014 the heroes of the civil rights movement, the suffragists, Cesar Chavez, Harvey Milk \u2014 people who had lived and died and won great battles before we were born. But social justice activism as a continuum, a mantle to take up, a moral obligation (particularly for those of us born into comfort and power) was harder to see. Contemporary activists were human hacky sacks with suspect motives or imperfect methods or any other number of manufactured excuses as to why they weren\u2019t legitimate, weren\u2019t the same as our parents marching to end segregation on the same streets a couple of decades before.\n\nThis artificial divide between past and present is a tactic I recognize now. The modern right loves to quote the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a \u201creal\u201d activist, while deriding Black Lives Matter. Conservatives claim to support social justice in the abstract but hate \u201csocial justice warriors.\u201d They\u2019re all for freedom and equality, they say, but sneer at the mechanisms that might actually help get us there as bleeding-heart pandering to the dreaded \u201cpolitically correct.\u201d\n\nI did not go to the W.T.O. protest partly because my mom told me I couldn\u2019t and partly because I didn\u2019t understand it, but primarily because I\u2019d been taught that when ordinary people, especially young people, try to do activism, they look stupid.\n\nBut things are different now.\n\nOne recent afternoon, my stepdaughter, who is neither mediocre nor white, paused while passing through the living room and asked, \u201cAre you guys busy tomorrow night?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably,\u201d my husband said. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you know how I\u2019m in the Art of Resistance and Resilience Club? We\u2019re finally unveiling our Black Panthers mural. Bobby Seale is going to be there, and I\u2019m giving a speech. Well, actually, it\u2019s more of a poem. You guys can come if you want to.\u201d Shrug, bye.\n\nWe canceled our plans.\n\nThe mural is spectacular, at the intersection of the two major roads that carry drivers from fully gentrified central Seattle to quickly gentrifying south Seattle. Images of Black Panthers distributing food and registering black voters stretch 40 feet along the sidewalk outside the high school, which is 93 percent kids of color.", "description": "How \u201990s pop culture convinced a generation of would-be earnest activists that caring was uncool.", "authors": ["Lindy West"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/opinion/sunday/27west/27west-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
