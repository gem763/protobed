One of the letters is from the actor herself, another from her husband, Oscar-winning actor William H. Macy, and a particularly juicy one comes from Huffman\u2019s former \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d co-star and friend, Eva Longoria.\n\nAxelle/Bauer-Griffin via Getty Images Felicity Huffman (right) attends the ceremony that honored Eva Longoria with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in April 2018.\n\nLongoria wrote that when she began on the hit ABC show that premiered in 2004, she was \u201cscared\u201d because she was \u201cnew to the business\u201d and that Huffman immediately befriended her. She also said that when an unnamed \u201cHousewives\u201d co-star started to bully her, Huffman stood up for her.\n\n\u201cI dreaded the days I had to work with that person because it was pure torture,\u201d Longoria said. \u201cUntil one day, Felicity told the bully \u2018enough\u2019 and it all stopped. Felicity could feel that I was riddled with anxiety even though I never complained or mentioned the abuse to anyone.\u201d\n\nShe also described an incident that happened a few years later, when Huffman decided to spearhead a salary negotiation in which four co-stars \u2015 the others were Teri Hatcher and Marcia Cross \u2015 would receive equal pay. Longoria wrote:\n\n\u201cThis did not go over too well with the others. But Felicity stood up for me, saying it was fair because the success of the show depended on all of us, not one of us. This fight lasted weeks, but Felicity held strong and convinced everyone this was the right thing to do. And thanks to her, I was bumped up to favored nations. It wasn\u2019t about the money for me, it was the fact that I was seen as an equal, which is how Felicity had always seen me.\u201d\n\nLongoria also said in her letter that she wanted to use her fame to help highlight charities she supported, and when she needed help, her \u201cHousewives\u201d co-stars were \u201cusually too busy to help, except Felicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many times she was the only one who would physically show up to help me with the kids with cancer, or children with special needs,\u201d Longoria wrote.\n\nAnother letter from Huffman\u2019s sentencing memorandum is from Marc Cherry, the creator of \u201cDesperate Housewives.\u201d\n\nCherry wrote that Huffman was typically on the receiving end of a \u201cproblematic\u201d co-star\u2019s wrath whom Cherry describes as a \u201cbig star with some big behavioral problems.\u201d\n\nYet despite it all, Huffman always took the higher road, he said.\n\nAlberto E. Rodriguez via Getty Images Longoria, Marc Cherry and Huffman at Longoria\u2019s Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony.\n\n\u201cEveryone tried their darndest to get along with this woman over the course of the show. It was impossible. And things went from bad to worse,\u201d Cherry wrote. \u201cFelicity still insisted on saying \u2018good morning\u2019 to this actress, even though she knew she wouldn\u2019t get a response. I found out about this and asked Felicity about it. She smiled and said, \u2018just because that woman\u2019s determined to be rude, doesn\u2019t mean she can keep me from being polite.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear which co-star Longoria and Cherry are referring to in their letters. But if an interview Longoria did on Jimmy Fallon last year is any indication, one could make an educated assumption.\n\nIn her interview, Longoria said that among her former co-stars \u201c99% of us are still friends.\u201d\n\nShe also mentioned that Cross and Huffman came to her ceremony when she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.", "description": "Longoria spills the tea on some behind-the-scenes drama while defending Huffman\u2019s character.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d76c8aa240000d32677c8f8.jpeg?cache=ch5xhirsov&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
