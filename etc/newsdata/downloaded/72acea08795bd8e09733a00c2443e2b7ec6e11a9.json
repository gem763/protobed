Cows try 'Floating Farm' in Rotterdam", "language": "en", "text": "ROTTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch businesswoman Minke van Wingerden looks on proudly as one of her 32 brown-and-white cows makes a pit stop at an automated milking station on an unusual farm: a platform located on one of the waterways in Rotterdam port.\n\nVan Wingerden is one of the developers of the \u201cFloating Farm\u201d, testing whether small-scale, sustainable dairy farming is feasible in the heart of one of the world\u2019s most urban, industrial areas - far away from rolling green fields of a traditional agribusiness.\n\n\u201cThis idea started in 2012, my partner Peter he was involved in a project in New York and then Hurricane Sandy hit New York very badly, so it was flooded and after two days there was no fresh food on the shelves anymore because the logistic hub was also flooded,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo then we realised \u2018why not produce fresh food healthy food on the water close to the city?\u2019, and that\u2019s where the idea came up.\u201d\n\nThe cows, seemingly unperturbed by their futuristic setting on the fringe of Europe\u2019s largest and busiest port, can rest on the upper level of the structure or head to a feeding station for a mix of hay, grass clippings and beer byproducts.\n\nMilk and manure processing facilities are located on the lower deck, as well as the visitors\u2019 entrance and store. A quayside pasture gives the animals the chance to be on dry land.\n\nThe structure\u2019s roof is used to collect rainwater. Power for the farm comes from a solar panel array floating nearby.\n\n\u201cThe amount of arable land is decreasing and the world population is growing so how can we produce enough healthy food in the future?,\u201d Van Wingerden said. \u201cSeventy percent of the world is water so why not use the water to produce fresh healthy food near to the consumers?\u201d\n\nClose to the town of Schiedam, the farm is located in one channel of the \u201cMerwehaven\u201d, a harbour within the sprawling 105 square kilometre port, which handles containers ships from all over the world.\n\nThe whole farm site is kitted out with the latest in dairy tech such as an automated feeding system, manure-scooping robots, self-serve cleaning stations, and the smartphone app on-site farmer Albert Boersen uses to monitor his cows.\n\n\u201cWe try to be as circular as can be and it\u2019s still a (matter of) research how we can find out more circles in this farm,\u201d Van Wingerden says.\n\nAs part of its aim to be self-sustainable, the farm already has a manure separator used to separate dry material from urine, with the dry part used as bedding for the cows and the urine turned into an organic fertiliser.\n\nIt sells some bottles of raw milk on-site to visitors, while the rest is pasteurised and turned into milk or yoghurt. It is sold to customers who live nearby via a online grocer, Picnic, known for its small, electric delivery vans.", "description": "Dutch businesswoman Minke van Wingerden looks on proudly as one of her 32 brown-and-white cows makes a pit stop at an automated milking station on an unusual farm: a platform located on one of the waterways in Rotterdam port.", "authors": ["Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
