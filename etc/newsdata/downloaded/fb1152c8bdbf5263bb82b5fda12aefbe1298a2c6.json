UPDATE 1-Oil prices on ebb tide as gloom gathers over global economy\n\n* Brent, WTI benchmarks fell more than 5% last week\n\n* Middle East tensions linger, deadly clashes in Iraqi\n\nunrest\n\n* U.S.-China trade talks to focus minds later in week\n\n\n\n(Adds comments, updates prices)\n\nBy Florence Tan\n\nSINGAPORE, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday,\n\nextending last week's heavy losses, with traders fearing the\n\nglobal economic slowdown will weigh on future oil demand growth\n\nwhile pegging hopes for a rebound on progress in talks this week\n\non ending the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nBrent crude futures edged down 28 cents to $58.09 a\n\nbarrel by 0300 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI)\n\ncrude was at $52.64, down 17 cents.\n\nBoth contracts ended last week with a more-than-5% decline\n\nafter dismal manufacturing data from the United States and\n\nChina, as the lingering row between the world's top economies\n\nhurts global growth and raises the risk of recession.\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials will meet in Washington on Oct.\n\n10-11 in the next, much-anticipated fresh effort to work out a\n\ndeal.\n\nOn the supply side, a faster-than-expected resumption in\n\nSaudi Arabia's production after a Sept. 14 attack on key\n\nproduction facilities also exerted downward pressure on oil\n\nprices, although the Middle East remained tense. \"The macro headwinds outweigh supply concerns for oil now,\n\ndespite tensions in the Middle East and a reduced spare capacity\n\npillow,\" said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at\n\nAxiCorp.\n\nIn Iraq, the second-largest producer among the Organization\n\nof the Petroleum Exporting Countries, deadly anti-government\n\nunrest is posing the biggest security and political challenge so\n\nfar to Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi's year-old government.\n\nIraq's oil exports of 3.43 million barrels per day (bpd)\n\nfrom Basra terminals could be disrupted if instability lasts for\n\nweeks, Ayham Kamel, Eurasia Group's practice head for Middle\n\nEast and North Africa, said in a note.\n\n\"Any oil production disruption would occur at a time when\n\nSaudi Arabia has lost a significant part of its energy system\n\nredundancies (spare capacity),\" he said.\n\n\"While Saudi oil production is now close to 9.9 million bpd,\n\nit is not clear that the capacity is fully operational at 11.3\n\nmillion bpd and the (attacked) Abqaiq facility has lost a\n\nsignificant part of its redundancy.\"\n\nGlobal supply also faces facility repair and maintenance\n\npressures.\n\nThe Buzzard oil field in the British North Sea has been shut\n\nfor pipe repair work, a spokesman from China's CNOOC said on\n\nFriday. Buzzard is the main contributor to the Forties crude\n\nstream, the largest of the five North Sea oil grades that\n\nunderpin Brent crude futures.\n\nMeanwhile Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on\n\nSunday it will close the Faregh oil field at Zueitina port for\n\nscheduled maintenance from Monday until Oct. 14.", "description": "UPDATE 1-Oil prices on ebb tide as gloom gathers over global economy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEBB70BB_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
