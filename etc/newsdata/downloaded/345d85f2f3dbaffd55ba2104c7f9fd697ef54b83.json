Buckley Jr.\n\nWe rise and shine this morning to find we have passed $100,000 in contributions to NR\u2019s 2019 Spring Webathon. An undeniable milestone that! But also undeniable: NR needs to raise at least $75,000 more (and more on top of that if at all possible). What motivates someone to give? There are as many reasons as there are donors \u2014 God bless them, each and every one \u2014 some of whom anticipated your curiosity by sharing their moolah-transferring raisons d\u2019\u00eatre:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Dixie drops $100 on us and . . . maybe it signifies resignation: \u201cAll right, all right, all right already!\u201d Well, Dixie, what\u2019s all right is everything about you. Thanks so much.\n\n\u2022 Mark and Kristine tag-team a $250 donation and share their familial happiness: \u201cAbout to send my oldest off to college. Thankfully she is grounded and not succumbed to the views of the left. (I\u2019ve even caught her listening to the Great Books Podcast!) So grateful to NR for clear, logical content with which we can arm her as she enters the lions\u2019 den.\u201d\n\n\u2022 William went for the barrel-of-oil donation suggestion, but (and we should never say \u201cbut\u201d regarding generosity) his contribution is for $55.22, shy of the $63.26 suggested. Assuming we\u2019d want that difference explained, he supplies such: \u201cI\u2019m sending a barrel of crude. But it is North Dakota Light Sweet, which goes at almost an $8/Bbl discount to WTI partially thanks to the anti-infrastructure keep-it-in-the ground groups. Keep up the good work.\u201d Thanks William, this is truly sweet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Philip finds $200 and segments his generosity: \u201c$25 each for Williamson, Goldberg, Cooke, and McCarthy to keep pounding out their great work. And another $100 because NRO is essential daily reading for me.\u201d It all adds up to selflessness. Thanks!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Stephen is good for 100 bucks, and throws in a plug for NRPLUS: \u201cI\u2019ve been reading NR since my younger days and was a fairly early member of NRPLUS. I\u2019ve enjoyed the call-ins and I\u2019m especially looking forward to the Dan Crenshaw (my congressman) on the 29th. Keep up the good work!\u201d Keeping . . . because you keep keeping.\n\n\u2022 Big Bad Paul forks over the same amount, and speaks for a lot of people with his attending comment: \u201cOne of the things I enjoy about NR is that it\u2019s open to a wide range of conservative viewpoints, a range that other media sources never see to acknowledge.\u201d Bingo!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Okay, this will be the last, because it\u2019s hard to top: Stephen gave a thousand bucks and then throws down an amazing trump card: \u201cI had dinner with Mr. Buckley when I was a college student at Lehigh University in the \u201960s. Life-altering experience.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019d love to know more about that experience, Stephen (why not email us and share details if you wish?). And we\u2019d love for folks who, whether directly or from afar, found their lives altered by what Bill Buckley did through NR, and what NR continues to do for conservatism (combatting socialism tooth and nail!), to help keep this enterprise fortified and fighting on behalf of our mutually shared beliefs. Maybe you can\u2019t match Stephen\u2019s grand (But, what if you can?! Maybe you can even surpass that amazing generosity!), but please consider donating s what your wallet might permit. Is it $10 or $100 or $500 or even $55.22? No matter, it will used consequentially.\n\nNearly 900 people have donated so far, but again: We remain far short of our $175,000 goal (given our true needs, we could have set a goal double that). So here\u2019s the plan: You donate to the 2019 Spring Webathon so we can sock socialism in the mouth. No worry of you want to do that in old-fashioned mode: Mail your deeply appreciated contribution (made payable to \u201cNational Review\u201d) to National Review, ATTN: Spring 2019 Webathon, 19 West 44th Street, New York, NY 10036. God bless!\n\n", "description": "Donate to the 2019 Spring Webathon so we can sock socialism in the mouth.", "authors": ["Nr Staff", "Andrew C. Mccarthy", "Kevin D.
