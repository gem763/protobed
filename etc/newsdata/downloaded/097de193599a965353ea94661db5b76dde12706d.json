Now they have changed the mood for this desperately poignant study of a retired middle-aged couple, Joan and Tom, who have, over the years, come to terms with the deep sadness in their hearts following the death of their daughter. Now their fragile relationship is further tested when Joan is diagnosed with breast cancer. Is it too much to bear? Or has their existing grief somehow partly numbed, or inoculated them against the more commonplace pain of getting cancer in your 60s?\n\nClemency review \u2013 Alfre Woodard dominates devastating prison drama Read more\n\nThe movie is written by Owen McCafferty and acted with impeccable intelligence and sensitivity by Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson. And although there are some slightly stereotypical weepie moments, the film has a strong sense of emotional purpose and Manville and Neeson \u2013 perhaps especially Manville \u2013 bring conviction and force. It is, perhaps, something we have all seen before in the movies when a character goes to talk to the gravestone of a departed loved one. But this film does something different with the trope when the couple are in the car and Tom announces that he is going to the cemetery. Joan, with deadly seriousness, tells him not to mention her cancer: \u201cI don\u2019t want her to know.\u201d\n\nOrdinary Love is a film with a cloud-cover of ordinariness. Cinematographer Piers McGrail gives it a stark, flat light: subdued in the couple\u2019s kitchen and dining room, and also on the seafront where they go for daily, healthy walks, Tom genially obsessing over his Fitbit and the number of steps he has taken \u2013 but a stronger and more clinical light in the hospital.\n\nOver the years, the couple have got comfortable with a kind of endless, soft-edged banter; it\u2019s a language they have developed for amiable co-existence, and of course it crumbles in the face of Joan\u2019s awful news, replaced with anger, recrimination and fear.\n\nThere is a horrible, and all too real, choreography of agony when Tom and Joan are placidly seated in the hospital waiting area and Tom announces he needs to go to the lavatory; Joan testily tells him not to be long, because her name could be called at any moment \u2013 and course it is, the moment Tom has gone. The uneasy, uncomfortable wait for Tom to return from the loo so they can all troop in to see the doctor is an ordeal of banal embarrassment. But there is a kind of redemption when the couple unexpectedly see someone they know \u2013 and dislike \u2013 in the waiting room.\n\nThere are, arguably, scenes in this film which are less than subtle \u2013 and there were times when I wanted something more indirect. But Manville and Neeson have a real empathy and intimacy on screen. Perhaps it is partly Manville\u2019s presence, which reminded me a little of Mike Leigh, in films like Another Year.
