Gilchrist-Petty wrote to me in an email that of all their findings, she was most surprised that engaged couples were the most skeptical. Engaged couples may be particularly protective of their relationships because they\u2019re almost across the matrimonial finish line, she posited, \u201cand do not want anything or anyone, including a cross-sex best friend, to potentially jeopardize their upcoming marriage.\u201d In the study, she and Bennett also note that engaged couples are in a uniquely stressful situation compared with single, dating, and married people: Not only are they transitioning to become assumed life partners, they wrote in the study, \u201cbut they are often dealing with \u2026 merging lives and planning a wedding.\u201d As they note in the study, this can include family problems as well as financial constraints, both of which are known to place long-term stress on people and relationships.\n\nRead: Why women so rarely propose to men\n\nStress can certainly be a risk factor for feelings of jealousy, Solomon noted. \u201cWhen any of us are under stress, we do kind of regress a bit, and fall back on less healthy ways of coping. Insecurity can spike, and if you\u2019re not particularly comfortable in your own skin, you\u2019re more likely to want to control the world around you,\u201d she told me. \u201cI think staring down this really big identity shift\u2014a relationship-status shift, a life-commitment shift\u2014just awakens insecurity that we don\u2019t always know how best to cope with. So to get controlling of a partner would would just seem like a way of coping.\u201d An unhealthy way of coping, to be sure, she added, \u201cbut it\u2019s understandable.\u201d\n\nSolomon also lauded the study\u2019s efforts to consider feelings of jealousy and expressions of jealousy separately. They\u2019re often conflated, she told me\u2014for example, the concept of a \u201cjealous lover\u201d is commonly invoked to describe both lovers who feel jealousy and lovers who exhibit controlling behaviors toward their partners. To consider the feeling of jealousy as something that may not necessarily have a corresponding action, she said, can help destigmatize it and clarify why people might be particularly vulnerable to it.\n\n\u201cMaybe this is another reason why engaged couples struggle the most,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen we fall in love and make a commitment to someone, we become actually, neurophysiologically tied to them. Our intimate partners live in our bones; they matter so much that they co-regulate each other\u2019s physiology. So of course, [anything that gives] the sense of, Oh my God, I\u2019m gonna lose you, is really threatening and terrifying. But that\u2019s separate and apart from what you do with that.\u201d In other words, she said, there\u2019s a strong distinction to be made between I love you, and I\u2019m reckoning with how much I need you and I love you, so I have to control you because I\u2019m so afraid of losing you.", "description": "Can straight men and women really be best friends?
