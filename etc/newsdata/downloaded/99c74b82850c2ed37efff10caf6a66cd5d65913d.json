We now know that other top officials were listening in on that call, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nWhich makes Pompeo's response to ABC's Martha Raddatz -- when asked directly on September 22 about the whistleblower complaint based, in part, on that call -- all the more, uh, interesting. Or, to pick another word: Evasive.\n\nHere's the exchange:\n\nRADDATZ: And I want to turn to this whistleblower complaint, Mr. Secretary. The complaint involving the President and a phone call with a foreign leader to the director of national intelligence inspector general. That's where the complaint was launched by the whistle-blower. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that President Trump pressed the president of Ukraine eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani to investigate Joe Biden's son. What do you know about those conversations?\n\nPOMPEO: So, you just gave me a report about a I.C. whistle-blower complaint, none of which I've seen. I can tell you about this administration's policies with Ukraine. I remember the previous administration was begged -- begged by the Ukrainian people to deliver defensive arms, so that they could protect themselves from Vladimir Putin and Russia. And they gave them blankets. This administration took seriously the responsibility of the Ukrainian people. We've provided now on multiple occasions resources, so that the -- the Ukrainians can defend themselves. We've worked on that. We -- we're working -- we'll see President Zelensky this week. We want a good relationship with the Ukrainian people.\n\nRead More", "description": "On July 25, Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, talked on the phone, a call that has become the centerpiece of Democrats' impeachment inquiry into the US President.
