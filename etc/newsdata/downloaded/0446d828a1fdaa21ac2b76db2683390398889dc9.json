However, McNaughten can console herself with a top-four finish and the knowledge that she is paid slightly more than the other six High Court judges ($551,880).\n\nBar none: Solicitor-General Stephen Donaghue QC outside the High Court. AAP\n\nHowever, Crennan falls some way short of the gold medallist \u2013 Solicitor-General Stephen Donaghue QC. The government's chief legal adviser and principal High Court advocate is on a base salary of $775.910.\n\nThat's the same mark as ASIC chair James Shipton. Curiously, Shipton and Crennan are paid more than ACCC chief Rod Sims ($581.940).\n\nStill, it\u2019s pretty good coin and not far off what Crennan would have taken home if he was still at the private bar as a relatively new silk (he was anointed in 2016).\n\nOops, forgot about that\n\nThe extra detail in the 2018-19 ASIC annual report was mandatory after The Treasury (Enhancing ASIC\u2019s Capabilities) Act 2018 removed the regulator as a statutory agency. (Part of enhancing ASIC's capabilities was to give it more salary room/flexibility.)\n\nAs a statutory agency, it was a \"prescribed authority\" for the purposes of the Public Interest Disclosure (PID) Act, which is meant to protect whistleblowers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the geniuses at Treasury forgot about that bit. So, from July 1 \u2013 when the Act took effect \u2013 until October 11 there was no PID safeguard for anyone who wanted to spill the beans on ASIC's inner workings.\n\nOn that day, Attorney-General Christian Porter quietly restored ASIC's status as a prescribed authority. He didn't say when staff were made aware of \"ASIC\u2019s inadvertent removal from the scope of the PID Act\" but thankfully there were no sweaty palms. \"No public interest disclosures were made during the period 1 July 2019 and 11 October 2019,'' said Porter.\n\nLucky 13 for bar's rising star\n\nBarrister Renee Enbom has worked on several high-profile cases. Eddie Jim\n\nMelbourne barrister Renee Enbom\u2019s reputation as rising star was confirmed on Wednesday when Victoria Chief Justice Anne Ferguson announced a new batch of silks.\n\nEnbom was junior to bar president Matt Collins QC for Rebel Wilson\u2019s stoush with Bauer Media and is now going into bat for Victoria Police at the Lawyer X royal commission.\n\n\u201cPerfect for a young silk,\u201d Collins told Hearsay. (He has a cruel streak.)\n\nOn a more serious note, Collins \u2013 who passes the baton to Wendy Harris QC next month \u2013 reckons the bar is near the tipping point when it comes to appointing women as silk. Of the 18 appointed this year, five were female.\n\n\u201cMore than 40 per cent of barristers who have been at the Victorian Bar for 15 years and under are women. Most silks are appointed after about 15 to 20 years as a barrister [Ms Enbom took only 13], which means I have every expectation that the pool of women silk candidates in the next few years, at least at our bar, should start to approach parity with men.\u201d", "description": "There are only two lawyers on the public purse who earn more than the High Court Chief Justice \u2013 and one of them is ASIC deputy chairman Daniel Crennan QC.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7078%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_173/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ba78034ed4c1f92aaa7b5c41e041fbffe008a4d2", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
