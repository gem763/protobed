She presents just two pieces: a towering, faux-Victorian fountain and a smaller sculpture shaped like an oyster. Both are immediately charming, yet they tell a sorrowful story about slavery, colonisation and \u201cmerchant trade\u201d (to use a euphemism that Henry Tate\u2019s sugar company might itself have preferred).\n\nThe elegant tiers, sweeping ovals and prettily pattering water of the huge fountain make for a fine pastiche of Victorian memorials. Public monuments were built by the victors of history to celebrate their feats, legitimise their abuses, exult in their spoils and anchor their power. Walker\u2019s monumental rebuke rises up palely: white supremacy built on black degradation. She makes visible the black women, children and men who were exploited and erased, and does so in a sardonic reclamation of the perpetrators\u2019 own visual language.\n\nThe human figures that decorate her fountain are emaciated and bedraggled, abandoned, thrashing in misery, contorted and abject. Others are swollen with greed and pride, dressed in ill-fitting nautical costumes or a caricatured ensemble of imagined African \u201cnational dress\u201d. All caper round the fountain in a horrifying, mocking death dance. The fountain\u2019s greyish-white surface is like a decayed plaster of Paris mantelpiece ornament or a gone-off wedding cake: the rot after the celebration.\n\nIt frustrates me that a woman artist of colour is expected to continually \u201ctackle\u201d racism and misogyny\n\nVisitors with even a passing familiarity with art history and visual culture will recognise the classical and folkloric allusions to discarded, damned creatures drowning and starving; slave-driving captains of industry puffed up to a cartoonish degree; Britannia\u2019s multi-sailed merchant ships; natural bounty being scooped up by intrepid exploiters; and the fetishised rendering of black women as \u201cMother Africa\u201d figures, bountiful of hip and lip and bosom and rump. At the top of the fountain a woman rises up triumphantly \u2013 except her clothes are ripped off, her breasts bared and her throat slit, spurting water like blood to fill up the fountain.\n\nOne of the other sculpted forms around the fountains is a tree with a noose dangling from one branch. The lynching tree itself is splayed and flayed like a human body struck by lightning, a martyred and violated form with an unmistakably vaginal cleft. Walker integrates the stories of black suffering, female suffering and high art history itself, for the woman/tree also resembles a creature of myth, a punished victim turned to stone by a curse.\n\nThe text printed on the wall in wild west \u201cwanted\u201d poster font calls for our attention like a circus ringmaster: the two works, it says mockingly, are presented as a \u201cgift and talisman\u2026 an allegorical wonder\u201d, a story of \u201cAfrique and Albion\u201d. The register unites pioneer pomp with music hall theatricality. It demonstrates Walker\u2019s feel for mass culture and kitschy allure, carnivalesque anarchy, funhouse horror and postmodern irreverence. The sharks that slump out of the fountain remind us of the perils of voyages by sea, mix images of blood and water, make reference to Damien Hirst\u2019s work from the 90s and have the schlocky stiffness of Jaws, all at once.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nThe Turbine Hall is a tough space and the fountain is plonked at the end. The other, much smaller piece, is awkwardly parked higher up the slope. It\u2019s shaped like an oyster, greeting you like an amuse-bouche before the rich feast of allusions that is the fountain. The oyster is sensitively moulded, rising like a protective hood. In the nub where a pearl should be is a child\u2019s soft face, pouring tears that dribble down its cheeks. Looking at this piece at a time when headlines abound of police officers killing unarmed young black citizens, one feels sorrowful and protective. There is a heartbreaking vulnerability to the face, with its beseeching eyes, delicately waved hair and the childlike gap between the teeth. The child, like the pearl, should be treasured and protected; but the lived experience of racism, like the pearl, develops over time through a slow, dark accretion and a hardening realisation.\n\nTurbine Hall artist Kara Walker: 'Apparently, the only thing I am is black' Read more\n\nAs the first black woman to headline at the Turbine Hall, Kara Walker is of course to be celebrated. But it frustrates me as both a critic and an artist (making films and stills, mainly) that a woman artist of colour is expected to continually \u201ctackle\u201d racism and misogyny, diversity and inclusion, slavery, colonialism, oppression and the suffering self.\n\nNonetheless, Walker\u2019s sophisticated work here is both thought-provoking and entertaining. The themes of refuge denied, forced movement, confinement, cruel disdain, peril and death at sea are just as relevant now as centuries before. Past, present and future, English and American, African and European stories elide into one. The works are not monuments to history but a warning for a frightening world in which we are failing to learn the lessons of the past or stop its repetition.\n\n\u2022 Kara Walker: Fons Americanus is at the Turbine Hall, Tate Modern, London, until 5 April 2020", "description": "The American\u2019s bold subversion of exultant Victorian kitsch charms even as it cuts to the quick of slavery and refuge denied", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20b38416a66b15260182f09998a5c5afc3eddcaf/0_114_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5ed6fe10b99bf814f1e4bcbd06d47614", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
