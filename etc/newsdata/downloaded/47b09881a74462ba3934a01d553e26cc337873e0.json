I am not going to tell you what to do. But I have a suggestion. Remind/explain to yourself why you have each holding and the purpose it serves in your bond sleeve. Where are you taking interest rate risk? Where are you taking credit risk? Do you have sufficient defense? Looking under the hood of the cumulative funds are you making any lopsided bets on individual bond asset classes? After this exercise, apply your own logic, evaluation and conclusion and I have confidence you can answer your own question. Good luck. Ciao for now, Paul", "description": "Being Retired and Buying DLFNX when it had its comming out to play Party Its been a Marginal holding, but 5% Core Holding none the least Would you Keep - 20826", "authors": ["Explorer", "Participant"], "top_image": "https://zwcdr85544.i.lithium.com/html/assets/favicon.ico?15D4DC4041FDD3CD56F6121736C9C68D"}
