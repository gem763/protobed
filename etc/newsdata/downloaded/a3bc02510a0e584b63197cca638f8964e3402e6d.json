Instead, it was pretty puny,\" Yardeni said. \"The market is hanging in there and should do better over the rest of the year.\"\n\nYardeni, who spent decades on the Street running investment strategy for firms that include Prudential and Deutsche Bank, builds his bullish case on the notion that Washington and Beijing agree to a trade war deal, a strong U.S. jobs market that'll keep consumers spending and a global economy on the mend due to easy central bank policies.\n\nThe positive developments will create momentum for growth stocks through 2020, according to Yardeni. He doubts value, which recently got a bid higher, will outperform in the coming months.\n\n\"This has been a very interesting bull market. It seems to every now and then let the leaders become laggards and the laggards become leaders. There is a lot of rotation going on in this market from the get-go,\" he said. \"I don't know if I'd read too much into it.\"\n\nYardeni contends investors were drawn to value because it got so cheap, writing in a recent note \"forward P/Es of growth and value stocks hadn't been this wide since the go-go days of the tech bubble and its aftermath.\"\n\nHe speculates growth stocks will be lead the market to new highs, listing consumer discretionary, semiconductors and financials as the biggest beneficiaries.\n\n\"The economy is doing fine and the fundamentals for stocks moving higher are still intact,\" Yardeni said.", "description": "Yardeni Research's Edward Yardeni believes the U.S. economy is picking up steam.", "authors": ["Stephanie Landsman"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105545502-1541075200793img_0323r.jpg?v=1562876755", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
