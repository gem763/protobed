It ended with them standing stiffly in the twilight as guests arrived for dinner. His mouth turned down. Her face without affect.\n\nIn the morning, President Trump and first lady Melania Trump walked out of the White House holding hands and took their place overlooking the South Lawn. The jacket of his navy suit was buttoned; a tiny American flag was pinned to his lapel. She wore a powder blue dress with balloon sleeves from the Australian brand Scanlan Theodore. It was a gracious nod to her guests.\n\nHer posture was as rigid as his as they stood shoulder-to-shoulder awaiting the arrival of the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his wife, Jenny. The president did not turn to chat with his wife; she did not turn toward him. They did not smile. She took a deep breath.\n\nWhen the Morrisons stepped out of their motorcade, the rigidity relaxed. The Australians ambled forward. The president chuckled. The first lady bent down from atop her skyscraper snake pumps to greet Jenny Morrison with a kiss. Mrs. Trump smiled.\n\nThis was the second state visit the Trumps have hosted. The first, in April 2018, was in honor of France and for that day\u2019s arrival ceremony, the first lady paired her white Michael Kors suit with a matching hat commissioned by her stylist Herv\u00e9 Pierre, who had also designed her inaugural gown. That hat was quite a spectacle; it was both dramatic and protective, its brim serving as a kind of force field to ward off unwanted displays of affection.\n\n[For Melania Trump, fashion diplomacy was defined by a hat]\n\nShe wore nothing quite so theatrical Friday morning. Her blue dress, which sells for $800 on the Scanlan Theodore website, was quite workmanlike in its simplicity. Crafted from crepe knit, it\u2019s the sort of dress a professional woman might pack into her carry-on confident that it wouldn\u2019t wrinkle.\n\n\n\nThe first couple with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his wife, Jenny Morrison, wave from the South Portico balcony following a state arrival ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House.

Mendel. The dress had an ethereal quality as it fluttered in the September air. The president\u2019s tuxedo jacket was maddeningly unbuttoned.\n\nMrs. Trump has worn gowns from J. Mendel before, most notably last year when she chose a yellow pleated dress with a cape-like train for a visit to Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. The designs, by the brand\u2019s creative director Gilles Mendel, tend to be classically feminine, but with a hint of drama and Old World panache. They are dignified.\n\nThis was not a one-of-a-kind creation from Mendel but rather a dress that was part of his spring 2019 collection and one that could be purchased off the rack at Bergdorf Goodman for $5,990. (By the time Mrs. Trump debuted it, the dress was marked down to a mere $1,497 and came with free shipping. And before the evening ended, it was sold out. )\n\n[Full transcript: The toasts of President Trump and Prime Minister Scott Morrison at the state dinner for Australia]\n\nThere\u2019s a kind of brave and, perhaps cocky, transparency in choosing a dress that is available off the rack. The cost of it is right there for anyone who wishes to know \u2014 and, undoubtedly, judge. First ladies are responsible for the cost of their own wardrobe. But even if they\u2019re not footing the bill, taxpayers have always deemed the first lady\u2019s public wardrobe to be a public matter. The cost is a moral test and frugality is next to godliness.\n\nOne could also argue that there\u2019s something mildly accessible about an off-the-rack frock \u2014 no matter the cost. If you\u2019ve got the money, it can be yours. No special connection or status is required. There is one-percenter camaraderie in Mrs. Trump\u2019s pale green confection that nods ever so slightly to the national colors of Australia, which are green and gold.\n\n\n\nThe first couple wait to welcome Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his wife, Jenny Morrison, at the North Portico.

Mrs. Bush was one of four women wearing the same $8,500 red Oscar de la Renta dress. (Mrs. Bush ultimately dashed to the residence and changed.)\n\nThe price tag can often distract from fashion\u2019s distinctive currency: its ability to speak eloquently about culture, identity and status. The president\u2019s tuxedo \u2014 classic but unbuttoned \u2014 suggests that he will play to traditions at least for the evening but he\u2019s not fully committed to the pesky details and niceties.\n\n[Complete guest list for the state dinner in honor of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison]\n\nWhat does the first lady\u2019s choice of attire say on these grand occasions?\n\nMrs. Trump\u2019s clothes have sometimes spoken with quiet respect. She wore Chanel haute couture when she welcomed French president Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte to the White House for the state dinner last year. Mrs. Trump has also fired off a vitriolic message of disregard with a Zara jacket graffitied with \u201cI Really Don\u2019t Care. Do U?\u201d But mostly, her clothes simply say, \u201cAnd so, I am here.\u201d\n\nThey announce that she is standing in the role. And when duty calls, she will take a deep breath. And be present.\n\n\n\nThe first couple greet their guests.
