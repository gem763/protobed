It\u2019s a wild ride.\u201d\n\nThe visit has brought a touch of Tinseltown to Asia\u2019s largest film festival, with hundreds of fans camping outside the Busan Cinema Centre in preparation for a red carpet walk from the stars before an evening outdoor screening.\n\n\u201cI did not expect this kind of welcome in Korea,\u201d said Chalamet. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply gratifying.\u201d\n\nAmong those to have played King Henry V in the past are acclaimed British actors Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh, while more recently Tom Hiddleson tackled the role in the BBC\u2019s award-winning \u201cThe Hollow Crown\u201d series in 2012.\n\nThe New York-raised Chalamet said he had called up the services of an English speech coach in order to nail the accent, but had been more concerned with working \u201cthrough the lens of the 15th century\u201d.\n\n\u201cI went to a drama high school and one of the things the teachers there wanted us to learn was to choose the roles that are daunting rather than the roles that are in your wheel house, or that you are more comfortable with,\u201d said Chalamet.\n\nHe said Henry was \u201cuniversally relatable\u201d for youngsters who \u201cdon\u2019t have the skill set, mentally or socially, to deal with the circumstances\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am excited that a new generation can see his kind of material,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a great opportunity and I had to jump at it.\u201d\n\nAustralian Michod, previously acclaimed for his gritty crime world drama \u201cAnimal Kingdom\u201d (2010), said when writing the screenplay with Edgerton they had turned to the work of Shakespeare as a \u201cstarting point\u201d, but then had created a story of their own.\n\n\u201cVery early we decided to build a story of our own, taking some pieces from Shakespeare, taking stuff from the deep research that we did, but also just making stuff up,\u201d said Michod.\n\n\u201cBut it is testament to the power of his writing that even though it is so old it still feels relevant today.\u201d", "description": "Busan (South Korea) (AFP) \u2013 Hollywood A-lister Timothee Chalamet admits he was intimidated by the prospect of playing the title role in a new film", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/e7b1ab_timothee-chalamet-is-latest-us-actor-tackle-shakespeare-playing-henry-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
