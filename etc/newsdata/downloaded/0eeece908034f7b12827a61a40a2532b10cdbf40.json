But the year-to-date gain of more than 38% for the stock is still well below the triple-digit-percentage jump for OrganiGram earlier this year.\n\nPrevious performance doesn't matter very much when it comes to how well OrganiGram might fare in the future. Is this pot stock still a smart pick for long-term investors?\n\nCannabis leaf inside a miniature shopping cart on top of a pile of cash. More\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nMarket potential\n\nThe single most important determinant for OrganiGram's future success is just how big the global cannabis market can grow. You'll hear some cannabis industry executives talk about a $150 billion potential market. That number stems from a United Nations estimate of the illegal worldwide cannabis market size. Getting to a $150 billion market assumes that marijuana will become legal everywhere it's currently illegal. Maybe that could happen, but it will take a long time.\n\nAnother more realistic projection comes from Statista, which estimates that the global legal cannabis market will grow from $20.1 billion in 2018 to $63.5 billion by 2024. This figure is in the ballpark of the $66.3 billion global cannabis market in 2025 predicted by Grand View Research.\n\nHowever, this estimates don't include hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD) sales. OrganiGram touts Brightfield Group's projection of a $22 billion U.S. hemp CBD market by 2022. That estimate, however, is much higher than others. Hemp Industry Daily forecasts a $7 billion U.S. hemp CBD market by 2023.\n\nOrganiGram's positioning\n\nNo matter how you look at it, the growth potential for the global cannabis market appears to be quite promising. But can OrganiGram capitalize on this market growth? There's a good case for the company's prospects.\n\nCapacity will be a must to succeed. OrganiGram currently can produce around 89,000 kilograms of cannabis annually. By the end of this year, the company should boost that level to 113,000 kilograms per year. That's enough to rank OrganiGram in the top 10 Canadian cannabis producers in terms of annual production capacity.\n\nFor now, at least, the Canadian adult-use recreational market is the most important focus for OrganiGram. The company is one of only four Canadian cannabis producers with supply agreements in place with all of Canada's provinces. OrganiGram also appears to be well positioned for the cannabis derivatives market that will soon open with its partnerships with vape technology companies Pax Labs and Feather Company and its investment in a fully automated production line for chocolate cannabis edibles.\n\nOver the long run, international medical cannabis and CBD markets will present even greater opportunities. OrganiGram has key partnerships with German medical cannabis distributor Alpha-Cannabis and Serbia-based hemp CBD company Eviana. The company expects to increase its international operations in the future.\n\nIncreasing revenue is important, but so is actually making a profit -- something that few cannabis producers are doing right now. Although OrganiGram reported a modest loss in its latest quarter due to fair-value changes to assets and inventories, the company continues to be profitable on an operating basis. Its low cost of cultivation gives OrganiGram a key competitive advantage over many of its peers.", "description": "The answer is more complicated than it might seem.", "authors": ["Keith Speights", "The Motley Fool"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eyFZL1W7unqNYjzylKAZsA--~B/aD01MjU7dz03MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/16145a6ee1616a2c05087fa1b9673f10", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
