No Sesso, the L.A.-based line by Pierre Davis, is named for the words \u201cno gender\u201d in Italian. The unisex clothes, and the cast of spirited models who stomped down the runway in them, prompted more than a few hearty smiles from the too-cool audience. No Sesso forecasts a very \u201890s spring filled with bucket hats, spray-painted shirts, and butt cleavage galore. A cotton candy color palette softened tough silhouettes. Suits came oversized, but skirts ran super short. Nods to the naughties included corset tops, Bermuda shorts, and ultra-baggy sweatshirts.\n\nAlaina Demopoulos", "description": "At Fashion Week, Christian Siriano celebrated the power of art; Telfar revealed a theme of migration; No Sesso celebrated gender fluidity, and Taoray Wang was all about Colette.", "authors": ["Alaina Demopoulos", "Sarah Shears", "Summer Eldemire", "Tim Teeman", "Style Writer", "Cheat Sheet Intern", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567895080/190907-demopolous-teeman-nyfw-hero-1_zke9ei", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
