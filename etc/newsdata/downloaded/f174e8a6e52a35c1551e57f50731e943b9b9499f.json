Mulvaney later walked back his comments.\n\n\u201cTizzy! Damn, Grisham\u2019s a truth-teller,\u201d quipped Cooper. \u201cI mean, you know what, let the chips fall where they may. Stephanie don\u2019t care. Does everyone working for the president have to debase themselves and lie like he does? Apparently so. I thought John Grisham was a great storyteller, but I got to say, Stephanie Grisham may have him beat.\u201d\n\nCooper also poked fun at Grisham\u2019s claim that reporters were simply trying to make names for themselves with stories that were critical of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cI hate to break it to her, TV reporters are already on TV. So no need to try to get on TV, because that\u2019s where they work, on TV,\u201d said Cooper. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to grasp but it\u2019s actually how the entire TV medium works. I am on TV right now. Newspaper reporters, they are covering the White House so they probably already made a name for themselves. You know what I mean?\u201d\n\nCheck out the segment here:\n\n\"Ms. Grisham clearly doesn't get to Broadway enough if she thinks those press conferences are theatre.\" \ud83c\udfad\n\n\n\nOn the #Ridiculist, @AndersonCooper pokes fun at some of the recent turns of phrase offered by rarely seen White House press sec.
