I was terrified and I had no idea what was happening.\n\n\"I was referred to the complex pain clinic, but didn't see them until April 2014.\n\n\"When we got to the clinic, the doctor was able to diagnose me almost immediately. Complex pain clinics are reserved for rare conditions so by the time a patient gets to them, the more common diseases have already been ruled out.\n\n(Image: MDW Features/Mackenzie Lea)\n\n\"I talked with the doctor for a couple of minutes about my scans and he medication I had tried.\n\n\"He decided to do a physical exam and he asked if the pain affects one side, so I said it was mostly on my right side.\n\n\"He asked if it would hurt when he touched my face and I said that I'd rather him not touch it because it would hurt.\n\n\"Then he said he knew what I had and asked if I could give him a couple of minutes to do some research.\n\n(Image: MDW Features/Mackenzie Lea)\n\n\"When he came back, his face had gone from bright to pale and he said he'd never seen a case in children, but it was trigeminal neuralgia.\"\n\nMackenzie went through a number of emotions, but the dominant one was relief after finally being given a diagnosis.\n\nShe said: \"I told myself that once I had a diagnosis then they could treat me and I'd be fine. I never imagined that modern medicine wouldn't be able to treat something.\n\n\"The look on his face was a bit unsettling and I knew he was going to tell me something bad. I was told that it was a form of nerve damage that was very rare, and there wasn't an easy fix.\"\n\nShe has undergone surgery again and various treatments in a bid to reduce the pain.\n\nShe added: \"I had a second MVD (microvascular decompression) surgery in July and I haven't had complete relief from the pain, but the pain I do have is nowhere near as intense or frequent as it was before.\n\n\"I do have flare-ups now and then but it's not progressing.\"", "description": "Mackenzie Lea, 21, suffers excruciating pain when she does something as simple as putting on make-up, brushing her teeth or even talking", "authors": ["Alyce Collins", "Chris Kitching", "Image", "Mdw Features Mackenzie Lea"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20657393.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-The-No-Kissing-Disease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
