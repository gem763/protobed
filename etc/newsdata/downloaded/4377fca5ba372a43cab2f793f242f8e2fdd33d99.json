She learned to like it and found happiness, but some major things that bothered her were not going away with time, such as its location and lack of rigor. She also really wanted more friends and never found her group.\n\nShe was accepted (again) at her \"dream school\" that had many of the qualities she was looking for, but her fear of it being too hard was holding her back. After much thought, she decided to transfer to that college.\n\nAt first she was adjusting well, but a few things have her thinking she made the wrong decision. She is doing well academically, getting involved and has made a nice friend group \u2014 something she didn't have at her first school and desperately wanted. She recognizes her difficulties and is seeking advice from her former therapist.\n\nAs a parent, I am trying my best to support her and remind her the transition is still new and she needs to be mindful and open to all the good things her present situation has to offer. What else can I say to help?\n\n\u2014 Parent\n\nParent: Nothing comes to mind.\n\nWell, a lot of things come to mind, but I suspect the most helpful one is not to say any of them and let your daughter fend for herself.\n\nA major challenge of adulthood \u2014 perhaps the defining one \u2014 is the personal search for \u201cenough.\u201d Is this good thing enough of a reason to stay; is this bad thing enough of a reason to leave; do I like this enough to major in it; am I good enough to earn a living from it; am I working hard enough to get by or succeed; are these people reliable enough for me to count on; am I attentive enough to my friends; do I have enough of a purpose, and am I doing enough to fulfill it? Is this life enough? Am I enough.\n\n(And the defining challenge of parenthood, alas, is knowing when you\u2019ve \u201cparented\u201d enough.)\n\nOutside guidance can be a lifeline when we get lost during this existential search. However, it is essential to self-discovery that we do get lost sometimes, because that\u2019s what encourages resourcefulness, builds confidence and makes room for the unexpected.\n\nYou interfere with that process if you remind, support and advise your daughter every time she expresses doubt.\n\nSo let her be uncomfortable. Let her figure out whether it helps to get therapy or call you or lean on friends or keep her own counsel. Certainly let her ask you first, at least, before you weigh in, and even then, let her piece together her own advice by shaping your support into questions: \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d \u201cWhat have you tried so far?\u201d \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019ll do next?\u201d Even, \u201cIs it such a bad thing to be uncomfortable for a while?\u201d\n\nObviously you don\u2019t want to ignore signs of fragile mental health, if it comes to that \u2014 but your basic human can do a lot of second-guessing, churning, regretting, failing, agitating, misinterpreting, roiling, false-starting, even outright suffering, without risk of lasting harm. To help her with these, consider the truth: \u201cI understand. It\u2019s just hard sometimes.\u201d On you, too, I know.", "description": "Your daughter is doubting her college decision.
