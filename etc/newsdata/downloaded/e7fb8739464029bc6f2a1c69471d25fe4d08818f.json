(Picture: Triangle News)\n\nA girl was left paralysed from the neck down after she became dizzy doing handstands with her mum.\n\nMaisie Jones, nine, suddenly couldn\u2019t walk after doing the gymnastics, with seemingly no explanation.\n\nShe said she suddenly felt dizzy and her tummy hurt.\n\nHer mum Louise Jones took her to Southend Hospital but the family didn\u2019t receive a diagnosis.\n\nAccording to Mrs Jones the tummy ache was determined as \u2018chronic constipation\u2019 and the dizziness was unexplained.\n\nHer daughter was sent home and \u2018could hardly walk\u2019 before she was admitted again.\n\nMaisie Jones, 9, doing a handstand (Picture: Triangle News)\n\nBut in July, Maisie collapsed and was eventually transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital.\n\nAt her worst, she couldn\u2019t move from the neck down.\n\nDoctors eventually worked out she was suffering from Functional Neurological Disorder, which was highlighed by the handstands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaisie now has to use a wheelchair, has been taken out of school and hasn\u2019t walked unaided since July.\n\nMrs Jones, 47, said: \u2018It has been extremely stressful and it is breaking my heart.\n\n\u2018A little girl doing cartwheels and handstands and the next minute she can\u2019t walk with no real explanation.\n\n\u2018It was completely out of the blue.\u2019\n\nShe now needs to use a wheelchair (Picture: Triangle News)\n\nFND often impacts teenage girls and Maisie must now retrain her brain in order to walk again.\n\nShe is being homeschooled until she can finally get back on her feet.\n\nMaisie has had to move to a downstairs bedroom because she can no longer use the stairs.\n\nHer autistic brother, Tommy, five, has also struggled to cope.\n\n\u2018He doesn\u2019t understand why his sister can\u2019t play with him anymore,\u2019 Mrs Jones, of Hullbridge, Essex, said.\n\n\u2018Maisie gets upset because she can not get up and run around. She can\u2019t go to the park anymore because she gets too upset.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018My little boy keeps saying when Maisie is better everything will be normal again. We don\u2019t know which way to turn.\u2019\n\nThe family is now raising \u2018desperately needed\u2019 funds to pay for a private psychologist and therapist and for Maisie to have hydrotherapy treatment.\n\nMaisie Jones in hospital (Picture: Triangle News)\n\nCEO of The Brain Charity, Nanette Mellor, said: \u2018Functional Neurological Disorder is a much more common condition than many people think and, because it affects the brain, it can affect people in so many different ways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We have supported adults who have lost their jobs and their homes as a result and young people who have been rendered paralysed by it for months at a time.\n\n\u2018For many people with this condition, their whole lives will turn upside down.\n\n\u2018I think one of the most difficult aspects of having a diagnosis of FND is that really, we still have very little information about the causes of it and this really impedes our ability to find treatment.\n\n\u2018FND is also known as \u2018medically unexplained neurological symptoms\u2019 so what we are essentially saying is that we don\u2019t know what this is yet.\n\n\u2018The brain is such a complex and mysterious thing and we are only really just beginning to understand how to measure and assess what is going on inside it.\n\n\u2018So for those with FND, getting a diagnosis and remaining positive about finding treatment that will work for them is a long hard battle.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
