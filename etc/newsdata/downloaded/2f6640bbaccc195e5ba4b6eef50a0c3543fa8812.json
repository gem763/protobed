What will become of all your stuff?\n\nDon\u2019t worry \u2013 it probably isn\u2019t going anywhere. Here\u2019s what Apple is planning for iTunes in macOS Catalina.\n\nApple Music will become the home for all things, well, music.\n\nApple\n\nApple is redesigning the Music app for Macs to accommodate the elimination of iTunes.\n\nNow your entire music library will live inside one app, including downloaded songs, purchased songs, and songs ripped from a CD, according to Apple.\n\nPlus, you can still buy songs if you really want to: Apple will still offer an iTunes Store.\n\nThe Apple TV app is coming to the Mac.\n\nApple\n\nStarting this fall, the Apple TV app will live on all of your devices \u2013 iPhone, iPad, Mac, and, of course, your Apple TV.\n\nThat means that rather than renting movies and TV shows through iTunes on your Mac, you\u2019ll watch everything through the Apple TV app. Apple said that more than 100,000 iTunes shows and movies would be ported into the Apple TV app, and they will be available to rent or buy.\n\nThe app will include Apple TV channels, so you can stream shows and movies from your favourite channels and services (although that\u2019s less necessary on a Mac where you can also just watch them on the channel\u2019s website).\n\nOn top of that, the app will contain Apple\u2019s original streaming service, Apple TV Plus, once it becomes available this fall.\n\nApple Podcasts will now be a one-stop shop for all of your podcasts.\n\nApple\n\nThe way it works right now, there\u2019s a Podcasts app on the iPhone, but there\u2019s also a Podcasts section of iTunes on the Mac. This doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense, and thankfully, Apple is changing that.\n\nNow there will be a standalone Podcasts app on the Mac that should work the same as the one on your phone. Apple said it would offer more than 700,000 shows, as well as perks like the ability to get a notification when there\u2019s a new episode of one of your favourite shows.\n\nPlus, the app will feature curated collections and better search tools to help you find new podcasts to listen to.\n\nThere\u2019s one more crucial change involving iTunes coming in macOS Catalina.\n\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nYou know how right now, when you plug your iPhone into your Mac, iTunes opens automatically? Isn\u2019t it annoying?\n\nWell, Apple seems to have realised this because in macOS Catalina, nothing will happen when you plug your phone into your computer. Seriously \u2013 Apple even did a demo of this onstage at WWDC to prove it.\n\nNow when you plug your phone in, you\u2019ll see your device in the sidebar of your Finder and nothing more.\n\nHowever, Apple isn\u2019t eliminating using a cable to synch your phone and computer altogether \u2013 you\u2019ll still be able to sync your media that way, but you\u2019ll do it through the individual apps for music, movies, and podcasts.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
