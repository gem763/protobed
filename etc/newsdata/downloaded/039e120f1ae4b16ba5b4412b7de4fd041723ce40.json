But the man was able to return home after a brief hospital stay.\n\nAn unnamed 60-year-old man had a two inch-long Mother's Day cupcake topper removed from his throat after he accidentally swallowed it. It was lodged in his food pipe\n\nDoctors discovered the 'pink foreign body' which had caused trauma to his food pipe\n\nDoctors at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, treated the patient and reported it in The Journal of Emergency Medicine.\n\nHe turned up to the emergency department complaining of a sore throat and a 'foreign body sensation'.\n\nUpon questioning, the man told doctors his symptoms had started about a week prior, after he scoffed a cupcake on Mother's Day.\n\nThe man had already visited a different ER for his throat discomfort, but he was discharged after an X-ray of his neck showed no abnormalities.\n\nBut at Johns Hopkins, a CT scan was ordered, which produces images of the chest.\n\nA '5cm foreign body' could be seen in his oesophagus, which was inflamed and likely causing the man a lot of pain.\n\nWHAT IS THE DANGER OF A TEAR IN THE FOOD PIPE? A tear in the oesophagus, called oesophageal perforation, can lead to free fluid and air leaking into the chest cavity and organs. Severe complications include dehydration, infections, which can lead to sepsis, fluid on the lungs, a collapsed lung or cardiac arrest. Symptoms often revolve around a high fever, shortness of breath, and shock. Boerhaave's syndrome, medically known as spontaneous oesophageal rupture, is when the oesophagus ruptures. The condition is extremely rare, affecting only around three in a million people, and can be deadly within hours, killing around a third of patients who have it. Spontaneous oesophageal ruptures occur more frequently in men than women and typically affect those aged 40\u201360 years who overindulge in alcohol and food. It typically occurs after forcefully vomiting due to the sheer pressure.\n\nThere was a small cut, called an oesophageal perforation. It can be life-threatening if food or fluid escapes and enters the body.\n\nUntreated, the fluid can get trapped and lead to infection.\n\nPerforation is usually caused by extreme vomiting, and if the oesophagus ruptures, known as Boerhaave\u2019s syndrome, it can be deadly within hours.\n\nThe man underwent an upper endoscopy, a procedure in which doctors use a thin, flexible tube with a camera to look in the oesophagus.\n\nDoctors saw the 'pink foreign body' covered in food debris that was later confirmed to be a plastic cupcake topper.\n\nThe small tear was carefully repaired during the endoscopy, doctors said.\n\nThe man was hospitalised for four days for persistent swallowing problems, called dysphagia, but was back to his normal diet by the day of discharge.\n\nER doctors commonly see patients who have swallowed foreign bodies. Most do not pose danger and resolve by themselves.\n\nHowever up to one in five patients require removal by doctors, the report said.\n\nNo more than 1,500 deaths a year in the US are due to an object becoming lodged in the oesophagus. Figures in the UK are not clear.\n\nAround 18 per cent of patients who suffer an oesophagus tear from a foreign body will die.\n\nIt's most common for cases to be young children, but certain populations of adults are at risk, including those with psychiatric disorders, developmental delays and alcohol use disorder.\n\nAccording to the doctors, the man had an alcohol problem as well as epilepsy.\n\nThere is also a link between national holidays and ER patients with injuries to their food pipe, but it's normally due to over-indulgence, and not a foreign object.\n\nX-rays are often the first imaging tests ordered in cases like this one, but it may not spot objects such as plastic and glass, which was the case for this patient.\n\nIt also isn't able to spot perforation of the oesophagus, which would need treating quickly.", "description": "The man, who has not been named, had no idea the\u00a0decorative cake piece was lodged in his throat after scoffing the cake.
