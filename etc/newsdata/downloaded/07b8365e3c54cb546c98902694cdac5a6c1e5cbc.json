To navigate the uncertain road from teen phenom to major-title holder, the ambitious teen now has to improve just about every part of her game.\n\nGauff lost on Saturday to Naomi Osaka, the No. 1 player in the world and a winner of two Grand Slam titles, including last year\u2019s Open. Osaka, who crushes the ball and is aggressive, was dominant as she won the third-round match 6-3, 6-0.\n\nNow that Gauff\u2019s season is done, she will try to improve pretty much everything. And she has a lot of time. Her father and coach, Corey, does not worry about her short-term results. He plans to have Gauff slowly and efficiently improve in all aspects of the game.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not even what she\u2019s going to be like down the road,\u201d Corey said.\n\nGauff has been persistent since she began playing tennis at age 6. Still, at 15, she has a lot of work she plans to do. Gauff often hits volleys that are soft, rather than punched. She needs to improve her overhead smash, which is difficult for a player so young. Her groundstrokes are often too short, and her father will continue to help her on the backhand and forehand.\n\nGauff needs adjustments on her serve, too. For one, she needs to be more consistent. But she also needs to correct her footwork while serving. When Gauff lifts up a ball to serve, her right foot often starts to the right, rather than behind her left foot. Her father said he plans to help her fix this soon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on all of that: high volleys, half volleys, the strokes,\u201d Corey. \u201cSo we still have to stay in tune to make sure she\u2019s gripping the racket the right way and setting up her feet the right way until it becomes muscle memory. She\u2019s not quite there yet.\u201d\n\nNo one expected Gauff to win the U.S. Open. To win a major, players need skills, heath and even some luck. Belinda Bencic, age 22, is still hoping to break through from her U.S. Open quarterfinal in 2014. Genie Bouchard, now age 25, played a Wimbledon final in 2014. But Bouchard has not gone past the third round at a major in the last four years. Taylor Townsend, age 23, was a star in the juniors. She upset Simona Halep, a two-time major winner, this week, and on Saturday reached the fourth round for the first time in her career.\n\nUnlike these other young players, Gauff has something rare: absurd speed. Being fast and responding intuitively makes Gauff dangerous. Just when a play seems over, she can sprint and slide to return the ball. Patrick Mouratoglou, who coaches Serena Williams, said Gauff is likely the fastest player in women\u2019s tennis.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t hit a drop shot, because Gauff is going to get there, and she\u2019s probably going to hit a winner,\u201d Mouratoglou said.\n\nCoco Gauff will need to improve her serve.

At age 10, Gauff was invited to the Mouratoglou Academy in Paris for a week.\n\n\u201cShe was amazing,\u201d said Mouratoglou, who has worked with Gauff at times for five years. \u201cI met a 10-year-old kid, incredibly driven, and who really believed in herself.\u201d\n\nNow the question is, how aggressively should she charge at the future. While some wonder if Gauff\u2019s ascent is too much and too early, Tracy Austin\u2014who reached the quarterfinals of her first major at 14 but then suffered injuries\u2014said Gauff is ready to be a top pro.\n\n\u2018\u201cThere\u2019s nothing left for her in the juniors,\u201d Austin said. \u201cThere are some people you just can\u2019t slow down and you have to continue to challenge yourself.\u201d\n\nNow that her U.S. Open is over, Gauff will take a break and then return to practice. Because she is eligible for only a few tournaments before she turns 16 in March, Gauff likely will not appear at the China Open. She might find an exhibition event.\n\n\u201cShe can use that time to rest and get better and get ahead in school,\u201d Corey Gauff said. \u201cYou have to leave right at Christmas.\u201d", "description": "Now that Coco Gauff\u2019s tennis season is done, she will try to improve pretty much everything.
