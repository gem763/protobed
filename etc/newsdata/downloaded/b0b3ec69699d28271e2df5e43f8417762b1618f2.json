(Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)\n\nChina\u2019s rapidly evolving surveillance technologies have snared their share of fugitives in recent years.\n\nMost of these cases have involved facial recognition cameras, which can detect individual facial features regardless of glasses, hats or masks.\n\nThere were the 80-odd wanted suspects who were picked out of crowds of tens of thousands of fans at concerts by Jacky Cheung, a legendary Hong Kong pop star.\n\nIn April this year, a genius student wanted for killing his mother was caught after being on the lam for almost four years. He was nabbed within 10 minutes of entering Chongqing airport, local media outlet Southern Metropolis Daily reported.\n\nThere was even a grisly case in which a man was arrested for murdering his girlfriend after facial recognition software caught her face, not his, when he tried to apply for a loan using her visage.\n\nAnd just last month, police captured 25 wanted men, 19 drug users and five pickpockets using facial recognition technology at the Qingdao International Beer Festival, Asia\u2019s answer to Oktoberfest and an event that attracts several million revelers. An additional 32 people with a history of pickpocketing were denied entry to the festival when their facial features were captured at the security check.\n\nChina\u2019s facial recognition technology is now so advanced that it can positively identify 98.1 percent of human faces and within 0.8 seconds, according to the China Daily.\n\nBut the latest case of unconventional detective work comes from the eastern province of Jiangsu, where local police used their own faces, not their target\u2019s, to locate their man \u2014 specifically their noses. Call it olfactory recognition.\n\nJiangsu police had been looking for a man named Guo Bing, who was suspected of gang crimes, fraud and extortion and had been on the run in the city of Nantong since police there cracked down on gang-related activity in late May, local media reported Tuesday. The case was reported by Sixth Tone, an English language website devoted to Chinese news.\n\n[In China, facial recognition is sharp end of a drive for total surveillance]\n\nThe police used facial recognition to figure out which building in the city of Nantong their man was living in, but they didn\u2019t know the apartment.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult to tell which room he lives in because there are too many residents in the same building,\u201d Ge Lei, a local police detective, told the local television station, \u201cand the busy surroundings didn\u2019t allow us to do more.\u201d\n\nSo they put in 24-hour camera surveillance and spotted Guo going to a local market on Saturday afternoon and buying ingredients for hot pot, a Chinese specialty in which meat and vegetables are dipped into bubbling soup.\n\n\u201cWe saw him buying vegetables and hot pot soup base at a market in one afternoon,\u201d Ge said, \u201cso we guessed he was going to have hot pot that day.\u201d\n\nPolice narrowed down the search to the 7th floor of the apartment building, then started sniffing at each door.\n\nWhen they registered the unmistakable aroma of hot pot, they knew they had their man.\n\nTelevision footage of the bust showed police descending on the surprised and shirtless man \u2014 eating hot pot is a messy and sweaty business \u2014 and being hauled away.\n\n\n\nHe was caught red-faced, if not red-handed.\n\nWang Yuan contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nA suspect tried to blend in with 60,000 concertgoers.
