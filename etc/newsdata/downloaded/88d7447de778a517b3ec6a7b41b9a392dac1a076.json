China, one of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, is a case in point. By changing its economic model, shifting its sources of fuel, developing new transportation systems, and embracing eco-friendly urbanization, China has set an example of global leadership in sustainability strategy that the rest of the world needs to consider very carefully. In the rush to demonize China over trade, the West has missed this point altogether.\n\nIn the past 12 years, China's economic structure has shifted dramatically from excessive reliance on smokestack manufacturing industries to low-carbon services. Back in 2006, the so-called secondary sector of GDP\uff0dlargely manufacturing but also including construction and utility production\uff0daccounted for 48 percent of China's GDP, while the tertiary, or services, sector accounted for just 42 percent of GDP. By 2018, the shares had been reversed\uff0d41 percent of GDP for the secondary sector and 52 percent for services. For large economies, structural changes of this magnitude in such a short period are virtually unprecedented.\n\nStructural shift in economy exemplary\n\nThis shift was no accident. In March 2007, former premier Wen Jiabao warned of a Chinese economy that was becoming increasingly \"unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable\". That sparked a vigorous debate over sustainability risks that had a major impact on China's most recent five-year plans and reforms. The leadership concluded that the Chinese economy could no longer afford to stay the energy-and pollution-intensive course set by China's hyper-growth gambit in the early 1980s.\n\nConsistent with this dramatic structural transformation, China has been aggressive in shifting the mix of its fuel consumption away from carbon-intensive coal to oil, natural gas, hydropower, and renewables. Although coal accounted for 58 percent of China's total primary energy consumption in 2018\uff0dmore than three times the 18 percent share in the rest of the world\uff0dit was down sharply from 74 percent in 2006, the year before Wen's \"Four Uns\" first drew serious attention to sustainability.\n\nSignificantly, China is leading the world in embracing non-carbon renewables such as wind, solar and geothermal biomass. In 2018, China's renewables consumption was 38 percent more than that of the United States and triple that of Germany. While renewables still account for just 4 percent of China's total primary energy consumption, they have been growing by 25 percent annually over the past five years (including 29 percent growth in 2018). If China remains on this path, then renewables could hit 20 percent of China's total energy consumption by 2025\uff0da major breakthrough on the road to a cleaner, less carbon-intensive economy.\n\nTransportation model key to green strategy\n\nChina's rapidly changing transportation model is a third key component of its sustainability strategy. China has the world's largest high-speed rail network, the fastest-growing subway system, and is leading all efforts in the rush to embrace electric vehicles. According to World Bank estimates, China is expected to exceed 30,000 kilometers of installed high-speed rail by next year, up from more than 25,000 kilometers by 2017, and will add considerably more in the years ahead. This energy-efficient mode of long-distance connectivity stands in sharp contrast to the carbon-intensive transportation network created by the US interstate highway system in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nFinally, the urban environment\uff0dobviously critical to any sustainability challenge\uff0dis especially important in China where rapid urbanization will continue for three decades, with the urban share of its population likely to rise from nearly 60 percent at present to 80 percent by 2050. Yes, as in other countries, roads in China's major cities are severely congested. But China is doing something about it, boasting seven of the world's 12 longest subway networks.\n\nMoreover, China's electric vehicles market dwarfs those elsewhere, with sales of more than 500,000 electric vehicles in 2017, versus slightly less than 200,000 in the US and Europe. And China's electric vehicles lead is projected to widen considerably over the next decade.\n\nPlan to build 250 eco-cities\n\nChina also stands out for its focus on a new eco-city urban model, featuring low-energy construction materials, light mass transportation and well-planned \"green space\" urban pockets. The Xiong'an New Area in Hebei province is particularly noteworthy in this regard, as is the existing Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city and Hainan's recently announced plan to shift to all clean-energy vehicles.\n\nAccording to one recent estimate, China currently has plans to construct more than 250 eco-cities. As a relative latecomer to urbanization, China has the opportunity to rely on new models of city planning and energy efficiency that were not available to the first movers in the industrial world.\n\nIs all this enough to make a difference for China and the planet?\n\nThe good news is that China's share of global emissions has flattened out, albeit at a high level. China's share of global carbon dioxide emissions doubled from 14 percent in 2001 to 28 percent in 2011, but has not increased since. While China's CO2 emissions did rise by 2.2 percent in 2018, that was less than in the US(2.6 percent), Russia (4.2 percent), and India (7.0 percent) while falling well short of outright declines of 1.6 percent and 2 percent in Europe and Japan, respectively.\n\nChina sets a high bar for rest of the world\n\nStill, the good news in China is probably not good enough for a planet that many judge to be already in crisis. It's one thing to bend the curve and stabilize the emissions share. It's a different matter altogether to achieve the 20 percent reduction in the level of emissions as originally stipulated in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Nonetheless, by shifting away from carbon-intensive manufacturing to low-energy services, and embracing electric vehicles, high-speed rail, and eco-friendly urbanization\uff0dand likely to stay the course on all these trends\uff0dChina is setting a high bar for the rest of the world.\n\nAmid the trade war launched by the US, China is winning the far more important battle for sustainability. To its credit, China is focusing on this battle at a point when its per capita output is barely more than one-third the level in the so-called advanced economies. A relatively poor country has made a conscious choice to shift its focus from quantitative to qualitative growth.\n\nWhat about the rest of us?\n\nThe writer, a faculty member at Yale University and former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, is also the author of Unbalanced: The Codependency of America and China.\n\nProject Syndicate", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/12/5da120e2a310cf3e97a0ca15.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
