The participation rate for ages 20 to 24 dropped from almost 80% to about 71%, where it\u2019s held steady since 2010, according to Brookings.\n\nThe plunge in fresh-faced workers will continue into 2028, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics projections. The labor force participation rate for the 16- to 24-year-old age group is projected to shrink 3.5% from 2018 to 2028, the agency said.\n\nAs a result, just over half of the young working population (51.7%) will be part of the workforce by 2028, it said. That\u2019s 14% drop from the rate in 1998, when almost 66% of the 16- to 24-year old demographic had a job or was looking for one.\n\nAnother factor pushing employment down for young people is that they\u2019re competing against older workers who are sticking around in the job market longer, in part because some can\u2019t afford to stop working.\n\nExperts have long seen fewer young adults jumping into the jobs markets. Other researchers have said even with decades-low unemployment rates, high school graduates looking for a job have worse odds than their counterparts from 2000. One reason is that high school now gears them for college education, rather than immediate entry into the jobs market, they say.\n\n\u201cLabor force participation for youth is not an unalloyed good, in that there is generally a trade-off between work and schooling,\u201d the Brookings Institution report said.\n\nEducation has its trade-offs too, now more than ever.\n\nAmericans currently have approximately $1.5 trillion in student loan debt hanging over their heads. Loans finance college studies, but repayments can be suffocating for many and foreclose plans for new houses, new kids and fledgling careers.\n\nThe Brookings study notes the time spent on education instead of work can have a good payoff. There\u2019s a caveat though.\n\n\u201cThis of course requires that the time spent on education be used in valuable ways, with students picking good post-secondary programs and schools improving skills and knowledge,\u201d researchers wrote.", "description": "Youth employment rates are expected to decline through the next 10 years, experts say.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ846_cashie_ZG_20190906114723.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
