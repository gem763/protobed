More than 250 people have been killed in this month's demonstrations in the capital Baghdad and several southern cities.\n\nThe ongoing turmoil has broken nearly two years of relative stability in Iraq, which has endured the 2003 United States-led invasion and protracted fighting, including against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS).\n\nThe overnight violence left at least 14 people dead and 865 others wounded, medical and security sources said.\n\nOne source told Al Jazeera the death toll on Tuesday stood at 20, while an Iraqi official raised the death toll to 18, reported AP. Three protesters also died in the southern city of Nassiriya from wounds sustained in earlier protests.\n\n\u201c they are firing live Ammunition \u201c #Karbala , the government quelled the protest in a very violent way, crimes were committed and unknown number of casualties so far. #Iraq pic.twitter.com/PEAJxFgVeu \u2014 Steven nabil (@thestevennabil) October 28, 2019\n\nAli al-Nashmi, an Iraqi academic at Al-Mustansiriya University, told Al Jazeera the demonstrations were unlikely to die down, leaving the government with little choice but to eventually step down.\n\n\"Iraqis' main demands are [for the government] to address the issue of corruption, to step down, and for a new election to be held,\" al-Nashmi said.\n\n'No to the curfew'\n\nIn Baghdad, anti-government demonstrators defied a curfew imposed by the authorities from midnight until 6am local time. Scores of protesters occupied central Tahrir Square while others tried to cross a bridge leading to the heavily fortified Green Zone, where government offices and the US embassy are based.\n\n191024072246529\n\n\"No to the curfew, we will remain here. The curfew is one of their [the government] filthy games,\" a young protester, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons, told Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to Dlawer Ala'aldeen, a Middle East expert and founder of Middle East Research Institute, the government's curfew declaration aims to keep protesters in their homes so demonstrations die down.\n\n\"The curfew is a method by the government to hurry out its plans by evacuating the main areas and squares from the demonstrators,\" Ala'aldeen told Al Jazeera.\n\nEarlier on Monday, at least two anti-government protesters were killed and more than 100 wounded in clashes with security forces in Baghdad as thousands of students joined the demonstration in defiance of a government order and tear gas fired by security forces.\n\nIraqi soldiers were seen beating high school students with batons in two Baghdad districts. A defence ministry statement condemned the incident and said the troops did not represent the army as a whole. It did not say if they would be punished.\n\nOngoing turmoil\n\nAn Iraqi government committee investigating the first wave demonstrations, which took place during the first week of October, found 149 civilians were killed because security forces used excessive force and live-fire to quell protests.\n\nIts report, which said more than 70 percent of the deaths were caused by shots to the head or chest, held senior military commanders responsible but stopped short of blaming the prime minister and other top officials, saying there had been no order to shoot.\n\nMeanwhile, Shia religious leader Moqtada al-Sadr on Monday called on Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi to announce early parliamentary elections overseen by the United Nations and without the participation of existing political parties.\n\nSadr's bloc, which came first in a 2018 election and helped bring the prime minister's fragile coalition government to power, said on Saturday it was going into opposition until the demands of protesters were met.\n\nOn Monday, Iraq's parliament voted to dissolve the provincial councils, cancel the extra privileges for top officials, and summon Abdel Mahdi for questioning.\n\nAbdel Mahdi has proposed a laundry list of reforms, including hiring drives, increased pensions, and promises to root out corruption.\n\nPresident Barham Saleh has also held discussions with the UN on electoral reform and amendments to the 2005 constitution, but the moves have not appeased protesters.\n\nIn solidarity with demonstrators, four MPs resigned late on Sunday.", "description": "At least 14 people killed and hundreds wounded in violent dispersal of anti-government demonstrators in holy city.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/29/d5a13bb5d0b146f1a49ec30496be03e6_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
