England captain Owen Farrell said: \"We knew we had to be in a radius behind them. we wanted to not just stand there and let them come at us.\n\n\"We wanted to be respectful but we didn\u2019t just want to stand in a flat line.\"\n\n(Image: World Rugby via Getty Images)\n\nOfficials could be seen asking players at both tips of the V to retreat, including Joe Marler, Billy Vunipola, Mark Wilson, Elliot Daly, Luke Cowan\u2011Dickie and Ben Youngs, but failed to succeed.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, England have been fined less than the \u00a32,500 France had to pay when they adopted a similar formation during the 2011 World Cup final.\n\nAlmost all of the French squad stood in advance of the halfway line on that occasion.\n\nWorld Rugby have stuck by their policy again, having initially brought in its \u201ccultural ritual protocol\u201d in 2007.\n\nThat came as a response to France's first response to the haka - which ended with players from both sides going nose-to-nose after the French formed a tricolour in red, white and blue T-shirts a matter of feet away from their counterparts.\n\n(Image: Pixel8000)\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, World Rugby said \u201cthe matter had been dealt with\u201d.\n\nThey themselves had posted an official video of the incident on YouTube, in the aftermath of Saturday's match, labelling it: \"England\u2019s incredible response to intense New Zealand haka.\"\n\nSpeaking after the game on Saturday, Mako Vunipola revealed: \u201cWe talked about it as a team but everything has to get past the boss.\n\n\u201cHe gave us the idea. We wanted to be respectful, but we wanted to also make sure that they understood that we would be ready for the fight.\n\n\u201cWe knew it would rile them up. It probably felt like we disrespected them, [but] we meant no offence by it. We just wanted to let them know that we were ready for the challenge ahead.\u201d", "description": "The Red Rose have been handed a four-figure fine and reprimanded after breaching World Rugby regulations", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "World Rugvia Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20740600.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_pxl_eng_nz_semi_haka_001JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
