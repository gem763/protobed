The voluntary contribution is not payable on recycled plastics, immediately making it a cheaper alternative feedstock.\n\nForrest notes there are \u201ca manageable\u201d 100 or so major plastic producers using resin from oil and gas companies. And he says he\u2019s contacted them in the early days of the rollout, although potential participants were not yet named.\n\nThe funds, collected at the resin-production level, will be reinvested into projects that accelerate the industry\u2019s transition toward a circular plastics economy as well as environmental remediation efforts.\n\nThe voluntary contribution for fossil fuel-based plastics would start at US$200 per metric ton, up to about $5,000 per metric ton for those plastics most difficult to recycle. As \u201cbad\u201d plastic that can be recycled becomes just as desirable, demand dominoes through the value chain and turns plastic waste into a cashable commodity, driving collection efforts.\n\n\u201cThe technology [to recreate polymer resin from existing plastic] already exists and it\u2019s scalable, it\u2019s just about reassigning value,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than copper.\u201d\n\nAnd yes, consumers presumably would shoulder some of the cost, but also keep plastic in the closed system. But, added Forrest, in the interview, it\u2019s about changing consumer minds to think of plastic as a commodity as well: \u201cIf you make a bag or a bottle half a cent or a cent more, it\u2019ll make you think about alternative carriers and recycle. Again, thinking commodity, not waste.\u201d\n\nThe initiative will also, Forrest believes, help alleviate poverty through job opportunities at landfills and recycling centers, particularly in South East Asia where the waste problem is at its worst.\n\nMinderoo Foundation O&G stands for the oil and gas industry, whose byproducts create new plastics. The \u2018Sea The Future\u2019 voluntary contribution is implemented and collected at the resin production level. The funds raised will be reinvested into projects that accelerate the industry\u2019s transition toward a circular plastics economy as well as environmental remediation efforts.\n\n\u201cIndustry, fully supported by governments and regulators, is the only sector that can drive the urgent, global shift needed to save our oceans from plastic waste,\u201d said Forrest, who with his wife Nicola Forrest, established Minderoo in 2001. \u201cWe have less than five years to make this happen.\u201d\n\nRelated: Slower economy undermines business efforts to go carbon free, but goal is still sustainability by 2030\n\nMost of the 350 million-plus metric tons of plastic produced every year enter the world\u2019s terrestrial and marine environments. And best estimates suggest that plastic costs humanity over US$2.2 trillion a year in environmental and social damage, an academic paper in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science says. Forrest, a candidate for a PhD in marine ecology, is one of the contributors.\n\nForrest\u2019s US$300 million commitment consists of $40 million in startup capital and $1 million per week for 260 weeks for a global organization that would independently audit the initiative and funds raised from it.\n\nForrest is worth US$7.4 billion today but he was once Australia\u2019s richest man, with his net worth peaking at $12.7 billion in June 2008 when shares of Fortescue, now the world\u2019s fourth-largest iron ore producer, hit an all-time high, according to Forbes.\n\nMinderoo Foundation A linear plastics economy, on the left, would become a circular plastic economy (right).\n\nDown the supply chain, there is buy-in, if with some caution for getting industry and government to align.\n\n\u201cAt Unilever we are committed to ending ocean plastic and we welcome cross-industry initiatives, like the Minderoo Foundation\u2019s, that is looking across the value chain to identify scalable solutions,\u201d said Alan Jope, the company\u2019s UL, +1.01% CEO. This will be achieved \u201conly by rethinking plastic \u2014 from design to collection \u2014 and recognizing it as a valuable resource which should be kept in the economy and out of the environment.\u201d\n\nMinderoo Foundation The value chain of plastics, starting with the oil and gas industry.\n\nBrian Smith, president and COO, at the Coca-Cola Company KO, +0.30% noted the bottler has had its own role to play in finding a solution to plastic waste. In 2018, in an effort to develop its own circular economy for its plastic packaging, Coke launched what it called the World Without Waste initiative.\n\n\u201cWe recognized that no one entity, government or stakeholder, can solve this issue alone, so we routinely work with organizations and agencies around the world to identify, develop and scale potential solutions,\u201d said Smith. \u201cOne such idea is the concept outlined by Minderoo Foundation which, with further development, has the potential to accelerate the realization of a circular economy and help arrest the flow of plastic into our environment. The proposal requires partnering with industry, governments, regulators and other key stakeholders to ensure that its implementation is respectful of and compliant with the various laws and regulations of each country.\u201d\n\nRead: Banks worth $47 trillion adopt UN-backed climate pact \u2014 but only 3 of the top 10\n\nThe initiative is announced on the same day that Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison addresses this week\u2019s United Nations summit, which has included a focus on the environment.
