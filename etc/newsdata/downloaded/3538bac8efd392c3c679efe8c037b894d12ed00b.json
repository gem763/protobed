Shortly before noon, the First Lady greeted local Boy Scouts, spending 30 seconds to a minute with each. Her latest goodwill mission is meant to draw attention to the wellness pillar of her child-friendly \u201cBe Best\u201d program. Last week she took that message to a more adult audience by ringing the starting bell at the New York Stock Exchange with the help of fourth graders from the United Nations International School.\n\nMore from WWD\n\nThe First Lady\u2019s 48-hour tour of Teton Country will include stops at two of the 380-plus units in the National Parks Service \u2014 Grand Teton and Yellowstone. While the Sept. 23 appearance on Wall Street called for business attire \u2014 a black cap-sleeved Prada dress \u2014 her journey into the great outdoors started with more relaxed looks. Trump touched down in Wyoming uncharacteristically casually dressed in a tan hooded down coat with a turtleneck, pants and lace-up low-heeled ankle boots, all in black. The First Lady\u2019s excursion this afternoon included rafting on the Snake River with a guide and a cadre of fourth graders. The flotilla had a bald eagle sighting, as reported by FLOTUS communications\u2019 staff to the pool reporter.\n\nBest of WWD\n\nSign up for WWD's Newsletter.
