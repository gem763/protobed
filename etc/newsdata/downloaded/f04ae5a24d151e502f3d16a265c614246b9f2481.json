Johnson Helped Build Hair-Care Empire, Then Sold It", "language": "en", "text": "After founding a company to make hair-straightening potions for blacks, George E. Johnson soon turned to his wife, Joan B. Johnson, for help. She kept the books, handled hiring and scheduled production of the original product, Ultra Wave.\n\nJohnson Products Co. became the biggest supplier of hair-care products for the African-American market and, in 1971, the first black-owned company listed on the American Stock Exchange. The Johnsons moved to a luxury home in the Chicago suburb of Glencoe, with a pool and tennis court, and had vacation homes in Paris and Jamaica. They were depicted in the press as a model of how African-Americans could own and operate big businesses.\n\nA divorce in 1989 spoiled the picture. As part of the settlement, Ms. Johnson gained control of the company. She sold it to Ivax Corp. for about $70 million in 1993. Her former husband was furious about the sale of what he called the family\u2019s crown jewel. The founder of a trade association for black health and beauty products called it a sad day for what had been a beacon of hope for the community.\n\nMs. Johnson, who died Sept. 6 at age 89, lived long enough for a different view to emerge. She and George Johnson remarried in the mid-1990s and stayed together for the rest of her life. Their oldest son, Eric G. Johnson, is the chief executive and owner of Baldwin Richardson Foods Co., a maker of food ingredients with annual sales of about $275 million.\n\nEric Johnson figures his mother\u2019s timing was excellent. She sold the company after a steep rise in its stock price, at a time when a trend toward more natural hairstyles threatened the long-term value.\n\nJoan Betty Henderson was born on Oct. 16, 1929, just in time for a stock-market collapse. Her father was a railroad porter. In high school, she met George Johnson. \u201cI always had a crush on her\u2014long before she knew it,\u201d he told the Chicago Tribune later.\n\nHe dropped out of high school and worked as a door-to-door salesman of cosmetics for Fuller Products. Later he got a job in the company\u2019s laboratory and learned to make lipstick and other beauty products.\n\nWorking on the side with a hair stylist, Mr. Johnson came up with an ointment containing lye and petroleum, designed to make it easier for barbers to straighten hair. When he tried to borrow $250 to start a company, a banker turned down his loan request as too risky. A few days later, Mr. Johnson went to another branch of the bank, said he needed $250 to take his family on vacation, got the loan and used it for his new business.\n\nJohnson Products first sold mainly to barbers, then branched out to women\u2019s hair stylists and the retail market. It sponsored the television dance program \u201cSoul Train.\u201d When Afro hairstyles became popular in the late 1960s, the company came out with Afro Sheen to groom the more natural look.\n\nBy 1976, the company had an estimated 80% of what was known as the hair-relaxer market. The next year, the Federal Trade Commission required Johnson Products and other makers of hair straighteners to put warning labels on their packaging about the dangers of using lye. Some rivals introduced products without lye and gained market share.\n\nMeanwhile, Revlon Inc. and other big companies began pitching more products to African-Americans.\n\nJohnson Products opened a factory in Nigeria in the late 1970s but quickly pulled out of that market after what Mr. Johnson called a \u201csomewhat disastrous\u201d experience. Around the same time, the company introduced the Black Tie line of cologne and other men\u2019s toiletries, aimed at all races. It flopped.\n\nFor much of the 1980s, Johnson Products was in the red, and the stock price tanked. Eric Johnson, the eldest son, served as CEO after his mother became the controlling shareholder and chairwoman. He cut costs and improved results, sparking a resurgence of the stock, but left the company for reasons that he said he still can\u2019t explain. He went into the food business on his own.\n\nWhen she sold the company in 1993, Ms. Johnson rejected the idea that she had an obligation to keep it in black ownership. That \u201cwas not even my objective,\u201d she told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cIt was a matter of doing good business. That\u2019s what I was concerned with. My shareholders are happy.\u201d\n\nMs. Johnson, who served as a trustee of Spelman College, is survived by her husband, a sister, four children, 10 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.\n\nWrite to James R.
