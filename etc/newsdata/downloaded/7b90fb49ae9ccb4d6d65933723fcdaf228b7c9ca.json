The episode also breaks down what\u2019s next for Apple stock and why the tech firm looks so strong heading into the holiday shopping season.\n\nApple joined Microsoft MSFT last week in the $1 trillion market cap club after it unveiled its upcoming offerings. The company\u2019s new iPhone 11s, which include the 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, and iPhone 11, come in at slightly lower price points than some might have expected. The new smartphones feature some solid and standard upgrades, with the higher-priced phones\u2019 three-camera system promoted as the main selling point.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple is ready to launch its streaming TV service on November 1, for a cost of $4.99 per month. With that said, the company is offering a few enticing options for consumers in a crowded streaming TV market that includes Netflix NFLX, Amazon AMZN Prime, and soon enough Disney+ DIS and more. The service, which features some A-list Hollywood stars both in front of and behind the camera, is part of Apple\u2019s larger services push that includes Spotify SPOT challenger Apple Music and the soon-to-be-released video game platform, Apple Arcade.\n\nSome analysts, including Goldman Sachs GS, are worried that Apple TV+ will hurt Apple\u2019s bottom line. But investors and Wall Street should perhaps look ahead to Apple\u2019s Q4 fiscal 2019 and its vital holiday shopping period estimates because they show signs of strength from the Cupertino, California-based firm.\n\nIn the end, Apple stock looks strong amid current economic uncertainty for an array of reasons, especially compared to some of its fellow tech peers, like Facebook FB or Google GOOGL.\n\nAs a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.
