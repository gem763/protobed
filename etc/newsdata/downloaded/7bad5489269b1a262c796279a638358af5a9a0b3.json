For the moment you and I are not in danger of getting arrested by the NKVD,\" said Atwood, referring to the Soviet police force that carried out mass arrests and executions under dictator Josef Stalin.\n\n\"You think Gilead is bad or that the TV series is too violent? Look up the NKVD,\" Atwood added. \"It\u2019s important to have that perspective. People are saying Trump is re-creating Gilead. That\u2019s not true. If it were, we\u2019d not be having this conversation. He\u2019s not even a particularly Gileadean figure, more like a [Babylonian king] Nebuchadnezzar of the right. That guy went mad.\"\n\nELISABETH MOSS SAYS IT'S 'APT' TO COMPARE ANTI-ABORTION LAWS TO 'HANDMAID'S TALE'S' DYSTOPIAN SOCIETY\n\nWhen Lloyd responded by complaining about \"divisiveness being promoted\" in the U.S., Atwood told her to \"suck it up!\"\n\n\"Why are you so afraid?\" Atwood asked. \"No one is going to kill you right now. Anybody banging down your door? What you should be doing is figuring out who to vote for in the next election. Which candidate is going to take you the farthest he or she can from Gilead? Panic isn\u2019t helpful.\"\n\nSince the Hulu show based on Atwood's novel premiered in April 2017, liberals have repeatedly compared Republicans and their policies to those of the villains in the story. At the 2018 White House Correspondents' Dinner, for example, comedienne Michelle Wolf compared then-White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to Aunt Lydia, the brutal overseer of Gilead's female captives. A CNN documentary similarly drew comparisons to Atwood's story -- as did Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., when she spoke out against Alabama's restrictive abortion law.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA group of women also dressed up in the characteristic \"Handmaid's Tale\" uniform -- a red cloak with a white hood -- while protesting abortion restrictions and during Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings.\n\nBoth Atwood and Elisabeth Moss, who plays the main character in Hulu's adaptation, have suggested the story bore a resemblance to events in the United States.", "description": "Margaret Atwood, the author of the dystopian novel \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" blasted an interviewer\u00a0who tried to compare Atwood's\u00a0fictional land\u00a0of Gilead -- where women are property and forced to bear children -- to the United States under Trump.", "authors": ["Sam Dorman", "Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.
