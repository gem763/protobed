California will get 50 percent of the royalty fees incurred from the project.\n\nIn addition, the ruling authorizes potential oil and gas development in 14 areas previously litigated across Monterey and San Benito counties. Those areas would be subject to controlled surface use stipulations. The plan estimates that up to 32 new oil and gas development wells could be built on the federal lands during the plan's lifetime.\n\nBackground: No federal lease sales have occurred in California since 2013, when a court ruled BLM failed to consider the risks of fracking when it issued oil leases in Monterey and Fresno. The agency has since then conducted and filed new environmental impact studies on drilling in the area.\n\nWhat's next?

The President is finally telling the EPA that enough is enough, they must follow the law, and we appreciate that,\u201d Kevin Ross, president of the National Corn Growers Association, said in a statement.\n\nSen.

Joni Ernst: 'Whistleblowers should be protected' MORE (R-Iowa) was among the lawmakers from corn-producing states who issued statements Friday praising the proposal.\n\nBut the oil industry appeared just as unhappy as farmers were elated. \u201cLet\u2019s not sugar coat it, ethanol mandates are being raised because a handful of corn-state senators have extorted it from the president using election year politics,\u201d LeAnn Johnson with the Small Refiners Coalition said in a statement.\n\nBoth the American Petroleum Institute (API), the lobby for the oil industry, and the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents oil refineries, called the proposal concerning, vowing to challenge the policy because \u201cit is by no means a win-win.\u201d\n\nRead more here.\n\nPERRY ON HIS MERRY WAY?
