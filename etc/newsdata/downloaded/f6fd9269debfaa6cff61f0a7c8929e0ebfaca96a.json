Look for gluten-free flour with xantham gum in it to set your cookies apart and give them a texture that's more true to a classic chocolate chip cookie.\n\nHow does xantham gum help?\n\nXantham gum helps make for a chewy cookie.\n\nDoes adding liquid help?\n\nAdding a tablespoon of water or milk will help this recipe since gluten-free flour is typically a bit more \"thirsty\" than all-purpose or cake flour.\n\nCan you tweak this recipe to make it vegan?\n\nYes! Swap out the butter for good quality, firm vegan butter. Make sure to check your chocolate too; most dark chocolates are vegan.\n\nAny alternative sugar suggestions?\n\nCoconut sugar can be used in place of brown sugar and will have a slight caramel taste to it.\n\nLorraine\u2019s Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies\n\nABC News\n\nMakes around 20 cookies\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 stick of butter\n\n1 tbsp of water\n\n1 cup of brown sugar\n\n1 egg\n\n2-3 tsp of vanilla extract\n\n1 and 3/4 gluten free flour (look for one with xanthan gum in it)\n\n1 tsp of baking soda\n\nPinch of salt\n\n1 plus 1/4 cup of chocolate chips\n\n\n\nDirections:\n\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees.\n\nMelt the butter in a pan then pour in to a bowl.
