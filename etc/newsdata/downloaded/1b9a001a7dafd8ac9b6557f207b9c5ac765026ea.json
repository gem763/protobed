Sign up here.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund warned that global economic risks have risen as central banks reduce borrowing costs and that stronger oversight is needed to ease threats to an already shaky expansion.\n\n\u201cWhile easier financial conditions have supported economic growth and helped contain downside risks to the outlook in the near term, they have also encouraged more financial risk-taking and a further buildup of financial vulnerabilities, putting medium-term growth at risk,\u201d the IMF said Wednesday in its latest Global Financial Stability Report.\n\nThe policy easing that has helped support global growth has also fueled a further increase of financial risks, and threats to global growth and financial stability remain \u201cfirmly skewed to the downside,\u201d the fund said. It added that policy makers \u201curgently need to take action to tackle financial vulnerabilities that could exacerbate the next economic downturn.\u201d\n\nThe latest warnings come a day after the fund said global growth is on pace for the weakest expansion since 2009, when the world economy shrank, as trade wars cloud the outlook. Those disputes have whipsawed global markets and weighed on business sentiment, though central bank easing has helped alleviate concerns about a deeper economic slowdown, the report said.\n\nThe fund said lower yields are spurring investors such as insurance companies and pension funds \u201cto invest in riskier and less liquid securities\u201d and that pricing in financial markets signals interest rates will remain lower for longer than anticipated at the start of this year. About $15 trillion of debt worldwide has negative yields, it said.\n\n\u201cVulnerabilities have continued to intensify, putting growth at risk,\u201d Tobias Adrian, director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department, told reporters at a briefing on Wednesday, adding that policy makers need to prevent a rollback of regulatory reforms.\n\nWhile there\u2019s been significant progress on banking regulations, capital standards and liquidity levels since the crisis, trade policy is a new threat for stability, he said.\n\nTrade tensions have fueled pessimism in markets, creating uncertainty and repeatedly causing \u201cdownside risks,\u201d Adrian said. \u201cSo we urge policy makers around the world to work together to resolve those trade tensions.\u201d\n\nOfficials emphasized that companies are taking on more debt and their ability to service that debt is deteriorating.\n\n\u201cThere are quite a few weak non-financial firms in these economies that are still able to roll over debt and continue to accumulate debt because of very low interest rates\u201d Anna Ilyina, a division chief in the Monetary and Capital Markets Department, told reporters at the briefing.\n\n\u2018Under Pressure\u2019\n\n\u201cThe concern is that in an economic downturn these firms may come under pressure and may experience difficulty servicing the debt, and they have to deleverage, and when they do they cut back on investment and employment and that exacerbates the recession,\u201d she said.\n\nThe report said risks in China remain elevated due to high debt levels for investment vehicles, and said the authorities taking over one regional bank this year and injecting capital into another underscore the risks to the financial system in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nVulnerability among non-bank institutions is elevated in 80% of nations with large financial sectors, a share similar to the depths of the global financial crisis, the fund said. In an economic slowdown scenario half as severe, corporate debt owed by firms unable to cover their interest payments with earnings could rise to $19 trillion, or nearly 40% of company debt in major economies.\n\n\u201cThe search for yield in a prolonged low-interest-rate environment has led to stretched valuations in risky asset markets around the globe, raising the possibility of sharp, sudden adjustments in financial conditions,\u201d the fund said. \u201cSuch sharp tightening could have significant macroeconomic implications, especially in countries with elevated financial vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nIMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath pointed to rising financial stability risks on Tuesday after releasing the World Economic Outlook.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.\u00a0Sign up here.\u00a0The International Monetary Fund warned that global economic risks have risen as central banks reduce borrowing costs and that stronger oversight is needed to ease threats to an already shaky", "authors": ["Jeff Kearns"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/H7_.bfYvHLStKz1abwcZsw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/b6c77e750f560e70fb1d47563a954501", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
