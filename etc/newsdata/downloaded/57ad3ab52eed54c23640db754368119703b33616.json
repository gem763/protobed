It was the work of teenagers, authorities say.", "language": "en", "text": "And then, almost as quickly as she could snap a photo, the 74-pound, 6-foot log came hurtling over the ledge. It fell more than 75 feet off the cliff, striking Schafer as she was engrossed in her work. The 44-year-old mother of four died at the scene.\n\nAD\n\nAt first, the Chillicothe, Ohio, photographer\u2019s death appeared to be a tragic freak accident \u2015 but it didn\u2019t take authorities long to realize that the log didn\u2019t fall on its own. And it was not an accident. The log, somehow, was thrown or pushed.\n\nAD\n\nNow, authorities say they know who did it: two teenage boys.\n\nThe two 16-year-old boys were arrested and charged with reckless homicide in Schafer\u2019s death last week after detectives received a tip about their involvement, the Hocking County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a Thursday statement. The teenagers, who are not being identified because of their ages, admitted their involvement in \u201cforcing the log over the cliff\u201d once questioned by authorities, Hocking County assistant prosecutor Jorden Meadows said.\n\nAD\n\nThe arrests come after weeks of authorities pleading with the perpetrators to come forward and witnesses to assist in the investigation. Announcing a $10,000 reward for information leading to conviction, Schafer\u2019s family begged for answers in her puzzling death.\n\nFamily of woman killed in Hocking Hills sharing details surrounding death WATCH LIVE: The family of the woman killed while taking senior pictures in Hocking Hills is sharing details surrounding her death. http://bit.ly/304uysn Posted by WSYX ABC 6 on Monday, September 16, 2019\n\n\u201cIt is shocking,\u201d Terressa Reep, a close friend and neighbor of Schafer\u2019s, told WYSX. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect a healthy vivacious 44-year-old to not come home from a day at the park.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSchafer, who also worked as a human resources professional at a pet-store operator, had started her own photography business several years ago, capturing everything from underwater photos to sports and school portraits. She and her husband of 21 years, Fritz, were raising four teenagers between the ages of 13 and 19 at the time of her death. Maddie, 16, had learned of her mother\u2019s fatal injury from classmates who called to tell her what happened at the park, Schafer\u2019s sister, Catherine Muth, told reporters at a news conference last month. The oldest, 19-year-old John, got the call from his father.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Is she OK?\u2019 And he was like, \u2018No, she\u2019s dead,\u2019\" John recounted in an interview with the Dayton Daily News. \u201cAfter that, I didn\u2019t really say anything or think at all. I just figured maybe I heard the wrong name on the call, or maybe I was just hearing it wrong.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 3, the day after the tragedy, investigators with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources informed the family that the log did not fall organically from the cliff at Old Man\u2019s Cave. It had somehow been \u201cdislodged,\u201d as John Schafer recounted to the Daily News. At the top of the ledge, investigators discovered the imprint of where the 74-pound log had been, realizing that there was no way the chunk of wood simply could have rolled out of place. Plus, witnesses at the state park that day could recall having seen a group of kids up there.\n\nAD\n\nBut for a while, no one came forward to identify them.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really need anything, just some answers,\u201d Fritz Schafer, the photographer\u2019s husband, told WLWT at the time. \u201cI just can\u2019t stop thinking about her.\u201d\n\nFinally, the essential tip came through.\n\nMeadows told the Parkersburg News and Sentinel in West Virginia on Saturday that a mother of a local high school student called the tip line to report that one of the teenage suspects sent a text message saying that \u201che had done something serious at the park with another kid.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the boys confessed, she said.\n\nThe Hocking County coroner, Dave Cumin, told the Logan Daily News that the teenagers are accused of attempting to \u201ccause panic or other harm\u201d in pushing the log off the cliff like \u201ca projectile.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSchafer\u2019s death is one of numerous incidents in which teenagers have allegedly thrown rocks or other objects over a ledge and killed or seriously injured a person. In October 2017, in a case that\u2019s still ongoing, five Michigan teens were accused of throwing a rock off an Interstate 75 overpass, striking a 32-year-old man on his way home from work as the rock crashed through the windshield. One teen, Kyle Anger, has already pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is awaiting sentencing.\n\nAD\n\nPeople have thrown concrete, bricks and paint and even a tripod over bridges, but in some of those cases, such as in the March case of a 33-year-old Texas mom killed by a rock dropped onto her car, the perpetrators were not found.\n\nIn Schafer\u2019s case, her sister, Muth, said that if there were one thing Schafer would have wanted, it would be to raise awareness, ensuring this could never happen to someone else\u2019s loved one again.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOne thing I know to be true is this: Victoria would simply want the result of all this to be increased safety and awareness at all parks; she\u2019d never have wanted to put these kids\u2019 lives \u2014 or any other person\u2019s life \u2014 in danger,\" her friends and family wrote on the page \u201cFriends of Victoria Schafer,\u201d which garnered more than 3,000 supporters since her death last month.\n\nOn Friday, John Schafer told the Daily News that if his mother\u2019s death was the result of a bad decision by two teenagers, he would attend their court hearings to urge the judge not to levy a punishment that would ruin their lives.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anybody that understands teenagers making mistakes, it\u2019s my mom and me,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was truly just some kids that didn\u2019t know any better or were just being stupid kids, and not anything more than that, I think my mom would understand.\"\n\nAD", "description": "Victoria Schafer was taking photographs at an Ohio state park when a log that fell from a cliff landed on her and killed her.", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/A7irXj2iygy4mZ1aJAl9P1IxRWQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PFFVFPGRX5CW5KZBA6PTE3UCHM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
