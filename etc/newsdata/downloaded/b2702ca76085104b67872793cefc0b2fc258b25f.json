It was an escape and a bit of refreshing camp, but it was still really bold storytelling.\n\n\u2018I think we\u2019d prefer to have an update than a reboot, a revival moving it forward. It\u2019s more than just nostalgia, it\u2019s about seeing what life is like now.\u2019\n\nFootballers\u2019 Wives ran for five series on ITV from 2002 to 2006.\n\nZoe Lucker portrayed iconic character Tanya, with Cristian Solimeno playing her husband Jason.\n\nOver the years the show saw some truly wild times televised to the nation, including extramarital and same-sex affairs, death by a champagne bottle and even a very problematic baby swap scandal.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
