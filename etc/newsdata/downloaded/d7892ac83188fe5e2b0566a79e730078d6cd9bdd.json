Chris Nineham, from Together Against Trump, said estimates of crowd sizes were made when the rally gathered in Whitehall to hear speeches.\n\nHe said at that point people were gathered in a rectangle on a stretch of road from Downing Street leading up to Trafalgar Square, which made it easier to estimate. Observers were sent into the crowd to count rows and columns of people.\n\n2 Were there more Trump fans than critics?\n\nAbsolutely not. There were small pockets of pro-Trump fans wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats and holding US flags, but these were vastly outnumbered by those opposed to the president, and there was no separate organised rally in support of Mr Trump.\n\nThe fact police were forced to lock a group of around 20 pro-Trump activists in a pub for their own safety suggests there were many more on the streets who were opposed to the president\u2019s visit.\n\nVideo and photo evidence supports the suggestion that Trump supporters did not attend in significant numbers.\n\nWeyman Bennett, from Unite Against Fascism, who was on the march, said he had been made aware by police of between 25 and 35 pro-Trump demonstrators.\n\nVideos shared by Trump fans apparently showing crowds in support of the president on Tuesday have also been debunked.\n\nResponding to Mr Trump's tweet, fan account The Trump Train posted a video of demonstrators chanting \"We want Trump\" in London. However, the video appeared to have been taken at a \"Free Tommy Robinson\" protest in June 2018, while the far-right activist was in jail for contempt of court.\n\nFootage of the same protest was widely shared on social media in December 2018 to falsely claim as evidence that French \"yellow vest\" demonstrators were also chanting \"We want Trump\", and the president himself endorsed the claim.\n\nIn December, Mr Trump tweeted: \"The Paris Agreement isn't working out so well for Paris. Protests and riots all over France ... Chanting 'We Want Trump!' Love France.\"\n\n3 Did the media ignore the Trump fans who were there, as the president suggested?\n\nAgain, no. The small number of Trump supporters in the crowd attracted a disproportionate amount of news coverage for their size, largely because of scuffles involving them and rival protesters that broke out along the route.\n\n4 Why would Trump claim \u2018big crowds\u2019 gathered to support him?\n\nFirstly, the president has a history of misrepresenting crowd sizes. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Mr Trump has claimed repeatedly that he had the largest inauguration crowd in history.\n\nFollowing comparisons to Barack Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration, Mr Trump was swift to denounce side-by-side photographs which showed Mr Obama\u2019s inauguration crowd against his own, claiming the photograph of his 2017 inauguration had been \u201ctaken early\u201d, before everyone had arrived.\n\n\u201cI had a massive amount of people here. They were showing pictures that were very unflattering, as unflattering -- from certain angles -- that were taken early and lots of other things. I'll show you a picture later if you\u2019d like of a massive crowd,\u201d he told ABC News at the time.\n\nMr Trump also has a history of making outlandish claims that are provably false \u2013 including ahead of this state visit, when he described Meghan Markle as \u201cnasty\u201d before insisting he had been misquoted.\n\nHe later tweeted that the comments had been \u201cmade up by the fake news media\u201d, who he said had \u201cgot caught cold\u201d.\n\nBut The Sun newspaper subsequently posted a recording and transcript of the interview, in which he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know that. What can I say? I didn\u2019t know that she was nasty.\"", "description": "Donald Trump has suggested \u201cbig crowds\u201d turned out to support him in London on Tuesday, while demonstrations held by opposition groups were \u201corganised flops\u201d.
