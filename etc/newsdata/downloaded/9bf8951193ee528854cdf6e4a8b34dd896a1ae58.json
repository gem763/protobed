REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nBelow are the key points from the offer:\n\nNORTHERN IRISH BACKSTOP REMOVED:\n\n\u201cOur proposed compromise removes the so-called \u201cbackstop\u201d in the previous Withdrawal Agreement,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nCOMMITMENT TO 1998 GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT\n\nThe 500-km (300-mile) land border between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland has become the sticking point in efforts to agree on the terms of an orderly British exit from the European Union.\n\nIreland says an invisible border is a key national interest as any checks or infrastructure on the frontier could undermine Northern Ireland\u2019s 1998 peace deal, known as the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nThe government says its new proposals are compatible with the agreement.\n\n\u201cOur proposal is centred on our commitment to find solutions which are compatible with the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement. This framework is the fundamental basis for governance in Northern Ireland and protecting it is the highest priority for all.\u201d\n\nALL-IRELAND REGULATORY ZONE\n\n\u201cIt provides for the potential creation of an all-island regulatory zone on the island of Ireland, covering all goods and agrifood.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis zone would eliminate all regulatory checks for trade in goods between Northern Ireland and Ireland by ensuring that good regulations in Northern Ireland are the same as those in the rest of the EU.\u201d\n\nCONSENT\n\n\u201cThis regulatory zone must depend on the consent of those affected by it. This is essential to the acceptability of arrangements under which part of the UK accepts the rules of a different political entity.\u201d\n\nUK CUSTOMS TERRITORY\n\nAfter the end of the transition Brexit period, Northern Ireland will be fully part of the UK customs territory, not the EU Customs Union.\n\nThe UK will leave the EU customs union at the end of the transition period.\n\n\u201cWe must do so whole and entire. Control of trade policy is fundamental to out future vision.\u201d", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled what he said would be his final offer to the European Union for an amended Brexit deal, warning that if the proposals are not accepted Britain will leave the bloc at the end of the month without a divorce deal.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436275332&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9115T"}
