But investors are already looking ahead to Apple (AAPL) earnings due Wednesday night.\n\nAMD stock edged lower in volatile trade after hours. Inphi stock and Maxim stock jumped. Lattice Semiconductor rose slightly. The semiconductor sector has been the hottest tech sector in the stock market rally over the past few months. All four chipmakers reporting late Tuesday closed near buy points.\n\nApple stock edged higher late, but after suffering its biggest daily decline since Aug. 23.\n\nDow Jones Futures Today\n\nDow Jones futures were 0.1% above fair value. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were little changed. Remember that overnight action in Dow futures, AMD stock and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.\n\nCurrent Stock Market Rally\n\nThe current stock market rally hit resistance near all-time highs Tuesday, especially techs. The \"phase one\" partial China trade deal may not be finished in time for President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping to sign it at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile next month, Reuters reported, citing a U.S. official.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 index each fell 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite lost 0.6%.\n\nApple stock fell 2.3% on Tuesday. Google stock sank 2.2%, back below a buy point, after a big earnings miss late Monday. AMD stock closed down nearly 2%. Apple stock and AMD stock are among the many companies with big China exposure.\n\nAmong the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) dipped 0.1%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) fell 0.4%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) sank 0.7%.\n\nStock Market Rally Resistance Again\n\nThe Dow Jones today is still just a little more than 1% from all-time highs, while the Nasdaq is within 1%.\n\nIt's no coincidence that the stock market rally has revived with more upbeat China trade news. On the flip side, the China trade war has been a primary or contributing factor to several stock market tops since early last year.\n\nRegardless of the specific catalyst, there's no denying that stock market rallies have run into trouble after hitting new highs over the past year. The S&P 500 index is only slightly above its January 2018 and October 2018 peaks.\n\nAMD Earnings\n\nAMD earnings rose 38.5% to 18 cents as revenue rose 9% to $1.801 billion. That ended two quarters of declining profit and sales. Analysts expected AMD earnings of 18 cents a share and revenue of $1.828 billion. In addition to light Q3 revenue, AMD guided light on Q4 sales.\n\nAMD stock was up and down in late trade, sinking 1.1%. Shares closed down 2% to 33.03. AMD stock is working on a 35.65 buy point from a cup base.\n\nOther Chip Earnings\n\nInphi earnings: Inphi earnings rose 50% to 45 cents a share. Revenue grew 21% to $94.23 million. Both cleared estimates. Inphi stock popped 11% to 65.75. That would push Inphi stock almost all the way to a 66.66 buy point from a flat base.\n\nLattice Semiconductor earnings: Lattice Semiconductor earnings climbed 55% to 17 cents a share as sales rose 2% to $103.47 million, both beating. But the chipmaker guided low on revenue. Lattice Semiconductor stock fell 0.4% in late trading. Shares closed down 1.9% to 18.82. Lattice Semiconductor stock is in a consolidation with a 21.68 buy point, but below its 50-day line.\n\nMaxim earnings: Maxim earnings fell 31% to 52 cents a share as revenue sank 16.5% to $533 million. Both beat views. Maxim guided in line for fiscal Q2. Maxim stock rose 6.7% late. Shares closed up 1.2% to 58.66. Maxim stock is in the midst of a consolidation with a 65.83 buy point.\n\nApple Earnings\n\nAnalysts expect Apple earnings to fall 2% to $2.84 a share, with revenue edging down 0.7% to $62.45 billion. That would be the third straight quarter of declining Apple earnings. But it wouldn't take a big beat to see higher Apple earnings and sales.\n\nInvestors will pay close attention to the Apple forecast for the key holiday season.\n\nOn Friday, Apple will launch its Apple TV+ streaming service.\n\nApple stock fell 2.3% to 243.29, its biggest drop since Aug. 23. Shares had hit a record 249.75 intraday. Apple stock is extended from its 221.47 flat-base buy point.\n\nThe relative strength line for Apple stock is at record highs.\n\nPlease follow Ed Carson on Twitter at @IBD_ECarson for stock market updates and more.\n\nYOU ALSO MIGHT LIKE:\n\nThe Big Picture: Could This Be The No. 1 Surprise In Q4?\n\nStock Of The Day Nears Buy Zone From Bullish Base\n\nTwo Tech Titans Headline Wednesday's Earnings Reports\n\nBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock Lists\n\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\n\nGet The Best Of IBD In Your Inbox For Free", "description": "Dow Jones futures: The stock market rally stalled at highs Tuesday.
