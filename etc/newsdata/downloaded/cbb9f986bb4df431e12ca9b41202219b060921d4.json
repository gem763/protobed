REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo\n\nA voter asked Biden, one of the 10 Democratic White House hopefuls in a seven-hour series of climate town halls on CNN, why he was planning to attend a fundraiser to be held this week by Andrew Goldman, co-founder of Western LNG, a company looking to export liquefied natural gas.\n\nBiden said that Goldman, an adviser to him when he was a U.S. senator, was not a fossil-fuel executive.\n\n\u201cWhat I was told by my staff is that he did not have any responsibility relating to the company,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe was not on the board, he was not involved at all in the operation of the company at all.\u201d\n\nBiden said if it turned out that Goldman was involved in the operations, \u201cthen I will not in anyway accept his help.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president and all his Democratic rivals have agreed not to accept any donations from fossil-fuel companies or their employees.\n\nGoldman, who is listed among Western LNG\u2019s leadership on the company\u2019s website, did not immediately respond to a phone call and email seeking comment.\n\nThe exchange highlighted the political tensions involved in trying to lead the country off oil, coal and gas, a goal central to most of the plans offered by Democrats seeking their party\u2019s nomination to take on Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 presidential election.\n\nMany politicians from both parties say fossil fuels will be around for decades and that exports of LNG, which burns cleaner than coal or gas, can also help countries like India and China reduce deadly air pollution problems and provide Europe with alternatives to piped gas from Russia.\n\nThe forums pitted moderates like Biden against progressives such as Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and offered Democratic presidential candidates an opportunity in a crowded presidential field to stand out on an issue increasingly important to voters.\n\nTrump blasted the climate proposals of his Democratic challengers for the White House as they began showcasing their plans in the marathon round of televised town halls.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 destructive \u2018environmental\u2019 proposals will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump,\u201d Trump said in a tweet. Trump rejects mainstream climate science and has reversed Obama-era initiatives meant to curb emissions, promote alternatives to fossil fuels and join the world in fighting the crisis.\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE AS OPPORTUNITY\n\nOther Democratic candidates were split during the forums on whether or how to ban fracking of natural gas and oil, a technique that environmentalists say poses risks to air and water quality. Some environmentalists say fracking prolongs dependence on gas, slowing a transition to renewable energy like wind and solar power.\n\nAsked whether she would ban fracking, Senator Kamala Harris said yes. The California lawmaker said she would start by taking executive action to ban the practice on federal lands and seek congressional legislation to ban it elsewhere.\n\nJulian Castro, the housing secretary under former President Barack Obama, said he would not immediately ban fracking but supported local governments that did. Senator Amy Klobuchar called natural gas a \u201ctransitional fuel\u201d and said that while she would not ban fracking, she would review in her first 100 days in office every fracking permit that had been issued.\n\nConcerns about the environment have spiked as fires burn in the Arctic and Amazon, ice melts in Greenland and strong storms this year have flooded farms in Midwestern states. The forums featured updates on Hurricane Dorian, which closed in on South Carolina, after killing 20 people in the Bahamas.\n\nBiden is seeking to win back workers in industrial states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia who went for Trump in 2016. His $1.7 trillion plan supports carbon capture and sequestration, a technique to bury carbon and help utilities transition to cleaner sources of energy. The plan has been criticized by rivals as offering a middle ground that would not achieve goals to reduce emissions.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nSanders has taken a more confrontational approach. His $16.3 trillion plan does away with gasoline-powered cars and new nuclear power. It would also ban carbon capture and sequestration, even though U.N. climate scientists say that is integral to staving off the worst effects of climate change.\n\nThe town-hall format on climate emerged after the Democratic National Committee in August rejected debates on single issues like climate. The other Democrats who qualified for Wednesday\u2019s event were South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, U.S. Senator Cory Booker, former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.", "description": "U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden was called out during a climate change forum on Wednesday for planning to attend a fundraiser hosted by the co-founder of a natural gas export company, after he had pledged not to take fossil-fuel company money.", "authors": ["Timothy Gardner", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426161630&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830W4"}
