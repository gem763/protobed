Organized by the NIKKEI INC, and Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency (FSA), the 3-day event is going to be a mega \u2018fintech, blockchain, crypto and the future of finance\u2019 bonanza. Yes, you read that right!\n\nJapan\u2019s Financial Services Agency Loves Bitcoin and Lightning Network\n\nBitcoin bull and Morgan Creek Digital Co-Founder and Partner, Anthony Pompliano, was a part of today\u2019s show, delivering a keynote on \u201cDefining the Future of Money\u201d.\n\nApparently, after today\u2019s series of talks, speeches and fireside chats, Pomp had a chance to catch up with two key Financial Services Agency executives \u2013 the Commissioner Mr. Toshihide Endo and the Director of Fintech and Innovation, Mr. Jumpei Miwa.\n\nIt so happens that the financial regulator is stoked about Bitcoin and its associated scaling solution, the Lightning Network(LN). According to Mr. Pompliano, the FSA came out as a serious proponent of the world\u2019s top cryptocurrency as well as LN.\n\nJapan\u2019s Financial Services Agency is a big proponent of Bitcoin and Lightning Network. This is the Agency\u2019s Commissioner (top boss) on the left and the Director of Innovation on the right. The first country that embraces Bitcoin will have a significant advantage \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd pic.twitter.com/cgPkZcZCKQ \u2014 Pomp \ud83c\udf2a (@APompliano) September 3, 2019\n\nWhen asked to elaborate on FSA being a Bitcoin and Lightning Network proponent by Lightning Torch movement launcher \u2018hodlonaut\u2019, Pomp replied by saying:\n\nThey have fairly clear regulatory framework, they want to see Bitcoin/LN succeed, they specifically told me that they think open networks will win, and they are hoping to be a world leader in adopting both aspects of the tech\n\nJapanese Central Bank Already \u2018Promotes Bitcoin But With Controls\u2019\n\nAs reported by Nikkei Asian Review, a key Japanese central bank official was quoted saying, \u201cWe promote bitcoin but only with controls\u201d. Apart from this, the FSA is already at work monitoring cryptocurrency trading in the country in compliance with anti-money laundering prescriptions.\n\nAlso, it is pretty much evident from the nation\u2019s overall bitcoin and crypto trading scenario. As reported by Bitcoinist earlier, and per data published by Coinhills, the Yen is the second most widely traded national currency against Bitcoin.\n\nKey FSA Executive Joins The Financial Stability Board\n\nThe Financial Stability Board (FSB) has appointed Ryozo Himino, Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Japanese Financial Services Agency, as Chair of the FSB\u2019s Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC).\n\nAccording to the press statement, the FSA executive will serve a two-year term starting from September 2019.\n\nBut in spite of all the bullish news, reports have come in stating the sad state of cryptocurrency inquiries received by the Financial Services Agency. To be honest, that\u2019s not much of a brow-beater for the entire bitcoin and crypto-friendly situation in Japan, as with the rise in prices and overall market sentiment, the inquiries will rise too. For sure!\n\nDo you think Japan stands well placed to be the global leader in Bitcoin adoption?
