And that\u2019s not surprising, since it\u2019s a frequent theme of politicians and activists who present themselves as \u201cprogressives\u201d or who advocate for \u201cliberal\u201d causes.\n\nEven within the Catholic Church, social justice is assumed to be the province of \u201cliberal\u201d Catholics or \u201cpost-Vatican\u201d Catholics or \u201cDorothy Day\u201d Catholics.\n\nIn truth, concern for social justice extends far beyond those folks. It\u2019s at the heart of the Christian vision.\n\nThe Gospel of Luke (16th chapter) recounts Jesus\u2019 parable about a rich man who ignores the suffering of a poor beggar named Lazarus lying in his doorway. The rich man is well aware of the poor man\u2019s plight. He even knows him by name. But he steps right over him, going about his comfortable life with no apparent effort to help the unfortunate fellow (whom the Bible describes as ill and \u201ccovered with sores\u201d).\n\nMany people cite this parable as a condemnation of wealth \u2014 or in current economic terms, of \u201cincome disparity\u201d \u2014 and they present it as a call for social justice.\n\nThat\u2019s a misreading. While in other scriptural passages Jesus notes how hard it is for the rich to free themselves from worldliness in order to focus on salvation (his famous remark about a camel passing through the \u201ceye of a needle,\u201d for instance), Luke 16 isn\u2019t really a commentary on economics.\n\nThe sin of the rich man, as presented in the story, isn\u2019t his wealth. Rather, it\u2019s his lack of compassion for a fellow human being. In other words, this scene is a call to charity.\n\nIn truth, social justice permeates all church teaching. It\u2019s a basic element of moral theology. But, what does the church mean when it speaks of social justice?\n\nThere are three aspects of this concept \u2014 essentially, three types of justice involved.\n\nThe first is commutative justice. If you sell me something, I have an obligation to pay you for the merchandise at the agreed-upon price. If we make a contract, we both must live up to its terms. Failure to meet our obligations is unjust.\n\nThe second type of justice is a bit more complicated. This is called distributive justice, and it\u2019s often misunderstood. Distributive justice refers to creating what\u2019s often referred to as a \u201clevel playing field,\u201d that is, promoting the conditions whereby people have a fair chance to improve their situation in life or to attain individual or family goals. Distributive justice doesn\u2019t guarantee success in achieving one\u2019s desires, of course. Other factors come into play \u2014 most prominently among then, talent (which is to say, physical or intellectual capability) \u2014 and there\u2019s no guaranteeing an adequate supply of that. I might wish to play center field for the New York Yankees, but I can assure you that ain\u2019t gonna happen.\n\nThe third type of justice is what\u2019s called proprietary justice. This is justice that takes into account the human situations within which we make our life choices.\n\nConsider the plight of Jean Valjean, the protagonist in Victor Hugo\u2019s famous 1862 novel, \u201cLes Miserables\u201d (reinterpreted in several movie and TV versions, along with a Broadway musical of that title). In the story Jean Valjean steals a loaf of bread because his sister\u2019s children are starving, and he\u2019s pursued relentlessly by police inspector Javert. Does Jean Valjean have a right to steal the bread?\n\nProprietary justice is an expression of mercy that accounts for extenuating circumstances and reflects higher rights, in this case the right to life. Under the precepts of proprietary justice, Jean Valjean may have been broken the law, but this theft would be justified. His situation is such as to make him morally innocent.\n\nSocial justice, expressed in these three forms, is the moral basis for the \u201csocial safety net,\u201d our cluster of assistance programs \u2014 welfare, food stamps and such \u2014 designed to aid individuals and families that have fallen on hard times or are incapable of providing for themselves.\n\nSome types of assistance are offered by various levels of government, some by private organizations. Some are intended as short-term help to get people over their rough spots, some provide support indefinitely.\n\nAcknowledging that not all such efforts are wisely conceived, well administered or consistently effective, the church supports the general precept that we, as a society, have an obligation to assist the less fortunate. It holds that there is justification for funding public programs through taxes, and it certainly encourages both individual giving and organized charity.\n\nIn the government sphere, these considerations become political questions. In the area of private charity, they are important philanthropic judgments.\n\nAt the present time we\u2019re seeing increased interest in socialism, especially among young people steeped in the \u201cprogressive\u201d atmosphere that prevails on many college and university campuses. They are drawn to the idea of forcing wealthy people to bear a \u201cfairer share\u201d of society\u2019s costs.\n\nThey would see the rich man\u2019s callused disregard of Lazarus in Luke 16 as an argument for confiscating and redistributing wealth.\n\nThe problem is, however, that even if you believe rich people have a greater obligation to society, you very quickly run out of rich people.\n\nWhile their holdings may be disproportionate to their small numbers, the overwhelming portion of the nation\u2019s wealth is spread across the much larger middle class. And if you\u2019re going to institute a policy of wealth confiscation, the threshold at which you start confiscating drops very quickly to the level of ordinary wage earners and small business operators.\n\nPretty soon you\u2019re confiscating everything.\n\nJesus said, \u201cThe poor will always be with you.\u201d The church\u2019s job is to remind us that we have an obligation to care for those in need. And believe me, they are there. I live in Naples, Florida, one of the wealthiest communities in the country, and every day I see a long line in front of our local soup kitchen.\n\nWe must never forget our own obligations to our fellow human beings. It\u2019s up to each of us, individually, to ask: \u201cAm I stepping over Lazarus?\u201d\n\nA clear answer to that question is what makes for true social justice.\n\n\u2022 Michael P.
