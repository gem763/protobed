They'd been in commercial property for years but saw data centres as the next big thing and were eager to learn,\" Mr Yuile said.\n\nDavid Yuile is working with Tony Pitt after the pair met as investors in NextDC. Louie Douvis\n\n\"I'm not a funds person ... but when I sat down with Tony we were the perfect partners to do this because he had the funds management experience and I have all these contacts, experience and knowledge in digital infrastructure.\"\n\nThe new digital infrastructure fund will begin trading on the ASX on November 12, having completed an oversubscribed book build, raising $65 million.\n\nThe investors are yet to be named, but include 70 high net worth individuals, large infrastructure funds, which don't have the expertise in digital assets, and some institutional investors.\n\nThe fund has already invested in three data centres and within the next two to three years Mr Yuile intends to make another seven or eight investments.\n\nAs well as data centres, it will target fibre connectivity assets, and eventually 5G infrastructure projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving originally planned to raise $50 million, Mr Yuile was confident there was enough appetite for the fund to have $300 million under management in the next three years and $1 billion within five years.\n\n\"The reason we decided to list was two-fold. We got a lot of demand from existing 360 Capital fund owners ... then we recognised that there were very few listed opportunities to invest in digital infrastructure as a lot of the companies are private,\" Mr Yuile said.\n\n\"We're seeing so many projects and opportunities. [The industry] is still very early in the cycle.\"\n\nAs well as being instrumental in the sale of Metronode to Equinix, while chief executive of Nextgen Group, Mr Yuile led the sale of Nextgen Networks to Vocus in 2016 for $806 million.\n\nDuring his four years at the helm of Telecom New Zealand subsidiary AAPT, he attempted to turn around the struggling business, which resulted in its sale to TPG in 2014 for $450 million \u2013 above initial market expectations that the company would sell for $403 million.\n\nReflecting on his career, Mr Yuile said AAPT had been an \"amazingly challenging turnaround\", but was also one of the most rewarding jobs he's done.\n\nHe said the sale of AAPT's consumer business to iiNet in 2010 for $60 million had been one of his most difficult decisions, because it went against the \"heart and soul\" of the company.\n\nThough the deal had been a tough sell to its parent company Telecom NZ, (which ended up simultaneously selling out of its other Australian assets), Mr Yuile said it turned out to be the best thing the company did.\n\n\"I can put money into a company because I've been there, gone through it and understood what's gone wrong and right and if the cost structures are right or wrong,\" he said.\n\n\"Then to management teams we're investing in I also offer a sense of stability. We seek to make investments on a five to 10-year time horizon, so we're not getting in and getting out.\"", "description": "David Yuile has spent his career building up and selling digital infrastructure assets like data centres.
