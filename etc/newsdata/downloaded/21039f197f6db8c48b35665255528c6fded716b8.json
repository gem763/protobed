Jerry Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, issued a joint statement Thursday condemning the Department of Justice over reports it had opened a criminal investigation into the special counsel's Russia investigation.\n\nThe New York Times, citing two sources, reported Thursday that the Justice Department was shifting its review of the origins of the Russia investigation into a criminal inquiry. The review, said to be closely monitored by Attorney General William Barr, a Trump ally, is looking at whether the FBI's investigation into Russian election meddling and whether Trump or any of his associates had ties to it was influenced by anti-Trump sentiments.\n\nAccording to The Times, the move gives John Durham, the prosecutor leading the administrative review, the power to subpoena documents and witness testimony. It also creates a bizarre scenario in which the Justice Department is investigating itself.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal also reported that the review was being changed to a criminal investigation, citing a person familiar with the matter. It was unclear what prompted the change or whether any evidence of criminal conduct was found by Durham.\n\nadam schiff More\n\nJ.
