Tony Leon was doing his job and any allegation that he was 'behind' the persecution of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela is also a lie.\"\n\n\n\nGibson invited those \"interested in the truth, rather than nasty smears\" to read chapter 13, entitled \"Tangling with The Lady\" in Leon's 2008 book, On the Contrary.\n\n\n\n\"It tells the whole story of our efforts to ensure that the under-investigation of crimes and the under-prosecution that took place during the last years of the apartheid government were put right under the democratic government with thorough investigations and proper prosecution if sufficient evidence was uncovered.\n\n\n\n\"I was present at most of the interviews recounted and can personally vouch for the truth of what Tony wrote.\"\n\n\n\nHe added that it wasn't a clandestine matter.\n\n\n\n\"There was sensational publicity of Tony's speeches and writings, as well as the debates in Parliament. After all, Madikizela-Mandela was convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to four years in jail. The judge described her in that trial as 'an unblushing and unprincipled liar'. That sentence was replaced by a fine but the conviction was upheld by the appeal court,\" Gibson said.\n\n'The very embodiment of the political monster she attempted to slay'\n\n\"If Tony had not openly and publicly called for an investigation he would have been failing in his duty as leader of the opposition.\"\n\n\n\nHe said notwithstanding the current effort to create a better past, one needs to recall that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was unequivocal and condemnatory about Madikizela-Mandela on human rights violations.\n\n\n\n\"It is ridiculously unfair and wrong to attempt to convert Tony Leon into a villain. There are enough others around who could be seen as that,\" Gibson said.\n\n\n\n\"In Tony's book, On the Contrary, he sums up his view of Winnie, after referring to her as the 'charming, comforting, beguiling Mother of the Nation', [he] says: 'History, if accurately and unsentimentally written, should record Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's role properly. How she stood up, with singular charisma and courage, to apartheid; but also how, in so many ways, like the legend of Perseus, she became the very embodiment of the political monster she attempted to slay.'", "description": "DA veteran Douglas Gibson says calls for the reopening of a murder investigation against Winnie Madikizela-Mandela by former party leader Tony Leon were part of efforts remedy problems related to crime investigations and prosecution during apartheid.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/207/4fc6e8b869c540fcbf52ac02c73d2658.jpg", "published_at": "2018-04-16"}
