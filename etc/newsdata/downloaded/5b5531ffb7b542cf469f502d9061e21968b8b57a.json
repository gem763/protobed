Reporters are relying on readouts from the hourslong testimony from lawmakers, many of whom tend to hear what they want to hear from the witnesses. There are strategic reasons for the secrecy -- public hearings are often useless, and they don\u2019t want witnesses to alter their testimony based on what others say -- but it\u2019s left the public largely in the dark about the process to remove the 45th president of the United States.\n\n-- REPUBLICANS are not really defending what the president has done, but instead have relied on a series of process arguments to try to make the case that the impeachment is an illegitimate sham. Republican candidates on the trail and lawmakers in the Capitol have been unable or unwilling to answer whether the substance of what President DONALD TRUMP is accused of doing was OK. Anyone Republicans disagree with is a partisan hack with a bone to pick with Trump.\n\n-- THE WHITE HOUSE has decided to reject the legitimacy of the impeachment inquiry altogether. By refusing to cooperate, it has given Democrats ammunition to say the administration is blocking the legitimate functions of Congress.\n\n-- BOTH SIDES have been firing off letters, turning the impeachment era into, as Garrett Haake of NBC put it on the air, the \u201cthe golden age of letter writing.\u201d\n\nJOHN BRESNAHAN and MELANIE ZANONA: \u201cTrump faces twin crises as Congress returns\u201d: \u201c[A]s Democrats enter the fourth week of their impeachment inquiry, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other party leaders are wrestling with a number of key decisions, including when \u2014 and how \u2014 to take their case to the American public. So far, polls show support rising for Trump\u2019s impeachment, yet the public remains ambivalent about actually removing him from office. And the GOP base remains solidly behind Trump, as do Republican lawmakers.\u201d\n\nFWIW: CNN\u2019s MANU RAJU tweeted a video clip showing Rep. ADAM SCHIFF (D-Calif.) getting into a Capitol Police SUV outside the Capitol. It\u2019s pretty rare for a committee chair to have a protective detail. The clip\n\nGood Tuesday morning.

Bolton, then the national security adviser, that he told an aide to alert White House lawyers, House investigators were told on Monday.\n\n\u201cMr. Bolton got into a sharp exchange on July 10 with Gordon D. Sondland, the Trump donor turned ambassador to the European Union, who was working with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, to press Ukraine to investigate Democrats, according to testimony provided to the investigators.\n\n\u201cMr. Bolton instructed Fiona Hill, the senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs, to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council that Mr. Giuliani was working with Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, on a rogue operation with legal implications, Ms. Hill told the investigators, according to two people familiar with her closed-door testimony.\n\n\u201c\u2018I am not part of whatever drug deal Rudy and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u2019 Mr. Bolton, a Yale-trained lawyer, told Ms. Hill to tell White House lawyers, according to the testimony. It was not the first time Mr. Bolton expressed grave concerns to Ms. Hill about Mr. Giuliani. \u2018Giuliani\u2019s a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up,\u2019 Ms. Hill quoted Mr. Bolton saying during an earlier conversation.\u201d NYT\n\nANDREW DESIDERIO and KYLE CHENEY: \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s former top Russia aide told House impeachment investigators on Monday that she had at least two meetings with a National Security Council lawyer about Rudy Giuliani\u2019s efforts to convince Ukrainian officials to investigate the president\u2019s political rivals, according to a person who was in the room for the testimony.\u201d POLITICO\n\nON GORDON SONDLAND: \u201c\u2018Disruptive diplomat\u2019 Gordon Sondland, a key figure in Trump impeachment furor, long coveted ambassadorship,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Aaron Davis, Josh Dawsey, Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Michael Birnbaum: \u201cFor more than a decade, Sondland\u2019s home in Portland, Ore., had been a fundraising outpost for establishment Republicans, candidates he hoped would one day recognize his work corralling wealthy West Coast donors and reward him with a high-profile appointment \u2014 preferably, he told friends, an ambassadorship.\n\n\u201c[Jeb] Bush was the latest to disappoint. Sondland \u2018kept talking about it,\u2019 said a fellow Bush donor, adding that \u20182016 was not turning out remotely as we had expected.\u2019 To realize his goal, Sondland made a political about-face and backed Donald Trump, a candidate he once said was out of touch with his \u2018personal beliefs and values on so many levels.\u2019 After the election, Sondland contributed $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural.

Foreign-policy blunders often take months or years to reveal their damaging consequences, but the harm from President Trump\u2019s abrupt withdrawal of U.S. forces from northern Syria is playing out almost in real time.\u201d WSJ\n\nQUITE THE LEDE FROM NYT\u2019S DAVID SANGER: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s acquiescence to Turkey\u2019s move to send troops deep inside Syrian territory has in only one week\u2019s time turned into a bloody carnage, forced the abandonment of a successful five-year-long American project to keep the peace on a volatile border, and given an unanticipated victory to four American adversaries: Russia, Iran, the Syrian government and the Islamic State.\u201d NYT\n\nMORE NYT: \u201cAssad Forces Surge Forward in Syria as U.S. Pulls Back,\u201d by Ben Hubbard in Dohuk, Iraq, and Eric Schmitt: \u201cSyrian government forces streamed into the country\u2019s northeast on Monday, seizing towns where they had not set foot in years and filling a vacuum opened up by President Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the United States\u2019 Syrian Kurdish allies.\n\n\u201cLess than a week after Turkey launched an incursion into northern Syria with Mr. Trump\u2019s assent, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, considered a war criminal by the United States, has benefited handsomely, striking a deal with the United States\u2019 former allies to take the northern border and rapidly gaining territory without a fight.\n\n\u201cIn addition to Mr. al-Assad, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull American forces out of the way has also quickly redounded to the gain of Russia and Iran, as well as the Islamic State, as the retreat reconfigures battle lines and alliances in the eight-year war.\u201d NYT\n\n\u2026 AND TRUMP NOW WANTS A CEASE-FIRE: WAPO: \u201cTrump calls for cease-fire in northern Syria and imposes sanctions on Turkey,\u201d by Seung Min Kim and Karen DeYoung: \u201cThe Trump administration called on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to implement an immediate cease-fire in northern Syria and imposed sanctions against Turkey on Monday in response to its military aggression, as the situation on the ground continued to deteriorate after President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. forces.\n\n\u201cVice President Pence announced that he and national security adviser Robert C. O\u2019Brien would lead a delegation to Turkey in the \u2018immediate future\u2019 in an effort to end the violence in the region that has increasingly become a political problem for Trump at home.\n\n\u201cPence said that Erdogan and Trump spoke by phone on Monday and that the president \u2018communicated to him very clearly that the United States of America wants Turkey to stop the invasion, to implement an immediate cease-fire and to begin to negotiate with Kurdish forces in Syria to bring an end to the violence.\u2019\u201d WaPo\n\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-S.C.) jumped back on with Trump on Monday, saying he was in on phone calls with \u201ckey leaders in this conflict.\u201d \u201cThe president\u2019s team has a plan and I intend to support them as strongly as possible, and to give them reasonable time and space to achieve our mutual goals.\u201d\n\nPELOSI said this of the president\u2019s plan to sanction Turkey: \u201cPresident Trump has unleashed an escalation of chaos and insecurity in Syria. His announcement of a package of sanctions against Turkey falls very short of reversing that humanitarian disaster.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump gave Turkey the green light to attack our Kurdish partners, betraying the thousands of fighters who gave their lives to keep the world safe from the barbarism of ISIS. His erratic decision-making is threatening lives, risking regional security and undermining America\u2019s credibility in the world.\u201d Pelosi noted that the House will vote on a bipartisan package to disapprove of Trump\u2019s decision this week. The Senate is also expected to vote on the joint resolution.\n\n-- A PRETTY STUNNING LATE-AFTERNOON STATEMENT\u2026 DEFENSE SECRETARY MARK ESPER: \u201cThis unacceptable incursion has also undermined the successful multinational \u2018Defeat ISIS\u2019 mission in Syria, and resulted in the release of many dangerous ISIS detainees.\u201d\n\nHOUSE DEMOCRATS want to be talking about drug prices.

The subject of the email was \u2018Counter-Disinformation Update,\u2019 and it was part of a regular series of communications by DNC Tech, the party\u2019s in-house group responsible for internal security and monitoring the spread of fake news about Democrats.\n\n\u201cPOLITICO obtained the full archive of DNC\u2019s Tech\u2019s missives to the presidential campaigns.

His son, Hunter Biden, said he would step down from his role with a Chinese investment firm, and sat for his first television interview of the campaign.\n\n\u201cAnd in Iowa, the elder Mr. Biden delivered a fist-pounding diatribe against President Trump, casting him as the embodiment of public corruption. Altogether, it has added up to the most assertive attempt by Mr. Biden and his camp to extinguish questions about his son\u2019s business activities since Mr. Trump began raising them as a campaign issue, often in false or exaggerated terms.\n\n\u201cWhat remains to be seen is whether Mr. Biden can put those issues to rest on a far bigger stage \u2014 at the CNN/New York Times Democratic primary debate in central Ohio on Tuesday night.\u201d NYT\n\n-- BIDEN ALLY ED RENDELL: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have put Hunter on the air \u2026 The more you respond, the more you\u2019re playing into Donald Trump.\u201d The Daily Beast\n\n-- \u201cNew poll has Warren leading Biden ahead of next Democratic debate,\u201d by Evan Semones: \u201cA poll released the day before the Democrats' next presidential primary debate shows Sen.

In addition to being spouses, parents, children or friends of the servicemember or veteran, caregivers also step up and serve as doctors, nurses, therapists, financial planners, drivers and more. In some cases, they even set aside their own careers to care for those who served our nation. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 25% of caregivers spend more than 40 hours per week fulfilling this responsibility. And caregivers are often silent about their responsibilities. USAA recognizes the selflessness of these 5.5 million hidden heroes and backs efforts to connect them with resources and networks of support to help ease their load.
