It did not identify other hosts.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s repression campaign includes, among other abuses, the mass detention of more than one million individuals in internment camps since April 2017,\u201d the State Department said.\n\nU.N. experts and activists say at least 1 million Uighurs and members of other largely Muslim minority groups have been detained in camps in the remote Xinjiang region. Beijing describes complexes in Xinjiang as \u201cvocational training centers\u201d helping to stamp out extremism and give people new skills.\n\nWashington has been weighing how to confront China on the issue at the annual gathering of world leaders in New York this week. On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged all countries in the world to resist China\u2019s demands to repatriate Uighurs.\n\nPompeo said Beijing\u2019s campaign in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang was an \u201cattempt to erase its own citizens.\u201d\n\nPompeo and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence could also address China\u2019s treatment of the Uighurs at events this week, but a final decision on any U.S. remarks \u201cis expected to hinge on how the trade issue is going,\u201d an administration official said last week. China and the United States are fighting a trade war and are set to resume trade talks in October.", "description": "The United States will co-host an event on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on China's treatment of Muslim minorities including ethnic Uighurs, the U.S. State Department said in a statement on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
