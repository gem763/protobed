Within days of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court, a fascinating encounter took place. Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s father was approached by Ford\u2019s father at the golf club where they are both members.\n\nRalph Blasey, Ford\u2019s father, went out of his way to offer to Ed Kavanaugh his support of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court, according to multiple people familiar with the conversation that took place at Burning Tree Club in Bethesda, Maryland. \u201cI\u2019m glad Brett was confirmed,\u201d Ralph Blasey told Ed Kavanaugh, shaking his hand. Blasey added that the ordeal had been tough for both families.\n\nThe encounter immediately caused a stir at the close-knit private golf club as staff and members shared the news. The conversation between the two men echoed a letter that Blasey had previously sent to the elder Kavanaugh. Neither man returned requests for comment about the exchanges.", "description": "", "authors": ["Hemingway", "Thefederalist.Com Christine-Blasey-Fords-Father-Supported-Brett-Kavanaughs-Confirmation"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
