The celebrity chef may be turning 50-years-old next year, but she is not letting that number erode her confidence\n\nFlashback: In a stunning portrait, the former supermodel held her bare chest as she wore nothing but a pair of nude Spanx while in a hotel room as she got ready for the Emmy Awards in Hollywood a month ago\n\nThe caption for the throwback photo was bold as she said she felt good about the way she looked, as she should - the star is in incredible shape.\n\n'Feeling emotionally, physically & spiritually secure #emmys #tbt,' she wrote.\n\nLast month she had confessed that she had gained some weight from filming her TV show, but was fine with her new curves.\n\n'I haven't had time to diet so I'm about 146 lbs. right now, but I'm okay,' she told Us Weekly while at the Emmys. 'I'm lucky because I gain weight exponentially, like everywhere. So I don't care.'\n\nShe looks perfect: Last month she had confessed that she had gained some weight from filming her TV show, but was fine with her new curves. 'I haven't had time to diet so I'm about 146 lbs. right now, but I'm okay,' she told Us Weekly while at the Emmys\n\nIn this new image, Lakshmi turned her head to the side, showing her profile.\n\nHer glam was done with full makeup, her hair up and long diamond earrings by Kim Kardashian's favorite jeweler Lorraine Schwartz as she stood next to a floor lamp and black furniture.\n\nAt the Emmys she donned a floor-length light blue Christian Siriano gown.\n\n'I was just happy there was a dress this pretty that fit,' she said at the time.\n\nShe knows how to work a bikini: The cover girl often shared vacation photos to social media where she looks like a siren\n\n'And at the end of the day it's just about feeling comfortable. I am done trying to squeeze my bum into something that is too small.\n\n'I don't care \u2014 it shouldn't be about what I look like at this point in my career.'\n\nShe also spends a lot of time in a gym\n\nPadma was also candid about lingerie.\n\n'It's fine. I mean, I don't even have a bra on, so. I just think the female body is beautiful in its natural state,' she said.\n\n'I don't believe that we all have to do things to make it smooth and beautiful. At the end of the day, who cares?'\n\nEarlier she had said that always dieting is a bad message for her daughter Krishna Thea Lakshmi-Dell, aged nine.\n\n'She's noticed, and suddenly she's told me and others in our circle, \"I don't want to eat because I'm watching my figure,\" or, \"I weigh too much,\"' Lakshmi previously wrote in The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n'Her comments stopped me dead in my tracks. Her words scared me. Language matters. We send signals to our daughters every day. And I am her first touchstone of femininity.'\n\nShe also said that one day she hopes the red carpet isn\u2019t nearly as important as 'making sure my daughter doesn\u2019t measure her worth by her dress size.'", "description": "The celebrity chef may be turning 50-years-old next year, but she is not letting that number erode her confidence.
