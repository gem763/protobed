This summer he\u2019s releasing a huge book called David Lynch, Nudes that features over one hundred photographs of naked bodies. The title could seem to suggest an archive of naked pictures of the director\u2014maybe that\u2019s wishful thinking\u2014but it\u2019s actually a collection photos by Lynch, exploring the female form with his trademark alien eye.\n\n\n\nLynch has dabbled in painting and sculpture since he was a kid, but only picked up photography after he made Eraserhead. His approach to the women in Nudes seems to be similar to how he photographs factories in the documentary Lynch (One), searching for unique ways to use darkness to transform his subjects\u2019 shape.\n\n\u00a9 David Lynch\n\n\u201cI like to photograph naked women,\u201d said Lynch in a press release for the book. \u201cThe infinite variety of the human body is fascinating: it is amazing and magic to see how different women are.\u201d Many of the frames from his new tome are barely recognizable as bodies, while others highlight perspectives and angles that would be purged from any sane person\u2019s Instagram feed. In Lynch\u2019s hands, the sometimes grotesque view of the body seems natural and, as he says, amazing.\n\nLynch said in 2017 that a third season of Twin Peaks would take \u201ca few more years\u201d to make, and the man hasn\u2019t released a feature in over a decade. Projects like Nudes, alongside his documentary about making quinoa and the occasional Moby music video, are the only chance we\u2019ll have to get inside his twisted head for the foreseeable future.\n\nCheck out a sneak peek of David Lynch, Nudes below.\n\n\u00a9 David Lynch\n\n\u00a9 David Lynch\n\n\u00a9 David Lynch\n\n\u00a9 David Lynch\n\n\u00a9 David Lynch\n\n\u00a9 David Lynch\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nDavid Lynch, Nudes will be distributed by Thames and Hudson on June 12, 2018.\n\nFollow Beckett Mufson on Twitter.", "description": "A new book crosses his dark gaze with the human body.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5ad7ab3e1fb76b0007631622/lede/1524083664564-p120-121_David-Lynch-Nudes.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8348575367647059xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2018-04-19"}
