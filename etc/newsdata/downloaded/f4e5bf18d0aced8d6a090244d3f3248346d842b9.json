But Pompeo, Donald Trump\u2019s top diplomat, blamed the attacks squarely on Iran writing on Twitter that there was \u201cno evidence the attacks came from Yemen\u201d.\n\n\u201cAmid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nRelated: Major Saudi Arabia oil facilities hit by Houthi drone strikes\n\n\u201cTehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while [President Hassan] Rouhani and [foreign minister Javad] Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to a statement from the state-run oil producer Saudi Aramco, the attacks on the Abqaiq facility will cut the kingdom\u2019s production by about 5.7m barrels a day, more than half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s output. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s largest exporter of crude oil.\n\nThe US energy department said on Saturday it was ready to release oil from its strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) if needed.\n\n\u201cOil prices will jump on this attack, and if the disruption to Saudi production is prolonged, an SPR release \u2026 seems likely and sensible,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, founding director of the Centre on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York.\n\nIt is too early to know the extent of the damage to the processing plants and the Saudi supply chain that brings crude from oil fields to export facilities. The chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, said in a statement that the company would have more information within 48 hours, as it works to bring back the lost output.\n\nOn Saturday, before Pompeo\u2019s tweet, the White House said Trump had spoken to the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, \u201cto offer his support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s self-defense\u201d.\n\nThe attack comes as tensions have been rising between the Washington and Tehran, after Trump withdrew the US from a nuclear deal between world powers and the Islamic Republic.\n\nIran has restarted some uranium enrichment in violation of the 2015 nuclear accord and the US has imposed sanctions. But Trump has recently held the door open for nuclear talks to begin, perhaps on the sidelines of the United National general assembly in New York later this month. Pompeo said such talks could take place without any preconditions.\n\nAmid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply Mike Pompeo\n\nSaudi Arabia, a US ally, backs the Yemeni government in a brutal civil war which began in 2015. Iran backs the Houthis, who hold the capital, Sanaa, and other territory in the Arab world\u2019s poorest country.\n\nResponding to Pompeo\u2019s tweet on Saturday, the Democratic senator Chris Murphy, a member of the foreign relations committee, wrote: \u201cThis is such irresponsible simplification and it\u2019s how we get into dumb wars of choice.\n\n\u201cThe Saudis and Houthis are at war. The Saudis attack the Houthis and the Houthis attack back. Iran is backing the Houthis and has been a bad actor, but it\u2019s just not as simple as Houthis = Iran.\u201d\n\nThe Republican senator Lindsey Graham, a leading Trump ally, disagreed.\n\n\u201cIt is now time for the US to put on the table an attack on Iranian oil refineries if they continue their provocations or increase nuclear enrichment,\u201d the South Carolina senator said on Twitter.\n\nIt remained unclear if anyone was injured at the Abqaiq oil processing facility and the Khurais oil field, operated by Saudi Aramco. The attack early on Saturday sparked a huge fire, the kingdom\u2019s interior ministry said.\n\nThe US embassy in Riyadh said it was unaware of any injuries to Americans. Saudi Aramco employs a number of US citizens, some of whom live in guarded compounds near the site.\n\nA military spokesman for the Houthi rebels claimed responsibility, saying 10 drones had been deployed. The attack came after weeks of similar drone assaults on Saudi oil infrastructure, but none of the earlier strikes appeared to have caused such damage.\n\nThis is such irresponsible simplification and it\u2019s how we get into dumb wars of choice Chris Murphy\n\nThe war in Yemen has become the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, pushing the country to the brink of famine and killing more than 90,000 people, according to the US-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or Acled.\n\nStory continues", "description": "* US secretary of state says Tehran behind drone attack  * Trump speaks to Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin SalmanSmoke is seen following a fire at an Aramco factory in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia.
