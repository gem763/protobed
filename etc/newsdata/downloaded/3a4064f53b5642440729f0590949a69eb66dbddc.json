Singapore and Taipei each added 0.2 percent, while Sydney was marginally higher. There were also gains in Mumbai, Jakarta, Bangkok and Manila.\n\n- Johnson's tough week -\n\nHong Kong was marginally down with gains offset by profit-taking after last week's surge as well as ongoing worries about months-long protests in the city following another weekend of violence.\n\nIn early trade London rose 0.4 percent, Paris was flat and Frankfurt gained 0.3 percent.\n\nNeil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, warned: \"With central banks refilling the punch bowls, markets can shrug off the weakening economic data and put off the coming dawn for another hour. The party goes on for now, but it's looking increasingly precarious.\"\n\nTraders will turn their attention back to Westminster, where MPs are expected to pass a bill preventing Prime Minister Boris Johnson from taking Britain out of the European Union without a divorce agreement. Most economists have warned that a no-deal Brexit would hammer the economy.\n\nThe pound has enjoyed a rally since the new premier last week saw a number of his own party members help inflict a succession of parliamentary defeats that took control of the agenda out of his hands.\n\n\"Having failed to overturn the bill, fired... (nearly) 30 of his own MPs and failed to lure Labour (the opposition) into an early election, PM Johnson's next move will be to challenge the bill's legality in court while Parliament is in suspension,\" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.\n\n\"He may sell it as all part of his cunning Brexit plan; the rest of the world will likely view it as a desperate rear-guard action.\"\n\nJohnson's future has already been called into question less than two months after taking over at 10 Downing Street, and he suffered another blow at the weekend when one of his top cabinet ministers resigned in protest over his handling of the Brexit crisis.\n\nOn oil markets, both main contracts rose more than one percent on the Chinese monetary easing as well as hopes for US trade talks, while a meeting this week of top producers from OPEC and some non-members will be pored over for signs of further output cuts.\n\n- Key figures around 0720 GMT -\n\nTokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.6 percent at 21,318.42 (close)\n\nHong Kong - Hang Seng: FLAT at 26,681.40 (close)\n\nShanghai - Composite: UP 0.8 percent at 3,024.74 (close)\n\nLondon - FTSE 100: UP 0.4 percent at 7,312.49\n\nPound/dollar: UP at $1.2254 from $1.2246 at 2200 GMT\n\nEuro/pound: DOWN at 90.03 pence from 90.65 pence\n\nEuro/dollar: DOWN at $1.1032 from $1.1097\n\nDollar/yen: UP at 106.98 yen from 106.95 yen\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: UP 65 cents at $57.17 per barrel\n\nBrent North Sea crude: UP 65 cents at $62.19 per barrel\n\nNew York - Dow: UP 0.3 percent at 26,797.46 (close)", "description": "Most Asian markets started Monday on a positive note to build on last week's gains after China unveiled fresh stimulus measures and below-par US jobs data reinforced expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this month.
