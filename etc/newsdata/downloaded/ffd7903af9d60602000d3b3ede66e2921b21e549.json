Then the Pentagon fired the official doing that.", "language": "en", "text": "In December 2016, just a few weeks before moving into the White House, President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that once he was in office, \u201cbillions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases.\u201d\n\nPresidential candidates often campaign for or against defense spending, but Trump was perhaps the first to promise that his business acumen \u2014 an image bolstered by his bestselling book \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d \u2014 would enable him to shave billions of dollars off costly weapons, like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, estimated to top $1 trillion.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s critics were questioning whether he was actually capable of achieving big savings in the military budget, over at the Pentagon the man whose job it was to negotiate those weapons deals welcomed the president\u2019s attention to the issue.\n\n\u201cWhen you get somebody who is the president of the United States who understands precisely what you do for a living and understands how it\u2019s actually done, it becomes a pretty rewarding thing to do, especially when someone at the top is world-class himself in terms of negotiating,\u201d Shay Assad, the Pentagon\u2019s pricing director, told attendees at a conference held by McAleese and Credit Suisse in March 2017, just two months after Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nAssad had already built a reputation as the Department of Defense\u2019s toughest contract negotiator, having spent more than a decade battling defense companies on behalf of taxpayers, trying to get the prices down on skyrocketing weapons costs. Over the course of his career, he has been decorated with a panoply of awards from the Pentagon for his work, and praised for saving the government billions of dollars. A 2016 Politico profile described Assad, known for his dogged campaigns to force defense industry companies to justify their costs, as \u201cthe most hated man in the Pentagon.\u201d\n\nAssad\u2019s aggressive approach to contract negotiations, however, paid off. The Pentagon credited the career civil servant with bringing down the costs of the Apache helicopter, the C-17 transport plane and the F/A-18 fighter, saving taxpayers more than half a billion dollars. And that wasn\u2019t all: A former senior Pentagon official said Assad had over the span of his career \u201csaved the Department of Defense many billions of dollars.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s interest in negotiating better prices for the government made it seem like Assad\u2019s work would get White House attention.\n\nYet within two years of Trump\u2019s entrance into the White House, Assad would find himself removed from his job, and his efforts to save money and recover hundreds of millions of dollars in potentially fraudulent spending tabled.\n\nHis treatment, he contends, was the direct result of his attempts to save the Pentagon money and identify potential contract fraud, which brought him into conflict with the Pentagon\u2019s top weapons buyer. It was a conflict that ended dramatically, he says, when shortly after he emailed senior Pentagon officials about potential fraud, details about his travel records and his demotion were published in the press.\n\nAssad, who is now retired, says the issues he brought up involved potentially billions of dollars in waste and fraud, and still aren\u2019t being addressed. It\u2019s a claim that\u2019s backed up by multiple interviews conducted by Yahoo News with Assad and those who worked with him at the Pentagon, as well as by documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s senior leadership, many of whom came directly from the senior leadership of defense companies, are only making the problem worse, Assad argues. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of inappropriate pricing going on by major companies dealing with the Department of Defense, and there is an inherent conflict of interest when you have people coming in from industry,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the Pentagon, in response to detailed questions, objected broadly to the notion of any ethics violations, it declined to comment on Assad or his specific allegations, other than to argue over the scale of the potential contract fraud. Documents obtained by Yahoo News showed that the amount of overcharges identified to date by Pentagon auditors, who reviewed a relatively small sampling of contracts, is close to $900 million.\n\nAssad isn\u2019t alone in his concerns. Before his death, John McCain, the Republican senator from Arizona, railed against the defense industry\u2019s influence on the Pentagon and expressed concerns about the appointment of Patrick Shanahan, a Boeing executive, to the No. 2 spot in the Defense Department. More recently, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, expressed similar concerns when Mark Esper, a former Raytheon lobbyist, was nominated to the top job in the Pentagon.\n\nAssad has his own description of what\u2019s taking place inside the Defense Department. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the fox is in the chicken coop,\u201d he said.\n\nMore\n\nBy the time Donald Trump entered the White House in January 2017 with promises of dramatic savings in military contracts, Shay Assad had already spent more than a decade in government negotiating exactly that. He started his career working on contracts at Raytheon and moved to the Pentagon in 2004, where he quickly rose through the ranks, earning a reputation as one of the government\u2019s most hard-nosed negotiators.\n\nHe initially welcomed the Trump administration\u2019s stated commitment to cost savings, and in those early days the Pentagon appeared to be one of the more stable institutions in an administration buffeted by chaos. Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis was appointed as defense secretary, and Ellen Lord, previously the CEO of defense contractor Textron Systems, was brought in as the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment.\n\nWhen Lord joined the Pentagon in the summer of 2017 as the top weapons buyer, she appeared enthusiastic about Assad, who commuted between his home in Boston and his office in Washington. Lord even asked Assad to take on some additional roles at the Pentagon. \u201cShe asked me if I would take the acting position of the defense procurement and acquisition policy job as well as my own job,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI had to be in Washington five days a week.\u201d\n\nIn January 2018, Lord called Assad to her office to vent her frustration with the inconsistent performance of major defense firms. She said she wanted to find a way to get better results from defense companies \u2014 a message that was frequently repeated by the president. \u201cI said, \u2018Sure, you impact their cash flow, you\u2019ll get their attention to whatever you think is important,\u2019\u201d Assad recalled telling her. \u201cIf you tell companies their cash flow is dependent on it, they will respond.\u201d\n\nMore\n\nAssad\u2019s proposal had to do with what are known as progress payments, or periodic payments made to contractors in order to alleviate their operating costs. The Pentagon hadn\u2019t conducted a comprehensive assessment of its contract financing policies in three decades. Since that time, interest rates had plummeted to a historic low, which meant the Pentagon was perhaps fronting too much money to companies. It was an area, Assad believed, that was ripe for reform.\n\n\u201cWe have been mostly overpaying these companies in the program\u2019s payment,\u201d Assad said. \u201cBy overpayment, if you went back to the original rule in the mid-1980s, it was based on having an interest rate of about 12.5 percent.\u201d\n\nAt a meeting in late February 2018, Assad said he briefed his plan to reform progress payments to Lord as well as to Eric Chewning, head of the Pentagon\u2019s industrial policy office, and Kevin Fahey, assistant secretary for acquisition. Assad explained that his plan would tie progress payments to company performance, rather than stages of production process. The progress payment rate is set at 80 percent of total costs of delivering on a contract, and Assad wanted to reduce that to a base rate of 50 percent.\n\nAssad recalls that Lord approved of the proposal, and they agreed not to discuss it with industry until after Congress was briefed. Over the next few months, Assad held a host of briefings on the rule with representatives of various branches of the armed forces and the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget. There were, he said, no objections to the rule.\n\nBut by August, though the rule had been approved by the OMB, Assad said he still hadn\u2019t gotten approval from Lord, despite his multiple requests, to speak to Congress. Nonetheless, on Aug. 24, 2018, the proposed rule was published in the Federal Register.\n\nDefense companies were outraged. During a public meeting held on Sept. 14, 2018, industry representatives blasted the proposal, saying it would punish them for things over which they had no control. Those complaints also went to Congress, and the heads of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees wrote to then-Deputy Defense Secretary Shanahan, calling the rule \u201cfundamentally flawed.\u201d\n\nAccording to Assad, the congressional blowback was a result of Lord\u2019s failure to let him brief staff on the Hill about the potential to reduce costs for taxpayers and increase efficiency. On Sept. 24, a month after the rule was made public, Lord herself met with congressional staff, but it didn\u2019t go well. The next day, Lord met with Assad and two defense acquisition executives and announced the proposed rule would be withdrawn.\n\nOn Oct. 1, Shanahan, the deputy defense secretary, formally announced that the proposed rule would be rescinded. In letters to the congressional Armed Services Committees, Shanahan said the \u201cproposed amendments were prematurely released absent full coordination.\u201d Shanahan later told reporters that the proposed rule \u201cnever reached me. I don\u2019t know if it reached Ellen [Lord] either.\u201d\n\nMore\n\nAssad disagrees. \u201cThe only thing we didn\u2019t do is brief Congress,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was at this point that Assad said he was instructed by Lord\u2019s office to delete all the information he had concerning briefings on the proposed progress payment rule from a timeline he compiled for Shanahan\u2019s review. \u201cThat in itself was really troubling,\u201d Assad said. \u201cI mean, it was really ... people telling you, \u2018destroy information,\u2019 or \u2018eliminate information,\u2019 so that the secretary doesn\u2019t know what really happened ... I\u2019ve never had anybody ask me to do that in 45 years, or direct me to do it.\u201d\n\nWeeks later, Assad sat down with Lord for a performance evaluation in which, after years of exemplary reviews and service awards, she rated him as having a \u201cminimally acceptable performance,\u201d citing his \u201cleadership issues\u201d as the reason.\n\nA colleague of Assad\u2019s said he was unfairly blamed for the blowback, even though Lord had supported the proposal. \u201cWhen we first met in early 2018 with the senior leaders to talk about some of these ideas, I walked away with the impression that these were her ideas,\u201d said the former colleague of Assad\u2019s. \u201cWhether that\u2019s true at that stage or not, certainly when there was a significant pushback from industry, she didn't hesitate to throw Shay under the bus.\u201d\n\nAt the end of October, Assad was given an ultimatum: He could be demoted to a position within the Defense Contract Management Agency in Boston starting January 2019, or he would be terminated. Assad, who had been preparing for retirement, decided he would leave the Defense Department at the end of the year.\n\nMore\n\nIn the fall of 2018, Assad was nearing the end of his career in government, but with one final major task on his desk. The Pentagon\u2019s Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) had contacted him in October, wanting to discuss the key findings of work it had been doing at his request.\n\nOne preoccupation of Assad\u2019s over the past few years was an issue called \u201cdefective pricing.\u201d The terms comes from the Truth in Negotiations Act, or TINA, which requires companies to certify that accurate, current and complete cost or pricing data was disclosed to the government for negotiated procurements above a certain value (the current threshold is $2 million or more). In other words, are the costs that you claim are associated with the product you\u2019re selling truthful?\n\nWhether intentional or not, false certifications by contractors can cost taxpayers millions \u2014 and potentially billions \u2014 of dollars over time. Several years earlier, Assad had gone to Anita Bales, head of the auditing agency, to talk about what he describes as some \u201coutrageous stuff\u201d in Pentagon contracts.\n\nThe agency had not, as a result of resource constraints, been auditing contracts for defective pricing for a number of years. Assad wanted to change that. \u201cShay started lighting a fire under them in the teens, in 2012 and 2013,\u201d said a former colleague. \u201cHe really wanted them to start looking at defective pricing.\u201d\n\nMore\n\nDocuments released to Yahoo News from the DCAA confirmed that the agency saw a significant \u2014 and worsening \u2014 problem. The DCAA reported a cumulative $642 million backlog of unsettled defective pricing audits between 2014 and 2019, with recovery of money on a \u201csteep decline.\u201d Whereas in 2012 the documents showed a 94 percent recovery rate, by 2018 that had dropped to just 3 percent.\n\nSince 2012, however, reports of defective pricing have risen at a consistent rate, according to those documents, while resolution of those claims steadily decreased over the same period, likely because of \u201cnew contractor strategies.\u201d The DCAA mentioned factors including that companies were \u201cmore inclined to argue even when defense is weak,\u201d a strategy to \u201crun out the clock,\u201d and their belief that the Pentagon lacked legal expertise in defective pricing.\n\nNot all of the documents Yahoo News requested were released by the Pentagon, and according to Assad\u2019s recollection and notes, the auditing agency had in total, counting its headquarters and field offices, completed an analysis of approximately 250 contracts covering $95 billion of spending between 2008 and 2015. What it found, said Assad, was astounding: Within this relatively small sample, some $900 million of defective pricing findings were uncovered, meaning approximately 1 percent of the covered contracts. Among the biggest defective pricers, according to Assad, were Lockheed Martin, BAE, Boeing and Textron, Ellen Lord\u2019s former employer.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, the Department strongly disputes the claim that 1% of contract spending has been lost to defective pricing,\u201d Lt. Col. Mike Andrews, a Pentagon spokesperson, wrote in response to queries.\n\n\u201cDefective pricing dollars are a concern and will be pursued,\u201d Andrews continued. \u201cThe Defense Contract Audit Agency\u2019s (DCAA) data indicates a cumulative backlog in the amount of approximately $600M in potential defective pricing amounts, an amount that indicates the cited figure of 1% of contract spending is very much an inflated number.\u201d\n\nThe records released to Yahoo News demonstrate that the number cited by Andrews is selective, at best. While the backlog is $642 million, a chart released by the DCAA shows that cumulatively between 2012 and 2018, the auditing agency found nearly $870 million in defective pricing, a number that supports Assad\u2019s claim.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the cumulative amount of defective pricing that was a concern for auditors. Assad said that in December 2018, just weeks before he was set to retire, auditors informed him about what they called the \u201cgolden nugget,\u201d a case so egregious it warranted referral to criminal investigators.\n\nTextron had over a two-year period provided the Pentagon\u2019s auditors with thousands of pages of data, according to Assad. Drilling down into these reams of data, an auditor found a management review showing that for a specific item \u2014 what Assad would only identify as a \u201cwidget\u201d \u2014 the company misrepresented the production costs. Worse, of the Textron contracts examined by the auditors, 100 percent had defective pricing allegations.\n\nMore\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a word for that,\u201d Assad said. \u201cFraud.\u201d\n\nWhile documents released through the Freedom of Information Act confirm Assad\u2019s broader conclusions about the scope of defective pricing, the Defense Department redacted the names of specific companies involved, and declined to provide details in response to questions about the auditors\u2019 findings.\n\nInstead, the agency responded with a general statement confirming that the majority of the audits found defective pricing, but cautioned against making assumptions. \u201cOver the last three fiscal years, DCAA has issued 108 audit reports using a risk-based approach, 79 of which resulted in findings of defective pricing,\u201d wrote Christopher Sherwood, a Defense Department spokesperson. \u201cHowever, the contracts selected for [Truth in Negotiations] audits represent a very small percentage of total contracts DoD-wide, so DCAA\u2019s reported TiN audit results cannot be used as a basis for generalizations about the entire population of DoD contracts or trends at specific contractors.\u201d\n\nSherwood said that the claim of fraud requires \u201cproof of intent, and audit results do not determine intent.\u201d It would be up to investigators to determine fraud, he continued. (The Defense Criminal Investigative Service did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nTextron did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAnother person involved in reviewing the audits, who asked not to be named to prevent professional retaliation, agreed that fraud relies on proving intent, but said that in a number of cases they found \u201cextraordinarily large variances\u201d between what companies claimed and what auditors found in the records. \u201cIt would certainly appear that contractor officials were aware that they were providing data that wasn\u2019t accurate or wasn\u2019t complete,\u201d the person said.\n\nIn his final days before retirement, Assad felt strongly that something should be done. According to the recollections and notes he provided to Yahoo News, around noon on Dec. 21 he wrote to Lord. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a real problem. DCAA has just come to me. This is what they\u2019ve told me,\u201d he recalled telling her. \u201cI\u2019m recommending that a special unit be set up within the department. \u2026 It should not report to you.\u201d\n\nWhether Lord and her staff saw this as an attempt at retaliation from a soon-to-be-former employee is unclear. In response to detailed questions, Andrews, the Pentagon spokesperson, referred to Lord\u2019s public statement from earlier this year referring to her signed ethics agreement ensuring she would guarantee there was no conflict of interest with her prior Textron work. \u201cAny claim that Ms. Lord has been involved in any way with Textron Systems since her arrival is completely false,\u201d Andrews wrote.\n\nIn any case, Assad never got a response. But just hours after that message to Lord, he got more bad news: An article published by Defense One, an online publication, described Assad\u2019s removal from his job, claiming he had \u201cracked up thousands of dollars in travel costs.\u201d\n\nAssad, the article said, had a special commuting arrangement that cost the government $502,758 between 2012 and 2019. The information was provided to the publication by Andrews, an unusual if not unprecedented release of a civil servant\u2019s travel records. (Based on the numbers presented in the article, this would have worked out to a little more than $1,300 for airfare, hotel, and food and incidental expenses on each trip.)\n\nWhile the article conceded that \u201cneither Ash Carter, then the Pentagon\u2019s acquisition chief, nor his successor Frank Kendall objected to this arrangement,\u201d it noted that \u201cEllen Lord, the current undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment, has stopped paying for Assad\u2019s travel between Boston and Washington.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon had not only failed to defend the travel, which had been required of him, but implied it was the reason Assad was removed from his job.\n\nMore\n\n\u201cI was furious, because the reality of life is that I had been acting as the director of defense procurement and acquisition policy, as well as doing my own job, at the request of Ellen Lord,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t travel without her approval.\u201d\n\nAndrews, who serves as a spokesperson for Lord, declined to answer most questions about Assad\u2019s allegations on the record, but in a written statement said that after \u201ca reporter\u2019s claim that the Department had paid hundreds of thousands, if not millions, in travel and per diem for Mr. Assad, the Department released transportation expenses travel records to show transparency and accountability.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo News, Kevin Baron, executive editor of Defense One, wrote the publication \"started reporting about Shay Assad in the fall of 2018 after learning independently he was no longer the Pentagon\u2019s top negotiator and was in the process of being transferred.\"\n\nDefense One was aware Assad traveled frequently from Boston to Washington, D.C. and \"requested the cost of his taxpayer-funded travel expenses,\" Baron continued. \"That request was made formally in writing on Dec. 18, 2018. A Pentagon spokesman provided that information on the afternoon of Dec. 20, 2018. The story was posted the morning of Dec. 21, 2018.\"\n\nFor Assad, the information provided for the article was a clear attempt to discredit anything he might reveal in the future by making him look like a disgruntled employee. Former officials who had worked with him agreed with this contention, describing the Pentagon\u2019s efforts to plant a negative story about him as a baseless attack on a career civil servant.\n\n\u201cSomeone had to provide that information, and that kind of made it clear to me that this wasn\u2019t done by accident and somebody that had that knowledge inside the Pentagon was trying to make Shay look bad, and that was really disgusting, frankly,\u201d said a former colleague of Assad\u2019s, who asked not to be identified because it would jeopardize ongoing work with the Pentagon.\n\nThe former senior Pentagon official said Assad had become a \u201cscapegoat\u201d for the political backlash against the progressive payments scheme. Assad\u2019s commute from Boston was not a perk, the former senior official insisted, but a long-standing accommodation for someone the Defense Department wanted and needed in the job. \u201cIt was characterized as this huge expense, this unreasonable thing he was getting away with,\u201d the former official said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order of magnitude, he saved the Department of Defense billions of dollars ... over several years. A hundred thousand dollars for travel for him, it\u2019s insignificant compared to the money he was saving the DoD,\u201d the former official added.\n\nIf the need for a pricing director situated at the Pentagon was the reason for removing Assad from the job, then that explanation appears to be contradicted by the Defense Department\u2019s own actions. An email from earlier this year seen by Yahoo News inviting applications for Assad\u2019s former position as pricing director states that candidates for the job could choose to work from one of five locations outside the Washington, D.C., area, including Boston.\n\nMore\n\nShortly after Assad officially retired from the Defense Department, Rep. Stephen F. Lynch, D-Mass., spoke on the House floor, calling Assad \u201cthe most decorated contracting and pricing professional in the career civil service.\u201d\n\nThose who worked with him over the years offered similar praise for his efforts to save the government money. \u201cI have great respect for Shay and what he accomplished at DoD and for protecting the taxpayers\u2019 interest while also protecting the department\u2019s interest as well,\u201d said Tim DiNapoli, director of the Government Accountability Office\u2019s contracting and national security acquisitions team. \u201cThey\u2019re not mutually exclusive.\u201d\n\nAssad is still retired and living near Boston, though he sometimes travels to Washington to brief congressional oversight committees on defective pricing. He is still angry, however, about how he was treated at the Pentagon. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just that crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI never witnessed that in \u2014 whether it was a Democratic administration or a Republican administration \u2014 I never witnessed that kind of just wanton disregard or disdain for career civil service.\u201d\n\nHe is angrier, however, that the issues he worked on are still not being addressed.\n\nContractors overcharging the Pentagon did get a bit of attention earlier this year, when the Defense Department inspector general released a report concluding that TransDigm Group had sold parts to the military at profit margins of as much as 4,451 percent. In one case, the company charged $4,361 for a half-inch pin in a 2018 contract; the item should have cost just $46, according to the inspector general.\n\nThat inspector general report, however, dealt with only one company, and all but one of the contracts reviewed was below the TINA threshold, where firms have to provide certified cost data. In other words, almost all of those contracts were of lesser value than those that Assad has asked the Pentagon auditors to review. If TransDigm\u2019s transgressions were in the millions of dollars, the scope of defective pricing that Assad says auditors have identified is exponentially larger.\n\nMore\n\nDefective pricing on a percentage basis may be small \u2014 just 1 or 2 percent \u2014 but when the size of contracts is large, the money involved can be substantial. A congressional staffer who has been looking at the issue said the money lost to defective pricing was likely \u201cwell into the billions.\u201d That amount may be \u201ca drop in the bucket compared to the overall budget,\u201d but it\u2019s a large amount given the extent of the violations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a number that in my opinion would probably be pretty eye-opening for folks,\u201d the staffer said.\n\nIn the meantime, the savings on military contracts promised by the Trump administration appear elusive. In September, Bloomberg reported that the Pentagon, despite promising more than $1 billion in savings on the F-35, the costliest weapons program in history, would reap only about a third of that amount.\n\nAs for Assad\u2019s larger concerns about the conflict of interest inherent in having former industry executives in charge of overseeing contracts, that too remains unchanged. Ellen Lord continues to serve as the Pentagon\u2019s weapons czar, and in June, Esper, the former Raytheon top lobbyist, was confirmed as the new defense secretary. Sen. Warren voted against confirming Esper, who refused to recuse himself from dealing with contracts tied to his former employer.\n\nAs for Assad\u2019s old job, the Pentagon last week finally selected its permanent replacement for the head of pricing and contracting. The new director, according to Assad, will be based in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nAs for the money that Pentagon auditors found under Assad\u2019s watch that defense companies had overcharged, there is no evidence the Pentagon\u2019s leadership made any headway getting any of it returned. The Pentagon, in response to queries from Yahoo News, said there\u2019s a plan to establish a task force at the Defense Contract Management Agency, but provided no specific details on timing, or if it would report to Ellen Lord.\n\nThe lack of progress on recovering the money isn\u2019t because nobody knew.\n\nShortly before leaving his Pentagon post, Assad delivered a talk at a Bank of America conference, enjoining his colleagues to continue fighting fraud and waste within the Pentagon.\n\n\u201cI hear someone\u2019s looking for 1 to 5 billion,\u201d said Assad, referring to money President Trump was seeking for a border wall. \u201cI am pretty sure it is sitting over in the Defense Department as defective pricing and contract fraud, if someone has the courage to go get it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated, [Oct. 1, 2019, 3:17 pm]: This article has been updated to reflect a statement from Defense One.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Shay Assad was known as the Defense Department\u2019s toughest contract negotiator and was praised for saving the government billions.
