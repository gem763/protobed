She's worked so hard so it's amazing. Yeah she's doing really well.\"\n\nNow the actress has taken another short break away from filming following her split with Owen Warner.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\n(Image: Stephanie Davis/Instagram)\n\nAfter leaving the soap the first time, Steph went on to appear in Celebrity Big Brother , where she met boyfriend Jeremy McConnell.\n\nThe pair endured a turbulent on/off romance which was marred by allegations of violence, and left Jeremy behind bars on an assault conviction.\n\nShe also gave birth to the couple's child, son Caben Albi, raising him as a single mum.\n\nJeremy did not acknowledge he was the father until after the birth.\n\n(Image: DAILY MIRROR)\n\nKieron moved on to talk about how he and husband Carl are thinking of adopting in the future, and they want to change archaic laws about gay couples adopting.\n\nThe pair are already parents to twins, who were born in 2017 via surrogate.\n\nWhen asked if the pair are acting as a voice for other gay couples, Kieron responded: \"It's happened by chance, I think just cause we're young and we got married quite young, we've had kids quite young.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\n(Image: DAILY MIRROR)\n\n\"And lots of messages that we get are off people that are like, 'Where do you find a surrogate? What's the process, what happens?' It's just about us giving advice isn't it?\" he said as he turned to his husband.\n\nCarl then replied: \"It's nice to just help people in that situation aswell, and there's currently a petition going out with the government to try and change the laws on surrogacy.\n\n(Image: Alucard / SplashNews.com)\n\n\"You can find it online at the minute it's actually quite a nice thing to be able to see it.\"\n\nAdding to his earlier statement, Kieron admitted that he thinks the laws are still archaic.\n\nKieron shared: \"I think the laws are still quite - is archaic the right word? So they wanna update it and bring it into the 21st century with the help of other same sex couples that have gone through which I think's great.\"", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The Hollyoaks actor admitted he was impressed to see Steph back on the soap working hard and winning awards", "authors": ["Vicki Newman", "Image", "Wireimage", "Stephanie Davis Instagram", "Daily Mirror", "Alucard", "Splashnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20749091.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Pride-Of-Britain-Awards-2019-Red-Carpet-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
