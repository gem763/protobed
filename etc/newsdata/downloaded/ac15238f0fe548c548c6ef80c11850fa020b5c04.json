Reports note that at the beginning of last month, a group looking for Moujiang obtained information regarding his whereabouts thanks to a tip that led them to the mountain range behind the fugitive's hometown.\n\nPolice tried searching through the dense foliage but had trouble reaching certain parts of the mountain, so they decided to use a drone to scan the portions of mountain they couldn't access.\n\nAfter the drone combed over the area for around five hours, authorities spotted what looked like a blue tile, indicating that someone had set up a makeshift shelter in the area. Upon closer inspection, authorities noticed \"traces of activity and domestic garbage,\" leading them to investigate.\n\nPolice broke up into three groups to approach the cave in the hopes of apprehending Moujiang\u2014a task they accomplished after more than an hour of hiking the unsteady and steep terrain.\n\nMoujiang was found living in a 22-square-foot hovel filled with trash and had reportedly lost some ability to communicate since he had been in seclusion for so long. Moujiang has since sent back to prison.\n\nPhoto credit: Yongshan Police More\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The man lived in the wilderness for the past 17 years.", "authors": ["Daisy Hernandez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0KGKZnGPbwvzKFUo6BwQkQ--~B/aD02NDM7dz0xMjg2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_mechanics_642/c92e22f4aefaaa1d7a393b806115dfff"}
