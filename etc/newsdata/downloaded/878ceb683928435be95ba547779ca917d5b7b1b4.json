It shouldn\u2019t be a negotiable for anyone living in a well-functioning society, or even in California, which, despite its stupendous wealth and natural splendor, has blighted itself over the decades with misgovernance and misplaced priorities.\n\nThe same California that has been the seedbed of world-famous companies that make it possible for people to send widely viewed short missives of 280 characters or less, and share and like images of grumpy cats, isn\u2019t doing so well at keeping the lights on.\n\nThe same California that has boldly committed to transitioning to 50 percent renewable energy by 2025 \u2014 and 100 percent renewable energy by 2045 \u2014 can\u2019t manage its existing energy infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same California that has pushed its electricity rates to the highest in the contiguous United States through its mandates and regulations doesn\u2019t provide continuous access to that overpriced electricity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia governor Gavin Newsom, who has to try to evade responsibility for this debacle while presiding over it, blames \u201cdog-eat-dog capitalism\u201d for the state\u2019s current crisis. It sounds like he\u2019s referring to robber barons who have descended on the state to suck it dry of profits while burning it to the ground. But Newsom is talking about one of the most regulated industries in the state \u2014 namely California\u2019s energy utilities, which answer to the state\u2019s public utilities commission.\n\nThis is not exactly an Ayn Rand operation. The state could have, if it wanted, pushed the utilities to focus on the resilience and safety of its current infrastructure \u2014 implicated in some of the state\u2019s most fearsome recent fires \u2014 as a top priority. Instead, the commission forced costly renewable-energy initiatives on the utilities. Who cares about something as mundane as properly maintained power lines if something as supposedly epically important \u2014 and politically fashionable \u2014 as saving the planet is at stake?\n\nMeanwhile, California has had a decades-long aversion to properly clearing forests. The state\u2019s leaders have long been in thrall to the belief that cutting down trees is somehow an offense against nature, even though thinning helps create healthier forests. Biomass has been allowed to build up, and it becomes the kindling for catastrophic fires.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Chuck DeVore of the Texas Public Policy Foundation points out, a report of the Western Governors\u2019 Association warned of this effect more than a decade ago, noting that \u201cover time the fire-prone forests that were not thinned, burn in uncharacteristically destructive wildfires.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, then-governor Jerry Brown actually vetoed a bill that had unanimously passed the state legislature to promote the clearing of trees dangerously close to power lines. Brown\u2019s team says this legislation was no big deal, but one progressive watchdog called the bill \u201cneither insignificant or small.\u201d\n\nOn top of all this, more people live in remote areas susceptible to fires, in part because of the high cost of housing in more built-up areas.\n\nThere shouldn\u2019t be any doubt that California, susceptible to drought through its history and whipped by fierce, dry winds this time of year, is always going to have a fire problem. But there also shouldn\u2019t be any doubt that dealing with it this poorly is the result of a series of foolish, unrealistic policy choices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia\u2019s overriding goal should have been safe, cheap, and reliable power, a public good so basic that it\u2019s easy to take for granted. The state\u2019s focus on ideological fantasies has instead ensured it has none of the above.\n\n\u00a9 2019 by King Features Syndicate", "description": "More than 2 million people are going without power in Northern and Central California, in the latest and biggest of the intentional blackouts that are, astonishingly, California\u2019s best answer to the risk of runaway wildfires.", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "Andrew C.
