In the U.S., it delivered just 500,000 subscribers, 300,000 lower than analyst expectations.\n\nMacquarie analysts Tim Nollen and Jordan Boretz did not like what they heard from the company, downgrading its stock from \u201coutperform\u201d to \u201cneutral\u201d on concerns that the streaming competition is about to get really intense \u2014 Disney (NYSE:DIS), AT&T (NYSE:T), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are all introducing video streaming services over the next six months.\n\n\u201cWe think it will be hard for Netflix to grow much more in the US, and we suspect pricing power is limited,\u201d the analysts said in a note to investors.\n\nBy the end of November, investors will have a good idea of how much damage the competition will inflict on NFLX stock.\n\n\n\n\n\nTD Ameritrade (AMTD)\n\nstocks to sell TD Ameritrade (AMTD) More\n\nSource: Bandersnatch / Shutterstock.com\n\nBy now, most investors are likely aware that TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) announced Oct. 2 that it has eliminated all commissions for the online trade of U.S. stocks, options and exchange-traded funds.\n\n\u201cWe expect Fidelity and E*TRADE to react next and announce cuts to their own commission rates over the short-term, with both likely matching SCHW\u2019s/AMTD\u2019s zero rate,\u201d said Credit Suisse research analyst Craig Siegenthaler in a note to clients.\n\nShortly after TD Ameritrade\u2019s announcement, E-Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) followed suit. About a week later, Fidelity joined the broker price wars by introducing zero-commission trading.\n\nAll of these cuts come on the heels of Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) cutting commissions, a move that hit AMTD stock hard, sending it down by 25% on the news. It was the stock\u2019s worst day in 20 years.\n\nWith an over reliance on commission revenue, look for TD Ameritrade\u2019s stock to continue to feel the heat.", "description": "Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson suggested Oct. 14 that the mini-trade deal with China announced by Donald Trump the previous week is not going to help stocks reverse their course and move higher despite the two-day rally on the news. \"The bottom line is that without a significant", "authors": ["Will Ashworth"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lA1aM9QZ3OMaZ4b2GDpdew--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/investorplace_417/0bcc71015b8c17d30de95fed2a3ab755", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
