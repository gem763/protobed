The remote is pretty easy to use too.\n\nBecause this is a Roku TV, you'll get a Roku remote, which offers simple playback controls, quick-access buttons to your favorite streaming services, and more. It also works with Amazon's Alexa and the Google Assistant if you want to use voice control to operate the TV.\n\nThis TV is perfect as a secondary TV in a less frequently used space, or for those who have a smaller living room or bedroom and want a TV that won't take up too much space.
