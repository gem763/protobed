Gopinathan held the post of secretary of power, urban development and agriculture departments in the Dadra and Nagar Haveli administration.\n\nIn January, IAS officer Shah Faesal, who had been in the limelight since becoming the first Kashmiri to top the exam in 2009, resigned to protest the \"unabated\" killings in Kashmir and the marginalisation of Indian Muslims. He subsequently formed a political party, the J&K Peoples Movement.\n\n(With agency inputs)", "description": "Karnataka's Dakishna Kannada district Deputy Commissioner S Sasikanth Senthil resigned from the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) for personal reasons.
