Impeachment over this?\n\n\n\nWhat a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have lost their minds when it comes to President @realDonaldTrump. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 25, 2019\n\nGraham has encouraged the whistleblower, who sparked this controversy with a second-hand account of the call, to testify on Capitol Hill.\n\nIt tells me the Democrats think they are going to lose at the ballot box.\n\n\n\nThe only reason they are trying to impeach the president is because they don\u2019t believe they can beat him at the ballot box or they are trying to destroy him.https://t.co/LgLx7IJAQh \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 25, 2019\n\nRepublicans on the House side also aren't buying it.\n\nI've read the transcript and the Democrat spin was wrong... again\n\n\n\n- President Zelensky initiated the Giuliani convo and asked the WH to send him to Ukraine\n\n- ZERO discussion of foreign aid quid pro quo\n\n\n\nThat's it? THAT'S what Democrats are impeaching on?\n\n\n\nGive me a break. \u2014 Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) September 25, 2019\n\nTHIS is why @SpeakerPelosi launched impeachment? REALLY?\n\n\n\n-No quid pro quo\n\n-No discussion of foreign aid\n\n\n\nTo top it off, President Trump was asking Ukraine to look into serious and troubling issues regarding foreign interference in American elections. \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) September 25, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff is vowing to move forward while Speaker Nancy Pelosi claims she still hasn't seen the contents of the call.", "description": ".09/25/2019 19:22:04PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/196/6f9b8167-6265-45a3-94c0-89048a6fe959.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
