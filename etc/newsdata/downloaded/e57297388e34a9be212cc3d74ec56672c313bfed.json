They also vandalized shops and restaurants again, including a Starbucks coffee shop. Branches of the chain have been destroyed in recent weeks after the daughter of the local franchisee\u2019s owner spoke out against the movement at the UN.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam invoked an emergency law dating from the British colonial era to ban facemasks, becoming the first leader to do so since Hong Kong got its independence from Britain and received a special status from Beijing.\n\nAnyone violating the new regulations, which apply to all kinds of face coverings including paint, may be punished by up to a year in prison. The ban was welcomed by government supporters and Beijing.\n\nAs the decision was announced on Friday, the streets became the scene of fierce battles between police and protesters. The lawlessness continued well into the weekend after several subway stations and banks were vandalized, resulting in the suspension of the city\u2019s subway network, which normally handles more than four million trips a day. Many malls, shops and restaurants were also closed.\n\nAfter months of violent protests, Hong Kong residents are becoming more and more furious about unreliable access to basic things, such as subways and shops, even those that are known for always staying open. Some residents claim \u201cit\u2019s quite frustrating\u201d to see them closed and that it \u201creally affects daily life.\u201d\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
