Nothing wrong with that. So, if you are dating guys belonging to one of these zodiac signs, be ready to embrace old world romance:\n\n\n\nCancer\n\nCancerians are, broadly speaking, sensitive people. They seem to have a very soft romantic core in their hearts. Whatever you do, do not make a Cancerian rush into a relationship. They will take their own sweet time to open up. In all probability, they would find it hard to adjust to the fast-moving world of online dating.\n\n\n\nVirgo\n\nThey like to be slow and steady when it comes to dating and relationships. Generally speaking, people belonging to this sign tend to be extremely practical. So, they would like to weigh the pros and cons before saying 'aye' to a prospective date. In other words, they would like one-on-one interactions with their dates; they aren't likely to swipe right on an impulse.\n\n\n\nCapricorn\n\nGo-slow seems to be the motto for Capricorn guys as well. They are thorough romantics and love old fashioned ways - like meeting offline and talking to each other endlessly over phone. Of course, they wouldn't be totally closed to online dating, but they won't like to be bombarded with messages from people they hardly know.\n\nNext Story : Indian women are running up a storm!", "description": "Online dating may not be everyone's cup of tea.
