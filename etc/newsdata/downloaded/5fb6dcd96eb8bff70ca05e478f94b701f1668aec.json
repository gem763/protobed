In Jordan, women require permission from a male guardian to get married if they are under 30 and sex outside marriage is punishable by up to three years in prison.\n\nSimilar practices are prevalent across the Middle East, but Amnesty\u2019s 64-page report \u2013 which interviewed 121 people, including women held in Juwaideh prison, the country\u2019s main women\u2019s jail \u2013 shows they are also taking place in Jordan, billed as a relatively safe and friendly country in an otherwise volatile region.\n\nIn 2017, Jordan joined an increasing number of Arab countries in scrapping laws that allowed rapists to escape punishment provided they marry their victims.\n\nAmnesty said the country has in recent years carried out a number of reforms, including opening the Dar Amneh safety house for women at risk in July 2018, but the authorities continue to misuse the 1954 crime prevention law.\n\nImprisoning women for defying male authority amounts to \u201ca violation of their human rights\u201d, said the report.\n\nSubjecting women to \u201chumiliating\u201d virginity tests was akin to torture.\n\n\u201cThe biggest punishment of all is saved for women who become pregnant outside of marriage \u2013 the state sanctioned theft of their child,\u201d said the report.\n\nI got pregnant and tried to marry the man. But the marriage wasn\u2019t approved because I have no guardian Ola (not her real name), victim\n\nTestimonies provided by Amnesty showed those jailed were, in many cases, fleeing abusive environments.\n\nSawsan (not her real name) was jailed for more than a year simply for fleeing her abusive father, according to Amnesty. \u201cI was stopped on the street in Amman and the police asked me for my ID. I didn\u2019t have it, so they said I had to come to their station, but when I got there they found a warrant for my arrest because I was \u2018absent\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThe two police officers there beat me \u2026 I was taken to the governor\u2019s deputy \u2026 He said I would go to Juwaideh prison until my father bails me out.\u201d\n\nOla (not her real name) encountered problems after hospital staff called the police to report her for being pregnant outside marriage.\n\n\u201cI got pregnant and tried to marry the man. But the marriage wasn\u2019t approved because I have no guardian,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents are dead, and I just have younger sisters, no brothers \u2026 I went to hospital and gave birth. The hospital asked if I was married and I said: \u2018No\u2019, so then they called the police. That\u2019s how I ended up here.\u201d\n\nHeba Morayef, Amnesty\u2019s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said: \u201cTime has now come to end the detention and ill-treatment of women simply for disobeying their male guardian or transgressing gender norms.\n\n\u201cThe use of \u2018virginity tests\u2019 by the police in Jordan reinforces a discriminatory idea that male family members have a right to monitor and control women\u2019s sexuality. Such unlawful practices must end in all circumstances.\n\nJordan bans rapists from escaping justice by marrying victim Read more\n\n\u201cSadly, we have documented several cases of unmarried women who became pregnant as a result of rape, who were then imprisoned, forcibly separated from their child, or denied birth registration.\u201d\n\nThe office of the Jordanian prime minister told Amnesty that as many as 149 women are in prison for \u201cdifferent reasons\u201d, but insisted \u201cthere is no case where women have been apprehended for being absent from home without their guardian\u2019s permission, unless this is combined with a complaint about committing a crime or an offence\u201d.\n\nHanan (not her real name), a woman aged almost 20, was also jailed for fleeing an abusive home alongside her sister. \u201cEvery time we ran away, when we were arrested the police would take us to the hospital and my father would insist that they do the virginity tests on [us],\u201d she said. \u201cFamily Protection [police] made it very clear anyway, if our father asks us to do the test, we have to do it. It is his right.\u201d\n\nAt least 85 women have been held in administrative detention so far this year for sex outside marriage \u201cto ensure their protection\u201d, the prime minister\u2019s office said, claiming that the majority had been released.", "description": "Amnesty calls for end to detentions under male \u2018guardianship\u2019 system", "authors": ["Saeed Kamali Dehghan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cec1bad96ace3ca5293ae274ec2d41463c330dd/0_196_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=56866b7fe5b95ab276e7e5fda70f7482", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
