His claims are impossible to verify.\n\nBut he says he's considering remaining on R\u00e9union, where a local charity are looking after him", "description": "54-year-old Zbigniew Reket was heading for South Africa, where he intended to take up work, when his boat was severely damaged, leaving the sailor without navigation or communication systems.", "authors": ["Katy Dartford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/04/11/12/1000x563_story-49899dcd-16a9-5cae-b4cc-55d4e7e9625e_247115.jpg", "published_at": "2017-12-28"}
