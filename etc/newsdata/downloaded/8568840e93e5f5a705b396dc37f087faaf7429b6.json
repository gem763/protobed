You can find it in POLITICO's weekly print edition and online on Fridays.\n\nRevenge is a dish best served cold, so the old saying goes. But enough about the NATO canteen, what about the growing number of revenge theories being bandied about in Brussels and Paris these days!\n\nWas Sylvie Goulard rejected by MEPs as revenge for her pal Emmanuel Macron leading the campaign to stop Manfred Weber becoming Commission chief? Is France the only holdout against North Macedonia's EU membership because Macron wants revenge against his enemies in the European Council? Did Macron really describe French civil servants as the \u201cDeep State\u201d? It's like the plot to a (badly acted, low budget, daytime) suspense thriller.\n\nThe common denominator here does seem to be Macron. If this were a revenge movie \u2014 \"Gladiator,\" say \u2014 then the French president would be Russell Crowe's character: \"My name is Emmanuel Jean-Michel Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Macron, eighth president of the Fifth Republic of France, loyal servant to the man in the mirror, father to no one, husband to Brigitte \u2014 and I will have my vengeance, at this summit or the next.\"\n\nIf it seems Macron has an enemies list just like Richard Nixon did, that's because he does, and a copy just so happened to be sent to Declassified by a disgruntled Elysee staffer. Here's what it says...\n\nGet Guy Verhofstadt banned from Twitter.\n\nGive Marine Le Pen a cat (but make it a foreign one).\n\n\"Accidentally\" call Ursula von der Leyen \"Manfred\" whenever possible.\n\nCall opponents \"slackers\" and tell the unemployed to \"cross the street\" to look for work [this entry was crossed out on the list as he actually said those things].\n\nAsk Donald Trump why his children are lazy and feckless, not like that nice Hunter Biden.\n\nOf course, revenge works both ways. Here's an idea for getting back at the French president: Give Macron a chocolate model of himself and tell him he can't eat it.\n\nDOS AND DON'TS\n\nDO: Choose a PM with a different name\n\nOh good lord, there's two of them! Yes, Romania has chosen Ludovic Orban to be its next prime minister, because there's nothing EU leaders like more than dealing with someone with that surname (not having the diacritic isn't going to help matters).\n\nDON'T: Arrest a man dressed as broccoli\n\nThat's what London police did during the Extinction Rebellion protests. Broccoli man, who shouted \"give peas a chance\" as he was being detained, was almost certainly a member of the Greens.\n\nCAPTION COMPETITION\n\n'Bring your child to work day' wasn't a roaring success.\n\nCan you do better? Email pdallison@politico.eu or on Twitter @pdallison74\n\nLast week we gave you this photo.\n\nThanks for all the entries. Here\u2019s the best from our post bag (there\u2019s no prize except for the gift of laughter, which I think we can all agree is far more valuable than cash or booze).\n\n\"Boris told me it means 'I love you'\" by Mateo Bello\n\nPaul Dallison is POLITICO's slot news editor.", "description": "There\u2019s a list and everyone\u2019s on it.", "authors": ["Paul Dallison"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176501352-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
