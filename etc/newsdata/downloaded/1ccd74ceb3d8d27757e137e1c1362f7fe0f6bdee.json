Automatically, a colt is worth $30-$40 million minimum if it wins the Slipper, and if it has good breeding then $50 million.\n\n\u201cBut if a three-year-old colt can beat the best sprinters in the land then it must put his value up above that as the Golden Slipper is only for two-year-olds.\u2019\u2019\n\nWaller has three starters in The Everest including Arcadia Queen ($5) and Nature Strip ($23).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to have three horses in such a great race,\u2019\u2019 Waller said. \u201cThe Everest is a talking point around the (racing) world at the moment.\u2019\u2019\n\nSydney\u2019s premier trainer said The Everest is changing the face of Australian racing and creating interest in the sport to a new generation of younger race fans.\n\n\u201cThe Everest is bringing in a new era in racing,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThe race is creating a lot of attention with young people who are watching our sport and seeing what it is all about.\n\n\u201cLike all sports, whether it be the introduction of 20-20 cricket, twilight games, Friday night rugby which was never heard of a few years ago, you have got to move with the times.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t move with the times, we (racing) will fall behind.\u2019\u2019\n\nWaller said The Everest is helping racing cement its premier sporting position between the months of October and November but chose his words carefully when asked to compare Sydney\u2019s new race with the Melbourne Cup.\n\n\u201cThe Melbourne Cup is on the first Tuesday in November and that will never change,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBut I think in time The Everest will rival the Melbourne Cup. These are the races you want to win and be recognised for winning.\n\n\u201cIf a trainer and jockey can win The Everest it will certainly promote their careers.\u2019\u2019\n\nWaller said the sheer quality of sprinters lining up in the world\u2019s richest turf race was undeniable.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the formlines and compare it to other great races, you won\u2019t see as many wins next to their names as you do for The Everest,\u2019\u2019 Waller said. \u201cMost of the slot holders have chosen their horses a long time out and seem to have got it right.\n\n\u201cThe Everest has assembled the best sprinters in Australia, in fact the world with the horse coming out from Ireland (Ten Sovereigns), so it has that international quality.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about The Everest is that most of the runners have had lead-up races.\n\n\u201cThey are not hiding from each other either, they are meeting often and that creates interest.\u2019\u2019", "description": "Coolmore\u2019s crack sprinter Yes Yes Yes will become racing\u2019s $50 million colt if he wins The TAB Everest at Royal Randwick on Saturday.", "authors": ["Ray Thomas"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9a8ebd442840a2b73f20f3c2e59c2750?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
