Do your children use iPads? Can you answer these questions? Do you have air conditioning? Do you walk your kids to school? Do you see the problem with all this?' he asked.\n\nThe Good Morning Britain presenter claimed it was 'hypocritical' of Skeena Rathor to attend the protests while also using electronic items in her own home - and fired off questions asking which ones she owned\n\nAsked if she had a TV, the activist replied: Can you tell me the point you\u2019re trying to make, Piers?\u2019\n\nBecoming increasingly agitated, Piers said angrily, \u2018Sorry, I\u2019m really having a problem here. You\u2019re not answering a single question... Unbelievable. Sorry I\u2019m really frustrated here\u2026 Total waste of time.'\n\nThe exchange began after Piers and Susanna Reid interviewed two Extinction Rebellion activists attending today's protests, who explained they wanted politicians to act to avert the 'climate catastrophe'.\n\nWhen the camera panned to Skeena Rathor in the studio, Piers began asking her about what electronic gadgets she owned.\n\nAsked if she had a TV, she smiled sheepishly and said: Can you tell me the point you\u2019re trying to make, Piers?\u2019\n\nHe repeated the question numerous times, becoming increasingly frustrated when she didn't answer.\n\n\"Will you try answering one of my questions - can you please stop talking,' he said.\n\n\"I'm really having a problem here, I'm really frustrated here. I'd respect you more when you admit what that you actually do.'\n\nBecoming increasingly agitated, Piers said angrily, \u2018Sorry, I\u2019m really having a problem here. You\u2019re not answering a single question... Unbelievable. Sorry I\u2019m really frustrated here\u2026 Total waste of time'\n\nThe campaigner defended herself by saying the problem was with 'the system' and it was 'impossible' not to use electronic items 'unless you live in a wood completely on your own'.\n\nRefusing to let the matter drop, Piers raged: \u2018The truth is you do have a television and you don\u2019t want to admit to having a television is because that immediately throws you into the hypocrisy debate because you\u2019re guzzling up and burning the atmosphere with your TV, and you don\u2019t want to admit it because it makes you look like a rank hypocrite.\u2019\n\nIt came as police called in reinforcements from across Britain after failing to smash Extinction Rebellion's illegal eco-village in central London where activists were free to rave at a giant Orbital gig in Trafalgar Square last night.\n\nThe protesters even managed to expand their territory by almost a third overnight having already shut down two miles of roads around Parliament in the past 48 hours.\n\nToday the activists began the day with a giant yoga session before again blockading Government departments starting with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [DEFRA] - there will also be a mass 'nurse-in' by breastfeeding and bottlefeeding mothers next to Westminster Abbey.", "description": "The Good Morning Britain presenter claimed it was 'hypocritical' of Skeena Rathor to attend the protests while also using electronic items in her own home during the angry exchange on today's show.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/11/19485634-0-image-a-8_1570616541184.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
