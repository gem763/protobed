After hitting 69%, Bitcoin dominance has been relatively flat, leading some to suggest that it is BTC\u2019s time to shine once again.\n\nAnalysts, however, are expecting the altcoin subset to soon begin their crusade higher.\n\nAltcoins to Soon See Price Boom\n\nAnalyst Chonis recently noted that Bitcoin dominance \u2014 the percentage of the cryptocurrency market made up of BTC \u2014 is far from a support level, despite the metric\u2019s stagnation. He thus claimed that he could see altcoins continuing to gain traction \u201cuntil the historic dominance level of 67.2% is truly confirmed as continued support.\u201d\n\n$BTC (dominance)- I could still see giving up a couple more percentage points down to #alt coins until this level of historic market capitalization is truly confirmed as continued support\u2026#bitcoin pic.twitter.com/FLNwAhavva \u2014 Big Chonis\u2694\ufe0fFlux Trading Group\ud83d\ude80 (@BigChonis) October 12, 2019\n\nAnalyst NebraskanGooner has echoed this sentiment. He noted in a recent tweet that his indicator is \u201csignaling a trend reversal in [Bitcoin] dominance\u201d, implying that the metric may trend towards 66%.\n\nThese expectations that Bitcoin may start to underperform altcoins comes as the leading cryptocurrency has started to stagnate \u2014 a market trend that analysts say is indicative of or a precursor to relative price strength in alternative cryptocurrencies. As a trader recently wrote in reference to the chart below:\n\n\u201cThe more I see this PA the more I feel this will be the case. I think people will continue to overanalyze the BTC range and miss out on significant alt movements. Not me.\u201d\n\nRelated Reading: Bitmain CEO Claims Bitcoin Halving May Not Spark Bull Run\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Around three weeks back, altcoins suddenly started to rip higher; Ethereum gained 10% in a single day, Litecoin rocketed up by 8%, XRP gained some 20-30%", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_732185554-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
