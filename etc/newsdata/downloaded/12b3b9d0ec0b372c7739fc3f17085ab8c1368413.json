It was filled with thematic rooms with cheeky sayings on the walls, like \u201cKissing burns 26 calories.\u201d\n\nsource Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images\n\nIn the early days, each of these rooms was carefully curated according to different types of styles.\n\nAlso in 2010, Forever 21 bulked up its pop-culture collections like its \u201cMinnie Muse\u201d line, for which it recruited Disney channel stars Zendaya and Debby Ryan.\n\nThat same year, Nick Jonas moonlighted as a Forever 21 store employee in the CBS hidden camera show \u201cI Get That A Lot,\u201d helping the store to raise its profile.\n\nHere, Nick Jonas helps another surprised customer at Forever 21 during \u201cI Get That A Lot.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Forever 21 continued to open stores, taking over empty storefronts in malls around the nation.\n\ncaption A Forever 21 store preparing to open in Cerritos, California in 2010. source Jeff Gritchen/Getty Images\n\nAs Forever 21 grew around the nation, the company looked for ways to attract even more customers.
