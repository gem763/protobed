In the aftermath of the UK Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on Johnson\u2019s proroguing of parliament, the prime minister did the same, calling the highest court in the land \u201cwrong\u201d in its judgment and threatening \u201cconsequences\u201d.\n\nBoth too have raised the spectre of political violence should they be prevented from carrying out their mission. On Monday, Trump warned of the potential for a civil war if he was impeached. In turn, Johnson\u2019s government has repeatedly suggested that the UK would witness violence on the streets if Brexit wasn\u2019t delivered.\n\nThis kind of talk is more common to the Middle East than to Washington and London. And yet here it has arrived at the same time in both places.\n\nSo what binds the leaders of the US and Britain today, if not a shared ideology?\n\nThe answer may be that both men have been shaped, radicalised even, by a life of immense privilege. We often talk about the radicalising effects of poverty, but rarely consider how a gilded life can shape a person\u2019s actions and their view of the world.\n\nNeither Johnson nor Trump has ever paid for their failures and misdeeds in the way most people do. Career failures, bankrupted businesses, racism, lies, accusations of sexual assault and corruption \u2013 none of it has had any lasting consequence on their rise to the top.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine what repeatedly failing upwards can do to the temperament of someone already born into privilege \u2013 where actions are entirely detached from consequence. Surely it is easier to break the rules if they don\u2019t apply to you?\n\nIt is those famous words that could have come from either of them, but which are attributed to an unguarded Mr Trump, that explains them best: \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it.\u201d\n\nYours,\n\nRichard Hall\n\nMiddle East correspondent", "description": "Britain and the US have a habit of politically aligning every now and then.
