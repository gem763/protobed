It won\u2019t have the staying power as the Russia collusion myth, but it once again shows that the media is the enemy of the people. They\u2019re corrupt. They\u2019re liars. They\u2019re stupid\u2014and when you realize all of that, you can make them do anything. That\u2019s one of the points that\u2019s highlighted in the Netflix documentary about Roger Stone. Love him or hate him, he knows how to own these clowns. With the liberal media\u2019s hatred of Trump, they will fall for almost anything. This Ukraine story is a prime example.\n\nApparently, Trump spoke to a foreign leader. That\u2019s the story. The level of scandal is just\u2026appalling, said by no one serious. Trump supposedly pressured Ukrainian leaders to investigate 2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden. Yeah, Trump can say that\u2014and Ukraine can ignore the request. It\u2019s a conversation of no importance. And now some whistleblower decided to contact the inspector general for the intelligence community? It\u2019s nonsense. The IC isn\u2019t supposed to be snitching to Congress about what the president said, something that former CIA and FBI official Phil Mudd said last week. Mudd, a CNN contributor, said that he nearly \u201cblew a gasket\u201d over this story because of the gross overreach here.\n\nAnd now, we\u2019re hearing that this whole story was based on a second-hand account? Yeah, the whistleblower never actually listened in on these calls, which was buried by CNN in their report. The Daily Wire\u2019s Ashe Schow has more [italicized text indicated CNN\u2019s report]:\n\nBuried in a lengthy CNN article about the complaint is the following paragraph: The whistleblower didn't have direct knowledge of the communications, an official briefed on the matter told CNN. Instead, the whistleblower's concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration's determination that the complaint didn't fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said. Granted, this is yet another anonymous source giving more context on what another anonymous source told a different outlet, but it still calls the entire story into question. The Washington Post first reported the complaint on Wednesday, using anonymous sources and vague descriptions. The outlet placed the story on its front page, with the headline, \u201cTrump\u2019s communications with foreign leader are part of whistleblower complaint that spurred standoff between spy chief and Congress, former officials say.\u201d The story was as vague as the headline, with \u201ctwo former U.S. officials familiar with the matter\u201d who were \u201cspeaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly\u201d claiming Trump made a \u201cpromise\u201d to a world leader, which is apparently wrong. [\u2026] Some in the media suggested Trump withheld $250 million in military aid from Ukraine possibly in relation to whatever \u201cpromise\u201d was made in that telephone call, which, again, the whistleblower didn\u2019t overhear.\n\nTalk about another episode of the media stepping on rakes when reporting on this White House. This isn\u2019t the first time and it won\u2019t be the last. Yeah, and people wonder why these clowns are so despised and distrusted with their other hobby when it comes to the reporting on the Trump White House: these so-called fact-checks they peddle may as well have the citation \"paid for by the DNC\" listed at the end. Trump knows these clowns are morons who will fall for anything. He knows that they will overreact to everything. He has their number. Liberals\u2019 intense hatred for this man will make them suffer serial humiliation. And those who support the president love it.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump has the Democrat-Media complex hook, line, and sinker; he's dragging this out. He wants them to live in shame when the end comes (via Politico):", "description": ".09/23/2019 15:07:59PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/266/742c635b-3781-4dbf-9983-d0ff24a2ff1a.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
