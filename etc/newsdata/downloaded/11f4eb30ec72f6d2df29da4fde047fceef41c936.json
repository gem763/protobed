Pretty much everything went against us today, but we still didn't lose. We deserved the point, 100 per cent.\"\n\nFormer Liverpool midfielder Graeme Souness believed Rashford's goal should have been chalked off, saying of Lindelof's challenge: \"If you're kicked from behind it's a foul. He gets nothing on the ball - it has to be a foul.\"", "description": "Challenge on Origi which infuriated Klopp was picked up by cameras but it was deemed there was not enough contact", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Offside Via Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20661233.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Liverpool-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
