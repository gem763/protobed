But they also believe it was an act born of desperation.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Baha Hassan Neyami, a mechanic who fled the border town of Ras al Ayn with his wife and three children.\n\n\"What I know is that we sacrifice,\" he said. \"The Turkish regime hit Ras al Ayn with airstrikes. We didn't have any place to go. We had to come to [Iraqi] Kurdistan.\"\n\n\"We have more value here,\" said his wife, Hanan. \"They don't let anything happen to Kurds.\"\n\nThe family arrived on Tuesday, along with 182 other Syrian refugees who crossed into northern Iraq by paying smugglers to get them here.\n\nBaha Hassan Neyami is a Syrian Kurd who fled the border town of Ras al Ayn with his wife and three children. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)\n\n\"If it wasn't for them, we couldn't pass,\" said Neyami, speaking at a refugee camp in Domiz, Iraq.\n\nAnother 800 refugees have since arrived using the same route, about 30 kilometres south of the official Semalka crossing.\n\nSemalka is not open to refugees. The Syrian Kurds won't let them leave that way, one border official on the Rojava side confirmed, and the Iraqi Kurds won't let them in that way, either.\n\nThe Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq is assisting refugees if they arrive, however, meeting them at the unofficial crossing and bussing them to reception centres.\n\nComplex relations\n\nThe Iraqi Kurds have a complicated relationship with the YPG and with Turkey, whose investment they rely on for a thriving economy in northern Iraq compared to the rest of the country.\n\nThe main figure heralded on the big YPG billboard at the Semalka border post is Abdullah \u00d6calan, the leader of the People's Workers Party (PKK), who is currently serving a life sentence in Turkey.\n\nThe militant separatist group has waged a bloody, decades-long campaign against the Turkish state.\n\nThe PKK's affiliation with the Syrian YPG is one reason Turkey is trying to drive out \u2014 or neutralize, to use Ankara's language \u2014 the Kurdish militias along its southern flank.\n\nThe PKK is a designated terrorist group in both Canada and the United States.\n\nThis billboard, extolling People\u2019s Workers Party Leader Abdullah Ocalan and the sacrifices of other Kurdish fighters, can be found in Semalka. (Margaret Evans/CBC)\n\nDuring the 1980s, before \u00d6calan was arrested, he based his operations out of Syria, and became a constant thorn in the side of Turkey.\n\nIraq's Kurds will be wary of YPG fighters potentially coming across the border, as the PKK are already ensconced in northern Iraq's Qandil Mountains and have been a regular target of Turkish airstrikes over the years.\n\nBut the Syrian Democratic Forces \u2014 including the YPG \u2014 helped U.S. special forces defeat the so-called Islamic State in northern Syria, and lost more than 10,000 fighters in the struggle.\n\nThe alliance has long angered Turkey.\n\nIt's a complicated picture in a complicated region. But for the Syrian refugees fleeing the fighting, it is a simple story of survival.\n\nAnd Kurdish anger is not reserved for Turkey or its proxy-fighters as they pummel Kurdish towns and villages. Many say they will not forget what they see as a betrayal by the U.S. president.\n\n\"His decision and withdrawing the troops harmed us, harmed Kurds,\" said Neyami. \"When he withdrew, he broke our backs.\"\n\nWith files from Stephanie Jenzer", "description": "Outgunned by the Turkish army and backed into a corner by U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to pull American troops out, the Kurds in northern Syria needed a new protector, writes Margaret Evans.", "authors": ["Europe Correspondent", "Margaret Evans Is A Correspondent Based In The Cbc News London Bureau.
