They also have \u201cthe largest brains of any lemurs relative to their body size.\u201d That blend of brainpower, huge ears and acoustic reverberations enables the animals to generate mental maps of hollow spaces within tree trunks.\n\nOnce aye-ayes locate a highway of insect tunnels, they bite open a hole in the wood. And into that hole they insert their slender middle fingers, which swivel on ball-and-socket joints. Using a \u201creally long, creepy, needle-y claw,\u201d Hartstone-Rose said, the predators snatch grubs out of their tunnels and drag them to the surface.\n\nThe anatomist had dissected hundreds of other primate limbs before he was able to dissect an aye-aye hand. Aye-ayes are very rare. Only about 30 captive aye-ayes live in the United States. Hartstone-Rose dissected aye-aye museum specimens and those that died of natural causes at the Duke Lemur Center in North Carolina, as well as a wild animal that died in Madagascar. \u201cNo animal has ever been killed for any of my own research,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWild aye-ayes are endangered and their population is decreasing, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nIn the aye-aye, Hartstone-Rose and his colleagues were tracing a muscle called the abductor pollices longus, which in humans allows us to stick out thumbs, hitchhiker-style. \u201cThis muscle goes from our forearm to the base of our thumb in you, me and essentially every other primate that has ever been documented,\u201d Hartstone-Rose said. As they followed the aye-aye\u2019s muscle, a funny thing happened on the way toward the thumb. A part of the muscle branched off to the aye-aye palm, below the thumb, and connected to a small nub of bone called the radial sesamoid, named after the tiny seed.\n\nHumans do not have these bones on the thumb side of our hands. But if you trace the pinkie edge of your hand, palm-side-up, you can feel a similar bone called the pisiform where your hand meets your wrist. \u201cIf you look at the base of your own wrist on the pinkie side, there\u2019s a little pointy-out bone like a little protuberance,\u201d Hartstone-Rose said. That\u2019s a sesamoid bone. Our kneecaps are enlarged sesamoid bones, too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe bone nub, in the aye-aye, moves in three directions. It has its own fingerprint. The scientists examined six other specimens, using CT scans as well as dissections. All of the aye-ayes had the pseudo-thumbs.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, 'weirdness compounds weirdness\u2019 is the story that\u2019s going on here,\u201d said Matt Borths, a paleontologist at the Duke Lemur Center, who did not participate in the study. (Borths, when reached by phone, was just a few yards away from fossil jaws from an aye-aye ancestor that lived in Egypt 34 million years ago, the oldest known bones belonging to their lineage.)\n\nBorths said the pseudo-thumb hid in plain sight, probably because it was overshadowed by the curiousness of the aye-aye\u2019s other fingers. \u201cNow that we know to look for them, there\u2019s the potential we may find this\u201d adaptation in the fossil record, the paleontologist said. Borths also wants to know more how the aye-ayes use this thumb. \u201cI just want to watch a lot of videos of aye-ayes climbing around,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe scientists who found the odd thumb suggested this digit evolved to compensate for the aye-aye hands\u2019 extreme specialization. \u201cIf you scaled the aye-aye\u2019s arm up to the size of a human arm, their fingers would be about nine inches long, as opposed to yours, which are like three inches,\u201d Hartstone-Rose said. Those oversize fingers aren\u2019t very good at grasping.\n\nPseudo-thumbs have a special place in evolutionary biology, popularized in Stephen Jay Gould\u2019s 1980 collection of essays \u201cThe Panda\u2019s Thumb.\u201d The ancestors of bears and pandas lacked the need for specialized toes on their paws. Their five digits are aligned in a neat and unopposed row. But the pressures of panda existence \u2014 a reliance on a diet of tough bamboo \u2014 led to their adaptation of sesamoid bones into pseudo-thumbs. They use these thumbs to hold bamboo shoots. Elephants also have elongated sesamoid bones, in their feet, that stabilize their gaits.\n\nAye-ayes, elephants and pandas are very distantly related mammals. Aye-ayes and pandas converged on the same evolutionary trait through opposite paths: the hyper-specialization of the aye-aye hand and the loss of specialization in bear paws.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBecause the anatomy evolved essentially exactly the same in primates and bears,\u201d Hartstone-Rose said, \u201cthen we know that this is a trait that can happen in mammals.\u201d Our wrist muscles and sesamoid bones could accommodate us \u201cin our own lineage,\u201d he hypothesized. \u201cIf, for some reason, we needed to start grasping more with wrist structures.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Aye-aye hands have small \"psuedo-thumbs,\" fingerprints and all, in addition to the five fingers all primates have.", "authors": ["Ben Guarino", "Reporter Covering The Practice", "Culture Of Science"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zmubJkLCfVeE3dabW83v2dhRaUo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5NFLEMRZM5A63GIZWJUOEY4W3M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
