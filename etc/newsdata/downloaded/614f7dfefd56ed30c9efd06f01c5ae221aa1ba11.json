Michael Burgess (R-TX) offered an amendment to allow the president\u2019s counsel to be represented in all of the committees investigating impeachment, not just in the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nWatching User Clip: Watch Democrats Deny Republican Amendments to Impeachment Inquiry Rules @CSPAN https://t.co/teVmRBaFZW \u2014 Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) October 30, 2019\n\nPast impeachments have only been investigated by the House Judiciary Committee, where witnesses could be questioned by counsel for the president. The new process incorporates investigations being conducted by several different committees, and there is no guarantee that witnesses in those committees will ever be questioned by the president\u2019s counsel. That amendment was defeated along strict party lines.\n\nWhen Rep. Rob Wooddall (R-GA) objected to the fact that the new rules continue to allow secret hearings, and to bar the president\u2019s counsel from most of the investigative process, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) claimed that the House\u2019s power over impeachment was unlimited. \u201c[W]e have the power to get the information that we want in the manner in which we want to get it,\u201d he declared.\n\nSimilarly, Democrats defeated a simple amendment to allow members of the House Intelligence Committee to yield speaking time to other members. The resolution only permits them to yield to professional committee staff. The majority also defeated an amendment to allow the minority equal power to object to witnesses called by the chair \u2014 as had been done in previous inquiries \u2014 and claimed Trump was being given more rights than in previous cases.\n\nDemocrats said that concerns about the president\u2019s due process rights did not apply during impeachment, which they likened to the \u201cgrand jury\u201d process in a criminal investigation.\n\nWatching User Clip: Watch Rep.

Alcee Hastings (D-FL), a former federal judge who holds the distinction of being one of only eight people in the history of the U.S. ever impeached and removed from office.\n\nThis story is developing.\n\nJoel B.
