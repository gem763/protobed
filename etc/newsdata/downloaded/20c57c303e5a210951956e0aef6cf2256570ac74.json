Maro isn\u2019t the most naturally-gifted cricketer, but he managed to get Jamie out quite convincingly.\n\nElliot Daly (right) caught Jamie George (batsman) off the bowling of Maro Itoje (left)\n\n\u2018George, feigning indignation, seized the microphone at a press conference and said: \u2018It\u2019s time to settle this. Obviously, yes, he did get me out, but I\u2019d scored about 150 before that.\n\n'I was batting for about two-and-a-half hours, which is what you didn\u2019t see. I\u2019m a generous bloke and it was my time to give someone else a go so I flicked one straight into Elliot\u2019s hands. Did he get me out or did I get myself out? I don\u2019t know...\u2019\n\nGeorge and Daly were joined for media duties on Monday by back-up scrum-half Willi Heinz - who they introduced as a new member of the England squad\u2019s social committee.\n\nWilli Heinz has revealed that the squad have been giving Sam Underhill a hard time\n\nHe proceeded to throw Bath flanker Sam Underhill under a bus - figuratively-speaking - as he said: \u2018Sam Underhill has been trying really hard to set up his own social committee group where he adds us all into the WhatsApp group and we all immediately leave!\n\n'He\u2019s really trying his best, but isn\u2019t getting anywhere.\u2019 The jibe is the latest evidence that Underhill and his fellow \u2018Kamikaze Kid\u2019, Tom Curry, appear to be the butt of most jokes within the Red Rose ranks.\n\nIreland are braced for the possibility of disruption caused by Typhoon Hagibis - meaning \u2018Velocity\u2019 - which is surging towards the south west of Japan.\n\nThere is a chance that winds in excess of 100mph could affect the Ireland v Samoa match in Fukuoka on Saturday. The Irish team management have been alerted to contingency plans, which could see the fixture moved to another location - as yet unknown - or put back to Sunday, before Pool A\u2019s final game between Japan and Scotland.\n\nIf the match was cancelled, it would be deemed a 0-0 draw, which could mean Ireland exit the tournament due to the weather, so all efforts will be made to ensure the fixture goes ahead.\n\nJoe Schmidt's Ireland side are concerned about the possible disruption of the weather\n\nNeal Hatley, England\u2019s scrum coach, explained on Monday how he has benefited from tutorials with French scrum guru Marc dal Maso. Their meetings led to some spontaneous practical demonstrations. \u2018We had good conversations,\u2019 said Hatley on Monday.\n\n\u2018I ended up scrummaging with him in the lobby of a hotel at 11.45pm because he wanted to show me that if you change feet, the effect it could have. It\u2019s brilliant to have somebody who, like myself, tries to invest himself in scrums; the art, history and tradition of it and how you can gain a psychological edge.\n\n'We met in Toulon, on the beach. A lovely spot. I arrived at about 10pm from Montpellier. He came straight down to see me and by a quarter to 12, he was on one leg in the dining room, showing me the best angle for the hooker to attack it, which was brilliant.\u2019", "description": "WORLD CUP DIARY: England players were publicly bickering on Monday.. over a game of cricket.
