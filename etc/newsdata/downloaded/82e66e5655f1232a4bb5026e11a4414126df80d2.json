October 08, 2019. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images)\n\nMarkets will be tuned into the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement on Wednesday afternoon to see if the central bank delivers on a much anticipated third rate cut of the year.\n\nAs of Tuesday night, federal funds futures markets were pricing in a 97.8% chance of the Fed cutting by 25 basis points at the conclusion of its meeting Oct. 30.\n\nBut the key question is whether the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will telegraph more rate cuts in the near future. Some Wall Street analysts have speculated the Fed could stop after a rate cut on Wednesday, since three rate cuts were the magic number for the Fed\u2019s effort to stave off a recession in 1995-1996.\n\nThings worth watching: commentary from Powell on the Fed\u2019s decision in mid-October to resume organic balance sheet growth, in addition to whether there will be dissents. In the Fed\u2019s last meeting, Powell faced three dissents, the largest divergence in policy suggestions since Powell became Fed chair in 2018.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s policy decision will be announced at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday and will not come with a new round of economic projections. Powell\u2019s press conference will begin at 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nBrian Cheung is a reporter covering the banking industry and the intersection of finance and policy for Yahoo Finance.
