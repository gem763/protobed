I don't think the government or the Commonwealth Office have any clout to do anything. I don't think Boris will do any good, either.\"\n\nSpeaking after the 45 minute-long meeting, a family spokesman told Sky News : \"To say we are disappointed with the outcome of the meeting would be an understatement.\"\n\nThe teen's death has seen a furious row erupt between the US and UK, with Mr Raab having called US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and urged the American government to \"do the right thing by Harry Dunn's family\".\n\n(Image: Mark Thomas/REX)\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to speak personally to US President Donald Trump if there is not movement from the American government.\n\nSpeakring yesterday Harry's dad said: \"I\u2019m hoping with the pressure from our Prime Minister if they look at the case and reassess what diplomatic immunity means.\"\n\nAdmitting there needs to be an overhaul in the law, Charlotte added: \"We can\u2019t let it happen again. She\u2019s taken our son.\"", "description": "Harry Dunn's parents want Anne Sacoolas to return to the UK to talk to them after she flew to the US following his death", "authors": ["Oliver Milne", "Image", "Itv", "Mark Thomas Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article20536438.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_US-diplomats-wife-leaves-UK-amid-police-probe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
