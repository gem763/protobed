For instance, it made the bold decision to strip the home button from the iPhone X and introduce a cool security system which unlocks the device by scanning its owner\u2019s face.\n\nApple has already introduced various systems offering \u2018haptic feedback\u2019 including 3D touch, which allows you to press into the screen and makes it feel as if you\u2019re actually pushing down on a key.\n\nIf it introduced virtual keyboards, it could allow Macbooks to remove the keyboard and have a screen in its place.\n\nIt would also allow iPads and iPhones to become much more useful by simulating the experience of using a real keyboard.", "description": "Astonishing tech uses an 'electrostatic' field to make it seem as if you're pressing real keys, rather than a screen.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-04-at-16.38.53-6f20_1570203780.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
