The spacecraft, which arrived in lunar orbit one month later, consists of the orbiter vehicle, the Vikram lander and the Pragyan rover. The Vikram lander will be the first Indian-made object to touch the lunar face, after which it will deploy the artificial intelligenve-powered six-wheeled Pragyan rover.\n\nChandrayaan-2 will also be the first mission to the southern pole of the moon, where the U.S. intends to land astronauts by 2024. This region is known to contain frozen water, an element crucial to organic life that NASA says is also used in cooling equipment and needed for production of rocket fuel for missions farther into the solar system.\n\nChandrayaan-2 Vikram lunar lander and Pragyan lunar rover.

The Vikram landing craft will test atmospheric conditions during its descent to the lunar surface.\n\nThe Indian Space Research Organization says \u201cChandrayaan-2 attempts to foster a new age of discovery, increase our understanding of space,\" and stimulate technological advances,\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "India is set to become the fourth nation to land an object on the Moon with its $150 million Chandrayaan-2 mission.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/rocket.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
