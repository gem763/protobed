The child's mother, 67, claims she conceived naturally\n\nThe mother, a retired doctor, is pictured recovering in hospital in Zaozhuang after surgery\n\nThe father, a 68-year-old retired lawyer, said the baby was feeding on his wife's breast milk\n\nTian told Chinese media her pregnancy was an accident. She said she had experienced bleeding and initially thought she was ill.\n\nThe pensioner said she only discovered she was pregnant when she went to hospital for a health check, according to Jinan Times.\n\nShe told the newspaper: 'I didn't want it, initially.'\n\nThe hospital said it could not confirm that Tian had conceived naturally because she was already pregnant when it took her as a patient.\n\nTian's daughter was born on Friday in the Chinese city of Zaozhuang in eastern China.\n\nShe weighed 2,560 grams (5.6 pounds) at birth. The couple have named their child 'Tianci', meaning 'gift from heaven'.\n\nA midwife hands the father, Huang, his newborn daughter in Zaozhuang city's Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital, eastern China, after the girl was delivered by Caesarean section\n\nTian is seen being pushed out of the operating theatre after giving birth to a 5.6lb healthy girl on Friday. She may be the world's oldest natural mother if her claim proves to be true\n\nWHAT ARE THE HEALTH RISKS OF A LATE PREGNANCY? Greater difficulty in initially conceiving a child, with the personal and psychological difficulties that this can cause.\n\nIncreased risk of complications for both mother and infant during pregnancy and delivery (although the actual size of the risk may be small).\n\nGreater risk of general maternal health problems, such as high blood pressure, which can contribute to complications.\n\nHigher risk of miscarriage in women above the age of 35.\n\nHigher risk of having twins or triplets, which is itself associated with higher risk of complications.\n\nIncreased chance of having a baby with a congenital abnormality, such as Down's syndrome.\n\nIncreased risk of pre-eclampsia.\n\nIncreased risk of complications during delivery, such as prolonged labour, need for assisted delivery or Caesarean section, or stillbirth.

She delivered her son by C-section in 1997\n\nThe Chinese couple already had two children before 'Tianci', including a son born in 1977, two years before China imposed a one-child policy to control its burgeoning population.\n\nReports of the birth in China have drew criticism on the country's Twitter-like platform Weibo.\n\n'The parents are too selfish,' one person wrote. 'At their advanced age they have no ability to take care of a kid, and the pressure will be on the older siblings.'\n\n'Poor child, she's going to start taking care of her elderly parents by the time she's 20,' wrote another.\n\nHuang (right) checks on his wife Tian after she delivered their third child at the age of 67\n\nHuang, a proud father, holds up a commemorative birth certificate gifted by the hospital\n\nOthers wondered if Tian and Huang would be penalised for having more than the current allowance of two children.\n\nIn response to criticism, Huang said he and his wife had their plans for the child.\n\n'I know they (web users) have said something [about us]. I wish to tell them not to interfere in the privacy of my family, especially that of my children,' Huang said.\n\n'The child has been born. She is a gift from heaven. We will protect her,' he added.", "description": "This is the first footage of a baby girl born to a 67-year-old retired doctor who claimed to have conceived naturally.
