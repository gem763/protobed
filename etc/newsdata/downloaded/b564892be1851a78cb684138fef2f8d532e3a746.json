I think he\u2019s going to be a good challenger.\n\n\u2018Whether it\u2019s me, and I\u2019m still here, or whether it\u2019s somebody else, I think he\u2019s going to be a good challenger. I think he\u2019s definitely going to make it to fight for a world title one day.\n\n\u2018To be a champion? Who knows? But I think he\u2019ll get to that point. I like a lot of the other guys as well, but for me he stands out the most.\u2019\n\nWilder has written off Usyk\u2019s chances of being a threat in the heavyweight division (Picture: Getty)\n\nUsyk, meanwhile, will make his long-awaited step up from cruiserweight to heavyweight when he takes on Tyrone Spong later this month, though Wilder has written off the talented Ukrainian\u2019s chances of ever beating him.\n\nWilder added: \u2018Oleksandr Usyk is not a threat to me. He\u2019s too small for me. He does a lot of movement and stuff like that, but that don\u2019t phase me.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Deontay Wilder has picked out Daniel Dubois as the stand-out up-and-coming heavyweight boxer, while he says Oleksandr Usyk is \u2018too small\u2019 to pose a serious threat to him.
