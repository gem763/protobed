My belly started hurting and my heart started going crazy,\u201d Ndgungu said, according to Metro UK. \u201cI was panicking because that only happens when I consume meat \u2013 this doesn\u2019t happen when I have other food. I\u2019m traumatized for life now \u2013 I\u2019m never going to Greggs again.\u201d\n\nGROCERY STORE CLERK ARRESTED FOR ALLEGEDLY LACING BEAN DIP WITH METHAMPHETAMINE, SERVING IT TO CO-WORKERS\n\nNdungu had returned to the bakery and was offered a $2 refund by the manager.\n\nThe unsatisfied woman then called the bakery\u2019s customer service hotline and she was instead offered a $36 voucher, but that too was not good enough for Ndungu who wanted an apology.\n\n\u2018I was asking for a public apology to make people aware that they should watch out for things like this,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople can be allergic to pork and potentially die from such a stupid mistake.
