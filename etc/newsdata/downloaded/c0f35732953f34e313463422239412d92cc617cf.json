It\u2019s an indication of how Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s aggressive foreign policy could come to threaten his push for economic modernisation.\n\nAramco can restart a significant volume of the halted oil production within days, but needs weeks to restore full output capacity, said people familiar with the matter. The company could consider declaring itself unable to fulfill contracts on some international shipments - know as force majeure - if the resumption of full capacity at Abqaiq takes weeks, they said.\n\nThat would rattle oil markets and cast a shadow on Aramco\u2019s preparations for what could be the world\u2019s biggest initial public offering. It\u2019s also set to escalate a showdown pitting Saudi Arabia and the US against Iran, which backs proxy groups from Yemen to Syria and Lebanon.\n\nIf the disruption is \u201cprotracted it could be a big challenge for the oil markets,\u201d Mele Kyari, chief executive officer of state producer Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, told Bloomberg Television on Sunday.\n\nState energy producer Saudi Aramco lost about 5.7 million barrels per day of output on Saturday after 10 unmanned aerial vehicles struck the world\u2019s biggest crude-processing facility in Abqaiq, and also the kingdom\u2019s second-biggest oil field in Khurais.\n\nStock index tumbles\n\nThe attack is the biggest on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure since Iraq\u2019s Saddam Hussein fired Scud missiles into the kingdom during the first Gulf War. The kingdom\u2019s benchmark stock index tumbled as much as 3.1% on Sunday in Riyadh.\n\nIran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attacks, but US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo blamed Iran directly, without offering evidence for that conclusion. Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry described Pompeo\u2019s remarks as \u201cblind and fruitless accusations.\u201d\n\nTehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy. Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen. \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) September 14, 2019\n\nSaudi oil facilities as well as foreign tankers in and around the Persian Gulf have been the target of several attacks over the past year. The escalation coincided with the President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull the US out of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran and re-imposed crippling economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe Houthis, who are fighting Saudi-backed forces in Yemen, have claimed responsibility for most of the strikes against Aramco installations.\n\n\u201cWork is underway to restore production and a progress update will be provided in around 48 hours,\u201d Amin Nasser, Aramco\u2019s president and chief executive officer, said on in a statement on Sunday.\n\nCrude Reserves\n\nAramco, which pumped about 9.8 million barrels a day in August, will be able to keep customers supplied for several weeks by drawing on a global storage network. The Saudis hold millions of barrels in tanks in the kingdom itself, plus three strategic locations around the world: Rotterdam in the Netherlands, Okinawa in Japan, and Sidi Kerir on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt.\n\nInstead of supplying some customers with the usual crude oil grades of Arab Light or Arab Extra Light, the company may offer them Arab Heavy and Arab Medium as a replacement, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nSmoke Plumes\n\nA satellite picture from a NASA near real-time imaging system published early on Sunday, more than 24 hours after the attack, showed the huge smoke plume over Abqaiq had dissipated completely. But four additional plumes to the south-west, over the Ghawar oilfield, the world\u2019s largest, were still clearly visible.\n\nWhile that field wasn\u2019t attacked, its crude and gas is sent to Abqaiq for processing. The smoke most likely indicated flaring, the industry term for what happens when a facility stops suddenly and excess oil and natural gas is safely burned off.\n\nFor the global oil market, the 5.7 million barrels a day Saudi halt is the single worst sudden disruption ever, surpassing the loss of Kuwaiti and Iraqi petroleum supply in August 1990, when Saddam Hussein invaded his neighbour. It also exceeds the loss of Iranian oil output in 1979 during the Islamic Revolution, according to data from the US Department of Energy.\n\nGovernment Action\n\nThe US government said it\u2019s prepared to dip into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if necessary to offset any market disruption. The International Energy Agency, which helps coordinate industrialised countries\u2019 emergency fuel stockpiles, said it was monitoring the situation.\n\nThe key question for governments, oil traders and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, in which Saudi Arabia is the largest producer, is how long the disruption lasts.\u201cThe global economy can ill afford higher oil prices at a time of economic slowdown,\u201d Ole Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in Copenhagen, said by email.\n\n- With assistance from Mahmoud Habboush, Verity Ratcliffe, Manus Cranny, Giovanni Prati and Anthony DiPaola.", "description": "Saudi Arabia is racing to restore oil production after a brazen drone strike on a key Aramco facility slashed its output by half, removing about 5% of world supply.", "authors": ["Nayla Razzouk", "Javier Blas"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2579/a079375373334c16ae76c5f997f40e2c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
