Those talks broke down after the U.S. side rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for partially surrendering its nuclear capabilities.\n\nNorth Korea followed the summit with belligerent rhetoric and a slew of short-range weapons tests that were widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage ahead of a possible resumption of negotiations.\n\nChoe\u2019s announcement came after North Korea praised Trump last month for suggesting that Washington may pursue an unspecified \u201cnew method\u201d in nuclear negotiations with the North. North Korea also has welcomed Trump\u2019s decision to fire hawkish former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who advocated a \u201cLibya model\u201d of unilateral denuclearization as a template for North Korea.\n\nThe 2004 disarmament of Libya is seen by Pyongyang as a deeply provocative comparison because Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was killed following U.S.-supported military action in his country seven years after giving up a rudimentary nuclear program that was far less advanced than North Korea\u2019s.\n\nThe office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who lobbied hard to set up the first summit between Kim and Trump last year in Singapore, welcomed Choe\u2019s announcement and expressed hope that the resumed talks would result in \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in denuclearization and stabilization of peace.\n\nThat\u2019s could be a tall order. Under the high-stakes diplomacy between Trump and Kim, which has been driven chiefly by the personalities of the leaders rather than an established diplomatic process, working-level meetings have been useful for fleshing out the logistics of summits but unproductive in hammering out the details of a nuclear deal that has eluded the countries for decades.\n\nThe stalemate of past months has revealed fundamental differences between the two sides. North Korea says it will never unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons and missiles and insists that U.S.-led sanctions against it should be lifted first before any progress in negotiations.\n\nThe Trump administration has vowed to maintain robust economic pressure until the North takes real steps toward fully and verifiably relinquishing its nuclear program.\n\nThis are doubts about whether Kim would ever voluntarily deal away an arsenal he may see as his strongest guarantee of survival.\n\nAfter their Singapore summit in June 2018, Trump and Kim issued a vague statement calling for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing how or when it would occur.\n\nThe lack of substance and fruitless working-level talks set up the failure in Hanoi, which the Americans blamed on what they said were excessive North Korean demands for sanctions relief in exchange for dismantling an aging nuclear facility in Yongbyon. Trump and Kim met for the third time at the inter-Korean border on June 30 and agreed that working-level talks between the countries should resume.", "description": "Nuclear negotiations have been at a standstill since talks in February between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump broke down.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9338f22100003300510716.jpeg?cache=xkflpa4ijd&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
