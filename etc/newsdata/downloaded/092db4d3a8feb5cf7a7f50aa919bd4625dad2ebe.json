Rand Paul (R-KY) for supporting the move.\n\nMcCain said, \u201cThese special forces officers are standing and protecting terrorists, ISIS terrorists in jail, and now they\u2019re going to be left without American soldiers fighting alongside them. Erdogan, right this moment, is referring to the Kurds as terrorists. And just I don\u2019t understand why we\u2019re living in a country right now, and I\u2019m very happy there\u2019s outrage on both sides. I\u2019m happy there seems to be something Republicans and Democrats are coming forward, but this idea\u2014and you\u2019re having Rand Paul on tomorrow, and I\u2019m not going to be here tomorrow for personal reasons, but I want you to ask him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is blood on anyone\u2019s hands, starting with his and President Trump, who\u2019s letting this happen because there are people being slaughtered after standing with our troops in the Middle East for an extremely long time, fighting against terror cells,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe are not entering into a foreign war. They are proxies supporting us. The whole point of having proxies is, so we don\u2019t get into another war. Have we not learned the lessons of 9/11? I don\u2019t understand it! I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m upset, but this has been going on for a week. These people are being killed and slaughtered!\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Thursday's broadcast of ABC's \"The View,\" co-host Meghan McCain criticized President Donald Trump for withdrawing U.S. troops out of Northern Syria which is allowing Turkish forces to attack the Kurds. | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/Meghan-McCain.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
