A short delay might increase pressure on parliament to approve a deal.\n\nThe European Commission took note on Tuesday of the vote in the British parliament and said it would wait for London to tell it what\u2019s next.\n\n\u201cEuropean Council President (Donald Tusk) is consulting leaders on the UK\u2019s request for an extension until 31 January 2020,\u201d she said. A spokesman for Tusk declined comment.\n\nSenior EU officials said the 27 countries that would remain in the EU after Britain leaves would \u201ccertainly not\u201d react immediately. \u201cWe stay calm,\u201d one senior diplomat said.\n\nIrish PM Leo Varadkar welcomed the vote in favour of Johnson\u2019s legislation.\n\n\u201cWe will now await further developments from London and Brussels about next steps including timetable for the legislation and the need for an extension,\u201d Varadkar said.\n\nAhead of the vote, Johnson had warned parliament that if it defeated him on the timetable and forced a delay until January then he would abandon his attempt to ratify the deal and push for an election instead under the slogan of \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d.\n\nIn his statement after the votes in parliament, Johnson did not mention an election. Johnson would need the support of parliament to call one.\n\nSlideshow (23 Images)\n\nOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn called on Johnson to work with other parties to ensure a reasonable timetable to discuss the deal. Some in the Labour Party expect a short extension, with Brexit being resolved and then an election within months.\n\nBehind the daily Brexit combat in parliament, in the courts and at late-night EU summits, a much bigger game is being played over whether Brexit will happen at all.\n\nJohnson faces legislative booby traps at every juncture, but the opponents of Brexit are also deeply divided - one of the reasons their campaign to \u201cRemain\u201d failed in the 2016 vote.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday it was up to the EU to decide whether it wanted to delay Brexit and for how long, after a defeat in parliament made ratification of his deal by the Oct. 31 deadline almost impossible.", "authors": ["William James", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443810920&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L1M6", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
