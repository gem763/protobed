The first British store is pictured above\n\nBoth chief executive Dan Cathy and his late father Samuel, who founded the chain in 1946, have publically made donations towards anti-LGBT+ groups.\n\nAfter Mr Cathy Jr publicly opposed same-sex marriage in 2012, the LGBT community began a series of boycotts, kiss-ins and same-sex marriages outside a selection of the 2,300 restaurants across the US.\n\nAnd now the company is struggling to expand further through America.\n\nChief Executive Dan Cathy (pictured) publicly opposed same-sex marriage in 2012 and made donations to anti-LGBT+ groups, as did his late father Samuel who founded the chain in 1946\n\nRider University in New Jersey refused to allow a Chick-fil-A store on campus despite popular demand from students and San Antonio International Airport, Texas, also removed the existing store from its expansion plans.\n\nSamuel Cathy used Chick-fil-A profits to fund charities including Exodus International, a group which promoted gay and transgender conversion therapy.\n\nHis son has also been accused of recently providing $1.9 million (\u00a31.4 million) to the charity Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which opposes same-sex relationships.\n\nAfter Chick-fil-A announced its plans for its Reading branch, the decision was condemned by LGBT rights groups across the UK.\n\nReading Pride said: 'The chain's ethos and moral stance goes completely against our values, and that of the UK as we are a progressive country that has legalised same-sex marriage for some years and continues to strive towards equality.'\n\nThe group organised protests against the restaurant and called for a boycott of the company.\n\nOn Friday, the Oracle announced that it would not extend Chick-fil-A's initial six-month lease.\n\nReading Pride said it still plans to hold a protest this morning despite the announcement and will continue to protest against the restaurant until it closes in six months' time. A box of the firm's chicken is pictured above\n\nA statement from the Oracle said: 'We always look to introduce new concepts for our customers, however, we have decided on this occasion that the right thing to do is to only allow Chick-Fil-A to trade with us for the initial six-month pilot period, and not to extend the lease any further.'\n\nReading Pride said it still plans to hold a protest this morning despite the announcement and will continue to protest against the restaurant until it closes in six months' time.\n\nAfter Mr Cathy Jr publicly opposed same-sex marriage in 2012, LGBT people began a series of boycotts, kiss-ins and same-sex marriages outside the restaurants across the US.
