Plank\u2019s new titles will be executive chairman and brand chief, the company said.\n\nThe leadership transition comes at an important time for Under Armour, which is undergoing a turnaround as it tries to jumpstart sluggish domestic sales. Judging by the stock\u2019s reaction, it appeared that Wall Street viewed the incoming CEO as a positive for the brand. Shares of Under Armour were last trading up about 2.5% near $20.53.\n\nFrisk, a retail veteran with 30 years experience in apparel and footwear, joined Under Armour halfway through 2017 after serving as CEO of footwear giant The ALDO Group, and previously held leadership positions at VF Corporation.\n\n\u201cAs my partner during the most transformative chapter in our history, [Frisk] has been exceptional in his ability to translate our brand\u2019s vision into world-class execution by focusing on our long-term strategy and re-engineering our ecosystem through a strategic, operational and cultural transformation,\u201d Plank said in a statement.\n\n\u2018An important evolution\u2019\n\nFILE - In this March 31, 2011, file photo, Kevin Plank, founder and CEO of Under Armour, appears on the \"America's Nightly Scoreboard\" program on the Fox Business Network, in New York.

Under Armour will report its third-quarter earnings results on Nov. 4.\n\nAnalysts at Baird called the CEO transition \u201can important evolution\u201d for the company, allowing for Frisk to take the \u201cfull day-to-day reign\u201d and Plank to have \u201cgreater strategic freedom.\u201d Baird, which maintains an outperform rating on the stock, added that the move is also a \u201cdual-vote of confidence\u201d in both the board and Frisk.\n\n\u201cWe expect the move to elevate Frisk to the CEO role to be viewed favorably internally as well as externally with investors, given his proven track record spanning nearly 30 years across footwear/ apparel brands plus vital role in the brand's ongoing transformation over the past ~2 years,\u201d analyst Jonathan Komp wrote in a note to clients.\n\n\u201cAs CEO, Frisk formally will have the \u2018wheel to steer the ship\u2019 in regard to ongoing execution of UAA's transformation, while Plank should have greater freedom/flexibility to help provide vision/leadership for Frisk and to pursue other bigger-picture opportunities for the brand,\u201d Komp added.\n\nPiperJaffray noted that founder transitions \u201ccan be challenging,\u201d but they\u2019re \u201cfavorable\u201d on this announcement, with the bank also citing Plank\u2019s newfound freedom as a bonus.\n\nNow, the founder can \u201ccontinue to focus on the product aspects of the brand he founded while allowing Patrik Frisk to further expand his leadership & operational roles as CEO,\u201d analyst Erinn Murphy wrote. \u201cMr. Frisk, from our view, has been one of the key architects behind the brand's current turnaround and we'd expect his leadership to usher in stability within the ranks.\u201d\n\nYet analysts at Oppenheimer maintained a \u201crather subdued stance\u201d on the company\u2019s prospects. They noted that \u201csales growth at the brand is apt to languish, against now much stronger competition within the broader athleisure category.\u201d\n\nOppenheimer added that \u201cwe interpret today\u2019s news from Under Armour as a potential signal that the company continues to struggle at least somewhat in its repositioning efforts.\u201d\n\nAt the investor day in December 2018, Plank outlined how \u201cinstrumental\u201d Frisk has been in transforming the company\u2019s operations and strategy, and how he helped Under Armour \u201csupercharge our ability to get stronger, faster and smarter.\u201d Frisk then emphasized that the company\u2019s target customer is the \u201cfocus performer\u201d despite the criticism the company has faced around missing the athleisure trend.\n\nThe founder even pulled up a photo of the executive pair unknowingly showing up at an event in New York wearing the same Under Armour outfit from head-to-toe.\n\n\u201cSo if you have any questions, we're certainly in sync, I'd say. There you have it,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nJulia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.
