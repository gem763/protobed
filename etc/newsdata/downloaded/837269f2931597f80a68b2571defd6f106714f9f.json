His shop is located halfway between San Francisco and Sacramento.\n\n\"We had to shut down the shop. I had to send my employees home and try to contact my customers to tell them we can't service them today. We don't know when this is going to be over because PG&E left it open,\" he told FOX Business.\n\n\"It would take a pretty significant generator to run an automotive shop. It's not realistic for long-term,\" Susman added.\n\nHe would consider taking legal action against PG&E, describing the shutdown as \"completely irresponsible.\"\n\n\"It's been a giant mess \u2026 for decades now,\" Susman said. \"PG&E continues to raise prices to pay for lawsuits, continues to get bailed out by the state \u2026 Shareholders continue to make profits.\"\n\nThe company's \"Public Safety Power Shutoff\" could affect about 30 California counties \u2014 including all but two counties in the Bay Area.\n\n\"We understand the effect this event can have on our customers,\" PG&E spokeswoman Kristi Jourdan told FOX Business. \"We don't take this action lightly.\"\n\nShe said PG&E couldn't anticipate which areas could experience the longest shutdowns because the company has to physically inspect infrastructure to make sure it hasn't been damaged by winds.\n\nSome businesses, like Holly's Hill Vineyards east of Sacramento, are resorting to generators.\n\n\"We hedged our bets a little bit by doing things in advance, since we knew power was likely going to come off,\" Holly's Hill winemaker Josh Bendick told FOX Business, adding that he thought PG&E did a good job communicating about the shutdown.\n\nThe vineyard has resorted to generator power to run the \"essential stuff,\" he said. But being in a rural area, the business relies on power for water and is having to bring in portable toilets ahead of a weekend event.\n\n\"It's affecting the way we\u2019re making wine right now \u2026 We're postponing picking grapes because we can't process them,\" Bendick added. \"Hopefully the power will be back on [next week] because it's time-critical.\"\n\nHe thinks the outrage over the shutdown could make more of an impact this year since it affects more people than last year, when Holly's Hill was also affected.\n\nSchools are shutting down, too.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nPG&E has turned off electricity in the Upper Lake area, which is about 100 miles northwest of Sacramento, as of 1 a.m. Schools were closed Wednesday and will handle power shutdowns on a day-to-day basis Upper Lake Elementary School posted on Facebook.\n\nSome of the most destructive and deadly blazes in modern California history were sparked by PG&E power lines. Winds can knock down live wires and power poles or drive trees and other vegetation into contact with them.\n\nJourdan advised affected California residents to check pge.com/pspsupdates and PG&'s Twitter for the latest updates.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nFOX Business' Christian de La Chappelle contributed to this report.", "description": "The company made the move to cut the risk of wildfires that\u00a0have plagued\u00a0California repeatedly in recent years.", "authors": ["Evie Fordham"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/camp-fire-1-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
