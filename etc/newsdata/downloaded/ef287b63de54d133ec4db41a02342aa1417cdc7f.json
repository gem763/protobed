My team and I saw this deflection firsthand. We were given the runaround by the FBI. No one was designated to receive information related to Kavanaugh; people trying to help were referred to an FBI \u201ctip line.\u201d\n\nThat was also unusual. Usually, FBI agents want to talk with people who claim to have information and to take statements (often referred to as \u201c302s\u201d). A witness interview allows agents to pursue lines of questioning and to evaluate credibility. A tip line may supplement that process, but it ordinarily does not replace it.\n\nAnother flag went up when FBI Director Christopher Wray began to disavow responsibility for the investigation. He pointed out very publicly that the Kavanaugh investigation was not being run under FBI investigative protocols but following directions from the White House \u2014 a passing of the buck seemingly to distance his organization from what it had to know was a bogus investigative effort. Indeed, Wray told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in October that the FBI\u2019s investigation of the sexual assault claims was \u201climited in scope,\u201d and that the bureau\u2019s authority to carry out the investigation was \u201cas requested by the adjudicating agency. \u2026 In this case, it\u2019s the White House.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Sheldon Whitehouse", "Usatoday.Com Story Opinion Fbi-Kavanaugh-Investigation-Red-Flags-Shoddy-Work-Product-Column"], "top_image": ""}
