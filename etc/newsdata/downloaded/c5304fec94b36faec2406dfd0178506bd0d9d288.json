Cabello is widely considered the second most powerful man in Venezuela and, through the years, has been the subject of speculation that those closest to Maduro are planning to overthrow him. Cabello has yet to make any public acts in defiance of Maduro, however.\n\nCabello is also the host of a television show on Venezuelan state television, which he uses to denigrate pro-democracy dissidents and the United States.\n\nCabello is making his journey as most of the world\u2019s heads of state convene in New York for the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly. Despite not being legally Venezuela\u2019s president, the U.N. invited Maduro to attend, but he declined.\n\nDictator Kim Jong-un will also be among the few world leaders not to attend the General Assembly.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s foreign ministry posted images of Cabello landing in North Korea on Tuesday for what it called a \u201chigh-level visit.\u201d\n\nPresidente de la Asamblea Nacional Constituyente, Diosdado Cabello, arriba a la Rep\u00fablica Popular Democr\u00e1tica de Corea, en visita de alto nivel.#VenezuelaAvanza pic.twitter.com/MF5B4yhvG8 \u2014 Canciller\u00eda Venezuela \ud83c\uddfb (@CancilleriaVE) September 24, 2019\n\nThe Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), Pyongyang\u2019s state propaganda outlet, reported that Cabello and his team spent part of the day worshipping at the statues of Kim\u2019s father and grandfather, the dictators Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-il, before the current communist tyrant hosted a \u201creception\u201d to honor Venezuela\u2019s \u201cBolivarian Revolution.\u201d Cabello and his team also held talks with \u201cPak Thae Song, chairman of the DPRK [North Korea] Supreme People\u2019s Assembly,\u201d his counterpart in North Korea\u2019s puppet legislature.\n\n\u201cAddressing the event [the reception], Pak Thae Song said that the Party, government, and people of Venezuela are achieving successes in the struggle for the victorious advance of the Bolivarian revolution, foiling the sanctions and sabotages by hostile forces,\u201d KCNA reported. \u201cHe expressed belief that the militant friendship and fraternal ties forged between the two countries on the road of anti-imperialist independence would invariably grow stronger.\u201d\n\nKCNA did not offer any details on what Cabello was discussing with the North Koreans or what policies they agreed to advance together. Lisandro Sol\u00f3rzano, a member of the PSUV, hinted at Cabello\u2019s meeting being necessary to \u201cstrengthen cooperative ties in various strategic areas\u201d on Twitter.\n\nMaduro typically uses Cabello to intimidate and silence enemies, not as an envoy. Cabello most recently stood atop a reported purge of the PSUV after Venezuelan President Juan Guaid\u00f3 announced in May that he had convinced senior Maduro henchmen to defect. While Guaid\u00f3\u2019s attempt to acquire his constitutional powers failed, Maduro reportedly ordered Cabello to sweep any suspected traitors out of the party.\n\nCabello appears to be in North Korea as a substitute because top diplomat, Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, is in New York currently with Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez for the U.N. General Assembly. Maduro himself landed in Moscow on Tuesday to ask Russia for more money to prop up his failed state.\n\nDefecting senior members of both Maduro\u2019s regime and the previous Hugo Ch\u00e1vez have accused Cabello of being the head of an international cocaine trafficking scheme. Leamsy Salazar, Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s former security chief, said in 2015 that he personally witnessed Cabello order shipments of \u201ctons of cocaine\u201d throughout the Western Hemisphere. The Wall Street Journal published multiple reports detailing Cabello\u2019s activities as a drug lord and later won a lawsuit against Cabello when the latter sued for defamation, on the grounds of the reports not being proven false.\n\nIn May, the U.S. Treasury Department branded Cabello a specially designated person, limiting his potential economic activities in the United States, over his engagement in drug trafficking.\n\n\u201cThe Venezuelan people suffer under corrupt politicians who tighten their grip on power while lining their own pockets. We are imposing costs on figures like Diosdado Cabello who exploit their official positions to engage in narcotics trafficking, money laundering, embezzlement of state funds, and other corrupt activities,\u201d Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin said at the time. \u201cThis Administration is committed to holding those accountable who violate the trust of the Venezuelan people, and we will continue to block attempts to abuse the U.S. financial system.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea and Venezuela have been close allies since the Ch\u00e1vez era. The head of North Korea\u2019s puppet legislature, Kim Yong Nam, visited Caracas most recently in November, signing several diplomatic agreements alongside Cabello. North Korea has used its state propaganda outlets to repeatedly denounce America as \u201csinister\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d for condemning Maduro\u2019s long list of human rights atrocities against his people. North Korean officials have also visited Venezuela to offer \u201cfinancial advice\u201d to the starving nation, despite North Korea\u2019s lamentable economic state.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Diosdado Cabello, the head of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) and U.S.-sanctioned cocaine trafficker, arrived in North Korea.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Canciller\u00eda-Venezuela-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
