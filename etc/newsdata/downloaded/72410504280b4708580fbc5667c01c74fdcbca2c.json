The key question is whether that weakness seeps through the economy, and whether that\u2019s aggravated.\u201d\n\nSince the Fed\u2019s 8-2 decision to cut rates in July, a move that Powell called a \u2018mid-cycle\u2019 adjustment, the economic data has delivered mixed signals.\n\nStrong retail sales and continued wage growth may add to Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren\u2019s confidence that current economic conditions do not justify further policy easing. He dissented in the July policy decision.\n\nThe ongoing U.S.-China trade war makes Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan among others concerned about slowing factory output and a slide in business investment. Kaplan supported July\u2019s rate cut.\n\n\u2018MIXED OPINION\u2019\n\nThe newest wild card to factor in to the debate emerged unexpectedly in Saturday\u2019s attacks on the Saudi oil facilities, which triggered the biggest spike in oil prices in more than two decades. [nL5N2674W4][nL5N2672I3]\n\nFed officials could see the development either as a risk to an already fragile growth outlook, which would support the case for more easing, or as a welcome boost to inflation, which would back a case for standing still for now.\n\nTraders of futures contracts tied to the Fed\u2019s policy rate were pricing in, as of Monday afternoon, a 65.8% chance that the central bank would cut its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 1.75% to 2% on Wednesday.\n\nAnd even though the conviction for further rate hikes has softened since last week, traders overall continue to expect one more reduction in borrowing costs by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cIf everyone was on the same page at the Fed I could understand it,\u201d said Lee Ferridge, head of macro strategy for North America at State Street Global Markets.\n\n\u201cBut clearly there is disagreement at the Fed ... If the Fed is very split and Powell can\u2019t give a strong signal, doesn\u2019t that imply very few moves are likely, rather than these dramatic cuts?\u201d\n\nFed policymakers will bring to the meeting their own views of where rates should be by December. In June, the last time they published their forecasts, about half of policymakers expected a total of two rate cuts this year; about half thought no rates would be appropriate.\n\nThat divide in the so-called Fed \u201cdot plot\u201d has borne little relation to how policy has actually shaped up, but it could add to confusion over the rate outlook after the conclusion of this week\u2019s meeting.\n\nWith more dovish policymakers like Bullard, Kashkari and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans calling for more easing, and more hawkish policymakers like Mester, Harker and Kansas City Fed President Esther George more skeptical, \u201cexpect the 2019 dots to reflect this mixed opinion,\u201d said Jefferies economist Ward McCarthy.", "description": "Deep disagreements within the Federal Reserve over the economic outlook and how the U.S. central bank should respond will not stop policymakers from cutting interest rates at a two-day meeting that begins on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Ann Saphir", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430740176&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G09K", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
