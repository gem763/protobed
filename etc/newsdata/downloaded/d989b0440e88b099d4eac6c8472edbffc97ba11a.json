Further, it calls for Trump to present a \"clear and specific plan for the enduring defeat of ISIS\".\n\nThe resolution is also expected to pass in the Senate, where top Republicans have offered rare criticism of Trump.\n\nTrump's decision \"is against all sound military advice,\" Senate Republican Lindsey Graham said on Wednesday.\n\nHe added that if the US president continues along this path, US \"foreign policy is in a very bad spot in the Middle East and to those who think the Mideast doesn't matter to America, remember 9/11 we had the same attitude on [September 10], 2001\".\n\nCongressional leaders to meet with Trump\n\nSeparate from the resolution, committees in the House and Senate are preparing legislation that would impose economic sanctions on Turkey if Erdogan does not cease its military operations against the Kurds.\n\nThose sanctions would go further than sanctions announced by Trump earlier this week.\n\n191016160457407\n\nMembers of Congress worry Trump's move will advantage Russia and Iran, which have supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and jeopardise the campaign ISIL, Hoyer said.\n\nTrump invited top congressional Democrats and Republicans to meet him at the White House on Wednesday. Top Democrats House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer were expected to attend along with Republicans Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nCongressional leaders said they expected Trump to try to explain his decision and offer details about how US forces will proceed in the region.\n\n'We are a fighting force'\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump disparaged the Kurds in remarks to reporters at a bilateral meeting with Italian Prime Minister Sergio Mattarella at the White House and said the US has no interest in the historic conflict between Kurds and Turkey.\n\n191014195833562\n\n\"They're no angels. They're no angels. Go back and take a look,\" Trump said of the Kurds.\n\nThe fighting now is \"between Turkey and Syria. It's not between Turkey and Syria and the United States,\" Trump said at a news conference with Mattarella. \"I want to bring our soldiers back home. We are not a police force. We are a fighting force.\"\n\nTurkey and Syria need to \"work out\" their border, he said. \"But we have got to get out of the endless wars.\"\n\nSmoke rises over the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, as seen from the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar, in Sanliurfa province, Turkey [Murad Sezer/Reuters]\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces group in northeast Turkey is led by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG).\n\nTurkey views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK, which Ankara and Washington consider a \"terrorist\" group, but the two countries diverge on the classification of the YPG.\n\nTrump on Wednesday said he believes PKK fighters are more dangerous than ISIL. He did not elaborate.\n\nTrump has dispatched National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien to Turkey to try to convince Erdogan to halt the military operation. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will travel to Ankara to meet with Erdogan, Trump said on Wednesday.\n\n191016063442043\n\nIn a speech to parliament, Erdogan said Turkey would not halt its operation until Kurdish forces withdraw but agreed to meet with the US diplomats after earlier saying he would not.\n\nIn Washington, DC, Mattarella voiced concerns of Turkey's European NATO allies.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned with Turkey's offensive in the northeastern part of Syria,\" Mattarella said through a translator.\n\nTurkey's assault has displaced civilians, caused casualties and is \"offering new space to ISIS and its criminal activities, not just in the Middle East, but in other countries around the world.\"\n\n\"We condemn what Turkey decided to do with no possible ambiguity,\" he said.", "description": "House passes nonbinding measure opposing Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from northeast Syria.", "authors": ["William Roberts"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/7/e277f8508eae49e4abe0e12cef56c6f0_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
