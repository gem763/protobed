Parama Purusha started creation and creation stemmed out of the acoustic root \u2018a\u2019.\n\nEnergy was also created. Here energy does not mean the Operative Principle. The Operative Principle is a binding faculty only and the style of functioning of the binding faculty is called \u2018svabhava\u2019, nature. Those who do not have deep knowledge of science may say that it is natural. But nature is simply the style of the Operative Principle, not an independent entity. When the Operative Principle works according to a particular style, that is, as per nature, the stamina that each and every phase gets is from energy. So energy is also created by the Cosmic Cognitive Faculty.\n\nEverything in the universe is supported by three fundamental sounds. Everything comes from cosmic bliss, that is, the composure of bliss. In this composure, the balance amongst the sentient, the mutative and static principle is maintained. When that balance gets upset, the flow comes from one of the vertices of the triangle of the forces. Force which comes out from one of the vertices is coming out from the sentient principle; that is, from the phase of the composure of bliss.\n\nSo everything starts with the sound and after starting its journey from the vertex, it has to move forward. For this, it requires energy. So first coming out from the sentient principle, \u2018sa\u2019 moves ahead with energy, that is, \u2018ra\u2019 the acoustic root of energy. And as soon as it starts movement, it acquires certain wonts, certain characteristics. The acoustic root for wonts for characteristics is \u2018va. So \u2018sa-ra-va\u2019 or \u2018sarva\u2019. Everything in this universe is known as sarva (in Sanskrit). Every entity is known as sarva.\n\nEnergy remains and maintains the structural solidarity of each and every entity by taking the form of its container, according to the structural solidarity of different entities. The same energy is operating through a ceiling fan or bulb or other expression, but do we ever see or feel it? Nobody can ever see energy and nobody can directly feel the presence of any energy, but everybody feels the presence of energy through its operation. Because of the function of the fan, we come to know that there is energy behind it. We get light from the bulb but we never see the energy. Energy is never seen or perceived but its effects are seen, perceived or felt.\n\nWe see the effect of energy functioning through different media but energy itself remains unseen. The Cognitive Principle is also just like energy. There is vital energy in your body, that is why you can speak, you can move or think. When there are no expressions from your corporal structure, you are described as being dead and gone. Similarly the same Cognitive Faculty functioning through different entities works as the subjective counterpart of their existences. Hence people can perceive and conceive its existence. The existence of God is conceived but cannot be perceived or expressed. Atma is not seen, perceived or conceived personally or collectively.\n\nCognitive Faculty is present not only in each and every figure but without a container also. It is not only all-pervading; it is also all-covering. That is why it is known as Vishnu.\n\n(October 21 is the Mahaprayan Divas of Shri Shri Anandamurti)", "description": "By Shri Shri Anandamurti Fundamentally, energy is \u2018one\u2019, but it has got several expressions and these are interchangeable.
