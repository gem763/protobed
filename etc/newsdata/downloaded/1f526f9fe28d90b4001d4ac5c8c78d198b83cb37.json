This is how we make it work.", "language": "en", "text": "The challenges\n\nShannon Page's office. Courtesy of Shannon Page\n\nI mentioned the finances: That's a big one for us. We're still trying to figure out how to manage the new federal tax bill; we got slammed at tax time this year, despite having made quarterly estimated payments. We're making much larger payments this year, and we also formed an S corporation. We're hoping that will help \u2026 we'll see.\n\nOne early challenge was work space. When I started freelancing, I lived alone, working at the dining room table. Once my husband moved in, that didn't really work anymore. I need uninterrupted silence to do my job, and the dining room was right in the middle of the house. Fortunately, not long afterward, he got that year-and-a-half-long gig; income from that allowed us to build me a \"tiny office\" in the backyard out of a toolshed.\n\nBeyond money and office space, you might think a big challenge of being your own boss is discipline: making yourself actually sit down and do the work.\n\nThat might be true for some freelancers, but we have the opposite problem. We have a terrible time making sure we have a day off. Even one a month \u2014 forget \"weekends.\"\n\nWhen we had day jobs, there was a clear demarcation between \"work\" and \"not work.\" When I was at work, I was on their time, and everyone knew it. When I went home, even though I might think about the job, it was clear that I was on my own time. I did laundry or worked on my novel or went out to a movie or napped or whatever.\n\nNow? Work and home are in the same place, and my time is fluid, mine to manage \u2014 or mismanage. If everything is going as it should, there is always work to do. (I'm writing this article on a Saturday, in fact.) Where it gets confusing is in figuring out what is supposed to happen in each hour. I always left my day job with work unfinished at the end of my shift, just because it was time to go home. Not only that, but everyone else was leaving then, too \u2014 their departure helped enforce mine. The work would be there tomorrow.\n\nThat's a lot less clear now. \"Time to go to work\" is always now; \"time to go home\" is \u2026 never defined. I like my work \u2014 as I am fond of telling people, \"I get paid to read books all day\" \u2014 but the fact remains that it is, actually, still work. And yet it's always right here, at my house. Do I stop \u2014 in an hour? Three hours? Tomorrow for sure? Or only when the next imperative interrupts?\n\nI don't really know how to take a whole day off anymore. To just \u2026 laze around. Lie on the couch reading a book for fun, like I did on weekends back in the olden days. I just want to finish this job, I think. Turn it in and invoice it.\n\nAnd there's always another job after that.\n\nWhich is good! I do really like it, and it keeps us from starving. But it would be healthier if we could figure out how to strike a better balance.", "description": "Shannon Page became a full-time freelancer in 2009, and hasn't looked back.
