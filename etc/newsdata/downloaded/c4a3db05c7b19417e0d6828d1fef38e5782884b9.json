The growing proportion of gas within Senex's total sales meant September quarter revenues of $23.9 million were below estimates, he said.\n\nShares in Senex were down 1.4 per cent at 34.5\u00a2 just after midday.\n\nMeanwhile, larger producer Beach Energy reported a marginal increase in its realised gas price in the September quarter, up 1 per cent to $7.10 a gigajoule. Sales for the quarter were down 13 per cent, however, from the June quarter as production and sales volumes slipped, due to the sale of a 49 per cent interest in the Otway gas project in Victoria and lower output at the BassGas venture.\n\nBeach said the September quarter performance represented a \"positive start\" to 2019-20, with oil production in the Western Flank part of the Cooper Basin up 9 per cent. Sales were $438 million on production of 6.55 million barrels of oil equivalent, down 6 per cent from the June quarter.\n\nBeach managing director Matt Kay described initial results from the Dombey-1 gas discovery made this month in the South Australian Otway Basin as \"encouraging\" and said testing would take place for commercial production.\n\nNext on the exploration front for Beach are the Black Watch and Enterprise wells, due to start this quarter on the Victorian coast, ahead of an offshore drilling campaign next year.\n\nThe activity comes as gas market watchers keenly await progress at the biggest chunk of undeveloped gas on the east coast, the Arrow Energy gas in the Surat Basin, amid doubts that owners Shell and PetroChina will go ahead with the development as targeted by the year-end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"While Arrow is working towards a FID [final investment decision] for the SGP [Surat Gas Project] before the end of 2019, this is ultimately a matter for Arrow\u2019s shareholders,\" an Arrow spokesman said.\n\nSeparately, Beach announced an onshore Western Australia gas discovery at the Beharra Springs Deep-1 well. where it is partnered by Japanese trader Mitsui.\n\nThe find extends a run of drilling successes in the Perth Basin, including the West Erregulla-2 find by Strike Energy and Warrego Energy in August and the earlier Waitsia discovery, also owned by Beach and Mitsui.\n\nThe Beharra Springs Deep-1 well found gas over 65 metres, of which the \"net gas pay\" \u2013 the part that could be commercially produced \u2013 is 36 metres.\n\nShares in Beach were up 2.6 per cent at $2.41 by early afternoon.", "description": "Senex is nearing the start of deliveries from Queensland's first gas project reserved for domestic users but questions remain over the fate of the larger Arrow venture.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a2c590fd5316746f843b0115a2ca638f739e147c", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
