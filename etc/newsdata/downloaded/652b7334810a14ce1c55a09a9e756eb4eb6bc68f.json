Despite predictable opposition from the Liberal Party, the bill passed with support from the Greens.\n\nThe landmark bill will come into effect from January 31st, 2020 and will apply to all ACT residents over the age of 18.\n\nInterestingly enough, the legislation presents some strange and conflicting challenges for residents.\n\nREAD MORE Nothing Brings Me Inner Peace Like Nerds On YouTube Skillfully Doing Extreme Nerd Shit\n\nFor starters, the possession of cannabis remains outlawed under Commonwealth law, however it remains unlikely that the bill will be challenged by Federal lawmakers, meaning it has a fair chance to be freely applied in the ACT without Commonwealth interference or overruling.\n\nSecondly, while the legislation legalises personal marijuana use, possession, and cultivation, the sale and distribution of weed will remain a crime in the ACT, meaning it\u2019s not exactly clear how the law expects people to obtain the weed in the first place.\n\nFinally, police officials have bafflingly warned that the simple act of passing a joint at a party would still be considered a crime in the ACT, as it technically constitutes supply.\n\nRegardless, the legalisation of weed for personal use is a huge step forward given the vehement resistance from the rest of Australia\u2019s lawmakers.\n\nHell yeah, ACT!
