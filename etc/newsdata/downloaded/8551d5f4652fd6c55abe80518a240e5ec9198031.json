Martin and Charles Robinson select games this week that will leave us buzzing heading into Monday.\n\nPaylor\u2019s must-watch\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles at Dallas Cowboys\n\nOne of these teams will be in a world of hurt after this game, as both are currently 3-3 after entering the season with big expectations. Their fan bases are concerned, and with both clubs in large media markets, the loser is going to be ripped to shreds locally for a week afterward.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSo yes, both teams are playing for their sanity, and adding an extra layer of intensity to this is Doug Pederson's \"guarantee,\" which he walked back with reporters but his original words definitely reached the Cowboys\u2019 locker room. So the damage is already done.\n\nIf Philly wins, their coach's confidence will be a rallying point. If Dallas wins, Pederson's \"disrespect\" will be a rallying point. Expect the locker room interviews after this one to be as interesting as the game itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin\u2019s must-watch\n\nLos Angeles Rams at Atlanta Falcons\n\nThe Rams and Falcons haven\u2019t looked the same since losing in their respective Super Bowl appearances, and both teams are desperate for a win. The difference is there\u2019s reason for some optimism with the Rams.\n\nHaving finally escaped purgatory \u2014 otherwise known as Jacksonville \u2014 cornerback Jalen Ramsey is free to wreak havoc again on the football field. It\u2019s amazing how a trade to the West Coast has suddenly improved his back \u201cinjury,\u201d right?\n\nStory continues\n\nYou may not even realize it, but the Rams have only one more win than Ramsey\u2019s former team. But the expectations for Sean McVay\u2019s squad are considerably higher now that the chatty corner has been added to their collection of stars. Ramsey\u2019s presence won\u2019t sort out the Rams\u2019 offensive line issues, nor will it improve Jared Goff\u2019s passer rating (80.8) and touchdown-to-interception ratio (7:7). But he\u2019s expected to inject some much-needed life into a team that has lost three straight for the first time under McVay.\n\nMeanwhile, it seems the Falcons have found every conceivable way to lose. Their latest defeat came at the hands \u2014 or, uh, feet \u2014 of kicker Matt Bryant, who missed the game-tying extra point last week against Arizona. The Falcons have lost four in a row and are near the bottom of the league in pass defense (27th) and points allowed (31st) per game. Head coach Dan Quinn has received the public support of the team owner thus far. But if Atlanta loses a fifth straight, should he?\n\nRobinson\u2019s must-watch\n\nEagles at Cowboys\n\nIn most circumstances, I\u2019d never suggest a matchup of 3-3 teams is the game to lock into. But this one has too much on the line to ignore.\n\nIt\u2019s for the lead in the NFC East and might factor as a tiebreaker down the line \u2014 which is important because it\u2019s possible that the division winner is the lone playoff qualifier. Beyond that, Cowboys coach Jason Garrett is already under considerable heat and a loss heading into a Week 8 bye would set up an absolutely brutal two-week media gauntlet. It feels like the Cowboys have already reached a tipping point of sorts and there is a tough slate left on the schedule.\n\nThe Eagles aren\u2019t in much better shape, although they\u2019re going to get some injured players back soon, so there\u2019s at least a light at the end of the tunnel. That said, Philadelphia\u2019s season has been a bitter pill so far, especially in light of the overall strength of the roster coming out of training camp.\n\nWithout a doubt, one fan base is going to be irate coming out of this one. That alone is worth the watch in this brutal rivalry.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Cowboys or Eagles fans will walk away angry with a loss on Sunday night.
