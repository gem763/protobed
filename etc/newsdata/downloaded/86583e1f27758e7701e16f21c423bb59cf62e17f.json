At 15, as a refugee, he boarded an illegal boat for Palestine.\n\nThere he fought in the War of Independence and witnessed the birth of the new State of Israel.\n\nThe surviving members of his family had moved to Sydney and he missed them. At the age of 21, he joined them.\n\nBefore his 30th birthday, he and fellow Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9, John Saunders, had founded Westfield and taken it public.\n\nSir Frank always said he would retire at the age of 60 but as that approached, he pushed it out to 65. Thereafter, he set no date.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt 80, he shifted from executive to non-executive chairman of Westfield and remained so until the company was sold to the French commercial real-estate company Unibail Rodamco for $33 billion.\n\nIn December 2017, at an investiture at Windsor Castle, he was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the Queen\u2019s Birthday Honours List.\n\nSir Frank puts his success down to never giving up.\n\n\u201cThe word \u2018no\u2019 is not for me.
