Given the Taliban\u2019s targeting of an American service member and civilians, the talks are \u201cdead as far as I'm concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that with me.\u201d Among the problems with this narrative is that it concerned a militant group that the Trump administration has bargained persistently with through 15 previous killings of American soldiers this year alone. The Taliban has killed and wounded thousands of U.S. troops over the past couple of decades. According to the latest statistics, it was responsible for three-fourths of deaths from terrorist attacks in Afghanistan, and one-fifth of terrorism-related deaths worldwide, in 2017. \u201cWhat kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position?\u201d the president inquired on Saturday. Precisely the kind of noxious folks, as Trump must know, whom his negotiators have been huddling with in Qatar for more than a year now.\n\nIn truth, Trump\u2019s cancellation of the Camp David meeting and suspension of peace talks reflect a reality that was evident well before a bomb detonated near the vehicle of Sergeant First Class Elis Barreto Ortiz: The peace process and proposed agreement rest on an exceedingly shaky foundation. The writing for this move was on the wall, and this weekend the president essentially tweeted it out. The latest bout of bloodshed may have played some role in the actions Trump just took, but it is also a convenient out for an administration that had gone all in on a floundering initiative.\n\nOne of the expectations of any pact, for example, was that the Taliban would not only disown al-Qaeda, but also guarantee that its territory wouldn\u2019t be used by jihadists to launch attacks against the United States. It\u2019s far from clear that the Taliban would have been willing or able to enforce that condition, especially once the U.S. military fully withdraws from the country. Senior al-Qaeda figures are thought to be hiding out along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, where the Taliban is effectively a major power. As of this summer\u2014mere months before Americans apparently came close to seeing Taliban leaders at the president\u2019s storied country getaway in the run-up to September 11 commemorations\u2014United Nations Security Council reports were describing the Taliban as the \u201cprimary partner\u201d of al-Qaeda and all other foreign terrorist groups operating in Afghanistan except the Islamic State, and Afghanistan as a \u201ccontinuing safe haven\u201d for al-Qaeda\u2019s leadership.", "description": "The latest bout of bloodshed may have played some role in the actions Trump just took, but it is also a convenient out for an administration that had gone all in on a floundering initiative.", "authors": ["Uri Friedman", "Kathy Gilsinan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19248364713929/facebook.jpg?1568048911", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
