Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., listens during questioning at a House Oversight and Reform committee hearing on facial recognition technology in government, Tuesday, June 4, 2019, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nA new ad from California Republican Elizabeth Heng\u2019s \u201cNew Faces GOP\u201d PAC that ran Thursday night during the Democratic debate has got people talking.\n\nThe ad, which was broadcast on a local ABC affiliate in the Washington, DC area, portrayed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) as the \u201cface of socialism.\u201d It\u2019s what happened next in the ad that outraged AOC and her online sycophants:\n\nA dramatic ad targeting Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez aired during the third Democratic debate on Thursday, comparing Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s support for democratic socialism to the brutal Khmer Rouge communist regime in Cambodia.\n\n\n\nThe ad shows a picture of the young congresswoman bursting into flame to reveal a picture of a pile of skulls. The narrator of the ad, onetime Republican congressional candidate Elizabeth Heng, is the daughter of Cambodian immigrants.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the face of socialism and ignorance,\u201d Heng says in a voiceover as the picture of Ocasio-Cortez burns. \u201cDoes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez know the horror of socialism?\u201d\n\nWatch the full 30 second ad below:\n\nWe have a choice: Will we let socialists like @AOC be the face of our future? Or will a new generation of conservatives step up & lead us? We're launching New Faces GOP to help identify & support the next generation of GOP leaders.

Life is weird! \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 13, 2019\n\nThe next day, the self-described \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d continued to play the race card against Heng \u2013 who is not white:\n\nKnow that this wasn\u2019t an ad for young conservatives of color \u2013 that was the pretense. What you just watched was a love letter to the GOP\u2019s white supremacist case. https://t.co/zvp1EB02c5 \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 13, 2019\n\nNot only is Heng the daughter of Cambodian immigrants (which kinda disqualifies her from the white supremacy club), but the ad was paid for by Heng\u2019s PAC, not any elected GOP official.\n\nBut AOC wasn\u2019t done. Next on her list of people or things to sic her digital lynch mob on was Sinclair Broadcasting:\n\nGOP\u2019s message: No policy, no facts, just displays of violence + corporations like @ABCNetwork & Sinclair who amplify them. They profit from burning my likeness on TV. But who pays for heightened security? Who answers the phones for the threats resulting from a violent, false ad? https://t.co/Gr1XhEbwDC \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 13, 2019\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s meltdown was largely responsible for the #BoycottABC hashtag that has trended on Twitter today.\n\nBut if the leader of the so-called \u201cSquad\u201d thought her Twitter rant was going to get Heng to back down, she was wrong:\n\nNot Republicans. Me. Are you really calling me a racist @aoc? I\u2019m calling all Democrats out for supporting an evil ideology. Or are you just in Congress to hang out with celebrities and tweet out ridiculous ideas like the green new deal? https://t.co/w985LYjIZd \u2014 Elizabeth Heng (@ElizabethHeng) September 13, 2019\n\nLater, Heng made it clear to AOC that facts don\u2019t care about your feelings:\n\n.@aoc response is the Democratic party in a nutshell. They are more offended by truthful words than the acts of their political ideology that has killed millions of innocent victims. I don't care about @AOC feelings \u2013 I care about stopping her lies about the lies of socialism. \u2014 Elizabeth Heng (@ElizabethHeng) September 13, 2019\n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not lost on the people reading this who have kept up with Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s frequent unhinged rants against her critics that she is the last person in this country who should be complaining about provocative comparisons to evil regimes. To this day, the woman who compared detention centers for illegal immigrants to concentration camps still believes what the United States is doing at the southern border is no different than what took place in Nazi Germany.\n\nBeyond the bogus accusations of racism and white supremacy, what the freshman Democratic Congressman willfully ignored was the real point behind the ad:\n\nThe take-away is a minority female knows firsthand how Socialism kills. But a picture was burned, so forget that. https://t.co/KSkPpMJ15g \u2014 A.P.

They did it to her before when she ran for Congress last year in what Red State\u2019s streiff speculated at the time was more about \u201cinterfer[ing] in a federal election campaign\u201d than an innocent attempt at shielding Facebook users from sensitive imagery.\n\nStay tuned.\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\n\u2014 Based in North Carolina, Sister Toldjah is a former liberal and a 15+ year veteran of blogging with an emphasis on media bias, social issues, and the culture wars.
