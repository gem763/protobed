The Irish were ranked No. 1 heading into the Rugby World Cup in Japan.\n\nFor the first time his name was linked with the All Blacks head coaching role which will become available when Steve Hansen steps down after the current tournament. Until now Ireland\u2019s Joe Schmidt, Wales\u2019 Warren Gatland and even Scotland\u2019s Vern Cotter were perceived as stronger candidates.\n\nBut just as New Zealand began to pay court to Joseph he appeared to rebuff their advances. According to media reports, he is close to signing a contract extension with Japan Rugby, ruling him out of contention for the All Blacks\u2019 job at least in the near future.\n\nIt may be that because he was coaching a \u201cTier Two\u201d nation he wasn\u2019t seen immediately as All Black coaching material. Japan\u2019s unbeaten start to the World Cup - it\u2019s wins over Russia, Ireland and Samoa in Pool A - have caused many to revise that view.\n\nJoseph\u2019s resume shows an almost unique collection of qualifications.\n\nAs a player he was an All Black - a member of New Zealand\u2019s 1995 World Cup squad - and a New Zealand Maori representative. Later he played 10 tests for Japan, appearing at the 1999 World Cup. He made 86 appearances for Otago province, winning a National Provincial Championship title in 1991.\n\nAs a coach, he guided the Highlanders to their first Super Rugby title and New Zealand Maori to two international wins over England. He took charge of the Japan national team in 2016 in the wake of the Eddie Jones era and its development has been his masterwork.\n\nJoseph now finds himself a victim of his own success. Until this World Cup, Japan rugby fans accepted any win over a Tier One nation with surprise and gratitude; now they\u2019re expected to win.\n\n\u201cNo one thought we could beat Ireland and now they think we can win every game we play. That\u2019s how silly it is,\u201d Joseph said after Japan\u2019s win over Samoa\n\nThe qualities Joseph has shown as Japan coach - clarity of purpose, loyalty, defiance of norms and acceptance of underdog status - are likely developments of his own playing career.\n\nJoseph was born into a prominent New Zealand rugby family. His father, Jim, was a prop in the Marlborough provincial team that held the Ranfurly Shield, New Zealand\u2019s premier challenge trophy, for two seasons in the early 1970s.\n\nHe may have been too young to appreciate the achievement at the time, as tiny Marlborough took on and defeated much larger and more powerful provinces. But it must have become part of family lore and helped hone a sense of the potential of the underdog.\n\nJoseph displayed talent at an early age and was quickly selected for the Otago provincial team after moving to that South Island city to study at University.\n\nThe ethos of Otago province runs deeply through his coaching style - an emphasis on strong forward play and sound basics alloyed to a delight in expressive back play.\n\nThat may come from the two elements of Dunedin city and Otago province - the land and the university. Pride in the land gives Otago a sense of separateness from the rest of New Zealand, of simple values, while the university brings exuberance, defiance of norms.\n\nAt the same time Joseph has always followed his own course. He played 20 tests for the All Blacks but left New Zealand aged only 25 to play in Japan. He has never looked back.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For Japan rugby coach Jamie Joseph, recognition and expectation arrived at about the same time and in equal measure.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Mcmorran"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
