Just not as great as An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez.", "language": "en", "text": "Mikolas has helped buoy the Cardinals, though they are down 1-0 and must face Nationals ace Max Scherzer on Saturday. The Cardinals, though, would gladly accept six innings of one-run ball from every starter for the rest of the playoffs.\n\nThe lone run Mikolas gave up came after he made a mistake to Yan Gomes in the second inning, who lined a double to score Howie Kendrick.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMikolas tried to keep Nationals hitters honest by deceiving them. \u201c[If] there\u2019s one place in my life where I like to be deceiving and deceitful, it\u2019s out there on the mound,\u201d he said. \u201cI do my best to hide the ball. Fastballs in and keep them off [the plate] with the breaking stuff.\u201d\n\nFor much of the first six innings, Nationals hitters looked like they couldn\u2019t pick up Mikolas\u2019s pitches. In the first, he threw an 80-mph curveball that Juan Soto was so far out in front of he could have pulled his bat back and swung again. In the fifth, Adam Eaton must have thought one of those slow curves was coming because he didn\u2019t even flinch at a 93-mph fastball as it sailed through the zone.\n\n\u201cI had a rough regular season,\u201d said the 31-year-old Mikolas, who posted a 9-14 record and 4.16 ERA. \u201cI\u2019m doing my best to make up for it in the postseason.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMikolas worked with three pitches \u2014 a fastball in the low 90s, a slider in the mid 80s and a curve that hung around at 80 and sometimes dropped as low as 76. He tried to never throw them in the same place twice.\n\n\u201cIn, out, up, down, slow, fast, mix up the speeds, move the ball,\u201d he said.\n\nManager Mike Shildt praised Mikolas\u2019s effort and said he made just one mistake \u2014 leaving a fastball up to Gomes that became an RBI double.\n\n\u201cIn command of his pitches, the ball was going where he wanted to,\u201d Shildt said. \u201c[He] pitched six innings, give up one run against a good offensive club, gave us more than a chance. I thought he was terrific.\u201d\n\nIn part because of Mikolas\u2019s strong effort, Shildt beat back questions about going down 1-0, nearly being no hit and having to face a tough starting rotation from Washington. He bristled at a question suggesting that the team needed to shake-up its lineup after getting only one hit.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to knee jerk with one game when we just got through winning a series. And we have gotten to this point with the group that we have, with guys that have taken good at-bats,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead of overreacting to one game, he said the team would keep using the same lineup.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s complete hope,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cIt\u2019s baseball, it\u2019s one of the reasons we love it. We scored 13 in an elimination game and came right back and the guy threw a great game. But there\u2019s nothing but optimism about all our players and our offense, for sure. We\u2019ll be ready to go tomorrow.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "To be the losing pitcher when an opponent dominates is to get no credit at all.", "authors": ["Matt Crossman"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UzTJP7C3Le0FYMpBJeOr7i3QtiA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NNY5XJXMSEI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
