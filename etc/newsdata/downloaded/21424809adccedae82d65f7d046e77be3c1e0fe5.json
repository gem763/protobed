They will get their wish once the legislation receives the queen\u2019s approval.\n\nThat will set the stage for another battle: whether, and when, to hold a general election.\n\nThe expected success of the legislation is due in no small part to the decision last week by 21 members of Mr. Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party to defy him on the question of whether to leave without a deal. They were expelled from the party for their defiance.\n\nThe Tory revolt against Mr. Johnson, and his ruthless purging of the rebels, have reverberated through British politics, threatening his hold on power.", "description": "Legislation to prevent a no-deal Brexit is expected to gain formal approval today, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson is likely to be rebuffed in his second try for a general election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/world/09brexit-briefing1/merlin_160177842_b22b4c6e-4d34-40ef-9232-53c6e2b1728c-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
