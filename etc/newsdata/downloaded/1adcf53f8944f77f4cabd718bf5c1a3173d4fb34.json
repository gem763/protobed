I want people to understand that there is nothing that should limit your pursuit of your dreams, and the accomplishment of new goals. You can create your own lanes, just as I am. The state bar doesn't care who you are.\n\n'This option is available to anyone whose state allows it. It's true I did not finish college. You need 60 college credits (I had 75) to take part in 'reading the law', which is an in office law school being apprenticed by lawyers. For anyone assuming this is the easy way out, it's not.'", "description": "Taking to Instagram to mark the occasion, the star, 39,  gushed that her 'heart was so happy' to learn that Kanye made the donation as a present from him and their four children.", "authors": ["Laura Fox For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/09/20027032-0-image-a-36_1571734014626.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
