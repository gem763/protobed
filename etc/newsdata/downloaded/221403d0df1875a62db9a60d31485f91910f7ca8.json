Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is speaking out following a Friday campaign event where she laughed after a voter asked how she would respond to President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cmentally retarded actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy that argument that impeachment doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said an audience member at her New Hampshire event. \u201cThere needs to be accountability. What are you going to do in the next one year to diminish the mentally retarded actions of this guy?\u201d\n\nAs supporters laughed and cheered the man\u2019s question, Harris gave a chuckle, adding, \u201cWell said, well said.\u201d\n\n\u201cI plan to win this election, I\u2019ll tell you that,\u201d the 2020 hopeful replied.\n\nDuring a rally, a voter referred to Trump's actions as \"mentally retarded\", prompting @KamalaHarris to laugh and say, \"well said, well said.\"\n\n\n\nI hate amplifying content I know the right will seize on and twist for their own hypocritical gain, but this hurts my heart. #CripTheVote pic.twitter.com/aVQWtLFw30 \u2014 Kendally Brown (@kendallybrown) September 7, 2019\n\nFootage of the exchange quickly began circulating Twitter, where some users criticized Harris\u2019 response as hurtful.\n\nOn Saturday, Harris addressed the matter in an interview with CBS News, calling the word \u201cretarded\u201d an \u201cincredibly offensive term\u201d and emphasizing her \u201clongstanding relationship with advocacy for our disability community.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would think that in the year 2019 people would have a much better understanding of how hurtful a term like that can be, but also the history behind it, which is a history of really ignoring the needs and the realities and the capacity of our disability community,\u201d she said.\n\nYesterday, someone at a @KamalaHarris event called Pres. Trump \u201cmentally retarded.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe 2020 candidate told @CHueyBurns the term is \u201cincredibly offensive\u201d and said in 2019 you would think \"people would have a much better understanding of how hurtful a term like that can be.\" pic.twitter.com/01amMnkaqi \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) September 7, 2019\n\nPressed on her missed opportunity to publicly condemn the man\u2019s language during the event, Harris claimed she hadn\u2019t heard his full statement, paying attention only to an earlier part of his remarks.\n\n\u201cI heard him talk about the other stuff, and then that came later and it was not something that I really heard or processed or in any way condone,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s for sure.\u201d", "description": "The Democratic presidential candidate is speaking out about the incident, saying she didn't hear the man's full statement.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d74144d2300001d0351273d.jpeg?cache=dgypdw4o5m&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
