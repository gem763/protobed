Dillon said Brando, who died in 2004, used to ask his dad whether the bike was \u201cserviced and ready to go?\u201d\n\nThe fact that the scooter was not registered for U.K. roads did not stop Brando, one of the 20th Century\u2019s most acclaimed actors. The Piaggo Vespa 125cc Turismo Speciale is unrestored and still bears the original number plate from Rome.\n\nAuctioneers estimate the scooter, which has become a vintage collector\u2019s item, will sell for between \u00a32,000 to \u00a33,000 ($2,500 to $3,800).
