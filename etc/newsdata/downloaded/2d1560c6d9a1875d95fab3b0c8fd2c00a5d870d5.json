In a separate video, students ran for their lives after spotting the gunman in the hallway.\n\nWOMAN CLAIMS DAUGHTER REMAIN WERE DESECRATED AFTER OREGON CEMETERY CRACKED OPEN CASKET\n\n\u201cI walk in there, I get to the classroom, I\u2019m in the classroom for 15, 20 seconds - you know, I ask the teacher, \u2018Is the student here?'\u201d Lowe told KOIN. \u201cThe door opens - I\u2019m within arm\u2019s length of the door, about 3 feet away from the door, and there\u2019s a kid with a gun, a shotgun. In a fraction of a second, I analyzed everything really fast.\"\n\nInstead of lashing out, Lowe embraces the confused teenager and they are seen hugging in the hallway for at least a minute. Granados-Diaz attempts to break from his embrace at one point before Lowe pulls him back in and continues to hold him tight.\n\n\"Then it was just me and that student. It was a real emotional time. It was emotional for him, it was emotional for me,\" Lowe said back in May, according to KATU. \"In that time, I felt compassion for him. A lot of times, especially when you\u2019re young, you don\u2019t realize what you\u2019re doing until it\u2019s over.\"\n\nGranados-Diaz had been suffering from a mental health breakdown at the time and was intending on killing himself, according to the Oregonian. The teenager was distraught and lonely over a recent breakup with his girlfriend and that didn't want to kill himself at home, because he didn't want his mother finding his body, according to the outlet.\n\nCALIFORNIA GIRL, 10, COMMITS SUICIDE; POLICE INVESTIGATING WHETHER BULLYING TO BLAME\n\nHis lawyer said that Granados-Diaz planned on ending his life in a school bathroom before deciding to go into a classroom with the hope it would increase the chances of someone calling 911 after he fired his shotgun.\n\nLowe was informed of the possible danger after a student reported Granados-Diaz had been making suicidal statements, which led Lowe to the classroom the teenager was in.\n\nFollowing the incident, Granados-Diaz pleaded guilty to felony possession of a firearm in a public building and misdemeanor possession of a loaded firearm in public. He was sentenced to three years of probation on Oct. 17 and will receive any type of mental health treatment he needs in the future.\n\nCLICK FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nLowe played football at the University of Oregon from 2011-2014 as a wide receiver.
