Photo by Hunter Barnes.\n\nOutside of Life: Lowriders, Coolers, Bikers & Bloods is a photo book by Hunter Barnes that was initially self-published in 2003. It spotlights fringe American communities and spans regional motorcycle clubs, car clubs, gangs in St. Louis, and California State inmates. Barnes united these disparate groups at the turn of the 21st century as a set of compelling subjects. Now, nearly 15 years later, the black and white photos will be shown in an exhibition at David Hill Gallery in London through December 20.\n\nFor Barnes, the subjects of the series were magnetic because of their remoteness from the American mainstream and making these images required a great deal of trust. \u201cOutside of Life\u201d was shot on film, both because he describes himself as \u201cold-school\u201d and because analogue fits nicely with his slow-cook approach. His series was shot before the arrival of Instagram, but his body of work as a whole seems to refute the digital age and its impulsive values. As a result, his patience delivers a potent form of testimony.\n\nThe American photographer\u2019s projects since 2003 have varied\u2014years spent with the Nez Perce tribe, months with a serpent-handling congregation in the Appalachian Mountains, a dicey mission amongst the Tamil people in Sri Lanka\u2014but are underpinned by a desire to explore communal identity. Barnes discussed his fidelity to analogue photography, his experiences, and why showing up to introduce yourself\u2014in person\u2014inevitably gets you in the door.\n\nLowrider, Espanola, Chimayo, New Mexico, 2003. Photo by Hunter Barnes.\n\nHow did these four series from \u201cOutside of Life\" come together?\n\nIt was a year on the road; I was in my early/mid 20s. I went pretty hard, fast\u2026 at that time, I barely had money to process the film\u2014I don't even know how I pulled the project off! I slept in cars, or people let me stay in their places. I didn't even have contact sheets made back then\u2014I still don\u2019t, for some of the work. I started shooting photographs of friends of mine who were bikers. That same year, I ended up out in the desert because I\u2019d heard about the low riders out there\u2014Espa\u00f1ola in Chimay\u00f3, New Mexico is a low-riding capital. I went on this trip and was blown away. I thought those two would fit. And then somehow, naturally, I was introduced to a guy who was in the Bloods\u2026 and I shot in California State prison because some people from the Bloods landed there. I ended up getting access to the yard.\n\nWhen you say you had a natural introduction to the Bloods\u2026 what do you mean?\n\nA friend of mine was taking photos for different hip hop record covers; he knew some of those guys. I told him about this book I was doing. He said, \u2018You\u2019re going to have to come to the neighborhood and introduce yourself.\u2019\n\n#5, California State Prison, 2003. Photo by Hunter Barnes.\n\nWhat happens after that introduction? Your series are usually immersive and happen over several years\u2026 Do you do research, or is it intuitive? What is that negotiation between feeling part of a community versus maintaining enough distance to document it?\n\nIt\u2019s a responsibility to understand who the subject is and, at the same time, that they understand what you are doing. If you want to portray somebody in the right way that\u2019s honest, you need to know who they are and where they\u2019re from. But they have to trust you\u2014they wouldn't let you do what I do if they don't trust you\u2014for them to be comfortable and take me to the right place. It is a long process.\n\nWhen I first started, I would take a box of prints so I could show \u2018em what I was doing. That way they can see the work. I\u2019ll ask them when\u2019s a good time to be there\u2014once everybody\u2019s agreed to it\u2014to come back in town and actually plan it out. As far as researching ahead of time, I don't do a ton of it. Back then, I didn't do any at all. In 2003, you weren't really on the internet. It was people I met and gut feeling. Still to this day: a little bit of research is good, just as far as navigating around a little, but you don't really want too much if you wanna get the real thing\u2014people will show you what that is. It\u2019s almost going in with a preconceived notion if you\u2019ve done too much research. I feel like once you make friends, you\u2019re down with everybody, and they have an understanding, they\u2019ll open up that side of their life that you\u2019re supposed to be exposed to. I like meeting people that way. I\u2019m old-school in a lot of things. I show up on time. I still stop at gas stations and ask for directions when I\u2019m on the road. Developing relationships takes time, and the process does too because everything I shoot is on film. There\u2019s something about it: there\u2019s a spirit and soul to it. The projects, I would say, from start to finish, are usually about two years.\n\nBooty Man, East St. Louis, Missouri, 2003. Photo by Hunter Barnes.\n\nHow did you decide to become a photographer? Who influenced your eye or aesthetic?\n\nA cousin of mine was a photographer and exposed me to a camera. The original influence was 60s-70s psychedelic artists, like Rick Griffin. They were doing everything that they wanted, putting out there what they were really seeing and feeling. When I went to school, I trained in photochemistry. I didn't go to art school; what I was learning was very technical. I moved to New York after and became a photo assistant. I worked for some cool people in a commercial industry, and I wasn't feeling that that was what I wanted to do. I met a girl, and fell in love with her, and went out to very small town where she was from. Those were some of the first art patrons of mine. They gave me places to live, cabins out in the mountains, with barns that I could print in. I had whole buildings for my art. I did my first book when I was 22; it was called Redneck Roundup. It was all these old-timer ranchers and hillbillies. It hit me that these people weren't going to be around much longer\u2014the kids who were going to inherit the ranches had zero desire to become farmers. I saw them fading out, and asked if anyone had ever documented their lives. No one had\u2014so I moved out there to do that project. That\u2019s how it started.\n\nJoey, New York, 2003. Photo by Hunter Barnes.\n\nDo you feel your ability to infiltrate different communities has changed over time\u2014especially since the way people consider photography as a medium has changed?\n\nPeople always say I infiltrate these places\u2026 I\u2019ve never looked at it like that. I\u2019ve introduced myself, and they\u2019ve invited me into their home. It\u2019s an extension of being invited into somebody\u2019s life and into their world. I\u2019m always grateful for that. I just got off the road for a project I\u2019m not telling people about yet, but I was nervous because didn't know anyone in the community. It\u2019s really a sensitive place; people really had to trust me to do this. I came with my books and introduced myself in person\u2014I initially emailed someone, and that didn't fly. So the approach hasn't changed. And people are intrigued that it\u2019s all being shot on film. A couple people were like: \u2018When can I see the pictures?\u2019 And I was like \u2018Well\u2026 I shot 60-something rolls; it\u2019s got to be processed.\u2019 And I need to not look at it for a month or so, because otherwise you get emotionally attached to certain images. Also, because people have cell phones now, I was worried they\u2019d just be looking on their phones, but they didn\u2019t. I kept my own phone away the whole time.\n\nPolo, East St. Louis, Missouri, 2003. Photo by Hunter Barnes.\n\nYou\u2019re described as a documentary photographer\u2014would you qualify this as different than a portraitist? Given that you build and cultivate these relationships, it seems less neutral than documentary.\n\nI have a degree and know about photography, but I\u2019d never heard the words \u2018documentary photographer\u2019 until someone said: \u2018You\u2019re a documentary photographer.\u2019 Shit, I guess I am! Alright! It was something that just kind of happened. I guess it doesn't really matter, but you\u2019re right\u2014I do take portraits of people primarily. There are very few photographs that don't have somebody in them. And I\u2019ve always wanted the subject to feel right about it. You can spend a month with somebody, and then all of a sudden, one day it\u2019s the time to do it. You end up taking a few frames, less than a roll of film\u2026 You can feel, mutually, that you got what you were supposed to. The way somebody feels about the image is very, very important to me\u2014I would never want to be the type of person taking a photo of a picture of somebody when they don't know what my intentions are and what I\u2019m doing.\n\n#2, California State Prison, 2003.
