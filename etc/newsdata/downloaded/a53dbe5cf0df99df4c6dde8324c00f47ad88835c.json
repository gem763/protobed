These Sections Will Receive the Most Scrutiny", "language": "en", "text": "The whistleblower complaint detailing concerns over President Donald Trump\u2019s July phone call with the Ukrainian president alleges that the President \u201cis using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the July phone call, the complaint, which was released by the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday morning, details an alleged effort by White House officials to keep records of the call secret and efforts to follow up with Ukrainian officials about the call. The whistleblower described the President\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as a \u201ccentral figure\u201d in the effort to pressure Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election, and that Attorney General William Barr \u201cappears to be involved.\u201d (Giuliani has defended his work and denied wrongdoing while the Department of Justice has denied that Barr has communicated with Ukraine).\n\nIn the complaint, the whistleblower said that he or she did not hear the phone call personally, but that about a dozen White House officials had listened to the call, and more than six officials had later spoken to the whistleblower about its contents.\n\nThe release of the complaint comes the day after the White House made public a summary reconstructed from notes that describes the phone call\u2019s contents. According to the White House summary, Zelensky expressed interest in purchasing more U.S.-made missiles before Trump asked the Ukrainian president for a \u201cfavor\u201d by looking into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden\u2019s activities in Ukraine.\n\nZelensky denied that Trump had pressured him on the call while sitting with the President at the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday. \u201cNobody pushed me,\u201d Zelensky said. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and said there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d on the call.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, White House Communications Director Stephanie Grisham said the complaint \u201cchanges nothing.\u201d \u201cThe President took the extraordinary and transparent steps of releasing the full, unredacted, and declassified transcript of his call with President Zelenskyy, which forms the heart of the complaint, as well as the complaint itself,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThat is because he has nothing to hide.\u201d\n\nThe July phone call and the allegations in the whistleblower complaint have become the focus on a formal impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives that Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday.\n\nHere are some of the significant allegations in the complaint.\n\nTranscript of Ukraine calls was moved to secret computer system\n\nThe whistleblower complaint says that a record of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president was placed into the system managed by the National Security Council Directorate for Intelligence Progress, which is typically reserved for top-secret information. White House officials told the whistleblower that their superiors in the Trump Administration had told them to remove the electronic transcript from the place such records are usually stored, where it would have been distributed to cabinet officials.\n\nAfter the memorandum was released, multiple Republicans in Congress who had read it were quick to stress that the President did nothing wrong. \u201cIt was very a gracious call. It was a very appropriate call,\u201d said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who was among the group of lawmakers invited to the White House Wednesday morning to read the memorandum before it was released to the public.\n\nBut the whistleblower complaint alleges that the White House took measures to classify the call, even though it did not contain any top-secret national security content.\n\n\u201cAccording to information I received from White House officials, some officials voiced concerns internally that this would be an abuse of the system and was not consistent with the responsibilities of the Directorate for Intelligence Programs,\u201d the whistleblower wrote. The whistleblower also noted that, based on conversations with White House officials, this was not the first time this had happened.\n\nIt seems inevitable that House Democrats will hone in on this development as they continue their impeachment inquiry.\n\nConcern from White House officials\n\nThe complaint indicates that the whistleblower, who was not a direct witness to the call, was provided with the information about it because of concern from White House officials that Trump was using his office to advance himself politically.", "description": "Here are the key passages in the whistleblower complaint detailing concerns over Donald Trump's call with the Ukrainian president.", "authors": ["Tara Law"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HbNpDW8R8Xtq28YJtWTO0Q--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/dc4553b62883a3a593390a400f39d068"}
