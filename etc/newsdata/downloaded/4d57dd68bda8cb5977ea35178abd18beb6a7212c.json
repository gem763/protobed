Ahold Delhaize has commenced the search for a successor, the Zaandam, Netherlands-based company said.\n\nThe change in the finance seat comes as the grocer seeks to increase sales while expanding e-commerce channels. Frans Muller, who last year became Ahold Delhaize\u2019s chief executive, has laid out a strategy focusing on top-line growth through online retail, a revamp of the company\u2019s Stop & Shop stores in the U.S. and acquisitions.\n\n\u201cThere is plenty to be done on all three [fronts], especially in the U.S.,\u201d said Bruno Monteyne, head of investment bank Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.\u2019s European food retail unit. Ahold Delhaize generated around 60% of its second-quarter net sales of \u20ac16.31 billion ($18.04 billion) in the U.S.\n\nOnline sales accounted only for 2.3%, or \u20ac221 million, of sales in the U.S., highlighting the challenges ahead for the management team, said Robert Jan Vos, an analyst at ABN Amro NV.\n\n\u201cThis is something they need to focus on because the market is transforming,\u201d Mr. Vos said. \u201cAnd they need to be part of the transformation.\u201d\n\nOnline giant Amazon.com Inc. \u2019s 2017 purchase of Whole Foods has put pressure on other grocers to expand their digital presence.\n\nAhold Delhaize said it is searching for a candidate with strong international experience who can help the company pursue comparable sales growth and market-share gains while driving down costs. The company plans to save a cumulative \u20ac1.8 billion by 2021.\n\n\u201cThe CFO at Ahold typically gets quite involved in overseeing the annual cost savings program,\u201d Mr. Monteyne said. \u201cThat is critical to stay competitive in any mature food retail market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe planned \u20ac1.8 billion in saved costs should provide the company with enough cash to support its brands and develop its online channels, which will help it withstand competition, said Sophie Coutaux, a senior director at ratings firm Fitch Ratings Inc.\n\nShareholders might ask a new CFO about potential acquisition plans, analysts said.\n\nAhold Delhaize does not have a reputation for being a very acquisitive company, but currently returns around \u20ac1 billion a year to shareholders, Mr. Vos said. \u201cYou could also spend this billion on acquiring companies,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Carr said last year that the company was \u201cconsidering opportunities that are related to technology and e-commerce.\u201d He added, \u201cWe will keep our eyes open for acquisitions and partnerships.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., the company\u2019s Stop & Shop business is still recovering from a strike in the second quarter. The strike\u2014which revolved around employee pay and benefits\u2014cost the company $224 million in lost sales and around $100 million in underlying operating income, Ahold Delhaize said in its latest earnings release.\n\n\u201cA new CFO will have to make some tough decisions on how to deal with the unions in the U.S.,\u201d said Cl\u00e9ment Genelot, a research analyst at Bryan, Garnier & Co.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "Dutch grocer Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize NV is looking for a new finance chief to boost sales and cut costs across 10 countries, including the U.S., its biggest market.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105388/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
