And probably for the same reason most other people go to bars: I like bartenders.\u201d\n\nName the first good drink you ever drank and where you had it. \u201cI was introduced to the classic Irish Coffee at an Irish pub called The James in Boulder back in 1989. They sold them for $1 whenever it was snowing. It was probably my first \u2018cocktail.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat book on cocktails or spirits is your go-to resource? \u201cMeehan\u2019s Bartender Manual by Jim Meehan. I find new things in that book\u2014sometimes between the lines\u2014every time I go back to it.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite cocktail and food pairing? \u201cA tart, cold Margarita with a bowl of guacamole and chips is pretty great, but perfection is a super briny, coastal single malt Scotch, like Talisker, with an icy plate of fresh-shucked oysters.\u201d\n\nWhat drink are you most proud of creating? \u201cThe Femme Fatale at El Five. It\u2019s a beautiful drink with a simple, classic sort of build and lots of complexity below the surface. Gin, lavender-infused St-Germain Elderflower Liqueur, briny manzanilla sherry, citric acid, and oil expressed from a grapefruit peel.\u201d\n\nIs there one person (dead or alive) you\u2019d like to make a cocktail for? \u201cAnthony Bourdain. He represented so much of what I love about people that work in restaurants, and in his sudden death he represented so many of the pitfalls in our industry as well, which is probably even more important to recognize.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite shot-and-a-beer combination? \u201cMezcal and a fruity sour, like a Berliner Weisse or a lime Gose.\u201d\n\nWhat is the one tool that you always make sure to pack when you\u2019re traveling for business? \u201cI have a small branding iron with a lightning bolt on it\u2014about an inch long. I\u2019ll heat it up and brand citrus peels with it for a drink garnish. It\u2019s a personal touch and a unique moment of \u2018bar theater\u2019 for the guest.\u201d\n\nKy Belk is the bar director of El Five in Denver, Colorado.\n\nInterview has been condensed and edited.", "description": "The bar director of El Five in Denver, Colorado, tackles our speed round of questions.", "authors": ["Noah Rothbaum", "Half Full Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571105227/191014-Rothbaum-Ky-Belk-tease_is5lqa", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
