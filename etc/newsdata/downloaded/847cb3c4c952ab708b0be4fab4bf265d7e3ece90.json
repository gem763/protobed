On Monday, Syrian government troops moved north toward the border region, setting up a potential clash with Turkish-led forces.\n\nKurdish forces previously allied with the U.S. said they had reached a deal with President Bashar Assad\u2019s government to help them fend off Turkey\u2019s invasion.\n\nIn Washington, Trump said in a statement that he was halting trade negotiations with Turkey and raising steel tariffs. He said he would soon sign an order permitting sanctions to be imposed on current and former Turkish officials.\n\nAmerican troops consolidated their positions in northern Syria on Monday and prepared to evacuate equipment in advance of a full withdrawal , a U.S. defense official said.\n\nThe hurried preparations, triggered by Trump\u2019s decision Saturday to expand a limited troop pullout into a complete withdrawal, came as Trump\u2019s national security team considered imposing what he called \u201cbig sanctions\u201d on NATO ally Turkey.\n\nThe U.S. pullout raised many questions, including how and whether the Trump administration would continue putting military pressure on the Islamic State in Syria without a troop presence on the ground. U.S. forces have been there since 2015, arming and advising a Kurdish-led Syrian group of fighters who largely eliminated IS control of Syrian territory but were still working to prevent an IS resurgence.\n\nThe defense official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name, said U.S. officials were weighing options for the future of a counter-IS campaign, including the possibility of waging it with a combination of air power and special operations forces based outside of Syria, perhaps in Iraq.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said Sunday that Trump had directed U.S. troops in northern Syria to begin pulling out \u201cas safely and quickly as possible.\u201d He did not say Trump ordered troops to leave Syria, but that seemed like the next step in a combat zone growing more unstable by the hour. The only exception, it appeared, is a group of perhaps 200 U.S. troops who will remain at a base in southern Syria near the Jordanian border, working with opposition forces unrelated to the Kurdish-led fighters in northern Syria.\n\nEsper said the U.S. withdrawal would be done carefully to protect the troops and to ensure that no U.S. equipment was left behind. He declined to say how long that might take.\n\nIn a series of tweets Monday, Trump defended his gamble that pulling U.S. forces out of Syria would not weaken U.S. security and credibility. He wrote that the IS prisoners who escaped amid the pandemonium in Syria can be \u201ceasily recaptured\u201d by Turkey or European nations, even as France said it was pulling its remaining troops out of Syria.\n\nTrump took sarcastic swipes at critics who say his Syria withdrawal amounts to a betrayal of the Kurds and plays into the hands of Russia.\n\n\u201cAnyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d\n\nTrump has dug in on his decision to pull out the troops, believing it fulfills a key campaign promise and will be a winning issue in the 2020 election, according to White House officials.\n\nIt\u2019s not a new issue for the president. He rallied around it in 2016 and, during his term, has repeatedly urged bringing the troops home only to be talked out of it by moderating forces including former Defense Secretary James Mattis and chief of staff John Kelly. Mattis resigned last December when Trump announced \u2014 and later partly rescinded \u2014 a decision to pull all troops out of Syria.\n\nIn his remarks Sunday, Esper said the administration had little choice but to order a pullout.\n\n\u201cWe have American forces likely caught between two opposing advancing armies and it\u2019s a very untenable situation,\u201d Esper said.\n\nThis seemed likely to herald the end of a five-year effort to partner with Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters to ensure a lasting defeat of the Islamic State group. Hundreds of IS supporters escaped a holding camp amid clashes between invading Turkish-led forces and Kurdish fighters, and analysts said an IS resurgence seemed more likely, just months after Trump declared the extremists defeated.\n\nRepublican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, normally a staunch Trump supporter, said he was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d by events in Syria and Trump\u2019s response so far.\n\nWithdrawing U.S. forces from Syria \u201cwould re-create the very conditions that we have worked hard to destroy and invite the resurgence of ISIS,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAnd such a withdrawal would also create a broader power vacuum in Syria that will be exploited by Iran and Russia, a catastrophic outcome for the United States\u2019 strategic interests.\u201d\n\nHowever, Trump got quick support from Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who had lambasted his withdrawal decision last week as \u201cshortsighted,\u201d \u201dirresponsible\u201d and \u201cunnerving to its core.\u201d On Monday, echoing Trump, Graham said on Fox News Channel that the current situation was Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s fault and Turkey would face \u201ccrippling sanctions\u201d from the U.S. on its economy.\n\nThe U.S. has had about 1,000 troops in northeastern Syria allied with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces to combat IS. The Pentagon previously had pulled about 30 of these troops from the Turkish attack zone along the border. With an escalation of violence, a widening of the Turkish incursion and the prospect of a deepening conflict, all U.S. forces along the border will now follow that move. It was unclear where they would go.\n\nThe Kurds have turned to the Syrian government and Russia for military assistance, further complicating the battlefield.\n\nThe prospect of enhancing the Syrian government\u2019s position on the battlefield and inviting Russia to get more directly involved is seen by Trump\u2019s critics as a major mistake. But he tweeted that it shouldn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cOthers may want to come in and fight for one side or the other,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLet them!\u201d\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Trump is weakening America. \u2018To be clear, this administration\u2019s chaotic and haphazard approach to policy by tweet is endangering the lives of U.S. troops and civilians,\u201d Menendez said in a statement. \u201cThe only beneficiaries of this action are ISIS, Iran and Russia.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nAP writer Jonathan Lemire contributed to this story.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Targeting Turkey's economy, President Donald Trump announced sanctions Monday aimed at restraining the Turks' assault against Kurdish", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/14/51e91f_aptopix-turkey-us-syria-64432-in-photo-turkish-border-turkey-syria-in-akcakale-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
