It's one of India\u2019s most widely-celebrated holidays and represents light overcoming darkness.\n\nThursday's White House ceremony, which was closed to reporters and cameras, took place three days ahead of the formal celebration, which begins on Oct. 27 in India and lasts four to five days.\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images\n\nLast year, Trump held an open Diwali ceremony, but was criticized for tweeting about the holiday and failing to include Hindus, one of the largest groups that participates in the celebration.\n\nToday, we gathered for Diwali, a holiday observed by Buddhists, Sikhs, and Jains throughout the United States & around the world. Hundreds of millions of people have gathered with family & friends to light the Diya and to mark the beginning of a New Year. https://t.co/epHogpTY1A pic.twitter.com/9LUwnhngWJ \u2014 Donald J.
