The was, alongside the , the main beneficiary.\n\nQuick Take\n\nYou wouldn't have guessed it was a true 'risk-off' environment out there as the EU-US trade war escalates by analyzing the performance of the NZD and the CHF. The former ended up as the main winner, only surpassed by the perky Yen, while the latter succumbed to a depressed inflation print out of Switzerland, which increases the risk of further negative rates by the SNB. Again, risk sentiment matters as much as fundamentally-derived flows. But the NZD performance is one I still scratch my head. The utter evaporation of longs in the off fresh yearly highs is also quite an X-file to ruminate about, without much of a particular catalyst other than the fall in Oil prices, which in my opinion, does not justify the annihilation of CAD longs. The USD saw solid demand right off the gates in Europe, but gave it all back as capital flows entered in the US. Meanwhile, both the Euro and the Sterling were well underpinned by demand flows, the latter driven by the subtle positivism so far around UK PM's plan to solve the Irish backstop. Last but not least, the most volatile currency on Tuesday, the Australian Dollar, saw slow fluctuations as the short-side interest dries out after its overextended move.\n\nThe indices show the performance of a particular currency vs G8 FX. An educational video on how to interpret these indices can be found in the Global Prime's Research section.\n\nNarratives In Financial Markets\n\n* The Information is gathered after scanning top publications including the FT, WSJ, Reuters, Bloomberg, ForexLive, Institutional Bank Research reports.\n\nEquities suffer the consequences of EU-US trade war escalation: It\u2019s been a rough start of a new quarter for the likes of equities, both in Europe and the US, as concerns over global growth after the decade-low print in the US ISM must now be co-exist with heightened tensions of a trade war with the US at the center, this time against Europe after a WTA ruling, partly expected, allowing the US to impose tariffs on EU products.\n\nWTO ruling in favor of the US deepens risk aversion: The WTO ruled that the US can go ahead imposing tariffs worth over $7bn in EU products, including wine, whisky, luxury goods and aircraft in retaliation for the loss of business by Boeing due to illegal EU aid to Airbus. The US is set to impose retaliatory tariffs of 10% on EU aircraft, and 25% on EU agricultural, industrial goods. The measures are set to take effect on Oct 18. Authorities in Europe have been quick to react, noting that this strategy is likely to be responded with counter tariff measures by the EU.\n\nThe US ISM PMI set the ball rolling: The US is seen as one of the ultimate safe harbor out there, still immune to the debilitating macroeconomics elsewhere, but the recessionary reality in the manufacturing sector coupled with aiming to fight a fresh trade war with Europe while fully immersed in trade dispute with China is a major red flag.\n\nWatch today's US ISM non-manuf PMI: The US ISM-non manuf PMI is set to be a big market mover as a more important proxy of the state of the overall economy in the US, given that the services industry represents a larger share of the economy. If the last print in August serves as an indication, the sector continues to thrive for now.\n\nUS ADP (NASDAQ: ) data not a good omen for the US economy: A soft print in the US private sector payrolls, coming at +135K in September vs 140k expected, alongside a downward revision to 157k from 195k threw more cold water. The market now awaits the US NFP report on Friday in order to gather new evidence on the state of employment in America, one of the bedrocks of the economy so far.\n\nJPY the unquestionable winner as stocks/yields drop: The depth of the fall in bond yields and stocks is what led to the acceleration by the Japanese Yen index, which has capitalized on the positive technicals after the breakout of a long-held range on the back of the US ISM miss.\n\nLow Swiss inflation raises alarm bells for further negative rates: The Swissy, even if seen as a funding currency set to perform well amid risk aversion, has been lagging way behind, as the Swiss inflation in September missed median estimates by coming at the lowest in almost 3 years. Depressed inflation and the macro strength in the Swiss national currency increase the risk of further negative rates by the SNB.\n\nFed's Williams in neutral camp: Fed's member Williams crossed the wires, saying that monetary policy is in 'the right place', which implies he is in neutral territory, even if the market now sees the chances of the Fed funds cut in October at 74% chance vs 60% last Friday.\n\nGBP receives tentative positive news: The GBP has continued to trade in an erratic and non-directional fashion despite the fact that UK PM Boris Johnson revealed his plans for the Irish backstop. In a nutshell, Johnson proposes that Northern Ireland remains compliant with EU rules with some checkpoints away from the border still in place as a special temporary arrangement for four years before the Northern Irish parliament determines if the arrangements are to be extended.\n\nUK PM Brexit plan 'up in the air': The plan was welcomed by the DUP and Brexiteers but Irish PM Varadkar said the backstop proposal didn\u2019t fully \u201cmeet the agreed objectives\u201d. Meanwhile, EC President Juncker sounded neutral, noting pros in his comments such as that the proposal contained \u201cpositive advances\u201d but at the same time, noting it had \u201csome problematic points\u201d. The EU Summit on October 17th looms near and that\u2019s when the GBP will be most volatile.\n\nStay glued to the Brexit newsflows to get a bias on the Pound: However, according to Verhofstadt, a Belgian politician, the reaction of most MEPs to UK proposal was \"not positive\" ahead head of the Brexit steering group in European parliament, even if the reporter added that they will discuss it more in the days ahead.\n\nRecent Economic Indicators & Events Ahead\n\nSource: Forexfactory\n\nA Dive Into The FX Indices Charts\n\nThe indices show the performance of a particular currency vs G8 FX. An educational video on how to interpret these indices can be found in the Global Prime's Research section.\n\nThe EUR index successful rotation off the lows was always going to make it riskier to endorse shorts with a high degree of conviction as dip buying activity could very well be expected, and eventually, that\u2019s what has transpired. We haven\u2019t had to wait long for the market to make up its mind that the path of least resistance into the US NFP (36h away) is to the upside. The acceptance of higher levels into the NY close, alongside the 2nd leg up, supports the notion that the cycle is now in that prime state where a 3rd leg up should ensue. On the way down, it will require a drop of 0.2% or 0.4% roughly to expect the highest concentration of bid clusters.\n\nThe GBP index continues to find relentless demand interest off the daily support area drawn in red. If you were to engage in long-side GBP exposure every time the index nears the area, your plays would have had a high chance of being successful every single time. That\u2019s how power power lies in assessing the potential demand imbalances on an aggregate basis vs G8 FX. To the downside, any revisit of the daily support will likely continue to be bought, while engaging is GBP shorts carries a higher risk due to twofold. Firstly, because the last swing low failed to rotate back to the previous low, and secondly, because a daily support area is now in control.\n\nThe USD index attracted strong demand off the daily support line drawn 24h ago, which means those entering long USD vs the weakest projected currencies such as the CHF, would have had a field day indeed. The failure to retest the prior swing high does not invalidate trading off the daily support, but you want to be patient until at least there is a break as the market will then be given a chance to enter long with deeper liquidity available. Should the support be broken, the next one is found over 0.3% lower, hence it could also be a bearish day for the USD if initial acceptance is found below the daily support right underneath.\n\nThe CAD index has come under exceptional sell-side pressure with the decline in Oil alone not really justifying the overextended depreciation in the currency. Demand in the CAD is expected to emerge within close proximity of the current price, anywhere between the current level and 0.2% lower, where a major daily support in the context of a successful rotation will be found. To the upside, we should wait patiently until the creation of a new resistance area, not yet visible, due to the impulsive and rapid depreciation of the currency index.\n\nThe NZD index should see renewed sell-side pressure at a level of resistance identified in the 8h chart, which makes Wednesday\u2019s correction a potential selling opportunity into Thursday, especially considering the successful rotation achieves off the last swing high currently tested. The proximity of the baseline right overhead adds to the bearish case. Matching up short NZD against a currency expected to find demand nearby is the way to go. The downside potential also looks quite attractive, with over 0.6% until a retest of the trend lows.\n\nThe AUD index is closing in into a sell-side resistance area off the hourly chart, followed by a daily resistance not far above (0.15%). The dovish outlook by the RBA makes the Australian Dollar a clear candidate to experience further sell-side pressure, as it is the deterioration in risk sentiment ever since the US ISM PMI, now exacerbated by the EU-US trade war escalation. Allowing the AUD to keep correcting higher only to be prepared to engage in shorts against currencies with expected demand to be found is the way to go, similar to the picture in the NZD.\n\nThe JPY index has shot up past the 100% proj target, which means the probability of a rotation back down towards areas of demand is rather high. It certainly is for the brave with momentum-type strategies to be deployed jumping on such an elongated movements. It\u2019s worth noting that the initiation of the aggressive buy-side campaign on Wed came off an outlined support line on the 8h chart. If you are a value-seeking trader, allowing the JPY to deflate from its lofty levels it trades at before giving considerations to engage in long plays is a sensible approach. The 100% proj is an excellent tool to anticipate when a swing is overcooked and has the highest chances of temporarily terminating, and that\u2019s what where the JPY trades at.\n\nThe CHF index trades in between demand and supply areas after being hammered on the back of a miss in the Swiss CPI. The successful leg down allows us now to draw key levels of resistance on the way up, which will require first for the Swissy to correct significantly higher. On the downside, there is a daily support area over 0.5% under today\u2019s close. It essentially makes the Swissy a non-tradable currency in the near-by vicinity amid the lack of levels definition.\n\nImportant Footnotes", "description": "Forex Analysis by Ivan Delgado covering: USD/JPY, USD/CAD, NZD/USD, Automatic Data Processing Inc.
