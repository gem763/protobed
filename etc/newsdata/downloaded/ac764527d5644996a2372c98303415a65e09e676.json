REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo\n\nZimbabweans have been confused about when they would get to pay their last respects to Mugabe since his death in a Singapore hospital on Friday after a long illness.\n\nMugabe had dominated Zimbabwean politics for almost four decades from independence in 1980 until he was removed by his own army in a November 2017 coup.\n\nRevered by many as a liberator who freed his people from white minority rule, Mugabe was vilified by others for wrecking one of Africa\u2019s most promising economies and ruthlessly crushing his opponents.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa, who worked closely with Mugabe for decades before helping to oust him, granted Mugabe the status of national hero within hours of his death.\n\nThe memo sent by Zimbabwe\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs to embassies in Harare and seen by Reuters said the funeral would be in the National Sports Stadium but did not specify where the burial would be.\n\nIt said heads of state would be expected to leave the stadium immediately after the funeral ceremony because officials would be busy with preparations for the burial.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Independent newspaper reported last month that Mugabe didn\u2019t want to be buried at National Heroes Acre - a site reserved for the country\u2019s heroes - because he felt bitter about the way he was removed from power.\n\nIn comments to The Sunday Mail newspaper Mnangagwa\u2019s spokesman George Charamba denied that the government and Mugabe\u2019s family were at loggerheads over where the former president should be buried and said the provisional plan was for the burial to be at National Heroes Acre.\n\nThe Sunday Mail said Mugabe\u2019s body was expected back from Singapore on Wednesday afternoon and that Mnangagwa, members of Mugabe\u2019s family and traditional chiefs from Mugabe\u2019s Zvimba district would receive the body at Harare\u2019s Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport.\n\nLeo Mugabe, the former president\u2019s nephew, told Reuters earlier on Sunday that Mugabe\u2019s family and traditional chiefs had finalised their preferred programme for his burial but it had yet to be approved by the government. He was not available for comment after Reuters saw the government memo.\n\nCHURCH PRAYERS\n\nAt the packed Sacred Heart Cathedral in Harare, where Mugabe used to attend Catholic Mass with his first wife Sally and second wife Grace, people prayed on Sunday morning for their departed former leader.\n\n\u201cWe are praying for our relatives who have died. Without forgetting to pray for our former president, Comrade Robert Mugabe, we bring him forward to God. We are asking God if there is anything that he did wrong in his life that he be forgiven,\u201d the priest told the congregation, speaking in the local Shona language.\n\nChris Sambo, a former soccer administrator who used to arrange matches for Mugabe in his home village of Kutama, said the southern African country\u2019s Catholic community had lost one of its most important members.\n\nTsitsi Samukange, another churchgoer, said Mugabe was a devout man who fought for his country.\n\n\u201cI think everyone can admit that without the work he did we would not be as independent as we are,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou know when you fight, in a fight sometimes you lose your teeth, (right)? And we became poorer. But that\u2019s a fight and he did it, and we should give him that.\u201d\n\nMany Harare residents said at the weekend that they were saddened by Mugabe\u2019s death and that it marked the end of an era.\n\nBut his ousting in 2017 was accompanied by celebrations across the country of 13 million and critics at home and abroad viewed him as a power-obsessed autocrat who unleashed death squads, rigged elections and ruined the economy to keep control.", "description": "The Zimbabwean government plans a state funeral for longtime ruler Robert Mugabe in a sports stadium in Harare next Saturday, with a burial ceremony a day later, it said in memo sent to embassies on Sunday.", "authors": ["Macdonald Dzirutwe", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427665189&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870V8-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
