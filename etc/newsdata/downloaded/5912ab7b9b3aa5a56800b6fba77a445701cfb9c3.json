I do go out running at least every other day, but walking is a different type of fitness. It has taken a few days to get used to walking hour after hour. My legs have felt a bit like lead.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve got to interact with lots of people, amused some and perhaps frightened others \u2013 not deliberately! If people don\u2019t notice me coming and suddenly see me it can spook them.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charity effort is to raise money for the Gorilla Organisation who work in Uganda, Rwanda and the Congo to protect mountain gorillas.\n\nTom Harrison is walking for seven days (Picture: Jerry Syder/Metro.co.uk)\n\nClimbing a tree in Whitehall Gardens (Picture: Jerry Syder/Metro.co.uk)\n\n(Picture: Jerry Syder/Metro.co.uk)\n\nTom said: \u2018There has been a big ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo that hasn\u2019t really been controlled. If gorillas get ebola it\u2019s always fatal. Rangers have been trying to keep people out of the forest to protect them.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s why I chose my red outfit \u2013 it\u2019s kind of an ebola alert.\u2019\n\nHe has taken a week of annual leave to be here, taking time away from his job working as a police officer in Camden.\n\n\u2018This is in some ways a break from the day job, a bit of fun. It\u2019s keeping me healthy,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018I have a phone and a bit of money in my back pocket. But I don\u2019t have a bag \u2013 a bit like a gorilla, it\u2019s living hand to mouth really.\u2019\n\nA morning message on Day 5 of my #GreatGorillaWalk for @Gorillas_Org pic.twitter.com/3z9XVAVcCs \u2014 Mr Gorilla (@GorillaSaver) October 23, 2019\n\nSo far, he has already met and posed for photos London Mayor Sadiq Khan as well as his local MP Dame Cheryl Gillan.\n\nThe walk will continue until Friday, when he will be joined for the last mile by his two sons aged eight and six \u2013 also dressed in gorilla costumes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJillian Miller, executive director of the Gorilla Organisation, said there has recently been good news for mountain gorillas, which have been reclassified as endangered instead of critically endangered this year. There are now 1,004 left in the wild.\n\nShe thanked Tom for his efforts, saying: \u2018Tom is by far and away the most outstanding community fundraiser we\u2019ve ever had. He\u2019s unstoppable. He comes to me with these mad ideas and I say, \u201cOh Tom, you can\u2019t do that, walking around Westminster in a gorilla costume \u2013 you\u2019ll get arrested!\u201d\u2019\n\nHe reassured her it is a lawful act and Brits are known for their eccentricities.\n\nVisit his JustGiving page here.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
