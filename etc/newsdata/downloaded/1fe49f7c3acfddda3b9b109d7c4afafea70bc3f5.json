That complaint has grown into a scandal: At its heart is a question of whether Trump used the power of his office to attempt to influence a foreign country to meddle in the 2020 election.\n\nBut while the president has admitted to discussing Biden with Ukraine, he insists \u2014 despite no apparent evidence to support this \u2014 that there is another, more important scandal to focus on: the former vice president used his office to help the business interests of his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThe gist of Trump\u2019s theory: Biden played a role in the removal of Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor in 2016; Trump, repeating a conspiracy theory popularized by his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, maintains the former vice president did so to protect his son. Biden and the Ukrainian prosecutor, Trump claims, is the \u201creal story\u201d \u2014 not a whistleblower\u2019s complaint that Trump improperly used his influence over foreign policy to damage a political rival.\n\nThe evidence suggests Biden actually may have placed his son in legal danger by advocating for the prosecutor\u2019s removal because he was widely accused of stymying anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine \u2014 replacing him could have led to further investigations into a company Hunter Biden had ties to.\n\nTrump evidently sees the conspiracy theory as a way to turn the whistleblower\u2019s complaint into electoral gain \u2014 perhaps in hopes of saddling the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination with a Benghazi-like scandal that just won\u2019t go away. He has repeatedly misrepresented facts, characterizing the prosecutor who was removed as \u201ctough,\u201d and saying he wants to stop \u201cpeople like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is facing increasing scrutiny from national media, and Democrats say his actions are grounds for impeachment.\n\nHunter Biden joined the board of a Ukrainian company while it was under investigation\n\nThe facts of this story begin in April 2014, when Hunter Biden joined the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company named Burisma Holdings, shortly after his business partner in an investment and consulting firm, Devon Archer, came aboard. Although Biden had no apparent expertise in the field, he had helped Burisma previously as a consultant with expertise in dealing with multinational regulations, and he was employed at a law firm retained by Burisma\u2019s owner, former Ukrainian government official Mykola Zlochevsky.\n\nWhen Biden joined Burisma\u2019s board, both the company and Zlochevsky were already the subject of intense controversy. Zlochevsky had served as a top official for Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, who was forced out of office in early 2014, in part due to concerns over rampant corruption. Zlochevsky was accused of corruption as well, including for steering large government contracts to companies he owned.\n\nOne party investigating these allegations was the United Kingdom, because Zlochevsky had $23 million in a British bank account that UK officials believed has been laundered. Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office froze that account, and shortly after Yanukovych left office in February 2014, sent a request to Ukrainian officials for documents it believed would help in prove its case. Following this request, the new Ukrainian government began its own investigation into Zlochevsky, looking into whether he embezzled public money.\n\nIn the midst of these troubles, Hunter Biden accepted a Burisma board seat, and was paid for his trouble, sometimes as much as $50,000 per month. It is unclear what he did for the company. Burisma said at the time that Biden \u2014 a lawyer \u2014 would be \u201cin charge of\u201d a legal unit. Biden told the New York Times in May 2019 that this was incorrect: \u201cAt no time was I in charge of the company\u2019s legal affairs.\u201d\n\nThough none of this looks great for the Bidens, it is, unfortunately, routine business in Washington to hire the family members of powerful officials in hopes of gaining influence over public policy. For example, President Jimmy Carter\u2019s brother, Billy; President George W. Bush\u2019s brother, Neil; and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s brothers, Tony and Hugh Rodham were all involved in business interests that once drew concern.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK and Ukraine continued to investigate Zlochevsky and other Yanukovych officials, often with the support of the US. But eventually, British investigators began to grow frustrated with what they characterized as a lack of cooperation from their Ukrainian counterparts, saying needed documents weren\u2019t being provided.\n\nThe US became increasingly involved in the issue, and by December 2014, had sent a letter warning the new government would be forced to face unpleasant consequences if it didn\u2019t do more to aid the UK. That threat went unheeded, and by 2015, British officials were forced to release the frozen funds, which Zlochevsky immediately moved to Cyprus, according to Bloomberg.\n\nJoe Biden played a role in pushing out Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general\n\nThe part of the story that involves Joe Biden directly centers on the ouster of Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin.\n\nIn February 2015, Shokin became Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, and promised critics of his country\u2019s anti-corruption efforts at home, in the US, and at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that a clean-up was on the way. And he claimed Burisma was in his sights.\n\nBut Shokin\u2019s deputy, Vitaly Kasko, told Bloomberg that the promise was empty rhetoric. According to Kasko, their office did nothing to pursue its investigation into Zlochevsky throughout 2015, and the office was ineffective at reining in corruption generally, leading him to resign in frustration.\n\nShokin has disputed Kasko\u2019s narrative, but the manner in which he was running his office also concerned the US ambassador to Ukraine, who said publicly in September 2015 that the office was \u201csubverting\u201d the UK\u2019s investigation.\n\nConcern at the embassy mounted, and by 2016, officials there began suggesting the Obama administration push for the prosecutor general\u2019s ouster. In particular, the embassy suggested that $1 billion in loan guarantees the country hoped to receive from the US in order to stay solvent should be tied to a tougher anti-corruption strategy that involved removing officials seen as blocking progress, namely Shokin.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the US that wanted Shokin gone, either \u2014 many other Western European officials, including the IMF\u2019s then-managing director Christine Lagarde, also insisted Ukraine was doing far too little about corruption.\n\nSo in March 2016, Biden says he told the Ukrainian government that their loan guarantees would be cut off unless they removed Shokin. He told the story at a session at the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re not getting the billion.\u2019 I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours,\u201d Biden told his audience. \u201cI looked at them and said: \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe former vice president said after the threat, \u201cWell, son of a bitch, he got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\u201d\n\nBut though Biden may have taken credit for it, this was hardly his unique idea. \u201cEveryone in the Western community wanted Shokin sacked,\u201d Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe whole G-7, the IMF, the EBRD, everybody was united that Shokin must go, and the spokesman for this was Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nThe people of Ukraine wanted Shokin gone as well, and demonstrated for his removal around the time of Biden\u2019s threat. Shortly after that demonstration, Shokin was dismissed.\n\nTrump hopes to distract from the whistleblower by pushing a conspiracy theory\n\nTrump and his allies have asserted \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 that Biden\u2019s ouster of Shokin was itself corrupt, and specifically that it was aimed at protecting Hunter and Burisma from a corruption investigation led by Shokin.\n\nTrump has tweeted the Bidens are \u201cstone cold Crooked.\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has called concerns over the whistleblower\u2019s complaint as a Democratic scheme fool the public into ignoring \u201cwhat Biden was doing.\u201d And Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has said he wants the Justice Department to \u201clook at the Biden-Ukraine connection, like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection.\u201d\n\nBiden spokesperson Kate Bedingfield said all this is nonsense, and that Biden pushed to oust Shokin \u201cwithout any regard for how it would or would not impact any business interests of his son, a private citizen.\u201d\n\nBiden himself blasted Trump\u2019s efforts to discredit him at the Iowa Democrats\u2019 Steak Fry over the weekend, calling the president\u2019s actions on the phone call \u201can overwhelming abuse of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s doing this because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me.\u201d\n\nAnd despite his boast last year, Biden seem to have played a very minor role in Shokin\u2019s firing. With the Obama administration, the idea to remove him came from the US\u2019s embassy in Ukraine, and the sentiment the prosecutor was hindering anti-corruption efforts was shared by the US\u2019s partners and Ukrainian citizens. Too, removing Shokin has the potential to hurt Hunter Biden given the US had him replaced in order to ensure someone more fully committed to pursuing an anti-corruption agenda \u2014 including an investigation into the former Ukraine official Mykola Zlochevsky \u2014 was installed.\n\nRudy Giuliani has long claimed that these points aside, Biden did indeed do something wrong. Giuliani told the New Yorker that he has talked with Shokin, and that Shokin insists he was seriously investigating Burisma before he was fired. Shokin made the same claim to Ukrainian news agency Strana shortly after his firing.\n\nThe question of whether Shokin\u2019s investigation against Burisma was in fact a serious one is disputed, however. His deputy has said it was not, as have US officials based in Ukraine; and according the New York Times, some US and Ukrainian officials believe the former prosecutor was pantomiming an investigation in effort to solicit a bribe from Zlochevsky.\n\nIn any case, Ukraine has a new president now: Volodymyr Zelensky, who has also promised to stamp out corruption. And it was in a call with him that Trump reportedly urged him to investigate Joe Biden and Burisma, which he calls the \u201creal story.\u201d\n\nTrump has now taken that call public, and some Republican allies now hope to launch a domestic investigation. In doing so, he has created a counternarrative to combat questions of whether he committed an impeachment offense in his call with Zelensky, albeit one whose effectiveness \u2014 particularly given the facts of Biden\u2019s limited interaction with Ukraine \u2014 remains to be seen.", "description": "Trump claims Biden threatened Ukraine to aid his son\u2019s business interests.
