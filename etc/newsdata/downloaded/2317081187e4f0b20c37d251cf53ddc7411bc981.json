Anyone can win on any given day. Tony is a formidable fighter. Also, he's very, very, tough.\n\n(Image: Zuffa LLC)\n\n\"He does go down. He does get dropped. His guard has been passed. He's been mounted by a lesser fighter. So I would favour Khabib in that bout.\"\n\nMcGregor is due to hold a press conference in Moscow on Thursday, primarily to promote his Proper Twelve whiskey.\n\nHe is also expected to address his future in mixed martial arts.\n\nThe Irishman has been embroiled in controversy since his last appearance, knocking a phone out of a fan's hand in Miami and then allegedly punching a man in an Irish pub.\n\n(Image: Getty Images North America)\n\nMcGregor appeared in court last week and will do so again next Friday when he must enter a plea.\n\nMeanwhile, the 31-year-old claimed he signed off on the Baddest Motherf***** belt which will be on the line when Nate Diaz takes on Jorge Masvidal at UFC 244.\n\n\"I designed that 'Badmotherf*****' belt,\u201d he said. \"I actually designed that. I signed off on the design of how they are creating that belt.\n\n\"So most certainly that belt was brought into fruition, brought to life because of me: the real 'bad motherf*****'.\n\n\"So most certainly one of those men is on my radar.\"", "description": "Ferguson is next in line to take on UFC lightweight champion Nurmagomedov next year", "authors": ["Martin Domin", "Image", "Zuffa Llc", "Getty Images North America"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9960453.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/UFC-209-Ultimate-Media-Day.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
