Everyone should take shelter immediately as winds will increase rapidly and unpredictably after the eye passes.\u201d\n\nDorian hit land in Elbow Cay in the Abaco Islands after officials made last-minute pleas for those in low-lying areas to evacuate. Still, they recognized there were not many structures on higher ground on the largely flat archipelago southeast of Florida.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center in Miami said Dorian\u2019s maximum sustained winds at its 12:45 p.m. landfall were 185 mph, up from 175 mph. It was moving west at 7 mph. \u201cCatastrophic conditions\u201d were unfolding in the Abaco Islands and are expected across Grand Bahama later in the day, the center said.\n\nHURRICANE DORIAN'S PATH: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nDorian\u2019s power was second only to Hurricane Allen in 1980, with its 190-mph winds.\n\nSilbert Mills, owner of the Bahamas Christian Network, said trees and power lines were torn down in the Abaco Islands and some roads were impassable.\n\n\u201cThe winds are howling like we\u2019ve never, ever experienced before,\u201d said Mills, 59, who planned to ride out the hurricane with his family in the concrete home he built 41 years ago in central Abaco.\n\nBahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis warned that any \u201cwho do not evacuate are placing themselves in extreme danger and can expect a catastrophic consequence.\u201d\n\nCONTINUING COVERAGE OF HURRICANE DORIAN ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL\n\nStill, dozens of people ignored evacuation orders, officials said, and they were warned they were placing their lives in danger.\n\nJack Pittard, a 76-year-old American who has been traveling to the Bahamas for 40 years, said he decided to ride out the storm in the Abaco Islands. He said it\u2019s the first hurricane he\u2019s experiencing in his life.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s fear,\u201d he said by phone Sunday as it approached. \u201cI\u2019m worried about destruction of property, but I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s going to be loss of lives here.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPittard said he battened up his house and would spend the storm in a nearby duplex behind a group of cottages that a friend owned. He noted the ocean was quite deep near where he\u2019s staying, and a cay would provide protection, so he didn\u2019t expect significant storm surge.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "As Hurricane Dorian, the second-strongest Atlantic hurricane since 1950, struck the Bahamas on Sunday as a catastrophic Category 5 storm with 185 mph, authorities gave strong warnings to potential victims.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
