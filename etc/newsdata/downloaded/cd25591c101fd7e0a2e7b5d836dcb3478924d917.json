But this is not doing you any favors in finding a professional job.\"\n\nMs Clow said the application form requested an Instagram and/or Facebook handle.\n\nThe company then suggested she should follow its Instagram account, and it was at that point she made the discovery.\n\n\"I went through their company story [on Instagram] and saw they had posted my picture.\n\n\"I honestly was taken aback. I wasn't sure how to react and it took me a while to process what had happened.\"\n\nMs Clow told the BBC: \"I decided to reach out to the company first and told them how I had archived the photo and appreciated their advice.\n\n\"I sent a follow-up email shortly after with my resume, cover letter and saying how I hope to hear from them soon.\n\n\"I asked at the bottom of the email to please take down the story and thanked them for understanding.\"\n\nKickass Mastermind chief executive Sara Christensen said the photo was taken down as soon as Ms Clow requested it to do so.\n\nBut Ms Clow said she had to ask repeatedly for the post to be removed and was eventually blocked.\n\n\"That is when I took my situation to my personal story and Twitter.\"\n\n'Death threats'\n\nOpinion was divided after Ms Clow posted her tweet.\n\nOne user said there was nothing wrong with what Ms Clow was wearing as it was \"appropriate clothing\" for the environment she was in.\n\nBut another pointed out it was common practice for employers to view job applicants' social media profiles to determine suitability for roles.\n\nOne Twitter user thought there was fault on both sides.\n\nMs Christensen said Ms Clow \"was not disqualified because of her social media profile\".\n\n\"In fact, she was not disqualified at all,\" she told the BBC. \"There was no communication to her saying she was disqualified. I have an email communication from her still expressing interest in the position after the post.\"\n\nThe company's actions prompted a backlash on social media, with some people pointing to images from the company's own social accounts that showed photos of staff in swimsuits and clothing with a swear word on it.\n\nThe company's website and social accounts have now been deleted or set to private.\n\nMs Christensen explained: \"We have taken down our social accounts and website because of numerous death threats and thousands of harassing messages.\"\n\nMs Clow said she had since received offers of \"interviews and opportunities\" from elsewhere.", "description": "An Instagram story belittling a job applicant backfired on a marketing company.", "authors": ["Andree Massiah", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D804/production/_109100355_emilyclowinsta.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
