Numerous studies show that gardening is not only a tremendous source of happiness, but also a fountain of youth for your body and mind. It\u2019s one of several \u201cgreen activities\u201d I love to do in the spring, when our bodies are just itching to get outside after a long, cold winter. If you are new to gardening or just want some ideas about how you can spend more time outside, you\u2019ve come to the right place.\n\nHealth Benefits of Gardening\n\nTen-thousand years ago, gardening entirely changed the way humans live and eat. When our ancestors started to plant and cultivate fruits, vegetables and grains, humankind slowly graduated away from a nomadic society to a more sedentary one. Now with every food you could possibly grow sold at the grocery store \u2013 along with countless more already packaged and prepared \u2013 there is no need to have your own garden, right? Wrong. Gardening is so much more than fruits, vegetables, herbs, and flowers. In fact, I\u2019d argue that the fruit of your labor (pun intended) isn\u2019t actually the food, but rather a healthier mind and body. This is confirmed by countless studies, but I want to highlight a few in particular. One of the more impressive studies tracked 2,800 people over the age of 60 for a 16-year period. It found that physical activity \u2013 including gardening \u2013 couldby as much as 36%. Another study showed that. All that digging, weeding, trimming, pruning \u2013 those menial tasks are actually huge stress relievers. This study showed that people who worked outside in their garden for 30 minutes (compared to people who stayed inside and read a book) not only reported being in a better mood afterward, but their blood tests showed lower levels of cortisol, the stress hormone. Gardening is also a. Gardening involves a variety of moments \u2013 digging, pulling weeds, twisting and bending, and reaching for tools. It works muscles in your body and builds your strength, stamina and flexibility. This also reaffirms why gardening is such a great stress reliever. Exercise is one of the best ways to chase the blues, whether you are just having a bad day or if you have depression or anxiety. That last bit is crucial because it\u2019s common for people to experience bouts of depression, especially once they reach their retirement years. Suddenly, you have all this free time and you aren\u2019t interacting with as many people on a daily basis as you used to. Guess what? Gardening helps that too! I like to call gardens \u201cretirement projects\u201d to my patients who are Type-A go-getters and need something to sink their teeth into. Finally, when you are gardening, you are grounding yourself to the earth \u2013 just you, the sun, the air, and the soil. Not only is it relaxing, but it dispels an invisible, omnipresent and dangerous toxin: electro-magnetic frequencies (EMFs). EMFs are by-products of an assortment of appliances, devices, and various electronic household items.\n\nTips for First-Time Gardeners\n\nStart simple : Do some research about what plants grow in your area. Your local nursery would be a great source of information and a great place to get many of the supplies you need \u2013 seeds, tools, clothes, gloves and more. When deciding what you want to plant, remember that these small seeds will be plants that grow larger every day and need more care, especially in July when the summer heat is in full effect. Keep your first gardening season a simple one so you ensure that it\u2019s a successful one.\n\n: Do some research about what plants grow in your area.

Protect yourself from the sun : Sunlight is a tremendous source of vitamin D, but always be careful of overexposure to the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays\u201420 minutes of direct exposure is plenty. In addition to sunscreen, wear a hat that provides shade to your face and neck. Loose fitting clothes can block your skin from direct sunlight without restraining your movement or make you feel overheated.\n\n: Sunlight is a tremendous source of vitamin D, but always be careful of overexposure to the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays\u201420 minutes of direct exposure is plenty.

Pay attention to weather forecasts : Spring is the best time of year to start digging, but it\u2019s also the rainiest time of year. Stay attuned to your local forecast so you can plan which days of the week will be best for working in your garden.\n\n: Spring is the best time of year to start digging, but it\u2019s also the rainiest time of year.

Wear soft kneepads: All that time kneeling and digging can do a number on your knees. A simple pair of kneepads will prevent a lot of soreness. If you want to avoid kneeling altogether, there are a variety of garden stools, some of which function as tool caddies as well.\n\nStudies show that EMFs can skew your body\u2019s biological clock \u2013 causing fatigue and sleeping disorders \u2013 and disrupt your blood sugar management. On top of all of these health benefits, let\u2019s not forget that after a long season of love and labor, you get a bounty of fresh fruits, vegetables, herbs and flowers. So many, in fact, that you may have to share them with your neighbors, friends and family.If you are new to gardening, or you want to get back into it, here are some tips to help you get started as soon as today:\n\nOther Green Activities\n\nVisit local parks and nature trails: Most parks have walking trails and paths. If you live near several parks, make it a goal to explore all the trails. If you live far from a park, I encourage to walk outside wherever you can \u2013 even if it\u2019s a stroll down your street or road.\n\nMost parks have walking trails and paths.

Visit farmers\u2019 markets: If your grocery store doesn\u2019t have affordable organic options, chances are that a farmers\u2019 market will. You\u2019ll find a variety of fresh produce, and also baked goods and arts and crafts made by the very people selling them. Farmers\u2019 markets are a great way to be outside and buy fresh organic food, all while investing in your local community.\n\nIf your grocery store doesn\u2019t have affordable organic options, chances are that a farmers\u2019 market will.

Go on long picnics: Pack up some food, grab a comfortable blanket or some chairs and spend the day enjoying the outdoors. Bring binoculars, books, cards, walking shoes, whatever you want. Just don\u2019t eat and leave. Switch up the food and picnic locations so you aren\u2019t having the same meal at the same spot all the time.\n\nPack up some food, grab a comfortable blanket or some chairs and spend the day enjoying the outdoors.

Heck, it\u2019s likely that your phone has a better camera than the actual camera you had 10 years ago. And they allow you to zoom in on a single flower or zoom out for a panoramic view of a sunset. Put together a \u201cnature photography scavenger hunt\u201d in which you have to go out and take pictures of wildlife, flora, lakes, sunrises, sunsets, pastures and more. These pictures can be framed and hung in your house as a reminder to spend more time outside\u2026and that you\u2019re a budding artist with your own gallery!\n\nWhile gardening is one of the best green activities, there are many others. Consider making one or more of the following activities a part of your spring green routine.\n\nSpring into Action!\n\nReferences\n\nIf you\u2019re in one of the northern states, you know this past winter was long, cold and cruel. I\u2019m ecstatic that it\u2019s over. But I\u2019m even more thrilled about the idea of being outside more\u2014whether it\u2019s digging in my garden or walking at my local park. Being outdoors, especially in the wake of this bone-chilling winter, is a great way to tone up your body and brain and shake off the winter blues.", "description": "At some point we\u2019ve forgotten how fun it is to .09/02/2019 3:01:39AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
