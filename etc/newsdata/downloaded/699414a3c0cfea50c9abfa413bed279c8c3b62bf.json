Biden \u201cwas only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\u201d\n\nAt a raucous rally in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Mr. Trump went after Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter, over the younger Biden\u2019s lucrative deals with a Ukrainian gas company and with China while the father was vice president.\n\n\u201cI want to see Hunter asked these questions: \u2018You know nothing about anything, frankly, Hunter, you\u2019re a loser. Why did you get $1.5 billion [from China], Hunter?\u201d\n\nMr. Trump went on, \u201cAnd your father was never considered smart. He was never considered a good senator. He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\u201d\n\nThe president said he would \u201clove\u201d to run against Mr. Biden.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t beat him in a debate, you\u2019ve got a big problem,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s totally owned and totally controlled by the Washington swamp.\u201d\n\nThe president went with criticism that Hunter Biden has now dropped out of public view since the controversy arose.\n\n\u201cJoe\u2019s son Hunter got thrown out of the Navy and then he became a genius on Wall Street in about two days,\u201d he said. By the way, what the hell ever happened to Hunter? Where is he? Let\u2019s do another t-shirt: Where\u2019s Hunter?\u201d\n\nThe president also referred to a report in the Washington Examiner Thursday night that the anonymous whistleblower who launched the impeachment inquiry against him had worked with Mr. Biden in the White House.\n\n\u201cIn a brand-new report, just came out as I\u2019m walking on the stage, hard to believe, actually, it turns out that [when] Joe Biden was vice president, he worked with the so-called whistleblower,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThis is nothing but a partisan witch hunt, sabotage. And I\u2019m sure they [the media] are going to say it\u2019s a totally unsubstantiated story.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
