That\u2019s why Golden State signing Marquese Chriss to an unguaranteed contract seemingly carried little significance. For Chriss to make the regular-season roster, the Warriors would have to trade someone with a guaranteed salary or waive Alfonzo McKinnie, who might start at small forward.\n\nBut Chriss has drawn a backing.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMarcus Thompson II of The Athletic:\n\nNot long after the Warriors\u2019 first preseason game, there was a meeting somewhere in the bowels of Chase Center. It wasn\u2019t a meeting, sources said, as much as it was a petition, a reiteration, an emphasis, to Warriors general manager Bob Myers. The request was simple in scope. Yet, it was also profound, considering it included an important voice in the locker room, considering it was about a player many have given up on. The request? Get Marquese Chriss on this team.\n\nThompson doesn\u2019t name that \u201cimportant voice in the locker room,\u201d but quotes Draymond Green:\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s been great all training camp,\u201d Draymond Green said. \u201cHe\u2019s been on a couple teams, and everybody has kind of written him off. But he\u2019s been amazing in camp, and to me it looked like he\u2019s figuring it out and he\u2019s turning a corner.\u201d\n\nGreen \u2013 who has touted his salary-cap savviness \u2013 should realize how difficult it\u2019d be to keep Chriss.\n\nMaybe another team would take No. 39 pick Alen Smailagic or No. 41 pick Eric Paschall off Golden State\u2019s hands. But teams rarely throw away second-rounders so quickly.\n\nChriss was also available at the unguaranteed minimum for a reason. The No. 8 pick in the 2016 NBA draft, he has some raw tools. But he has been so undisciplined with the Suns, Rockets and Cavaliers.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the Warriors\u2019 preseason opener against the Lakers, Chriss had eight points, six rebounds and four assists in 14 minutes. That\u2019s not enough to make much judgment, especially considering the far longer track record of dismal regular-season production. Perhaps, the 22-year-old Chriss has shown more signs of progress behind the scenes.\n\nI still doubt Chriss makes the regular-season roster. If he doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll see how that goes over with the \u201cimportant voice in the locker room.\u201d\n\nIf Chriss does make it, Golden State faces another interesting roster move to clear room.", "description": "By acquiring D'Angelo Russell in a sign-and-trade, the Warriors hard-capped themselves for the rest of the season.", "authors": ["Dan Feldman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8Lrd0chqvcCKvlqZcExSrA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CJ.Gn7d8kQA3HpRKm7BNKQ--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/18dc8759ce0fa86a86c83ac87f4fbce3", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
