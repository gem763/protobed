That\u2019s their message to the jury,\u201d Lewis said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to impeach the president of the United States, overturn an election, so I think they [Democrats] need to go back to the drawing board and proceed a little more orderly.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Adam Shaw contributed to this report.", "description": "Former U.S. Attorney Guy Lewis told \"America's Newsroom\"\u00a0on Tuesday that the Trump administration\u00a0is \u201cdrawing a line in the sand\" by blocking\u00a0the U.S. ambassador to the European Union from testifying in a House impeachment deposition on the Ukraine controversy.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-08-at-11.19.17-AM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
