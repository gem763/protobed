Investors voted with their feet and headed for the safe havens as stocks dropped more than 1% and today isn\u2019t shaping up to be much better.\n\nTraders may or may not agree with Trump\u2019s assessment on the cause of the manufacturing decline \u2013 a case can clearly be made for both and the reality is it\u2019s probably a combination of the two \u2013 but the data certainly increased the probability of another cut this year, in their mind.\n\nOdds shifted from just below 70% to above 80% by the end of the year. I imagine there\u2019ll be plenty more movement here in the weeks to come and this Friday could bring fireworks.\n\nBoris \u2013 It\u2019s my deal or no-deal\n\nThe spotlight is never too far away from Brexit and when it is, it\u2019s not for long. Today, Boris Johnson will offer proposals to the EU in a final attempt to tempt them away from the backstop. Early reports based on various leaks don\u2019t suggest his chances are very high but with the PM believed to be offering a take it or leave it ultimatum, the temperature in Brussels will almost certainly ramp up a few notches.\n\nSterling is looking vulnerable again as we embark on a critical two week period for Brexit. It had enjoyed a rebound in September as traders basked in the glory of Parliament apparently blocking no-deal. As we reach the crunch moment though, doubts seem to be creeping in as Boris is adamant we are leaving on Oct. 31, deal or no deal.\n\nGold testing prior support as Fed cut odds rise\n\nJust as it looked down and out, the U.S. ISM manufacturing PMI gave us a swift reminder that will always maintain some appeal. Having touched a low just below $1,460 yesterday, gold is already back testing $1,480 from below, a level that provided so much support since the middle of August.\n\nShould $1,480 hold, then this could be another bearish signal for gold and confirm the initial breakout, putting focus back on $1,460 and below.\n\nGold Daily Chart\n\nGold Daily Chart\n\nOil lower despite inventory decline\n\nare relatively flat so far today, despite API reporting an unexpectedly large drawdown of 5.92 million barrels on Tuesday. The U.S. PMI report on Tuesday may have soured the API data, with it just reaffirming fears of a global economic slowdown, in turn lowering global growth and demand expectations. We\u2019re still hovering above the lows but, given the bullish factors that are being overlooked right now, they may be under threat.\n\nDaily Chart\n\nBrent Daily Chart\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Stocks Analysis by MarketPulse (Craig Erlam) covering: XAU/USD, Gold Futures, Brent Oil Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
