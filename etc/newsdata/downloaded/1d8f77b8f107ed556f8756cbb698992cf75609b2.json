Some 200 Extinction Rebellion protesters were outside the building attempting to disrupt the day\u2019s flights. Police were on all doors blocking access to anyone who could not prove they were there to catch a plane.\n\nAs Mr Larsen-Daw headed for the entrance, visibly shaking his head at the demonstrators, one such officer asked to see his passport. The 38-year-old replied that he was on a domestic flight. So, he was asked to open his suitcase.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cI did it straight away, very confident and officious, thinking he\u2019d just see the clothes I\u2019d packed on top,\u201d the 38-year-old tells The Independent two hours later. \u201cBut the false bottom I\u2019d made had come loose. I opened the suitcase up and my climate change placard was right there poking through some pants and socks.\u201d\n\nHe muses on this. \u201cIt was a bit of a giveaway.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

manager\u2019s attempts to infiltrate the London airport as part of a planned Hong Kong-style shut down ended prematurely. Instead of occupying the departure lounge, he spent the day with crowds barricading the building from outside.\n\nYet his creativity in attempting to gently circumnavigate authorities to cause maximum disruption is perhaps somehow symptomatic of this week\u2019s protests in London.\n\nTime and again, police appear to have been wrong-footed \u2013 or at least kept occupied \u2013 by the sheer peaceful ingenuity of the estimated 30,000 self-proclaimed rebels who have descended on the capital to demand action on climate change.\n\nIn the first week of a planned fortnight of direct action \u2013 being repeated in 60 cities across the globe \u2013 protesters have eschewed formulaic rallies and marches, and gone with tactics altogether more unorthodox.\n\nRoads have been blockaded by mass breastfeeds; weddings held on occupied bridges (\u201cin love and in rage\u201d, ran the vows); and Westminster brought to a virtual standstill with the sudden coordinated placing of almost 1,000 pot plants outside parliament.\n\nStatues across the capital have been scaled and given eco-warrior flags, while sprawling tent cities have sprung up in Trafalgar Square, St James\u2019s Park and Vauxhall Gardens \u2013 complete with morning yoga sessions, vegan lunch stations and stalls organising volunteers into jobs. Wanted, says a sign outside the latter: waste management supporters, leafleteers, arrestables.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

A Paralympian, in a feat frankly worthy of a gold medal, climbed on an aeroplane in a bid to keep it grounded. Especially impressive after he revealed he was scared of heights.\n\nThe day before that, a 74-year-old was arrested for sounding a fire alarm at an oil and money conference at Park Lane Hotel. Not that he\u2019s the oldest person detained. A 91-year-old was taken into custody on Thursday for refusing to move from outside the Cabinet Office in Whitehall. \u201cTeenagers nowadays,\u201d said John Lynes as he was escorted into a police van. \u201cWhat future have they got?\u201d\n\nSuch has been the originality of these protests, journalists have arrived from across Europe to report on them. Although this may be a somewhat pyrrhic victory. \u201cI flew in,\u201d a reporter from Germany\u2019s Das Spiegel newspaper tells me at the London City airport protest. \u201cNot ideal, I admit.\u201d\n\nWriting on Monday, the commentator Brendan O\u2019Neill called all this a \u201cdeath cult\u201d. It takes some skill to squeeze two inaccuracies into two words but this just about achieves it.\n\nFirstly, any objective observer spending time in London this week could not mistake this for a cult. It is, demonstrably, a mass movement.\n\nThe people here are of all ages, all professions and from all parts of the UK. They range on a spectrum from self-identifying \u201cuncooperative crusties\u201d to a former Met Police detective, John Curran, caught on camera explaining to officers arresting him that, strictly speaking, they had put his handcuffs on wrong. \u201cI break the law with an open heart and honesty,\u201d he says.\n\nSecondly, this is not a movement preoccupied by death. It appears, rather, to be absolutely in love with life.\n\nThe three stated aims of its disruption \u2013 for the government to declare a climate emergency, reduce carbon emissions to zero, and create a people\u2019s assembly \u2013 are, participants reckon, all about preserving humanity.\n\n\u201cWe are doing this because we care so much for the planet and for the future of people on it,\u201d says Victoria Valentine, a property company CEO from Lincolnshire. \u201cWe are doing it from a place of love and goodness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent years trying to effect change through the ways we\u2019re told to \u2013 writing to MPs, supporting Greenpeace, signing petitions \u2013 and all of it has been ignored. So, what else is left but direct action?\u201d\n\nHer daughter, Phoebe, 23, a maths student, was arrested for gluing herself to the floor of London City airport\u2019s Docklands Light Railway station. \u201cI\u2019m a parent, so of course I don\u2019t want to see her taken by police \u2013 I worry about that impacting her future,\u201d the mother-of-four says. \u201cBut I\u2019m also very proud of her for standing up for what she believes in.\u201d\n\nPhoebe herself emerges from the police station at midnight with bail conditions, which order her not to catch the Tube or trains within the M25. \u201cAt least I\u2019ve still got my bike,\u201d she says a little ruefully.\n\nWas it worth it? \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nThis was a view oft-repeated by those arrested.\n\n\u201cWhat does having a criminal record matter if there\u2019s no future for the planet anyway?\u201d asks one protester, Dylan Jones, a 28-year-old trainee accountant from Bristol. \u201cI\u2019d rather not have a record. I\u2019m not the kind of person to generally make a fuss about things. But climate change is real and it\u2019s urgent. We\u2019re on the brink of events \u2013 weather pattern changes, flooding, major extinctions \u2013 that we cannot comprehend and we can\u2019t reverse. Coming back positive on a DBS check pales into significance against that.\u201d\n\nBy Friday afternoon, he was among more than 1,200 people who had been detained by police. Yet the problem for the Met was that, once released, many of those were simply returning to the campsites and front lines where they\u2019d vowed to spend the fortnight.\n\nSomething similar applied to seized equipment. As officers confiscated tents and generators, more arrived in other locations, funded by crowdsourcing and an increasing number of donors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got all sorts in here,\u201d says Abdi Sherif, manning a free equipment gazebo in Trafalgar Square. \u201cSleeping bags, mats, tents, flasks, toothpaste. Very important, toothpaste.\u201d\n\nThe 32-year-old himself had been there four nights when we spoke. He\u2019d taken two weeks off work at McDonald\u2019s to take part. \u201cI\u2019m running on adrenalin and coffee now but I can\u2019t think of a more important cause.\u201d\n\nAs the first week passed into the weekend, this was a view shared by Extinction Rebellion\u2019s co-founder Gail Bradbrook. \u201cI think the most important thing,\u201d she tells reporters, \u201cis that we are alerting the British people to the crisis that we\u2019re in.\u201d", "description": "Matt Larsen-Daw arrived at London City airport, like thousands of business passengers every day, dressed in a suit and tie\u00a0and pulling his suitcase along.", "authors": ["Colin Drury"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/11/10/Extinction-Rebellion-city-airport-indy-37.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
