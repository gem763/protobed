Starship is meant to fly hundreds of passengers to deep-space destinations like the Moon and Mars. Flanked by a giant prototype of the vehicle, Musk vowed that Starship could fly to orbit as soon as six months from now, and carry its first passengers sometime next year.\n\n\u201cThis thing is going to take off, fly to 65,000 feet \u2014 about 20 kilometers \u2014 and come back and land in about one to two months,\u201d Musk said, referring to the stainless steel prototype behind him. The giant test article stood next to a SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket, the first vehicle the company put into orbit. The staging was symbolic, especially since the presentation occurred on the anniversary of SpaceX\u2019s first flight to orbit with the Falcon 1.\n\nThe giant test article stood next to a SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket\n\nThe test rocket in Boca Chica towers over 165 feet (50 meters) tall and has three of SpaceX\u2019s next generation Raptor engines attached to its base. Its goal is to test out the launch and landing capabilities that the final Starship vehicle will need to be a fully reusable system. The prototype will use its engines to fly to a high altitude and then lower itself back down, performing what\u2019s known as a propulsive landing \u2014 the same technique SpaceX uses to land its currently operational rockets.\n\nSpaceX still has a lot of work to do to get this thing flying on such a short timescale. The Starship prototype makes for an impressive sight on the ground. It\u2019ll be even more of a spectacle when it finally takes to the skies.", "description": "On Saturday night, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk gave a presentation in Boca Chica, Texas, on the development of his company\u2019s next generation rocket, called Starship, meant to fly hundreds of passengers to deep-space destinations like the Moon and Mars.
