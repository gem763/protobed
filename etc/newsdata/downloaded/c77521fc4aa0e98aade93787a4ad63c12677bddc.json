Now that it\u2019s a plot point, I honestly can\u2019t believe it\u2019s taken so long. That\u2019s right people, in a moment of chaos in a trauma room, Owen plays fast and loose with those juiced-up paddles, \u201cdoesn\u2019t realize\u201d Tom Koracick is right behind him and, as Tom so eloquently puts it, Owen deep-fries Tom\u2019s nads. Owen attempts to apologize while Tom recovers, but there is only bad blood between these two thanks to the Teddy Of It All, and Tom slaps Owen with a restraining order. I don\u2019t much care about this either way, but come on, a little ball frying on Grey\u2019s Anatomy is just what we needed.\n\nOtherwise, \u201cBack in the Saddle\u201d is mostly an episode designed to set up some major storylines for the season. The one that will surely have the longest effect on the show is that of Amelia and Link and that whole Amelia being pregnant thing. Link is basically shocked into paralysis and seeks his friend Jo\u2019s advice. Because of a childhood spent fighting cancer and watching his parents fight\u2026 and also, climate change, Link is extremely apprehensive to have a child. Though, of course, he knows this is ultimately Amelia\u2019s choice.\n\nWhen he and Amelia finally have a sit down, she tells him about Christopher and explains that she\u2019d never survive something like that again and she doesn\u2019t want to risk it happening. And then Link goes and says that he never wants to see her hurting so if she wants to have this baby, he is in, despite his fears, and if she doesn\u2019t\u2014well, he\u2019s still in, any way that he can be there for her, he will be. These are lovely, perfect words coming out of a lovely, perfect face, so it\u2019s no wonder that by the end of the episode, Amelia tells Link that she didn\u2019t want to have a baby because she was scared, but then he said those lovely, perfect things and she wasn\u2019t so scared anymore. In fact, she kind of wants to meet their kid. Link kind of does, too. So it looks like we\u2019re having another Grey-Sloan baby! Man, that place is Fertile Factory.\n\nAmelia\u2019s sister and medical outlaw Meredith Grey is also making a possibly life-changing decision tonight. While awaiting her medical license hearing scheduled for three months from now (hm, right around winter hiatus?), Meredith continues to administer medical treatment to other people performing community service hours with her. She basically becomes a walk-in clinic for her fellow lawbreakers. The more people she tends to, the more she hears awful stories about insurance problems that stop people from seeking out the medical care they need. She knows she\u2019s supposed to \u201clay low\u201d until her hearing, but she decides she wants to write and publish an article about all the people slipping through the cracks of the medical insurance system. This is basically the opposite of \u201claying low.\u201d She is sure to ruffle some feathers, which, honestly, is what Meredith does best.\n\nMeanwhile, the woman who taught Meredith Grey (almost) everything she knows has decided to stop wallowing about firing all of her best doctors (and friends!) and get! Her! Groove back! Medically speaking, that is. Yes, Bailey\u2019s been a mope about losing Webber, Alex, and Meredith, and she\u2019s been out of sorts since Catherine made Tom her boss, but Ben reminds her that she\u2019s Miranda Freakin\u2019 Bailey and she doesn\u2019t let any man steal her joy! And what, exactly, is Bailey\u2019s greatest joy? Making kickass surgeons. She finally remembers that she made Meredith and Alex who they are today, and that means she can make more extremely talented surgeons. Old Bailey is back, baby!\n\nShe decides to get tough on her residents and runs a little boot camp competition with them to see who rises to the top. It\u2019s DeLuca who ends up giving her the most trouble, comparing her techniques to Meredith\u2019s, arguing with her when she picks Helm to perform a tricky surgery over him, and then, after Helm royally screws up and DeLuca has to swoop in during surgery and save a patient, YELLING at her about her decision-making skills and ACCUSING her of punishing him for dating Meredith. Honestly, how dare he.\n\nBailey puts him in his place, of course, and tells him never to question her methods\u2014Helm needed to learn about being scared in the OR and working under pressure and Bailey knows exactly what she\u2019s doing thank you very much. I mean, it\u2019s like DeLuca never watched Grey\u2019s Anatomy season 1 through 11 to learn about the greatness that is Miranda Bailey before he arrived on the scene. Anyway, Bailey got her joy back.\n\nLaughter is the Best Medicine, Apart From Real Medicine\n\n\u2022 Okay, I guess I\u2019ll buy that Schmitt is a Gryffindor, although he seems more like a Hufflepuff to me (and that\u2019s not a knock\u2014after years and quizzes spent trying to avoid it, I am a proud Hufflepuff myself), but Jackson? Oh no. Jackson is probably a Ravenclaw\u2026 but possibly a Slytherin, especially after all that #freedom bull he pulled on Instagram. Seriously, Jackson? #Freedom? SERIOUSLY. You don\u2019t deserve Maggie Pierce!\n\n\u2022 Oh, okay, Jo Karev. She uses a job offer from Alex as leverage to get a General Surgery Attending position (and a parking spot) out of Bailey. Get yours, lady.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t you kind of love seeing Alex Karev and Richard Webber teaming up to save a hospital from itself? Like, way back in season one, could you ever have imagined such a storyline? What a delight! Pac-North won\u2019t know what hit it (in a good way).\n\n\u2022 Who is this fifth-year resident Tom Koracick has brought to us all the way from Johns Hopkins, and which doctor will he be hooking up with first?\n\n\u2022 Whenever I\u2019m sad, I\u2019m just going to think about Ben and Bailey eating doughnuts and giggling in bed.", "description": "Bailey gets her groove back (medically speaking), Meredith does the opposite of laying low, and Owen shocks Tom.
