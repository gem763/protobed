Since being posted only 12 hours ago, the post has amassed a whopping 228,000 likes and 141,000 shares. Maritza\u2019s post has also picked up more than 180 comments, mostly from people tagging their friends in the utter madness that is this viral photo.\n\nThanks to the night-vision camera on her baby monitor and the weird, creepy child face on the mattress, Martiza was left looking at a truly terrifying sight when she tried to check up on her son throughout the night.\n\nUnlike many \u201cghost\u201d sightings that are blurry and questionable, this nightmare-inducing image clearly shows why Maritza was losing sleep. This wasn\u2019t taken on a fucking toaster, this is clear as day. There is a DEMON in her child\u2019s bed.\n\nUpon further investigation in the morning, Maritza realised it was merely her husband forgetting to put a mattress protector on the bed. I\u2019m assuming the only ghost floating around that house at the moment is Maritza\u2019s husband after she murders him for this terrifying mistake.\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure why the mattress manufacturer felt the need to have a baby\u2019s face on their product, as if people don\u2019t know where the baby is supposed to go. Surely this isn\u2019t the first time someone has been spooked by this, right?\n\nHonestly, at this point I\u2019d throw the whole thing out. The bed, the husband, the baby. Okay, maybe she shouldn\u2019t throw out her husband and infant child, but she should at least sage the absolute shit out of her entire life.\n\nIt\u2019s October, which means it\u2019s officially the *spooky* season, but if this is what the universe has in store for in the lead up to Halloween, I think I\u2019d rather just skip ahead until Christmas. Good luck getting any sleep tonight, folks.", "description": "A mother has gone viral on Facebook after mistaking the mattress label on her son's crib for a ghost baby after her husband forgot the mattress protector.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/maritza1-e1571473735426.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
