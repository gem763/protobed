He also accused Democrats of deploying the \u201cpolitics of personal destruction\u201d in their handling of both sets of allegations.\n\n2020 DEMOCRATS IGNORE KAVANAUGH STORY CORRECTION AFTER DEMANDING IMPEACHMENT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just as transparent and self-serving today,\u201d McConnell said. In his blistering floor speech, he went on to rebuke several Senate Democrats for a recent brief that urged the Supreme Court to \u201cheal itself\u201d or face restructuring \u2013 which was widely seen as a threat of court-packing.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is not normal political behavior,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Judiciary Committee chairman who mounted one of the most passionate defenses of Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing, called the attacks \u201cbeyond the pale.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy heart goes out to Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s family for being forced to endure this ridiculous treatment once again,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nMany of the Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump in 2020 over the weekend released statements calling for Congress to impeach Kavanaugh, citing The New York Times' reporting of a disputed allegation of sexual misconduct. But Graham insisted that wouldn't happen.\n\n\u201cAs chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I promise you Justice Kavanaugh will not be impeached over these scurrilous accusations,\u201d Graham tweeted.\n\nIowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, who led the Judiciary Committee during the Kavanaugh hearings, said his office never \"received an allegation against Kavanaugh like the one referenced in the report over the weekend.\"\n\n\"We now have an uncorroborated accusation, rooted only in unnamed sources, with no direct knowledge of the event, and that the alleged victim doesn\u2019t even remember,\" Grassley said. \"Since when did that become something 'fit to print' by the supposed American paper of record?\"\n\nBy late Sunday, the paper had revised its portrayed blockbuster story to include the fact that several friends of the alleged victim said she told them she did not recall the reported sexual assault in question.\n\nPresident Trump repeatedly ripped the paper on Monday.\n\n\"The New York Times should close its doors and throw away the keys,\" he tweeted Monday afternoon, reacting to quotes from Fox News' Greg Gutfeld. \"The women mentioned in the Kavanaugh story said she didn\u2019t even remember the event.\"\n\nAs for Democrats, California Sen. Kamala Harris, who said over the weekend that Kavanaugh \u201cmust be impeached,\u201d did not back down in a new tweet Monday, writing: \u201cThe reality of Kavanaugh's confirmation process is that it lacked any integrity \u2014 there has never been a meaningful investigation into these allegations. We need the truth.\u201d\n\nThe Times piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate, Clinton-connected nonprofit CEO Max Stier, \u201csaw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\u201d\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro tweeted in response: \u201cIt\u2019s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath. He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote: \u201cLast year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.\u201d\n\nNYT UPDATES KAVANAUGH 'BOMBSHELL' TO NOTE ACCUSER DOESN'T RECALL ALLEGED ASSAULT\n\nWhile 2020 Democrats did not back down from their impeachment calls, despite the Times revision, top Democrats in Congress appeared less eager.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., seemed to brush off his party's calls to launch impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh, saying on a radio show Monday: \u201cWe have our hands full with impeaching the president right now.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters: \u201cI am saying nothing on Kavanaugh right now.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Judson Berger, Chad Pergram and Gregory Re contributed to this report.", "description": "Senate Republican leaders on Monday unloaded on Democrats over their revived efforts to push uncorroborated college-era allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell accusing them of engaging in \u201cnot normal political behavior.\u201d", "authors": ["Alex Pappas", "Alex Pappas Is Senior Politics Editor At Foxnews.Com."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/16/694940094001_6086821389001_6086824496001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
