REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nWall Street equity indexes were buffeted in early trading, moving to early highs and then quickly paring gains on conflicting reports about whether Trump administration officials had considered offering a limited trade deal to China.\n\n\u201cMarkets are still on the trade war seesaw today,\u201d said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. \u201cWe had some good news on trade which is why markets are up, but the seesaw may drop on any signs of failure.\u201d\n\nStocks have drawn support from signs of a thaw in tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies, including China\u2019s announcement of some tariff exemptions on Wednesday.\n\nAhead of in-person talks, the United States welcomed China\u2019s pledge to buy agricultural goods, though the threat of tariff hikes remained.\n\nChinese importers made their largest U.S. soybean purchases since at least June, traders told Reuters.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 46.02 points, or 0.17%, to 27,183.06, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 8.71 points, or 0.29%, to 3,009.64 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 24.79 points, or 0.3%, to 8,194.47.\n\nStocks in Europe were also whipsawed by the trade reports after climbing on the ECB policy statement. The broad STOXX 600 index rose as much as 0.75% before closing with a modest advance as banks pared gains.\n\nThe European Central Bank promised an indefinite supply of fresh asset purchases and cut interest rates deeper into negative territory to support the economy.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.20% to close at its highest level since July 29 and MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.39%.\n\nEuro zone bond yields fell and the euro weakened following the ECB announcement but both eventually reversed course as the stimulus measures failed to live up to market expectations and investors reacted to trade headlines.\n\nAfter falling as low as a negative 0.124%, 30-year German yields DE30YT=RR were last at a negative 0.017% after moving into positive territory earlier this week.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY, tracking the unit against six major currencies, fell 0.28%, with the euro EUR= up 0.51% to $1.1065.\n\nTrade optimism also pushed yields on U.S. Treasuries higher after early declines in sync with European bonds.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 13/32 in price to yield 1.7785%, from 1.733% late on Wednesday. Yields rose further as soft demand at a $16 billion 30-year government auction touched off selling in the U.S. bond market.\n\nBond market focus now turns to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is expected to cut rates next Wednesday.", "description": "A gauge of global stock markets rose for a seventh straight day in choppy trading on Thursday after hints of progress in the U.S.-China trade dispute, pushing bond yields off lows hit earlier on the heels of new stimulus measures put forth by the European Central Bank.", "authors": ["Chuck Mikolajczak", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429118111&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B1IE"}
