Two deaths are also being investigated.\n\nWhile no conclusive connection has been proven, authorities there are beginning to take action. Flavoured vaping products have been banned for six months in Michigan, while city officials in Milwaukee issued a health warning telling people to stop vaping altogether.\n\nA chest X-ray from one of the people in the U.S. suffering from a pulmonary illness. (Intermountain Healthcare)\n\nHealth Canada says there have been no reported cases of illness here, but on Wednesday issued a statement urging those who vape to be cautious and warning young people, pregnant women and non-smokers not to vape at all.\n\nRestrictions around vaping products were put in place when the products were legalized last year, James Van Loon, director general of Health Canada's Tobacco Control Directorate, told The Current.\n\nHe said that vaping products \"are a less harmful alternative to nicotine, if you switch completely from smoking, which is the leading cause of preventable death and illness in Canada.\"\n\nHe added that \"more can be done to prevent youth uptake,\" and Health Canada was working to put those measures in place \"as quickly as possible.\"\n\nA new generation is getting hooked on nicotine, and doctors say there are alarming similarities between the past popularity of cigarettes and the current vaping trend. 4:18\n\nHe said that Health Canada is \"carefully monitoring\" the situation in the U.S. and \"actively\" looking for similar cases in Canada, using \"all of our information sources for possible cases.\"\n\nThose sources include \"federally accessible databases like consumer complaints about vaping products or drug adverse reaction reports,\" he said.\n\nHe also said chief medical officers across the country are being asked to watch for symptoms, and to ask \"people about their vaping history if they're coming in with any kind of a respiratory illness.\"\n\nHe urged people who \"are using vaping products or have used them in the past, [to] just monitor yourself carefully.\"\n\n\"If you end up with difficulty breathing or severe illness \u2026 make sure that you talk to your doctor about what that is.\"\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran.
