It's always been a painful history,\" said Elamin, referencing the long history of people darkening their skin for performance or entertainment.\n\n\"Every time that we talk about brownface or blackface it's an uncomfortable conversation. And we are gonna have to get uncomfortable today.\"\n\n'There are so many conversations we're not having'\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau is shown in this 2001 photo published in the yearbook of West Point Grey Academy, a private school where Trudeau was teaching at the time. (Time.com)\n\nOn Wednesday Trudeau also admitted that the incident was not isolated, recalling an event in which he sang Day O in a high school talent show while wearing dark makeup.\n\n\"It was something that I didn't think was racist at the time, but now I recognize it was something racist to do and I am deeply sorry,\" he said, adding that he \"should have known better.\"\n\nReporters asked a variety of questions, including how he will explain this situation to his children, but there were at least five prompts that Elamin did not hear in the early hours of the breaking news.\n\nWhy did you think it was OK at the time?\n\nWhen did you realize it was racist?\n\nCan you articulate why it's not okay now?\n\nWhat responsibility do you have in communicating to Canadians that it's not okay?\n\nHow are you going to lead by example?\n\nFor Elamin, this is a moment in which we might open up a difficult but \"useful\" conversation that is uncomfortable for many \u2014 even those who consider themselves defenders of diversity and inclusion.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Trudeau appeared again before a Winnipeg crowd to take another round of questions, including what he was thinking at the time. He said his \"layers of privilege\" prevented him from understanding how hurtful and offensive his costumes have been.\n\n\"Darkening your face, regardless of the context of the circumstances, is always unacceptable because of the racist history of blackface. I should have understood that then, and I never should have done it,\" he said.\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nThe co-hosts walked through the early responses of the various party leaders, including that of NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, the only non-white leader of a major party. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)\n\nLast night, Rosie predicted that this story is far from over.\n\n\"Of course the most important thing is how Canadians react and how voters respond. But, you know, over the next few days it will be about how the opposition tries to frame this,\" she said.\n\nAt the same time, both hosts are hopeful that a more thoughtful, nuanced discussion could be born of this situation.\n\n\"It may still happen. Sometimes from these ugly, painful moments you can push a conversation in the right direction. And maybe that's what will define leadership in the coming days,\" said Rosie.\n\nWant to keep up with Party Lines?
