I thank you all for giving me an unbelievable career. God bless you all.\u201d\n\nBenn held the WBO middleweight title in 1990 and the WBC super-middleweight title from 1992-96. He lost his last professional fight to Irishman Steve Collins in November 1996.\n\n\u201cI had to call it quits today, I wanted a hard spar, but it just wasn\u2019t happening,\u201d Benn added. \u201cMy shoulder started playing up and I could not throw a right hand at all.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s the day I hand over the baton to my son Conor, who is going to carry on the name, but with me it comes to an end today.\u201d\n\nBritish media reported earlier this month that Benn\u2019s comeback bid had been opposed by the British Boxing Board of Control, and that the bout was sanctioned by the rival British and Irish Boxing Authority instead.", "description": "Former world boxing champion Nigel Benn has called off his bid to make a comeback to the ring 23 years after his last professional fight due to a shoulder injury.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446042597&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S04E", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
