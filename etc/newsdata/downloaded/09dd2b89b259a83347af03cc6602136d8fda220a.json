Bush-like restraint in pushing back; others recommended a full-throated Trump-esque denial.\n\nREAD EXCERPT FROM 'JUSTICE ON TRIAL,' DETAILING KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION DRAMA\n\nAfter one aide, on that September 2018 day of his testimony, suggested Kavanaugh be gentle in talking about accuser Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s allegations, a fired-up White House counsel Don McGahn demanded everyone leave the Capitol Hill war room where the nominee was preparing. \u201cEveryone!\u201d McGahn shouted, even prompting Kavanaugh\u2019s wife, Ashley, to get up, before being told she could stay.\n\nThese and other newly reported details about Kavanaugh's fiery confirmation process are included in the forthcoming book \u201cJustice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court,\u201d written by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino. The book is set for release Tuesday.\n\nKavanaugh, that day, opted for the latter approach. Visibly emotional and angry, Kavanaugh told senators on the Judiciary Committee that he was being falsely accused and his name had been \"totally and permanently destroyed\" by these \"false\" allegations.\n\nHe was responding to the testimony that same day from Ford, who maintained she's \"100 percent\" sure he tried to force himself on her 36 years earlier.\n\n\"Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life,\" Ford told the committee.\n\nKavanaugh's decision to discard deference for Democratic senators and passionately fight back against the allegations may have helped save his nomination. But the book reports that Kavanaugh\u2019s advisers were split on how he should approach that day.\n\nEMOTIONAL KAVANAUGH DECRIES \u2018CIRCUS\u2019 AND MAINTAINS INNOCENCE, AS FORD TESTIFIES HE \u2018SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ME\u2019\n\n\u201cKavanaugh had been deluged with advice until the end. His Bush friends, by and large, told him ... not to show too much emotion,\u201d Hemingway and Severino wrote. \u201cBut he received calls from a few senators encouraging him to show his righteous indignation.\u201d\n\nHemingway is a writer at the Federalist website and a Fox News contributor. Severino is the chief counsel of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, which advocated for Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination.\n\nThe authors reported that McGahn, who worked to shepherd the nomination through Congress, was worried there were \u201ctoo many people\u201d telling Kavanaugh \u201ctoo many things.\u201d\n\nThey also detailed how Kavanaugh tore up his planned opening remarks the day before the hearing, after anti-Trump lawyer Michael Avenatti went public with allegations from a client claiming Kavanaugh was involved in gang rapes in high school \u2013 an accusation Kavanaugh later dismissed as a \u201cfarce.\u201d\n\nKavanaugh finished writing his remarks the night before, the authors wrote, but made one addition the day of the testimony \u2013 adding a story about his daughter Liza saying they should pray for Blasey Ford.\n\n\u201cHe added a note with a black Sharpie permanent marker, his editing tool of choice. Having learned from practice that some parts of the speech would be hard to make it through, he had indicated with his Sharpie where to stop to breathe,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nThe book acknowledges one misstep Kavanaugh made in front of the cameras that day after Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar asked him if he\u2019s ever had so much to drink he could not remember the previous evening. \u201cHave you?\u201d an annoyed Kavanagh shot back.\n\nDuring a recess, Kavanaugh\u2019s wife told him to clean up his comments.\n\n\u201cAs soon as they returned to the holding room, McGahn told Kavanaugh it was time to reel it in,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cAshley told Kavanaugh to calm down and encouraged him to find a way to address what he had said.\u201d Kavanaugh apologized to Klobuchar after the break.\n\nThe book credits South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s defense of Kavanaugh during the hearing as a major turning point, saying it was \u201ccathartic for those Americans whose views had been sidelined by the media in the previous two weeks.\u201d Graham raised his voice in calling the hearings the \u201cmost unethical sham since I\u2019ve been in politics\u201d and turning to Democrats said, \u201cBoy, y\u2019all want power. God, I hope you never get it.\u201d\n\nAfter the explosive hearing, Kavanaugh took phone calls from both Trump and former President George W. Bush to \u201ccommend him for his testimony,\u201d the book said.\n\n\u201cText messages and emails poured in from people he knew in high school, college, law school, the independent counsel\u2019s office, and the White House. He heard from people he knew during his clerkships and parents of children he had coached,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cIt was a survey of his life\u2019s work, and it was reassuring and encouraging.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Judson Berger contributed to this report.", "description": "A new book details how Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s advisers were split on how he should approach his dramatic hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.", "authors": ["Alex Pappas", "Alex Pappas Is A Senior Politics Editor At Foxnews.Com."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/04/13/694940094001_6025976341001_6025968579001-vs.jpg"}
