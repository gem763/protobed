A reporter showed him a replay on an iPhone, and Robey-Coleman blurted out what everyone involved and everyone watching already knew.\n\n\u201cOh, hell yeah,\u201d Robey-Coleman said. \u201cThat was P.I.\u201d\n\nColeman had watched himself commit blatant pass interference late in the fourth quarter, a penalty the officials neglected to call. The play had seismic effects, both immediate and long-term. The New Orleans Saints had been in position to reach their second Super Bowl, and instead the Rams won the NFC title. The missed call convinced the NFL to make pass interference calls and non-calls reviewable on instant replay.\n\nThe play and its consequences will be revisited Sunday when the Saints meet the Rams for a rematch in Los Angeles. Both teams won their openers, and they are both among the favorites to return to the NFC championship game this January. As the Rams and Saints meet again, here\u2019s a primer on the Nola No-Call that made their last game so indelible.\n\n[Sean Payton is moving the Saints past the NFC Championship no-call, but he hasn't forgotten]\n\nWhat happened on the fateful play?\n\nWith 1:49 left and the score tied at 20, the Saints faced 3rd and 10 from the Rams\u2019 13-yard line. Brees floated a pass to wide receiver Tommylee Lewis, who had lined up in the backfield and run a pattern down the right sideline. Robey-Coleman sprinted from the other side of the field and flattened Lewis well before the ball had arrived. \u201cI just know I got there before the ball got there,\u201d Robey-Coleman said. \u201cAnd I whacked his a--.\u201d\n\nWas the no-call controversial?\n\nOnly in the sense that it inflamed the Saints and their rabid fan base, so much so that multiple lawsuits were filed against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell. But everyone on both sides agreed it was an obviously missed call. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to sit here and say it wasn\u2019t pass interference,\u201d Rams Coach Sean McVay said this week.\n\nSo what happened after the no-call?\n\nWil Lutz kicked a field goal on the very next play that sent the Saints ahead, 23-20.\n\nWait, the Saints went ahead afterward? Didn\u2019t this play cost the Saints the game?\n\nWith a high degree of probability, but not certainty, yes. If the refs had called pass interference, the Saints would have had a new set of downs near the goal line. Coach Sean Payton would have called three quarterback kneels to kill the clock, and Lutz would have had a chip-shot field goal with no time left. Instead, the Rams drove down the field and kicked a field goal to force overtime, where they won.\n\n[NFC title game recap: The Rams advance to Super Bowl on controversial no-call]\n\nOh, so the Saints did get robbed.\n\nYes, but it\u2019s not like they didn\u2019t have chances to win. The Saints led, 13-0, after the first quarter. They may have put the game away early in the second had they not allowed an easy-to-see-coming fake punt. They could have stopped the Rams on the ensuing drive. They also got the ball first in overtime, but Brees threw an interception on a deflected pass. Still, the Saints would have almost certainly won had the obvious call been made.\n\nHow did the NFL respond?\n\nAl Riveron, the league\u2019s head of officials, called Payton immediately after the game and admitted the referees had missed the call. The league later admitted the referees also missed a helmet-to-helmet hit on the play, for which the NFL fined Robey-Coleman $26,739.\n\nGoodell did not address the call for 10 days, until he held his annual news conference during the week of the Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cWe understand the frustration of the fans,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cWe talked to Coach Payton. The team, the players, we understand the frustration that they feel right now. And we certainly want to address them.\n\n\u201cWhenever officiating is part of any kind of discussion postgame, it\u2019s never a good outcome for us. But we also know that our officials are human. We also know they are officiating a game in which they often have to make snap decisions under difficult circumstances. And they\u2019re not going to get it right every time. As I say, they\u2019re human.\u201d\n\nWhat is the play\u2019s lasting impact?\n\nIt changed the legacy of Payton and Brees, who still only have one Super Bowl appearance. More tangibly, it convinced the NFL to change replay rules. With Payton leading the charge from his position on the NFL\u2019s competition committee, NFL teams voted 31-1 to expand instant replay to pass interference. Coaches can challenge plays called pass interference and not called pass interference. It\u2019s the first time judgment calls can be reviewed. The new provisions could be revisited after this season, because owners voted to make them a one-year trial.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nJets quarterback Sam Darnold out indefinitely because of mono\n\nBrewer: Lamar Jackson, Baker Mayfield and the dangers of judging quarterbacks too early", "description": "The Saints and Rams meet Sunday in a rematch of last year's NFC championship, one of the most memorable and consequential games in recent memory.", "authors": ["Adam Kilgore", "Reporter Covering National Sports", "September At Am", "Adam Kilgore Covers National Sports For The Washington Post.
