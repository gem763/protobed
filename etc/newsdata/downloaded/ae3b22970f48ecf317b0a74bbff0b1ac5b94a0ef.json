The premium-TV network, which entered the awards ceremony with the most nominations, led in Emmy wins after tying with its streaming rival Netflix last year.\n\nHBO took home nine of the awards for the final season of \"Game of Thrones,\" the limited series \"Chernobyl,\" the media drama \"Succession,\" and the talk show \"Last Week Tonight With John Oliver.\" It also won 25 Creative Arts Emmy Awards, for a total of 34.\n\nThe Emmys showing bolstered HBO's case as the top home for award-winning TV, even as competitors like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and soon Apple and Disney come for its premium-TV crown.\n\nNetflix won just 4 awards in the telecast, a weak showing ahead of intensified streaming competition\n\nLast year, Netflix tied HBO in Emmy wins, with 23 awards apiece.\n\nThe streaming giant came up short in 2019. Netflix won just four awards in Sunday's Fox telecast \u2014 for \"Ozark,\" \"When They See Us,\" and the interactive \"Black Mirror\" movie, \"Bandersnatch\" \u2014 as well as 23 in the Creative Arts presentations. Overall, it still took home more Emmys than in 2018.\n\nNetflix campaigns hard for Emmy awards to show that its originals can compete on the same stage as those from legacy networks like HBO. Accolades, be they Emmys or Oscars recognition, have become a key part of how Netflix secures top talent, such as the \"When They See Us\" creator Ava DuVernay or the TV hitmakers Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy.\n\nThe company was aided by an estimated $15 billion content budget for 2019, more than other networks that don't carry live sports. Netflix entered the night with the second-most nominations, 118 to HBO's 137. But Netflix originals like \"Russian Doll\" and the final season of \"House of Cards\" were passed up in the awards ceremony, and others like \"When They See Us\" didn't receive widespread recognition.\n\nIts runner-up showing in the telecast comes just as it prepares to face off against forthcoming services from media and tech giants including Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia, and NBCUniversal. WarnerMedia is using the HBO brand as a launch pad for its service, called HBO Max, which is scheduled to debut next April.\n\nAmazon Prime Video was the comedy breakout, thanks to 'Fleabag'\n\nNetflix's streaming rival Amazon Prime Video cleaned up in the comedy categories. Amazon took home seven awards Sunday night to go with eight Creative Arts Emmys in earlier presentations. \"Fleabag\" won four awards in the telecast, \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" nabbed three, and the limited series \"A Very English Scandal\" won one.\n\nOverall, it was a big night for streaming. Hulu won one award in the telecast, for \"The Act.\" And the commercial breaks were blanketed with ads for streaming services, including Prime Video and Disney Plus \u2014 which launched preorders during the show \u2014 as well as Apple TV Plus series like \"The Morning Show\" and \"For All Mankind.\" Netflix also aired trailers for coming releases including \"The Crown,\" \"The Politician,\" and \"El Camino,\" the movie sequel to \"Breaking Bad.\"", "description": "HBO led the 2019 Emmy Awards in wins \u2014 and defeated Netflix \u2014 thanks to \"Game of Thrones,\" \"Chernobyl,\" \"Succession,\" and \"Last Week Tonight.\"", "authors": ["Ashley Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d88ba7e2e22af17a837cee4-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
