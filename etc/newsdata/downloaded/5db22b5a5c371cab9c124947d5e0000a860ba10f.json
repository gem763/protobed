Elizabeth Warren is the new front-runner? Just look at yesterday's debate.\n\nMuch like former Vice President Joe Biden was everyone\u2019s punching bag during the first few debates when he was the top dog, Warren was the object of the Democratic primary field\u2019s ire on Tuesday night, as she absorbed hit after hit from her opponents.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg jabbed her for being \u201cevasive\u201d on who would shoulder the cost of Medicare for All. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) tried to stump her on foreign policy. Former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) slammed her for trying too hard to soak the rich. Businessman Andrew Yang tried to debunk her tech policy plans.\n\nEveryone tried \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 to get her to say the word \u201ctaxes.\u201d\n\nWhile the attacks appeared to rattle the usually unflappable Warren, her team argued that the limelight only reinforced her status as the new candidate to beat.\n\n\u201cSince the beginning, I think she's kind of led the pace in terms of issues, right? She's come up with all these policy prescriptions,\u201d Rep. Lori Trahan (D-Mass.), a Warren surrogate, told VICE News in the spin room after the debate. \u201cThat was on stage tonight.\u201d\n\nStanding center stage, the Massachusetts Democrat lapped all the other candidates in speaking time during the first half of the debate \u2014 largely because everyone else kept attacking her and moderators needed to give her time to respond.\n\nBy the end of the debate, Warren had about twice as much speaking time as, if not more than, every candidate except Biden. She was the third-most searched for candidate online, according to Google trends.\n\nThat appearance of a lead tracks with polls, which have shown a steady rise for Warren nationwide and in some key early primary states, particularly Iowa, where she recently began outpolling Biden among likely caucus-goers.\n\n\n\nREAD: No More Mr. Nice Mayor Pete\n\nWarren was able to easily dodge some of the attacks.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, for instance, accused Warren of being \u201cpunitive\u201d for pitching an increased tax on the uber-wealthy, and \u201cpitting one part of the country against the other, instead of lifting people up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really shocked that anyone thinks I\u2019m punitive. I don\u2019t have a beef with billionaires,\u201d Warren responded. \u201cAll I'm saying is you make it to the top, the top one-tenth of one percent, then pitch in two cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it.\u201d\n\nStill, other attacks landed harder.\n\nWarren struggled as Buttigieg pointed out she\u2019d been asked \u201ca yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer,\u201d on whether her Medicare for All plan would increase middle-class taxes \u2014 even after the plan\u2019s author, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), has previously said it would.\n\n\u201cYour signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\n\u201cSo my view on this, and what I have committed to, is costs will go down for hardworking, middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it, that will leave behind millions of people who cannot,\u201d Warren replied.\n\n\"At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) fired back. \u201cAnd I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.\u201d\n\nREAD: Elizabeth Warren Won't Say the Word \u2018Taxes\u2019 When She Talks About Medicare for All\n\nKlobuchar took it to Warren later in the debate as well, accusing her of being dismissive of other Democrats who didn\u2019t see exactly eye-to-eye with her on policy and accusing detractors of employing Republican talking points.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire [Tom Steyer] wants to protect billionaires,\u201d Klobuchar said to laughs. \u201cWe just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea.\u201d\n\nTo that, Warren responded by reiterating the theme of her campaign.\n\n\u201cLook, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,\u201d she said.\n\nWarren also left an opening for candidates to expose her on foreign policy, a topic that has not been a strength of hers throughout her career, which has centered on domestic issues.\n\nGabbard name-checked Warren a few times during the debate, challenging her to articulate a foreign policy. At one point, Gabbard asked Warren to join her in calling for an end to regime-change wars.\n\n\u201cI think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way,\u201d Warren responded.\n\nThat opened up an opportunity for other campaigns to try to paint Warren as naive. The Biden campaign, in particular, pounced, and appears to hope Biden\u2019s reputation as a statesman and figure on the world stage can help him maintain a top position in the race.\n\n\u201cI thought it showed a striking degree of naivete and unpreparedness. I suspect she'll be walking that back pretty far. I mean she really means that, that we should have no troops anywhere in the Middle East?\u201d Biden surrogate Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) told reporters in the spin room after the debate. \u201cWe have a very significant troop presence across many countries, and that would be a dramatic change.\u201d\n\nWarren also tangled with former vp Biden at the end of the debate, implying but refusing to say outright that he hadn\u2019t done much to help her create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, after he claimed he was the only one onstage with any real policy accomplishments.\n\nThe tense exchange left both candidates seeming sour.\n\nBut other attacks against Warren fell flat \u2014 like Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 (D-Calif.) attempt to get Warren to agree with her that Twitter should ban President Trump.\n\n\u201cSo, look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter. I want to push him out of the White House,\u201d Warren said.\n\nCover: Former Vice President Joe Biden challenges Sen.
