Throughout the fight, it sustained nearly 11,000 casualties,\u201d he said.\n\nBy comparison, he noted, only six US troops and two American civilians were killed in that campaign.\n\n\u2013 Trump: US helped Kurds enough \u2013\n\nTrump has said he wants to end the US involvement in Syria and also explained that the US cannot do anything about a centuries-old hate between the Turks and Kurds.\n\nHe suggested that the United States has aided the Kurds enough.\n\n\u201cThey are fighting for their land,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t help us with the Second World War. They didn\u2019t help us with Normandy, as an example\u2026. We have spent tremendous amounts of money on helping the Kurds in terms of ammunition, in terms of weapons, in terms of money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all of that being said, we like the Kurds,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Upcoming disaster\u2019 \u2013\n\nMark Hertling, the former commanding general of the US Army\u2019s European operations, said Trump\u2019s decision \u201cpresages an upcoming disaster for the US.\u201d\n\n\u201cKurds of the SDF \u2014 our former reliable partners in the fight against ISIS \u2014 are being attacked by a NATO ally, Turkey. The repercussions for the US and NATO will be long-lasting and detrimental to security for Europe and the world,\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nThe SDF took the lead in the major campaigns to dislodge Islamic State fighters from key cities in brutal sieges that they led.\n\nPentagon officials said they were better trained and focused to do the job compared to Turkish and Iraqi troops and other possible proxies in the war.\n\n\u201cWhen the Iraq army collapsed, the Kurds were the ones who took the full brunt of ISIS\u2019 attack on civilization, not us, not the Turks,\u201d said Ruben Gallego, an Iraq war veteran and Democratic congressman.\n\n\u2013 Parallels in US past \u2013\n\nSome are drawing a parallel to previous episodes in US wars abroad when an ally was left to fend for itself, including the governments of Laos and South Vietnam in the 1970s.\n\nSome are worried as well that after fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan for 18 years, US negotiations with the Islamist insurgents could lead to a deal that leaves the government in Kabul vulnerable to them.\n\nRepublican Senator Martha McSally, a former Air Force pilot who deployed to the Middle East six times, said that Trump\u2019s decision to give way to Turkey \u201cis just wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe SDF, our Kurd allies, were the ones who paid a heavy price to fight that fight,\u201d she told Fox Radio.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the ones that defeated the caliphate.\u201d\n\nNot all in the US military community were opposed to Trump\u2019s move. Many support his desire to exit conflicts in the region after nearly two decades.\n\nDan Caldwell, a senior advisor at Concerned Veterans For America, said Trump was putting US interests first.\n\n\u201cIt is not in our national interest to be in the middle of a long-running conflict between Turkey and Syrian Kurds that predates the rise of ISIS and the Syrian Civil War,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nBut Gallego stressed that Washington cannot assume other allies will trust the United States in the future.\n\n\u201cOutside of Israel, the strongest ally, and most consistent ally that we have had in the Middle East have been the Kurdish people\u2026 and we have just lost that,\u201d said Gallego.\n\n\u201cAbandoning the Kurds is another stark reminder that \u2018America First\u2019 means \u2018America Alone,\u2019\u201d he tweeted.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 President Donald Trump has come under angry criticism from US military veterans for abandoning Kurdish battlefield allies after", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/0f7a63_smoke-rises-syrian-town-tal-abyad-turkish-bombings-wednesday-as-ankara-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
