Col. Ted Handler is not the kind of person to stand down in the face of a challenge.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nAfter serving as a Marine Corps Officer for more than 20 years, Handler chose to pursue a different kind of challenge -- the civilian workforce.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of job security [in the military],\u201d he told FOX Business. \u201cYou have been selected and selected and selected. You\u2019re with like-minded people, for the most part, that all have the same goal and are very team-oriented.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing into the civilian workforce is not anywhere near the same,\u201d Handler added. \u201cThey are a team and you\u2019re kind of a rookie again, where you may be in a leadership position, but you\u2019re definitely a rookie. There are different agendas at play. Different people have their own experiences and people come and go.\u201d\n\nLast March, Handler took the role of Senior Manager of Business Process Excellence at Stihl, Inc., the chainsaw and power equipment manufacturer.\n\n\u201cStihl has a great reputation,\u201d Handler said. \u201cThey have a great product, they have great benefits, great employees. It\u2019s a great team. But even in first place, people know that you can always do better. I like that challenge.\u201d\n\nHe also stays busy by sitting on the board of the Tidewater Community College Educational Foundation and co-running a hot sauce company with his wife, Stephanie.\n\nHandler first joined the Marines in 1996, when he was 27 years old. He served as an infantry officer until 1999, when he got married and decided to go into finance at investment bank PaineWebber, which was bought by UBS in 2000.\n\nHe signed up for the reserves in August 2001 -- just to \u201chave fun with the Marines being a leader\u201d -- one month before 9/11. He lost a couple of childhood friends in the attacks but was lucky that his father and brother-in-law survived -- his dad hadn\u2019t felt well, so stayed home that day, and his brother-in-law had missed his train.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cI felt very lucky, but also obligated and somewhat expected to go back to serve,\u201d Handler said.\n\nIn fact, his unit was one of the first to be recalled to active duty.\n\nEventually, Handler and his wife decided that he should continue to serve \u201cso that somebody else doesn\u2019t have to.\u201d But they agreed he would retire after 20 years.\n\nBy 2006, Handler was serving with the Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC). He was eventually stationed overseas as a Marine Special Operations Officer and was later recruited to work with the Naval Special Warfare Developmental Group -- the Navy portion of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) -- in Virginia Beach.\n\n\u201cIt was exceptionally exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of like one challenge after another after another.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Handler\u2019s wife reminded him of their 20-year agreement and told him she wanted to stay in Virginia Beach. So he agreed and retired.\n\nHaving been a part of the Special Operations community, he was able to participate in The Honor Foundation (THF), which helps prepare retired officers for success in the civilian workforce.\n\n\u201cThey give you the full opportunity to introspect and figure out what makes you tick and they do a whole thing about figuring out your why and what your strengths are and literally figuring out what it is that is going to be that next mission,\u201d Handler said.\n\nThat was vastly different from the typical military Transition Assistance Program, \u201cTAPS/TAMP,\u201d which Handler described as \u201chere\u2019s a whole bunch of information, here\u2019s a whole bunch of phone numbers and websites, good luck. Slap on the butt, on to the next one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was very disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the opportunity to go through The Honor Foundation was very unique.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cI realized that challenges and the stress is kind of what drives me,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd so I got introduced, through The Honor Foundation, to Stihl, Inc.\u201d\n\nHe found that his position at Stihl is similar to what he did with Special Operations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a team that works on looking at all of our business processes and how can we make them more efficient,\u201d Handler explained. \u201cAnd when you think about special operations ... that\u2019s essentially exactly what I\u2019m doing now, it\u2019s just a different mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat whole planning cycle the military uses is really the same thing that the business world is using,\u201d he added.\n\nAside from his work at Stihl, Handler and his wife also have a company, Sassy Hot Sauces, which plays off a military theme, with a drill instructor -- that\u2019s actually a hot pepper -- as the logo and different flavors named after different articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun and it\u2019s entrepreneurial and it\u2019s different,\u201d Handler said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where it takes us.\u201d", "description": "Ted Handler told FOX Business about the challenges of returning to the civilian workforce after 20 years in the Marine Corps.", "authors": ["Ann Schmidt"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Ted-headshot2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
