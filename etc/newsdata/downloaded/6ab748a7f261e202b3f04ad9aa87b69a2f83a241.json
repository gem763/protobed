REUTERS/Carlos Jasso\n\nVenezuela\u2019s economic crisis under the leftist Maduro has sent several million people fleeing abroad in recent years, with more than 850,000 ending up in Peru.\n\nThe initially welcoming attitude to Venezuelans around South America has soured amid accusations they bring crime, crowd the job market, and strain social services.\n\nThe mood appears to be particularly ugly in Peru, where videos circulating on social media in recent days appear to show a young Venezuelan woman being beaten in the street at night, a street-seller complaining of harassment by police, and pamphlets demanding the migrants\u2019 exit.\n\n\u201cThese are shameful and inhuman acts, permitted or committed by Peruvian government authorities and encouraged by hate campaigns against Venezuelans,\u201d Maduro\u2019s government said in a statement issued by Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza.\n\n\u201cVenezuela denounces the Peruvian government for violating and neglecting its international responsibilities by promoting and allowing acts of segregation and xenophobia,\u201d it added, saying various \u201cracist\u201d governments in the region were working with Venezuela\u2019s opposition.\n\nAlong with dozens of other nations around the world, Peru has recognized Venezuelan congress head and opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president and denounced Maduro as a usurper after an election last year critics say was rigged.\n\n\u201cPeru strongly rejects the unfounded accusations of xenophobia made by the illegitimate and dictatorial regime of Nicolas Maduro,\u201d its Foreign Ministry said in a statement responding to the salvo from Caracas.\n\nPeru accused Maduro of driving Venezuelans out of their homeland due to rights abuses, and said it had shown solidarity in welcoming so many people fleeing \u201cinhuman conditions.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Guaido told reporters during a visit to a poor Caracas suburb that it was important not to over-generalize about xenophobia by Peruvians or crime by Venezuelans.\n\n\u201cWe know that Peru has supported Venezuela\u2019s struggle, but also we should take urgent, corrective measures to avoid attacks on Venezuelan citizens,\u201d he added in a tweet on Sunday.", "description": "Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government accused Peruvian authorities on Sunday of fomenting \"xenophobia\" against the large Venezuelan exile population after a series of incidents of apparent mistreatment of migrants.", "authors": ["Vivian Sequera", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435371427&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T04Q", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
