The Wall Street Journal first reported their arrests, which the FBI confirmed to The Daily Beast on Wednesday morning.\n\nParnas and Fruman are charged with making illegal straw donations, including a $325,000 contribution to the group America First Action. As The Daily Beast first reported, that donation actually came from an entirely different, undisclosed company owned by Parnas. It is illegal to donate to federal political candidates in the name of another person or entity.\n\nProsecutors allege a host of other, smaller straw donations designed, they say, to both evade federal campaign contribution limits and conceal the actual sources of the funds. Parnas is currently facing a civil lawsuit attempting to collect more than $500,000 that he owes a jilted business partner from a years-old movie deal gone bad.\n\nIn addition to the straw donations, prosecutors say that Parnas, Fruman, and their co-conspirators made donations using money provided by an unnamed foreign national, who was ineligible to contribute to federal political campaigns under U.S. law.\n\nParnas and Fruman are central to an ongoing impeachment inquiry against Trump. The two men assisted Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, in his efforts to dig up dirt on Trump\u2019s political opponents in Ukraine. Among the objectives they sought was the removal of the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, whom Giuliani believed was standing in the way of investigations he and Trump wanted to see launched into Joe and Hunter Biden\u2019s work in the country.\n\nThe campaign finance allegations against them are inextricably linked with that effort. Prosecutors say their extensive political contributions, beginning in early 2018, were designed to curry favor with American policymakers in an effort to advance Parnas\u2019 and Fruman\u2019s political and business endeavors.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t comment at this point,\u201d Giuliani told The Daily Beast. Parnas and Fruman are expected to appear in court on Thursday, the Journal reported.\n\nThe charges on Wednesday are likely to have reverberations well beyond the president\u2019s inner circle. America First Action has been a major player in congressional elections as well. And the indictment issued on Wednesday makes reference to one of those contests. The PAC spent more than $3 million to help elected former Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) after he wrote a letter calling for the ambassador\u2019s firing. Sessions lost his 2018 election but is running for a new seat in Congress this cycle.\n\nAmerica First told The Daily Beast this week that the money donated by Global Energy Producers was sequestered by the super PAC pending resolution of the legal issues surrounding it.\n\n-- with reporting by Pervaiz Shallwani", "description": "Businessmen Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman will reportedly appear in federal court in Virginia on Thursday.", "authors": ["Lachlan Markay"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_674,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570715066/RTX75F7R_exod1r", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
