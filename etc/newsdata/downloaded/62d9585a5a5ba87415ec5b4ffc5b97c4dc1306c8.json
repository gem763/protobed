They came to life and went the extra mile.'\n\nMotsi also chose to save Emma and Alja\u017e, explaining: 'Particularly in the dance off, Emma and Alja\u017e were the couple that looked more rehearsed and on top of it.'\n\nDance-off: Both couples performed their routines again, with Emma and Alja\u017e performing their Jive to Kids in America by Kim Wilde\n\nFollowing suit, and putting the final nail in the coffin for Dev, Bruno chose to save Emma and Alja\u017e, adding: 'Emma and Alja\u017e were the couple that showed no mistakes.
