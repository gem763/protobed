If a party secures a majority by winning at least 170 ridings, it can form its own government.\n\nAs of Monday evening, it was not immediately known if the Liberal party secured a majority government.\n\nTrudeau, the 47-year-old son of longtime Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, won in a landslide in 2015, bringing his progressive values and star power to the office. Throughout his first term, he\u2019s been a fierce champion of diversity, immigration rights, and the legalization of recreational marijuana. Under his leadership, Canada saw its lowest unemployment rate in decades and became part of global conversations about climate change.\n\nA year ago, Trudeau\u2019s re-election may have seemed like a done deal, but his reputation suffered after a series of scandals, with some of his rivals labeling him \u201ca fraud.\u201d\n\nLast month, Time magazine published a 2001 photograph in which Trudeau\u2019s face is covered in dark makeup for an Arabian Nights-themed gala at a private school where he taught two decades ago. Within hours, two more photos surfaced of the Canadian leader wearing blackface: one of Trudeau singing the Jamaican folk song \u201cDay-O\u201d and another of him sticking his tongue out while using dark makeup.\n\nWhile the prime minister has repeatedly apologized for the offensive incidents, he admitted he did not know how many times he has used skin-darkening makeup in the past.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t even remember how many times he put blackface on, because the fact of the matter is he\u2019s always wearing a mask,\u201d Scheer, 40, said in the last two-hour debate on Oct. 7. \u201cMr. Trudeau, you are a phony and you are a fraud, and you do not deserve to govern this country.\u201d\n\nThe blackface scandal came after Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog concluded that Trudeau violated the nation\u2019s ethics regulations when he allegedly pressured his then-justice minister to cut an out-of-court settlement with engineering and construction company SNC-Lavalin. His alleged efforts to protect SNC-Lavalin from criminal prosecution after it was accused of having dealt for a a decade with the Gadhafi regime in Libya prompted multiple resignations within Trudeau\u2019s cabinet and inner circle.\n\n\u201cWhen did you decide that the rules don\u2019t apply to you?\u201d Scheer asked Trudeau during an Oct. 7 debate.\n\n\u201cThe role of a prime minister is to stand up for Canadians\u2019 jobs, to stand up for the public interest, and that is what I\u2019ve done and that is what I will continue to do,\u201d Trudeau replied.\n\nTrudeau addressed the scandals in several final campaign stops, pleading voters to look past his missteps and allow him to build on his first-term achievements.\n\nHe also warned voters about Scheer\u2019s proposed rollback of environmental protections, including his pledge to \u201cuse every legislative tool\u201d to repeal the Liberal Party\u2019s federal carbon tax. Trudeau has committed Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\n\u201cWe need a strong, progressive government that will unite Canadians and fight climate change\u2014not a progressive opposition,\u201d Trudeau told voters at a Vancouver rally on Sunday. \u201cWe need to unite as citizens. We need to unite as a planet.\u201d\n\nAs the embattled Canadian leader\u2019s approval numbers sank to a near-record low last week, former U.S. President Barack Obama endorsed him in a well-timed tweet, calling Trudeau the progressive leader the world needs.\n\n\u201cI was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He\u2019s a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change,\u201d Obama tweeted. \u201cThe world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.\u201d\n\nScheer, a 40-year-old father of five, has faced his own hurdles since becoming a party leader in 2017. Throughout the campaign, experts say, he has struggled to define himself against the other six party leaders. Voters outside his base and party opponents have also slammed Scheer for his anti-abortion views, his refusal to address his beliefs about same-sex marriage, and his views on climate change.\n\nLast month, The Globe and Mail also revealed the Conservative leader misrepresented his previous work experience in the insurance industry on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and revealed that he has dual U.S.-Canadian citizenship. In response, Scheer told voters he sought in August to renounce his U.S. citizenship.\n\nOn the campaign trail Sunday, Sheer said Canada \u201ccannot afford\u201d a Liberal government propped up by the third-place New Democratic Party\u2014focusing on the economic ramifications of re-electing Trudeau.\n\n\u201cWe can only imagine what the NDP\u2019s price would be to keep Justin Trudeau in power,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever it is, we know Trudeau would pay any price to stay in power and he\u2019d use your money to do it.\u201d", "description": "Monday\u2019s election capped off an acrimonious campaign, with Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals locked in a dead heat with Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservatives.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2021,w_3594,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571712910/RTS2R60N_smubgr", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
