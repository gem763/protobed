REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File Photo\n\nLondon City is the capital\u2019s fifth-biggest - and most central - airport, popular with business travelers, bankers and politicians for short-haul and regional routes.\n\nOn Thursday, 18,000 passengers are due to arrive or depart from the airport, with 286 flights scheduled.\n\nExtinction Rebellion, which has targeted government buildings over the last few days, said protesters would lie, sit or glue themselves to \u201cnonviolently use their bodies to close the airport.\u201d\n\nThey said they were protesting plans to expand the airport, which aims to have 6.5 million passengers a year by 2022, compared to the 4.8 million in 2018, and which has said there could be demand for as many as 11 million a year by 2035.\n\n\u201cAir travel is an icon of our fragile \u2018just-in-time\u2019 economic system. That system will break, as Climate Chaos hits,\u201d group spokesman Rupert Read said in a statement.\n\n\u201cBy non-violently shutting down this airport... we are demonstrating the utter frailty of the transport systems that countries such as ours, unwisely, have come to depend upon.\u201d\n\nLondon police have made hundreds of arrests as the protesters, labeled \u201cunco-operative crusties\u201d by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, began two weeks of civil disobedience.\n\nLondon City Airport said it was working with police to prepare for the protests.\n\n\u201cOur shared priority is the safe operation of the airport and to minimize disruption for passengers using the airport over the coming days,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nAll passengers traveling for the rest of this week will have to show their boarding passes to access the terminal.\n\nExtinction Rebellion said that if protesters do not make it into the airport itself, they will occupy the neighboring Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station and access road to blockade it from the outside.\n\nThe airport said it is \u201ccommitted to building a more sustainable future for the airport and the aviation industry\u201d and has said that it will achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.", "description": "London City Airport was braced for disruption on Thursday after climate-change protesters Extinction Rebellion vowed to occupy its terminal and shut down operations for three days as part of its action in the British capital.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1439028352&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9825X", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
