That is happening again these two weeks as a 16-year-old girl from Sweden, Greta Thunberg, is stepping onto center stage to mobilize the world against climate change.\n\nDavid Gergen\n\nJames Piltch\n\nThose of us who are older are well reminded of how the young of this country rose up some 50 years ago in the Civil Rights era. In May of 1963, more than one thousand young people in Birmingham, Alabama, marched through the city to call attention to racial injustice. When many of the children marched again the next day, the notoriously racist sheriff Bull Connor set vicious police dogs on them. The children were under attack -- by the dogs, clubs, fire hoses, and whatever means deemed necessary by the police. The television pictures that night sickened the nation.\n\nThe violence continued until the Department of Justice stepped in and the marches came to an end. But even as the marches stopped, the impact of the Birmingham Children's Crusade continued to be felt. The crusade offered moral clarity to the nation and proved pivotal in swaying President John F. Kennedy and Americans everywhere to urgently confront the need for racial justice.\n\nWe are at yet another moment in which the voice and efforts of the young are needed. The Baby Boomers and Gen Xers in power have proven unable to take action on a multitude of issues recently. But nowhere is their inaction more glaring than on the issues that threaten the safety of people everywhere and especially millennials and members of Generation Z: first guns and now climate change.\n\nJUST WATCHED Greta Thunberg sails across Atlantic in zero-emissions yacht Replay More Videos ...

A year ago, after another mass shooting at a high school, this one in Florida, politicians and the NRA performed yet another tap dance, counting on the horror to be soon forgotten. But the surviving students would not allow such avoidance to take place again.\n\nRead More", "description": "At certain points in history, when institutions and established leaders have failed to step up and take action, it falls to the youngest among us to take charge.
