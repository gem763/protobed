The president was not involved with any of this.\u201d\n\nClaiming that Giuliani had originally gotten a tip from a \u201cformer federal investigator\u201d that people in Ukraine tried to frame Trump on Russia collusion\u2014likely referencing the Democratic National Committee server/Ukraine conspiracy theory\u2014diGenova went on to say this is how Giuliani came across supposedly incriminating information on Hunter and Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cHe asked us\u2014[Rudy] asked us to represent any of the Ukrainian whistleblowers who wanted to provide information to U.S. law enforcement about what they had heard and learned,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cThey were fearful to come to U.S. law enforcement because the United States ambassador in the Ukraine at that time had threatened these individuals not to give information because, as she, the ambassador, put it, Trump was going to be impeached and Biden was going to be president.\u201d\n\nThe Trump-supporting lawyer then claimed the \u201ctrip to Ukraine was canceled,\u201d adding that nobody from his firm ever went there or represented any so-called whistleblowers. He also noted that \u201cany conversations we may have had with anybody prior to that time obviously are privileged.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were never representing the president of the United States,\u201d he insisted. \u201cMr. Giuliani was. So, that\u2019s the story.\u201d\n\nWhen further pressed by host Bryan Nehman on Fox\u2019s reporting, diGenova reiterated that he never traveled to Ukraine or spoke to any Ukrainian \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d claiming the network had been told that. He concluded by saying Trump has never paid him or his law firm and that the only conversations he\u2019s had with Giuliani were over potentially representing whistleblowers.\n\nOn Monday morning, Giuliani told The Daily Beast that \u201cJoe is absolutely right,\u201d and that President Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t know about this at this point. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d even briefed him yet [on this specific matter]\u2026 They weren\u2019t working on the investigation with me. I did the investigation with my people. This was not a matter that was brought to the president\u201d while the trip was being planned.\n\nGiuliani said that he had planned to bring \u201cVicki\u201d Toensing with him on the aborted Ukraine trip earlier this year, to offer her services to Ukrainian individuals as independent counsel. When asked if he had told the president about any of this after the trip fell apart, Trump\u2019s personal attorney said \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you what I told the president\u201d and cited privilege.\n\nGiuliani also mentioned that after the Fox News Sunday story aired, he sent Wallace \u201ca long text\u201d informing the host how \u201cdisappointed\u201d he was by him \u201cbuying the Biden\u201d line.\n\nWallace, through a Fox News spokesperson, confirmed to The Daily Beast that \"we stand by our story.\"\n\nThe diGenova-Toensing wrinkle in this latest scandal\u2014a mess that stemmed from a whistleblower complaint and has since ballooned into the biggest impeachment push of this presidency\u2014is yet another example of influential and well-known figures in Trumpworld and the administration getting sucked into the fray.\n\nLate last week, days before the Fox News Sunday host broke the news, The Daily Beast had called diGenova, simply to ask him\u2014still an informal legal adviser to Trump and one of the president\u2019s most reliable cable-news defenders\u2014for his general thoughts on the latest Trump-Ukraine-Giuliani-Biden news.\n\nAs soon as The Daily Beast said the word \u201cUkraine,\u201d the often media-friendly, pro-Trump attorney quickly said, \u201cl am not commenting on anything\u201d related to the Ukraine matter. When asked why, he repeated the same sentence before hanging up. (The Daily Beast later learned that news outlets had at that time already started looking into the diGenova-Toensing lead and asking around about it.)", "description": "The Trump-boosting lawyers didn\u2019t deny they were involved in a controversial, aborted Ukraine trip.
