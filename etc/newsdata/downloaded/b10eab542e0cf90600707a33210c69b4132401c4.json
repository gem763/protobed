Reuters TV via REUTERS\n\nSince claiming the title in her U.S. Open main draw debut, Andreescu has had a trophy photoshoot atop Rockefeller Centre and appeared on several U.S. morning shows in New York to discuss her breakthrough win.\n\n\u201cI never thought it would be this hectic, but I\u2019m not complaining,\u201d Andreescu, 19, said on Good Morning America. \u201cThis is truly an amazing accomplishment, but I could definitely get used to this feeling. I\u2019m not done yet.\u201d\n\nAndreescu produced a bold and brilliant performance on Saturday to secure a 6-3 7-5 win and deny former world number one Williams from a record-tying 24th Grand Slam title.\n\nWith the win, Andreescu has jumped to a career-high fifth in the world rankings a year after sitting outside the top 200 when she was an unknown quantity to most in her home country.\n\nBut Andreescu will now have to get used to her celebrity status as she is headline news back home.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t really sunk in,\u201d Andreescu said on Live with Kelly & Ryan. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have the time to just see what\u2019s happening in my life right now. It\u2019s been a crazy year for me, and being able to hold this trophy is pretty awesome.\u201d\n\nAndreescu, who also appeared on the \u201cToday\u201d show, ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d and \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d with Jimmy Fallon to discuss her U.S. Open win, said she has spent plenty of time reflecting on her journey to the U.S. Open title.\n\n\u201cI started playing tennis at the age of seven, and ever since then I\u2019ve been dreaming of this moment,\u201d Andreescu told Good Morning America.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s another story for it to actually happen. So I\u2019m just, like, truly blessed right now.\u201d", "description": "Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu, who upstaged tennis great Serena Williams in the U.S. Open final to win her maiden Grand Slam title, said she was not done yet during a whirlwind media tour on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428101351&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881WO", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
