'Probably not.'\n\nThe lease for the Speedway does not run out until June 2026, but Mr Aunger said they had no idea when they would have to close.\n\nThe new metro line is due to begin operation in 2030.\n\n'I can't imagine they're going to stall for that long so we can finish up our lease,' he said.\n\nSydney Metro does not need the site for construction until 2021, and the NSW government has said it intends to 'ensure the sport continues throughout the transition' through the construction of a new speedway - though a new site has not been earmarked.\n\nThe iconic Sydney Speedway (pictured) will be forced to close to make way for the Metro West project, which will connect Parramatta to the CBD\n\nThe racetrack has been open in its current form since 1977, and has been a special place for generations of motorsport fans\n\nThe track's (pictured in its early days) closure has devastated the local community, and racing fans around the world\n\nFelicity Waldron, the Speedway's business director, said nobody at the track had heard a thing about the planned closure until Monday, despite spending the last two years working to renew their Crown land lease.\n\nShe said everyone was in 'total shock' when they received a call about 11am Monday notifying them of the forced closure.\n\nWHAT IS THE METRO WEST PROJECT? The Metro West project will connect Parramatta to the Sydney CBD in just 20 minutes. The project will have eight stops along 24km of rail line: Westmead, Parramatta, Sydney Olympic Park, North Strathfield, Burwood North, Five Dock, The Bays Precinct and the Sydney CBD. To make way for the new track, 92 businesses and 23 homes will be compulsorily acquired by the NSW Government. It is expected to be completed in 2030.\n\nMs Waldron and her husband Barry have invested millions into the racetrack, hoping to secure a long-term lease and 'take the sport into a new era'.\n\n'This is devastating. Absolutely devastating,' Mr Waldron said.\n\n'I can't believe that in all our dealings with the Government through Crown Lands in our proposed long- term planning discussions, nobody thought to give us even a hint that this could happen.\n\n'How is it possible something as enormous as that could be overlooked?'\n\nAs the news broke on Monday, hundreds of motorsport fans took to social media to share stories of their time around the track.\n\n'My friend\u2019s ashes are buried on the start/finish line,' one devastated race fan wrote.\n\n'Heartbreaking to think the sport that was in his blood and is his resting place is to be taken [away].'\n\nMany parents took to social media to mourn the loss of the track, noting it had played a significant role in their family bonding\n\nThe Valvoline Raceway was built in 1977, and has become a home away from home for generations of Australian families\n\nOne woman said she met her husband at the track, while a father noted the track was the special place he shared with his young son.\n\n'[It's] absolutely disgusting what this government is doing to this country,' one man wrote.\n\n'I\u2019ve been going to PCR /VR since the early 90\u2019s with my mum and brothers and still continue to go now with my wife and son.\n\n'I can\u2019t believe they're doing this, I hope this place can be saved somehow.'\n\nAnother told the story of how his pregnant mother was hit in the stomach by a tyre from a crash on the speedway, joking it had 'knocked the love of the sport into him'.\n\nOne Nation Senator Mark Latham said the closure was a 'slap in the face' to fans, and that an alternative location needed to have been organised before the closure was decided.\n\n'It's disrespectful to supporters of the motorsport,' he said.\n\n'Where do they go now? The government needs to answer that question, and also have alternative places for the train yard - it's not easy to relocate [the speedway], because of the noise issue.'\n\nThe Valvoline Raceway will become the site of a protest rally on Tuesday as workers and locals band together to fight against the closure\n\nRacing has taken place at the venue since the 1930s (pictured is famous racing car driver Jack Brabham at the Speedway in 1954)\n\nThe NSW Government announced on Tuesday it would hold a forum on November 15 to discuss other potential locations for the track, and said there was ample space for it to be rebuilt elsewhere.\n\nMr Latham said the speedway was an 'institution' in Western Sydney, and the crowds it drew were a great support to local businesses.\n\n'It's almost like they think the speedway is dispensable,' he said. 'You can't do that to people.'\n\nMr Aunger said as part of their lease renewal, the Speedway had looked into the economic benefits of its continued position in Parramatta, and found the track brought in $246million annually to the local area.\n\nCouncillor Joseph Rahme said the decision made it 'obvious' that 'to many, [the speedway] was insignificant'.\n\n'But to the people of the area it was a special piece of Granville,' he said.\n\n'The buzz of the cars signified summer was upon us, it was a small slice of Daytona in our backyard, to many children it was the start of their love of fast racing cars.\n\n'I will miss that distinctive sound which is forever etched in my mind and heart and synonymous with my childhood. I will be taking my children for one last lap.'\n\nMr Rahme said it was a shame the local council had not been consulted, as they would have been happy to help find alternate locations for the marshalling yard.\n\n'It is hard to imagine a Saturday summer night without the rumble of the race cars or the voice of the announcer reverberating through the air,' he said.\n\n'It is sad that these venues which bring so much pleasure to adults and children alike are being pushed aside in the name of progress,' he said.\n\nAs locals shared their memories, one fan revealed their friend's ashes had been scattered at the start/finish line, such was their dedication to the track\n\nOthers spoke of meeting their partners at the track, while one man said his mother had been hit in the stomach while pregnant with him by a tyre that flew off one of the racers after a crash 'knocking the love of motorsport into him'\n\nFans of the Speedway will flock to the track on Tuesday night to protest the injustice, with fanatics told to 'bring your cars, bring your shirts, bring your families'.\n\n'We've got a big rally here on Tuesday,' Mr Aunger said.\n\n'We're not expecting old love in the Premier's chair to suddenly change her mind, but [we want] to show this affects us, we have solidarity and we have an economic viability.'\n\nTuesday's protest is set to be an emotional event, with many calling the proposed closure 'devastating' and questioning why the nearby Rosehill Racecourse couldn't be demolished instead.\n\n'I'll chain myself to the gates, they can get f**ked,' one distressed fan wrote on social media.\n\n'They can\u2019t do this, it's wrong and devastating - not only to the owners but to the biggest family ever - the speedway family,' another added.\n\nPoliticians and locals believe they and their families are being shafted in the name of progress", "description": "Furious workers at the Sydney Speedway have slammed the NSW government over its handling of the track's closure to make way for the Metro West line.", "authors": ["Hannah Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/04/20018614-0-image-a-13_1571716497931.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
