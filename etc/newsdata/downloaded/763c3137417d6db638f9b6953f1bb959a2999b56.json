UPDATE 1-European shares hold monthly highs on German data, stimulus hopes\n\n* STOXX 600 inches lower after opening up\n\n* German exports up 0.7% in July\n\n* Airline, commodities stocks weigh on market\n\n(Adds comments, updates prices)\n\nBy Sagarika Jaisinghani and Susan Mathew\n\nSept 9 (Reuters) - European stock markets hovered at\n\none-month highs on Monday after data showed a surprise rise in\n\nGerman exports and on firmer expectations of a new wave of\n\nstimulus by the European Central Bank later this week.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index opened higher but\n\nwas down 0.1% as losses in the airlines and commodities sectors\n\noutweighed gains in oil and auto stocks. O/R\n\nGerman exports rose 0.7% in July versus expectations of a\n\ndrop of 0.5%, indicating resilience in the face of impact from\n\ntariff disputes and Brexit uncertainties. The latest data follow a streak of underwhelming ones that\n\nhas fuelled concerns that Europe's biggest economy could tip\n\ninto recession in the July-September quarter.\n\n\"Germany is the powerhouse of Europe. If (its) economy has\n\nthe potential for recession, then that's a real game changer for\n\nECB policy,\" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.\n\nWith euro zone inflation well below target, market\n\nparticipants are betting that the ECB will cut its rate on bank\n\novernight deposits, its primary interest rate tool, for the\n\nfirst time since 2016 when it meets on Thursday. A slew of upbeat geopolitical news propelled stock markets\n\nto one-month highs last week and signs of resumption in the\n\nU.S.-China trade talks further brightened sentiment.\n\nHowever, mixed economic data from around the world has\n\nincreased hopes of more stimulus by central banks to head off a\n\nglobal recession.\n\nMarkets were lifted on Friday after China said it would\n\nslash the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, while\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central\n\nbank would continue to \"act as appropriate\" to sustain economic\n\nexpansion. Air France slid to the bottom of the index after\n\ndisappointing August numbers, while IAG fell 2.5% as\n\nBritish Airways pilots began a 48-hour strike. Together, the\n\nstocks put the travel and leisure sector on track for\n\nits worst day in nearly a month.\n\nCommodity-lined stocks were the among biggest drag\n\non the market, weighed down by a decline in base metal and iron\n\nore prices. MET/L IRONORE/\n\nGermany's trade-sensitive DAX index was trading\n\nflat. Broadcaster ProSiebenSat 1 Media topped the\n\nSTOXX 600 after brokerage UBS upgraded the stock to \"buy\" from\n\n\"neutral\".", "description": "UPDATE 1-European shares hold monthly highs on German data, stimulus hopes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/389da45fab1145bdde37c1802bd5980b_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
