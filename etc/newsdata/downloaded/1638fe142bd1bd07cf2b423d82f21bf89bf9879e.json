Premiere Rush CC is available today on desktop and iOS, with Android support coming later in 2019. Adobe says the app is \u201cdesigned specifically for online video creators\u201d, and exporting options optimized for every social platform including Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Vimeo.\n\nPremiere Rush CC, or Project Rush as it was called when it was first revealed at VidCon this year, is Adobe\u2019s solution for budding YouTubers and influencers looking for an all-in-one video editing program. It\u2019s built to simplify the video-editing, motion graphics, and audio mixing capabilities of Adobe\u2019s professional software like Premiere Pro, AfterEffects, and Audition. For example, users can bypass having to create their own animated title card for their videos by just grabbing some motion graphics templates from Adobe Stock.\n\nRush also offers a neat one-click auto-duck audio mixing feature that automatically adjusts the volume of the background music during voice-overs. It\u2019s powered by Adobe Sensei, an artificial intelligence framework that\u2019s built into the Creative Cloud platform. Premiere Rush files are also compatible with Premiere Pro, if you need to pick up where you left off and finish your project on a more powerful video-editing tool.\n\nAs for pricing, the app is included across a series of Creative Cloud plans and starts at a $9.99/month plan for individuals. There\u2019s also a Starter Plan, which lets users create an unlimited number of projects on desktop and iOS, and export three of them for free.\n\nAdobe also showed previews of its upcoming apps at the kickoff of its annual Max conference today, including an early version of its Photoshop app for the iPad, as well as a new illustration app called Project Gemini. The iOS Photoshop app, arriving sometime in 2019, will be able to combine raster, vector and new dynamic brushes and will be compatible with Photoshop CC.", "description": "Adobe\u2019s latest video editing app is Premiere Rush CC, a tool made specifically for YouTube and Instagram.
