In some ways I'm getting punished for winning because I can't do the punditry.'\n\nMark Selby avoided joining the list of big-name casualties on Thursday as he booked his place in the quarter-finals and a showdown against O'Sullivan's conqueror Mei with a comfortable 4-1 victory over Xiao Guodong.\n\nMark Allen produced a dominant performance, beating Barry Hawkins 4-0 in under an hour with breaks of 60, 89, 100 and 129. Hawkins also lost his high break prize to Ford.", "description": "Ronnie O'Sullivan exited the English Open hours after his latest bizarre claim over the K2 Leisure Centre in Crawley.
