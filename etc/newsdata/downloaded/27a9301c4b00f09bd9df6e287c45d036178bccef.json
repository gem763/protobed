Opening on Thursday 5 September, Being Human is a new permanent exhibit that explores trust, hope and fear, identity and health in the 21st century through four sections: genetics, minds and bodies, infection and environmental breakdown.\n\nThe space, which for 12 years housed Medicine Now, has been redesigned with reclaimed wood panelling and warm colours by the Turner prize-winning arts and architecture collective Assemble. The exhibition \u201cexplores our relationship with ourselves, with each other and with the world around us\u201d, Barlow says. Each of the four sections asks a different question. \u201cWith minds and bodies the question is, why do we sometimes act like we value some lives more than others? With environmental breakdown, we ask why it\u2019s so hard for us to act on climate change, when its effects are already here. And with that, the question of how we\u2019re reacting to what\u2019s being lost and how we see ourselves living in the future.\u201d\n\nBeing Human displays imposing works of art alongside other artefacts, which include seeds withdrawn from the Svalbard global seed vault, a storage facility created by the Norwegian government in 2008 to protect vital crops such as wheat against global disasters, war or disease, and a commercially available gene-editing kit, items intended to ground the conceptual nature of the artworks in a scientific context. These are contrasted with pieces by established artists such as Deborah Kelly\u2019s No Human Being Is Illegal (in All Our Glory), Kia LaBeija\u2019s Eleven, a self-portrait of the black artist, who is living with HIV, and Superflex\u2019s short film Flooded McDonald\u2019s, which questions with whom responsibility for environmental breakdown lies: the customer or the corporation?\n\nVisitors move from the genetics section, a \u201cdistillation of what makes us us\u201d to an exploration of our relationships with our bodies and minds, then to our relationship with others and, finally, to our relationship with the planet and our grief for what has already been lost. They will be \u201cprogressing from things that feel deeply personal, and really allow them to scrutinise questions of identity, to reflecting on the global impact of environmental breakdown\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An image from Superflex\u2019s short film Flooded McDonald\u2019s.\n\nAt the centre of the exhibit is Refugee Astronaut, by British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare. The traveller, wearing a spacesuit of Dutch wax fabric and moon boots, carries a net of possessions on his back containing a telescope, an old camera and a star map, as well as evocatively titled books The Last Migration and The Quest for the Perfect Place. Barlow says these items are jumping-off points from which visitors can create their own idea of where the astronaut is heading.\n\nIs the astronaut a refugee from Earth or is the artwork grounded in the current refugee crisis? \u201cIt can be read both ways,\u201d says Barlow. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong antithesis going on. Astronauts are cosmic explorers and then the word \u2018refugee\u2019 ties it to a very specific context. It pulls together so many different ideas, opening up questions around colonialism and the environment.\u201d\n\nShonibare\u2019s commission is the third in the Refugee Astronaut series, which began as criticism of colonialism and exploitation and its historical annexation, explains the artist. Each sculpture\u2019s spacesuit has a different pattern, the latest of which is of green lines and clouds \u201cto signify an ebbing relationship with nature, due to climate change\u201d.\n\nIt is with good reason that this work serves as the exhibition\u2019s keystone. \u201cRefugee Astronaut is a metaphor for a post-apocalyptic figure, with his worldly possessions on his back, seeking conflict-free and environmentally clean, greener pastures,\u201d says Shonibare. The work can be read either as \u201cdystopian, or a note of caution\u201d against \u201ccatastrophic climate events that will increasingly lead to migration and a scramble for scarce resources, leading to global conflict\u201d.\n\nThe astronaut can be glimpsed from any point in the gallery, a constant reminder of the end point, the \u201cultimate progression\u201d. \u201cMaybe in this future, leaving Earth will be the only answer,\u201d Barlow muses. \u201cIt\u2019s a question mark on the end of the collection\u2019s progression.\u201d\n\nBeing Human opens on 5 September at the Wellcome Collection, London NW1.", "description": "An unusual astronaut is at the centre of a new exhibition of art and scientific artefacts", "authors": ["Laura Potier"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7d3983b83f8c347470457bd319e492499b69718/0_0_6522_3913/master/6522.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bfbead548400323f672a2c8a55e55992"}
