But the 56-year-old former transport minister will struggle to negotiate majorities for any legal initiative because of a fragmented opposition.\n\nAnalysts said he could gain enough backing to partially reverse a judicial overhaul that has been described by European Union and U.S. officials as a threat to the rule of law.\n\nBut they added he may find support wanes quickly, especially if the economy stalls and forces it to cut spending.\n\n\u201cThe other parties will try a permanent blackmail, vote by vote, measure by measure,\u201d Sergiu Miscoiu, a political science professor at Babes-Bolyai University, said.\n\nOrban said his government\u2019s chief objectives include downsizing government structures, investment in key infrastructure projects and correcting economic measures which have hit the business sector.\n\nHe also said focus will be given to \u201censure real independence of the justice system\u201d.\n\nThe EU and U.S. have also criticised the previous government for watering down anti-graft legislation.\n\nExpansionary fiscal and wage policies have increased Romania\u2019s budget and current account deficits, while tax hikes and energy price caps approved without public debate and impact assessment have dented investors\u2019 appetite.\n\nThe leu currency was steady against the euro on Tuesday, but it has fallen 2.1% so far this year - central and eastern Europe\u2019s second worst-performer - as widening deficits and delayed policymaking take their toll.\n\nA long election cycle also weighs on financial assets, with the European Union state holding a presidential vote in November, as well as local and parliamentary elections likely in mid- and late-2020.\n\nDancila, who remains interim premier until parliament endorses a new cabinet, is the third Social Democrat Party (PSD) prime minister in as many years.\n\n\u201cPSD has effectively inhibited Romania\u2019s development and held us all in place,\u201d Iohannis said.\n\n\u201cI hope all parliamentary parties understand we have a political crisis and it is necessary that this new government be in place as soon as possible.\u201d", "description": "Romania's centrist President Klaus Iohannis said on Tuesday he had appointed opposition Liberal Party leader Ludovic Orban as prime minister-designate to form a transitional government until a parliamentary election next year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441133668&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E192", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
