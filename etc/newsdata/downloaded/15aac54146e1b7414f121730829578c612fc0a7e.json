They ignore the reality that Turkey is vital to NATO \u2014 and far more important to U.S. national security than the Kurds.\n\nPolitical scientist Samuel Huntington warned in \u201cThe Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order\u201d (1996) that Turkey eventually would turn Islamist and leave NATO. Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is an Islamist strongman who has been pulling away from NATO and leaning toward Russia.\n\nTurkey\u2019s departure from NATO may be historically inevitable \u2014 but it is irresponsible for Washington elites to accelerate a process that could begin the unraveling of NATO. Turkey, after all, is not the only discontented NATO member.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPresident Trump Donald John TrumpGraham to introduce resolution condemning House impeachment inquiry Support for impeachment inches up in poll Fox News's Bret Baier calls Trump's attacks on media 'a problem' MORE is right to try to accommodate Turkey\u2019s legitimate security interests on the Syrian border, while protecting the Kurds, in order to keep Turkey in NATO.\n\nAfter the United States, Turkey has the second-largest standing armed forces in NATO, with more soldiers (639,000 military, paramilitary and civilian personnel), tanks (3,200), armored fighting vehicles (9,500), artillery (2,400) and military aircraft (1,067 fighter jets, attack helicopters and transports) than Germany, France or the United Kingdom. Turkey\u2019s navy comprises 194 ships, mostly frigates, corvettes and coastal gunships but including 12 submarines.\n\nSome analysts evaluate Turkey as among the most militarily powerful nations, ranking ninth among 137 military powers worldwide.\n\nDo we really want to kick Turkey out of NATO and have its military power and strategic geography aligned with Russia?\n\nGeographically, Turkey occupies some of the most strategically important territory in the world. It is the only NATO member state in the Middle East, bordering Syria and Iraq, near Lebanon and Israel, a region that has been \u2014 and continues to be \u2014 the crucial crossroads of empire and history since biblical times. Turkey controls the Bosporus Straits, Marmara Sea and Dardanelles Straits between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, giving it the capability to contain Russia\u2019s powerful Black Sea Fleet. Turkey\u2019s geographic location and strong military makes it the anchor of NATO\u2019s southern flank against Russian aggression.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTurkey also is an unsinkable aircraft carrier, with 98 airports capable of supporting NATO air operations over the Middle East, Black Sea and the Balkans.\n\nIt is one of only five NATO states (the others being Germany, Italy, Belgium and The Netherlands) storing U.S. tactical nuclear weapons on its territory. Some 50 B-61 nuclear bombs are bunkered at Incirlik Air Force Base, controlled by U.S. personnel stationed there.\n\nWashington\u2019s foreign policy elites are so fixated on recent Kurdish contributions to defeating the Islamic State (ISIS) that they seem to have forgotten Turkey\u2019s much longer record as an ally of the U.S. and NATO:\n\nTurkey fought alongside the U.S. during the Korean War (1950-1953).\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the early Cold War, Turkey agreed to basing U.S. nuclear bombers and IRBMs on its territory, making Turkey a nuclear target for the USSR. (President Kennedy was able to avoid nuclear war with the Soviet Union and resolve the October 1962 Cuban missile crisis by secretly promising Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to remove the U.S. IRBMs.)\n\n\n\n\n\nTurkey joined the U.S. and NATO in bombing Bosnia during Operation Deliberate Force (1995).\n\nTurkey joined the U.S. and NATO in bombing Serbia during Operation Allied Force (1999).\n\n\n\n\n\nTurkey participated in Baltic Sea air patrols demonstrating support for the NATO Baltic states (2006).\n\n\n\n\n\nFor years and continuing today, Turkish forces have participated in NATO peacekeeping in Bosnia and Kosovo.\n\n\n\n\n\nTurkey provided military and intelligence support to U.S. operations that destroyed the ISIS terrorist \u201ccaliphate.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s membership in NATO quelled the long cycle of conflicts and wars with Greece, also a NATO member. Significantly, even Turkey\u2019s controversial invasion of Cyprus in 1974 did not trigger a war with Greece, in no small part because both are NATO members.\n\nUnfortunately, Turkey under President Erdogan is abandoning secularism and democratic norms, becoming an Islamist authoritarian state, and pulling away from the U.S. and NATO. Indeed, Erdogan is beginning to align Turkey with Russia, buying Russian military equipment over U.S. objections.\n\nErdogan even has threatened to develop nuclear weapons, which justifies withdrawing U.S. tactical nuclear weapons from Turkey. Yet Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel and other Middle East allies all have legitimate fear of Iran developing nuclear missiles, so threatened nuclear proliferation by Turkey and others may be a sign of U.S. failure to uphold its alliance obligations through credible extended nuclear deterrence and other means.\n\nTurkey controls the flow of Middle Eastern refugees into European NATO, a crucial role whereby a friendly Turkey can help stabilize its neighbors \u2014 or an unfriendly Turkey could unleash a human flood into Europe.\n\nIsrael, too, will be better served if Turkey remains in NATO and, thus, a moderating influence on Islamist Erdogan, who eventually may be replaced by a secular leader. Imagine the threat to U.S. and Israeli interests if Turkey leaves NATO and becomes another Islamist rogue state like Iran.\n\nTurkey\u2019s withdrawal from NATO may, or may not, be historically inevitable. But the United States should do everything possible to keep such a valuable ally in NATO and prevent Turkey from becoming a dangerous foe.\n\nDr. Peter Vincent Pry was chief of staff of the Congressional EMP Commission and served on the staff of the House Armed Services Committee and at the CIA.
