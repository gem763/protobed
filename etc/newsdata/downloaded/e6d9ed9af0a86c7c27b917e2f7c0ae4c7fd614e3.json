Most food items will remain exempt.\n\nConsumers will be eligible for a 5% rebate on purchases made using electronic payments at some smaller retailers - outstripping the 2% tax rise.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe move is designed to mitigate the impact of the tax increase, as well as drive up the use of electronic payments in cash-reliant Japan.\n\nMartin Schulz, senior research fellow at the Fujitsu Research Institute, said the rebates are designed \"to make the economy more productive\".\n\nHow will it impact the economy?\n\nJapan's economy has performed strongly in recent months but the tax hike - along with uncertainty in the global economy - weigh on its outlook.\n\nThe slowdown in China and the trade war with the US have knocked business confidence in Japan, as it also grapples with softer global demand for its exports including electronic equipment and car parts.\n\nPrevious sales tax rises have seen spending drop off sharply. But this time around, economists expect the hit will be more modest.\n\n\"The impact will almost certainly be smaller,\" Mr Thieliant said, as the lead-up to the tax rise saw fewer pre-emptive purchases of big items like televisions and cars than previous hikes. The rebate plan for electronic payments may also have helped.\n\nMr Schulz agrees spending will fall in the coming months but the economy should recover by the end of the year.\n\n\"The economy is comparatively strong. Next year it may be strong because of [Japan hosting] the Olympics... but it very much depends on the external environment and the trade war,\" he said.", "description": "The rise comes despite concerns the move will slow spending in the world's third largest economy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A7BF/production/_109034924_japantraintax.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
