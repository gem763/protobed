Both of our neighbours have also been complaining about the smell, it makes us feel sick,\" added the 58-year-old who has been living in the property since 2003.\n\nCouple Mr and Mrs Gorton who live next door to the family have also been affected by the faulty piping.\n\nClaire Gorton, 60, said: \"We've only been living here 16 months and came out here because we thought that it was a lovely spot and there was plenty of fresh air.\"\n\n(Image: Peter Evans)\n\n(Image: Peter Evans)\n\n\"But our garden is only a couple of metres from the sewage and we've had problems with flies. Our cat has landed in the sewage and we've had to bathe her. There's also worries with the affect it's having on our health. We've phoned Welsh water loads of times,\" she added.\n\nThe disgusting mess has also been attracting scavenger birds and crows which have been picking at the waste and dropping it all over the family's garden, including in their garden pond - the family have been forced to cover the pond with a net to protect their pet fish.\n\n\"It's affected us massively as a family. My daughter is football crazy and can't even go outside to kick the ball around. My little niece wants to go outside and play in the garden but she can't, we're just at the end of our tether and nothing is being done about it.\n\n\"We've spoken to Natural Resources Wales and the environmental health but they say that it isn't a health hazard. Every time we go on holiday now it builds up if it's been raining and it's just a mess,\" added the dad of two.\n\n(Image: Peter Evans)\n\nA Welsh Water spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of issues regarding external sewer flooding at Mr Evans\u2019 property in Neath, and have undertaken a number of investigations to identify the cause and possible solutions. This is primarily due to capacity issues in parts of the network near the property.\n\n\u201cWe will shortly be carrying out CCTV surveys of the sewer network around the property to pinpoint where the network needs more capacity and how we can remedy this. We are also looking into managing our network so we can relieve the pressure at certain points, to ensure the land is better protected.\n\n\u201cWe are very sorry for the inconvenience and distress this is causing and are committed to developing a permanent solution to this issue and working with Mr Evans to achieve this.\u201d", "description": "Peter Evans bought the land directly behind his house two years ago to stop developers from blocking his view - but had no idea of the disgusting problems to come", "authors": ["Bethan Thomas", "Image", "Peter Evans"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20761800.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Peter-Evans.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
