It was feared that Darnold could have been out for about eight weeks but he appeared at practice last week prior to the Jets\u2019 blowout loss against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nTAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS OFFENSIVE LINEMAN PLAYED WITH BROKEN ARM, BRUCE ARIANS SAYS\n\n\u201cI feel good. Energy\u2019s awesome,\u201d Darnold told ESPN New York\u2019s \u201cThe Michael Kay Show\u201d on Monday prior to his official clearance. \u201cJust looking to play this week, but [have to] wait for the doctor\u2019s orders tomorrow. I\u2019m excited to hear the news, I have a feeling it\u2019s going to be good news.\n\n\u201cI thought maybe it would come last week, but had to wait it out again. Hopefully this week it\u2019s better news and I get to practice and get ready for a game on Sunday.\u201d\n\nDarnold was at the helm during the Jets\u2019 first game of the season against the Buffalo Bills. The Jets lost the game 17-16 and have lost every game since then.\n\nAJ GREEN TRADE RUMORS BRING STERN WARNING FROM BENGALS CORNERBACK: 'IT BETTER NOT HAPPEN'\n\nJets coach Adam Gase said Monday the team still has to get better even with Darnold\u2019s return.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably more than just Sam getting out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of other things to clean up. Sam is able to hide things sometimes for us, where if we make a mistake, he covers it up. I think we just need to do a better job as a group making sure that all 11 are on the same page.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nIn Darnold\u2019s absence, the Jets have used Trevor Siemian and Luke Falk as the quarterbacks. Siemian was injured in his first game against the Cleveland Browns and Falk has not been the player the Jets thought could have got the job done in Darnold\u2019s absence.", "description": "New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold has been cleared to return to play the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday and will start, the team announced.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
