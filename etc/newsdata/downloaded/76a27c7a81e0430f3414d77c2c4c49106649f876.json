(conservative.ca)\n\nOn Saturday, The Globe and Mail reported that despite Scheer's claim to have been a broker, the newspaper could find no evidence that he had received the accreditation needed to be a broker before he was elected to the House of Commons in 2004, when he was only 25.\n\nScheer worked as a political staffer before and after his brief stint in the insurance business in Regina.\n\nProvincial legislation prohibits calling yourself a broker unless you hold a licence.\n\nOn Sunday, Liberal candidate Marco Mendicino suggested Scheer had been misrepresenting his qualifications and called for an investigation by the Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority of Saskatchewan and the Insurance Councils of Saskatchewan.\n\nRon Fullan, executive director of the insurance councils, confirmed receipt of Mendicino's letter.\n\n\"We are currently reviewing it.
