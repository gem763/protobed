But they were all lost - including a narrow defeat to Italy - making it the first time Canada was beaten in every game at a World Cup.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got some really good memories of it on the personal performance side of things, but nothing for me gets measured on my personal accolades. It\u2019s more about what happens with the team,\u201d he said. \u201cBittersweet is probably the best way to sum up that World Cup.\u201d\n\nVan der Merwe is appearing in his fourth World Cup and almost didn\u2019t make this one - because Canada had to play in a three-match repechage tournament to qualify.\n\nHe made the difference - albeit against mediocre opposition - by scoring two tries as Canada beat Hong Kong 27-10 to become the last team through to Japan. He sealed victory with a surging run down the left flank, breaking three tackles before lunging over the line under November rain in Marseille.\n\nHe was mobbed by his whooping teammates and with good reason, for Canada upheld its record of appearing at every World Cup and likely avoided a perilous financial situation. As a senior player, and a proven finisher the others look up to, van der Merwe perhaps felt the weight of expectation even more than his teammates.\n\n\u201cIt was a big fright. There was a lot of pressure on us,\u201d he said. \u201cThe future of the youngsters in the grassroots levels for Rugby Canada was at stake in that game. Those are things that are going through your mind, not just the money, but where the program would be if we didn\u2019t make it to a World Cup, the funding we\u2019d lose.\u201d\n\nQualification came as a huge relief to a Canada side which has chopped and changed coaches regularly since the 2015 World Cup.\n\n\u201cA lot of disruption, which has not been ideal, and we made (Canada\u2019s rugby) union aware that we\u2019re not happy about that,\u201d said van der Merwe, who has spent more than a decade scoring tries in the fields of Wales, England and Scotland for Scarlets, Newcastle Falcons and Glasgow Warriors.\n\nNow with Welshman Kingsley Jones in charge of Canada since 2017, there has been some stability.\n\n\u201cThis time around we\u2019ve got a good balance of youth and older guys,\u201d van der Merwe said. \u201cThe older guys can probably put a cap on the excitement and be a bit more level-headed, and you can use the youth to be exuberant and just play without fear.\u201d\n\nOne of the veterans is prop Hubert Buydens, who at nearly 38 is the third-oldest Canadian to feature at a Rugby World Cup after Mark Cardinal and Spencer McTavish.\n\nBuydens and van der Merwe were both on the field eight years ago in New Zealand, when Canada beat Tonga 25-20 for its previous World Cup win.\n\nVan der Merwe didn\u2019t score in that game, but fully intends to extend his national record of six World Cup tries in Fukuoka on Thursday.\n\nTwo more tries will take him up to 200 points for Canada.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup\n\nand https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Having done his part to get Canada to the Rugby World Cup at the last minute, veteran winger DTH van der Merwe wants to help his country qualify for the next one.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
