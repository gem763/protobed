Trump is quoted telling Zelensky that Yovanovitch was \"bad news.\"\n\nYovanovitch's appearance comes on the same day that US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland said through his lawyer that he will comply with a House subpoena and testify to Congress next week as part of the investigation, despite a State Department order not to.\n\nSondland, a wealthy donor to Trump's 2016 campaign, was part of text message chains discussing the president's effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, amid concern by some diplomats in the messages that the administration was leveraging military aid on the political favor.\n\nDemocrats hope the diplomats and others will help flesh out details of Trump's actions related to Ukraine.\n\nSenate Democrat Chris Murphy said he got to know Yovanovitch on a trip to Ukraine and called her \"a true patriot.\"\n\n\"I'm proud that she is testifying before the House today,\" he tweeted. \"Others should follow her example.\"", "description": "The former US ambassador to Ukraine arrived at Congress Friday for a deposition before lawmakers eager to learn what she knows about an administration pressure campaign on Kiev that triggered an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.
