It's the worst thing I've had to do\u2026\"\n\nShe added: \"I think it's almost worse for those close to you because they're trying to look after and protect the person who's poorly, not just physically, but emotionally.\"\n\n(Image: Rex Features)\n\nIn a statement, her family said: \"It is with the deepest sadness that Leah Bracknell's family confirm that Leah passed away in September, three years after her diagnosis with stage 4 lung cancer.\n\n\"They would like to thank all the public for their support and generosity which contributed to the extension and quality of her life over the past three years.\n\n\"Leah continued to embrace life and faced her illness with positivity. Many aspects of her journey can be found on her blog.\n\n\"Leah was best known and much loved as Zoe Tate in Emmerdale.\n\n\"She also had roles in Judge John Deed, A Touch of Frost, The Royal Today and DCI Banks to name just a few, as well as numerous appearances on stage and in pantomime.\n\n\"As well as acting, Leah was also an accomplished yoga teacher and shamanic healer.\n\n\"Leah had an energy and enthusiasm for life, a kind heart and much love to give to those around her.\n\n\"Her family have asked for privacy at this very sad time.\"", "description": "Emmerdale star Leah Bracknell, who played Zoe Tate in the ITV soap, has died at the age of 55 after losing her fight with lung cancer", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Leah'S Cancer Fund", "Daily Record", "Itv", "Rex Features"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12012771.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Leahs-Cancer-Fund.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
