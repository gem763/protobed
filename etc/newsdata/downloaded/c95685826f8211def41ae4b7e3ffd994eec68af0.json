They should have known when to stop and also ignored the opportunity to be driven home using cars laid on by the club, and chose to stay out.\n\n\u201cAs a result of an alcohol-related incident, Richard Keogh has sustained a serious knee injury that will prevent him from playing until the end of the season.\n\n\u201cThe players involved in the incident on Tuesday evening will be subject to a rigorous internal investigation under the club\u2019s code of conduct and disciplinary procedures, but over and above any punishment they receive we will be expecting them to become involved with the excellent work the Community Trust does helping the communities we serve.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe have been very clear about our attitude towards alcohol and the players know that at certain and specific times of the season they are permitted a drink together as a group in a controlled environment.\n\n\u201cThose involved in Tuesday\u2019s incident know they will pay a heavy price for their actions, but also that we will support them with their rehabilitation back into the squad and team.\n\n\u201cWe fully support the work of our partners at Drinkaware and the unsanctioned actions of this small group of players is totally at odds the stance that both Drinkaware and Derby County Football Club take regards alcohol. We will be using this situation to redouble our efforts in highlighting the dangers posed by alcohol.\n\n\u201cWe would also like to thank the emergency services for their swift help.\u201d\n\nDerby will be back in Championship action on Saturday when they take in a home date with midlands rivals Birmingham City.", "description": "The Rams have confirmed that their club captain will miss the remainder of the 2019-20 campaign after being caught up in an incident on Tuesday night", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mEz3tJsw_tZhY4VetiR9gQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SBtj.GF9iO.bMCCQ6VvwSg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/4a6d1ef0ad6301fec417f6cc89c910b6", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
