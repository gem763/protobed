But the blast in Suluk, controlled by Ankara's rebel proxies, killed three fighters, a rebel commander there told AFP.\n\nIt was unclear who was responsible.\n\nKurds staged angry demonstrations Wednesday in their de facto capital Qamishli, which is excluded from the Sochi agreement.\n\n\"This deal serves the interests of foreign powers and not the interests of the people,\" said official Talaat Youndes.\n\n\"Turkey's objective is to kill, displace and occupy the Kurds.\"\n\nTurkey's October 9 assault was made possible by a pullback of US troops deployed along the border as a buffer force between their NATO ally Turkey and the Kurdish fighters of the SDF.\n\nThe withdrawal by their erstwhile ally left the Kurds completely in the lurch, forcing them to turn to the Damascus regime for protection from an expanded Turkish offensive.\n\n- 'Separatist designs' -\n\nGovernment forces, who are backed by the Russian military, rushed north within days, ostensibly to pin back Turkish-backed rebels but also to reclaim control of swathes of territory that the regime started leaving in 2012.\n\nOn Wednesday, regime reinforcements arrived in the Raqa and Hassakeh governorates, according to state news agency SANA.\n\nDamascus has previously accused Kurds of treason over their alliance with Washington and repeatedly said it would eventually restore government control over all parts of Syria.\n\nThe Kremlin on Wednesday accused Washington of betraying the Kurds by withdrawing its forces and leaving allies alone in the face of a Turkish offensive.\n\nPentagon chief Mark Esper arrived in Baghdad for talks with his Iraqi counterpart Najah al-Shammari as Washington pulled out troops from northern Syria through Iraq.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Russian forces in Syria headed for the border with Turkey Wednesday to ensure Kurdish fighters pull back after a deal between Moscow and Ankara wrested control of the Kurds' entire heartland.
