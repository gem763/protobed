It's been nice to get over the hump and feel good again and go at it full speed.\n\n\"I'm excited to be having this end of the year run.\"\n\nWoods, wearing a dark blue sleeveless sweater, spoke at Narashino Country Club before a Monday afternoon Japan Skins made-for-TV exhibition with Rory McIlroy, Hideki Matsuyama and Jason Day.\n\nWhile that will be fun and games, it will be serious business come Thursday.\n\nIt will be 43-year-old's final chance to assess his form and fitness before deciding whether to include himself as a player on the United States team that he will captain at the Presidents Cup in Australia in December.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Both; editing by Richard Pullin)", "description": "By Andrew BothCHIBA, Japan, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Tiger Woods on Monday declared himself", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
