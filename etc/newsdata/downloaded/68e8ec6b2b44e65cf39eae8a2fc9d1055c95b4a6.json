launch, Simon, 60, revealed the reason why he decided to revamp the normal show into a celebrity version.\n\n'It just felt so obvious to do a celebrity version', he explained. 'The only condition was I couldn\u2019t know who was going to be on it.

I swear to God I didn\u2019t have a clue who any of the acts were. I did walk away thinking, \u201cIf we\u2019re smart, we have artists here who could actually sell records off the back of this\u201d. So I thought that was fun and very exciting for the show.'\n\nThe music boss also shared how he felt about holding the auditions in his own back garden.\n\nHe said: 'When we filmed it that night it didn\u2019t feel like work. I loved every second of it. I said to the producers, \u201cIf this really doesn\u2019t work, we will have to re-audition for the show. That\u2019s the deal.\u201d\n\n'So the fact that I felt we didn\u2019t need to was just great. I found it interesting and fun, and doing this version of the show has also given me the chance to do All Stars. I\u2019ve wanted to make the best of the best version of The X Factor for a long, long time. It\u2019s been brilliant. I\u2019ve loved every minute.'\n\nMeanwhile, returning judge Louis, 67, revealed why he's so excited about the show, adding that the contestants are not what people will expect.\n\nContestants: Journalist Martin Bashir, left, Glee star Kevin McHale, centre, and EastEnders star Jonny Labey, far right, at the photocall\n\nFun times: Cole & Edwards - made up of Strictly star Brendan Cole, 43 and actor Jeremy Edwards, 48, playfully posed on the red carpet\n\nFamily: Presenters and twins Max and Harvey, both 16, posed together on the red carpet\n\nHe said: 'What we\u2019re doing this year I think is a brilliant idea.

Some of them are really good.\n\n'The show feels more exciting, there\u2019s no bootcamp, no six chair challenge, it feels slick this year. It\u2019s been the best show on TV for a long time and has just had a little rebranding, I suppose, a new X Factor.'\n\nWhile Nicole explained why the celebrity version differs from the civilian edition.\n\nShe explained: 'Obviously it\u2019s a lot shorter, which is the difference between The X Factor: Celebrity and the ones in the past. This one doesn\u2019t have boot camp and all that jazz, and I loved that we just cut straight to the chase. I was really excited to see who the celebrities were going to be.'\n\nX Factor: Nicole joined fellow judge Louis Walsh but one member of the judging panel who appeared to be missing was show creator Simon Cowell\n\nPresenter: Dermot O'Leary looked dapper for the photocall in dark trousers with a black top and brown suede dress shoes\n\nAnd the Don't Hold Your Breath hitmaker ensured that she'll be as competitive as ever this year.\n\n'Oh always!' she insisted. 'You can\u2019t take that out of me! I\u2019m just going to be very supportive. This year I think the way Simon has done it is that we help them and support them. In the past when I did it, I was quite hands-on and did a lot. But I\u2019m ready to see what they are going to bring to this show.'\n\nThis series, like the civilian version, will see the acts split into three groups; the overs, the unders and the groups.\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity starts Saturday 12th October 8:35pm on ITV.", "description": "Megan, 27, opted to go braless in a black and white patterned suit with a plunging figure-hugging blazer and matching flared trousers.", "authors": ["Olivia Wheeler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/15/19495476-0-image-a-4_1570631283170.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
