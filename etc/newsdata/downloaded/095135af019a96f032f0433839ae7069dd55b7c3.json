Enter the Rule of 150.\n\n\"Since the extra ownership costs are approximately equal to the interest of a typical mortgage over nine years, and the interest is approximately 50% of your mortgage payment during that time, you have to multiply your monthly mortgage payment by 150%,\" they wrote. \"This is how much your house will actually cost per month, once all expenses are factored in.\"\n\nIf the Rule of 150 monthly cost is higher than your rent, keep renting. If it's lower, it's time to buy.\n\nRenting or buy doesn't always boil down to math\n\nHowever, Tanja Hester, who retired at 38, said that the issue of renting or buying a home isn't always a question of simple math.\n\nIn her book, \" Work Optional: Retire Early the Non-Penny-Pinching Way,\" she said that it really comes down to whether you value certainty or flexibility more.\n\nRead more: 5 millennials who became homeowners in their 20s share their best advice for buying your first house\n\nBuying a home can be an investment and offers the certainty of a fixed mortgage payment, but it also comes with a lot of unexpected costs \u2014 and it can take a while to build equity, she said. Renting is typically more affordable and flexible, and offers an opportunity to build greater savings, but gives residents less control over the property.\n\n\"The question of whether to rent or buy is also a highly personal one, not a simple math problem, with a number of variables such as what your local market dynamics are, which arrangement feels better to you, how attached you want to be to one place, how important it is to you to customize your space, and whether you want to tie up resources to save for a down payment rather than saving for another goal (like early retirement),\" she wrote.", "description": "Multiplying your monthly mortgage payment by 150% will show you how much your house will cost per month with all expenses, say two early retirees.", "authors": ["Hillary Hoffower"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8235002e22af75d14c1249-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
