Purity was the movement\u2019s game, not his. Paul reminded me that he worked on his father\u2019s 1988 Libertarian Party presidential campaign and felt a great deal of sympathy for anyone trying to take on the major parties. \u201cI also gathered signatures to get him on the ballot,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what a thankless job that is. Anybody who stands in a parking lot is thought to be an extremist.\u201d\n\nBut later, with an irritated edge to his voice, Paul added: \u201cSome people are purists, and I get grief all the time \u2014 all these libertarian websites hating on me because I\u2019m not as pure as my dad. And I\u2019m putting restrictions on foreign aid instead of eliminating foreign aid altogether. And I\u2019m like: \u2018Look, guys, I\u2019m having trouble putting these restrictions on, much less eliminating them! So give me a break!\u2019 \u201d\n\nThis June I watched Nick Gillespie deliver the keynote address at PorcFest, the annual libertarian outdoor festival held in Lancaster, N.H., and named for the area\u2019s ubiquitous porcupine. About 500 campers sat attentively, while several others stood off to the side, Hula-Hooping as they listened. Arrayed before Gillespie were several boxes of exotically flavored Pop-Tarts that he had purchased at the Lancaster grocery store. He held them up as evidence that individualism was flourishing and choices were in abundance or, as he put it, \u201cThe libertarian moment is now.\u201d Their moment had arrived, Gillespie said, \u201cbecause the main political drivers have destroyed their credibility. Only the dead think the G.O.P. is the party of small government.\u201d At the same time, he added, \u201cthe Democrats had a clean shot to demonstrate that they\u2019d protect our liberties, and they proved themselves to be utter frauds.\u201d\n\nWith deadpan aplomb, Gillespie then said, \u201cIf we can have 20 different types of Pop-Tarts, maybe we can have more than two types of political identification.\u201d\n\nAfter the speech was over and Gillespie gamely posed for a few pictures with admirers, I cornered him and asked him if he was suggesting that libertarians leave the G.O.P.-flavored Pop-Tarts on the shelf. Gillespie said it all depended on Republicans. \u201cThis is the fundamental question for the Republican Party,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they going to embrace the libertarian elements of Rand Paul and Justin Amash? Because that\u2019s their only way out. They\u2019re at 25 percent self-identification, and it\u2019s not going to climb back up if they keep re-electing the old horses. Libertarians don\u2019t need them. We\u2019re already alienated and out of the mainstream. We don\u2019t need the Republican Party in the way that they need the energy and the vision of libertarians.\u201d\n\nBut, I wanted to know, would libertarians be willing to meet the G.O.P. somewhere in the middle? Among the 1,700 or so attendees, I had seen guns and Bitcoins and slogans like \u201cLiberty: Too Big to Fail\u201d and \u201cI Do Not Consent to Searches.\u201d What I had not seen or heard was any show of support for Rand Paul. The crowd here at PorcFest, many of them young, all of them passionate, represented just the sort of army that Paul would need in the early primary states and beyond \u2014 the same sort of army, in fact, that powered his father\u2019s improbable showing in previous elections. But they still talked more about the father than the son.\n\nGillespie acknowledged that the answer remained unclear. \u201cI think that if a major-party candidate articulates 75 percent of the catechism,\u201d he said, \u201cboth self-identified libertarians and people who don\u2019t realize they\u2019re libertarians would vote for him.\u201d But then again, he said, it might take \u201ca hundred years or something\u201d for his movement to find its true expression in a political party. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a movement that didn\u2019t exist, then we all believe in this roughly similar thing, then we have a dalliance with the G.O.P., then we realize, no, we\u2019re totally separate. And then we find out, no, we really need to activate politically in a conventional two-party system,\u201d he said, his tone betraying little concern for the pace of this process. \u201cAnd it may be we\u2019re still some years away from that. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nOur libertarian moment, in other words, might very well pass unexploited. But it remained, for Gillespie and his fellow travelers, a moment to savor: Pop-Tarts washed down with Green Hat gin. Interesting stuff was happening in the garage called America, and you could try to change the system, or you could also elect to be boring.
