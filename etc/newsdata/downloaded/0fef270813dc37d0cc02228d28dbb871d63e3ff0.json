In cases where bosses distribute tips among workers, the bill will require them to do so \u201con a fair and transparent basis\u201d. A statutory code of practice will set out the principles of such fair and transparent allocation.\n\nIn some sectors, tips, gratuities and service charges make up a significant share of employees\u2019 income. But ministers have found that a minority of employers retain their workers\u2019 tips. Evidence in 2016 showed that around two-thirds of employers in the hospitality sector were making deductions from staff tips, in some cases taking as much as 10 per cent.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nUnfair tipping practices could become more entrenched as consumers increasingly pay tips on card rather than in cash directly to the workers, the government said, noting that nearly 80 per cent of tips are now made on card, according to its estimates.\n\nIf voted on and passed, the bill will apply to England, Wales and Scotland. The Labour Party and trade unions support the legislation.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. UK news in pictures Show all 53 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.
