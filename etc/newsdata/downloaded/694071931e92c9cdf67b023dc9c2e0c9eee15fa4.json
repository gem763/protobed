And he said he was \u201cmindful\u201d of the argument of Fed hawks that interest rate cuts might create asset bubbles as investors seek higher yields.\n\nKaplan said he agreed with Fed critics that the monetary stance of Fed policy was too tight prior to the central bank reversing course with two rate cuts in July and September.\n\nRead: Fed grew more worried about economy at September meeting, minutes show\n\nIn an interview on Bloomberg Television, Kaplan said he didn\u2019t support the push from some Fed officials for the central bank to publicly announce when it was finished easing monetary policy.\n\nHe added that he still didn\u2019t think the Fed was on a path to cut rates to zero.\n\n\u201cI still believe\u201d that this cutting will be limited and modest and not the start of a \u201cfull-fledged cutting cycle, he said.\n\nU.S. stock-index futures drifted lower early Thursday on conflicting reports of the status of U.S.-China trade talks in Washington D.C.\n\nOn the volatility seen in the money-markets last month, Kaplan said he supports \u201cmore permanent steps\u201d to ensure the funding market functions, an apparent reference to a standing repo facility that many have called for to provide more liquidity.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.83% was up 181 points on Wednesday.", "description": "Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said Thursday that he\u2019s keeping an open mind about the need for more interest rate cuts.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HG638_kaplan_ZG_20190329083449.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
