The Straits Times\n\nStudents in Singapore will have more chances of going overseas for internships under a new programme by Enterprise Singapore.\n\nThe Global Ready Talent programme (GRT) launched on Thursday (Oct 10) already has over 60 participating Singapore companies offering 110 overseas internships and 86 management associate positions.\n\nAccording to a media statement, the aim of the GRT is to build a pipeline of talent to support Singapore companies by exposing young talent to overseas job opportunities. These stints will equip them with in-market knowledge and strong cross-cultural understanding, Enterprise Singapore said.\n\nIn 2018, a study by the Singapore Business Federation showed that seven in 10 Singapore businesses have expanded overseas. However, finding the right talent to manage their overseas operations posed the biggest challenge.\n\n61 per cent of all Singapore businesses listed finding the right talent as the biggest key challenge. Singapore Business Federation\n\nEnterprise Singapore said in a statement that the GRT programme will combat this issue by exposing young talent to in-market experiences early to help them gain \u201ccritical skills\u201d like internationalisation.\n\nThe GRT is a two-component programme which combines the existing SME Talent Programme, Young Talent Programme and Go Southeast Asia Award into one. It has funding support for both components \u2013 GRT (Internships) and GRT (Management Associate).\n\nAccording to the media statement, the internship component will enable Singapore enterprises to offer local and overseas internship placements to students from Institutes of Technical Education (ITE), polytechnics or local universities.\n\nThe other component will support enterprises posting fresh graduates or young Singaporean employees (with up to three years of work experience), to regional markets such as Southeast Asia, China and India for a minimum period of one year.\n\nA recent survey conducted by Enterprise Singapore found that 86 per cent of students and 70 per cent of graduates were willing to consider an overseas job posting in Southeast Asia. In addition, 97 per cent of the 3,750 students and graduates surveyed were open to working in a Singapore enterprise.\n\nPng Cheong Boon, chief executive officer of Enterprise Singapore, said in a statement that \u201cbesides having the right talent\u201d, companies must \u201censure that these talents have the ability to understand and navigate the markets\u201d in order to succeed in their ventures abroad.\n\n\u201cThe companies we have with us today are committed to investing in grooming their talent, and we hope to see more of such companies coming on-board this programme,\u201d he added.\n\nEnterprise Singapore will work with Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) to evaluate and qualify promising Singapore enterprises to come on board the programme, and with the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to facilitate internship placements.\n\nRead Also:", "description": "Business Insider - 86% of students and 70% of graduates were willing to consider an overseas job posting in Southeast Asia..
