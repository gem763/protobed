All charges against her were dropped.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nPhil Davis, chair of the city council\u2019s Licensing and Public Protection Committee, said: \u201cI welcome the sentence of Chetan Pal Panesar, which sends out a clear message to other rogue traders that such unscrupulous business practices will not be tolerated in our city and we will prosecute.\u201d\n\nSajeela Naseer, head of Birmingham City Council trading standards, added: \u201cThis department will do everything possible to protect consumers from rogue travel agents like Mr Panesar.\n\n\"Many of these vulnerable victims, who trusted Mr Panesar to provide flights, suffered emotionally as well as financially from the difficulties that arose from this fraudulent trading.\n\n\"It is important that consumers conduct their own research into the travel company that they are thinking of using and make sure it is really a member of ABTA and is ATOL protected by checking online.\u201d", "description": "Some scammed holidaymakers arrived at the airport with their packed luggage -\u00a0 only to find that agent Chetan Pal Panesar had pocketed the cash and left them without tickets", "authors": ["Stephanie Balloo", "Image", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20697568.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
