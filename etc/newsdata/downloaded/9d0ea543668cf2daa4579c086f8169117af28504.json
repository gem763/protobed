Battle across recognisable maps, fight as iconic heroes like Ghost and Soap, and participate in a battle royale the likes of which you\u2019ve probably seen before.\n\nIt\u2019s free to play, it\u2019s mobile, and it\u2019s what a console Call of Duty might look like if people weren\u2019t so down on microtransactions and loot boxes. They really should have subtitled it \u201cMobile Warfare.\u201d Beneath the icon in the iTunes search results it says \u201cVisceral Multiplayer!\u201d which sounds like a thing Call of Duty players are keen on.\n\nThe game runs in landscape mode instead of portrait (wide instead of tall), which was a great decision, Mario Kart Tour. The gameplay isn\u2019t too shabby. It looks nice on my iPhone XR. It\u2019s all aiming and auto-firing, but it works well on a small touchscreen.\n\nThe focus is on progression, with new gear unlocked as players climb the ranks and access new loadout slots. Weapons have experience levels as well, with better mods and attachments unlocked at higher levels. There\u2019s a store filled with cosmetic stuff to purchase and play with, daily login bonuses, special events\u2014basically plenty of things to clutter up its nice-looking home screen.\n\nPlayers can purchase in-game currency with real cash to help them make their soldier and weapons look all pretty. There\u2019s a \u201cCash Back\u201d event going on right now that involves getting bonuses for purchasing currency and makes me feel like I am trying to finance a car every time I load up the game. This is Activision and Tencent, so expect plenty of ridiculous things to buy and ways to buy them.\n\nAs for the Battle Royale, it supports up to 100 players, pulls together map locations from across many different Call of Duty games, and isn\u2019t unlocked until level 7, which might take me a while. You\u2019ll probably get there first. Let me know how it is.", "description": "After being in rigorous beta testing across multiple countries since July, Activision and Tencent\u2019s Call of Duty: Mobile is go for iOS and Android\u00a0devices everywhere but mainland China, Vietnam, and Belgium.
