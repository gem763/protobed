He was 24.\n\nHawkeyes coach Kirk Ferentz confirmed the death at Tuesday's news conference.\n\n\"On a somber note, I think all of us are very sorry to hear about Derrick Mitchell,\" Ferentz said. \"He was involved in an accident last Friday morning, and we knew that was a tough circumstance. Just a very tough thing, and way, way too young for something like that to happen.\n\n\"Feeling and condolences are certainly with his entire family.\"\n\nAfter redshirting in 2013, Mitchell Jr. had 339 total yards and three touchdowns over the next three seasons. He was Iowa's leading rusher in the 2015 Big Ten championship game and also scampered for 79 yards that season in a blowout win against No. 20 Northwestern.\n\nMitchell Jr. then fell behind in Iowa's 2016 running back rotation and opted to move on as a graduate transfer in January 2017. He was initially headed to Texas Tech but landed at Football Championship Series school Incarnate Word.\n\nMitchell Jr. was the Cardinals' leading rusher in 2017. He ran for 601 yards and five touchdowns.", "description": "Derrick Mitchell Jr., the Iowa Hawkeyes' leading rusher in the 2015 Big Ten championship game, was killed in a weekend car accident.
