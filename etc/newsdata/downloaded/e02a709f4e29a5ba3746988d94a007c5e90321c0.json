The result has been education that spends more and achieves far, far, far less,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cMy administration has been working to reverse this federal power grab and give power back to families, cities [and] states \u2014 give power back to localities.\u201d\n\nHe said that previous administrations had increasingly forced schools to comply with \u201cwhims and dictates\u201d from Washington, but his administration would break the trend.\n\n\u201cWe know local communities know it best and do it best,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who was joined by several Republican governors for the signing. \u201cThe time has come to empower teachers and parents to make the decisions that help their students achieve success.\u201d\n\nMs. DeVos and Vice President Mike Pence were on hand for the ceremony, which was attended by about 25 people, including teachers, lawmakers and the governors.\n\nThe executive order is not expected to have an immediate impact on school districts. Policy changes will follow a report on the findings of the review.\n\nThe review will be spearheaded by the Department of Education\u2019s Regulatory Review Task Force, according to the order.\n\nMs. DeVos already has authority to modify or repeal regulations that are deemed a violation of federal law. The order, however, creates a review for identifying those areas and makes clear her mandate from the president to take action.\n\nReducing the federal government\u2019s role in K-12 is part of Mr. Trump\u2019s reform agenda, which also includes the expansion of school choice programs.\n\nAmong those at the signing ceremony were Govs. Kay Ivey of Alabama, Gary Herbert of Utah, Paul LePage of Maine, Brian Sandoval of Nevada and Terry Branstad of Iowa, who also is Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for ambassador to China.\n\nAlso in attendance were Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the Republican chairs of the two chambers\u2019 education committees.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
