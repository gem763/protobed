Schiff has repeatedly done everything in his power to make sure President Trump is impeached. For more than two years he told the American people he had the smoking gun, the evidence we needed to prove Trump colluded with Russia. His hopes and dreams were crushed when Special Counsel Robert Mueller \u2013 the very guy Democrats wanted to investigate the claims \u2013 found no collusion took place.\n\nSchiff got a \"do over\" now that a whistleblower came forward claims President Trump threatened Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to Democrats, Trump threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine unless Zelensky and his team investigate Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. While Biden was handling international relations on behalf of the Obama administration, a Ukrainian oil and gas company was paying Hunter $50,000 a month, even though he had no natural energy experience. Coincidence?\n\nIt was then revealed that Schiff knew about the whistleblower's complaint for a month before it was brought in front of the Intelligence Committee. Even though a transcript of the call was released, Schiff made up his own version of what happened, or rather, what he hoped had happened.\n\nTrump has, rightfully, shredded Schiff for pushing for impeachment even though wrongdoing didn't take place. Schiff has repeatedly made it a personal mission to make sure Trump is no longer president.\n\nBut, in an ironic turn of events, progressive Darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) came to Schiff's aid, saying Trump is engaging in anti-Semitism.\n\nUnderstand that Trump is engaged in deliberate, atrocious, targeted antisemitism towards Chairman Schiff.\n\n\n\nThen ask yourself why no one cares to denounce it - esp when his accusation of it towards others drove full news cycles earlier this year. https://t.co/bjEw6eb7Md \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 5, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s harmful. And his bigotry is reflective of the white supremacist base he relies on for political gain. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 5, 2019\n\nAre. You. Kidding. Me?\n\nThis is coming from a Congresswoman who has repeatedly said immigration and customs enforcement facilities are \"concentration camps,\" similar to what took place during the Holocaust?\n\nThis is coming from a Congresswoman who got history \u2013 especially surrounding the Holocaust \u2013 so wrong that a Holocaust remembrance group had to invite her to Auschwitz with a survivor for a history lesson.\n\nThis is coming from a Congresswoman who surrounds herself with a \"Squad\" of three other women, two of which have proven time and time again to be anti-Semitic.\n\nTruth be told: we see through things. We this for what it is. Schiff is getting called out for his swampy behavior. This has nothing to do with someone being Jewish and everything to do with someone being a liar and a con artist.", "description": "Oh geez. .10/05/2019 18:43:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/151/43bd1f91-e9dd-4401-bb94-001dba19eeee.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
