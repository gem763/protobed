Hours later, he died.\n\nOwen Carey had a severe allergy to dairy. In April 2017, to celebrate his 18th birthday, Carey went to Byron Burgers\u2019 location along the River Thames in London.\n\nHe alerted staff to his dairy allergy, inquiring if the grilled chicken he was eyeing would be safe for him to eat \u2014 especially because the chain\u2019s menu, at the time, reportedly made \u201cno mention\u201d of the marinade or what ingredients it contained, including potential allergens, the BBC reported.\n\nWOMAN BATTLING RARE \u2018SUICIDE DISEASE\u2019 HAS LEG AMPUTATED IN HOPES OF FINDING RELIEF FROM CHRONIC PAIN CONDITION\n\nThe 18-year-old was seemingly satisfied with the response he received from staff members and proceeded to order the chicken. But shortly after leaving the restaurant, Carey began to feel unwell. Less than an hour later, the teen collapsed near the London Eye. He was rushed to St. Thomas's Hospital in central London, but died.\n\nSoon after, the teen\u2019s family would learn the chicken Carey ate was marinated in buttermilk, sparking his anaphylactic reaction. Though Carey typically carried an EpiPen, he did not have it with him the day he ate the buttermilk-laden chicken, according to the Guardian.\n\nFollowing an inquest into Carey\u2019s death, a coroner on Friday announced at Southwark Coroner\u2019s Court that Carey was misled into thinking the chicken was safe for him to eat.\n\nCarey, according to statement read in court by assistant coroner Briony Ballard, \u201cdied from a severe food-induced anaphylactic reaction from food eaten and ordered at a restaurant despite making staff aware of his allergies,\u201d according to the British Press Association.\n\n\"Owen was the shining light in our family.\" \u2014 Emma Kocher, Owen Carey's sister\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe menu was reassuring in that it made no reference to any marinade or potential allergenic ingredients in the food selected. The deceased was not informed that there were allergens in the order.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe food served to and consumed by the deceased contained dairy which caused the deceased to suffer a severe anaphylactic reaction from which he died.\u201d\n\nCarey\u2019s family is now pushing for new laws on allergen labeling in restaurants.\n\n\"Owen was the shining light in our family,\" the teen\u2019s sister, Emma Kocher, said in a statement outside of court.\n\n\u201cWe want restaurants to have to display clear allergen information on each individual dish on their menus. The food industry should put the safety of their customers first,\u201d she continued.\n\nMOM CELEBRATES PREMATURE SON'S FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL AFTER TOLD HE WOULD LIKELY DIE: 'HE'S MY LITTLE MIRACLE'\n\n\u201cIt is simply not good enough to have a policy which relies on verbal communication between the customer and their server, which often takes place in a busy, noisy restaurant where the turnover of staff is high and many of their customers are very young,\u201d she added.\n\nAimee Leitner-Hopps, Byron\u2019s technical manager, told the Guardian the allergy information on the chain's menu \"met industry standards\" at the time of Carey's death.\n\n\u201cIf you have an allergy you should be asking for information and the team would be able to provide that information in the allergy guide,\" she said, adding staff had also received online allergen training.\n\n\"It was apparent to me training available to the teams was sufficient,\" she noted.\n\nOn its online menu, Byron\u2019s now mentions the buttermilk marinade used on some of its chicken dishes.\n\n\"We cannot guarantee that our kitchens or our suppliers are 100 percent allergen-free,\" the menu reads.\n\n\"While our teams adhere to strict standards, we do prepare food in a kitchen and bar area where allergens, including gluten, are present. We do not declare every ingredient used within a dish on this menu. If you have any specific dietary requirements or allergies, we have a comprehensive allergy guide to help you make the right choice for you \u2013 please ask our team for a copy of the allergy guide before you place your order,\" it continues.", "description": "A United Kingdom teen celebrating his 18th birthday went for a meal at a popular burger joint in London.
