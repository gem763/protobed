A no-contest plea, unlike a guilty plea, is an acceptance of the court's punishment without an admission of guilt.\n\nThe defendants were juveniles at the time of the alleged crimes, and their names have not been publicly released, said the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office.\n\nAs The Daily Beast reported two years ago, the case began in March 2017, when 13 La Vernia High School students\u2014many of them varsity athletes on the football, baseball, and basketball teams\u2014were arrested in the alleged sexual abuse of at least 10 victims. Authorities have said they used deodorant bottles, cardboard rods, flashlights, soda bottles, pipes, and baseball bats to sodomize their younger teammates.\n\nIn the 30 months since, most of the 13 accused boys\u2014many of them now men\u2014have walked free on bail during the investigation, gassing up their trucks at the local H-E-B grocery and grabbing food at Whataburger, while still living near their alleged victims.\n\nThe judge, who reportedly called the case \u201ca tragedy of society,\u201d approved each of the plea deals Friday, which will include five years of probation. One of defendants was ordered to serve 100 hours of community service, and three others were ordered to serve 200 hours each. Some of the defendants were also fined, KENS5-TV reported.\n\nAn attorney for one of the teens told a reporter on Friday that his client was just \u201chappy to put this behind us.\u201d\n\nMore plea hearings in the case are scheduled for Oct. 21 and Nov. 26.\n\nThe rape scandal rocked La Vernia, a lush, green town just 30 miles southeast of San Antonio, spackled with farms, historical markers, donut shops, and about a dozen churches. Trailer homes and pristine mini-mansions alike populate the area, and most drama still takes place under the Friday Night Lights at football games.\n\nBut in March 2017, officers informed the parents of at least 10 players that their sons had been sodomized by their teammates.\n\nWhen a La Vernia police officer told Michelle* that her son, a gifted player on the high-school football team, had been among the victims, she sobbed angrily:\n\n\u201cWhat did they use on my son?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019d rather not tell you,\u2019\u201d the officer allegedly responded. \u201c\u2018You don\u2019t want to know.\u2019\u201d\n\nAbout six months after the scandal broke, Michelle and her family moved out of town. The self-described \u201csports mom\u201d lived in La Vernia for years, attending one of the big churches within city limits before the area even acquired an H-E-B\u2014that typical Texan symbol that town residents claim separates longtime residents from newcomers.\n\nAfter the arrests, and several angry school board meetings, the case was taken up by the Texas Rangers and the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office. Updates for the victims and their families were rare. Michelle even ran into some of the suspects in the grocery store.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201ctypical for La Vernia,\u201d Michelle said in 2017, to \u201csweep it all under the rug.\u201d\n\nNow, she\u2019s relieved that someone is finally facing consequences, Michelle told The Daily Beast on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still angry about the whole thing and I want them to pay for what they did,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt was very upsetting to me that everything seemed to disappear and was forgotten,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much corruption and drama there.\u201d\n\nAs for her son, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to talk about it,\u201d Michelle said.\n\nIn addition to the criminal cases, two families filed civil lawsuits against the school district, including one in Jan. 2018 that claimed a teenage basketball player was raped more than 30 times in just five months at teammates\u2019 homes, during basketball practice, in the La Vernia High School locker room, in a shower at the school, at other schools\u2019 gyms, and elsewhere. That lawsuit claimed that a La Vernia coach witnessed and ignored at least two violent assaults that traumatized their son, despite the boy \u201cscreaming and yelling as loud as he could.\u201d\n\nAccording to multiple interviews with mothers of purported victims and claims in the lawsuit, boys who were promoted to varsity teams began showering with underwear on in hopes that it would deter their assailants. The ripped, bloody underwear was shoved down drains, clogging the pipes in the locker room, the La Vernia mothers told The Daily Beast in 2017.\n\nAnother civil lawsuit in April 2017 claimed that school\u2019s coaches \u201csanctioned these rituals\u201d and \u201cturned a blind eye toward the abuse.\u201d The two cases have since been consolidated, and they are set to go to trial against the school district in February 2020.\n\nSan Antonio-based Attorney Fidel Rodriguez, Jr., who represents one of the victims bringing legal action, said on Friday that his client \u201cis finally vindicated for having the courage to come forth and report these inhumane actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur client is relieved that the truth has finally surfaced and that the community can begin the healing process,\u201c said Rodriguez. \u201cThese past two years have been very difficult for our client, who was ostracized by his classmates at the high school and considered to be a \u2018snitch\u2019 for standing up against the misplaced culture to the point that he had to transfer schools.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the pleas this week, four other former players were indicted by a Wilson County grand jury in June. Alejandro Ibarra, Dustin Norman, Colton Weidner, and Christian \u201cBrock\u201d Roberts, all now 20 years old, were formally charged with engaging in organized criminal activity in the case.\n\nThe June indictments allege that Norman held down a boy in Aug. 2016 and sodomized him with a cardboard rod; that he held down the same boy in September and raped him with a shampoo bottle; and that he held down another boy in November and sodomized him with a CO2 air bottle. Meanwhile, Ibarra\u2019s indictment lists the same dates and objects allegedly used to assault the same boys, who are identified in the documents only as juvenile #57 and juvenile #65.\n\nRoberts\u2019 indictment alleges that in five different instances he used his finger to assault four different boys between Nov. 2016 and Feb. 2017. On another occasion, he allegedly used a flashlight. Lastly, Weidner\u2019s indictment lists the same five occasions and instruments of assault as Roberts, involving the same victims, who are identified in the paperwork only as juveniles #119, #97, #39, and #112.\n\nAll four of the men who were indicted have consistently denied their involvement in the case. Dustin Norman\u2019s attorney, Alfonso Cabanas, told The Daily Beast in June that the allegations against his client \u201chave no merit and have done nothing more than continue to ruin an innocent person\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nFormer Superintendent Jose Moreno was heavily criticized for his handling of the alleged crimes and resigned in Nov. 2017, taking a job soon afterward as superintendent of Robstown Independent School District.\n\nBut the embattled district has remained mired in scandal, even after Moreno\u2019s departure. His replacement, Trent Lovette, was accused of inappropriately touching a high-school cheerleader at a football game in August, an incident which police are still investigating. Meanwhile, other accusations against the new superintendent have surfaced, including claims from a female employee who said she saw sexual content on Lovette\u2019s work computer.\n\nLovette said the past several months of allegations against him have taken a toll on his health, and he went on an indefinite medical leave of absence earlier this week.\n\n\u201cMy leave will be effective immediately,\u201d Lovette said. \u201cAt present, I am not in condition to be the effective leader this district needs and deserves. During this time away I will focus on restoring my health and working to heal my family of the deep wounds from the allegations and attacks against me,\u201d Lovette said on Monday.\n\n*Michelle\u2019s identity has been concealed to protect the identity of her son, an alleged sexual-assault victim.", "description": "Their pleas mark the first time athletes have faced justice in the mass sexual-assault and bullying case that victimized 10 boys.", "authors": ["Olivia Messer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570269735/191004-Messer-Texas-High-School-tease_osakho", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
