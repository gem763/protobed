According to its website, ZZ2 cultivates mainly tomatoes and avocados in Tzaneen.\n\n\"It slithered into the engine compartment presumably for the warmth while the truck was loading tomatoes,\" Garrett said. He recalled it being cold on the day in question.\n\n\"On the way to the packhouse, the driver noticed that something was wrong. On investigation, they found the snake.\"\n\nHe said the engine had to be stripped, which took a few hours, but eventually the snake was extracted.\n\n\"It was completely uninjured, but obviously a little traumatised by the incident.\"\n\nGarrett confirmed the python was released back into the wild.\n\nAccording to his estimation, the snake was about 6m long.", "description": "A massive python caused quite the stir in Tzaneen, Limpopo, when it slithered into the engine compartment of a truck, presumably to escape the cold.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9434/006888048f9f48bd893413e435d678cb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
