Back in 1999, there was President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe dates here are important.\n\nOn February 12, 1999, Clinton\u2019s U.S. Senate impeachment trial concluded with his acquittal. After a grueling scandal that began with Clinton\u2019s appalling affair with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky, which led to him committing perjury, it was finally over and behind him.\n\nOn February 24, twelve days after Clinton had been safely acquitted, Dateline NBC finally ran the story of Juanita Broaddrick\u2019s credible rape allegation against the president.\n\nIn April of 1978, Broaddrick was a registered nurse who owned a successful nursing home in Van Buren, Arkansas. Broaddrick says, Clinton (who was then the attorney general of Arkansas and running for governor) used the pretext of a busy coffee shop to move their scheduled business meeting to Broaddrick\u2019s hotel room.\n\nIt was there, according to Broaddrick, that Clinton brutally raped her.\n\nAlthough she never reported the rape, there were people she confided in at the time, which is probably how Broaddrick became Jane Doe #5 in Paula Jones\u2019 sexual harassment suit.\n\nJones had claimed she was harassed by then Gov. Clinton in May of 1991, when he exposed himself to her and demanded sex. She had never met him before. Jones said nothing publicly about the incident at the time, but like Broaddrick, was dragged into it. In her specific case, it was a media report where an Arkansas state trooper said that, among other women they procured for Clinton, \u201cPaula told [the trooper] she was available to be Clinton\u2019s regular girlfriend if he so desired.\u201d\n\nJones says she came forward to demand a retraction and to clear her name. From there, she felt it was necessary to tell her story publicly, and after Clinton denied her allegation, she made history by successfully filing a $700,000 suit against a sitting president (he eventually settled for $850,000).\n\nTo back up Jones\u2019 allegation, her attorneys felt it was necessary to document a pattern of Clinton\u2019s behavior, which is how Broaddrick became Jane Doe #5.\n\nNot wanting any part of his, not wanting to relive what she says put her in a state of shock for \u201cmonths,\u201d Broaddrick signed an affidavit in the Jones\u2019 case denying Bill Clinton had made unwanted sexual advances.\n\nIt was around this time that Lisa Myers of NBC News figured out who Jane Doe #5 was, and began to pursue the story.\n\nIn the 2018 docu-series The Clinton Affair, Myers said of Broaddrick\u2019s reluctance to come forward, \u201cWe spoke for almost a year before she actually sat down and did an interview.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI think she just decided that the story was going to come out and she didn\u2019t want other people distorting it, and so she was going to be the one to tell it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Broaddrick, after two decades of not wanting to relive this, what forced her hand was a tabloid report that claimed she had been bought off in exchange for her silence.\n\nAnd so, on January 20, while the Senate was still deciding whether or not to remove Clinton from office, and some 22 days before his acquittal, Broaddrick sat down and taped her interview with Myers for Dateline NBC.\n\nIn The Clinton Affair, Myers explained what happened next\u2026\n\n\u201cWhen I brought back the tapes from Arkansas, there was a great deal of pushback within NBC,\u201d she says, adding this bombshell, \u201cA lot of people just wanted to kill the interview without even looking at it.\u201d\n\nHoping for some help to get the story aired, Myers enlisted the late Tim Russert.\n\n\u201cTim Russert took the tapes home, and he watched it, and he just felt that Juanita was very credible. So basically for the next month, he fought side by side with me to help get it on the air.\u201d\n\nVia email, Broaddrick told Breitbart News what it was like for her as NBC News stalled the story.\n\n\u201cI can remember so many things, like Lisa Myers calling me during the delay and telling me the good news bad news clich\u00e9. She said to me, \u2018Good news is you are credible\u2026 bad news is you are very credible.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course [NBC] purposely held it until after the impeachment vote,\u201d Broaddrick adds.\n\nAt first Broaddrick says she was angry with Myers, and said so, until one of Myers\u2019 colleagues at NBC told her how hard Myers was working to get the story on the air. Broaddrick says she was told by this staffer that \u201c[NBC News President Andrew] Lack and Bill Clinton were friends and even golfed together.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn other words,\u201d she said she was being told, \u201cdon\u2019t plan on it running during impeachment.\u201d\n\nAnd it didn\u2019t. And to her everlasting credit, Myers says she used this time to firm up her reporting.\n\n\u201cJuanita answered every single question we asked,\u201d Myers explains, \u201cShe gave us access to her financial records, her nursing home records [and] history, everything. We did everything possible to scrub her and she was a pretty good sport about it considering how unpleasant it had to be.\u201d\n\nWhat is especially interesting about Myers\u2019 reporting is how the Clinton White House responded \u2014 which was to not respond at all.\n\n\u201c[W]e couldn\u2019t get the Clinton White House to tell us anything,\u201d Myers says. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t tell us where he was that day [of the alleged rape]. They wouldn\u2019t give us any access to his records as attorney general, or his schedule as a gubernatorial candidate\u2026 They gave us nothing.\u201d\n\nEven with all of this, according to Broaddrick, NBC\u2019s hand was only forced after the Wall Street Journal published Dorothy Rabinowitz\u2019s story about Broaddrick on February 19.\n\nIt was \u201cher article which ultimately forced NBC to air it, but conveniently after the [impeachment] vote,\u201d Broaddrick told Breitbart News.\n\nAndrew Lack was president of NBC News during this time, and would remain in that position until 2001.\n\nIn 2015, Lack returned to NBC as the chairman of NBC News and MSNBC, and here we go again\u2026\n\nAlong with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Noah Oppenheim, who is scheduled to take Lack\u2019s job next year after the 72-year-old retires, Lack is currently under fire over allegations of shielding disgraced former Today Show anchor Matt Lauer from a rape allegation, as well as accused-serial predator Harvey Weinstein.\n\nAccording to Ronan Farrow\u2019s book Catch and Kill, Lack (who is also facing allegations of misconduct) and Oppenheim killed his reporting on Weinstein because both executives were friendly with the mogul and wanted to do business with him.\n\nIn their defense, Lack and Oppenheim say Farrow hadn\u2019t nailed down the story, a ridiculous claim when you learn that 1) NBC News ordered him to stop his reporting on Weinstein, 2) Farrow had audio tape from a police sting of Weinstein admitting he groped a model, 3) just a few weeks after NBC sent him down the road, the New Yorker ran the story, and 4) Farrow won a Pulitzer for that story.\n\nFarrow and others also claim Lack covered up for his longtime pal Matt Lauer. As Breitbart News reported earlier:\n\nEven when Lauer was fired in late 2017, NBC tried to protect him (and NBC) by spinning a credible allegation of anal rape into something as innocuous as \u201csexual misconduct.\u201d What\u2019s more, the idea NBC did not know about Lauer\u2019s alleged predations prior to his firing is disputed by a number of on-the-record sources who not only claim they knew about Lauer\u2019s behavior, they complained to management about it.\n\nLack and Oppenheim deny any and all wrongdoing, but adamantly refuse to back that up with an outside, objective investigation \u2014 the kind CBS and Fox News agreed to during their own sexual harassment scandals.\n\nNevertheless, despite what is now an apparent 20 year history and pattern of shielding accused rapists and abusers, there is no serious pressure from the rest of the corporate media for NBC to allow for an outside investigation, and the full Democrat presidential field has still agreed to allow NBC to host their next debate.\n\nBroaddrick (who has written a book about her ordeal), told Breitbart News that NBC\u2019s attempt to kill her story has \u201calways been the most disturbing incident regarding my allegations.\u201d\n\nP.S. The Clinton Affair is worth your time. Broaddrick, Jones, Lewinsky, and Kathleen Willey are interviewed extensively and treated with respect as credible accusers, even as the Rosa Parkses of the #MeToo movement. And other than unforgivably ignoring Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in attempting to personally destroy her husband\u2019s accusers, and glossing over the Clinton White House campaign to discredit Lewinsky as a crazed stalker (until she produced the DNA-stained dress), it is surprisingly even-handed.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
