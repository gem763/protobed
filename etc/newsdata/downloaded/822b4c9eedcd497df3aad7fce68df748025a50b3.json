His new offer would be to distribute the money from his campaign funds \u2014 a move that could run afoul of a Federal Election Commission rule prohibiting the use of campaign money for \u201cpersonal use.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you donate money to a presidential campaign, what happens? The politician spends the money on TV ads and consultants and you hope it works out,\u201d Yang said in his opening statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time to trust ourselves more than our politicians. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to do something unprecedented tonight: My campaign will now give a Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families, someone watching this at home right now.\u201d\n\nAndrew Yang takes the stage at the start of the Democratic presidential debate in Houston on Thursday night.
