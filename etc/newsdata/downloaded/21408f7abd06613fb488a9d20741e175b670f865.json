How often does one see such pseudonyms assigned to potential perps? One associate of Jeffrey Epstein wants the John Doe treatment in an upcoming lawsuit brought by Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre, arguing in a motion filed yesterday that anyone not party to the complaint should not have their reputations besmirched:\n\nJust as one of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s accusers heads to court today to ask a judge to unseal more court documents, a new mystery man is terrified he\u2019ll be named and his reputation will be tarnished. Now, that man is begging for his name to remain a secret, @MorganRadford reports. pic.twitter.com/FNehZr5D9q \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) September 4, 2019\n\nAn anonymous man on Tuesday urged a New York judge to permanently keep secret many of the remaining sealed documents in a defamation lawsuit filed by one of Epstein\u2019s alleged victims, Virginia Giuffre, against the late money manager\u2019s confidante, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. \u2026 Hundreds of pages of sealed documents in the 2015 case were already made public by an appeals court on Aug. 9, revealing for the first time unsubstantiated claims that Epstein had sent Giuffre to have sex with well-known people when she was a girl, including former U.S. Senator George Mitchell and asset manager Glenn Dubin. The men denied the allegations. Now, two subsets of additional sealed documents are due to be analyzed by a judge who\u2019ll decide if they should also be made public. Doe said he hadn\u2019t been notified that his name appears in the sealed documents. A hearing on the matter is set for Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan. \u201cAs a non-party to these proceedings, Doe lacks specific knowledge about the contents of the sealed materials,\u201d his lawyers wrote. \u201cBut it is clear that these materials implicate the privacy and reputational interests of many persons other than the two primary parties to this action, Giuffre and Maxwell.\u201d\n\nHow serious is the threat? Giuffre attorney David Boies says it\u2019s pretty darned serious, and the motion itself quotes a judge\u2019s description of the material:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole new set of documents, five to 10 times larger in volume than what has been released so far,\u201d the lawyer said, referring to nearly 2,000 pages of case documents that were made public on Aug. 9 \u2014 just a day before Epstein\u2019s death by suicide at a lower Manhattan jail. Bois said the still-sealed tranche contains depositions from never-before-heard witnesses, but declined to provide any names. \u2026 The letter goes on to say a prior judge overseeing the case summarized the still-secret documents as containing a \u201crange of allegations of sexual acts involving Plaintiff and non-parties to this litigation, some famous, some not; the identities of non-parties who either allegedly engaged in sexual acts with Plaintiff or who allegedly facilitated such acts.\u201d Doe\u2019s lawyers do not say in the papers if he is famous, or what accusations he expects to face in the court papers. His attorneys did not immediately return a message.\n\nSounds interesting, no? It certainly doesn\u2019t sound sympathetic, however. Those who partied with Epstein may or may not have known about his predilection for underage girls, but they had to know that they were running some kind of risk. Perhaps they fell under the spell of Epstein\u2019s arrogance of untouchability; if so, the spell has been broken big time. And Epstein\u2019s victims deserve the full measure of justice they can still get after Epstein decided to take the coward\u2019s way out. This John Doe is most decidedly not among the victims, even if he may not be among the explicit perps in this case.\n\nStill, a judge might see this as a question of fairness. If Giuffre and other Epstein victims want to put names in the record, they should make those men party to the case by suing them as well. If they cannot sustain a lawsuit against them, then a judge might see no choice but to assign them pseudonyms in order to allow the documents and testimony to be admitted into evidence.\n\nThat may not save John Doe anyway. Nothing prevents the victims from telling their stories in public, as Giuffre has already begun to do. If she names names, the only recourse John Doe would have would be to sue her for defamation \u2014 and open himself up to discovery, cross-examination, and potential impeachment by cooperating witnesses. Even if Doe gets the relief he seeks today, it\u2019s not likely to last long unless he reaches a settlement with the victims.
