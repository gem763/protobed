REUTERS/Ammar Awad\n\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - A massive, new underground necropolis is being built in Jerusalem to help overcome a looming shortage of gravesites for Jewish people in the holy city.\n\nThe mile-long labyrinth, with 23,000 burial chambers lining the walls and ground, was tunnelled into the hillside beneath Jerusalem\u2019s main Jewish cemetery, Givat Shaul, which is quickly running out of space.\n\nChevra Kadisha, the main group overseeing Jewish burials in Israel, has invested some 300 million shekels ($86 million) in the modern twist on an ancient burial practice that it hopes will ease the pressure on the city\u2019s cemeteries.\n\nDozens of graveyards in Israel have already closed their gates to new burials. Non-Jews, who make up a minority in Israel, are buried in separate cemeteries.\n\nThe first 8,000 graves will be ready to use at the end of the month.\n\n\u201cAccording to our plan, after we finish the first part of 23,000 graves, probably we will have enough space to continue digging underground,\u201d Chananya Shachor, director of a local chapter of Chevra Kadisha, said on Sunday as the media got a first glimpse of the work.\n\n\u201cWe will continue if people will accept this new method of burying.\u201d\n\n($1 = 3.4802 shekels)", "description": "A massive, new underground necropolis is being built in Jerusalem to help overcome a looming shortage of gravesites for Jewish people in the holy city.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437902229&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9602D", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
