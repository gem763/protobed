The agency violated both the law that authorized the surveillance program they used and the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution.\n\nThe ruling was made in October 2018 by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), a secret government court responsible for reviewing and authorizing searches of foreign individuals inside and outside the US. It was just made public today.\n\nThe FBI made unauthorized, warrantless electronic searches on American citizens\n\nThe program itself, called Section 702 and part of the broad and aggressive expansion of US spy programs in the years after 9/11, granted FBI agents the ability to search a database of electronic intelligence, including phone numbers, emails, and other identifying data. It\u2019s intended for use primarily by the National Security Agency.\n\nThere\u2019s a key limitation on Section 702: it can only be used to search for evidence of a crime or as part of an investigation into a foreign target. The idea is to monitor terrorism suspects and cyberthreats.\n\nYet the FBI vetted American sources using the database, according to The Wall Street Journal. The agents also used the database to search for information about themselves. Less amusingly, they also looked up friends, family, and coworkers. The court deemed this a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable search and seizure, because none of the searches of US citizens had proper warrants attached.\n\nThe FISC is responsible for evaluating the use of these spy tools in secret as part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, which pushed these governmental deliberations behind closed doors under the guise of protecting national security. That\u2019s why this ruling went a full year before seeing the light of day.\n\nIt\u2019s public now because the government lost an appeal in a separate, secret appeals court, the WSJ says. The FBI must now create new oversight procedures and a compliance review team to protect against further surveillance abuse.", "description": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation was found last year to have violated Americans\u2019 privacy rights by misusing an electronic surveillance database in violation of both the law that authorized the surveillance program and the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution.", "authors": ["Nick Statt", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ec09iymDZZtLyMew7HpVc02Kec0=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8726989/acastro_170621_1777_0003_fin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
