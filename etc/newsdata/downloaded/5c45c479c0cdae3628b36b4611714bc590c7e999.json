Trump's legal counsel to deal with the Democrats' impeachment inquiry into the president's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from this past July. Democrats assert that President Trump offered a quid pro quo to Ukraine, offering military aid in exchange for investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings.\n\nAn administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the AP on Tuesday night that Gowdy has agreed to join the Trump legal team. Earlier reports stated that Gowdy had rejected an offer, but further reporting verified this was not true.\n\nThe story comes as President Trump sent Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi an eight page letter explaining why the White House will not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. Matt covered the pertinent details Tuesday night:\n\nThe letter is eight pages and outlines why this impeachment inquiry is a total circus. House Democrats executed this impeachment push based off of a July phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where it was alleged in a whistleblower report that Trump had threatened to withhold military aid unless Zelensky opened a corruption probe into Hunter Biden. The transcript refuted all of that; there is no quid pro quo. The report is based on second-hand accounts. This person, who is reportedly a CIA agent and registered Democrat, never listened in on the call. They also worked with a 2020 candidate. Need I say more about the shoddiness of this attempt? It\u2019s a witch hunt that is fueled by Trump Derangement Syndrome of the most extreme sort.\n\nAs Matt said, \"It\u2019s a kangaroo court, which this White House has zero time to entertain.\" It would make sense then that they hired a no bull former federal prosecutor who will not let Democrats pull any of the kinds of shenanigans we've seen during this bogus inquiry so far.", "description": ".10/09/2019 14:33:00PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/354/ac875636-86da-4131-a45d-9c5a9335c248.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
