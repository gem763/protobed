(Thomas Peter/Reuters)\n\nIf Hong Kong teenagers and cartoon characters are all there is between us and an authoritarian regime, we are in big trouble.\n\nKarl Marx once said, \u201cThe last capitalist we hang shall be the one who sold us the rope.\u201d While everything else he said was a load of crap, corporate America\u2019s recent disgusting behavior seems to prove Marx might be right on this one.\n\nEarly last week, we learned Apple pulled a popular app, HK Map Live, from the App Store. Hong Kong protesters have been relying on this app to track police activity on the streets of Hong Kong and to avoid trouble spots. The app also helps bystanders plan their routes to their daily lives without getting caught up in increasingly violent confrontations between the police and protesters. Given the fact that Hong Kong police shot an 18-year-old protester on October 1, China\u2019s National Day, this app could be life-saving for many.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet Apple decided to pull the app right after one of the bloodiest clashes between the Hong Kong police and protestors. The company informed the app developer that \u201cYour app contains content \u2014 or facilitates, enables, and encourages an activity \u2014 that is not legal. . . . Specifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe this is the same Apple whose most iconic ad was a rebel throwing a hammer at the image of a \u201cBig Brother,\u201d or the same company that fought against the FBI\u2019s request to build a backdoor access to an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino terrorists.\n\nAfter igniting widespread outcry, Apple revised its decision and brought the HK Map Live app back a day later. But this wasn\u2019t the first time and certainly won\u2019t be the last time Apple capitulates to the Chinese authoritarian regime. Apple is too far down this path: It agreed to China\u2019s security checks, moved local user data onto China-based servers, and disabled a news app to appease Chinese censors. Apple CEO Tim Cook talks up privacy, consumer rights, and democracy in the U.S. when it is safe to take a high moral ground, but he seems to see nothing immoral in aiding Apple\u2019s anti-democracy master in China all for profit and market access.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple isn\u2019t alone in trading morality for money. It has plenty of company. Last Friday, right after the Apple reversal, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey wrote a simple tweet showing support for Hong Kong protesters, \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d His simple tweet drew criticism from the Chinese Consulate in Houston and the Chinese Basketball Association chaired by Yao Ming, who earned fame and fortune by playing for the Rockets. A number of Chinese companies cut economic ties with the Rockets immediately.\n\nSeeing fading dollar signs, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta quickly and publicly rebuked Morey for his tweet. Morey speedily apologized, and some speculated it was because his job was on the line. Then the NBA issued its own apology/statements in Chinese and English, with the Chinese version worded much more harshly than the English one, saying it is \u201cextremely disappointed in Morey\u2019s inappropriate statement.\u201d Since when has expressing support for democracy been inappropriate?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile bullying from the Chinese side shouldn\u2019t be surprising, the actions taken and words spoken by the Rockets\u2019 owner and the NBA are simply shameful. The NBA is one of the least diverse organizations in corporate America. Others have pointed out that the NBA remained silent (as it should ) and showed little concern over the feelings of American fans when some coaches and a number of players were critical of President Trump and his supporters. But the league has no problem sucking up to an actual brutal regime that has put more than a million Muslims in internment camps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy making such a shameful statement, the NBA did something unthinkable nowadays: It united Republicans and Democrats in this highly polarized political environment. Republican senators Ben Sasse, Ted Cruz, and Tim Scott, as well as Democratic senator Chuck Schumer and a couple of Democratic congressmen all issued statements criticizing the NBA for not supporting pro-democracy Hong Kongers and letting Americans be bullied by a Communist regime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as a China watcher tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s not about the NBA. It\u2019s about all the other foreign companies with significant investments in China who are right now sending out frantic company-wide emails to make sure no one posts supporting Hong Kong.\u201d So there you go. China doesn\u2019t even have to waste any money setting up covert operations in the U.S. to influence Americans. Corporate America is doing China\u2019s bidding voluntarily. They don\u2019t want to upset Chinese authorities and end up losing access to the supposedly lucrative great China market.\n\nAmericans should have seen this coming. Last year, Marriott fired an hourly employee in Omaha for liking a tweet posted by a Tibetan group. Google chose not to help American soldiers by declining to do artificial-intelligence work with the Department of Defense, but it was eager to provide a censored version of its search engine in China. In addition, Google joined IBM to fund an organization that \u201cis working with a company that is helping China\u2019s authoritarian government conduct mass surveillance against its citizens,\u201d according to The Intercept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCorporate America bent its knee for the obvious profit motive, but what it is doing is dangerous.\n\nThese corporations put their own long-term survival in danger. Let\u2019s take a look at Apple. Its capitulations to Chinese authorities paid off, initially. For a few quarters, sales in China accounted for more than half of the company\u2019s growth. But then the Chinese government shut down the iBooks Store and iTunes Movies and rejected Apple\u2019s right to trademark the name \u201ciPhone\u201d in China. In the meantime, the Chinese government threw its resources behind supporting domestic brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi to compete against Apple. Apple has been losing market share and sales in China. As of the first quarter of 2019, Apple\u2019s iPhone sales in China were down 30 percent , and market share in China was only 7.4 percent, down from 10.2 percent last year. Karl Marx may be right after all, that corporations such as Apple are selling the ropes to a Communist regime that is ready to hang them.\n\nBut worse yet, what these companies did and are still doing is put freedom-loving people in China in danger by enabling the Chinese government to easily track, identitfy, and arrest dissidents. These organizations also put our own democracy in danger by suppressing freedom of expression of our own citizens. What\u2019s the future of our republic if Americans have to check with China first before they say anything in their own homeland?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, not everyone gives a damn of what may offend Chinese authorities. This week, Chinese censors quickly deleted every clip, episode, and online discussion of South Park from Chinese internets after the most recent episode criticized Hollywood\u2019s sucking up to Chinese censors. The creators of South Park \u201capologized\u201d in typical South Park style, by mocking Chinese censors even more. Good for them. But if Hong Kong teenagers and cartoon characters are all there is between us and an authoritarian regime that is bent on imposing control on all of us, we are in big trouble.\n\nSomething to Consider If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.
