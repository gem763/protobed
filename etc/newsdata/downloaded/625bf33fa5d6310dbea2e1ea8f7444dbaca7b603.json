Pictured is Roger Jenkins, 64, seen in January outside Southwark Crown Court\n\nThose investors who provided funding include Qatar Holdings, an arm of the Gulf state's sovereign wealth fund.\n\nOpening the case today, prosecutor Edward Brown QC said the defendants agreed that lies should be told to the market to ensure that vital investments into Barclays were secured amid the global banking crisis.\n\nHe said: 'The lies that they told concerned the true terms of two very large investments being made into the bank by the Qataris.\n\n'At the time of crisis in 2008, Barclays turned to Qatar to secure investment that was fundamental to its future.\n\n'In this case, the price agreed and then paid by Barclays to Qatar for investing was considerably higher than that paid to other investors for their investment into Barclays.'\n\nMr Brown said that paying one investor more than another went against established banking practice and would not have been accepted by the other investors.\n\nHe said the defendants faced a 'dilemma' - insist on paying Qatar no more in commission fees that it was paying to others and risk failing to get the vital investment, or agree to pay more commission without telling the other investors and to find a dishonest way to hide that fact.\n\nMr Brown told jurors: 'These defendants, a small cadre of very senior executives, and another - a director at the bank - agreed to pursue the second option.\n\n'The Qatari investment had to be achieved and this meant telling lies.'\n\nBankers Roger Jenkins, 64, Tom Kalaris (left in January outside Southwark Crown Court), 63, and Richard Boath, 60, (right outside same court) raised \u00a3322million in emergency fundraising from two Qatari investors amid worldwide financial chaos, jurors were told\n\nThe defendants allegedly knew that details of the investments would be published in public documents.\n\nMr Brown said It was a fundamental rule of good banking practice that these documents tell the truth so that all investors know the terms on which they are investing and that shareholders know the true position.\n\nHe alleged the defendants knew these documents contained lies about the true position in relation to the Qataris, making it a criminal offence.\n\nThe prosecutor said: 'They acted dishonestly in order to preserve the future of the bank and to preserve their own positions.\n\n'These defendants were intelligent and highly placed bankers. Together they devised a mechanism, a pretend agreement, which was an attempt to disguise the additional payments that they were making to the Qataris.\n\n'In short, they pretended that the additional commission fees that they were paying to the Qataris for their, the Qatari, investments were actually fees for a separate, commercially valuable, genuine 'Advisory Services Agreements'.\n\n'The prosecution alleges that these agreements were an invention, used as a means to hide the additional fees that were in truth being paid to the Qataris for investing.\n\n'It was into two 'Advisory Services Agreements' that the defendants put what were in truth fees for investing and they were party to the claim that the Qataris were paid what everyone else was.'\n\nJenkins, of Malibu, California, Kalaris, of Knightsbridge, and Boath, of Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, deny two charges of fraud by false representation, between 1 May 2008 and 31 August 2008.\n\nThe charge alleges they conspired together 'to commit fraud by making a false representation, namely within documents relating to Barclays' capital raising of June 2008, intending to make a gain, namely or cause loss to another, or exposing another to a risk of loss.'\n\nJenkins also denies two like charges of fraud by false representation, between 1 September 2008 and 30 November 2008.\n\nThe charge alleges he conspired together 'to commit fraud by making a false representation, namely within documents relating to Barclays' capital raising of October 2008, intending to make a gain, namely or cause loss to another, or exposing another to a risk of loss'.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Bankers Roger Jenkins, 64, (pictured) Tom Kalaris, 63, and Richard Boath, 60, raised \u00a3322million in emergency fundraising from two Qatari investors in 2008, jurors at the Old Bailey were told today.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/16/19449862-0-image-a-61_1570549668118.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
