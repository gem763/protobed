God, it\u2019s boring isn\u2019t it. When are we going to have fun again? When will the good times start rolling?\n\nIn amongst the political mire of Brexit last week came the news that Bonmarche had gone into administration. To be quite honest this news felt like old news: how could Bonmarche survive if Debenhams couldn\u2019t?\n\nThe news didn\u2019t affect me emotionally in the same way the Pizza Express wobble did just a few weeks ago, after all, I don\u2019t have a gutful of Bonmarche memories, in fact I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been in one, which, before you jump to conclusions doesn\u2019t mean to say I don\u2019t feel appalled on behalf of their staff.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHowever, somewhere I have mooched around for years, usually not buying, but happily looking, touching, wishing and wanting is the Conran Shop and now that\u2019s having a precarious moment too, with Sir Terence bringing in advisers to find a new financial partner as the business battles today\u2019s choppy retail waters.\n\nAt the risk of sounding hysterical, losing the Conran Shop would break my heart. The old man used to take me there when we were dating back in the mid-80s; I thought he was trying to tell me he was gay, but then I realised he just loved furniture and he still does. Lots of men drool over motorbikes and fast cars and so does Geof, but he will also get palpitations looking at a really beautifully designed sofa and I can lose him for hours in the lighting department.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

AFP/Getty\n\nSome couples like to spend their leisure time going for long country yomps or hiking up mountains; the \u00c9clair-Powells like a nice mosey round the Conran Shop.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I love nature, I love popping outdoors to see how the ivy is doing and how many conkers I can find, but I also love looking at cushions and vases, and one does not preclude the other.\n\nMy preferred store is the original on Fulham Road, \u201cMichelin House\u201d, the handsome old tyre depot with its stained glass windows and circa-1911 decorative tiles depicting racing cars. It\u2019s the one with the flower stall outside and the snazzy sea-food restaurant where well-heeled folk eat shellfish from those tiered silver cake stands. I\u2019ve never eaten there. It remains a dream: my partner might be a fan of Sir Terence\u2019s wares but he just doesn\u2019t share my prawn cravings.\n\nA lot of people will accuse the Conran Shop of being elitist, and maybe it is? But people will always want beautiful things and it\u2019s not offensively expensive \u2013 you can pop in and buy an elaborately wrapped soap or a very nice jar of pickled onions in balsamic vinegar for under a tenner, and sometimes the little treats are the ones that mean the most. Plus, their staff members are the nicest in London.\n\nOver the years, any flush times chez \u00c9clair-Powell have been celebrated with much prized Conran items. There have been watches and leather goods, a certain shelving unit and the odd desk. We even bought Conran Christmas crackers when things were particularly buoyant and yes they always cracked properly and the hats didn\u2019t instantly rip, (not that I want to wear a paper Christmas hat for months on end, I\u2019m not mad). What I\u2019m trying to say is that now and again, a bit of luxury when you can afford it is a lovely thing, otherwise you are just working to pay taxes, and how dull is that? Life can\u2019t be all stick and no carrot.\n\nPersonally I like looking round the house and remembering how we bought a certain cushion or a particularly nice lamp because Geof had completed a difficult job or I\u2019d managed to finish writing a book.\n\nMost of us have been driven online by cost and convenience and who can blame us? The Conran Shop is one of the few places I still enjoy visiting in person. For starters, it\u2019s not a clothes shop, and the joy of buying something for the house is that I don\u2019t have to stand in a changing room trying not to cry. Yes these linen napkins will need ironing, but look at the pretty colours and I can never grow out of a napkin.\n\nIn all honesty, anything we\u2019ve ever bought from Conran is still giving us good value. His stuff is built to last, the chair in the sitting room may need recovering but only because it\u2019s so comfortable that I\u2019ve almost worn through the fabric, light bulbs may need changing but the lamp still works and that 20-year-old vase is still going strong, it\u2019s only the flowers that go off.\n\nI have huge respect for all the work Terence Conran has done over the years. It\u2019s mostly thanks to him that we give our homes some of the love they deserve. Fingers crossed his wonderful stores live on, because the idea of the Conran Shop being yet another retail casualty is unbearably sad.", "description": "And so we continue to live in troubled times.
