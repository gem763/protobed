Economists forecast a 1.6% gain.\n\nThe report comes ahead of an anticipated cut in interest rates by Federal Reserve later Wednesday, the third decrease in three months in a campaign to ward off a possible recession. The risk of a downturn has eased somewhat in recent weeks after the U.S. and China agreed to a tentative truce in their trade war that likely suspends future tariffs on Chinese imports but leaves existing duties in place.\n\nAlso, the risk of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d that doesn\u2019t include trade agreements between Britain and Europe has ebbed. And long-term Treasury bond yields have edged back above short-term rates, reversing a so-called \u201cinverted yield curve\u201d that had signaled a bleak outlook.\n\nBut the trade fight is still dampening business confidence and investment, compounding the effects of a sluggish global economy that has hurt U.S. manufacturing. And the lift to the economy from federal tax cuts and spending increases spearheaded by President Trump increases is fading. Wells Fargo predicts the economy will grow 1.5% the second half of the year, down from about 2.5% the first half, and 1.7% in the first half of 2020.\n\nMany economists still foresee an elevated risk of recession next year as Trump heads into a presidential election in November.\n\nConsumer spending rises\n\nConsumer spending grew a solid 2.9% in the third quarter, below the blistering 4.6% pace in the second quarter. Consumers generally have shrugged off the trade standoff, which has started to increase retail prices.\n\nJob growth has slowed but the unemployment rate dropped to a new 50-year low of 3.5% in September and wages have been rising about 3% annually, putting more money in shoppers\u2019 pockets. The stock market, while volatile, has notched record highs recently.\n\nConsumption makes up about 70% of economic activity.\n\nConsumer confidence has slipped in recent months amid the trade battle and slowing global growth and retail sales fell last month.\n\n\u201cCracks are beginning to materialize in the consumer, the bedrock of the U.S. economy,\u201d Wells Fargo wrote in a research note before Wednesday\u2019s report.\n\nBusiness investment declines\n\nBusiness investment fell 3% after dropping 1% in the second quarter. Outlays on structures fell 15.3%, partly because of a pullback in oil drilling amid lower prices, while spending on equipment dropped 3.8%.\n\nThe trade war has increased the price of many Chinese imports, including factory parts and retail products, squeezing manufacturers and retailers. The impasse, along with feeble growth overseas, also has curtailed U.S. exports. The trade battle also has generated uncertainty, prompting companies to hold off on new projects.\n\nTwo temporary factors \u2013 the grounding of Boeing 737 Max jets in the wake of two crashes and the now-settled General Motors strike -- also played roles in the slowdown, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander.\n\nResidential investment bounces back\n\nConstruction of new single-family homes and apartments, along with renovations, rose 5.1%, breaking a streak of six consecutive quarterly declines. Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates have fallen to 3.75% from 4.86% a year ago, juicing home purchases and construction. That has helped offset a shortage of labor and available lots has constrained builders.\n\nGovernment outlays increase\n\nFederal, state and local spending increased 2%, down from a 4.8% rise in the second quarter. Federal outlays rose 3.4% while state and local edged up 1.1%. The $300 billion in additional federal spending approved by Congress in early 2018 continued to boost the economy but the stimulus is expected to lose steam by late this year.\n\nTrade is a drag on growth\n\nU.S. exports rose 0.7%, following a 5.7% drop in the second quarter. Trump\u2019s tariffs on $360 billion in Chinese imports have sparked counter-tariffs by China that have curtailed shipments of soybeans, vegetables and other products. Meanwhile, imports increased 1.2%. As a result, trade overall subtracted a slight 0.08 percentage points from growth.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWhile economic output increased faster than expected last quarter, growth has slowed from a 3% yearly clip though the first nine months of 2018 to 2% over the past year, roughly in line with the tepid pace that has marked the record 10-year-old expansion. Federal tax cuts and spending increases helped deliver the 3% gain Trump promised but that stimulus is now fading.\n\nIan Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics expects the economy to grow just 1% in the fourth quarter as the trade war and weak business investment take a bigger toll.\n\n\"Largely thanks to the consumer, the U.S. economy turned out a better-than-expected performance,\" says economist Leslie Preston of TD Economics. \"That said, it doesn't change the narrative\" of a slowing economy.\n\nThis was Commerce\u2019s first estimate of third quarter GDP growth. It will publish two revised estimates coming weeks.", "description": "The U.S. economy grew 1.9% in the third quarter as weak business investment persisted while consumer spending pulled back", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/19fe0dfc11be833a43d8762262add1923690cc2a/c=0-296-5674-3488/local/-/media/2019/10/15/USATODAY/usatsports/MotleyFool-TMOT-a924dc08-clothes-shopping.jpg?width=3200&height=1801&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
