There was less stress.\"\n\nThis story originally appeared in The Sun.", "description": "An ancient asteroid collision may have filled the atmosphere with enough dust to trigger an ice age, scientists claim.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/asteroid-earth-NO-REUSE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
