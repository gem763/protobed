Her meeting with Democratic leaders began at 4 p.m. ET and is ongoing as I write this. Are they forming a select committee on impeachment or letting Nadler run the show? Are they focusing exclusively on the Ukraine matter or planning to kitchen-sink Trump with obstruction material from Russiagate? What precisely will they say in the resolution they\u2019re planning to introduce tomorrow addressing the Ukraine matter?\n\nIt\u2019s all up in the air. Stay close to a computer or TV for the next hour.\n\nShe spoke about impeachment briefly an event earlier today and sounded ready to proceed, after nearly a year of fending off progressive demands.\n\nPressed on her caucus' rapidly increasing support for impeachment, Speaker Nancy Pelosi says, \"We have to have the facts. That's why I've said, as soon as we have the facts, we're ready. Now we have the facts. We're ready\u2014for later today.\" https://t.co/HGpxYYAf1w pic.twitter.com/WBp3sxlWux \u2014 Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) September 24, 2019\n\nWhile we wait for her, there\u2019s some new bad news for the president. Obviously, Trump wants a clean \u201cDemocrats vs. Republicans\u201d narrative for the big impeachment war. The more unified Republicans are, the easier it is for him to dismiss objections to what he said to Zelensky as mindless partisan harassment by the left. There\u2019s a potential complicating factor in the Senate, though \u2014 Richard Burr\u2019s Republican-led Intel Committee is now opening a probe into the Ukraine matter. Nothing\u2019s going to convince 20 Senate Republicans to join with Democrats on a post-impeachment vote to remove Trump, but if Burr\u2019s committee were to accuse Trump of misconduct it\u2019d be a PR coup for Democrats. This isn\u2019t partisanship, they could say. Even a Senate panel led by the GOP concluded that there was wrongdoing here.\n\nA letter seeking to question the still-anonymous whistleblower was sent Tuesday to Andrew Bakaj, the lawyer who represents the official. It was signed by committee chair Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. \u2014 signifying that the panel is pursuing the politically explosive issue on a bipartisan basis. \u201cIn order to ascertain the appropriate path forward for your client while protecting your client\u2019s privacy, we are writing to request that you make your client available for a closed bipartisan interview with Committee counsel no later than Friday, September 27, 2019, in a mutually agreeable secure location,\u201d the letter reads\u2026 The committee\u2019s request for an interview increases pressure on the Trump White House over an issue that seems increasingly likely to trigger a formal impeachment inquiry in the House. The fact that Burr has joined the request for more information immediately sends a signal that even some Senate Republicans \u2014 until now, almost all loyal to Trump \u2014 acknowledge the need for more information about the explosive allegations that Trump improperly pressured Ukraine to do his bidding in an attempt to smear his potential Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nEven more dangerous for Trump is the fact that Burr said in 2016 when he won his third term to the Senate that he wouldn\u2019t seek a fourth term in 2022. Trump has no leverage over him, in other words, by threatening a primary challenge. And Burr earned a reputation in the media as a square dealer for conducting the Senate Intel Committee\u2019s Russiagate probe in a bipartisan way, in dramatic contrast to the knife fighting that went on between Devin Nunes and Adam Schiff on the House side. If Burr\u2019s committee meets with the whistleblower and finds him or her credible and the allegations serious, that\u2019s a bad spot for Trump to be in.\n\nAnother not great sign for Trump today is McConnell declining to cover for him on the mysterious delay in sending Ukraine the military aid that Congress appropriated for it:\n\nMcConnell said he spoke to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo twice about the matter without receiving clarification for the delay in $391 million in aid to Ukraine. \u201cI was very actively involved in advocating [for] the aid. I talked to the secretary of Defense, the secretary of State once,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news was it finally happened,\u201d he added, noting the administration finally released the aid. \u201cI have no idea what precipitated the delay.\u201d\n\nOver to you, Mr. President. We\u2019re about 30 minutes away from Pelosi as I write this but news is already leaking out of the closed-door Dem leadership meeting. I\u2019ll leave you with this while we await her presser. Stand by for updates.\n\nPELOSI in the closed dem caucus meeting: this is a \u201cmoment of truth\u201d \u2014 Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) September 24, 2019\n\nPelosi has told democrats they\u2019re moving to impeach the president. \u2014 Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) September 24, 2019\n\nPELOSI addressing the caucus right now behind closed doors: \u201cHe is asking a foreign government to help him in his campaign, that is a betrayal of his oath of office.\u201d \u2014 Heather Caygle (@heatherscope) September 24, 2019\n\nUpdate: There may already be an answer to the question of whether there\u2019ll be a select committee or not. It sounds like \u201cnot.\u201d Nadler\u2019s committee will remain in charge.\n\n2 Dem sources are saying Pelosi has asked the the 6 cmte chairs (nto put together their best cases on impeachment & send that to Judiciary. Judiciary would package together & decide whether to send to the full House articles of impeachment. \u2014 John Bresnahan (@BresPolitico) September 24, 2019\n\nUpdate: More pressure on Trump from Republicans:\n\nThe Senate has *unanimously* agreed to Schumer's resolution calling for the whistleblower complaint to be turned over the intelligence committees immediately. \u2014 Steven Dennis (@StevenTDennis) September 24, 2019\n\nThey\u2019re not turning on him. But if they\u2019re going to be forced by Pelosi to take a nightmarish vote on whether to remove the president from office, they want to know \u2014 and they want the public to know \u2014 precisely what the complaint is. Republicans are hoping that the material is thin and that its thinness will make it easy (or easier) to vote no on removal. And in the meantime, making a few gestures of concern about what Trump is accused of while provide them a little distance from him as this plays out. Unquestionably they\u2019re going to circle the wagons around them, but whatever they can do to create a veneer of independence from him is worth doing.\n\nUpdate: As expected, Pelosi announces that a formal impeachment inquiry has begun.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 PELOSI: \u201cToday I am announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.\u201d \ud83d\udea8 \u2014 Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) September 24, 2019\n\nNadler has already insisted that he\u2019s overseeing an impeachment inquiry but Democrats have tried to be cute about that, sometimes contradicting him in the belief that voters would react badly to impeachment. That caution is now out the window. Which, by the way, may strengthen Democrats\u2019 hand in court when they seek documents from Trump and he asserts executive privilege. Because impeachment is a constitutional function expressly delegated to the House, judges might be more inclined to side with Dems in forcing Trump to turn over evidence despite his privilege claim.\n\nUpdate: The tweeter-in-chief has logged on.\n\nSuch an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nPelosi, Nadler, Schiff and, of course, Maxine Waters! Can you believe this? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nThey never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nUpdate: Here\u2019s Pelosi\u2019s full statement. Democrats are reportedly asking each other this afternoon whether anything has actually changed here. Like I said, Nadler has been insisting all along that he\u2019s running an impeachment inquiry. It\u2019s noteworthy, obviously, that the impeachment-skeptic Speaker has now embraced the idea but as a formal matter nothing is different. As a practical matter, with Pelosi having endorsed the inquiry on national television, they\u2019re now probably committed to impeaching Trump eventually. Imagine them telling their base after all this, \u201cNah, there\u2019s just not enough there.\u201d\n\nUpdate: Some Dems continue to think the Speaker is too cautious\u2026\n\nPelosi speaking. Meanwhile some Dems are not happy about what they heard and are speaking out in the caucus. \u201cIf you are asking us to stay on message, give us a goddamn message to stay on,\u201d Rep. Slotkin said. \u2014 Heather Caygle (@heatherscope) September 24, 2019\n\nUpdate: Democrats who were wondering what the point of today\u2019s spectacle was now have their answer, per Politico: Under pressure of impeachment, the White House is now reportedly preparing to release the whistleblower complaint to Congress.\n\nThe White House is preparing to release to Congress by the end of the week both the whistleblower complaint and the Inspector General report that are at the center of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, according to a senior administration official, reversing its position after withholding the documents from lawmakers. The move shows the level of seriousness with which the administration is now approaching the House\u2018s new impeachment proceedings, even as President Donald Trump publicly tries to minimize the inquiry as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d or \u201cpresidential harassment,\u201d or a move that will help him win his 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nPelosi called Trump\u2019s bluff, now he\u2019s calling hers. Here\u2019s the material; are you really going to pull the trigger on impeachment?", "description": "Turning point.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/p-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
