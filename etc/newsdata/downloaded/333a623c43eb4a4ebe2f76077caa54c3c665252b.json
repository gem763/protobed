Overall, the analysis suggests, we\u2019ve seen a 29% decline.\n\n\u201cWe expected to see continuing declines of threatened species. But for the first time, the results also showed pervasive losses among common birds across all habitats, including backyard birds,\u201d Kenneth Rosenberg, the lead author of the study, said in a press release.\n\nRosenberg, a scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and American Bird Conservancy, told Business Insider that entire bird species aren\u2019t going extinct yet, but the animals\u2019 total population numbers are taking a hard hit.\n\n\u201cWe make the analogy to the passenger pigeon \u2013 once one of the most numerous birds on the planet,\u201d he said of his team\u2019s paper. \u201cNo one thought that bird could go extinct, but it did. It provides a poignant reminder that even abundant species can go extinct rapidly.\u201d\n\nThe bird losses described in the study are part of a larger trend: The Earth appears to be in the middle of a mass extinction \u2013 the sixth time in history that animal and plant species are disappearing in enormous numbers. A recent report from the United Nations found that between 500,000 and 1 million plant and animals species face imminent extinction.\n\nRosenberg said the new findings are \u201cabsolutely part of the sixth mass extinction trend.\u201d\n\nCommon bird species were among the hardest hit\n\nFor the new study, Rosenberg and his colleagues looked at data sets showing net changes in the numbers of birds across 529 species in the continental United States and Canada. They also examined weather radar data that tracked bird migration patterns over the past decade.\n\nThey found that 90% of the birds that are disappearing belong to 12 families, including sparrows, warblers, finches, and swallows. These common and abundant species play important ecological roles \u2013 they help control insect population numbers and spread plant seeds.\n\nGrassland birds like sparrows and meadowlarks experienced the greatest total population loss since 1970, according to the data. More than 700 million breeding birds disappeared across 31 grassland species. The report also found 37% of shorebird species \u2013 like sandpipers and plovers \u2013 have experienced a consistent, steep population loss.\n\ncaption A small, wading Sanderling. source Andy Eckerson, Macaulay Library at Cornell Lab of Ornithology\n\nThe number of North American birds migrating in the spring has also declined, dropping 14% in the past decade alone, the researchers found.\n\nMichael Parr, a co-author of the study and the president of the American Bird Conservancy, told Business Insider that the overall bird loss represents a biodiversity crisis on par with the \u201cinsect apocalypse.\u201d According to a study published in February, 40% of the world\u2019s insect species are in decline.\n\nRead More: Last year, 40% of honey-bee colonies in the US died. But bees aren\u2019t the only insects disappearing in unprecedented numbers.\n\n\u201cThe global biodiversity crisis has come to America\u2019s backyard here. When people picture losses, they think orangutans and elephants \u2013 creatures that aren\u2019t here,\u201d Parr said. \u201cSure, this is not as dramatic as the potential loss of the Bald Eagle, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s more insidious. Most people won\u2019t notice that most of their backyard birds have gone, slowly but surely, over the last 50-year period.\u201d\n\nHowever, the authors found a few bird groups that have seen population increases over the last five decades, including waterfowl like ducks, geese, and swans, as well as raptors like the Bald Eagle. These particular birds have benefited from endangered-species legislation in the US and Canada and from wetland restoration work across the continent, the researchers said.\n\nShrinking bird populations are a sign of the 6th mass extinction\n\nSince the 1500s, human activity has killed off 680 mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, and fish species. As much as half of the total number of animal individuals that once shared the planet with us are already gone.\n\nAt least 10% of insect species and more than 33% of all marine mammals and reef-forming coral are threatened, the UN report found.\n\nDeclines in common birds are not just restricted to North America, Rosenberg said: \u201cWhen you step back, it\u2019s really a global phenomenon.\u201d\n\nA 2018 study revealed that one-third of France\u2019s farmland bird populations had disappeared in the previous three decades. Data from Bird Life International, a global partnership of bird-conservation organizations, shows that Europe as a whole has lost 300 million farmland birds since 1980.\n\ncaption A Baltimore oriole. source Ryan Schain, Macaulay Library at Cornell Lab of Ornithology\n\n\u201cBirds are literally the canaries in the coal mine,\u201d Parr said. \u201cTheir disappearance is telling us there\u2019s a problem in nature.\u201d\n\nThese declines are likely linked to habitat loss\n\nAccording to Rosenberg, the biggest factor driving these declines is habitat loss and degradation. A lot of these birds\u2019 breeding and nesting grounds are being transformed into fallow fields due to expanding agricultural development, the authors wrote.\n\n\u201cGrassland birds are some of hardest hit, along with birds like the red-winged blackbird that prefer farmland and rural landscapes,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s no question that the intensification of agriculture, as farmers squeeze out grassy margins and trees to make room for acres of corn, is impacting birds.\u201d\n\nOther risk factors for birds include predators like cats; collisions with glass, buildings, and other structures; and the possible toxicity of the insects that they eat.\n\ncaption A barn swallow sits atop a branch. source Karen Hogan, Macaulay Library at Cornell Lab of Ornithology\n\nThe pervasive use of pesticides like neonicotinoids in the US has likely contributed to bird losses as well, Parr added.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have categorical proof, but it\u2019d be very surprising if the billions of pounds of insect poison being spread across the landscape wasn\u2019t connected to the decline of insect-eating birds,\u201d he said.", "description": "Business Insider - A new study found that there's been a 29% decline in bird populations in the US and Canada since 1970..
