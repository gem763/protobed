The possession of e-cigarettes or similar devices will also be an offense, with a punishment of up to six months in prison and a fine of up to 50,000 rupees ($705).\n\nIndia\u2019s Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman made the decision based on recommendations from the Group of Ministers, which she leads.\n\n\"E-cigarettes were promoted as a way to get people out of their smoking habits but reports have shown that many people are not using it as [a] weaning mechanism but are rather addicted to it,\" Sitharaman said when the ban was carried out.\n\nThe decision was a follow up of a 2018 advisory that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government sent to all state governments asking them to consider banning e-cigarettes.\n\nIn May of this year, a government body first published a report recommending a ban on vaping, which stated there was insufficient research into the health impacts of smoking e-cigarettes to guarantee it was safe.\n\nThe white paper by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said e-cigarettes contain not just a highly addictive nicotine solution, but also other potentially dangerous and breathable substances such as flavouring agents and vapourisers. The report cited studies by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) studies into vaping, and the deaths of at least 13 people in the US reportedly due to mysterious e-cigarette-related illnesses has led to calls for bans around the world.\n\n\"These novel products come with attractive appearances and multiple flavors and their use has increased exponentially and has acquired epidemic proportions in developed countries, especially among youth and children\" Indian government statement accompanying e-cigarette ban\n\nThis move could put off the expansion plans of companies such as Juul Labs Inc and Philip Morris International in India, which has 106 million adult smokers - second only to China in the world \u2013 making it a lucrative potential market for companies selling vaping products.\n\nJuul had plans to launch its e-cigarette in India and has hired several senior executives in recent months. Philip Morris had plans to launch its heat-not-burn tobacco device in India.\n\nThe government said the decision to ban e-cigarettes is aimed at protecting the country\u2019s young people, who are most vulnerable to its health hazards.\n\n\"These novel products come with attractive appearances and multiple flavors and their use has increased exponentially and has acquired epidemic proportions in developed countries, especially among youth and children,\" the government said in a statement accompanying the ban.\n\nThe government also argued that vaping can lead to nicotine addiction and push users towards consuming tobacco.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThis is something that pro-vaping groups dispute - they argue that vaping is less harmful than smoking tobacco and that the ban will deprive millions of smokers of a safer solution to cut back on smoking.", "description": "India banned e-cigarettes a week ago - it faced its first legal challenge on Thursday.", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Vaping-India.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
