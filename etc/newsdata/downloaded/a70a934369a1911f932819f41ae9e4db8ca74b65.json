She is earnest where many are regarded as cynical. Fractious while others are chummy. An activist freelancer whose rivals inhabit berths with the big media players. To her fans, Cadwalladr is an icon\u2014a brave, irreverent, truth-seeking missile, exposing a nexus of corruption that is subverting our body politic, not only the Woodward and Bernstein of Brexit, but also its Emmeline Pankhurst, tirelessly campaigning for what she sees as a just outcome. But to her opponents, she is something else: a hysterical middle-aged conspiracy theorist, someone who pushed her stories beyond what the facts supported and who was willing to legally threaten journalists she was working with to get her way\u2014or, in the words of the BBC journalist Andrew Neil, a \u201cmad cat woman.\u201d She may also be among the most consequential reporters of her age, changing the way we talk about Facebook with her revelations of how Cambridge Analytica was mass-harvesting data to influence elections, and supercharging a movement for electoral reform with stories about illegalities at a pro-Brexit campaign group. Her articles have triggered investigations, were partly responsible for hauling Mark Zuckerberg in front of Congress, and helped result in Facebook being fined several billion dollars. They have also won her more than a dozen awards, and seen her named as a finalist for a Pulitzer. She is even the thinly veiled inspiration for the journalistic hero in a recently released young-adult novel.\n\nYet as her star has risen, so have her opponents. Operatives from Vote Leave, the pro-Brexit campaign group subject to her investigations, have gone from outsiders who managed to win the 2016 referendum to dominating Boris Johnson\u2019s new British government. Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave\u2019s former campaign director\u2014who has accused Cadwalladr of spreading a \u201cloony conspiracy theory\u201d\u2014is now one of the prime minister\u2019s most influential advisers. As Brexit spawns an American-style culture war in Britain, Cadwalladr has become a lightning rod. Her rise also reveals something about the state of British media, where social-media-powered campaigners can become megastars. How did she become the most polarizing reporter in Britain? Is Cadwalladr even a reporter, or more of a campaigner\u2014an activist with policy goals she is pursuing through journalism? Does it matter? To get to know Cadwalladr, I spent time with her in January, watching her at work, and have exchanged messages with her for months. Our initial meeting did not take me to The Guardian\u2019s offices in central London, but to her Instagram-perfect apartment, full of flowers, white walls, and communist kitsch in a privatized apartment on a public-housing block a few minutes from some of the most genteel parts of North London. Sitting at her feet is Meg, her aging collie cross retriever. There is no cat. Before she found herself on the trail that led to her fame, Cadwalladr and a friend were developing a script for a television show. The plot centered on women who, despite their lack of traditional academic qualifications, are recruited by Britain\u2019s domestic intelligence service for their neglected skills and emotional intelligence. This is very much her vibe: an extremely funny, relentlessly sweary, exceedingly down-to-earth and highly unlikely candidate to be flung into a world of spies and disinformation.\n\nWhen she began her investigation into Cambridge Analytica, Cadwalladr says, she did not even have a permanent pass to enter The Guardian\u2019s headquarters. Though The Guardian has a large full-time staff based in London and elsewhere, it\u2014like many other outlets, including The Atlantic\u2014also employs freelance journalists and pays them for individual stories or projects. Complex, risky, and ultimately award-winning investigations into data harvesting by the United States\u2019 National Security Agency and Cambridge Analytica were written entirely, or in large part, by freelancers. The paper actually wrote about Cambridge Analytica before she did, but failed to capitalize on a 2015 scoop revealing the firm was harvesting Facebook data. In 2017, after publishing an article on the company\u2019s ties to the American billionaire Robert Mercer, Cadwalladr began contacting former employees on LinkedIn. Eventually, she was introduced to Christopher Wylie, the pink-haired former staffer who would, over time, become famous for blowing the whistle on its practices, saying he felt a \u201chuge amount of shame\u201d about the data he weaponized in 2016. \u201cHe\u2019s like Snowden,\u201d Cadwalladr recalls telling her editors, referring to the contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked the NSA story, \u201cbut he\u2019s like the gay, fun Snowden.\u201d When Cadwalladr presented her reporting to The Observer, The Guardian\u2019s Sunday edition, she told me her editors said it would have to run as a short news story. Convinced it couldn\u2019t be told in just a few hundred words, Cadwalladr walked out of the meeting, taking the story to the all-female team of feature editors at The Observer\u2019s New Review, typically home to light Sunday reads. \u201cI was like, \u2018Okay, that\u2019s it \u2026 The women are going to have to do this one,\u2019\u201d Cadwalladr joked. The article eventually came out a month later\u2014appearing in both the New Review and, in shorter form, the news pages\u2014after almost a year of work.\n\nThroughout, Cadwalladr was talking and working with Wylie almost daily, a relationship that illustrates her journalistic style: She does not operate like a traditional reporter, favoring objectivity and distance; instead, she becomes close to her subjects, intensely\u2014and, her critics would argue, unethically\u2014so.\n\nFor Wylie to speak publicly, she helped find him legal representation, and in her telling, Wylie\u2019s lawyers then pursued a financial backer to cover his legal fees in the event he was sued. She says she was not informed who the backer was, and did not mention the issue in her articles. According to Cadwalladr, The New York Times and Britain\u2019s Channel 4 News, which were partnering in the investigation, were informed of the arrangement, and Wylie\u2019s lawyers did due diligence to make sure the backer wasn\u2019t \u201ca Russian oligarch or something\u201d and to avoid any other \u201cconflict of interests.\u201d (A Times spokesperson said that the paper was not aware of the financial-backer arrangement and that Cadwalladr\u2019s actions \u201cwould violate our journalism guidelines, which cover outside contributors.\u201d Channel 4 News said it knew of, but could not independently identify, the backer. A spokesperson for Guardian News and Media, the parent company of The Guardian and The Observer, declined to comment, saying, \u201cWe are not going to go into confidential discussions between editorial colleagues.\u201d) Some might see the failure to disclose the financial-backer arrangement as a violation of journalistic standards, one that left her (and her stories) vulnerable to questions about such a backer\u2019s motives, but Cadwalladr believes that her close relationship with Wylie was essential to informing the public. \u201cI can say with 100 percent certainty that an American journalist who treated their source with cool detachment and distance would never have gotten this story,\u201d she says. \u201cWylie would never have trusted them, and the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica story would have gone unreported.\u201d She says she found it \u201centirely reasonable\u201d for Wylie to seek a financial backer because he \u201cwas taking a huge legal and financial risk\u201d in coming forward, which required him to break a nondisclosure agreement. (Wylie did not respond to an interview request or a message that Cadwalladr says she sent him suggesting he speak with me for this article; his lawyer did not respond to a request for comment on the financial-backer arrangement.)\n\nBecause The Guardian did not employ Cadwalladr full-time, its ability to exercise control over her was limited, allowing her to blur the distinction between journalist and activist. Though the newspaper\u2019s lawyers advised her not to, in advance of her article being published, she shared some of her reporting with an official British investigation into Cambridge Analytica after authorities approached her, and she put former employees in contact with them. (Representatives from Channel 4 News and The New York Times said they were not aware she had done this.) Cadwalladr also relied heavily on storytelling, and lots of it\u2014it took a veteran feature writer and author of a well-reviewed novel, rather than a classic investigative reporter, to make complicated stories about tech, data, and political funding go viral. Yet The Guardian\u2019s presentation has been criticized by some journalists, including Michael Lewis, while a particular gripe among pro-Brexit critics was that Cadwalladr presented Wylie\u2019s work at Cambridge Analytica as a devastating secret weapon that could swing elections for those who hired him, rather than expressing skepticism about his claims. Separately, Nick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister who is now Facebook\u2019s vice president of global affairs and communications, has dismissed claims that Cambridge Analytica influenced the Brexit referendum, suggesting \u201csome kind of plot or conspiracy\u201d was a simplistic crutch to explain away the result.\n\nThe particular approach Cadwalladr brought to her reporting was obvious to Shahmir Sanni, a former volunteer for Vote Leave. Sanni blew the whistle on the campaign\u2019s significant overspending, which the Electoral Commission later found to be illegal. When Sanni realized irregularities were taking place, Wylie, whom he said he had met \u201cin the gay scene\u201d and who initially introduced him to Vote Leave, brought him into the fold with Cadwalladr. The journalist then turned him into a centerpiece profile and, as she\u2019d done with Wylie, presented him as a heroic whistle-blower. \u201cShe is an activist,\u201d Sanni, who is still close with Cadwalladr, told me. \u201cOf course, she\u2019s a journalist whatever, but she\u2019s both a journalist and an activist.\u201d The Cadwalladr I got to know was accumulating awards faster than many journalists accumulate bylines. But the baubles seemed hardly to have mattered. She appeared not only burned out, but also slightly traumatized by her own Twitter supernova. As we talked, she would often speculate about murky, hidden connections, which I struggled to unspool. Cadwalladr is constantly relitigating her findings online, and fending off activist media outlets such as the pro-Brexit website Guido Fawkes, which has published stories attempting to discredit her work. Having suffered harassment and legal threats from some of the top pro-Brexit campaigners, Cadwalladr has come to believe that there is a \u201ccoordinated campaign\u201d against her.\n\nShe sharply criticizes the BBC\u2014Britain\u2019s public broadcaster, which is still largely revered both here and abroad\u2014as no longer being impartial and having engaged in a \u201ccover-up\u201d over the illegalities she has reported, and once took legal action against Channel 4 News, a former partner on her stories, accusing it of attempting to breach a publication agreement against her source\u2019s wishes. She frequently knocks other outlets too\u2014BuzzFeed News has published, in her words, \u201chit pieces\u201d about her work and \u201cspent months and months going after me.\u201d (A BuzzFeed spokesperson said in a statement that the organization\u2019s reporting \u201creally speaks for itself\u201d and noted that it included responses from Cadwalladr.) What further singles out Cadwalladr\u2019s crusade from the usual journalistic self-promotion, though, is that she has expressed a political objective: \u201ca Mueller-style public inquiry\u201d into Brexit. And she has been good at it, radicalizing those who support Britain\u2019s staying in the EU; she has been lauded in Parliament, and several prominent lawmakers have joined in her call. All the while\u2014as she engages in debates online and goes after her critics\u2014she receives a near-constant torrent of sexist abuse, which she showed me on her phone. One of the most extreme examples was a video of her being repeatedly hit in the head as the Russian national anthem played\u2014a video posted to Twitter by Leave.EU, another pro-Brexit campaign group, run by the businessman Arron Banks. \u201cLike my worst nightmare\u201d was how she described the comments, \u201ctrying to shame me for not being married, for not having children, for being a middle-aged woman.\u201d Many of the recurring Twitter attacks she mentioned to me appeared to be themed on the notorious barb from Neil, the BBC journalist: Trolls disparage her, commenting that it is \u201ctime to feed the cat\u201d or \u201ccrazy cat lady kicking off again.\u201d The BBC anchor, she says, has not apologized. Neil did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPaul Webster, the editor of The Observer, is quick to point out that British reporters have always been more adversarial and politicized than their American counterparts. \u201cWhat is new is this is all taking place online,\u201d he says. Great investigations might even play out this way in the future, he argues\u2014a future where some journalists are celebrities, their work furiously promoted by online fandoms and denigrated by trolls. All this, he says, has made Cadwalladr \u201can extraordinary phenomenon.\u201d Cadwalladr, for her part, describes herself as \u201can activist for the truth,\u201d telling me that it\u2019s \u201cnot enough just to find out the truth, go through all the legal checks and balances and publish it. What I\u2019ve discovered is that I\u2019ve had to advocate for my journalism.\u201d What\u2019s next for Cadwalladr? The answer is bound up in that one word that has been making or breaking media reputations on both sides of the Atlantic: Russia. Cadwalladr\u2019s campaign and online persona\u2014but not her reporting\u2014has leaned heavily on the notion of Russian involvement in Brexit. She has accused the leader of the Brexit Party, Nigel Farage, and Banks of receiving foreign funds, while highlighting a Vote Leave official\u2019s contacts with \u201cKremlin-aligned groups.\u201d (Farage has denied allegations that the Brexit Party received illegal foreign money.) Her tweets have also bought into a lot of the imagery of the so-called Resistance media in the United States. Her occasional podcast, produced independently of The Guardian, is called \u201cDial M for Mueller.\u201d\n\nBoth the governing Conservatives and opposition Labour Party here in Britain, she says, \u201chave got reasons not to want to excavate problematic connections to Russia.\u201d Why? She claims the Conservatives have taken money from \u201cRussian oligarchs.\u201d A spokesman for the party rejected the allegation, noting, \u201cIt is illegal in this country to accept foreign donations,\u201d and adding that \u201cdonations to the party are properly and transparently declared to the electoral commission according to the law.\u201d Cadwalladr, for her part, says this does not rule out wealthy Russian donors, such as Alexander Temerko, who have a history of ties to Russian intelligence and who are also British citizens. She also claims that Seumas Milne, consigliere to the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, has \u201cpro-Putin views.\u201d This, she tweeted, is influencing Labour\u2019s ambivalent Brexit stance. The party\u2019s greatest worry about seriously investigating alleged illegalities in the Brexit referendum, Cadwalladr argues, is that it might turn up proof and be forced to respond, alienating the pro-Brexit voters the party won over in recent years. The Labour Party did not respond to a request for comment, saying it never comments publicly about staff. Cadwalladr\u2019s claims have not gone unnoticed by fellow journalists: The connections, without clear evidence, on topics such as Brexit and the comments of Boris Johnson have made her arguably the most sarcastically subtweeted person on British political Twitter.\n\nWhere will all this end? Will Cadwalladr wind up like Glenn Greenwald, with a loyal following but a controversial alt-reporting platform? Or Seymour Hersh, a former star dented and dimmed after a series of questionable claims? She has launched a crowdfunding account on Patreon, drawing on donations from supporters who pledge monthly amounts to back her work. At its peak in January, Cadwalladr had 411 donors who had collectively pledged $2,143 a month. As of yet, nothing has been posted on the site. Cadwalladr says she hopes to use these funds\u2014as well as winnings from a \u20ac20,000 ($22,500) prize given to her by Sweden\u2019s Stieg Larsson Foundation\u2014to create her own website, called The Citizens, to lead \u201cthe online Twitter sleuths.\u201d These are the anti-Brexit and anti-Trump activists she collaborates with, blending campaigning with citizen journalism and, she hopes, eventually connecting the dots between Donald Trump, Russia, and Brexit. The arrival of Johnson and Cummings at Downing Street has sent her feuds and fundraising into overdrive. Cadwalladr\u2019s reporting has put direct pressure on Cummings\u2014in March, he was found in contempt of Parliament after refusing to appear before a committee investigating fake news, with an agenda largely set by Cadwalladr\u2019s revelations. The new prime minister has, meanwhile, dismissed as \u201ccodswallop\u201d a video she obtained showing Steve Bannon boasting of his ties to him.", "description": "Carole Cadwalladr may be the most consequential journalist of her age.
