After more than two and a half years of anguishing over how to respond to Trump\u2019s assault on constitutional democracy, things suddenly seem to moving at light speed for Democrats.\n\nRepublicans changing?\n\nPerhaps more importantly, something may be changing for Republicans as well.\n\nFormer Ohio Gov. John Kasich tweeted on Monday that \u201cI have a simple message for GOP members of Congress: Where are you? Are you hiding under a rock? This is not political. This is our national security we\u2019re talking about here. The intel committees in Congress need to review the information. Follow the law!\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve gotten used to the idea that nothing will be enough to move Republicans to take action when it comes to Trump scandals, so Kasich\u2019s words seemed unlikely to have any impact. But this time Kasich didn\u2019t seem to be howling into the wind.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate voted unanimously, 100-0, to pass a resolution calling on the Trump administration to provide House and Senate intelligence committees with a copy of a whistleblower complaint that reportedly relates to Trump\u2019s efforts to enlist Zelensky\u2019s assistance in winning re-election.\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky agreed with New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer\u2019s request for an immediate vote on the nonbinding resolution, bypassing ordinary debate. This is unusual, to say the least.\n\nWorking with Democrats\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly standard procedure for McConnell to help out Democrats \u2014 and it may have had an impact. The White House, which had been blocking transmittal of the whistleblower complaint to Congress, has now reportedly dropped its objections and is negotiating to allow the whistleblower to speak to members of Congress.\n\nMcConnell isn\u2019t the only Republican who seems to be interested in Congress getting access to the relevant information. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah said on Twitter that \u201cIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival\u2026it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out.\u201d\n\nRepublican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, who faces a tough campaign for re-election in 2020, said when asked if he supports the president, \u201cLet\u2019s find out what\u2019s happening. Let\u2019s get to the bottom of this.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like the routine we\u2019ve gotten used to each time a new Trump scandal emerges when Republicans robotically fall in line behind the president.\n\nThe math of removal\n\nThis is intriguing, of course, because impeachment can only have a chance of leading to Trump\u2019s removal from office if Republicans are on board. Assuming that the House votes to impeach and all 47 Democratic senators decide against the president in a Senate trial, it would take 20 Republican senators to end Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nThat still seems like a long shot, to say the least. But, as I mentioned, things are moving really quickly, and no one can say for sure where this will end up.\n\nIf the reports are correct \u2014 and some of what we know comes from Trump\u2019s own public admissions \u2014 the president engaged in a massive abuse of power that depended on undermining the legitimacy of U.S. elections by pressuring a foreign country to help him win re-election.\n\nNot for the first time, Trump seems to be acting more like a caricatured version of a mob boss, using whatever leverage is available to him (in the case, military aid to Ukraine provided by Congress through legislation) in an effort to advance his personal interest in place of the national interest.\n\nTrump understandably seems worried \u2014 there is a report that he asked Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi if they could work something out regarding the whistleblower complaint (Pelosi, a California Democrat, reportedly responded by saying to Trump: \u201cTell your people to obey the law\u201d).\n\nTaking control of narrative\n\nPelosi seems to be making a move to take control of the narrative. That will be challenging for several reasons.\n\nFirst, Trump is a skilled manipulator when it comes to the media \u2014 and he has Fox News and the right-wing media megaphone behind him. Second, Pelosi will have to keep Democrats organized and on point. It will be essential to stay focused.\n\nIf impeachment proceedings advance on too many fronts, the thread of the story could get lost. The Ukraine scandal is worth emphasizing \u2014 it is easy to understand, it is explosive, it is already damning, it is ongoing as it relates to the 2020 campaign, and it is likely to get worse for Trump.\n\nGaining Republican support for impeachment would be a tall order.\n\nHere, Pelosi and congressional Democrats will need help from Kasich and other prominent Republicans. It could be useful to have former President George W. Bush and other Republicans with household names make the same point Kasich made \u2014 that the allegations against Trump raise national security concerns that go to the heart of our constitutional republic.\n\nIt will be essential for prominent Republicans in Congress \u2014 Romney, for instance \u2014 to remain objective rather than serving as a Praetorian Guard personally loyal to the president rather than the Constitution (as some unfortunately are doing).\n\nHighest stakes\n\nThis is a test for our constitutional system, and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. If Trump weathers this storm, he will quite reasonably believe that he enjoys carte blanche to use whatever underhanded tactics, to recruit assistance from as many foreign actors as he likes, in order to win re-election.\n\nOn the bright side, for all Americans \u2014 Republicans, Democrats, and Independents \u2014 who want to preserve our system and hold a free and fair election in 2020, there is now a glimmer of hope.", "description": "After years of anguishing over how to respond to Donald Trump\u2019s assault on constitutional democracy, things suddenly seem to moving at light speed for...", "authors": ["Chris Edelson"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR971_trump__ZG_20190924155711.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
