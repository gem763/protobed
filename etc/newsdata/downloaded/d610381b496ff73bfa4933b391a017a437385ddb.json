The awards are a recognition of work that advances each of the respective fields. Nobel winners are given a medal, a certificate and a cash award of about $900,000 (when multiple people win a single Nobel, they typically split the cash award.)\n\nHere are the 2019 Nobel Prize winners (so far):\n\n2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\n\nWilliam G. Kaelin Jr., Sir Peter J. Ratcliffe and Gregg L. Semenza won the 2019 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. The trio \u201cidentified molecular machinery that regulates the activity of genes in response to varying levels of oxygen,\u201d according to The Nobel Assembly. Their work, says the Assembly, has \u201cpaved the way for promising new strategies to fight anemia, cancer and many other diseases.\u201d\n\n2019 Nobel Prize in Physics\n\nJames Peebles, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz won the 2019 Nobel Prize in physics. Peebles, of Princeton University, received half of the award, per the Nobel Assembly, for work focused on \u201ctheoretical discoveries in physical cosmology,\u201d while Mayor and Queloz, of the University of Geneva (and, for Queloz, Cambridge University) shared half the award \u201cfor the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s Laureates have transformed our ideas about the cosmos,\u201d the Assembly wrote in a release accompanying the Prize\u2019s announcement. \u201cWhile James Peebles\u2019 theoretical discoveries contributed to our understanding of how the universe evolved after the Big Bang, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz explored our cosmic neighborhoods on the hunt for unknown planets. Their discoveries have forever changed our conceptions of the world.\u201d\n\n2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nThe 2019 Nobel Prize in chemistry will be announced on Wednesday, Oct. 9.\n\n2019 Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nThe 2019 Nobel Prize in literature will be announced on Thursday, Oct. 10. The 2018 Nobel Prize in literature will also be announced on Thursday, Oct. 10; last year\u2019s announcement was canceled in the midst of sexual assault allegations.\n\n2019 Nobel Prize in Peace\n\nThe 2019 Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday, Oct. 11.\n\n2019 Prize in Economic Sciences\n\nThe 2019 Prize in economic sciences will be announced on Monday, Oct. 14.", "description": "The first award went to a trio for their research into cellular oxygen use", "authors": ["Alex Fitzpatrick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8ThUbXxlEaCWr4lQrw48CA--~B/aD02ODI7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/96cc866dd932df61e1237c4e84767db7", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
