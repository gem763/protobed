This concept is a more adventure friendly version of Honda\u2019s Super Cub. However, unlike the Super Cub 125, the CT125 does not get a front apron, headlamp cover, fork covers or full fenders. Instead, it sort of reminds us of the TVS XL 100 with simple fenders and a large cargo rack.\n\nAlso read: Honda CT125, 2020 Africa Twin & More At 2019 Tokyo Motor Show\n\nIt also gets a frame guard that runs on both sides of the 124cc motor and a bash plate underneath. The motor casing looks similar to the Super Cub 125, which means that the CT125 could feature the same 124cc powerplant that delivers 9.65PS of power and 10.4Nm of peak torque.\n\nThe CT 125 is game for mild off-road trails thanks to its spoke wheels fitted with dual-purpose tyres. It also gets a small front fender and high mounted \u2018scrambler-style\u2019 exhaust pipe. Even the air intake and air filter have been mounted higher for better water wading capability.\n\nAdditional kit includes disc brakes at both ends with single-channel ABS as standard. It also sits higher off the ground than the standard Super Cub as well as a suspension tuned for off-road. We think the CT125 could be a fun runabout to take on light trails thanks to its lightweight and minimalistic bodywork. Sadly, it won\u2019t come to India anytime soon.", "description": "The CT125 gets spoked wheels and a scrambler-style exhaust to take on rough terrain", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.zigcdn.com/media/content/2019/Oct/honda-ct-125-comcept-1_300x225.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
