It is a moving average that attracts a lot of attention, and quite frankly makes for good headlines. Longer-term traders do tend to pay attention to it, so looking at that indicator could give you an idea as to where the longer-term trend is going. All things being equal though, I don\u2019t like trying to short this market, because I think there is a significant amount of support underneath and it\u2019s obvious that central banks around the world are going to be cutting interest rates. Given enough time, that should give a bit of a lift to gold.\n\nGold Price Predictions Video 23.10.19\n\nYou could make a downtrend line based upon the recent channel lower, and although it has been a significant pullback, in the big scheme of things it isn\u2019t as big of a deal. The market had gone higher for what seemed like forever, so a little bit of consolidation and then a pullback as traders take profit makes but a bit of sense. At this point, if we can break above the $1500 level that might be the signal to start buying again for the longer-term move. Obviously, the larger numbers like $1500 attract a lot of attention so I would anticipate quite a bit of follow through on a daily close above that level. Until then, it\u2019s probably going to be more or less a grind.\n\nPlease let us know what you think in the comments below\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "Gold markets went nowhere during the training session on Tuesday as we continue to see a lot of consolidation overall.
