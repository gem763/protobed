Joel Embiid motioned for him to let it fly. Simmons took a couple more steps, stopped and popped.\n\nSwish.\n\nFans celebrated Simmons\u2019 first career 3-pointer as if the Philadelphia 76ers had just won Game 7 of the NBA Finals. Embiid ran over and hugged him, teammates rushed the court and the internet went wild.\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly impossible to mention Simmons without adding jump shot in the conversation since his debut in October 2017. The 23-year-old Simmons is considered one of the best players in the world despite his reluctance to shoot jumpers in his first two seasons.\n\nThe All-Star point guard told The Associated Press last month that he allowed criticism to bother him, but he \u201cfell in love with the game again\u201d over the summer during the countless hours he spent in the gym working on his shot.\n\nSimmons realizes adding a jumper would make him a complete player.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge part of the game, so if it\u2019s open I\u2019ll take it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I was just too worried about what people were saying, what was going on around, too many outside noises, and I was able to block them out this summer and not really focus on what people say. I don\u2019t really care anymore unless it\u2019s coming from someone in my circle or someone who is trying to help me get better.\u201d\n\nSimmons is 0 for 18 from 3-point range in his career, including playoffs, so making one even in a preseason game was a big deal for everyone - except him and his coach.\n\n\u201cI think the whole thing is so overblown,\u201d Brett Brown said. \u201cI think in general, it\u2019s so inflated the attention.\u201d\n\nSimmons sat out his first season with a broken right foot after the process-trusting Sixers selected him No. 1 overall in the 2016 draft. He earned Rookie of the Year honors the following year and became an All-Star for the first time last season. He has helped lead the Sixers to the second round of the NBA playoffs twice, and has averaged 16.4 points, 8.5 rebounds and 7.9 assists.\n\nQuestions about his ability to shoot sometimes overshadow everything he does well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident in saying I\u2019m not a great shooter,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m getting better, though. It\u2019s a game. There are five people on the court. I lack something that I\u2019m not great at it but there\u2019s other areas I\u2019m very great at it. I run the floor as well as anybody. I\u2019m physical. I can rebound the ball. At 6-foot-10, I\u2019m a point guard, I can guard one through five, but (shooting is) just one thing that\u2019s coming into my game which I\u2019m excited about. I love getting better. I love spending time in the gym and building that confidence.\u201d\n\nSimmons worked with trainer Chris Johnson in Los Angeles during the summer, and videos showing him shooting teased fans for months.\n\n\u201cI believe if you continue to work, good things will happen over time, and that\u2019s what I will continue to do to keep playing the game I love at a high level,\u201d he said.\n\nSimmons is quiet and reserved, a bit uncomfortable around media, but he\u2019s vocal about speaking out against racism. He is the executive producer of a documentary about Adam Goodes, an Australian football player and anti-racism advocate. It opens Saturday at the Philadelphia Film Festival.\n\n\u201cEveryone has a voice and everyone has different levels of (a platform) and, together as one, people can create change around the world,\u201d he said.\n\nSimmons is also passionate about helping children in the community. He delivered new sports equipment to students in Camden, New Jersey last month and showed up at an elementary school in Philadelphia earlier this week to donate more than 600 new winter coats.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, my parents told me I have a huge responsibility with what I do and if I have a chance to help kids, I love to do that,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Simmons became the face of smartwater, joining the brand whose goal is to encourage proper hydration.\n\n\u201cThey continue to build themselves up and get better and that\u2019s how I see myself as a player,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to continue to get better.\u201d\n\nSimmons, Embiid, Tobias Harris and new additions Al Horford and Josh Richardson give Philadelphia its best starting lineup since Hall of Famers Julius Erving, Moses Malone, Maurice Cheeks and Bobby Jones led the 76ers to their last NBA title in 1983. Jones came off the bench for that team while Andrew Toney and Marc Iavaroni rounded out the starting five.\n\nSimmons says his only goal is to win a championship. He\u2019s also focused on being an excellent defender.\n\n\u201cI want to be the best defensive player on the team,\u201d he said at the team\u2019s media day. \u201cSo hopefully everyone on my team hears that, and they strive to do the same thing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The crowd screamed for Ben Simmons to shoot as he dribbled near the perimeter in a preseason game against a team from China.
