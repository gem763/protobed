Marrero described the president's argument as \"repugnant to the nation's governmental structure and constitutional values.\"\n\nIn addition, the effort by Trump to scuttle the city prosecutor's subpoena would protect any potential accomplices from facing justice while Trump remained in office, Marrero noted \u2014 a sweeping claim of immunity that could result in Trump and his allies being above the law. Similar arguments have been soundly and repeatedly rejected by the Supreme Court and other federal judges, he ruled.\n\n\"The notion of ... presidential immunity from judicial process that the President here invokes, unqualified and boundless in its reach described above, cuts against the grain of these Constitutional precedents,\" wrote Marrero, an appointee of President Bill Clinton in 1999.\n\nThe president filed an emergency appeal on Monday.\n\nTrump and his attorneys argued that the subpoena for records, issued by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., was politically motivated and could impinge on Trump's ability to carry out his presidential responsibilities. They sought relief from the federal courts, arguing that New York state courts would not be a fair or proper venue\n\nBut Marrero rejected the notion that any evidence suggests Vance Jr.'s subpoena was issued in \"bad faith\" or that New York courts would now be equipped to adjudicate the president's challenge.\n\nMarrero's most dramatic conclusion, however, may be his charged swipe at the Justice Department's legal guidance that a president cannot be indicted while in office.\n\n\"The court is not persuaded that it should accord weight and legal force the president ascribes to the DOJ memos,\" Marrero wrote.\n\nHe noted that the argument a sitting president cannot be indicted often relies entirely on these memos, which don't carry the force of law or legal precedent.\n\n\"[T]he theory has gained a certain degree of axiomatic acceptance ... as though their conclusion were inscribed on constitutional tablets so-etched by the Supreme Court,\" he said.\n\nRather, Marrero said a better balance might be struck between protecting legitimate presidential interests and ensuring justice can be served \u2014 either to the president or potential accomplices who would otherwise be shielded from prosecution. He also noted that the ODJ memos only speak to federal prosecution \u2014 not state or local.\n\nMarrero's comments on the DOJ memos \u2014 which have been a feature of Trump's legal arguments against investigations into him, his company and his associates \u2014 are some of the first made by a federal judge. And he notes that the memos based on hypothetical circumstances and \"hyperbolic horrors\" conjured by DOJ lawyers.\n\n\"In fact, not every criminal proceeding to which a President may be subjected would raise the grim specters the DOJ memos portray as incapacitation of the president,\" he argues.\"\n\nThis report first appeared on politico.com on Oct. 7, 2019.", "description": "The New York judge also rejected the notion that a sitting president can't be indicted.", "authors": ["Kyle Cheney"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/05/96/8e2bbc0e481886b4e9ba079dad09/191007-trump-wh-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
