But she is also affiliated with the liberal-centrist Renew Europe group in Parliament, which has yet to suffer a casualty in the confirmation process. That makes her a potential target for MEPs in other groups who want to even up the scores.\n\nIn addition, Goulard is a close ally of Emmanuel Macron. Some could see her hearing before the industry and internal market committees as a chance to exact some retribution for the French president's successful efforts to take down the Spitzenkandidat system, intended to give the Parliament more power in the selection of the Commission president.\n\nGoulard is also facing a legal investigation in France over allegations that European Parliament assistants were used for domestic political work. And she has come under scrutiny for her work as a highly paid consultant for a U.S. think tank while she was an MEP.\n\nOn Tuesday, Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bellamy, the leader of the French delegation within the EPP group, threatened to block the nomination of candidates \"who are the object of legal investigations.\" Goulard, he noted, is \"under two investigations\" over the employment of parliamentary assistants.\n\n\"The decision to exclude our Hungarian colleague from the European Commission is motivated only by political and ideological considerations,\" Bellamy said in a statement. \"If a colleague who has never been the object of a legal procedure is blocked as he was, how can you let through candidates who have been convicted in the past, or who are currently the object of legal investigations?\"\n\nOther members of the EPP group, however, were less strident. They said they had not taken any decision to oppose Goulard.\n\nOfficially, as far as the Parliament is concerned, questions over Goulard's use of assistants are closed after she paid back money owed for what a spokesperson described as \u201cadministrative errors which were not intentional and not systemic.\u201d She has also insisted she did nothing wrong in terms of her consultancy work for the U.S.-based Berggruen Institute think tank.\n\nLast week, Goulard successfully cleared the first nomination hurdle in the Parliament when the Legal Affairs Committee, which examines financial declarations of nominees, declared her free of concerns about conflicts of interest.\n\nOne official from the center-left Socialists & Democrats group said Goulard \"was cleared too easily\" by the Legal Affairs Committee. But that does not necessarily mean the group will oppose her in the confirmation process. The official said the group expects Goulard to \"make assurances that her pending cases won't affect the whole College of Commissioners.\"\n\nOne bloc that has already pretty much declared its hand is the far-left GUE group. A spokesperson said the group is \"unlikely to support Goulard's nomination,\" because aside from concerns about ethics and legal cases, \"we have severe doubts about her political history on the national level and record as an MEP.\"\n\n\"Given her background as defense minister, we believe that the portfolio mix of digital economy, industrial policy and internal market together with defense industry and space will rather serve the interests of the arms industry than the public,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nHowever, Goulard also has a solid base of friends in the Parliament and many believe she still has a good chance to pass the confirmation test.\n\nA Renew Europe official said he was \"confident\" while still being \"cautious\" about Goulard's chances.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mario Monti, a former Italian prime minister and European commissioner who worked with Goulard, and Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister who served as liberal leader in the European Parliament, weighed in to back the French nominee ahead of her hearing.\n\nIn a letter seen by POLITICO's Brussels Playbook, the pair declared \"that her track record prior to her election to the European Parliament, as well as her skills, are rare.\"\n\nThey also vouched for Goulard's European spirit, listing roles such as chairing the European Movement in France, \"the first civil society association promoting Europe in a large Member State.\"\n\n\"She can work in four languages and has written several books on European issues,\" the duo also attested.\n\nOn the Berggruen role, Monti and Verhoftstadt \"firmly conclude that Ms Goulard's activities as Special Adviser ... took place in a context in which no actual or potential conflict of interest could arise with her activities as MEP.\"\n\nA Renew Europe official said he was \"confident\" while still being \"cautious\" about Goulard's chances. He suggested it would be difficult for MEPs to justify voting against \"a woman who is excellent, speaks many languages, and knows the house [Parliament].\"\n\nHowever, others in the group say that while Goulard's work with Berggruen was not illegal, it is harder to defend from an ethical standpoint. Goulard was reportedly paid \u20ac10,000 per month before tax, on top of her European Parliament salary, for work with the California-based think tank while also working as an MEP.", "description": "French nominee for European Commission faces tough questions in confirmation battle.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Lili Bayer", "Carmen Paun"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1167508360-1200x628.jpg"}
