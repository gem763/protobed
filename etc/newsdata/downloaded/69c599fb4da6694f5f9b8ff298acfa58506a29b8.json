They were \u2014 and Jay was devastated to learn that the dead body was none other than Terry Bates.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the fact that Coker and Mitchell were conducting his father\u2019s killer\u2019s funeral that annoyed Jay, but also the fact that Terry was being hailed as something of a hero \u2014 as over 200 people were expected to attend the event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith a new rage on display, Jay told Callum to leave him alone, but Callum rang Ben (Max Bowden) to help him deal with the situation. Ben took over things at Coker\u2019s, and informed Terry\u2019s widow that the establishment would no longer be conducting the service, but \u2014 upon reflection \u2014 Jay decided that he would, in fact, help organise Terry\u2019s funeral.\n\nAs the episode came to a close, Jay spoke to Terry\u2019s body, berating him for everything he\u2019d put him through, before informing him that all those in attendance at his funeral will know the truth.\n\nJay\u2019s plotting revenge for sure, but will he carry out his threat?\n\nOr will Lola (Danielle Harold), Callum or Ben be able to talk him out of it?\n\nEastEnders continues Thursday 24thOctober at 7:30pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "An incredibly emotional day resulted in Jay making a huge decision.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jay-Brown-EastEnders-297e_1571770863.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
