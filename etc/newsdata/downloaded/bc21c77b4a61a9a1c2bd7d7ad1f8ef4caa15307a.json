But for some, the biggest take-away from the new clips was the announcement that there will be less instalments this time around.\n\nPrevious series of the show have clocked in at around either 10 or 11 episodes each, so news the number has been cut in half hasn\u2019t gone down well with some fans, especially considering the comedy\u2019s been off-air now for two years.\n\nFans are also wondering how they can possibly stretch out all five episodes in as long a time as possible \u2013 because you never know, it may be another two year wait for season five.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the creators have owned up to the shorter stint, calling the new episodes \u2018half the season you deserve, all the season we could handle\u2019.\n\nDespite the shocking turn, acolytes of the show are already second-guessing what kind of brain-bending twists they\u2019re in store for.\n\nThey reckon that Evil Morty could actually play a pivotal role in the new season and there\u2019s been hints of a very ominous \u2018beeping\u2019 app.\n\nRick and Morty season four will air in November while seasons one to three air on Channel 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
