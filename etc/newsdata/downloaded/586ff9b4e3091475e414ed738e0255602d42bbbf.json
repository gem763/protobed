Trump got away with it the first time. The lesson he learned was to try again.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump has no shame\n\nBack in the early days of the Trump presidency, Trump\u2019s enablers wistfully suggested he might grow into the job as he learned not to do corrupt things.\n\nIn June 2017, news broke that Trump had demanded that FBI Director James Comey go easy on Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national-security adviser. \"The President's new at this,\u201d then-House Speaker Paul Ryan said at the time. \u201cHe's new to government. So, he probably wasn't steeped in the long-running protocols that establish the relationships between DOJ, FBI and White Houses. He's just new to this.\u201d\n\nGive him time, Ryan seemed to suggest, and Trump might stop acting like a criminal in office.\n\nTrump drew a very different conclusion from the one to which Ryan hoped to nudge him. He concluded: Nobody is going to stop me.\n\nThe breathtaking thing about Trump\u2019s latest abuse is how many people knew about some, or all, of it as it happened. Vice President Mike Pence personally spoke to the Ukraine president about the importance of \u201ccorruption\u201d\u2014which in Trump-speak, means the importance of doing more of it, not less of it.\n\nActing White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney relayed the order to block the distribution of congressionally voted funds to Ukraine.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo extracted statements from Ukrainian officials, in what seems like an effort to shield Trump from the scandal.\n\nAnd all of this happened in plain sight. Everybody could see the money being withheld for months after Congress voted it. Everybody knew that Trump\u2019s personal emissary, Rudy Giuliani, had traveled to Ukraine to seek dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden. Giuliani appeared on TV to talk about it!\n\nThere\u2019s no mystery, there\u2019s never been a mystery. There\u2019s only been impunity, and there continues to be impunity.\n\nTrump has never been furtive. He commits his wrongs in the full glare of publicity. Bribes to Trump are not delivered by shadowy men in underground garages. They are collected right on Pennsylvania Avenue, in a garish hotel with Trump\u2019s name right on the door. Trump does not stealthily embezzle Republican donations. The party simply books its events in his premises, every misappropriated dollar counted and disclosed. When Trump invited Russia to hack his opponent and deliver her e-mails to him, he did it on live television.\n\nTrump takes advantage of a human tendency to think: If he\u2019s not ashamed, maybe he did nothing wrong. Normal people are taken aback by pathological people, and Trump is the most pathological president in American history.\n\nBut we\u2019re at the breaking point. The Ukraine story confirms that Trump will do anything. Anything. Everything.\n\nHe relies on everybody around him being too dazed, too psychologically weak, to resist him and uphold even the most basic legality and decency. So far, he\u2019s gambled right. It\u2019s time\u2014way past time\u2014to prove him wrong.", "description": "The Ukraine scandal confirms that Trump knows he can act with impunity\u2014and no one will stop him.", "authors": ["David Frum", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19266593489811/facebook.jpg?1569328704", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
