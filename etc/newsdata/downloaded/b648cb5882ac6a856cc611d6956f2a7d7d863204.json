Bush at Cowboys game", "language": "en", "text": "Ellen DeGeneres has responded to the backlash over her football game hang out with George W. Bush.\n\nA day after the Ellen DeGeneres Show host was seen chatting and laughing with the former president \u2014 and his wife, Laura Bush \u2014 at the Dallas Cowboys football game, she addressed online critics taking issue with the fact that she would be acting friendly toward someone with differing political views.\n\nDeGeneres explained that she and her wife, Portia de Rossi, were guests of Charlotte Jones, the daughter of the Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. And while there were \u201c100,000 people in the stadium\u201d for the game, \u201cthey showed a shot of me and George laughing together \u2014 and so people were upset.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cThey thought, why is a gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president... But a lot of people were mad, and they did what people do when they\u2019re mad \u2014 they tweet.\u201d\n\nYes, that was me at the Cowboys game with George W. Bush over the weekend. Here\u2019s the whole story. pic.twitter.com/AYiwY5gTIS \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) October 8, 2019\n\nInstead of sharing a negative tweet, DeGeneres picked a nice one, which said, \u201cEllen and George Bush together makes me have faith in America again.\u201d\n\nAs the audience clapped, DeGeneres said, \u201cExactly. Here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m friends with George Bush,\u201d who has appeared on her talk show. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have. We\u2019re all different, and I think we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s OK that we\u2019re all different.\u201d\n\nShe went on to say, \u201cFor instance, I wish people wouldn\u2019t wear fur. I don\u2019t like it, but I\u2019m friends with people who wear fur. And I\u2019m friends with people who are furry, as a matter of fact. I have friends who should tweeze more,\u201d she quipped.\n\nDeGeneres wrapped up by saying, \u201cBut just because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them. When I say, \u2018Be kind to one another,\u2019 I don\u2019t only mean the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn\u2019t matter [who].\u201d\n\nShe thanked Jerry and Charlotte Jones for hosting them as well as the Bushes \u201cfor a Sunday afternoon that was so fun,\u201d adding, \u201cBy the way, you owe me $6 for the nachos.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
