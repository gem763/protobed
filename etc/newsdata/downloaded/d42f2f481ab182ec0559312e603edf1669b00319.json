The Blues will raise their championship banner during a pregame ceremony Wednesday night.\n\nBut the Blues made one major move last week, acquiring offensive-minded defenseman Justin Faulk from Carolina for Joel Edmundson and a prospect. The team then signed the 27-year-old Faulk to a $45.5 million, seven-year extension, banking on him being a key part of its future.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the other major moves in the offseason on the ice, behind the bench and in the front office:\n\nBYE, BLUE JACKETS\n\nColumbus lost a trio of stars in free agency, the only unrestricted free agents to sign seven-year contracts with other teams.\n\nDynamic forward Artemi Panarin received an $81.5 million deal from the New York Rangers. Two-time Vezina Trophy winner Sergei Bobrovsky took his talents to the Florida Panthers for $70 million just after Roberto Luongo retired. And two-time All-Star center Matt Duchene signed a $56 million deal with the Nashville Predators.\n\nColumbus has a lot of cap space, perhaps planning to make a splash next summer, because it didn\u2019t spend a lot of money chasing success with free agents. The Blue Jackets did add 30-year-old winger Gustav Nyquist with a $22 million, four-year contract after he had a career-high 60-point season.\n\nSAVVY STARS\n\nThe Dallas Stars have built a Cup-caliber team and know now is the time to spend in free agency. They added a pair of veterans motivated to prove they can still play after spending their entire careers with one team.\n\nThe Stars lured three-time All-Star forward Joe Pavelski away from the San Jose Sharks with a three-year deal worth $21 million. They made a much smaller investment in 34-year-old winger Corey Perry, whose contract was bought out by the Anaheim Ducks. Perry\u2019s $1.5 million, one-year contract could be quite a bargain if he can provide more scoring depth for Dallas.\n\nTAKING A FLYER\n\nMinnesota missed the playoffs for the first time in seven years and made an aggressive move to pay 32-year-old Mats Zuccarello $30 million over five years even though he has only one 20-goal season and that was three years ago. Vancouver gave 29-year-old defenseman Tyler Myers a $30 million, five-year deal after he had consecutive seasons with 30 points for the first time since his first two years in the league. The Canucks are trying to avoid the first five-year playoff drought in franchise history.\n\nFOLLOW THE LEADER\n\nShortly after Florida\u2019s season ended, the Panthers hired three-time Stanley Cup winning coach Joel Quenneville to take perhaps the top leader in the league off the market.\n\nThree former Edmonton coaches Todd McLellan (Ottawa), Dallas Eakins (Anaheim) and Ralph Krueger (Buffalo) are getting another shot to lead teams.\n\nThe Oilers, meanwhile, are hoping former Adams Award winner Dave Tippett can get the most out of Connor McDavid\u2019s supporting cast and guide them into the playoffs for the just the second time in 14 years. Alain Vigneault, another former NHL Coach of the Year, landed a job in Philadelphia.\n\nThe rebuilding Ottawa Senators are taking a chance on former Toronto Maple Leafs assistant D.J. Smith, giving him his first opportunity to be a head coach in the NHL.\n\nUPSTAIRS\n\nThe Detroit Red Wings brought Hall of Famer Steve Yzerman back to be their general manager. The former Tampa Bay Lightning general manager replaced Ken Holland, who later left to lead the Oilers\u2019 front office. The Wild are giving two-time Stanley Cup winner Bill Guerin his first opportunity to run an NHL front office after he helped the Pittsburgh Penguins win two Cups as assistant general manager.\n\n___\n\nAP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The St. Louis Blues will look a lot like the team that won the franchise's first Stanley Cup when the puck drops for the NHL's season-opening game against the 2018 champion Washington Capitals.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Larry Lage"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/islanders_rangers_hockey_44205_c0-321-3845-2562_s1770x1032.jpg?116b1dd268cf57bf34cbae7dce223c15df54659d"}
