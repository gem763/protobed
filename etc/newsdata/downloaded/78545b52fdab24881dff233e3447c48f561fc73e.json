It took a step in the direction of resolving China-US economic and trade issues, serves the interests of the Chinese and American people and is generally welcomed by the international community.\"\n\nThe piece argued that \"solving the structural problems in bilateral economic and trade relations over the years cannot be achieved overnight.\"\n\nMr Mnuchin insisted the two sides came to agreements on intellectual property protections, issues related to financial services, currency and foreign exchange, and structural concerns related to agriculture. But, as The Post noted, \"the White House did not release a single fact sheet about any of those issues or how things would be changed.\" And Chinese officials indicated they need to engage in another round of negotiations before committing to any terms on paper.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Mnuchin renewed the threat of another round of tariffs, telling CNBC that 15 per cent import duties on roughly $US160 billion of Chinese goods will still hit on December 15 barring an agreement. \"I have every expectation if there's not a deal those tariffs would go in place, but I expect we'll have a deal,\" he told CNBC.\n\n\"Pardon us if we are confused, but the events of the last few days have been confusing,\" High Frequency Economics chief international economist Carl Weinberg writes in a note, adding that \"red flags are flying all around this alleged deal . . . This 'deal' - if indeed there really is one - obviously addresses only a small part of the laundry list of complaints the Trump administration has with Beijing.\"\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson was harsher, calling the agreement a \"twentieth of a deal . . . and even that is not yet certain.\"\n\nHe wrote off as \"trivial\" the relief provided by the suspension of a tariff hike scheduled to hit this week. \"It's possible that further negotiations over the next couple of months will change that, but for now the substance of this agreement is that China plans substantially to step up purchases of US farm products, which it needed anyway, in return for the deferment of a tariff increase,\" he writes in a note. \"We remain of the view that a comprehensive deal will not be struck until after the 2020 election, and the economy will suffer in the meantime.\"\n\nStocks fell as investors processed that the deal amounted to meaningfully less than the Trump administration's billing: The S &P 500, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq all shed 0.1 per cent. The economic ripple effects of an underwhelming agreement could be worse: Morgan Stanley writes that employers who had been banking on a breakthrough may start laying off workers now that no such progress is evident.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "Steven Mnuchin has admitted that a lot of work needs to be done on the China trade deal that Donald Trump claimed was the \"greatest and biggest\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2197%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1195b100df1eaa92bb3a51a489833daf6c30358c", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
