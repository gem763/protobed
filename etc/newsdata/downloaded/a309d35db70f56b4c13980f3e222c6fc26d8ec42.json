(AP) - Ryan Fitzpatrick has news for anyone believing the Dolphins intend to bow down meekly and tank their way to a winless season and the No. 1 overall pick in next year\u2019s draft.\n\nThe 15-year journeyman is no stranger to playing for rebuilding teams and saw signs of the Dolphins improving following a 31-21 loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m the perfect man for this job, because I\u2019ve been through it,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cI have zero ego. All I want to do is go out there and win. I want to bring an energy.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick did just that Sunday, inspiring a winless and beleaguered Miami team to its best offensive performance of the season.\n\nThe Dolphins (0-6) became the first opponent to score more than 17 points against the Bills this season. And Fitzpatrick became the first to top 250 yards against Buffalo since New England\u2019s Tom Brady did it in prime time last October.\n\nPlaying on the field where he created the \u201cFitzMagic\u201d buzz in 2011, Fitzpatrick went 23 of 35 passing for 282 yards and a touchdown. He ran for an 11-yard TD with 1:45 left by lowering his head and powering through Bills safety Micah Hyde at the goal line.\n\nBut as has often happened during his career, Fitzpatrick was undone by one fateful play.\n\nWith 5:07 left in the third quarter, Miami was up 14-9 and had a second-and-goal at Buffalo\u2019s 12. Fitzpatrick threw a pass toward Isaiah Ford in the right corner of the end zone only to have it intercepted by a diving Tre\u2019Davious White.\n\nThe Bills then marched 98 yards to the go-ahead touchdown on a 20-yard pass from Josh Allen to John Brown on the third play of the fourth quarter. White then set up another touchdown after he punched the ball out of the hands of rookie receiver Preston Williams.\n\nThough the Dolphins fell short a week after a 17-16 loss to Washington, they continued sending a message of not buying into fans scooping up \u201cTank For Tua\u201d T-shirts, in reference to Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nWhite was impressed by how Fitzpatrick kept Buffalo\u2019s defense at bay by leading consecutive 75-yard touchdown drives.\n\n\u201cHe did a great job of picking us apart early and often and extending drives and having our offense on the sideline,\u201d White said. \u201cHe did a great job of reading our coverages and our disguises.\u201d\n\nDolphins rookie coach Brian Flores credited Fitzpatrick for \u201cplaying well,\u201d and acknowledged the quarterback earned the right to earn another start ahead of second-year quarterback Josh Rosen.\n\n\u201cHe got us out of trouble a couple of times, and made some plays for us,\u201d Flores said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to continue to build and get better and finish a game.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick can relate to how a team can improve.\n\nHe was part of the Bills opening 0-8 in 2010 after replacing starter Trent Edwards three games into the season before Buffalo won four of its final eight.\n\nThe same, he believes, could happen in Miami.\n\n\u201cI want to try to be that guy, the stable guy that they can look to when things get a little shaky,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a different career than a lot of quarterbacks. It\u2019s a career I\u2019ve loved and a position that I like being in.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick is very fond of the four years he spent with the Bills, and had to laugh in noting he made one fundamental mistake before the opening kickoff.\n\nHe walked out of the visiting locker room and turned right - the way the Bills turn when they head out to the field - rather than left.\n\nFor two-plus quarters, Fitzpatrick had the Dolphins pointed in the right direction.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ryan Fitzpatrick has news for anyone believing the Dolphins intend to bow down meekly and tank their way to a winless season and the No. 1 overall pick in next year's draft.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerry Sullivan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/dolphins_bills_football_07924_c0-120-4490-2739_s1200x700.jpg?c1cdf53195f36912ac146d5ab18421c240bd7f06", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
