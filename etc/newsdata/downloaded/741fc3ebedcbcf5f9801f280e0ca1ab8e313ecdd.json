Michael Keane was deemed to have fouled Aaron Connolly in the box and Neal Maupay converted from the spot.\n\nAnd Graham Potter\u2019s side found a winner with seconds remaining as Digne inadvertently guided a cross into his own net.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Lys Mousset made it two goals in two with a side-footed volley, placed expertly into the far corner.\n\nWest Ham could have won it late on when Snodgrass, stretching to meet a Pablo Fornals cross at the far post, saw his effort cannon off the post.\n\nBut there was no late winner and the points were shared. Newly promoted Sheffield United now sit seventh.\n\nStill no win for Watford\n\nWatford remain winless and rooted to the bottom of the Premier League table after labouring to a goalless draw against Bournemouth.\n\nThe home side had chances to score in the second half, Will Hughes testing goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale, who had already made an impressive save to deny Gerard Deulofeu.\n\nIt was very nearly Bournemouth who left with the points, though, as Harry Wilson skimmed a low free kick against the post.", "description": "Marco Silva\u2019s woes continue at Everton An injury-time own goal from Lucas Digne saw Everton fall to a late defeat despite having led Brighton twice at the Amex Stadium.
