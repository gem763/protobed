If you can\u2019t, can you go to the bank to draw a bank cheque?\u2019\u201d Yee said. \u201cI would have handed [the cheques] to Ernest, and Ernest would hand me the cash.\u201d\n\nThe former local election candidate said the scheme flew under a $1,000 donation threshold and hid the true source of the money, which Wong did not reveal.\n\nAccording to Yee, weeks after that episode Wong approached the restaurateur again, wanting up to 10 people to put their name to $5,000 donations.\n\n\u201cHe said that he will find the money ... through several people but he didn\u2019t mention who it was,\u201d Yee told the inquiry.\n\nYee said he was surprised to get an email from NSW Labor head office with the specific names he should use to sign those forms, given most on the list had been involved in the Minns cheque scam.\n\nHe eventually signed up himself, his brother, his mother, a friend, the family business and five employees.\n\nYee said he was not told the true identity of the donor until 2017, a claim the Icac chief commissioner, Peter Hall QC, said \u201cbeggars belief\u201d and led to demands that he \u201ctell the truth\u201d, leading the former local election candidate to breathe heavily and pause before telling the inquiry Wong did not specifically name the true donor after the March 2015 dinner.\n\n\u201cBut I would assume it would come from [Huang],\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPreviously, Mr Huang has donated to the party and he was one of the biggest donors at that time.\u201d\n\nAs a property developer, Huang was banned from donating to NSW political parties and does not appear on the public NSW donation disclosure log going back a decade.\n\nYee conceded he had co-ordinated with Wong to run interference throughout the NSW electoral commission and Icac\u2019s investigations into the donation scandal, including telling straw donors exactly how to answer specific questions.\n\nBut, while admitting he had \u201cmost definitely\u201d abused their trust, he denied pressuring or threatening anyone to falsely declare as a major political donor.\n\nWong, in evidence to the commission in early September, said he had never asked Huang for a donation and the billionaire volunteered to personally deliver a bag of cash raised at the event to Labor head office.\n\nYee will continue giving evidence on Tuesday.", "description": "Chris Minns announces decision following restaurateur and former political hopeful Jonathan Yee\u2019s testimony", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0d6520a91490dbbf72a53cee6d7dde34ae6f893/0_0_2474_1485/master/2474.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b95f84545306b23382641036a6577d8a", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
