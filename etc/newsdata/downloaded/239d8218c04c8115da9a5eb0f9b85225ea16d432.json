A period of 14 days should be more than ample time to address an administrative slip or technical problem.\"\n\nThe ASX had also proposed mandatory reporting of LIC portfolios, however that has been sidelined for the time being to allow for more consultation.\n\nThe exchange will introduce a censure power, targeting individual rule breakers, which it believes will be a more effective deterrent than a fine.\n\nThe bourse did note it would \u201conly exercise its power of censure against an entity where it considers the entity\u2019s breach of the listing rules to be egregious and after first providing the entity with an opportunity to comment on the proposed terms of the censure\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that ASX keeps evolving the listing rules so they remain contemporary, address emerging compliance issues, and continue to serve the interests of issuers, investors, and the Australian economy,\" Mr Lewis said.", "description": "The Australian Securities Exchange has toughened its listing rules in a bid to improve the integrity of the market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2174%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_107/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b48be074260d5c418bd1b547aebabe9cfc99e2fc", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
