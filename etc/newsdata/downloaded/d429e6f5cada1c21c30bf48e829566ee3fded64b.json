Our secret is out but we couldn\u2019t be happier to share the news.\"\n\nA friend of James\u2019s said: \u201cHe seems finally to have found \u2018The One\u2019.\u201d\n\nTelling the story of how the couple met, they claimed Alizee stopped to say hello to one of James' dogs while at South Kensington Club.\n\nThe pal added: \u201cAfter Alizee went back to her table, James asked the waiter to give her a note saying: \u2018I never normally do this, but would you like to go for a drink with me?\u2019\"", "description": "Kate Middleton and Prince William's son Prince Louis, who is fifth-in-line to the throne, is tipped to have a special part at the weddings of Princess Eugenie, and uncle James Middleton", "authors": ["Amber Hicks", "Image", "Getty Images", "Uk Press Via Getty Images", "Afp Getty Images", "Credit Too Long", "See Caption"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20573283.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Trooping-The-Colour-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
