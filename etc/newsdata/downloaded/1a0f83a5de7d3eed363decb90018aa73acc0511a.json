It\u2019s a mix of Jane Fonda workout tape and 1980\u2019s video nasty. The classic AHS theme song is reimagined as a jazzercise banger, as images of aerobic workouts are juxtaposed with an unseen slasher cleaning and sharpening his various blades. Emma Roberts gets top billing, with Billie Lourd coming in second. Will one of them be the typical 80\u2019s Final Girl? No sign of Sarah Paulson in the titles, so it does indeed look like she\u2019s giving season 9 either a complete miss or very little of her time. According to Murphy, the titles were done in collaboration with Corey Vega, whose fan edit sparked the idea for the murder and legwarmers mash-up. American Horror Story: 1984 premieres September 18 on FX.", "description": "Ryan Murphy dropped the American Horror Story: 1984 opening credits on his Instagram Thursday morning.
