It\u2019s a go-to closing for emails, even those that don\u2019t require action from the recipient. But when\u2019s the last time you sat down outside of that 37-message-long email thread and wrote a thank you note to a colleague?\n\nFreelance writer Emily Monaco recently wrote for The Muse about her efforts to increase the number of thank-you notes she writes. She started with friends and family members, but soon expanded her weekly practice to members of her professional network.\n\nShe thanked experts she had interviewed for articles, a journalist whose work she admired, and a former supervisor who had influenced her workflow. While she didn\u2019t expect anything in return from the notes, she said, Monaco often found that there was an impact on her working relationships, even in subtle ways.\n\nTake, for example, a note to an editor she enjoyed working with.\n\nWhen one project with an editor I\u2019d quite enjoyed working with came to an end, I sent her a proper \u201cthank you\u201d email saying as much. She wrote back, encouraging me to pitch again to fill an unexpected hole in her editorial calendar. My note had reminded her who I was long after invoices had been filed, and it felt like our relationship had evolved from a transactional one to something more like true colleagues.\n\nI like Monaco\u2019s endeavour because it forces you to take time to reflect amidst whatever to-dos are on your list for the future. Maybe you\u2019ve capped off a large project, had a professional breakthrough, or recalled a lesson from the past that\u2019s been applicable recently.\n\nTaking time to acknowledge others who helped make your progress happen \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 can help you see how far you\u2019ve come and can prompt you to acknowledge your achievements.\n\nA genuine note of thanks doesn\u2019t need to take so long that it becomes another burden on your schedule. And it doesn\u2019t need to be sent by snail mail if you don\u2019t enjoy handwritten correspondence.\n\nYou can tap out a short email or even send a text message, depending on your relationship. There\u2019s no need to gush \u2014 all you have to do is tell the recipient why you appreciate them or their work.", "description": "Professional communication includes a lot of thanks.
