They're taking no chances.\"\n\nIn October last year, Seann, 32, and pro star, Katya, 29, kissed outside a London pub on a night out.\n\n(Image: David Dyson)\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nA witness said: \"They were snogging like a pair of teenagers and didn't seem to care who might see them.\"\n\nBut Seann had kissed his Strictly Come Dancing partner on multiple occasions, eyewitnesses claimed.\n\nThe shamed comedian was publicly dumped on by Rebecca Humphries after pictures of him smooching Katya dropped online.\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\nHe was slammed for his brief apology statement, in which he made no mention of his live-in girlfriend of five years, and said the kiss that was caught on camera was \"a one-off drunken mistake which I am truly sorry for\".\n\nAt the time, Katya - who is married to Strictly's choreographer Neil Jones - said her marriage was rock solid.\n\nBut it's since been claimed that Seann and Katya embarked on more than one game of tonsil tennis - and were actually seen drinking in a quiet central London pub every night for a week before they were caught in a passionate late-night embrace.\n\n\"Katya and Seann came in to the pub every night that week at about 9.30pm,\" one regular at The Duke of York pub in Marylebone told the Sun , adding that neither of them wore workout gear when they showed up.\n\n\"They looked like a normal couple - really comfortable with other and they were quite tactile with each other at bar. No one knew who they were and they really kept themselves to themselves, choosing to sit outside.\"\n\n*Strictly Come Dancing returns on Saturday at 6:40pm", "description": "The show's producers have banned fans from taking photos on site following the Seann and Katya cheating scandal", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "David Dyson", "Daily Record", "Internet Unknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16526069.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Strictly-Come-Dancing-2018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
