And as far as the decision about removing Sarfraz is concerned so it is based on just his poor form and nothing else,\u201d Misbah told the reporters in Lahore in a presser in which he announced Test and T20I squads for Australia tour.\n\n\u201cNeither i have any personal issues with Sarfraz nor anyone else in the board. The only reason is his performance that ousted him from the team. Sarfraz is a good player and if he gains his performance back while playing domestic cricket, he will make comeback,\u201d he added.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that the PCB removed Sarfraz from captaincy in all three formats of the game with immediate effect. Despite having won 12 T20I series out of 14 as captain he was overthrown by inexperienced Babar Azam while the Test captaincy has been given to already tested Azhar Ali.\n\nThe board\u2019s decision was followed by immense criticism as cricket fans highly opposed the decision of removing one of the most successful captains in Pakistan\u2019s cricket history. On Sunday, fans gathered outside Sarfraz\u2019s residence in Karachi and demanded justice for the wicket-keeper batsman.\n\nMoreover, former cricketers also called PCB wrong in taking away T20I captaincy from Sarfraz.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Pakistan cricket team's chief selector Misbah-ul-Haq reacted on the recent protests in Karachi and reports in the favor of former captain Sarfraz Ahmed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Saifi-2-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
