Even now, they continue to equivocate about obeying the law of the land.\n\nThe latest example of the depths to which they will stoop comes courtesy of Cummings (again).\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Would someone care to point me in the direction of any humour?\n\nSmall wonder that consideration is being given to how we might better maintain order, and the law, in future.\n\nBut while a written constitution might well be a good idea \u2013 it\u2019s something I\u2019ve long supported \u2013 it would not be a panacea.\n\nIf you want evidence, take a look across the Atlantic, where another ill mannered demagogue dedicated to trashing convention holds sway.\n\nDonald Trump has overseen the separation of migrant families at the US border, an obscene money grab on the behalf of the super rich, made repeated attacks on the free press, encouraged violence against people protesting his misrule, and even said there were \u201cgood people\u201d among the neo-Nazis who took to the streets in Charlottesville.\n\nNone of these things, terrible as they are, violate the US constitution.\n\nHe suffered a notable setback when US courts ruled against his Muslim travel ban, only for the US Supreme Court to reverse their decision by upholding a revised version, courtesy of its Conservative majority.\n\nThat majority has been bolstered by Trump\u2019s appointment of ideological soulmates whose interpretation of the constitution can be counted on to align with his own.\n\nOne of them, Neil Gorsuch said during his confirmation hearings: \u201cI do not see Republican judges, and I do not see Democrat judges. I see judges.\u201d\n\nAnalyses of their voting patterns suggest justice isn\u2019t anything like as blind as he implies.\n\nWhile there have been instances of justices ruling against type, and moving away from their ideological homes after their appointments, neither Gorsuch nor Brett Kavanagh, who has faced repeated allegations of sexual misconduct that he has denied, seem like good candidates to do this.\n\nTrump appears to have the court in his pocket. And his allies on the religious right are already flexing their muscles in an attempt to use that to test the hallowed separation of church and state.\n\nA professor of government could doubtless point to many better ways of selecting justices to a body which a potential written British constitution could look to.\n\nThe justices serving on Britain\u2019s existing Supreme Court, who do not currently have the power to strike down legislation on constitutional grounds, aren\u2019t political appointees, although the lord chancellor in theory has the power to reject candidates put forward by a selection commission.\n\nNor do they have unlimited tenure.\n\nBut where am I going with this? The key point is that a written constitution doesn\u2019t necessarily protect against assholes, or arseholes, with questionable mandates deciding the rules don\u2019t apply to them.\n\nIf bad people have the will they can do bad things regardless of whether they live under a written or an unwritten constitution.\n\nAll it requires is for them to have sufficient numbers of enablers and for those responsible for upholding the checks and balances that are essential in any democratic system to either fail in their duties, or to join their number.\n\nJohnson, Cummings and their allies seem determined to test Britain\u2019s constitutional arrangements. Maybe the Supreme Court will stop them. Parliament can\u2019t do anything more because, of course, it\u2019s not sitting. It has had a crack with the anti-no deal law, which may also test the mettle of the courts.\n\nWe are in a very dangerous place. If you want to see how dangerous, read your 20th century history. Tyrannies don\u2019t always require guns for their establishment. Cynics, cheerleaders and weak men and women will do the job well enough.", "description": "Could a written constitution save us from the worst instincts of a gangster government?
