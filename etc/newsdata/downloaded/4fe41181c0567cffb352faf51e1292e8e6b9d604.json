This includes Google allowing Huawei to have access to the Google Play Store.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t affect the Chinese market too much, as Chinese smartphone users haven\u2019t had access to the Google Play Store, and Chinese app developers have made their own hugely popular apps in place of popular apps available outside of China.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nDetails about Huawei\u2019s latest upcoming smartphones \u2013 the Mate 30 series \u2013 are leaking, and unfortunately for Huawei fans outside of China, it won\u2019t matter one bit.\n\nThere\u2019s no point in checking out the leaks and rumors for the Huawei Mate 30 phones, unless you want to see what you\u2019ll be missing out on. No matter what kinds of specs, features, cameras, or design it might sport, the Huawei Mate 30 series of smartphones won\u2019t have the one crucial thing that makes an Android phone worthwhile outside of China: Android apps from the Google Play Store.\n\nIndeed, the US government\u2019s ban on American companies doing business with Huawei prevents the Google Play Store from featuring on Huawei smartphones.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a shame, because the Mate 30 phones have all the makings of a great Android smartphone, including a beautiful design, multiple cameras, great specs, and great battery life.\n\nCheck out one of the leaked photos of the Mate 30 Pro:\n\nThe Huawei Mate 30 phones will reportedly still run an open-source version of Android, according to Reuters, but not a version that gives access to the Google Play Store, where users can find and install all the apps they want.\n\nWithout access to Google\u2019s Play Store, those who buy a Mate 30 smartphone won\u2019t have access to the apps they\u2019re used to using.\n\nGmail? Nope.\n\nGoogle Maps? Gone.\n\nYouTube? Negative.\n\nFacebook? Messenger? Instagram and WhatsApp? Most likely not.\n\nSnapchat, Netflix, TikTok, Spotify, Pandora, Hulu, and Amazon? Unlikely.\n\nHuawei fans in China are used to this. Android phones in China haven\u2019t had access to Google\u2019s Play Store for years and Chinese app developers have made their own hugely popular apps, like social media platform Weibo, ecommerce app TaoBao, and the \u201cNetflix of China,\u201d IQIYI.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Huawei\u2019s phones will still be sold outside of China, like in Europe, Canada, Australia, and anywhere else where Huawei has successfully sold its smartphones in the past. We\u2019ll have to wait until Thursday to find out. But it\u2019s truly unclear who outside of China would want a Huawei phone if it doesn\u2019t run the apps they want.", "description": "Business Insider - Unfortunately for Huawei fans outside of China, the Huawei Mate 30 smartphone won't be an appealing option thanks to the ongoing trade war..
