But it\u2019s a noteworthy bet on a slightly old-fashioned model, and it\u2019s also interesting as an effort by the world\u2019s largest theatrical chain to diversify, particularly as box office numbers decline.\n\nIn the announcement, AMC Theatres President and CEO Adam Aron argued that AMC has a particular advantage, because it can use its data about the movie-going habits of Stubs members to deliver targeted offers.\n\n\u201cThe addition of AMC Theatres On Demand, which extends our movie offerings for AMC Stubs members into their homes, makes perfect sense for AMC Theatres, for our studio partners and for our millions of movie-loving guests,\u201d said Aron in a statement. \u201cWith more than 20 million AMC Stubs households, and with our web site and smartphone apps already being visited hundreds of millions of times annually by movie fans, AMC Theatres is in a unique position to promote specific movies with greater personalization than has ever been possible before.\u201d\n\nAMC Theatres On Demand has more than 2,000 films, drawn from all the major studios, available at launch. (As an extra incentive, if you buy or rent a movie distributed by Lionsgate or Paramount Pictures, you\u2019ll get an extra three movies from the same studio.) The company says the service will be available via web, mobile apps and smart TV apps \u2014 though it doesn\u2019t mention specific devices.\n\nAMC has already been experimenting with new business models, responding to the popularity of the (now-defunct) MoviePass with its own theatrical subscription, Stubs A-List.", "description": "AMC Theatres announced a new service today called AMC Theatres On Demand \u2014 a marketplace where members of AMC\u2019s Stubs loyalty program can buy or rent individual movies to watch at home.
