This video, shared to the Sandusky police department\u2019s Facebook page, shows a bright flash from powerlines above and sparks bursting across the road. \u201cWe request the public to co-operate when we are trying to cordon off an area, we are watching out for your safety. Please be careful with down power lines!!!\u201d police said in a caption alongside the footage. Credit: City of Sandusky Police Department via Storyful\n\nA new unit development in southeast Melbourne has shocked neighbours, as developers have included a high-voltage electrical tower inside of one of the unit\u2019s backyards.\n\nThe three-unit development on Clarinda Road in Clarinda, Melbourne, contains the partial base of a 50m tall high-voltage cable pylon that sits just metres from the back door of one of the units. Neighbours have called the construction around the tower \u201cdangerous\u201d, saying it \u201cbuzzes\u201d in wet weather.\n\nThe construction of the backyard and its fence around the power tower was approved by the Kingston City Council (KCC), according to The Herald Sun.\n\nNeighbours Narvada and Suttianand Seebaluck, whose home backs onto the still-vacant units, are horrified by the development. They pointed out that children using the backyard would be at risk of climbing the structure, which carries a terrifying 275 volts.\n\n\u201cIt looks bad, and the tower is dangerous to live near,\u201d said Ms Seebaluck. \u201cWe can hear the buzzing whenever it\u2019s windy or raining.\u201d\n\nAnother neighbour, Salma Thani, said there was \u201cno way\u201d residents living in the home could stop children climbing the tower.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of houses around here near powerlines, but not that close,\u201d Ms Thani said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously very dangerous. There\u2019s no way you could stop kids from climbing up onto it.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, KCC said the builder \u201ccomplied with all requirements\u201d relating to the building permit.\n\nThe KCC general manager of planning and development, Jonathan Guttmann, further explained the tower, operated by AusNet Services, had met safety requirements.\n\nMr Guttmann said council sought the community\u2019s input and received \u201cno objections\u201d.\n\nCouncil has not revealed the name of the building group behind the construction.\n\nDo you think this backyard is safe?
