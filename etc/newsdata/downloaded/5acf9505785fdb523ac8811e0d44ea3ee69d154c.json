After all, since Feb. 2002, the Patriots have won six Super Bowls and the Red Sox four World Series.\n\nSo it\u2019s only fitting, really, that Chris Weidman launches his bid for a second UFC weight-class title underneath the combined 23 Celtics and Bruins championship banners at Boston\u2019s TD Garden.\n\nWeidman (14-4 MMA, 10-4 UFC), the former UFC middleweight champion, makes his light heavyweight debut on Friday night in the main event of UFC on ESPN 6, where he takes on up-and comer Dominick Reyes (11-0 MMA, 5-0 UFC).\n\nAnd in case you need a reminder of just how lethal Weidman is when he\u2019s at his best, the UFC has made his crowning moment available to watch for free in the lead to the card.\n\nAt UFC 162, Weidman, though undefeated, was a heavy underdog in his fight against Anderson Silva. And not without reason: Silva was at the high point of his powers, with a title reign of nearly seven years, which remains the longest in UFC history, and 16 straight UFC victories, which is also remains a record.\n\nBut Silva got a little too cute with his clowning, and Weidman was on to him, leading to one of the most memorable knockouts in UFC history.\n\nUFC on ESPN 6 takes place Friday at TD Garden in Boston. The card airs on ESPN2.\n\nYou can watch Weidman\u2019s historic finish of Silva in the video linked above.", "description": "Chris Weidman's knockout of Anderson Silva at UFC 162 was the stuff of MMA legend.", "authors": ["Mma Junkie Staff", "Dan Tom", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Simon Head", "The Blue Corner", "Abbey Subhan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/chris-weidman-anderson-silva-ufc-162.jpg?w=640&h=488&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
