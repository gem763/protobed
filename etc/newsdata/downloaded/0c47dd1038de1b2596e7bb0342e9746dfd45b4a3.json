Its fund family has suffered six straight years of outflows. Its stock has the lowest Wall Street ratings of any major money manager.\n\nNo wonder Franklin Resources Inc.\u2019s shares are down 48% in the last five years, and the firm, which oversaw $693 billion as of Sept. 30, has lost almost a quarter of a trillion dollars in assets since its 2014 peak.\n\nInstead of hitting the panic button, the company is betting that new technology and an $8.5 billion cash hoard for acquisitions can engineer a turnaround. Franklin is opening a financial technology incubator next week at its San Mateo, California, headquarters. And it will be savvy in hunting for deals that spur growth, according to Jenny Johnson, president and chief operating officer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be patient and make sure it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\nJohnson, whose grandfather started Franklin in 1947 and named it for an American founding father, only needs to look out her Silicon Valley office window to see how tech disrupts established businesses. Across the investing world, robo-advisers, index funds and zero-fee trades are undercutting revenue.\n\nWith her brother, Chief Executive Officer Greg Johnson, she\u2019s trying to bring the spirit of innovation inside the firm\u2019s granite clad colonial-style buildings.\n\nOn Oct. 15, Franklin will hold a ribbon-cutting for the fintech incubator on its leafy campus. In a shared work space, representatives from early-stage firms in payments, cybersecurity and other specialties will be side by side. For the host, it\u2019s a chance to get early looks at ideas, talent and potential acquisitions, according to Rory Moore, CEO of Franklin\u2019s partner in the operation, startup mentor EvoNexus.\n\nRandom Forest\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really worried about their future,\u201d Moore said. \u201cEvery month, there\u2019s a company founded somewhere in California that\u2019s going to completely disrupt areas of financial institutions.\u201d\n\nIf not disrupt, enhance. An example is Random Forest Capital, a startup Franklin bought last year whose machine-learning tools screen massive amounts of consumer-debt data to detect credit risks that elude traditional analysis. The insights complement but won\u2019t replace human managers, according to Sonal Desai, Franklin\u2019s chief investment officer for fixed-income.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking big steps where our fixed-income is going to have a competitive edge,\u201d she said.\n\nTech advancement alone won\u2019t salvage the money-management industry, according to Eric Jacobson, a senior analyst at Morningstar Inc.\n\n\u201cThis is the price of being in business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine such a thing as a silver bullet.\u201d\n\nThe question is whether change can come fast enough for Franklin\u2019s franchises in actively run international, value and income funds.\n\nHasenstab Slump\n\nThe Templeton Global Bond Fund, headed by high-profile manager Michael Hasenstab, trails more than 80% of peers this year, hurt by holdings in Argentina and a misplaced bet that long-term U.S. interest rates would rise. Assets dropped to $30 billion at the end of September, less than half their peak five years earlier.\n\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, Franklin\u2019s forte as a value investor has been challenged as growth stocks generated better results. That has put the firm on the defensive but it\u2019s not a reason to jump ship, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cOur job is to make sure the integrity of the investment process is pure and that value guys stick to value,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means giving them a little bit of air cover when they\u2019re getting beaten up.\u201d\n\nFranklin, which went public in 1971, expanded through key acquisitions such as the 1992 purchase of Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd. More recently the firm has been slow to change. It launched exchange-traded funds in 2014, long after rivals like State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group.\n\nStill, mergers and acquisitions aren\u2019t a cure-all for fund companies. The stocks of Invesco Ltd. and Janus Henderson Group Plc have fallen since those firms made major strategic deals.\n\nFranklin is looking for deals that would broaden its product lines, distribution capability or geographic footprint, Johnson said. Former Citigroup Inc. executive Matthew Nicholls started in May as chief financial officer with M&A bona fides cited in the hiring announcement.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Its business model is out of fashion.
