Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib \u2014 are endorsing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in his 2020 bid for the Democratic nomination.\n\nOcasio-Cortez will appear as a much-hyped \u201cspecial guest\u201d at a Sanders rally in New York City on Saturday, sources in the campaign confirmed to VICE News Tuesday night. After that news broke, Omar announced her endorsement of Sanders, although she won\u2019t appear at the rally. Tlaib will also back the campaign soon.\n\nFormer Ohio State Sen. Nina Turner, national co-chair of the Sanders campaign, confirmed Tuesday night that Ocasio-Cortez will be the special guest at the Queens rally \u2014 dubbed \u201cBernie\u2019s Back.\u201d It\u2019s the first rally Sanders has held since his campaign revealed that he suffered a heart attack a few weeks ago while on the campaign trail.\n\nSanders' progressive history has enabled candidates like Ocasio-Cortez to be unabashedly progressive on the national stage, Turner said. Now, Ocasio-Cortez can return the favor by lending Sanders some millennial energy.\n\n\"For all the haters who say that he's not a feminist enough, all the haters who say he's too old, she brings that youthfulness with her to complement what he already did in 2016,\" she told VICE News after the Democratic debate in Ohio. \"He already brings the thunder... This just takes him to the next level.\"\n\nThe liberal congresswomen, and Ocasio-Cortez especially, were considered prized endorsements and represent a well-timed win for Sanders, who has slipped to a consistent third place in the polls.\n\nREAD: Inside Bernie\u2019s fight to stay close in Iowa\n\nIn announcing her endorsement, Omar emphasized Sanders\u2019 commitment to fighting for working-class voters.\n\n\u201cBernie is leading a working-class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity, and geography,\u201d Omar said on Twitter. \u201cI know this from experience \u2014 I\u2019ve worked with him up close on bold, progressive reforms. I\u2019ve seen the values that motivate his fight for progress.\u201d\n\nIt's not yet clear if the fourth member of the Squad, Massachusetts Rep. Ayana Pressley, who hails from the same state as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, will endorse Sanders. She\u2019s noted in the past that the four members don\u2019t always agree.\n\n\u201cWe are not a monolith,\u201d she said in August. \u201cWe don\u2019t land in the same place on every vote. We are each our own people.\u201d\n\nBut the Sanders campaign left the door open for Pressley to back them eventually.\n\nWhen asked why the whole squad isn\u2019t endorsing, Turner said, \u201cYet.\u201d\n\nCover: In this July 15, 2019, file photo, from left, Rep.
