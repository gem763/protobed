Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, toured Pakistan with Prince William in October 2019. (Photo: Getty Images, WireImage)\n\nDuchess Kate's Pakistan style is bringing back memories of Princess Diana's visits to the country.\n\nKate's outfits-of-choice, which have focused on traditional ensembles and bold colors, appear to be inspired by the late royal, her mother-in-law.\n\nKate is in Pakistan with Prince William for a five-day official visit described as their \"most complex\" ever due to major logistical and security issues in a diplomatically touchy region. Diana also visited the country several times. She was friends with Prime Minister Imran Kahn, the former cricket superstar-turned-politician, who Will and Kate met with during Day 2 of the tour.\n\nFor her arrival to Pakistan, Kate wore a traditional shalwar kameez, an ombr\u00e9 turquoise dress and pants by Catherine Walker, plus cream-colored high heels.\n\nNot only is the color a nod to the outfit worn by William's late mother during her visit to Pakistan in 1996, so is the designer, who was one of Diana's favorites.\n\nPrincess Diana, right, in Pakistan in 1997.

In 1997, Diana wore a similarly colored ensemble. Both also wore a scarf and nude shoes.\n\nDuring the visit, Diana was brought up by a 14-year-old girl, who told the royal couple the students were \u201cbig fans\u201d of her, according to People and the Telegraph.\n\n\u201cYou were, really? Oh, that\u2019s very sweet of you. I was a big fan of my mother too,\" William replied. \"She came here three times. I was very small... This is my first time, and it is very nice to be here and meet you all.\u201d\n\nLater Tuesday, during Kate and William's meeting with Kahn and President of Pakistan Arif Alvi and his wife Samina Alvi, she wore a green tunic and trousers.\n\nLater, Kate Middleton wore emerald green tunic by Catherine Walker (one of Diana's favourite designers), cream trousers by Pakistan's @Maheenkhanpk, scarf by Satrangi & Zeen earrings. This attire reminded many Pakistanis of Princess Diana's 1991 visit #RoyalVisitPakistanpic.twitter.com/ob7TZzRFKx \u2014 Sana Jamal (@Sana_Jamal) October 15, 2019\n\nSocial media users were quick to draw comparisons between this ensemble and that of Diana's 1991 visit, where she also wore bright green and a darker green scarf.\n\nKate's tunic was again by Walker, one of Diana's favorite designers.\n\nThe Cambridge visit is intended to \"pay respect to the historical relationship\" between Britain and Pakistan, a Muslim country that used to be part of the British Empire with India, and from which more than 1 million British citizens today trace their ancestry.\n\nWill and Kate are embarking on this tour at a moment when public esteem for them is high in Britain, in contrast to the woes experienced in recent months by Prince Harry and his biracial American wife, Duchess Meghan of Sussex, who just returned from a 10-day tour of southern Africa with their baby, Archie.\n\nContributing: Maria Puente\n\nMore: Prince William and Duchess Kate arrive in Pakistan for their 'most complex tour' ever\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/15/duchess-kate-wears-princess-diana-inspired-outfits-pakistan/3983795002/", "description": "Duchess Kate's Pakistan style is bringing back memories of Princess Diana's visits, with looks seemingly inspired by Prince William's late mother.", "authors": ["Sara M Moniuszko", "Published A.M.
