But, if it is to be done, effort and skill is required in order to compare apples with apples,\" Mr Heffron said.\n\nThe Productivity Commission acknowledged the difficulties and its final report sought to deal with concerns raised by the industry.", "description": "ASIC denies trying to scare investors away from self-managed superannuation funds, after warning last week about the high cost and poor performance of funds worth less than $500,000.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8563%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_447%2C$y_78/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1fe470354a1294c199eda35daac668b8374054f3", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
