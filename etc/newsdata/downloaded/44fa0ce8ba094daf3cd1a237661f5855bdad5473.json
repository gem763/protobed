(Photo: RLJE Films)\n\nHorror is at its best when there\u2019s mythology behind the mayhem. That\u2019s why franchises like Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Saw, Halloween, and so many others endure. We love the scares but also the history and story of these evil characters.\n\nThat level of success is what most horror movies aspire to and it\u2019s certainly the goal of the new movie, Trick. How do we know? Because the trailer says so. It says the film, which stars Omar Epps, is the birth of a \u201chorror legend.\u201d Whether or not that\u2019s true remains to be seen, but watch the trailer and see what you think.\n\nCo-written and directed by Patrick Lussier (Drive Angry), Trick gives off a lot of familiar vibes, at least going by this trailer. Killing at a party feels like Scream, some of the booby traps feel like Saw, the killer\u2019s invincibility feels like Friday the 13th. We still don\u2019t know exactly what makes Trick different from all of those characters and others \u2014 but I must say, the trailer\u2019s confidence has me interested to find out.\n\nTrick hits VOD and digital on October 19.", "description": "Horror is at its best when there\u2019s mythology behind the mayhem.
