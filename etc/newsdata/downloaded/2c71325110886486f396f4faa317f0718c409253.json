Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was seen by the moderators and her fellow candidates as the one to beat.\n\nThat point was evident with time allotted to each candidate. Warren had the most with nearly 23 minutes to answer questions \u2013 or about equal to what the bottom three candidates mustered, according to The New York Times.\n\nThere were some advantages to that. John Harwood of CNBC proclaimed \u201cthis debate crowning Warren the new 2020 front-runner.\u201d\n\nCNN, NYT SLAMMED FOR AVOIDING CHINA DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'THIS IS LITERALLY A JOKE,' 'SHAMEFUL'\n\nBut former CBS News anchor Dan Rather said that \u201cthe stage is more crowded than a Times Square subway stop.\u201d And almost everyone on that stage was targeting Warren.\n\nIt didn\u2019t go well for the senator from Massachusetts. The regular attacks often turned her into a whiny scold.\n\nAs CNN anchor John King later explained: \u201cThe candidates on the stage clearly thought it was in their best interest to go after Warren.\u201d\n\nFormer CNN commentator Roland Martin said it even better, noting: \u201cHow do we know @ewarren is leading? She has a bullseye on her tonight.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post sold the debate with a headline sounding like it watched a far-more entertaining contest: \u201cWarren faces first sustained attack in raucous debate.\u201d At least it was right about the attacking.\n\nThe New York Times was more accurate in tone about the tedious three-hour marathon: \u201cWarren Draws Fire From All Sides, Reflecting a Shift in Fortunes in Race.\u201d\n\nCNN host Van Jones reflected on the attacks, calling Warren: \u201cMortal. Mortal. Somebody grabbed the cape and pulled on it.\u201d Jones explained that the \u201cmoderates\u201d struck back, \u201ctired of the woke-enomics.\u201d\n\nPBS White House Correspondent Yamiche Alcindor said it was a \u201cBIG MOMENT\u201d when the \u201cElizabeth Warren attacks begin.\u201d As she described it: \u201cWarren gives a tough stare\u201d after \u201cMayor Pete Buttigieg says to Warren: Your signature is to have a plan for everything except health care.\u201d\n\nEven far-left Hollywood director Michael Moore wasn\u2019t entirely happy with Warren\u2019s prescriptions for change. He said: \u201cSenator Warren (whom I love) just said she believes in \u2018accountable capitalism\u2019. There is no such thing. The only thing capitalism is accountable to is weath [sic] and more wealth for the wealthy. It\u2019s only mission is to economically enslave the citizenry so the rich can get richer.\u201d\n\nBut there was more to the debate than just attacks on Warren. There were also attacks on President Trump. Of course. CNN, which has done as much as any outlet in America to promote impeachment, began the entire debate with 12 questions on the subject \u2013 one easy one for each candidate.\n\nThe result was laughably predictable \u2013 all the candidates showed that they hate Trump. The Post\u2019s phrasing was a \u201cunified condemnation of Trump.\u201d Like no one saw that coming.\n\nNBC News Correspondent Mike Memoli called the beginning of the debate \u201ca moment of history,\u201d adding that \u201c1 participant may vote on articles of impeachment. 5 participants would sit as jurors in an impeachment trial.\u201d\n\nThis is sure to please the major media that not only hate Trump but have financial interests in the impeachment. Axios reported that news outlets are \u201cbuilding pop-up newsletters, podcasts, and sections solely to cover the day-to-day developments of the impeachment process.\u201d Those include Vox Media, CNN and The New York Times.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris of California scored one of the night\u2019s few applause lines and news outlets went with her extreme narrative backing abortion, after she said: \u201cAnd it is not an exaggeration to say women will die, poor women, women of color will die, because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies.\u201d\n\nThe debate was also predictably left-wing. Van Jones asked Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota a scary post-debate question for Democrats: \u201cAnd I wonder, are you afraid that the party is going in a direction that is just going to get us killed here in the middle of the country?\u201d Klobuchar responded about the party can \u201ccome together,\u201d but it\u2019s the kind of comment that will set the left and media worrying.\n\nAdd it to the amazingly quiet crowd. The Root\u2019s Politics Editor Jason Johnson called it \u201cthe quietest audience I've ever seen in a debate.\u201d Trump would have called that \u201clow energy.\u201d He\u2019d have been right.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nEven liberals weren\u2019t always happy with all the candidates, especially the newest entrant into the race. Vox Senior Correspondent Zack Beauchamp made fun of the billionaire who just joined the campaign, but who always seems to wear the same tie. \u201cWhile Tom Steyer wasted an unconscionable amount of money getting on stage and did absolutely nothing to justify his presence here, his tie is pretty good.\u201d\n\nBustle Deputy News Editor Catherine Thompson took her own shot at his debating style: \u201cTom Steyer is gesticulating and speaking like he\u2019s a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy carved out of wood.\u201d\n\nBut CNN had Steyer\u2019s back. It initially listed him as a \u201cformer hedge fund manager.\u201d That wasn\u2019t nice enough to a guy who buys so much TV advertising. So it somehow got changed to \u201cBusinessman.\u201d\n\nBecause CNN is neutral. And not in it for the money.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd Washington Post Opinion Writer Elizabeth Bruenig was equally critical of former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke after a few candidates were asked about their age. \u201ci mean look. yes, as you get older, your brain gets worse. but that's just a general trend. look at beto. he's very young and his brain is very bad.\u201d\n\nThere was one especially unusual highlight of the debate. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii bashed the \u201cmainstream media\u201d like she was running in the Republican primary. She explained that The \u201cNew York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war.\u201d Those news organizations were the two hosts of the debate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DAN GAINOR", "description": "While there was no clear winner in the debate featuring 12 Democratic presidential candidates Tuesday night, it was clear that Sen.
