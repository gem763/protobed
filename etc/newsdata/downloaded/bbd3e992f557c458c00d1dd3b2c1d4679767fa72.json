They are also urging an inquiry into where the money from the business has gone.\n\nShe blames the the management, saying: \"These people are supposed to be the best at what they do and they've let us all down.\"\n\n\"We need answers from them and - if there is something that isn't quite right - accountability for it.\"\n\nImage caption Al White marched past Parliament with other former Thomas Cook staff.\n\nFormer Cabin manager Al White says he is angry that the firm's boss, Peter Fankhauser, was paid \u00a38.3m in his five years at the top.\n\n\"We haven't got any money, we're literally just relying on friends, family [and] savings,\" he says.\n\n\"[Mr Fankhauser's] ok, we're not.\"\n\nShortly before it went under, Thomas Cook turned to the UK government for a \u00a3250m rescue package. But the government turned it down arguing that the troubled travel company would not survive even with a bailout.\n\nBut Mr White thinks that was a mistake.\n\n\"If we'd been bailed out we could have paid money back like it was when the government bailed the banks out.\"\n\nInstead, he says, that the government will now pick up a large share of the bill for repatriating holidaymakers and reimbursing travellers whose holidays have been cancelled.\n\nImage caption Alessandro Rossinelli is worried that Thomas Cook's failure may hurt his new wife's visa application.\n\nFormer cabin crew member, Alessandro Rossinelli, said \u00a3250m was \"peanuts\" for the government, while 9,000 families were affected by the collapse.\n\nHe got married earlier this year and fears that, without a job, he may not be able to sponsor his new wife's application for a UK visa.\n\n\"I support her so I don't know if\u2026 they'll reject it,\" he says.\n\nImage caption Jo Cooke and Colleen Gibson say they believed assurances from Thomas Cook management that the firm would survive.\n\nFormer store manager Jo Cooke worries that she misled customers about the health of the company in the days before it collapsed.\n\nHer colleague Colleen Gibson said they were told there would be \"a lot of noise\", but that \"it would be OK\".\n\n\"I don't know if we were just gullible or naive but we really believed that.\"\n\nIn a statement, the government said: \"The collapse of Thomas Cook is devastating for those who have lost their jobs and affected holidaymakers and the government will do all it can to support them.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately a government bailout would not have solved the company's problems, which are well-documented.\"\n\nThomas Cook staff have been told to apply for their salary and redundancy related payments from the Insolvency Service's Redundancy Payment Service (RPS).\n\nThe Insolvency Service has said claims would be paid within 14 days of receipt of information, but \"special arrangements are being put in place to pay sooner if practicable to do so\".", "description": "Crew and shop workers are borrowing from friends and family to pay bills after the firm's collapse.", "authors": ["Dan Ascher", "Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16266/production/_109062709_abi.jpg"}
