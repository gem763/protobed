Pogrebin and Kelly said they \u201ccorroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with\u201d Stier.\n\nWhat Stier said he witnessed is similar to an allegation lodged against Kavanaugh by his former classmate Deborah Ramirez, which was first reported by the New Yorker\u2019s Ronan Farrow last September.\n\nTwo @nytimes reporters, @rpogrebin and @katekelly, spent months independently reporting out Deborah Ramirez\u2019s allegation against Brett Kavanaugh and found it credible\u2014and documented another serious claim of misconduct with an eyewitness: https://t.co/XquETEtHI1 \u2014 Ronan Farrow (@RonanFarrow) September 15, 2019\n\nRamirez said that she was at a dorm room party with Kavanaugh and several others playing a drinking game when Kavanaugh pulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her. She pushed him away, she told the New Yorker last year, causing her to touch his penis.\n\nRamirez came forward with her accusations last September after Christine Blasey Ford publicly accused the then-Supreme Court nominee of drunkenly pinning her to a bed and trying to take off her clothes until she broke free and left while they were in high school.\n\nPogrebin and Kelly looked into both Ramirez\u2019s and Ford\u2019s claims for their upcoming book, which takes a deeper look into Kavanaugh\u2019s prep-school and Ivy League days in an attempt to piece together who he is, according to a summary.\n\nIn their investigation, the Times reporters said they talked to at least seven people who heard of Ramirez\u2019 account \u201clong before Mr. Kavanaugh was a federal judge,\u201d including two former Yale students who learned of it days after it allegedly occurred.\n\nWe have deleted an earlier tweet to this article that was poorly phrased. https://t.co/wwEm8HHkwT pic.twitter.com/4PJNaWEpfP \u2014 New York Times Opinion (@nytopinion) September 15, 2019\n\nWhile promoting Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s work, the New York Times\u2019 opinion section posted a tweet that was meant to promote Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s work but instead appeared dismissive of sexual harassment.\n\nThe tweet suggested that \u201chaving a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun.\u201d\n\nThe Times deleted the tweet after people pointed out that sexual harassment should never be deduced down to \u201charmless\u201d or \u201cfun.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have deleted an earlier tweet to this article that was poorly phrased,\u201d the paper\u2019s social media retraction said.\n\nLove to log into Twitter after the first episode of Unbelievable triggered a panic attack to see this now-deleted but very, very, very bad New York Times tweet.\n\n\n\nI am so tired. https://t.co/2HMCaFflTi \u2014 Caitlin Tremblay (@ctrembz) September 14, 2019\n\nLove HuffPost?
