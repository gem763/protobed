That's more than 5 times his previous auction record.\n\nThese might be highbrow prices, but they are not highbrow paintings. \u201cThe Kaws Album\u201d and \u201cDevolved Parliament\u201d are not-very-funny, one-note jokes, while \u201cKnife Behind Back\u201d is an oversized cartoon figure. Art gadfly Kenny Schachter has given this trend a name: \"infantilism.\"\n\nWhy these artworks are so expensive: Part of the reason is relatively mundane: All 3 canvases are old-fashioned paintings, and all of them are unusually large.\n\nThere's also supply and demand. These artists have large fan bases, and the top 0.01% of those fan bases will want to own strikingly large unique works. All you need is 2 rich collectors duking it out in an auction room for a single piece, and a crazy new record is set.\n\nSimplicity sells. In the modern era, each successive generation of artists has generally become easier to understand and appreciate.\n\nTake an old master: Try to unpack the layers and craftsmanship in \u201cLas Meninas\u201d by Vel\u00e1zquez.\n\nTry to unpack the layers and craftsmanship in \u201cLas Meninas\u201d by Vel\u00e1zquez.

The \u201cdifficulty level\u201d has clearly gone down, not up. Then fast-forward to Pollock\u2019s drip paintings, Warhol\u2019s Marilyns, and finally the cartoonish stylings of Jeff Koons or Meow Wolf. Each is simpler, more universal, more easily grokked, more exportable than the last. You need less and less specific cultural context or connoisseurship to appreciate these works.\n\nThe bottom line: As the world of art collectors has expanded and globalized, the minimum level of sophistication that an artwork needs in order to fetch 8 figures at auction has clearly been falling.\n\nGo deeper: The art of ocean trash", "description": "The painting is a decade old, but more timely than ever.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/H6-9ryNjhLQ8S8K0H3tiq_01MXs=/0x0:2443x1374/1920x1080/2019/10/10/1570740087339.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
