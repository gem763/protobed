Semenya won\u2019t be present for any ceremony in Doha after she was barred from defending her latest 800-meter world title because she has refused to follow new IAAF rules that require her to medically reduce her natural testosterone level to be allowed to compete.\n\nHer second legal appeal against the rules is still being considered by the Swiss supreme court.\n\nAthletics South Africa says it will decide on an appropriate event to hand the medal to Semenya in South Africa.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Caster Semenya is finally getting her gold medal from the 2011 world championships after Russian runner Maria Savinova was stripped of the title for doping.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/semenya_soccer_team_02743_c0-56-3833-2290_s1770x1032.jpg?336896a836429a88d91889fc79f20c7259e1d5b8", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
