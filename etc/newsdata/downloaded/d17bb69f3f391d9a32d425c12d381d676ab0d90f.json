Do you need to tackle your debts once and for all? Or could you be making more of your everyday spending?\n\nWhatever you are thinking of doing, if it is going to involve a credit card, then it is essential that you get the right one.\n\nChoose the right deal and you can clear your debts faster, spread the cost of an expensive purchase and even earn a tidy sum in airline points, cashback or rewards.\n\nPick the wrong one, however, or fail to manage it correctly and you can be left with a hefty bill, and a credit rating in tatters.\n\nPlay your cards right: This is Money has rounded up the best credit card offers\n\nThis is Money has scoured the market and picked out what we believe are the best credit card deals to help you make the most of your money.\n\nWe pick these because we think that they offer something that makes them stand out from the crowd, they may not always have the absolute lowest rate or longest special offer, but they are judged by our independent research to offer a good deal.\n\nDo you need to clear existing debt? Before you think about signing up for a new card to use for spending, you should make sure that your existing debts are in order. If you\u2019ve racked up a load of debt and have decided to make a fresh start on tackling it, zero per cent balance transfer cards could be the way to go. Moving your debt to an interest-free card means that you can freeze the size of your debt, rather than continually play catch-up as interest piles on the pounds. Make sure you stick to the rules though and clear your debt within the time period, otherwise you could be hit with high interest rates - and remember card firms offer interest-free periods because they manage to catch so many people out. The right balance transfer card for you depends on your circumstances, so rather than recommend one 'best' option here, we would instead recommend readers go to our in-depth guide to 0 per cent balance transfer cards for the best deal.\n\nBest credit cards for spending on big purchases\n\nInterest-free spending\n\nIf you\u2019re planning some home improvements or large purchases in the near future and need some extra cash for spending, as long as you are confident you can pay off the full amount within 24 months or slightly longer to avoid high interest rates , a 0 per cent purchase card could be a good option for you.\n\nRemember, you will need to be disciplined about clearing the balance before the end of the term, otherwise interest on the remaining amount will quickly make it an expensive option.\n\nBefore you apply, read more about how to avoid the 0 per cent interest traps here\n\nLONGEST INTEREST-FREE PURCHASE CREDIT CARDS Top deals Purchase offer Extras Standard APR MBNA 27 27 months 0% balance transfers (2.69% handling fee), 12 months 0% interest on money transfers (4% handling fee) 20.93 Tesco Bank 26 months Clubcard rewards points for spending 19.9% Sainsbury's Bank Nectar Purchase card 25 months 25 months 0% balance transfers, 3% fee, Nectar points for spending, Up to 7,500 point bonus in first 2 months. 20.9% Barclaycard 25 months 25 months 0% interest on balance transfers, 2.7% fee for transfers. 19.9% M&S Bank 20 months 20 months 0% interest on balance transfers (2.9% fee), M&S points on spending, \u00a35 in points on first spend in stores 19.9% Virgin Money 20 months 23 months 0 per cent on balance transfers with a 2% fee. 23 months 0% on money transfers (4% fee) 21.9% Correct as of September 11 2019\n\nCould you be better with a long-term low rate instead?\n\nIf you are happy to sidestep a 0 per cent interest period, another credit card option for anyone wanting to take the pressure off paying within a set time period is a permanent low-interest card.\n\nUnfortunately these cards are not as good as they once were, however you can still find low interest deals closer to 9 or 10 per cent, rather than the typical 19 or 20 per cent found.\n\nThese give the flexibility of knowing that you have a card to hand to spread big purchases out, without worrying about falling foul of any small print.\n\nProtecting your money Another major bonus with rewards cards is the consumer protection you are entitled to, under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Put simply, if you use the credit card to buy something worth more than \u00a3100, here or abroad, the card issuer is equally liable if something goes wrong.\n\nMissing payments, paying late or spending beyond your limit risk losing an interest-free term which can quickly land you in hot water when standard interest at 18 or 19 per cent is slapped on your remaining balance.\n\nThe benefit is that if you decide not to pay off the entire balance every month, you will only have to pay minimal interest.\n\nYou must have a good credit rating to be approved.\n\nLloyds Bank, Halifax, Bank of Scotland and American Express all offer cards with an APR of 9.9 per cent.\n\nLloyds Bank, Halifax and Bank of Scotland also have the benefit of offering no-fee balance transfers. Alternatively the American Express card offers rewards points on spending under its Membership Rewards scheme plus 2,500 points if you spend \u00a31,000 on the card within the first thee months.\n\nMembership Rewards points can be swapped for airline points with many popular schemes including with BA, Virgin and Emirates or cashed in for vouchers from retailers such as Amazon or M&S.\n\nCheck out this is Money's favourite low-rate credit card here\n\nBest credit cards for rewards\n\nOver recent years some of the most lucrative schemes have unfortunately been scrapped or scaled back.\n\nBut there are still a few cards that if you do it right, could earn you \u00a3100s worth of goods and services for free.\n\nRemember: Each company operates under their own points system, so make sure you check what each point is actually worth \u2013 something that may appear to offer huge bonuses could in reality be almost worthless.\n\nBelow we have picked a few of our favourites, alternatively read more about all of the top deals in our in depth guide:\n\nTravel rewards: pay with a credit card to get deals on trips\n\nBest for airline points: British Airways American Express Premium Plus Card\n\nYour choice of rewards card will largely depend on which airlines you prefer because a combination of credit card and frequent flyer points are going to get you the best discounts.\n\nHowever, if you are a big spender, the British Airways Premium Plus Amex card is one of the most lucrative deals on the market.\n\n>Read out top five tips on boosting your Avios points pot without spending any more\n\nWhat do you get?\n\nThe major crowdpleaser is the free companion ticket if you spend more than \u00a310,000 a year - remember you still have to foot the bill for taxes, fees and charges though.\n\nThe sign-up bonuses are good, too.
