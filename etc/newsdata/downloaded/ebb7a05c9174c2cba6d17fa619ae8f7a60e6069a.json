REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo\n\nNissan, which has struggled to right itself after former chairman Carlos Ghosn was ousted late last year, was battered by another crisis just days ago when Saikawa admitted to being overpaid in violation of internal procedures. The admission followed the results of an internal investigation.\n\nNissan\u2019s board members are scheduled to meet on Monday to discuss the issue. The company, and its relationship with top shareholder Renault SA (RENA.PA), has been damaged following Ghosn\u2019s arrest in November and subsequent departure.\n\nCiting unnamed sources, the Nikkei said Saikawa\u2019s decision had been prompted by increasing doubts over his ability to steer the automaker to recovery, given the recent plunge in Nissan\u2019s profit and the salary payments.\n\nNissan was not immediately available to comment on the report.\n\nPressure has mounted on Saikawa, a Ghosn protege, given the company\u2019s poor performance and strained ties with Renault. Profit has tumbled to an 11-year low and prompted hefty job cuts.\n\nOne alliance source told Reuters that a nominations committee established in June to find a successor to Saikawa had drawn up a shortlist containing more than 10 possible candidates.\n\nNames included Jun Seki, who is overseeing the company\u2019s performance recovery, Chief Competitive Officer Yasuhiro Yamauchi, and Makoto Uchida, chairman of Nissan\u2019s management committee in China, one of its largest markets, the person said on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe search and vetting process would likely take about six months as the committee considered both Japanese and non-Japanese candidates for the role, another person with knowledge of the issue has told Reuters.\n\nThe Financial Times has reported that Nissan\u2019s board will set a formal succession timetable at Monday\u2019s meeting, citing unnamed sources.", "description": "Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa has told some executives he plans to resign, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Sunday, in what would mark the latest upheaval over governance at the troubled Japanese automaker.", "authors": ["Chang-Ran Kim", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427612580&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870MA", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
