The president had long looked to discredit Mueller\u2019s investigation, which found that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential elections to help Trump\u2019s campaign. It also shows Trump\u2019s desire to involve Barr in such requests, a move that comes on top of Democrats\u2019 accusations that the attorney general is working for the president and not for the U.S.\n\nBarr, who was appointed in December, launched the Justice Department\u2019s review of the Russia investigation earlier this year to find out whether the FBI or intelligence officials acted inappropriately to investigate whether Trump\u2019s campaign worked with Russia to meddle in the 2016 election.\n\nSoon after the Times report was published, The Washington Post reported that Barr has been personally holding private meetings abroad with foreign intelligence officials in multiple countries to request help with the Justice Department\u2019s review of the Mueller probe.\n\nAccording to the Post, Barr has already reached out to British intelligence officials and last week met senior Italian officials to ask them to assist U.S. Attorney John Durham, a Trump appointee whom Barr had assigned to lead the review. The requests were similar to the Australia request, the newspaper reported.\n\nDurham \u201cis gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries,\u201d Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec told HuffPost.\n\nAccording to Kupec, the president contacted other countries to ask them to introduce Barr and Durham to appropriate officials \u201cat Attorney General Barr\u2019s request.\u201d The attorney general is appointed by and works under the president.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Hogan Gidley told HuffPost in a statement that the Justice Department \u201csimply requested that the President provide introductions to facilitate\u201d the department\u2019s review of the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember when Democrats actually wanted to find out what happened in the 2016 election,\u201d Gidley said. \u201cThe Democrats clearly don\u2019t want the truth to come out anymore as it might hurt them politically, but this call relates to a DOJ inquiry publicly announced months ago to uncover exactly what happened.\u201d\n\nIn Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, the U.S. president pressured the newly elected Ukrainian leader to do him a \u201cfavor\u201d by working with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Barr to investigate potential 2020 rival and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. That call came just after Trump suspended nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine.\n\nA bombshell complaint by a whistleblower within the intel community alleged that White House officials moved the transcript of that call to a secret server used for classified information.\n\nTrump spoke to Morrison at Barr\u2019s request, according to the Justice Department. The call with Australia reportedly came just weeks after Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky.\n\nAustralia has ties to the Mueller probe because the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation began after Australian officials told the bureau that the Russian government made an offer to the Trump campaign about releasing dirt on Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s 2016 Democratic rival.\n\nAustralian officials told the FBI about the offer after the country\u2019s top diplomat in Britain met with George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, who told the diplomat that he was told Russia had thousands of stolen emails that would politically damage Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nAs the Times reported, Trump\u2019s recent request to Australia was basically asking the country to investigate itself.\n\n#breaking from federal government spokesperson: \"The Australian Government has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation. The PM confirmed this readiness once again in conversation with the President.\" \u2014 Andrew Greene (@AndrewBGreene) September 30, 2019\n\nA spokesperson for Australia\u2019s government told the country\u2019s ABC network and Sky News that Morrison did speak on the phone about the investigation with Trump.\n\n\u201cThe Australian Government has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation,\u201d the spokesperson reportedly said. \u201cThe PM confirmed this readiness once again in conversation with the President.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated with comments from the White House and the Australian government.", "description": "The president contacted other countries to help investigate the Mueller probe's origins \"at Attorney General Barr's request,\" according to the Justice De...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9265572100005b00fe589e.jpeg?cache=7aaqcmzx3q&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
