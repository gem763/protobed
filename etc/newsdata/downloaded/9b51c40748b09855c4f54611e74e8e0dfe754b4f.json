Dan Fuss, the vice chairman of Loomis Sayles and longtime portfolio manager of its flagship bond fund, meets that criteria \u2014 and he offered up four pieces of career wisdom when Business Insider spoke to him.\n\nSome of Fuss' tips are attitude-based, and some deal with how to actually perform within a job. In the end, he's just trying to help you last as long in your chosen career as he has. Good luck.\n\nIf Fuss occupies the institutional side of the spectrum, Andrew Aziz is carrying the flag for retail investors everywhere. Formerly a chemical engineer and Ph.D., he has no official training in the investing field. But that hasn't stopped him from formulating his own set of rules \u2014 ones that have allowed him to make a full-fledged career out of day-trading.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Business Insider, Aziz laid out the distinct three-step approach that's allowed him to leave behind the engineering world.

He spoke with Business Insider about these \"third wave\" tech companies.\n\nWATCH HERE >>\n\nWall Street has fallen in love with stocks that pay big dividends, and Goldman says they're still the cheapest in a decade. Here are the 13 the firm recommends most.\n\nIt's a popular time to recommend stocks that pay hefty dividends, since so many people are worried about an imminent market pullback and trying to get defensive.\n\nGoldman Sachs strategist Cole Hunter agrees with this approach, and is particularly fond of companies offering significant dividend growth. To sweeten the pot even more, Hunter notes that many of these stocks are undervalued. We list his 13 top picks.\n\nREAD MORE HERE >>\n\nA college professor studied 70,000 households and found Americans need emergency savings of only $2,467. Here's why she's suggesting a mere fraction of what other experts recommend.\n\nWhat if you've been thinking about your emergency savings fund all wrong? Business Insider spoke to a college professor who says that might be the case.\n\nThat would be Emily Gallagher, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Colorado Boulder. She found that roughly one month of income \u2014 or $2,467 \u2014 is the minimum emergency buffer an average low-income household should hold.\n\nThat's far below what experts have been suggesting for decades.
