This summer, cases of the potentially deadly virus have been reported in states across the country, such as Rhode Island, Michigan, and, most recently, Connecticut.\n\nBut a number of human EEE cases have also been reported in Massachusetts, which has been hit particularly hard with the virus this year. Health officials there recently confirmed yet another resident has been infected with EEE, marking the state\u2019s eighth human case this year.\n\nOn average, five to 10 cases of EEE are reported each year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says.\n\nMASSACHUSETTS WOMAN REPORTEDLY DIES FROM RARE MOSQUITO-BORNE VIRUS: 'SHE WAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SOUL'\n\nMosquitoes become infected with EEE after feeding on an infected bird \u2014 specifically those that live in freshwater swamps. Typically, EEE-carrying mosquitos are only found where the EEE-infected birds are. But on occasion, according to the Connecticut Department of Public Health, \u201cthe virus gets picked up by other types of mosquitoes that bite other birds, animals, and people\u201d \u2014 thus creating a \u201cbridge\u201d between the virus and humans, so to speak.\n\nDr. Catherine Brown, the Massachusetts state epidemiologist, told LiveScience that birds from Florida \u2014 which has long dealt with EEE \u2014 migrate to New England each year, specifically to a state with a particularly dense population of red maple and white cedar swamps: Massachusetts.\n\nThough a particular species of mosquito in the swamps feeds on the infected birds, other types of mosquitoes occasionally feed on the birds and subsequently become carriers. Those mosquitoes then pass the virus to humans and other mammals \u2014 namely to horses, which, according to the CDC, are particularly susceptible. (Humans and mammals are considered to be \u201cdead-end\u201d hosts, however, and the virus doesn\u2019t spread from animal to animal, human to human, animal to human, or vice versa.)\n\nAfter a couple of years, the birds infected with EEE build an immunity to the virus, according to LiveScience. When this happens, the transmission isn\u2019t as effective, resulting in a decline in EEE cases.\n\nAs the birds reproduce, however, the eggs hatch and the older, immune birds eventually die off. The younger birds without immunity are susceptible to EEE, and the cycle begins again, Brown explained. Sometimes the migrating birds carry a strain of EEE the other birds are not immune to, which further perpetuates the cycle.\n\n\u201cTaken together, these factors cause outbreaks in Massachusetts every 10 to 20 years, and these can last for several years,\u201d LiveScience reports.\n\nEEE \u201cis one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis),\u201d the CDC says. The virus is more common in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states, though the Great Lakes area has also seen cases.\n\nSymptoms of EEE usually appear four to 10 days after a person is bitten by an infected mosquito. Severe cases of the virus \u201cbegin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting,\u201d said the CDC, which noted, \u201cthe illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, and coma.\u201d\n\nRHODE ISLAND SEES FIRST EEE DEATH SINCE 2007, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nOne-third of those infected with EEE virus die; survivors typically have \u201cmild to severe brain damage.\u201d There\u2019s no specific treatment for the infection.\n\nMassachusetts health officials on Monday announced they are continuing to spray for mosquitoes \u2014 specifically in areas of the state considered to be at an increased risk for the virus, according to a statement.\n\nThe best way to prevent EEE virus and other mosquito-borne ailments is by draining standing water \u2014 like in birdbaths, buckets or on pool covers \u2014 as stagnant water can serve as a breeding ground for these insects. Other preventive measures include covering skin with long-sleeved pants and shirts while outside and properly using DEET-containing insect repellent.", "description": "Why Massachusetts may be seeing an unusually high number of EEE cases this year.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
