FYI you can't get type 1 diabetes from eating too much sugar. It is an autoimmune disease and is controlled by numerous blood testing and daily insulin injections. Do your research,.;\n\nAnother commented: 'I didn't watch GBBO however it was powerful to watch the #DOC rise in response to an ignorant and misinformed throwaway comment by Paul Hollywood.\n\n'What is making my blood boil is that Channel 4 is not live, and this could and should definitely been cut out.'\n\nDoes sugar cause diabetes? Diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high. There are two main types of diabetes \u2013 Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In Type 1 diabetes, the insulin producing cells in your pancreas are destroyed by your immune system. No amount of sugar in your diet \u2013 or anything in your lifestyle \u2013 has caused or can cause you to get Type 1 diabetes. With Type 2 diabetes, though we know sugar doesn\u2019t directly cause Type 2 diabetes, you are more likely to get it if you are overweight. You gain weight when you take in more calories than your body needs, and sugary foods and drinks contain a lot of calories. So you can see if too much sugar is making you put on weight, then you are increasing your risk of getting Type 2 diabetes. But Type 2 diabetes is complex, and sugar is unlikely to be the only reason the condition develops. Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. In the UK, around 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2. Source: Diabetes UK\n\nAnother wrote: 'Diabetes is not a punchline.
