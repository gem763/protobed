This latest effort debuted at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, and stars Armie Hammer as a New Orleans bartender who really gets himself into trouble when he takes home a cellphone that some rowdy patrons left behind. Turns out there\u2019s some horrible stuff in that phone, and it\u2019s going to have a hand in ruining the lives of him and his wife (Dakota Johnson). Zazie Beetz is also there, possibly drawing Armie\u2019s eye away from his marriage \u2014 so honestly, maybe he deserves those open sores appearing on his body and the sudden swarm of cockroaches taking over. Wounds starts streaming on Hulu October 18.\n\nRelated", "description": "Dakota Johnson, Zazie Beetz, and Armie Hammer star in the trailer for the horror movie Wounds, from Under the Shadow director Babak Anvari.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/24/24-wound.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
