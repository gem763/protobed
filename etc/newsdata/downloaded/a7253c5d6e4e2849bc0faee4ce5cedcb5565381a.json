None of the games matter.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt may seem like that \u2014 and sure, there is way less importance accompanying most baseball games as opposed to games in other sports \u2014 but it\u2019s an endurance race. It\u2019s built on series and series of series. It\u2019s testing depth. Stamina. Mental toughness and physical toughness. It\u2019s testing its participants\u2019 ability to adapt on the fly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one guy throwing to the other guy over and over with the same view all the time.\u201d\n\nI get that, but if you pay attention you learn that what you should really be watching for is a sequence of pitches with early pitches setting up later pitches while the batter and pitcher are each trying to out-think the other. There\u2019s so much going on in each at bat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just boring. There\u2019s no excitement.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll grant that no one is putting a bone-crunching hit someone, jumping, or sprinting frantically at almost any given time you pay attention, but that\u2019s not where baseball\u2019s excitement comes from. Baseball is all about slowly building tension. About how what happened two innings ago affects what\u2019s happening now. About how what happened yesterday has bearing on today. About how a hundred small things result in one big thing later. About how, at some point, be it in the fourth, sixth, or ninth inning, you realize that everything prior has led to this and now, suddenly, everything is on the line.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd then you reach a point where the past six games, the past three series, and the past eight months \u2014 which began among the cactuses and the grapefruit, when a dozen teams or more thought they had a path to a championship \u2014 have led to one evening when only two teams remain standing. You get to a point where, despite the fact that the first five games seemed sort of a listless drag at times, everything suddenly picks up. The point where, suddenly, in hindsight, everything that came before mattered, made sense and built us up to a level where everything is exciting and everything is at stake.\n\nGame 7 of the World Series. There\u2019s nothing like it. And here we are.\n\nThe Game: World Series Game 7: Washington Nationals vs. Houston Astros\n\nThe Time: 8:07 PM Eastern\n\nThe Ballpark: Minute Maid Park, Houston, Texas\n\nThe Network: Fox\n\nThe Starters: Max Scherzer vs. Zack Greinke\n\nThe Upshot:\n\nLater this morning, a man will place a very important phone call. That man is Max Scherzer, and the phone call, we are told, will be placed to his boss, Dave Martinez, soon after Scherzer has woken up. During that phone call Scherzer will tell Martinez whether or not his neck locked up with spasms again as it did as he slept on Saturday night, preventing him from pitching in Sunday\u2019s Game 5. If it has not, Scherzer will pitch tonight.\n\nScherzer was confident last night that everything would be fine. He received a cortisone shot and some chiropractic work that seems to have solved his problem and he feels good enough to pitch. He\u2019ll get the start \u2014 having now received seven full days\u2019 rest \u2014 and if he falters a fully-rested An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, Saturday\u2019s starter Patrick Corbin, and closer Sean Doolittle will be, in one order or another, the first three men out of the bullpen to relieve him. No team wants to lose three World Series games and no team wants to try to have to win a Game 7 in a hostile environment, but the Nationals are set up about as well as they possibly could be to do the improbable and knock off the heavily favored Houston Astros and win the World Series.\n\nHouston, of course, is not coming into this final battle unarmed. By the time late July rolled around there was no doubt whatsoever that the Astros were going to win the AL West and be playing in October. As such, their deadline acquisition of Zack Greinke from the Arizona Diamondbacks was not really about August and September. They had one of the best offenses in baseball and the top two starters in the American League already under their employ. Picking up Greinke was about winning a seven-game series when you have to have three starters. Greinke has been overshadowed a bit by both his teammates and the Nats\u2019 starters during this series, but he\u2019s also coming off nine innings of work over his previous two starts in which he has allowed only two runs while striking out 11 batters. He remains an ace who most any team would want starting a Game 7.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Tickets for tonight? Click here\n\nAnd, it\u2019s worth noting, that he won\u2019t be alone. Much was made of Gerrit Cole pitching what was thought to be his final game as an Astro in Game 5 on Sunday night, but there is every reason to believe that he\u2019ll be up and getting ready in the bullpen tonight the first moment there is any trouble for Greinke. He won\u2019t be able to go long, but he\u2019ll be able to throw triple-digit heat for at least an inning and maybe more. If the Nats are to win this, they\u2019ll have to get through not just one but two of the best pitchers in all of baseball.\n\nAt this point we\u2019re out of analysis. The Astros are laden with talent and have a lineup stocked with guys who can change a game with one swing of the bat. The Nationals have been in four elimination games so far this October: the Wild Card game, Game 4 and Game 5 of the NLDS, and Game 6 last night. They trailed in all four of them and won all four of them. Last night their two most important position players \u2014 Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto \u2014 came back to life.\n\nTonight we have the icy-calm Greinke vs. the fiery Max Scherzer. We have an offensive powerhouse vs. a lineup containing two guys who have risen to the occasion and who are unfazed by the bright lights of the postseason. We made it through a month and a half of spring training, a six-month slog through the regular season and an intense, month-long march through October to get us to where we will be at 8PM tonight.\n\nWelcome to the final day of the 2019 season of the greatest damn sport there is.", "description": "Game 7.
