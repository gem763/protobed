They were very wrong and will now pay the price for their actions.\"\n\nChristina Smith of the CPS said: \"These two rapists have at every turn denied responsibility for their sickening actions.\n\n\"They took advantage of a vulnerable woman, who had clearly lost the capacity to consent to sexual activity.\n\n\"They ushered her into a room, raped her, discarded her and then ran away from the scene of their crime in callous celebration.\n\n\"The victim has shown immense courage in coming forward and we hope these convictions provide her with some comfort.\n\n\"We hope this serves as a very strong reminder that anyone who takes advantage of another who, for whatever reason, is unable to consent faces prosecution for their actions.\"\n\nOrlando and Lorenzo were both convicted of two counts of rape each and will return for sentencing on a date to be set.", "description": "WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT.
