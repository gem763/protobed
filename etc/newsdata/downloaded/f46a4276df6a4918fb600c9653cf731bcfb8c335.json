An analysis by the group, which represents mostly industry super funds on environmental, social and governance issues, shows that ASX 100 chief executive pay hit a record for the second successive year in 2018. And only one did not pick up a bonus.\n\nCEO pay has risen -- but so have the returns they create. Shutterstock\n\nBonuses are still being viewed as entitlement, and pay held at risk is really at little risk, warns ACSI\u2019s chief executive Louise Davidson, who claims continued over-indulgence on pay is a \u201cfailure of leadership and discipline\u201d.\n\nBut what about the leadership and discipline with which the 10 best paid CEOs delivered a 432.7 per cent rise in shareholder returns in the past five years (as The Australian Financial Review reported yesterday)? Most of those returns went to millions of Australian super savers that ASCI\u2019s members ultimately represent.\n\nAn analysis by PwC found that more than a third of CEOs had their base pay frozen last year, so that pay really does come down to earnings at risk. Few people, apart from Alan Joyce, the highest paid CEO, could have pulled off one of the biggest turnarounds in aviation history at Qantas. And few other than the now-retired Nicholas Moore, the second highest paid and only banker in the top 10, would have begun building Macquarie into a funds management powerhouse when the rest of the world\u2019s financial sector was fighting for its life. ACSI has gone for the headlines with a superficial, populist-inspired list, when the full story is so much more interesting.", "description": "Chief executive pay is high but so is the wealth for savers that they create.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2119%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2f3bb039aadfd2a27d5c22702fdcfefaea77580f", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
