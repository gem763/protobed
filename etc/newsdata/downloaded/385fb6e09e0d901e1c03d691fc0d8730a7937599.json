Customers could come to the warehouse and allegedly build their own rifles \u201cfor about $1,000.\u201d\n\nRoh allegedly maintained his business, even after ATF officials warned him \u2018in person\u2026that he was breaking the law.\u201d\n\nRoh was eventually indicted, only to have federal authorities drop charges after prosecutors grew worried that a ruling in the case would be detrimental to the larger gun control system. They specifically worried the 1968 Gun Control Act could be endangered and that a trial might \u201cseriously undermine the ATF\u2019s ability to trace and regulate firearms nationwide.\u201d\n\nHe sold guns to felons, abusers, and prohibited persons. The Feds let him go to avoid hurting gun control efforts. NRA has always fought for the FULL PROSECUTION of gun criminals \u2013 no plea bargaining, no parole, and definitely not just letting someone off.https://t.co/5RBKJvOgUG \u2014 NRA (@NRA) October 13, 2019\n\nA trial to prosecute Roh would have brought attention to the fact that the ATF regulates AR-15s based not on the entire firearm, but on one part\u2013the lower\u2013which holds the trigger and hammer mechanism. The lower is like a command control center for firing bullets. Prosecutors feared the judgement in the case against Roh might somehow undermine the ATF\u2019s regulation, thereby rendering numerous gun controls moot.\n\nMoreover, \u201c80 percent\u201d lowers are available in numerous state and do not count as firearms in those states because they are unfinished and, therefore, cannot hold the trigger and hammer mechanism. These lowers are usable after the remaining 20 percent of work is done to finish them. Roh\u2019s case would have also drawn attention to these lowers and their relationship to the Second Amendment.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
