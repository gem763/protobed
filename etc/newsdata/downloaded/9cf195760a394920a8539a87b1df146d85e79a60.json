Protesters have been using masks to shield their identities and to protect their faces from police tear gas.\n\nThe rallies spiraled into some of the most violent clashes since protests started four months ago, forcing the unprecedented shut down of the city's metro after many stations were torched and scores of shops and China banks damaged.\n\n\n\n\n\nECONOMY FACES 'SEVERE WINTER'\n\nSunday night saw the first interaction between protesters and Chinese troops stationed in the territory, which have so far remained in barracks. Protesters targeted a military barracks with laser pointers prompting troops to hoist a banner warning them they could be arrested. Senior ranking People's Liberation Army officers have said violence will not be tolerated.\n\nHong Kong police said on Tuesday 77 people had been arrested for violating the anti-mask law. Since Friday, more than 200 shops and public utilities have been damaged in the unrest and police have fired 367 tear gas rounds, said a police spokesman.\n\nWhat started as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has grown into a pro-democracy movement against what is seen as Beijing's tightening grip on the city, which protesters say undermines a \"one country, two systems\" formula promised when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule.\n\nChina dismisses such accusations, saying foreign governments, including Britain and the United States, have fanned anti-China sentiment.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that if anything bad happened in Hong Kong it would be bad for the U.S.-China trade talks.\n\nChina's Oct. 1 National Day holiday week is normally a time when Hong Kong is flooded with visitors, but many shops were closed and tourist numbers plummeted, said Lam, warning the city's third quarter economic data would \"surely be very bad\".\n\n\"For the first six days of October, during the so-called Golden Week holiday, visitors visiting Hong Kong plunged over 50%,\" she said. Retail, catering, tourism and hotels had been hit hard, with some 600,000 people affected, she said.\n\nThe territory is facing its first recession in a decade.\n\nHong Kong's metro, which carried some 5 million people daily, was only partially operating on Tuesday, scores of shops were closed and a tenth of ATMs were broken due to vandalism.\n\nLam appealed to property developers and landlords to offer relief to retailers whose businesses had been hit.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Farah Masters, Noah Sin, John Ruwitch, Clare Jim, Donny Kwok and Sharon Tam; Writing by Michael Perry; Editing by Paul Tait, Robert Birsel and Alex Richardson)", "description": "Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday the government had no plans at present to use colonial-era emergency powers to introduce more new laws, after a long weekend of violent protests saw widespread defiance of a ban on face masks.
