In \u201cStar Trek,\u201d a warp factor of 1 is light speed, and a warp factor of 9.9 is more than 2,000 times greater than light speed.\n\nBut James O\u2019Donoghue, a former NASA scientist who\u2019s now at JAXA, animated warp-speed velocities in the solar system using the Enterprise spaceship. He posted his video on Twitter on Monday.\n\nO\u2019Donoghue\u2019s animation shows it\u2019d take nearly 10 seconds to reach Pluto, and 18 hours to reach the nearest star, at close to maximum warp speed.\n\nThe planetary scientist said he feels \u201cdespair\u201d about the distances and speeds involved in space travel and, in part, made the animation \u201cto make everyone else feel as bad as me.\u201d\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nIn the sci-fi universe of \u201cStar Trek,\u201d spaceships with warp drives can zoom past the normally impenetrable limit of light speed, or about 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second) in a vacuum.\n\nThis trouncing of theoretical physics makes reaching alien-rich planets across the galaxy seem like just a convenient TV-commercial-break-length trip away.\n\nBut a new animation by the planetary and space scientist James O\u2019Donoghue, who used to work at NASA and is now employed by JAXA (Japan\u2019s national space agency), grounds the warp drives of those fictional spaceships in reality. He says the work gives him \u201ca sense of despair\u201d about traveling through space, even at superluminal speeds.\n\nO\u2019Donoghue previously animated the speed of light within the solar system, and the results were depressing. After receiving widespread attention for those animations, he began wondering what going faster might look like in reality.\n\nSo O\u2019Donoghue took the Federation starship USS Enterprise, commanded by Captain Jean-Luc Picard (played by Patrick Stewart) in \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation,\u201d and sent it flying from the sun to Pluto at varying warp-speed velocities.\n\nThe animated video above, which O\u2019Donoghue posted on Twitter on Monday, is almost as deflating as the scientist\u2019s first set of popular animations.\n\n\u201cI have genuinely felt a sense of despair at the distances involved in our solar system and beyond,\u201d O\u2019Donoghue told Business Insider, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s been one of my aims to make everyone else feel as bad as me.\u201d\n\nIncidentally, a follow-on series titled \u201cStar Trek: Picard\u201d is scheduled to premiere on CBS All Access on January 23 and on Amazon Prime the following day, according to CNN.\n\nWhat the new \u2018Star Trek\u2019 warp-speed animation shows \u2013 and why it\u2019s depressing\n\ncaption The Enterprise ship from \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation\u201d moving through space. source Paramount Pictures\n\nThere\u2019s no set-in-stone scale of \u201cwarp-factor\u201d speeds in the \u201cStar Trek\u201d universe. Over the more than 50 years of productions, different series and episodes and movies throw out conflicting numbers.\n\nHowever, Rick Sternbach and Michael Okuda \u2013 two technical advisers to \u201cThe Next Generation\u201d series \u2013 published a technical manual in 1991 that includes some solid figures, and it\u2019s those numbers (vis-a-vis a Wikipedia page) that O\u2019Donoghue said he leaned on for his animation.\n\nThat scale suggests a warp factor of 1 is light speed (shown below between Earth and the moon) and the typical upper limit warp of 9.99 is more than 2,140 times light speed.\n\nO\u2019Donoghue chose to depict the Enterprise flying away from the sun and across the solar system toward a finish line at Pluto. The spaceship starts out at warp 1 and eventually accelerates to warp 9.9, or about 2,083 times light speed.\n\nWarp 1 , or light speed, makes the Enterprise look like it\u2019s at a standstill over the sun. At this light-speed rate, the ship would take 5 hours and 28 minutes just to reach Pluto, which is about 3.67 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers) away from the sun. Meanwhile, Proxima Centauri \u2013 the nearest star to our own \u2013 is a dismal four years and three months away.\n\n, or light speed, makes the Enterprise look like it\u2019s at a standstill over the sun.

Warp 9.9 makes Pluto less that a 10-second trip away, and Proxima Centauri an 18-hour cruise.\n\nThis last rate of travel is thousands of times faster than the physics of our universe may ever permit.\n\nHowever, traveling at a warp factor of 9.9 from one end of the Milky Way galaxy \u2013 a body of hundreds of billions of stars that may stretch 150,000 to 200,000 light-years wide, according to a recent study \u2013 to the other could take 96 years. That\u2019s almost a decade longer than an average human life span today.\n\nEven considering the fastest \u201ctranswarp\u201d (or \u201cbeyond warp\u201d) speed achieved by the Enterprise, which is about 8,323 times light speed, according to \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation \u2013 Technical Manual,\u201d a transgalactic voyage would take 24 years. A transwarp voyage to Andromeda, which is the nearest galaxy to ours at about 2.5 million light-years away, would last about 300 years.\n\nA quarter of a century is a grueling amount of time that no holodeck, artificially intelligent companions, and extremely well-stocked spaceship bar may stack up against, let alone three centuries.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to feel sorry for them, however,\u201d O\u2019Donoghue said of the people in \u201cStar Trek,\u201d since \u201cwe ourselves haven\u2019t achieved even a 10th of 1% of the speed of light in our fastest-ever spacecraft.\u201d\n\nHumanity moves really, really slowly through space\n\nThe fastest any human-built object has ever gone relative to the sun is about 119 miles per second (192 kilometers per second), or 430,000 mph (692,000 kilometers per hour). NASA\u2019s Parker Solar Probe briefly achieves this speed when it careens around the sun, and flying to Pluto from the sun at that rate would take nearly a year.\n\ncaption An illustration of a Breakthrough Starshot \u201cnanocraft\u201d being propelled toward the Alpha Centauri star system with a powerful laser beam. source Breakthrough Foundation\n\nEngineers with the Breakthrough Starshot project are working toward achieving partial light-speed travel with tiny \u201cnanocraft.\u201d The idea is to rapidly accelerate them by shooting reflective light sails with powerful laser beams, ultimately flying them past nearby stars like Proxima Centauri (a red dwarf that just might host habitable planets).\n\nRead more: A startup is developing a 100-gigawatt laser to propel a probe to another star system. That may be powerful enough to \u2018ignite an entire city.\u2019\n\nYet even at a planned cruise velocity of 20% of light speed, it could take more than 21 years for the probes to fly past and photograph the nearby star system. On top of that, it\u2019d take another 4.24 years for their radio signals (traveling at light-speed) carrying image data to reach antennas on Earth.\n\nIf we really want to feel lonely, though, O\u2019Donoghue thinks we need look no farther than science fiction itself.\n\n\u201cI think it adds a layer of isolation and grittiness to know that even our nearest star takes dozens of hours at a rarely used warp 9.9 to get to,\u201d O\u2019Donoghue said. \u201cPerhaps this gives viewers a better sense of the magnitude of space and the frontier nature of the Federation ships and crew.\u201d\n\nCorrection: James O\u2019Donoghue recently left NASA to join JAXA, which is Japan\u2019s national space agency. We also misstated how long it\u2019d take radio signals from Proxima Centauri to reach Earth; it\u2019s about 4.24 years, not 21 years.", "description": "Business Insider - The animation shows how long it takes the starship Enterprise in \"Star Trek\" to reach Pluto at warp factors that break the known laws of physics..
