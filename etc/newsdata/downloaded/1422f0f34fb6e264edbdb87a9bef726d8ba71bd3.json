And if the forces did not know, once they realized that why did they not warn the protesters? The forces were focused on making sure no one helped the injured.'\n\nMourners pray over the flag-draped coffin of a protester killed during anti-government protesters during his funeral at the Imam Ali shrine in Najaf, Iraq.
