\u2013\n\n\u201cThe pressure of the street, and perhaps even more so the fear of economic collapse, will dictate an accelerated government formation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 49-year-old Hariri, who had already stepped down twice as prime minister in 10 years, could yet return as the head of the next government.\n\n\u201cHariri throws it all away to better negotiate his return,\u201d wrote the French-language newspaper L\u2019Orient-Le Jour.\n\nOne rising name in the Sunni community to which the position is usually reserved is outgoing interior minister Raya al-Hassan, who is the first woman to take that job and has received praise for her bloodless handling of the protests.\n\nLebanon\u2019s economy, crippled by ballooning public debt, has been sliding to the brink of collapse in recent months.\n\nHariri announced a much-delayed reform package last week in a bid to address some of the protesters\u2019 demands and the requirements for a huge foreign assistance programme to be unlocked.\n\nSome protesters want fresh elections to be organised, a move that would further delay the implementation of those reforms.", "description": "Beirut (AFP) \u2013 The resignation of Lebanon\u2019s government under pressure from the street looked set to ease a two-week-old nationwide lockdown", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/c2263b_lebanese-soldiers-get-traffic-flowing-removing-protesters-roadblocks-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
