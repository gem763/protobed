Researchers think the skill could be used by the insects to navigate gardens and landscapes for their favourite plants by counting landmarks.\n\nUnderstanding how bees process information could help scientists when building computer systems using basic numeracy.\n\nEarlier this month scientists revealed how honey bees are able to retain memories of good and bad social encounters, storing them in distinct clusters in their brains just like we do.\n\nResearchers analysed bee brains after exposing them to either positive or negative experiences \u2014 nursing a larvae or fighting off an intruder.\n\nThey found that these memories are stored in different areas of the so-called 'mushroom bodies', which are regions of neurons unique to the insect brain.", "description": "Researchers from Toulouse in France said that bees were able to count to low numbers and even understand the concept of zero, despite having tiny brains.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/08/19577044-0-image-a-5_1570780273735.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
