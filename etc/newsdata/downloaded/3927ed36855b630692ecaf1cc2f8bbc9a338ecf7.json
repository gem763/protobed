Revenue from the business, however, fell 14%, partly due to the sale of a business.\n\nInternational oilfield services revenue grew 6% from the prior quarter, helped by strong growth in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Europe, although it fell 3% in North America.\n\nNet income attributable to the company rose to $57 million in the three months ended Sept. 30 from $13 million a year earlier.\n\nAdjusted net income rose to $114 million, or 21 cents per share from $78 million, or 19 cents per share.\n\nRevenue rose 4% to $5.88 billion.
