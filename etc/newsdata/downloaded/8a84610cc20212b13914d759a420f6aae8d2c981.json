Previously he hailed the coach as a \u201cgenius\u201d \u2013 adding that there was \u201ctotal trust, total belief, total respect\u201d between Salazar and British Athletics.\n\nSebastian Coe admits he has not read report which led to Salazar\u2019s ban Read more\n\nSpeaking for the first time since Salazar was banned for four years for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d following a 140-page report from the American Arbitration Association, Black admitted he was \u201cshocked\u201d at the news \u2013 and appeared uncertain about his future.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be personally reviewing thoughts that I had, the decisions I\u2019ve made, the things that I\u2019ve said,\u201d Black said. \u201cHaving done that thoroughly, patiently, sensibly, I\u2019ll come to my own decision and that will run in parallel with discussions with UKA chair Chris Clark and the board. I\u2019m certainly not ready to make any decision.\u201d\n\nWhen Black was asked directly if he would resign, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019ve put in any time to at this stage. When you\u2019re the team leader you have a clear job and it doesn\u2019t matter what comes up you have to stay focused on that. I\u2019ve had brilliant support from British Athletics, the athletes and staff to enable me to focus on this competition.\u201d\n\nWhen it was put to Black that his response did not sound like an outright no, he replied: \u201cI\u2019m not able to answer with any more detail.\u201d\n\nIn the ruling, Salazar was found to have trafficked testosterone \u2013 a banned performance-enhancing substance, administered a prohibited IV infusion, and also tampered or attempted to tamper with Nike Oregon Project athletes\u2019 doping control process. He denies any wrongdoing and is appealing against his ban.\n\nMeanwhile Black insists he has total belief in Farah, who was not implicated in the Usada report and has always denied any wrongdoing. \u201cNothing at all has changed in terms of my belief regarding Mo Farah,\u201d said Black, who confirmed that he would be travelling to the Chicago marathon next weekend to act as Farah\u2019s physiotherapist. \u201cI think it is important to repeat that the British Athletics medical and support teams were always the people who were always on top of, and managing and directing the care of Mo Farah, so we have no concerns.\u201d\n\nThe US Anti-Doping chief executive, Travis Tygart, has also criticised Salazar for giving prescription medication purely for performance reasons \u2013 such as thyroid, painkillers and asthma treatments \u2013 which are not illegal under the rules of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Tygart also said that Salazar treated athletes like \u201claboratory animals\u201d with the treatments they were being given.\n\nLast week one leading British coach with an athlete at the world championships wrote to the UKA hierarchy calling for an investigation into whether such methods were ever employed by staff in charge of the British Athletics team.\n\nHowever, Black insisted that he was \u201cvery, very sure\u201d no British athletes had been \u201cinvolved in any of those processes\u201d. When asked specifically if any British athlete had used thyroid medication without medical need, he said: \u201cCertainly to the best of my knowledge, no British athlete has ever taken thyroid medication when it wasn\u2019t required. It was obviously confidential information but the only time any medication was used and so on was for a medical reason without any question.\u201d\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nBlack says he still wants to remain in charge of the British team at the Tokyo Olympics, although whether that will be up to him is an open question after Britain\u2019s lowest tally of medals at a world championships since 2005.\n\nHowever, Black believes there are still plenty of reasons to be optimistic after Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Dina Asher-Smith left Doha with gold medals \u2013 and he pointed out there were several near medal misses including Adam Gemili in the 200m and Callum Hawkins in the men\u2019s marathon.\n\n\u201cThere have been brilliant things, the biggest and strongest one was Kat,\u201d Black said. \u201cAfter what she has been through, the challenges she has had, the disappointment and the upset, she produced multiple personal bests and gold at world level. For me that was the most satisfying performance.\u201d\n\nBlack was also full of praise for Asher-Smith, who became the first British athlete to win three medals at a world championships. \u201cDina at an athletic level, she managed the circumstances and expectation and achieve the things we\u2019ve talked about and it\u2019s huge testament to her as a person and a personality.\u201d\n\nHe also praised Laura Muir for finishing fifth in 3:55 \u2013 her second fastest time \u2013 in the women\u2019s 1500m after such an interrupted preparation. \u201cI think she\u2019s probably learned something that says: \u2018Bloody hell, if I can [come in] off different or altered preparation, I\u2019ve got even more.\u2019\u201d", "description": "The UK Athletics performance director, Neil Black, is considering his position in the wake of Alberto Salazar\u2019s four-year ban for doping offences", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51a4b4c480b68e4c4a76b3a8b1dfd554bd8a703d/476_6_2404_1442/master/2404.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2a29d79f0c4397d08ec12edbe3b24da7", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
