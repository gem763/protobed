REUTERS/Rebecca Cook\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The strike at General Motors\u2019 U.S. plants should have very little staying power. That\u2019s not because members of the United Auto Workers don\u2019t have their hearts in it, or because the carmaker\u2019s executives have little at stake. It\u2019s simply because the two sides are far too close to a deal for it to be worth continuing for long.\n\nThe union hasn\u2019t called a strike at GM since 2007. And in the bad old days, such action could easily spiral out of control. A strike in Flint, Michigan, in 1998 lasted 54 days and cost GM more than $2 billion, for example.\n\nTimes have changed since then, though, and neither side is being unreasonable in their demands for the four-year contract currently under negotiation. The UAW wants to secure better wages and profit-sharing, restrict increases in healthcare costs, and find new uses for two factories GM intends to close.\n\nFor its part, the $52 billion carmaker doesn\u2019t want to increase its fixed costs, especially amidst rising concerns about a slowdown, and even a recession. But the company run by Mary Barra has already shown that it\u2019s willing to compromise. On Saturday, after the current UAW contract dating back to 2015 expired, GM offered to scrap most increases in healthcare charges, boost wages and bonuses, and even consider building new products in the two doomed plants.\n\nHad these proposals come earlier, UAW chief negotiator Terry Dittes told GM, it could have averted the industrial action that began just before midnight on Monday. That makes the decision to down tools look almost entirely symbolic \u2013 though it may also serve to draw some attention from a federal corruption probe into practices at the union.\n\nShareholders are sensibly pricing in at worst a fender-bender rather than a car crash. With GM\u2019s shares down about 5%, that\u2019s a modest hit of just over a week\u2019s worth of profit based on a $58 million-a-day run-rate for EBIT \u2013 the average forecast by analysts at Credit Suisse, Evercore ISI and Citigroup \u2013 and assuming a valuation multiple of 5.5 times projected earnings after stripping out interest and taxes.\n\nThe only reason the strike should last even that long is if any of the negotiators rediscover their predecessors\u2019 penchant for pigheadedness.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - The strike at General Motors\u2019 U.S. plants should have very little staying power.
