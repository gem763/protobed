(Jefferson Davis Parish/The Advocate via AP)\n\nAt least a half-dozen women told authorities that deputies raped and trafficked them to male inmates inside a long-troubled jail in southwestern Louisiana, according to newly unearthed state and FBI records.\n\nThe records offer a harrowing account of sexual assault being traded as currency in a contraband ring that pervaded the Jefferson Davis Parish jail. Three deputies were charged in the 2002 corruption case. One of them remains a small-town police officer in Louisiana, The Associated Press found.\n\nThe little-known case has drawn new attention and is highlighted in a Showtime docuseries examining the so-called Jeff Davis 8, a series of eight possibly related killings that remain unsolved despite the decade-long efforts of a local, state and federal task force.\n\nThe victims, ranging in age from 17 to 30, were killed between 2005 and 2009 in and around Jennings, Louisiana, a small town in Louisiana's Cajun country.\n\nThe records show the last Jeff Davis 8 victim, Necole Jean Guillory, had been a witness in the 2002 jail case. The five-part documentary, \"Murder in the Bayou,\" features footage of Guillory telling investigators about rampant misconduct inside the lockup.\n\nThe series finale, which airs Friday, reveals that Guillory told her mother shortly before her death that she believed local law enforcement had a hand in the slayings.\n\nThe Jefferson Davis Parish jail has seen more recent cases of misconduct, including this summer when two deputies were fired there for their role in a brutal beating that reportedly left an inmate with black eyes and second-degree burns.\n\nChief Deputy Chris Ivey said authorities recently transferred local inmates into a new facility that is more secure than the old parish jail, which was poorly lit and had spotty surveillance cameras. He told The AP none of the deputies accused of misconduct would be given badges by the current administration. \"They wouldn't be working for us,\" he said.\n\nThe newly released records, obtained by Showtime and reviewed by The AP, show \"a pattern and practice of sexual assault by guards at the Jefferson Davis Parish Jail stretching back nearly two decades,\" said Ethan Brown, an executive producer of the series.\n\nGuillory had been \"aware of significant law enforcement misconduct\" before she was found dead years later in a patch of grass along Interstate 10 in Acadia Parish, Brown said.\n\n\"She was the most insistent of the victims that the police were behind the killings,\" Brown told the AP.\n\nBrown, in his book about the Jeff Davis 8, wrote that Guillory knew most of the other slain women through their involvement in sex work and long feared for her safety.\n\nGuillory's death remains a mystery. But the records show that she and several other women made detailed allegations about sexual misconduct involving deputies and inmates at the parish jail. The FBI interviewed at least one woman who said she had been raped, the records show, but no federal charges were filed.\n\nFormer Jefferson Davis Parish Sheriff Ricky Edwards said at the time that two deputies had been arrested for taking bribes to arrange sex between inmates. He said one had sex with a female inmate, while a third deputy was fired for smuggling contraband into the jail.\n\nWhat the sheriff did not say was that at least a half-dozen women had accused deputies of running a jailhouse sex-trafficking ring in which female inmates were repeatedly coerced into having sex with male inmates and trustees.\n\nOne woman told authorities she was forced to have sex with a deputy, Eric M. Phillips, and that nothing came of her repeated complaints to jail staff, the records show. The Associated Press does not identify people who may have been sexually assaulted unless they have come forward and voluntarily identify themselves.\n\n\"I just want it stopped because it's not right,\" the woman told sheriff's investigators.\n\nDetectives took similar statements from several other women, including one who spent just a week in the jail. She told authorities she had been wrested from her bunk one night by an \"unidentified assailant\" who covered her mouth and, while removing her pants, told her to \"give it up,\" the records show.\n\nShe said she noticed Phillips, the jailer, watching the assault from the hallway.\n\nStill another woman said Phillips raped her after removing her from her cell under the pretense that she needed to see the jail nurse about her medicine.", "description": "At least a half-dozen women told authorities that deputies raped and trafficked them to male inmates inside a long-troubled jail in southwestern Louisiana, according to newly unearthed state and FBI records.
