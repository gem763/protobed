Soon, not only did the Astros star make his way to home plate \u2014 but so too did the three other Houston players on base. It was a grand slam at the worst possible moment for the Washington Nationals, and on this evening, the most predictable outcome.\n\nNothing went right for the Nationals in Saturday\u2019s 8-1 loss to the Astros in Game 4, who now have tied the World Series at two games apiece. Not for Patrick Corbin, the team\u2019s $140 million man who gave up four runs in six innings. Not for the offense, which for the second straight outing couldn\u2019t produce with runners in scoring position. And certainly not for the bullpen, which melted down in the seventh, assuring the Nationals would be traveling back to Houston.\n\nThis is not what fans had wanted to see in the first two World Series games in the District in 86 years. In back-to-back defeats, the Nationals hardly resembled the team that took a commanding 2-0 series lead over MLB\u2019s best regular-season team.\n\nOne major problem over these losses: The Nationals haven\u2019t gotten dominant performances from their starting pitchers, unlike for most of the postseason.\n\nIn 2019, Corbin found success because his slider was so effective. Before the game, ace Max Scherzer noted how the left-hander had firm control of the outside corners, which makes batters chase his slider and sinker.\n\nBut in Game 4, Corbin couldn\u2019t locate the zone early. After an eight-pitch at-bat to strike out George Springer, the 30-year-old then gave up a first-pitch single to Jos\u00e9 Altuve. It was the start of four straight hits, two of which scored Altuve and left fielder Michael Brantley. The Astros took a patient approach, allowing Corbin to work up his pitch count.\n\nThe Nationals, though, limited the damage. They got out of the inning when Anthony Rendon made an unassisted 5-3 double play. The National League MVP candidate had a stellar night defensively, making a number of diving stops.\n\nWhen it looked like Corbin recovered and found his rhythm, the Astros soon answered back \u2014 blasting a two-run homer deep into left in the fourth. Before Houston catcher Robinson Chirinos crossed home plate, he lifted his knee and slapped his chest to celebrate the 4-0 lead.\n\nThe Nationals, meanwhile, struggled to generate any sort of offense.\n\nSaturday was supposed to be a \u201cbullpen game\u201d for the Astros. Manager A.J. Hinch declined to start ace Gerrit Cole on short rest and instead planned on using a variety of relievers to manage his way through the contest. To do so, he tapped rookie Jos\u00e9 Urquidy, who had appeared in only 4 \u2153 innings in two appearances this postseason, to start.\n\nUrquidy, though, gave the Astros a much stronger performance than expected. The main reason? Strikes.\n\nThe 24-year-old got the Nationals to chase outside the zone. He relied primarily on a four-seam fastball, mixing in changeups, sliders and curveballs.\n\n\u201cWe need to be aggressive, but aggressive in the strike zone,\u201d manager Dave Martinez said earlier in the afternoon. \u201cWe chased a lot of balls outside the strike zone (in Game 3). And I don\u2019t mind our guys being aggressive, but I want them to be aggressive in the strike zone today.\u201d\n\nWhen the rookie exited after the fifth, he had allowed only two hits.\n\nFinally, in the sixth, the Nationals showed signs of life. They soon drew two walks off Josh James, the second of which prompted right fielder Adam Eaton to sprint to first instead of jog, perhaps eager for his team to start a comeback.\n\nThe Nationals, too, loaded the bases after Rendon singled to center, setting up a chance for Juan Soto or others to tie the game.\n\nOn the first pitch, Soto grounded out to first \u2014 though it scored Gerardo Parra. But the Nationals couldn\u2019t manage more than that. At the next at-bat, Howie Kendrick struck out, whiffing on a 90 mph two-seamer in the middle of the plate.\n\nThe inning ended and when the Nationals returned for the seventh, the game truly got out of hand. Martinez went to reliever Tanner Rainey \u2014 a move that immediately backfired. Rainey walked two straight batters and gave up a single, causing Martinez to turn to 42-year-old Fernando Rodney.\n\nThat, too, was a disaster.\n\nRodney hung a fastball down in the zone, and Bregman sent it into the stands. Until Saturday, Bregman was hitting just .208 in the postseason and an even worse .077 in the World Series, Bregman\u2019s struggles were so pronounced that after Houston\u2019s Game 3 win Friday, Brantley was asked what the team could do to help him.\n\nAfter facing Rodney, Bregman didn\u2019t need any help. Instead, he jogged the bases \u2014 stunning the Nationals Park crowd and making sure Houston will have at least one more home game this fall, Game 6 on Tuesday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
