FOREX-Cautious trade optimism boosts kiwi, Aussie; Fed awaited\n\n(Updates prices)\n\n* Optimism on trade as investors hope for Sino-U.S. progress\n\n* Dollar holds overnight gains on yen, Aussie supported\n\n* Fed cut expected, rhetoric to set tone\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n\n\nBy Tom Westbrook\n\nHONG KONG, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Hopes for an easing in\n\nSino-U.S. tensions buoyed trade-exposed Asian currencies on\n\nTuesday, while growing expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve\n\ncould take a wait-and-see approach to further easing underpinned\n\nthe dollar.\n\nMost moves were modest, though, as caution tempered the\n\nmood. The Australian and New Zealand dollars each rose nearly\n\n0.3%. The safe-haven currencies of the Japanese yen and Swiss\n\nfranc each eased very slightly.\n\n\"Global risks remain but have shown signs of subsiding,\"\n\nPhilip Wee, FX strategist at Singapore's DBS Bank said in a\n\nnote.\n\n\"China-U.S. trade tensions have stopped escalating ... the\n\nFed has reasons to sound less dovish on a 'half-full' narrative\n\nfor the U.S. economy.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump had said a trade agreement\n\nlooked to be ahead of schedule on Monday, without detailing the\n\ntiming. The United States also said it was studying whether to\n\nextend tariff suspensions due to expire in December.\n\nThat followed remarks late last week from both U.S. and\n\nChinese officials saying they were \"close to finalising\" a deal,\n\ndriving equities and bond yields higher on Monday. The appetite\n\nfor risk remained on Tuesday.\n\nThe Aussie AUD=D3 hit its highest since Wednesday,\n\ntouching $0.6859, while the greenback held on to its overnight\n\nprogress against the yen to stand at 108.97 yen per\n\ndollar, just below a three-month high.\n\nChina's central bank lifted its official yuan midpoint to\n\nthe highest level in over two months on Tuesday, and the\n\ncurrency edged higher to 7.0564 per dollar.\n\nThe dollar was a little softer against the euro at\n\n$1.1090 and a little stronger against of currencies at\n\n97.813.\n\nBeyond the trade headlines, the major focus this week is the\n\nFed meeting. The U.S. central bank is expected to cut rates for\n\na third time in a row when it concludes its two-day meeting on\n\nWednesday.\n\nInvestors are watching for any indication that further cuts\n\nare likely, with futures pricing suggesting more easing is\n\nexpected in 2020. If that is not foreshadowed, traders expect\n\nthe dollar to rise.\n\n\"The forward guidance will be the thing,\" said Westpac\n\nanalyst Imre Speizer in Auckland.\n\n\"It still looks like a done deal that they will cut, but\n\nthen the risk is that they might characterise that as just one\n\nmore insurance move ... the market will have to take out the\n\npricing it's got for future dates.\"\n\nThe British pound, meanwhile, nudged lower to\n\n$1.2855, with Brexit hanging in the balance.\n\nThe European Union has agreed to delay Britain's exit for up\n\nto three months, but the country is politically paralysed and\n\novernight parliament rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson's\n\nthird attempt to schedule a Dec. 12 election. Johnson has said he would try again, by a different\n\nlegislative route that would only require a simple majority,\n\nrather than a two-thirds majority.\n\n\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Cautious trade optimism boosts kiwi, Aussie; Fed awaited", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA5N005_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
