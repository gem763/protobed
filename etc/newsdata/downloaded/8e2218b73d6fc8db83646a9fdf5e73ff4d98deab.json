The next-closest team is the Marlins at $70.6 million. The Rays have always been one of MLB\u2019s thriftiest teams but the club has taken it to new levels as their Opening Day payroll of just over $60 million was their lowest since opening at $42 million in 2011.\n\nAlong with the Athletics, who happen to be their opponent in tonight\u2019s AL Wild Card game, the Rays have approached the game with a \u201cthem against us\u201d attitude where the big-spending Yankees and Red Sox must be dealt with by thinking outside the box. And, indeed, the Rays have, helping to popularize the use of \u201cthe opener,\u201d in which a reliever starts the game for an inning or two before handing the ball to the would-be starter or another reliever. Their front office has been analytics-savvy long before every team had an analytics department.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nOutfielder Kevin Kiermaier, who has been with the Rays being selected in the 31st round of the 2010 draft, was asked ahead of Wednesday\u2019s AL Wild Card game about the Rays\u2019 success despite having baseball\u2019s lowest payroll. Kiermaier said, via Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times, \u201cIt\u2019s always fun when you get to stick it to the man.\u201d\n\nThis is what the MLBPA is up against. Kiermaier thinks teams like the Red Sox ($236 million Opening Day payroll) are \u201cthe man\u201d when in reality \u201cthe man\u201d is Stuart Sternberg, the principal owner of the Rays. Sternberg, whose net worth is estimated at $800 million, bought the Rays for $200 million in 2004. The team is now worth $1 billion, according to Forbes. Payroll hasn\u2019t grown at all while Sternberg has quintupled his original investment. The Rays don\u2019t have to spend like the Red Sox but they also haven\u2019t had to roll with $19-76 million payrolls since their inception. That is their own choice.\n\nThe Rays have done well enough with their small payrolls, winning 90 games last year and 96 games this year, but imagine if they increased payroll to sign a big-name free agent in his prime in recent years. The Rays might not have spent the last five seasons \u2014 the prime of Kiermaier\u2019s career \u2014 watching the playoffs from home.", "description": "Rays outfielder Kevin Kiermaier seems to think \"the man\" is teams with higher payrolls than the Rays, which is every other team.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1ccfZrXrQQpm.gkAnFow0Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/a8CFedYmQ4BStHtkIKnK1w--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/99139c804f6d8fefed51d916c4b8a452"}
