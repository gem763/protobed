These computers contained test applications related to the DNC\u2019s analytics,\u201d which the hackers copied and stole.\n\nAnalytics are some of the most critical assets a campaign owns, often valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nWikiLeaks never released any of the data it stole in the final attack, and there is no discussion in either the indictment or the Mueller report of what the GRU did with the data.\n\nThe indictment and the report also indicate additional hacks and transfers of information that never became public, including the transfer of stolen materials to an undisclosed congressional candidate.\n\nOverview\n\nAccording to U.S. v. Viktor Netyksho, et al, on September 20, 2016, GRU hackers carried out an attack that resulted in them gaining access to \u201cDNC computers hosted on a third-party cloud-computing service. These computers contained test applications related to the DNC\u2019s analytics.\u201d However, neither the indictment nor the Mueller report appears to say what the Kremlin ultimately did with the data stolen in that attack.\n\nThis type of stolen data, as described in the indictment, appears to be information that would likely be more useful if kept private than if disseminated. Stolen analytical data could be useful not only as additional information on targets that Democrats hoped to reach, but also as a means of better anticipating, and therefore better countering their campaigns.\n\nThe Trump campaign has denied any coordination with the GRU hackers. However, on at least one occasion GRU hackers sent informal Trump advisor Roger Stone stolen information on the Democratic Party\u2019s turnout models and asked for his feedback, which Stone gave (Volume 1, p. 44).\n\nWhat makes the September attack particularly interesting is that it took place significantly after the email hack and release, which has a clear dissemination strategy. The GRU\u2019s Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear units hacked into the DNC\u2019s servers in the summer of 2015 and April 2016, respectively, and released the emails in July 2016. Meanwhile, the successful penetration of Podesta\u2019s inbox occurred on March 16, 2016. According to the Mueller report, metadata on files published by WikiLeaks suggest that the hackers transferred the data to WikiLeaks by September 19, 2016 (Volume 1, p. 47). In other words, by the time the GRU carried out the September hack, they were already effectively finished with the hacking operations that resulted in the release of emails during the campaign.\n\nThe report also suggests that there was additional information that the hackers obtained but did not release. For example, Russian hackers appear to have breached the Republican National Committee as well as the DNC prior to the 2016 election. However, while WikiLeaks released more than 20,000 emails and other documents from the DNC, and an additional 30,000 from Podesta\u2019s inbox, the hackers only released \u201capproximately 300 emails from a variety of GOP members, PACs, campaigns, state parties, and businesses,\u201d and did so not through WikiLeaks but through DC Leaks, a website the hackers themselves operated (Volume 1, p. 41-42). This suggests that the hackers either didn\u2019t steal as many emails from the RNC or, more likely given their and WikiLeaks\u2019s shared goal of preventing a Clinton presidency and electing Donald Trump, that they simply did not release all of what they obtained.\n\nAdditionally, the report says that, \u201con August 15, 2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona sent a candidate for the U.S. Congress documents related to the candidate\u2019s opponent\u201d (Volume 1, p. 43). It remains unknown who the congressional candidate was, and what, if any, of the stolen data ended up being used during the election.\n\nKey Questions for the Investigation", "description": "Russian military-intelligence hackers stole confidential political data from the Democratic National Committee that they did not release through WikiLeaks.
