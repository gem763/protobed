Ilhan Omar, for her refusal to support a bill that would impose economic sanctions on Turkey for its attacks on Kurdish forces.\n\nKanter, who grew up under the oppressive Turkish regime and has been the object of Turkish criticism since he came to the U.S. to join the NBA, slammed Omar\u2019s reticence to support the Protect Against Conflict by Turkey Act, according to the New York Post.\n\nThe Celtics star said that Omar\u2019s vote was \u201can absolute disappointment and shame,\u201d and even accused Omar of acting as an agent of Turkey.\n\nKanter said it seemed like Omar was on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s payroll and \u201cworking for his interests, but not for the American people and democracy!\u201d\n\nWhat an absolute disappointment and shame that the only democrat who did NOT support the Turkish bill aiming to stop the killing of innocent people is @IlhanMN who seems like on #DictatorErdogan \u2018s payroll working for his interests, but not for the American people and democracy! \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 30, 2019\n\nOmar was one of the few in the House who refused to support the bipartisan bill which was passed overwhelmingly in the House with a 403-16 vote on October 29.\n\nThe sanctions against Turkey for its attacks on the Kurds was not the only measure against Turkey that Omar refused to support this week. Omar also refused to support a measure that affirmed that Turkey committed genocide against its Armenian minority population in 1915.\n\nRep. Omar released a statement explaining why she did not vote in favor of the bill.\n\n\u201cA true acknowledgment of historical crimes against humanity must include \u2026 earlier mass slaughters like the transatlantic slave trade and Native American genocide, which took the lives of hundreds of millions of indigenous people in this country,\u201d Omar said.\n\nOmar was one of three lawmakers to vote \u201cpresent,\u201d along with Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) and Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX).\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Boston Celtics center Enes Kanter took aim at Democrat Minnesota Rep.
