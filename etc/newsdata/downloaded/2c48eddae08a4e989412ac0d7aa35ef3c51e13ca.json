Some recognised the actor, others just clapped and cheered anyway.\n\nBell, now 35, has spent the past 10 years as a secret weapon, briefly unleashed, in a series of big Hollywood comedies (and a couple of Paul Thomas Anderson pictures). She was a withering bridal shower guest in Bridesmaids, an unlikely pimp in Office Christmas Party and, most memorably, a stunningly insulting and deadpan foil to Jonah Hill in 22 Jump Street. That film was a showcase for Bell\u2019s particular gift: extra-dry delivery of wildly strange dialogue, much of it improvised.\n\n\u201cJillian makes me want to quit show business and realise I am a complete fraud,\u201d said Hill during the press tour, \u201cbecause she is the funniest person I have ever met in my life.\u201d\n\nJump Street took $330m (\u00a3256m); prospects are rather more modest for her first film as a lead, Brittany Runs a Marathon, about which critical buzz has gathered pace since its debut at Sundance earlier this year. Loosely based on a friend of the film\u2019s writer-director, Paul Downs Colaizzo, Brittany is a New Yorker in her late 20s, mired in toxic relationships and self-destruction. Attempting to score some prescription drugs from a doctor, she is informed that she is dangerously overweight and urgently needs to lose 40lb (18kg). Brittany pulls on her trainers, steps away from social media and changes her life. \u201cShe was flawed, and joyful,\u201d says Bell. \u201cIn pain and then hilarious the next moment.\u201d She is, she says, unlike anyone she has played before.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bell as Brittany.\n\nThe film carefully negotiates its way around fat-shaming territory, not subscribing to the idea that life becomes perfect once you achieve your target weight. \u201cBrittany realises it was never about losing weight, it was about growing up and taking ownership for yourself,\u201d says Bell, who lost about 18kg before and during the shoot; she wore padding for the marathon scenes (she didn\u2019t run the whole thing, in fact) because the film-makers were concerned she looked too slim. \u201cBut we were not going to shy away from how society treats you if you lose weight, and how that can sometimes seep into your own values.\u201d\n\nIn one scene \u2013 which Bell says is the hardest thing she has ever shot \u2013 Brittany is unspeakably cruel to a woman larger than herself. She spoke beforehand to the actor playing the woman, \u201cbecause I\u2019ve auditioned for \u2013 or played \u2013 a role like hers before and it doesn\u2019t feel fun.\u201d Does it seem important to play women who aren\u2019t always \u2013 dread word \u2013 likable?\n\nI know a lot of women who look like me. They have love in their lives and love for themselves. Where are those roles?\n\nShe smiles, likably. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to play women as real human beings. A lot of times the word \u2018likable\u2019 comes up, especially as a writer. They want to make sure that all the women are very likable and I think that\u2019s unfair because we\u2019ve had a lot of male characters who are incredibly unlikable that we root for. I\u2019m hoping women start to do that more: play characters who are flawed and make mistakes.\u201d\n\nSince the 28-day shoot, Bell has regained about half the weight she lost and feels, she says, \u201cmore like myself\u201d. She is overweight only by Hollywood standards. To anyone else, she looks, sitting in a black jumpsuit on a sofa, a plate of biscuits between us, completely normal \u2013 albeit wildly pretty.\n\nYet Bell has struggled with her body image. She wasn\u2019t sure if making the film would help, or exacerbate the problem. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can shake off the character. You have to figure out what your own story is. And [after making the film] I feel I\u2019m in a much better place. It\u2019s still rocky at times, but I try to be as kind to myself as I can.\u201d Brittany Runs a Marathon, she says, made her realise how much she beat herself up. \u201cWhat would it be like if I really enjoyed the things I was doing and focused less on how I looked? To look at all the seeds that have been planted in my brain from a very young age of what women should look like, and re-examine those thoughts and see if they\u2019re feeding me or not? And most of them were not feeding me.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bell as Brittany.\n\nStill, it must take some deep inner confidence to believe \u2013 be, as she says, \u201cweirdly of the opinion\u201d \u2013 that she wouldn\u2019t change herself to better fit into the film industry. \u201cNot like Hollywood would change for me, but I just thought if I get an opportunity to show what I can do, hopefully it will be enough. I know that it\u2019s probably a lot easier if you\u2019re going the route of comedy over drama.\u201d She has \u201cheard some horror stories\u201d, but never been advised to lose weight to get work, although she also says there have been numerous casting calls for roles for curvier women \u201cthat didn\u2019t feel they were worthy of love. I was like: \u2018I know a lot of women who look like me and they have love in their lives and love for themselves. Where are those roles?\u2019\u201d\n\nBell grew up in Las Vegas, where her father worked in advertising for many of the casinos. \u201cLittle things were odd,\u201d she says, \u201clike slot machines at the grocery store.\u201d She always wanted to perform, going to improvisation classes when she was eight and starting an improv group at high school; her dream, from childhood, was to be on Saturday Night Live.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bell in 22 Jump Street.\n\nAs a teenager, she began to have panic attacks, which continue to this day \u2013 she had one flying to London. She is eager to be open about anxiety: \u201cI would have liked to know when I was younger who was also going through this and that I wouldn\u2019t feel as alone.\u201d She once had an attack in the middle of filming, she says: \u201cI got through it, but it was really hard. I thought I was going to quit, but, thank goodness, I had another job I had already committed to. The people there were very warm, and I was very open about what happened.\u201d\n\nBell moved to LA when she was 18, and worked at a talent agency before landing small roles in the likes of Curb Your Enthusiasm (in the episode The Bare Midriff, as Larry David\u2019s distractingly unclad assistant), and as part of the Groundlings comedy theatre. At 25, she tried out for Saturday Night Live: she failed as a performer, but was signed on as a writer \u2013 although only for a year. \u201cI was disappointed not to have performed on it. But I\u2019m a really big believer in the whole \u2018everything happens for a reason\u2019 thing. A few years after that my dad passed away and I wouldn\u2019t have been around to spend time with him, I wouldn\u2019t have got the dog I have in my life now, [if I had been] stuck in New York for a long period of time.\u201d\n\nPlus, she then shot the telemarketers sitcom Workaholics, whose fans included Paul Thomas Anderson, who cast her in The Master (as a woman in Phillip Seymour Hoffman\u2019s group therapy scene) and in Inherent Vice (as a weird waitress to Benicio del Toro and Joaquin Phoenix).\n\nBell has written a film she hopes will start shooting next year, and runs a production company with her sister (with whom she lives). She is also in the next Bill & Ted instalment, and a gender-swapping remake of Splash, in which she will play opposite her Jump Street co-star Channing Tatum in the mermaid role.\n\nWhy does she think reboots of those old films are so popular? \u201cI think it\u2019s a simpler time. It feels very chaotic in the world right now, especially back in America and I think people miss the times of not having cellphones and just experiencing the world. A lot of the films in the 80s and 90s really explored relationships, and whimsical things, and things just felt lighter.\u201d People need to laugh, she says, \u201cmore than ever. And people need to feel hope. I think with our movie too, there\u2019s a lot of hope in there, and hopefully it\u2019s inspiring to people.\u201d The biscuits on the table remain untouched, and the next day I put on my running shoes.\n\n\u2022 Brittany Runs a Marathon is released in the UK on 1 November", "description": "The comic actor and former Saturday Night Live writer talks about her first film lead, in Brittany Runs a Marathon, and how the character\u2019s insecurities over body image fed into her own experience", "authors": ["Emine Saner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c7d308059778ae581e2a69f3e305672cc89ce81/0_137_5649_3389/master/5649.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c0562b0d76ad10cd39602fc0fc256482", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
