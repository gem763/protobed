Retire. Then travel. That's the natural order of things \u2014 or at least that was what I was raised to believe.\n\nThat all changed for me in 2016, when I took my first break from working full time to bike across the US for a month. My parents worried. They said I should wait, get a job first, then ask for time in between. But I wanted to move to Los Angeles, and I wasn't getting bites with a New York City address on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nBecause I entered the workforce at the start of the recession, walking away from the job I had at the time and the security it gave me was one of the biggest risks of my life. It also turned out to be one of the most rewarding. As terrified as I'd been at the thought of starting over and having to explain my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 gap to employers, I ended up securing a new job at a tech startup, one that came with a jump in title and pay \u2014 all while also getting a boost in quality of life, being able to trade New York City winters for year-round sunshine in LA (one of the top 10 places in the US for weather, according to US News & World Report).\n\nStill, the open road and the chance to spend more time with family and friends called to me. So when my husband and I made plans to have a baby at the beginning of 2017, we also began exploring the idea of taking time off to travel the world as a family of three. We wanted to see more of each other and less of the inside of an office, and neither of us wanted to miss our future little one's milestones.\n\nInspired by \"The Happiness Project,\" \"Nomadland,\" \"The Year of Less,\" and \"Flat Broke with Two Goats\" \u2014 all books that explore the theme of spending less and getting more out of life \u2014 and armed with data from the Budget Your Trip website and individual traveler blogs, we began saving in 2017.\n\nAt the end of the year, as a pre-New Year's resolution, we kicked things into high gear by starting our own \"year of no shopping\" that's still in effect. By the time we both stopped working full time in January 2019, we'd managed to achieve our ultimate savings goal: $36,000.\n\nHere are some of the strategies that helped us reach our target.\n\nSetting a monthly savings goal\n\nAs someone who has always freelanced in addition to working full time, I hoped to work while traveling to offset our costs. In the end, I was able to. (And as a result, we spent only $288.30 of our $36,000 savings on our seven-month world travels.)\n\nBut in the planning stages, we saved as if I wouldn't be able to.\n\nSince I was little, my parents always encouraged me and my sister to save half of our money from babysitting or doing chores, or from gifts from family. Throughout the years, that saving mentality has helped me cover the cost of my food, books, and other daily expenses during college and pay for my MBA without taking any loans. But even still, I'd never set or stuck to a budget or set a monthly savings goal before.\n\nBased on our research, I calculated that we needed to set aside $36,000 to pay for our adventures. To make that happen in two years, we planned \u2014 and managed \u2014 to save:\n\nTotal travel-fund goal: $36,000\n\n$36,000 Annual savings goal: $18,000 a year\n\n$18,000 a year Monthly savings goal as a couple: $1,500 a month\n\n$1,500 a month Monthly savings goal per person: $750 a month\n\nOver these two years, we were making a combined annual income of over $150,000, so we were setting aside roughly 10% of our pretax pay in our travel fund.\n\nCreating our own 'year of no shopping'\n\nAfter I read about Ann Patchett's \"no shopping\" challenge in The New York Times in December 2017, I instituted one of our own \u2014 right before giving birth and welcoming a new baby into our household. Not the most ideal timing.\n\nThat said, there are no hard and fast rules defining what \"no shopping\" means. We decided it would mean nothing new unless what we had was broken or worn out beyond repair, or we had a new need.\n\nFor baby and me, there were a lot of new needs. And later, when it came time to pack our suitcases to travel the world, a few more arose.\n\nHere were some of our big purchases, by category:\n\nMaternity and nursing clothing: $105, compared with the almost $500 the average expecting parent spends on new clothes per pregnancy, Fortune reported in 2015. Since I had already been biking to work, I had a mostly athletic wardrobe consisting of stretchy leggings and loose-fitting tops that didn't need many additions. Most of my spend went toward nursing bras, which I later passed on to other family members so they wouldn't have to incur the same expense.\n\n$105, compared with the almost $500 the average expecting parent spends on new clothes per pregnancy, Fortune reported in 2015.

Most of my spend went toward nursing bras, which I later passed on to other family members so they wouldn't have to incur the same expense. Travel clothes for two people: $240, compared with the $1,866 the average person spends on clothing annually, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This included $150 worth of UV/sports clothing, two pairs of water shoes for $60, and two pairs of walking shoes for $30.\n\n$240, compared with the $1,866 the average person spends on clothing annually, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This included $150 worth of UV/sports clothing, two pairs of water shoes for $60, and two pairs of walking shoes for $30. Sports gear for our traveling: $290.50, compared with the $487 the average American spends on sporting gear, a 2017 survey conducted by CreditCards.com found. Specifically, we purchased binoculars at $27.50, a refurbished sports watch (OK, this was a want) at $178, and a SteriPEN at $85.\n\nIn the end, we didn't exactly forgo shopping. But I did consider each purchase over time, adding them to wish lists on Amazon and boards on Pinterest \u2014 and reviewing, deliberating, and narrowing down before completing my online checkouts to get the best price. Still, compared with the annual averages, we saved $395 on nursing and maternity clothing, $3,492 on clothing for two adults, and $683.50 on sporting gear for two adults \u2014 or a total of $4,570.50.\n\nHaving only one car\n\nWhile living in LA for two years, I biked nine miles per day between work and home and sometimes extra to run errands or hang out with friends after work. Even when I was pregnant, I kept biking until I was seven months along, when I switched to taking the bus to keep costs low.\n\nI biked nine miles per day. Courtesy of Mary Kearl We spent $264.20 per month on transportation as a one-car household, including:\n\nGas: $81\n\n$81 Insurance: $153.20\n\n$153.20 Monthly payment: $0 (paid off)\n\n$0 (paid off) Parking spot: $0 (one free spot included with our rent)\n\n$0 (one free spot included with our rent) Ride-sharing-app rides and buses: $30\n\nBy not having a second car, we saved up to $839.20 a month, or $10,070.40 per year, by not incurring the cost of insurance, car payments, and an extra parking spot.\n\nKeeping food costs low\n\nAs with many tech companies, the startup where I was working at the time provided lunch \u2014 five days a week my first year, and four days a week the second year. There were often leftovers, which I was happy to bring home to avoid food waste and help keep our family's overall food bill low.\n\nAs a result, here's what we spent on food in a typical month:\n\nGroceries: $280\n\n$280 Restaurants: $350\n\n$350 Total: $630\n\nOur monthly spend was nearly $100 below what the average household spends on food in LA per month: $727. And these savings added up to $1,164 on a yearly basis.\n\nStill, we spent more when we ordered in or went out to eat than if we'd cooked for ourselves. For the one to two nights a week that we made these splurges, the costs added up \u2014 highlighting big room for improvement in our cost-cutting.\n\nSticking with a one-bedroom apartment after our baby was born\n\nWe were living in the fifth-most-expensive city for renters in the country, where the monthly rent for a median one-bedroom apartment is $2,250 and the median two-bedroom costs $3,030, the Los Angeles Daily News reported in July.\n\nBecause of our apartment's proximity to our jobs (both in LA's more expensive west side) and the major tourist draw (the beaches), our apartment was pricier than the city's median, at $2,700, but still lower than the 2017 median for a one-bedroom in our neighborhood ($3,320.26) and lower than the lowest price available for a two-bedroom in our building (starting at $3,373 a month).\n\nSo not switching to a two-bedroom helped us save $673 per month, or $8,076 per year, in rent.\n\nFreelancing on the side\n\nThroughout my career, I've always freelanced on the side. From 2017 to 2018, I was fortunate to have a few steady clients and earned about $30,000 in addition to my annual salary.\n\nI was fortunate to have a few steady clients and earned about $30,000 freelancing. Courtesy of Mary Kearl For one of my regular gigs, every Thursday night, after working an eight-hour day, I would log on for another several hours to tackle the team's weekly social-media calendar. This involved planning, writing, and scheduling tweets and Facebook posts for the week ahead.\n\nIt was a routine I was able to maintain throughout my pregnancy \u2014 including after an emergency surgery I had at 22 weeks \u2014 and my maternity leave. I scheduled the client's content right before going into labor, and by the time I came home from the hospital and was settled, it was time to get back at it again. (I wouldn't recommend everyone do this, but it worked for me.)\n\nNot paying for daycare or a babysitter for a year\n\nPlanning a year's worth of babycare without daycare or a babysitter required a lot of creative scheduling.\n\nTo make things work, my husband and I staggered our parental leave and paid time off to care for our baby across eight months. Throughout the rest of the year, my husband worked evenings, early mornings, weekends, and holidays, while I worked roughly 9 to 5, Monday through Friday.\n\nBetween my parents' and my sister-in-law's generous support, we were able to cover almost the remainder of our baby's first year. During the last month before we left for our world travels, my husband switched from full time to part time.\n\nAll in all, these scheduling logistics helped us save $16,542, the average (and staggering) cost of infant care in California, CNBC reported, citing data collected by Child Care Aware of America.\n\nHow did all the small efforts add up?\n\nOverall, these saving strategies may have helped us save as much as $40,332.90, while freelancing on the side brought in an extra income that allowed for more flexibility in saving:\n\n$16,542, by avoiding a year of childcare\n\n$10,070.40, by being a one-car household\n\n$8,076, by staying in a one-bedroom apartment\n\n$4,570.50, thanks to our year of \"no shopping\" (or spending less)\n\n$1,164, by keeping our food expenses low\n\nWhat saving $36,000 meant for our family\n\nHaving spent half a year traveling and experiencing the wonders of this world, we've now had nine months (and counting) together as a family without commutes and full-time work schedules competing for our time. That's a real privilege in this country, where paid vacation and holidays are in short supply and where employees who have vacation time feel pressured not to take it off. Where others \u2014 as my husband has experienced for most of his career \u2014 are unable to have the same two days off in a row from week to week. And where others yet, as has been the case for both my husband and me, feel the pressure to be on call and complete work outside of typical office hours.", "description": "To prepare for their trip, the couple cut costs in food, shopping, transportation, and housing, as well as instituted a \"year of no shopping.\"", "authors": ["Mary Kearl"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da4779ccc4a0a2a51324e14?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
