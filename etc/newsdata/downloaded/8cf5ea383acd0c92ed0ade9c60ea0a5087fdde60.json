REUTERS/Stringer\n\nBrent crude futures LCOc1 fell 52 cents to $62.58 a barrel by 0649 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 dropped to $56.89, down 40 cents.\n\nBoth benchmarks have fallen to their lowest level since before the attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities on Sept. 14.\n\n\u201cWhat really pulled the rug from underneath oil was Donald Trump\u2019s comments on trade last night ... He\u2019s still maintaining quite a belligerent position,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA.\n\nTrump criticized China\u2019s trade practices at the United National General Assembly on Tuesday and said he would not accept a \u201cbad deal\u201d in U.S.-China trade negotiations.\n\nChina is the world\u2019s largest oil importer and second-largest crude user. The United States is the largest consumer of oil.\n\nTrump also said he saw a path to peace with Iran even as he denounced Iran for \u201cbloodlust\u201d, cooling other risk premiums built into oil prices.\n\nOil rallied last week following a crippling attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil installations that has disrupted supplies from the world\u2019s top exporter. To meet its supply obligations to Saudi refineries overseas, Saudi Aramco is buying oil from other Middle East producers.\n\n\u201cRight now, the market is very concerned about the demand side of the equation, but I would caution against being complacent about what\u2019s happening in the Middle East,\u201d said Howie Lee, an OCBC economist.\n\nSaudi\u2019s crude oil stockpiles could run out within two months, and that could prompt buyers to look for supplies in the spot market and push prices higher again, Lee said.\n\nPrices were also weighed down by an unexpected build in U.S. crude inventories last week.\n\nU.S. crude inventories rose 1.4 million barrels last week, the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday, compared with analysts\u2019 forecasts of a 200,000-barrel drawdown.\n\nOfficial government data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration will be released later today.", "description": "Oil prices fell on Wednesday for a second day on worries that fuel demand could fall after U.S. President Donald Trump doused recent optimism over China-U.S. trade talks and reignited concerns about global economic growth.", "authors": ["Florence Tan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433570721&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O03V", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
