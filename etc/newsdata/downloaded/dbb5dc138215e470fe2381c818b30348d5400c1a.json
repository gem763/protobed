E REUTERS/Kieran Doherty\n\n\u201cYou hear the Tannoy now, right?\u201d the rugby World Cup winner asked during a break in the cacophony.\n\n\u201cThat Tannoy is relevant, because that volume was the level of fear and self-doubt I had in my head.\u201d\n\nGreenwood played a key role in England\u2019s last, and only, Rugby World Cup triumph in 2003 when they beat Australia in a dramatic extra-time final in Sydney.\n\nThis weekend Eddie Jones\u2019s England team will seek to replicate that feat when they face South Africa in Tokyo, and the 47-year-old reached back into his memory to tell Reuters what the current crop will be going through right now.\n\n\u201cI had this the whole time: \u2018Oh my god, oh my god, don\u2019t lose... Oh my god, oh my god don\u2019t make the error\u2019. (People think) \u2018No, no, you were all serene and calm... (but) that\u2019s like a front in press conferences,\u201d he said at an event hosted by Rugby World Cup partner Land Rover.\n\n\u2018WORLD CUP FINAL, BABY\u2019\n\n\u201cMy perspective was Monday, Tuesday, \u2018We\u2019re in a World Cup final, baby, this is why we play\u2019... Wednesday, Thursday, \u2018Oh my god, do not mess this up\u2019.\n\n\u201cLeft on my own, demons, thoughts, total and utter fear... just slept, just slept... The only way I could quieten the Tannoy is if I am sleeping or in the cinema, which I then end up sleeping in.\n\n\u201cFriday, pushing the food round the plate feeling physically sick, going \u2018I can\u2019t do this, I can\u2019t do this, I can\u2019t do this...\u2019 emotional energy spent...\n\n\u201cSaturday morning, \u2018Whoah, game day\u2019. Saturday afternoon I\u2019m back in it, I\u2019m alright. So, they\u2019ll all have their stories to tell. They\u2019ll all have their inner demons to struggle with... some may not, and they are the most blessed people or they have listened to the psychologists and haven\u2019t completely ignored them like I always did, which is possibly part of the problem,\u201d he smiled.\n\nUltimately, key for Greenwood was routine and familiarity, which, he said, helped slay the demons.\n\n\u201cYou know people go to work and they put a suit on and they\u2019re a lawyer, or they have an outfit and they\u2019re a plumber or they\u2019re a builder, or they\u2019re an engineer. They go to work; they\u2019re in work mode.\n\n\u201cFor me, sticking the England tracksuit on on a Saturday was work mode, and I could just release (the demons) and go through the processes.\u201d\n\nENGLAND BY 10 OR 12\n\nGreenwood said that before this World Cup he had cooled on the seemingly invincible All Blacks, saying he felt they had shown signs of weakness.\n\nEngland beat the three-times and defending champions in a breathtaking semi-final on Saturday.\n\nThe 2003 champion has instead been mentally backing England\u2019s opponents from 12 months back - until that sensational 19-7 England win over New Zealand.\n\n\u201cTo ignore last Saturday, and what England did, would be like blind faith in what I said 12 months ago,\u201d Greenwood said.\n\n\u201cJust because you voted Remain or Brexit (in Britain\u2019s EU referendum of 2016), actually you might then listen to the arguments, and the point of democracy is you can change your mind and then go \u2018actually I have now listened to all the arguments, and I think sport is like that.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just say because of what you saw 12 months ago... I go much more form horse, short-term, quality I\u2019ve seen, and I think England will win this by 10 or 12 points and will shut out the Springboks.\n\n\u201cThe defensive press will be too much, it will force South Africa to do something they don\u2019t want to do. You might go, \u2018Look at those blooming rose-tinted spectacles he\u2019s wearing\u2019, but I\u2019m going on what I saw, and have seen the past few weeks.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve got to stay true to what they did, which is keep the tempo high, keep the pace high, get those pullback balls going around the corner having All Black defenders guessing - I mean guessing - who\u2019s getting the ball, and if they do that then England will put themselves in very good shape to do something that hasn\u2019t been done for 15 years and 345 days.\u201d", "description": "A Japanese voice thunders out of a megaphone and political slogans drown out the voices on a Tokyo nightclub roof garden.
