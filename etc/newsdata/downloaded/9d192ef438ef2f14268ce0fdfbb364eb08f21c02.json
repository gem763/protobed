But is Trump truly the guilty party?\n\nIn my view, he\u2019s the wrong, or at least an incomplete, answer to this particular whodunit.\n\nHad the perpetrator been Individual 1 \u2014 and only Individual 1 \u2014 our dearly departed victim might still be alive, if perhaps wounded. The real answer is more of a Murder-on-the-Orient-Express-type conclusion: We all did it.\n\nUnindicted co-conspirators in this heartless murder include Republican lawmakers. They have been led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) and former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.), who tolerated massacres of civil rights, of rule of law and of other democratic values and institutions, so long as the party got its federal judges or tax cuts.\n\nThey got lots of help from their colleagues. Even when those colleagues were on record as disapproving of the exact kinds of anti-democratic actions Trump acknowledges taking.\n\nRecall that in June, Trump told ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos that he\u2019d gladly accept dirt from a foreign power on a political rival, and asserted that all politicians do so. Republican lawmakers flatly condemned Trump\u2019s approach to such foreign-offered \u201coppo research\u201d and said that they\u2019d go straight to the FBI if anyone ever made such an offer. Senators on the record expressing some version of this view include Majority Whip John Thune (S.D.), Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Thom Tillis (N.C.), Marco Rubio (Fla.), John Cornyn (Tex.) and Mitt Romney (Utah).\n\nFast-forward to today. Now that the hypothetical appears to have come true, they\u2019ve mostly fallen silent. Or worse: They\u2019ve urged the Justice Department to investigate the political rival whom Trump sought a foreign power\u2019s help in sullying, former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nAt best, you have Romney tweeting that \u201cIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme.\u201d Except that \u201cif\u201d is superfluous, given that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani acknowledged this way back in May.\n\nTrump\u2019s lickspittle Cabinet officials are also implicated in the Trump-coordinated assault on democracy.\n\nOn Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave multiple interviews in which he suggested that Biden is the real party responsible for interfering in U.S. elections. (Umm, what?) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u2014 who has elsewhere praised Trump\u2019s \u201cperfect genes\u201d \u2014 likewise dismissed as \u201cspeculation\u201d reporting that Trump directed Ukrainian leaders to investigate Biden. Even though Trump then appeared to confirm that \u201cspeculation\u201d (and then reversed himself again on Monday).\n\nEven former defense secretary Jim Mattis, out with a new book on leadership, ducked a question about whether it would be wrong for a president, any president, to ask foreign leaders to investigate political opponents.\n\nMeanwhile, the media has also dropped the ball.\n\nI don\u2019t just mean Trump\u2019s preferred propaganda outlet, Fox News. The rest of us have allowed the president to serve as our assignment editor. We spread his smears for him, and too often shy from coverage of any threat to democracy more technical than a tweet. At best, we ask Democrats what would, at last, count as an impeachable offense \u2014 but rarely direct such inquiries at Republicans, who, you know, actually stand in the way of a fair impeachment trial.\n\nDemocrats share some blame, too, feckless as they\u2019ve been. They dragged their feet in demanding critical documents, including Trump\u2019s tax returns. They failed to competently question petulant and obstructive witnesses such as former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. And they frequently seem more interested in attacking one another than holding Trump to account.\n\nGiven all this, can you really blame voters, disillusioned and disappointed as they are, for tuning out the onslaught on American democracy \u2014 and thereby contributing to its demise? Add them to the list anyway.\n\nYes, Trump has repeatedly, egregiously abused his power. He fired an arrow at the heart of our most cherished norms and institutions. But it took the rest of us to ensure that he hit his target.\n\nRead more:\n\nRandall D.
