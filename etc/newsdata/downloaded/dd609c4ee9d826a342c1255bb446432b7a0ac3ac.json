They welcomed the ruling but said efforts must continue to exhume people from mass graves where many still lie anonymously.\n\n\"It's a small victory but so much more needs to be done,\" said 55-year old Marisa Perez.\n\nFranco's family had appealed against exhuming his remains and against the government's plans to move them to the El Pardo cemetery. They had said that if his remains were to be moved, they should go to the Almudena Roman Catholic Cathedral adjacent to the Royal Palace in central Madrid, alongside his daughter.\n\nThe court rejected their demands.\n\n\"The fourth section of the third chamber has unanimously agreed to dismiss in its entirety the appeal filed by the family of Francisco Franco in relation to the exhumation of Francisco Franco agreed on by the government,\" the court statement said.\n\nA lawyer for the family of Franco said they would make further appeals, including to European courts, but a government source said the exhumation could now go ahead.\n\n\"This is a violation of personal and family rights ... with a government prohibiting a family from burying one of its members where it wants,\" lawyer Felipe Utrera Molina told TVE.\n\nA government report said last December that the Almudena cathedral was unsuitable as a burial place for security reasons.\n\nIn an effort to ease the transition to democracy after Franco's death, Spain passed an amnesty law pardoning political crimes committed during the conflict and the dictatorship in an accord known as the \"Pact of Forgetting\".\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [MADRID] Spain's supreme court gave the government the go-ahead on Tuesday to exhume the remains of dictator Francisco Franco and move them from the state mausoleum in which he was buried in 1975. .
