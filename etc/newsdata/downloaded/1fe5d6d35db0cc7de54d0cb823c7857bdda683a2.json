In their book Working Identity, they argue that while everyone needs to create and put forth an \u201cappropriate\u201d workplace identity, for members of minority groups\u2014women of all races, racial-minority men, LGBTQ people\u2014this becomes particularly taxing because their working identities must counter common cultural stereotypes. For example, black men may feel compelled to work longer hours as a way to repudiate stereotypes of a poor work ethic among blacks. To make matters more complicated, such strategies can backfire, reinforcing other stereotypes: Working those long hours may lead colleagues to assume that the workers lack the intellectual preparation needed for high-status professional jobs.\n\nCarbado and Gulati also note that minority professionals tread cautiously to avoid upsetting the majority group\u2019s sensibilities. Put simply, they can be visibly black, but don\u2019t want to be perceived as stereotypically black. As Carbado and Gulati write, a black female candidate for a law firm who chemically straightens her hair, is in a nuclear family structure, and resides in a predominantly white neighborhood signals a fealty to (often unspoken) racial norms. She does so in a way that an equally qualified black woman candidate who wears dreadlocks, has a history of pushing for racial change in the legal field, is a single mother, and lives in the inner city does not.\n\nThe same is true for professional workers who are members of other racial minority groups. For instance, Latina attorneys may be able to advance further at work if they take pains not to speak with any trace of an accent. These are challenges in addition to the more well-known ones\u2014the difficulties finding mentors of the same race, coping with racial stereotypes, being treated as a representative for one\u2019s entire racial group.\n\nSo what does this mean for black workers in professional environments? First, it\u2019s indicative of the degree to which race shapes occupational outcomes. In many circles, people feel more comfortable reducing racial issues to class-based ones, assuming that poverty explains much, if not all, of the differences between minorities and whites.\n\nBut for blacks in professional positions, issues of poverty are not the problem. Poverty does not explain biases in hiring, the need for particular types of emotional management, and the careful self-presentation that minority professionals engage in at work.\n\nSecond, all of this ought to encourage a rethinking of some of the existing efforts to create more diverse work environments. Do diversity and inclusion initiatives take into consideration how minorities placed in those environments feel? How can policies create not just more equitable hiring processes, but address the emotional toll of being a racial minority in a professional work setting?\n\nIn the current political climate, there is generally support for solving race-related employment challenges by focusing on job training and education\u2014in other words, increasing human capital to improve access. Given the research, it\u2019s also important to consider how to create better workplaces for the minority professionals who are already in these jobs.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
