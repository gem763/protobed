McGahn II, but a ruling could take months, perhaps after the window closes to make an impeachment case before next year\u2019s elections overtake Washington.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Democrats focused on trying to draw out details about how Mr. Trump asked Mr. Lewandowski to pressure the attorney general at the time, Jeff Sessions, to diminish the scope of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nDemocrats view the episode as an attempt to gut the inquiry, and Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators suggested that it provided sufficiently plausible evidence of criminal obstruction of justice to present to a grand jury.\n\nAs Mr. Mueller recounted, Mr. Trump met with Mr. Lewandowski in the Oval Office in mid-2017 and criticized Mr. Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing the Russia investigation.\n\nThe president asked Mr. Lewandowski, a private citizen who has never served in the administration, to deliver a message that Mr. Trump dictated on the spot. Mr. Sessions should give a speech announcing that Mr. Trump had been treated unfairly and that he would limit the scope of the special counsel investigation, the president said.\n\nMr. Lewandowski made some effort to follow through, setting up a meeting with Mr. Sessions and trying to enlist Mr. Dearborn, a former Sessions aide, in the task, but ultimately Mr. Lewandowski never conveyed the directive.\n\nDemocrats pounced on the strange situation as evidence that the president was illegally trying to interfere with the inquiry and hide his efforts to do so.", "description": "The former Trump campaign manager confirmed that the president had once asked him to help gut the Mueller investigation.", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/17/us/politics/17dc-lewandowski1/17dc-lewandowski1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
