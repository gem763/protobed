REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/Files\n\nTCS kicks off India\u2019s corporate earnings season, and in the quarter ended September company profits were expected to be muted, given a slowdown in the domestic economy.\n\nRatings agency Crisil warned in a note on Thursday that India Inc\u2019s revenue likely fell to a 14-quarter low in the three months ended September due to a sharp fall in demand across consumption segments.\n\nTCS has historically managed to outperform peers despite a lagging global economy, but had said last quarter that it only expected to \u201csustain double-digit growth\u201d this fiscal year.\n\n\u201cAs of now, the second half of the year looks challenging,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Gopinathan said at a post-earnings press conference on Thursday.\n\nCompanies like TCS, which earn most of their revenue from servicing European and American companies, have been weighed down by an escalating trade war between the United States and China and Britain\u2019s likely chaotic exit from the European Union.\n\n\u201cOur strategy is to stay focused on the opportunity and not look at macro so much,\u201d Gopinathan said.\n\nAccording to Centrum Broking Pvt Ltd analyst Madhu Babu, TCS will now have 8.2% constant currency dollar growth in the full year which will be way below its double-digit growth guidance.\n\nIn the second quarter, the company\u2019s profit rose 1.8% to 80.42 billion rupees ($1.13 billion), missing the average analyst estimate of 82.55 billion rupees, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nOperating margins dropped to 24% from 26.5%, hurt by investments in the company\u2019s digital business and expenses related to hiring.\n\nTCS reported a net addition of 14,097 employees in the three months ended Sept. 30, the most ever in a single quarter.\n\nTCS, a part of salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group, said it saw softness among large banks across the United States, the U.K. and Europe.\n\nThe company - whose clients include the Netherlands-based ABN Amro Bank (ABNd.AS), Citigroup UK and Norway\u2019s DNB (DNB.OL) - said revenue in its key banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) segment rose only 5.3% to 154.27 billion rupees.\n\nTotal revenue increased 5.8% to 389.77 billion rupees.\n\nBFSI, the company\u2019s biggest earner, contributed to over a third of its revenue in the last financial year.\n\nRival Infosys Ltd (INFY.NS) reports its quarterly numbers on Friday.\n\n($1 = 71.0850 Indian rupees)", "description": "Tata Consultancy Services Ltd warned of a challenging second half after India's No. 1 IT services exporter missed September-quarter profit on Thursday, as a slowing global economy forced many of its clients to cut back spending.", "authors": ["Derek Francis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439234119&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990WQ", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
