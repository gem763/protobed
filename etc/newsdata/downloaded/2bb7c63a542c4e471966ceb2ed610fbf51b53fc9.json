The team didn\u2019t provide an exact timetable for his return, but he is expected to be out for at least one month.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not good for us. That\u2019s a big injury,\u201d McVay said. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough guy, man, but it was a physical game. It was something that you just hate for him because of how productive he\u2019s been for us and what he\u2019s meant to our team and all the things that he\u2019s done. That\u2019s going to be a big loss. Guys are going to have to step up in his absence.\u201d\n\nMatthews finished with five total tackles and a sack against the Seahawks. He also drew a roughing the passer penalty in the fourth quarter for a hit on Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson.\n\nRams outside linebacker Samson Ebukam replaced Matthews and is expected to fill in as a starter in his absence.
