(Image: Audrey Mok, Archie Comics)\n\nArchie Horror\u2019s literal re-vamp of Riverdale\u2019s highest-class high schooler Veronica Lodge has already given us plenty to sink our teeth into \u2014 whether it\u2019s in her debut miniseries or her ongoing crossover with Jughead: The Hunger. But it\u2019s once again time for Ronnie to spread her bat wings and fly solo, and we have the first details on her brand new comic.\n\nSet after the events of Jughead: The Hunger vs. Vampironica \u2014 which has had dire ramifications for not just the titular supernatural heroes, but, incredibly, the entire Archie Comics lineup/multiverse as we know it!? \u2014 Vampironica: New Blood sees Ronnie return to her own universe, forever changed by the events of her time with werewolf Jughead.\n\nPenned by Frank Tieri and Michael Moreci, the five-issue series will see Audrey Mok\u2019s debut on interior art for an Archie Horror series, alongside Matt Herms and Jack Morelli on colours and lettering, respectively.\n\n\u201cI feel lucky and honoured to be working with Archie Comics again! Working on a horror title is unlike my previous work for Archie,\u201d Mok said in a statement provided to Kotaku. \u201cIt is an opportunity to bring in [a] different tone and approach on the art for this series. I am also very excited to be working with Frank and Michael, with their incredible writing, I cannot wait to know where they take us as we follow Vampironica\u2019s journey in discovering more about herself and exploring the vampire world.\u201d\n\nMok will also be providing main covers for the miniseries. (Image: Audrey Mok, Archie Comics)\n\n\u201cWhat can I say? I had so much fun writing Vampironica in Jughead: The Hunger vs. Vampironica that I just had to keep doing it \u2014 and thankfully Archie tolerates me enough to let me keep doing it,\u201d Frank Tieri joked in a statement to Kotaku. \u201cAnd yes, for fans of JvsV, we\u2019ll def be spinning things out of this series from the reveals made in that crossover. You can always say that JvsV was a prelude of what was to come!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not same old same old however \u2014 at least, as far as \u201csame old same old\u201d can be for a vampire. New Blood will build directly off a gamechanging reveal on a more personal level for Veronica that fans will uncover in Jughead: The Hunger vs. Vampironica #5, that sees her question everything she\u2019s known about her and her family\u2019s vampiric legacy.\n\n\u201cIn JvsV #5 \u2014 out in a couple of weeks, kids! Buy multiple copies! \u2014 we\u2019ll see a MAJOR game changing reveal as far as Vampironica goes,\u201d Tieri teased.\n\n\u201cIt really changes everything as far as what she knows about her and her family. How does she deal with this shocking revelation now that she\u2019s back in her own reality? And what other Lodge family secrets has she been kept from? It all comes to a head in our first arc as what she uncovers may actually lead to nothing short of an all out full-fledged vampire war. So yeah, I guess everyone can see we have some big plans for this book... plans that\u2019ll change Vampironica\u2019s world forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur approach to continuing Veronica\u2019s vampire tale is to really ground both her character and the story itself,\u201d Michael Moreci, Tieri\u2019s co-writer on the series, added. \u201cEssentially, this is a coming-of-age story we\u2019re telling, with some cool twists and turns and a whole bunch of bloody horror for readers to \u2014 pun fully intended \u2014 sink their teeth into.\u201d\n\nImage: Laura Braga, Archie Comics Check out this gallery of variant covers for Vampironica: New Blood #1.

He\u2019s much more organised than I am, which certainly helps!\n\nWe\u2019re all marvelling at the pages Audrey keeps handing in \u2014 whether it was scenes where Vampironica explores her history or it\u2019s just plain good ol\u2019 vampires beating the hell out of other vampires, she\u2019s certainly brought her \u2018A\u2019 game. The whole team really has and I hope fans can see that and have as much fun with the book as we\u2019re having putting it together.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorking on an Archie horror title is a tremendous privilege,\u201d Moreci concluded. \u201cSabrina, The Hunger, and Afterlife are all terrific comics, and we\u2019re out to craft something just as special. Luckily, we\u2019ve got a great team \u2014 writing with Frank has been fantastic, and we\u2019re both really excited about our work here. And you can\u2019t ask for better than Audrey, who\u2019s as talented as they come.\u201d\n\nAs Tieri concluded himself, with his own vampire punnery: \u201cIt\u2019s really going to be a fangtastic time.\u201d\n\nIndeed. The stakes are raised for Veronica when Vampironica: New Blood #1 hits shelves on December 4.", "description": "Archie Horror\u2019s literal re-vamp of Riverdale\u2019s highest-class high schooler Veronica Lodge has already given us plenty to sink our teeth into \u2014 whether it\u2019s in her debut miniseries or her ongoing crossover with Jughead: The Hunger.
