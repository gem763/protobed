Yes, it\u2019s a hugely effective plot device when you need to ramp up the drama. But it\u2019s inconvenient when you kill off your main character and thereby boost demand among audiences to see them reappear.\n\nThe prequel, cloning, time travel, magic and alternative universes have all been used in science fiction and fantasy to bring back beloved mainstays of 20th and 21st-century Hollywood, with different degrees of success. Most fans of Sigourney Weaver\u2019s Ellen Ripley would wish she had never returned as a freaky xenomorph-infused clone of herself in Jean-Pierre Jeunet\u2019s tacky and implausible Alien Resurrection, but few Lord of the Rings heads took issue with Ian McKellen\u2019s Gandalf returning with shiny ironed tresses a few shades paler after his battle with the Balrog in The Return of the King.\n\nIs bringing back dead characters artistically acceptable in the Marvel universe? The jury is still out. The resurrection of scores of superheroes in Avengers: Endgame, after that film\u2019s reversal of Thanos\u2019s nefarious fingersnap in the preceding Avengers: Infinity War, was carried out smoothly. What we hadn\u2019t necessarily expected was the news that two of the biggest casualties of Endgame \u2013 the characters who didn\u2019t get to come back this time \u2013 will actually be sort of coming back after all in Cate Shortland\u2019s forthcoming Black Widow movie.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Continuity question \u2026 Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow in Avengers: Endgame. Photograph: Everett/Alamy\n\nScarlett Johansson needs to be in the long overdue film if the Marvel Comic Universe is to preserve continuity. And given the movie is set after the events of Captain America: Civil War, it\u2019s plausible for Robert Downey Jr\u2019s Tony Stark/Iron Man to be back, too.\n\nYet this rather feels like cheating. Marvel wants the tears streaming down your face as the always flawed and not always 100% heroic Stark finds redemption by making the ultimate sacrifice in Endgame, just as he\u2019s finally found a soupcon of peace, settled down with his family and stopped chasing much younger women. But the studio would also like the opportunity to roll out its big metal gun for one last adventure.\n\nThis feels a lot like Disney\u2019s decision to restore Mark Hamill\u2019s Luke Skywalker to the screen in the forthcoming The Rise of Skywalker, in which the equally flawed cosmic paladin also redeemed himself by figuratively falling on his own laser sword for the greater good, only to be given another outing. That Skywalker will presumably be some kind of souped-up Force ghost in JJ Abrams\u2019s return to the saga doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that Hollywood is trying to have its space cake and eat it again.\n\nPerhaps Hollywood has been eating too much space cake, and is thus toying with our wounded emotions so in the name of making a fast buck. Downey Jr\u2019s classy and multilayered performances as Iron Man over the best part of a dozen movies were always the garlic and chilli sauce on the MCU\u2019s delicious shawarma. Returning him to the scene only just over a year since he died (in real time), no matter how plausibly, is like digging a yummy morsel out of the compost bin and eating it next day for breakfast.\n\nAnd who\u2019s to say Downey Jr won\u2019t be wheeled out for more episodes should Black Widow prove a huge smash? It can\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t happen. Nobody likes to see something they\u2019ve already consumed suddenly repeating on them.", "description": "Ellen Ripley and Gandalf have staged comebacks, but making Marvel fans watch their heroes die, then blithely return, is a big ask emotionally", "authors": ["Ben Child"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/118d981dab437449e4d8da1b1db29beaee6121be/687_324_2124_1275/master/2124.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c5b414be094753a8b445c5ff1cf740cf", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
