(AP) - Corey Kluber is injured, Carlos Carrasco continues to work his way back from leukemia treatment and Trevor Bauer was traded, and still the Cleveland Indians continue to get solid pitching.\n\nRookie Zach Plesac threw a four-hitter for his first complete game in the majors as the Indians kept pace in the AL playoff race, blanking the Los Angeles Angels 8-0 Tuesday night.\n\nThe right-hander is the fifth Cleveland pitcher to toss a shutout this season, which leads the majors. He struck out five and walked two while throwing 114 pitches.\n\nPlesac became the first Indians rookie to throw a shutout since Jeremy Sowers did it twice in 2006.\n\n\u201cAfter the first inning I was able to settle in,\u201d said Plesac, who had allowed 10 earned runs in last two starts. \u201cWe had a good game plan and rhythm going.\u201d\n\nFrancisco Lindor and Jordan Luplow homered as the Indians stayed a half-game behind Oakland for the second AL wild-card spot. Cleveland trails wild-card leader Tampa Bay by two games.\n\n\u201cI think every win is important right now no matter if the other team wins or loses. If we have a good month, we will be in the playoffs,\u201d Lindor said. \u201cWe\u2019re on a mission. It\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d\n\nThe Indians, who have won four of five, also got four RBIs from Franmil Reyes. The Angels, again playing without superstar outfielder Mike Trout, have dropped three in a row - the loss ensured they will miss the postseason for the fifth straight year.\n\nPlesac\u2019s previous high in innings was seven on five occasions. It was the sixth time in 19 starts he has thrown over 100 pitches. The most pitches he threw was 20 in the first before he had five innings where he threw 11 or fewer.\n\n\u201cHe got behind a couple hitters in the first but the rest of the game he worked ahead and got early outs,\u201d Cleveland manager Terry Francona said.\n\nFrancona thought about taking Plesac out after eight innings, but Plesac told him and pitching coach Carl Willis that he felt good and wanted to go out for the ninth.\n\nLindor hit his 30th homer, a solo drive off Trevor Cahill in the seventh. Luplow hit a two-run homer off Jos\u00e9 Suarez (2-6) in the second. He drew a bases-loaded walk in the third before Reyes hit a three-run double.\n\nSuarez gave up six runs on four hits in three innings. The left-hander has lost five of his last six starts.\n\nRARE AIR\n\nLindor joined Alex Rodriguez as the only shortstops in major league history to have three or more seasons of at least 30 home runs before turning 26.\n\nHis accomplishment might be more noteworthy considering he was injured the first four weeks of the season. A strained calf caused Lindor to miss spring training and then he sprained his ankle during a rehab assignment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful that I am healthy and I\u2019m not taking anything for granted,\u201d Lindor said.\n\nHIT (BY PITCH) PARADE\n\nCleveland batters were hit by pitch four times, which is only the 14th time that has happened since 1908.\n\nIndians slugger Yasiel Puig was hit by a pitch from Suarez his first two times up. Puig exchanged words with Suarez while walking up the first base line after he was hit in the foot during the third inning and was restrained by Francona.\n\nIt is the first time in Puig\u2019s seven-year career that he had been by a pitch twice in a game.\n\n\u201cI thought he handled himself great. I probably got a little more over-excited than he did,\u201d Francona said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone was throwing at anyone.\u201d\n\nCarlos Santana was also hit by a Suarez pitch while Luplow was tagged by a pitch from Cahill. It was the ninth time in Angels history they have hit four batters.\n\n\u201cClearly, command was an issue tonight. He was trying to do what he did in Oakland by pitching in, but obviously a few went too far in,\u201d Angels manager Brad Ausmus said of Suarez.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nIndians: OF Tyler Naquin has been tentatively scheduled to have surgery on his right knee Thursday after receiving a second opinion in Houston. Naquin tore the ACL in the knee after running into the outfield wall during a game at Tampa Bay on Aug. 30. There still remains some swelling in the knee that could delay the surgery.\n\nAngels: Trout sat out a third straight game after he had a cryoablation procedure to deaden the tissue around the irritated nerve in his right foot.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIndians: RHP Adam Plutko (6-4, 4.44 ERA) allowed one run on five hits with four strikeouts in 5 1/3 innings to beat the Angels on Aug. 3.\n\nAngels: LHP Dillon Peters (3-2, 4.45 ERA) pitched a career-best 7 2/3 innings vs. the Indians on Aug. 2 but did not factor in the decision.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Corey Kluber is injured, Carlos Carrasco continues to work his way back from leukemia treatment and Trevor Bauer was traded, and still the Cleveland Indians continue to get solid pitching.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Reedy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/indians_angels_baseball_71866_c0-145-3468-2167_s1770x1032.jpg?6cfea098091c3ec0e05521b200c8fda23d0e89e5", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
