Both matches were among the most in-demand when tickets went on sale.\n\nThe Scots are scheduled to play the hosts at the 72,000-seater Yokohama stadium on Sunday, a day after England meet France at the same venue on the Pacific coast south of the Japanese capital. But the stakes are highest for the Scots, who would be eliminated if their match against Japan were to be cancelled, assuming that Ireland beat Samoa in Fukuoka on Saturday.\n\nThe potential for a tournament that has won praise for its near-seamless organisation to be disrupted by the weather has turned Scotland\u2019s head coach, Gregor Townsend, into an amateur meteorologist.\n\nAsked if he had any weather updates, Townsend told reporters: \u201cI checked the weather app this morning, about eight hours ago, and it did look like it was heading into Tokyo this weekend, unless it has changed since then. \u201cIt is a few days away and it could miss the Tokyo area, or it could still go there and obviously we\u2019ll be getting updates from World Rugby in the next two days as to what the contingencies are.\u201d\n\nTownsend added: \u201cWe\u2019ve had contact to say there will be an update over the next 24 to 48 hours, so I\u2019m sure that alternative venues and arrangements are being looked at not just for our game but the other games that could be affected by it, England and France play in the same stadium the night before. I know it was getting looked at for the Ireland game as well when the forecast was that it was going to Fukuoka.\u201d\n\nWorld Rugby\u2019s official position is that any games cancelled due to bad weather are registered as scoreless draws, with both sides awarded two points. But rumours that the matches will go ahead at alternative venues locations were swirling as violently as the typhoon winds approaching the Japanese mainland on Wednesday evening.\n\nSources suggested the England versus France match could be moved to Oita, in Japan\u2019s far south, while Japan could play Scotland in Sapporo the country\u2019s far north. Others have suggested that the hosts\u2019 meeting with Scotland could be delayed to avoid saddling the latter with an elimination many would consider a travesty. The French rugby newspaper, Midi Olympique, claimed that both matches would be cancelled.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Super Typhoon Hagibis over the Northern Mariana Islands.

But assistant coach John Mitchell said Eddie Jones\u2019s players were preparing for all contingencies.\n\n\u201cOne thing we really pride ourselves in all our preparation is to be adaptable and flexible for anything that may throw us off,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cAt the end of the day we are looking forward to playing France wherever that may be. It is where our preparation is totally focussed and at the end of the day we don\u2019t let that noise enter our preparation. It is not something we decide, that is World Rugby\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nAsked about the ramifications of not playing the French as scheduled on Saturday, Mitchell added: \u201cWe are really looking forward to playing France. If there are other factors outside our control we will find ways of preparing. Ultimately, though, we\u2019re looking forward to playing France and that\u2019s where our focus is.\u201d\n\nFor now, all eyes are on Typhoon Hagibis, and the forecast does not look encouraging for Townsend\u2019s men. Japan\u2019s meteorological agency warned on Wednesday that the typhoon could make landfall on Japan\u2019s main island Honshu over the weekend, bringing strong winds, heavy rain and high waves across a wide area.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nThe super storm, currently bearing down on the Ogasawara islands in the Pacific with winds of up to 270 kph, is forecast to strike western and eastern areas of the country between Saturday and Sunday.\n\nHagibis is expected to be as powerful as four of the biggest typhoons to hit Japan in recent decades, including Typhoon Faxai, which caused widespread power cuts in the greater Tokyo area last month.\n\nFaxai, which also delayed the England squad\u2019s arrival in Japan, killed three people and injured more than 100 others and left almost a million homes without electricity.\n\nAdditional reporting by Andy Bull in Shizuoka, Gerard Meagher in Kumamoto, and Robert Kitson in Tokyo", "description": "England\u2019s clash with France may be moved to Oita or cancelled; Japan v Scotland could be postponed 24 hours", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6abba15e8895648712703887a615082e91ae9793/0_0_3695_2217/master/3695.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=78fb5fe0fa92d2f323da82040c4b4c69", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
