Last winter and spring, she transferred $10.4 million in leftover funds from her 2018 Senate campaign to underwrite her 2020 run, a portion of which was raised from the same donor class she is now running against\u2026\n\n\u201cCan you spell hypocrite?\u201d said former Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, who contributed $4,000 to Ms. Warren in 2018 and is now supporting former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nMr. Rendell said he had recruited donors to attend an intimate fund-raising dinner for Ms. Warren last year at Barclay Prime, a Philadelphia steakhouse where the famed cheesesteak goes for $120. (The dish includes Wagyu rib-eye, foie gras, truffled cheese whiz and a half-bottle of champagne.) He said he received a \u201cglowing thank-you letter\u201d from Ms. Warren afterward\u2026\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t have any trouble taking our money the year before,\u201d Mr. Rendell said. \u201cAll of a sudden, we were bad guys and power brokers and influence-peddlers.
