But I think we still need to ascertain the facts from the very thorough investigation,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cI'm very glad that the speaker of the House has ordained that the investigation go forward and then decide, I guess with the whole House voting on it, whether or not to proceed with the actual impeachment of the president.\u201d\n\nHe reserved judgment on whether he thought Trump deserved to be removed from office, telling Mitchell \u201cI think it still remains to be seen\u201d whether removing Trump from office would be a good thing or a bad thing, adding that it depended on what Democrats\u2019 investigation reveals. Carter was clear-sighted about the slim odds that the Senate would vote to convict the president on any articles of impeachment that came out of the House.\n\n\u201cBut if the facts reveal an increasing number of things that he has actually done, then of course impeachment is possible and removal from office is possible,\u201d he predicted.\n\nCarter, a one-term president whose predecessor only assumed the role after Richard Nixon resigned rather than face impeachment, denounced the Trump White House for routinely blocking and ignoring Democratic document and witness requests. He asserted that doing so was only to the president's detriment.\n\n\u201cI think that is one of the main things that Americans are now considering \u2014 the fact that the White House is trying to stonewall and not provide adequate information on which to base a good case to be made either for or against President Trump,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo I think that that in itself is going to be another evidence, another item of evidence, that can be used against him if he continues to stonewall and prevent the evidence to be put forward to the House of Representatives and the Senate to consider.\u201d\n\nGiving up on the blanket blockade in Democrats' deepening probe was among the advice Carter said he would give to the president as he stared down the prospect of impeachment. Carter implored Trump to give lawmakers and the public \"the evidence that we need to form a case either for or against him.\"\n\nIn addition to that, he said, \"my advice to him would be to tell the truth, I think, for a change and also to cut back on his Twitter feeds.\"\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/48/1c/6ec551a645d6ac72ab0970bb671b/191008-carter-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
