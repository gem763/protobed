They have some very high-quality players, areas of real strength and their entire squad will be lifted and energised by the prospect of a final.\n\nThe Boks' set-piece will be the strongest England will have faced at this World Cup, and off the back of that everything goes through Faf de Klerk at scrum-half, who is their conductor-in-chief.\n\nHe likes the box kick \u2014 does he ever \u2014 but we have all seen him star for Sale and he has another dimension up his sleeve. Watching club colleague Tom Curry mark De Klerk will be fascinating and he will be very alert to his sniping breaks which he kept under wraps on Sunday.\n\nSouth Africa could cause England problems through their set-piece play, and Eddie Jones' side will have to be wary of scrum-half Faf de Klerk and his box kick\n\nDoubts remain over whether South Africa's key man Cheslin Kolbe will be fit for the final\n\nThe Boks also have try-scoring potential out wide. Their back three have some gas and we wait to hear if there is any chance of key man Cheslin Kolbe returning form injury for the final.\n\nBut to my eyes their big weakness is a lack of creativity in midfield. Damian de Allende is a strong runner \u2014 he battered his way through impressively for his try \u2014 but England have already shown they can cut down strong runners all day long. England can absorb that approach easily and turn such players over at will.\n\nThe other huge takeaway is that England are capable of playing at a pace and tempo that could completely take the final away from South Africa.\n\nIf they can replicate the intensity and precision that they displayed against New Zealand then I am struggling to see how South Africa can match such an approach \u2014 it's a million miles away from their natural game.\n\nI would emphasise again, though, that it will be a major challenge for Eddie Jones' team to climb that Everest again just a week after the greatest ever England performance.\n\nEngland cannot under-estimate South Africa but if their pace could prove critical in landing a second world title. Pictured, Sam Underhill takes on New Zealand's Aaron Smith\n\nIf England can replicate their performance in victory against New Zealand again in Saturday's final then South Africa may struggle to match their approach\n\nEngland's preparation this week is all about getting that mental mindset right again and I was very encouraged with their determination to 'park' the win over New Zealand quickly on Saturday.\n\nBefore the Wales game I was chatting with Richie McCaw who was hugely complimentary about England, but he made the very pertinent point about 'going again' after an outstanding semi-final win.\n\nIn 2011 his New Zealand side were excellent in putting a good Aussie team away in their semi-final but seven days later they barely struggled over the line against a French team who had scraped past 14-man Wales in their semi-final. Backing up is unquestionably the key for England.\n\nIt was the same in 2003. In the England camp we enjoyed one of our most impressive ever performances in the semi-final when we despatched France with consummate ease but a week later back at the same ground we found life much more difficult against a pumped-up Australia.\n\nAs for Wales it was so near yet so far again. They gave it everything and when they started to play much better after the break and levelled the score at 16-16 I was utterly convinced they were going to pull off one of their trademark late wins.\n\nThe key moment for me was not the rather sloppy penalty they gave away for Handre Pollard to nudge over but a few minutes earlier when Rhys Patchell rather rushed a dropped goal attempt.\n\nIt was on, it was exactly the right call, and I know he has the reputation of striking a great long ball but he still needed to demand another 10 yards, two or three phases, from his pack. Patchell is a very fine player and will learn the lesson.\n\nI felt for head coach Warren Gatland just as I felt for New Zealand's Steve Hansen on Saturday night but their World Cup is not quite done.\n\nWarren Gatland will take charge of his final game as Wales manager in Friday's play-off\n\nSteve Hansen will also bow out as New Zealand boss following the match with Wales\n\nThe play-off match for third place is tricky \u2014 there have been a few duds over the years \u2014 but occasionally they spark up as was the case with France and Argentina in 2007.\n\nGiven that both Warren and Steve are signing off from their roles on Friday night, and given that there is no such thing as a meaningless 'friendly' between Wales and New Zealand, we might yet be in for a treat.\n\nIf any game can rise above the gloom that sometimes surrounds these play-off matches it will be a spirited encounter between two of the proudest rugby nations on the planet.\n\nI am confident that Friday night's game will be a true celebration of rugby that fans of all nations will enjoy and that would be in keeping with the whole atmosphere of this memorable World Cup.", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: If England can replicate the intensity and precision that they displayed against New Zealand then I am struggling to see how South Africa can match such an approach", "authors": ["Sir Clive Woodward For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/22/20257036-0-image-a-31_1572213796912.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
