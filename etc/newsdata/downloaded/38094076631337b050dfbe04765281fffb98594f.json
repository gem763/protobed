The result is a bid-ask spread for the average S&P 500 stock that is close to a multi-year high.\u201d\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch Liquidity drain in S&P 500\n\nThe rise of passive investing may create liquidity concerns because \u201cbuying and selling disciplines are determined solely by inflows and outflows,\u201d Subramanian wrote \u2014 think investors putting a predetermined portion of their incomes into a 401(k) account. Meanwhile, stock exposure has become abnormally concentrated in specific securities, creating a situation where there may be few buyers for these stocks once a market downturn occurs.\n\n\u201cAt an asset owner level, pension funds\u2019 exposure to private equity has risen demonstrably amid a reach for returns,\u201d she added. \u201cBut any disturbance to private markets (IPO friction, funding shocks via credit or rates) could force pensions to raise cash for distributions by selling the more liquid parts of their portfolios, namely public equities.\n\nSubramanian warns that liquidity concerns could cause trouble for markets during the first ten days of October, when investment funds tend to unwind positions for tax-loss selling and quarterly rebalancing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.86%, the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.79% and the Nasdaq Composite index COMP, -1.56% were all down more than 2.1% for the first two trading days of October, as of midday Tuesday.\n\nOct. 31st could be another date where liquidity concerns arise, as it\u2019s \u201cmandated cut-off for mutual funds to realize capital gains vis a vis the Tax Reform Act of 1986\u201d and Dec. 31st may cause trouble as it\u2019s the end of the fiscal year for most U.S. mutual funds.", "description": "A shortage of willing buyers and sellers of stocks could soon roil equity markets, according to a recent analysis by Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HK441_danger_ZG_20190529095200.jpg"}
