As an omen for the upcoming season, Ovi O\u2019s would seem to augur something sweet for the Capitals. Or something that borders on fantasy. Or maybe something retrograde and unoriginal. Ovi O\u2019s can be interpreted in any number of ways.\n\n[Guy Fieri\u2019s fried chicken stand at FedEx Field is a mess. A tasty mess.]\n\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious: Ovi O\u2019s are a clear homage to (or, less charitably, a rip-off of) Cheerios, specifically a riff on the brand\u2019s honey-nut variation. If you\u2019re going to copy someone, I guess it makes sense to copy the best: The Cheerios products are the top two sellers in America. No doubt Giant Food could not resist drawing a connection between Ovi and the puffy Os floating in your cereal bowl. I supposed O-Chex-kins was too much of a mouthful to sell.\n\nThere\u2019s something so overly optimistic about Ovi O\u2019s that it approaches fantasy. As both a marketing device and fundraising tool, Ovi O\u2019s are swimming against the tide. Sales of breakfast cereals are down six percent from five years earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported this summer. What\u2019s more, recent reports have indicated kids just aren\u2019t into cereal anymore, due to its poor value, its poor nutrition or the fact that parents treat sugar-laden cereals as the Antichrist.\n\nThe image of young Caps fans clamoring for Ovi O\u2019s \u2014 and obsessively reviewing the star\u2019s \u201cStats & Facts\u201d on the back of the package \u2014 seems as quaint and antiquated as a cardboard record pressed into a cereal box. This flagging relationship between cereal and young consumer may explain why Giant added a special Snapchat feature, in which users can use the app to scan the front of the box to reveal an interactive hockey game. You can control an animated Ovechkin as he slaps cereal pucks into a goal.\n\nThe @Capitals & @BaltiVirtual are at the forefront of creating entertaining augmented reality activations.\n\n\n\nScan a box of Ovi O's cereal w/ @Snapchat & #AR Alex Ovechkin appears for you to take target practice with.@ovi8 #ALLCAPS\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfd\ufe0f- @frntofficesportpic.twitter.com/6mwksYx7fr \u2014 AR & VR in Sport (@ARVRinSport) September 4, 2019\n\nMore than anything, though, I think Giant couldn\u2019t resist the allure of the Wheaties myth, this symbiotic relationship between breakfast cereal and elite athlete, each looking to capitalize on the other\u2019s assets. For generations, Wheaties has relied on Olympic champions, football stars and future Hall of Famers to sell boys and girls on the idea that their athletic greatness begins with a bowl of Wheaties in the morning. (Nevermind that, if those potential superstars were anything like me as kid, they would douse their Wheaties with enough sugar to make them taste like Frosted Flakes.) In return, these athletes would elevate their public image \u2014 or \u201cbrand\u201d as marketers now like to call it \u2014 with their faces plastered on the famous cereal boxes.\n\nYou have to give Ovechkin credit for using his cereal-box moment to raise funds for a foundation that, as a Giant news release notes, \u201cis committed to funding locally-based researchers, programs and facilities until every child is assured a healthy future.\u201d Ovi\u2019s a class act.\n\nSo how do Ovi O\u2019s taste? Sweet. Really sweet. The side of the box says that Ovi O\u2019s is packed with 12 grams of added sugars per 1 cup serving. For children, depending on their age and dietary needs, that could potentially cover their entire allotment of sugar for the day. This seems less a prescription for athletic success than a one-way ticket to a sugar crash. Which is one reason why I dropped this joke on Twitter:\n\nI\u2019ve had two bowls of Ovi-O\u2019s and my front tooth fell out. pic.twitter.com/aepzbhDYen \u2014 Tim Carman (@timcarman) September 25, 2019\n\nOvi O\u2019s are available at all 163 Giant Food stores while supplies last.
