Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. And, weak men create hard times.\u201d by G. Michael Hopf from his book, Those Who Remain. Deut 8:18 says, \u201cBut you shall remember the LORD your God, for it is He who is giving you power to make wealth, that He may confirm His covenant which He swore to your fathers, as it is this day.\u201d\n\nEveryone talks \u201cleadership,\u201d but few want to mentor and disciple others. I\u2019ve become weary of \u201cbestseller\u201d business content which is not truth-tellers because they do not anchor their content with any of the over 2,000 Bible verses regarding money and the marketplace. Maybe authors don\u2019t want to scare off unbelievers, or don\u2019t wish Biblical scholars or clergy to denounce their Biblical \u201cinterpretation,\u201d or that the clergy may fail to adequately translate Biblical interpretation into life applications toward marketplace ministries, i.e., \u201cfaith plus works.\u201d\n\nHowever, the lack of acknowledging God as our source in our prosperity to me is tantamount to not giving God credit He deserves for doing His part (1 Cor 3:7 says, \u201cGod who causes the growth.\u201d). I\u2019m a thought follower of His content, so that we can achieve prosperity for all.\n\nI met Steve Cruice, CPA, CFP\u00ae during a presentation I gave at a Business As Mission (BAM) breakfast meeting in the Spring. We talked afterward because he said (summarized), \u201cI have never heard what you have said about the parable of the talents, and I went to a Christian school and graduated with a business degree.\u201d We met for breakfast to discuss Biblical issues concerning work, prosperity, finance, and wealth creation. We hit it off discussing the same books we have read and the Biblical principles we strive to learn and apply in our lives and achieve as well as share and teach others. However, there was and is more; it boils down to this idea.\n\nBiblical discipline now or Biblical discipline later.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference? Growing up, I understood the meaning of the word of discipline as punishment from my parents for my wrongdoings. When I entered the military, the second meaning of the word came \u201cfront and center,\u201d discipline as training. Trained to be a part of something \u201cbigger than ourselves,\u201d to be a part of a team with a mission, and trained in military skills. However, it was not until I became an author, speaker, and Biblical entrepreneur that these two views, and the two different meanings came into a complete focus.\n\nProverbs 22:6 (AMPC) gives a rather interesting view of discipline and can be contrary to what Christians have come to understand the word discipline means. \u201cTrain up a child in the way he should go [and in keeping with his individual gift or bent], and when he is old he will not depart from it.\u201d Even the Tanach, the Stone edition, quotes the verse like this, \u201cTrain the youth according to his way: even when he grows old, he will not swerve from it.\u201d Strong\u2019s H2596 (Gesenius\u2019 Hebrew-Chaldee Lexicon) translates the word \u201ctrain\u201d as, \u201cto imbue some one with a thing, to instruct, to train up\u2026as to his manners and habits\u201d [emphasis added]. Discipline!\n\nIn other words, discipline for a child, or even an adult, is first considered to be training. Training first, punishment second. No wonder mothers speak more words than fathers; mothers have to repeat themselves to their children MANY times more than fathers. However, a good friend asked his wife about what words she used with their kids. \u201cHow many times do you tell them, \u2018NO!\u2019? Is there a different way to speak to say, \u2018YES!\u2019 to them?\u201d The same thing happens when you fail to train your children, to instruct them, to teach them. Having parents only tell their children, \u201cNO!\u201d can create fear in and for their lives instead of building up their confidence to prepare them to handle the pressures (good) or stresses (bad) of life.\n\nHowever, this leads to a different view of what we tell kids and others. Proverbs 18:21 says, \u201cDeath and life are in the power of the tongue, And those who love it will eat its fruit,\u201d and is echoed in James 3. I recently had a meeting with two businessmen; they spent more time beating up than building up, as if the old military saying were still valid, \u201cBeatings will commence until morale improves.\u201d I came away with the idea that their business habits might sometimes not exhibit the \u201cfruit of the Spirit.\u201d The discipline of training first, then the discipline of punishment next, but \u201cgo long\u201d on practice as it does not happen the first or second try, does it?\n\nA disciple of Christ means discipleship: dedicated to God to learn and be motivated to perform Godly habits based on His design of you and calling for you. To live out your faith in your life for the marketplace. This discipline is training per the concept of military standards such as the Navy SEALs or an F-15C/D fighter pilot. Not training like an amateur until you do it right once, but quality Biblical training, so you perform from muscle memory, so you don\u2019t get it wrong.\n\n\u201cThe shortcut is a lie. The hack doesn\u2019t get you there. [\u2026] There is no easy way. [\u2026] There are people in the world who have skills and strengths and talent that I will never have. [\u2026] These notions that you can \u2018be whatever you want to be as long as you want it bad enough\u2019 are not true. They are fairy tales. We all have limitations. [\u2026] [It] means that I am going to try to be the best that I can be. [\u2026] Better than I was yesterday. Better than people thought I could be. Better than I thought I could be.\u201d[1] It is having a growth and discipleship mindset.\n\n1 Tim 4:7-8 But have nothing to do with worldly fables fit only for old women. On the other hand, discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness; for bodily discipline is only of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come. For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.\n\nAs a disciple of Christ, eternal lives and rewards with His marketplace disciplines are at stake. Learning then sharing God\u2019s financial and marketplace wisdom and then inculcating and disciplining others with His good habits leads to prosperity for all.\n\nHeb 12:11 All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.\n\nWhere are the Biblical disciples to teach Biblical financial and entrepreneurial disciplines? To quote actor Ben Stein from Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off, \u201cAnyone? Anyone?\u201d\n\nWhy? \u201cThe answer is simple: The men that did not come home. [\u2026] I will live to honor their sacrifice\u2014a life worthy of the price they paid, for me, for us. I will not let them down.\u201d[2]\n\nPhil 3:14, \u201cI press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.\u201d\n\n[1] See Discipline Equals Freedom: Field Manual by Jocko Willink, pg 2, 70-71", "description": "There\u2019s a saying that describes the prosperity cycles of a .09/17/2019 19:21:54PM EST.", "authors": ["Kevin Cullis", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
