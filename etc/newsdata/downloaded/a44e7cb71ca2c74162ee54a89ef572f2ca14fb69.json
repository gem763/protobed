Agents have so many buyers on their lists that properties are pitched directly to them.\n\nAgents are encouraging potential buyers to make a high offer up to 15 per cent above the reserve price to drive off competitors for off-market deals and ahead of scheduled auctions.\n\nBut there is no guarantee unconventional strategies are going to secure a higher price than a traditional auction in competitive markets driven by falling borrowing costs and rising confidence.\n\nWhat is sharply tilting the market in favour of sellers are \u201cabnormal\u201d conditions causing supply to slip further behind demand, even in September, the first month of spring, when new listings traditionally rise, according to SQM Research, which monitors market prices.\n\nRapidly increasing prices during the past three months mean that underquoting could be on the rise as properties sell higher than real estate agents\u2019 quotes, which in Victoria are typically based on local sales during the previous three months, according to Damian Taylor, a buyer\u2019s agent for Morrell and Koren.", "description": "With so many properties selling on the quiet or ahead of auction, buyers and sellers need to be ahead of the game.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_2.3191%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_348/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7b60672aa559b875b9bb1a4eab0d0af228161f01", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
