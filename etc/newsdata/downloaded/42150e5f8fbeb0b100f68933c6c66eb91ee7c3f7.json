QUEEN.\"\n\nWhile no reason was given for her removal of the flippant post, it may have to do with Felicity Huffman's prison sentence.\n\nHuffman, 56, was sentenced to 14 days behind bars after she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud in May.\n\nLORI LOUGHLIN WAS 'OBSESSED' WITH GETTING DAUGHTERS INTO USC, REPORT CLAIMS\n\nThe \"Desperate Housewives\" star admitted to paying an admissions consultant $15,000 to have a proctor correct her older daughter's answers on the SAT.

Giannulli, 56, and Loughlin then were slapped with additional charges of money laundering and conspiracy and may face up to 40 years behind bars if convicted on all charges.\n\nA source admitted recently that Loughlin regretted not accepting a plea bargain following Huffman's sentencing.\n\nLORI LOUGHLIN, MOSSIMO GIANNULLI'S LAWYERS SLAM 'BASELESS ALLEGATIONS' OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\n\"[Loughlin] didn\u2019t understand the entire nature of the charges against her, and she wasn\u2019t even sure if or how she had broken the law. It was very early, and she didn\u2019t have all the information that she has now,\" the source said. \"Based on what she understood at the time, she made the best choice for herself. Now there is no deal on the table, and she has to have faith that the courts and the prosecution will move fairly and not make an example out of her.\"\n\nFor her part, Olivia Jade rumored to be avoiding social media for a full year following the arrests of her parents, but she posted a tribute to mom Loughlin for the actress' 55th birthday in July before posting the rude body language snap.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFollowing Loughlin's arrest, Olivia Jade lost several endorsement deals, including sponsorships with Sephora, TRESemm\u00e9 and Est\u00e9e Lauder.", "description": "Lori Loughlin's daughter Olivia Jade deleted an Instagram post in which she flipped the bird at the media amid her mom's college admissions scandal.", "authors": ["Jessica Sager"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/06/olivia-jade-giannulli-cellphone.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
