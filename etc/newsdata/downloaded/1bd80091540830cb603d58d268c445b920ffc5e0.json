On the other side of the Channel, EU negotiators who once dismissed him as \"a clown\" now take him seriously and believe he may yet pull it off.\n\n\"He\u2019s closer than they have ever been,\" an EU diplomat said after a weekend of high drama in the British parliament, where Johnson on Monday was pushing for a vote on his deal after an unexpected delay on Saturday.\n\n\"If there is anyone who can do it in the House of Commons, it\u2019s him. If not, we will be back to square one in a few days or weeks,\" the diplomat said.\n\nJohnson's ability to overcome deep European scepticism and salvage the stranded negotiating process was forged during an off-the-record countryside stroll with Ireland's leader, Leo Varadkar, on Thursday, Oct. 10.\n\nJohnson's turnaround, insiders on both sides of the talks said, came after the process was on the verge of collapse on Tuesday, Oct. 8.\n\nJust a week earlier, the European side had rejected outright Johnson's latest proposal to resolve the persistent sticking point of how to deal with the border between Northern Ireland, part of the UK, and Ireland, which remains part of the EU, after Brexit without upsetting a decades-old peace deal.\n\nJohnson's suggestions were vague and lacked legal foundation, the EU side had said.\n\nThe crisis over the so-called Irish backstop, intended to prevent a hard border on the island, seemed insurmountable three weeks before Britain was set to crash out without an agreement.\n\nThe low point came during an acrimonious phone call earlier on Oct. 8, when German Chancellor Angela Merkel bluntly told Johnson that the EU would not accept customs checks on the island of Ireland.\n\nDetails of the confidential call quickly leaked from a source at 10 Downing Street, upsetting the Germans. Fuming at Merkel's suggestion, Johnson's aides unleashed their fury, breaking every diplomatic code in the book and texting reporters: \"They aren't engaging or negotiating seriously.\" Another Downing Street source said a deal was \"essentially impossible\".\n\nBy lunchtime that day, a taunting tweet from European Council President Donald Tusk added a sense of peril: \"At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis?\"\n\nTusk was telling Johnson he was marching into disaster of a split without an agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC-Understanding the Irish border - https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-EU/0100B2HZ1TJ/index.html\n\n\n\n\n\nOUT OF THE WRECKAGE\n\nAt that precise moment Johnson broke from the orthodox Brexit playbook his predecessor Theresa May had stuck to unsuccessfully for more than two years.\n\nThat evening, after the Merkel call that one EU diplomatic source called Johnson's \"rendezvous with reality,\" he rang Varadkar to set up a meeting.\n\nIt \"came out of the wreckage of the Merkel call,\" one UK source familiar with the conversation said. \"We were in the last roll of the dice territory at that stage.\"\n\nIt turned out to be a political masterstroke from the same man who had been on a path of brinkmanship just days before.\n\n\u201cJohnson left the call feeling the way to a deal was through Varadkar\u2019s heart. But time was running out and he decided clearly to do the impossible \u2013 reopen the backstop, get a deal and campaign on a platform of having delivered an orderly Brexit,\" said an EU official directly involved in Brexit talks.\n\nThey agreed to meet at Thornton Manor, a rustic Elizabethan house near Liverpool in northwest England, where the two strolled side by side down a grassy, tree-lined path among artistically manicured gardens.\n\n\u201cThey spent at last half of the three-hour meeting one-on-one,\" one Irish source said. \"Boris emerged looking for coffee after about 45 minutes and went back in again.\"", "description": "BRUSSELS/DUBLIN/LONDON(Reuters) - In 90 days as British prime minister, Boris Johnson has been humiliated in parliament, drawn mass street protests, tasted heavy defeat in the courts and suffered significant departures from his government, including his own brother.
