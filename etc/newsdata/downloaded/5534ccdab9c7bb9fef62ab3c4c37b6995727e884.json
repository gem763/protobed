Photo: Courtesy of the retailer\n\nI\u2019ll never forget my astonishment at losing four pounds in the first two weeks of Fitbit-wearing. These fitness trackers translate activity and sleep patterns into graphs and stats (and, if you like, offer prompts to do better); as a result, my sedentary habits went from invisible to staring me in the face. It also helps that I can compare my step-count tally with other Fitbit wearers I know (father, wife, sister-in-law, work friends) in the phone app. It\u2019s health through humiliation.\n\nThese days, Fitbit offers three fitness bands; the latest and least expensive, the Inspire HR, debuted earlier this summer. The beauty of the Inspire HR is that, in essence, it combines the best of its pricier siblings \u2014 the aesthetics of the Alta HR and the guts of the Charge 3 (both of which I also own) \u2014 making it ideal for those who are new to Fitbits as well as seasoned wearers who think it\u2019s time for an update.\n\nFrom left, the author\u2019s Charge 3, Inspire HR, and Alta HR Fitbits. Photo: David Pogue\n\nAt first, I was a fan of the $130 Alta HR, the brand\u2019s stylish, incredibly skinny bracelet that, despite its svelte frame, still has room for parts to track your steps, sleep stages, and heart rate. I\u2019m not the only one who thinks the Alta HR\u2019s thin profile is a big part of its appeal; Strategist senior writer Karen Iorio Adelson is a fan of it, too. But eventually, I gave up on the Alta HR \u2014 it\u2019s not waterproof, the screen is dim, and the heart-rate monitor gives a few people (including me) wildly inaccurate readings during more strenuous exercise. So I upgraded to the top-of-the-line, $150 Fitbit Charge 3 tracker instead. It\u2019s much wider, but I thought it was much better \u2014 that is, until I got the Inspire HR.\n\nAt only two thirds of an inch wide, the Inspire HR splits the size difference between the Alta HR and the Charge 3 \u2014 and yet it has almost the same guts as the latter. It\u2019s got a more sophisticated heart-rate sensor than the Alta HR. It tracks steps, activity, sleep, calorie burn, heart rate, exercise minutes, and (for women) monthly periods. It has a brighter screen, and can show incoming text messages and notifications. It offers guided relaxation breathing and GPS tracking for your runs (provided your phone is nearby). The corresponding app for iPhone or Android is terrific (my opinion of the app never wavers, no matter the model I wear).\n\nAs with the other Fitbits, the Inspire HR accommodates a huge array of inexpensive straps, in all kinds of styles and materials. Oh, and mine has lasted no less than nine days on a charge. (Take that, Apple Watch!) If you look at the Inspire from the side (which you never do), you can see that the bottom isn\u2019t flat; it\u2019s got a bulge on the back. In addition to storing the guts, the bulge serves to press the heart sensor gently against your skin, so the Inspire never loses contact like certain other trackers (cough \u2014 Alta HR \u2014 cough). Yet, to my surprise, even with that bulge, the Inspire HR sits flatter on my wrist than the Alta HR.\n\nGiven that it\u2019s two thirds the price and width of the Charge 3, you\u2019d expect to be sacrificing some things if you go for an Inspire HR, and you do: metal side panels (the Inspire is plastic) and stairway counting (the Charge contains an altimeter). But that\u2019s it. As for me, I\u2019m thrilled to save the 50 bucks \u2014 and to reclaim a third of an inch of wrist skin.\n\nA parting detail: There\u2019s also a roughly $70 version of the Inspire \u2014 with no \u201cHR\u201d in the name \u2014 that lacks the heart-rate sensor. I\u2019d skip that model, because the sensor is not only essential for tracking your cardio health, but also critical to the Inspire\u2019s excellent sleep-stage measurements.\n\nA few more Fitbit Inspire HRs\n\nFitbit Inspire HR $92 (was $100, now 8% off) If you\u2019re not a fan of the black strap and don\u2019t want to buy one in another color, Amazon is currently offering a 20 percent-off discount on the exact same Inspire model shown above with a white strap. $92 at Amazon Buy $92 at Amazon Buy\n\nFitbit Inspire HR $95 (was $100, now 5% off) And here\u2019s the same exact Inspire HR, but in a soothing lilac [Editor\u2019s note: Amazon currently has a low stock of these.] $95 at Amazon Buy $100 at Walmart Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
