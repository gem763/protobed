They\u2019re Just Looking for Love.", "language": "en", "text": "MOUNT DIABLO STATE PARK, Calif.\u2014Pity the male tarantula in October. He\u2019s weak from starvation and desperate for love. The object of his desire lives underground, forcing him to wander around until he stumbles over a female, who may kill him after mating. First, he may stumble into horrified humans.\n\nWarm weather in the San Francisco Bay Area has extended tarantula mating season\u2014a surprisingly public affair that has led to advisories from officials to be on the lookout for thousands of giant male spiders. The spiders aren\u2019t dangerous to people, in fact it\u2019s the other way around. That message is proving a tough sell around Halloween.\n\n\u201cSome people really make them out to be the devil, but they are gentle giants,\u201d said Michael Marchiano, a volunteer naturalist for the Mount Diablo State Park, doing his part to improve public relations for a creature he calls misunderstood.\n\nThe thought of tarantula armies on the march unnerves many people. \u201cNope! Not going to San Francisco this month,\u201d Michael Hallden-Abberton, a retired chemist from Maple Glen, Pa., tweeted over the weekend. He says he\u2019s not afraid of tarantulas one at a time, but the idea of so many crawling around the Bay Area got his attention.\n\nA sign at the entrance to a trail in Mount Diablo State Park tells visitors: \u201cTarantula venom is very mild and won\u2019t harm you\u2014unless you\u2019re the size of a small lizard or cricket.\u201d\n\nSome locals are facing their fears head-on.\n\nThis week, Mimi Victor knelt down on a dusty hiking trail one evening at Mount Diablo park\u2014a hot spot for the giant arachnids\u2014to get a closer look at a wild tarantula.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d the 10-year-old from Fair Oaks, Calif., said softly, as the three-inch spider crawled along. \u201cBe careful,\u201d said her father, Rich Victor, as her mother and their two other children looked on with wide eyes.\n\nKen Lavin, left, a volunteer guide at Mount Diablo State Park, talks about tarantulas with E.J.

Coarsegold, Calif., in the Sierra Nevada foothills is planning its annual Tarantula Festival on Oct. 26. Among the activities: a \u201cScream-off Contest\u201d and \u201cHairy Leg Contests (Both men and women).\u201d\n\nThe Henry W. Coe State Park near Morgan Hill, Calif., hosted its annual Tarantula Fest on Oct. 5. Guests were encouraged to \u201crub elbows (so to speak) with some of our fuzzy, friendly eight-legged guests of honor.\u201d\n\nNatalie Knowles, of Aliso Viejo, Calif., had intended to take her daughter for a simple nature hike this week in Mount Diablo park. Instead, she stared nervously as 7-year-old Malaika held a three-inch tarantula in her cupped hands as its owner, volunteer hiking guide Ken Lavin, talked soothingly about the animal at a picnic table.\n\nHe keeps the tarantula for educational purposes. \u201cEveryone, I think, is born with an innate fear of tarantulas,\u201d he said, \u201cbut very few spiders can break a human\u2019s skin.\u201d\n\nFor many, that\u2019s beside the point.\n\n\u201cWas it creepy crawly feeling?\u201d Ms. Knowles, 30, asked her daughter after the tarantula retreated back to Mr. Lavin. Malaika thought a moment, and responded: \u201cIt felt light, and when it got off I felt the claws.\u201d\n\nTarantulas have gotten a bad rap, defenders say, in part because of the way they have been portrayed by movies. The 1955 monster film, \u201cTarantula!,\u201d depicted a giant tarantula whose deadly rampage was stopped when it was incinerated by napalm from Air Force fighter jets.\n\nShare Your Thoughts You see a tarantula. You run, scream, both? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cHollywood and the media have made tarantulas seem monstrous, so to many people these slow-moving spiders appear ominous and threatening. Nothing is farther from the truth,\u201d the Mount Diablo park website says. \u201cNorth American tarantulas have a very mild venom that can easily paralyze a small arthropod but it is totally harmless to humans.\u201d\n\nMost tarantulas neither bite hard nor are considered particularly venomous to humans. They can release barbed hairs if threatened, but are so small that they serve only as an irritant to skin, according to the World Animal Foundation, a nonprofit based in Vermilion, Ohio.\n\nMale tarantulas are on the move during mating season.

The males, on the other hand, go on to die soon after mating between age 4 and 7\u2014in some cases immediately after sex at the fangs of their mate.\n\n\u201cIf the female is hungry she may make her anxious suitor her next meal,\u201d states a tarantula fact sheet from the National Park Service.\n\nTarantulas themselves face numerous threats. One is from habitat destruction due to development, which has reduced their numbers, Mr. Marchiano said. One of its most deadly foes is the tarantula wasp, whose sting leaves the arachnid paralyzed but still alive\u2014until it is consumed by the wasp\u2019s offspring.\n\nMalaika Knowles, 7, holds a captive female tarantula, used for educational purposes.

It turned out to be a male tarantula, trying to hide in some grass\u2014just feet away from what Mr. Lavin figured was the burrow of a female. It was surrounded by humans.\n\nWrite to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com", "description": "Warm weather in the San Francisco Bay Area has extended the spider\u2019s mating season, leading to efforts to rehab its image; \u2018gentle giants\u2019", "authors": ["Jim Carlton", "Jim.Carlton Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-114900/social", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
