Rugby World Cup team of round two 1/15 1, Ellis Genge (England) The loosehead prop may have only come on for England at half-time, but there had not been a run at the World Cup from a prop quite like what Genge produced against the USA. A barn-storming run saw him outpace one defender and trample over another, breaking the best part of 50 metres before it took two men to stop him. He was also excellent in the scrum to win countless penalties as the USA wilted. AP 2/15 2. Julian Montoya (Argentina) It takes something special to shine in Agustin Creevy\u2019s absence, but Montoya delivered with an excellent hat-trick to help lead Argentina to victory over Tonga. Montoya was smart to stay wide following a lineout for his first try, was the beneficiary of the rolling maul for the second and powered his way over from close range for a classy 26-minute hat-trick. AP 3/15 3. Levan Chilachava (Georgia) It\u2019s not often a Georgian makes the team of the round, but Chilachava lead an inspired Georgian pack to dominate Uruguay in their Sunday clash, scoring a try in the bonus-point victory and monstering the opposition front row in the scrum.

Lood de Jager (South Africa) The Springbok needed a big performance to strengthen his case for selection in what is a very competitive area for South Africa, and the giant second row delivered emphatically with a man-of-the-match performance. He may not have got on the scoresheet, but his impact in destroying Namibia\u2019s gameplan was standout nonetheless. AP 6/15 6.

AP\n\nJones was sat next to Owen Farrell, who received a second heavy blow to the head in as many games following Tomas Lavanini\u2019s 19th-minute high tackle that saw the Argentine lock sent off by referee Nigel Owens. The collision followed a similar one during the win over the United States, which saw US flanker John Quill shown a red card, but for the second game running Farrell did not undergo a head injury assessment [HIA] as the England medics did not suspect he had a concussion.\n\nHowever, Farrell played down any concerns for his well-being.\n\n\u201cI feel fine,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously concussion that\u2019s the worry but I didn\u2019t get hit anywhere near the top of the head. Maybe your jaw gets a bit sore but I was fine and there was no need for a HIA.\u201d\n\nJones continued his stance of not commenting on the decision, claiming that they should be left up to the referees, but Owens was vindicated in how he dealt with the sending off by Argentina boss Mario Ledesma.\n\n\u201cIt had a big impact because it was so early in the game, but I thought it was fair,\u201d said Ledesma, who also believed that England could have had Manu Tuilagi sin-binned for tackling Emiliano Boffelli in the air. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a yellow card, sometimes it\u2019s not, but it\u2019s more if you fall to the ground on your shoulder or neck, and the ref called it a penalty so we move on.\u201d\n\nArgentina\u2019s tighthead prop Juan Figallo, who plays alongside a number of England stars at Saracens, concurred with his head coach. \u201cWe were hoping it was just a yellow but it was a clear red,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to deal with that and we tried and tried but it's tough to play a game in a World Cup with 14 men. Tomas isn't feeling great but we support him. It was an unlucky tackle, 10 centimetres down and it was a great tackle.\n\n\"We thought Manu's tackle was a yellow card. That could have helped us because it was early in the game but it was the ref's decision and I won't say anything about referees. We have to deal with that.\"\n\nDespite scoring another six tries to add on to the 11 they scored against Tonga and the US, Jones believes his squad must continue to keep improving if they are to beat France and make it a clean sweep in Pool C, with that game next Saturday at the International Stadium Yokohama next Saturday a shoot-out for top spot.\n\nThe Australian did highlight that the reduction in numbers for Argentina had a galvanising effect on the South American side.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just worried about France next week,\u201d added Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s qualification for the quarter-finals but our emphasis is just about getting better for the next game.\n\n\u201cWhen Argentina went down to 14 men, they possible had a psychological lift and it\u2019s human nature that we dropped off a little bit because you think you\u2019re going to win the game. I was really pleased with how the players came back in the second half and dominated. If you\u2019d have said we\u2019d have 15 points after three games, we\u2019d be pretty happy.\n\n\u201cWe're just happy with the way we stuck at the game, we didn't get carried away. That's a banana skin game for us. You have to remember that three years ago we beat Argentina with 14 men after Elliot Daly got sent off. We won the game easily with 14 men. You've got to be careful, so I was really pleased with the leadership of the team.\u201d\n\nJones also confirmed that it is unlikely that he will be able to fly home to Australia on Friday to attend the funeral of his close friend Jeff Sayle, with the Randwick rugby great passing away last Monday at the age of 77.\n\nIt is feasible that Jones could leave Tokyo on Thursday evening after naming his side and return on Saturday morning in time for England\u2019s Pool C decider against France, but those plans appear unlikely to materialise.\n\n\u201cUnless the RFU hire a concord for me, it\u2019ll be quite difficult to go,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m negotiating with BA, concord and he RFU to see what we can do. Obviously I\u2019d like to go but I\u2019ve got a lot of responsibility here. I\u2019m conscious of that. The travel makes it difficult so I doubt very much that I\u2019ll be going, as much as I\u2019d like to.\u201d", "description": "England will wait nervously on the fitness of Billy Vunipola after he was forced off at half-time of the 39-10 victory over 14-man Argentina, which sealed their place in the quarter-finals with a match to spare.
