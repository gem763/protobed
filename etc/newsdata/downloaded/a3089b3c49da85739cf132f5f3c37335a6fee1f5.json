(Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nColumnist\n\nImagine if, back in 2011, President Barack Obama had not only withdrawn all U.S. forces from Iraq, facilitating the rise of the Islamic State, but also invited Islamic State leaders to Camp David to sign an agreement cementing his withdrawal plan. Obama\u2019s decision to pull out American troops was catastrophic, but even he was not dumb enough to seek a photo op with terrorists. Yet this is precisely what President Trump tried to do when he initially invited the Taliban to Camp David for a meeting this past weekend.\n\nHere is the image that would have been broadcast across the Muslim world: Taliban leaders sitting at the very table where U.S. officials planned the overthrow of their regime, accepting what they would have portrayed as the terms of the United States\u2019 surrender \u2014 right before the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The propaganda victory for the Taliban would have been enormous, sending a message of U.S. weakness and emboldening terrorists across the world.\n\nIt gets worse. The Taliban team with whom the Trump administration has been negotiating includes five senior Taliban commanders \u2014 the \u201cTaliban Five\u201d \u2014 who were held at Guantanamo for 13 years before Obama freed them in exchange for U.S. Army deserter Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. They include Mullah Fazel Mazloom, who according to his Guantanamo military file is \u201cwanted by the UN for possible war crimes while serving as a Taliban Army Chief of Staff\u201d and has \u201coperational associations with significant al-Qaeda and other extremist personnel.\u201d They include Mullah Norullah Noori, \u201cwanted by the UN for possible war crimes\u201d and \u201cassociated with members of al-Qaeda.\u201d They include Abdul Haq Wasiq, Taliban deputy minister of intelligence who \u201cutilized his office to support al-Qaeda and to assist Taliban personnel elude capture \u2026 [and] arranged for al-Qaeda personnel to train Taliban intelligence staff in intelligence methods\u201d and \u201cassigned al-Qaeda members to the Taliban Ministry of Intelligence.\u201d They include Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa, who was \u201cdirectly associated to [Osama bin Laden] and Taliban Supreme Commander Mullah Muhammad Omar.\u201d And they include Mohammad Nabi Omari, \u201ca senior Taliban official\u201d who was \u201ca member of a joint al-Qaeda/Taliban [anti-coalition militia] cell in Khowst and was involved in attacks against U.S. and Coalition forces,\u201d including one that killed two Americans.\n\nThese are murderous terrorists with American blood on their hands. It is an outrage that Obama freed them. But for Trump to even consider allowing leaders of a designated terrorist organization to set foot in Camp David is worse than an outrage; it is an insult to all those who died on 9/11 and the American troops who gave their lives fighting them in Afghanistan.\n\nIt was only the Taliban\u2019s brutality \u2014 launching a suicide attack that killed an American service member on the eve of the Camp David summit \u2014 that prevented this debacle from unfolding. After the attack, Trump canceled the summit and tweeted, \u201cWhat kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position?\u201d Terrorists, Mr. President \u2014 that\u2019s who.\n\nTrump\u2019s defenders say this would have been no different from his diplomacy with Kim Jong Un, or his offer to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Yes, it is. First, Kim and Rouhani are heads of government. Taliban leaders are terrorists. They claim to be the heads of a state \u2014 the \u201cIslamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\u201d Hosting them at Camp David grants them undeserved legitimacy.\n\nSecond, in the cases of North Korea and Iran, Trump is acting from a position of strength. He has imposed crippling sanctions on both regimes. With the Taliban, he\u2019s negotiating from a position of weakness. He wants to get out of Afghanistan, and the Taliban knows it. A peace deal would not be a victory for the United States; it would be a victory for the Taliban.\n\nThe administration claims that the Taliban had agreed to break with al-Qaeda and prevent them from reestablishing a haven in Afghanistan. The Taliban made the same promise in the 1990s, before 9/11. After the attacks, its leaders were given a choice: Break with al-Qaeda, or lose your regime. They chose to lose their regime. The Taliban will never break with al-Qaeda. As retired Gen. Jack Keane has made clear, the Taliban and al-Qaeda are brothers. Taliban leaders are telling al-Qaeda: Lay low. We\u2019re getting the Americans to leave. Then you can come back.\n\nBy killing an American soldier, Taliban leaders were rubbing the United States\u2019 defeat in Trump\u2019s face. That move backfired. Trump now says the Taliban talks \u201care dead.\u201d Let\u2019s hope so \u2014 and that with the death of those talks dies one of the most shameful moments of the Trump presidency.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump\u2019s Camp David cancellation offered temporary relief from a bad deal\n\nMax Boot: Trump proves he\u2019s a better dealbreaker than dealmaker \u2014 this time, with the Taliban\n\nJennifer Rubin: Trump\u2019s invitation to the Taliban was disgraceful.
