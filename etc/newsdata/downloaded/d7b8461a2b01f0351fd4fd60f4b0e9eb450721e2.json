(AP) - No. 23 California wants to remain unbeaten, while Mississippi is seeking to make a statement with a win against a ranked team.\n\nCal can start the season 4-0 for the first time since 2015 if the Golden Bears are able to walk away with a road victory Saturday at Ole Miss (2-1).\n\nAlthough the campuses are separated by over 2,000 miles, these programs are familiar with each other. They faced off just two seasons ago at Cal, with the Golden Bears scoring 20 unanswered points in the second half to win 27-16 at home.\n\n\u201cThey have some really talented players that jump off the tape,\u201d Cal coach Justin Wilcox said. \u201cThey have a couple of coaches we are familiar with and have competed against a lot. They have really good players and coaches. It will be a great challenge for our team in all three phases.\u201d\n\nOle Miss is aiming for its first victory over a Top 25 team since beating No. 16 Mississippi State 31-28 in 2017.\n\nThe Rebels\u2019 chances of winning this one depend on whether they can solve a Cal defense that has held each of its last 10 opponents below 24 points. That stretch includes a 20-19 road upset of No. 22 Washington, which was ranked 14th at the time.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s defense features linebacker Evan Weaver, whose 41 total tackles lead all Football Bowl Subdivision players.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about this opportunity, a chance to have a top-25 team coming into Oxford,\u201d Ole Miss coach Matt Luke said \u201cCal is a very good football team. Watching them on tape, the first thing that jumps out is how good and physical they are on defense. They have one of the best secondaries we\u2019ll face all year.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things to know about Saturday\u2019s Cal-Ole Miss matchup.\n\nVAUNTED BEARS SECONDARY\n\nQuarterback Matt Corral and the Ole Miss offense have struggled to find consistency in the passing game. That passing attack faces perhaps its toughest challenge yet against a veteran California secondary that features Jaylinn Hawkins, who has seven career interceptions.\n\nOle Miss receivers coach Jacob Peeler was an assistant coach at California from 2013-2016. He\u2019s very familiar with the California secondary that has become the strength of the team.\n\n\u201cEvery one of those kids was there when I was there,\u201d Peeler said. \u201cAshtyn Davis was actually a receiver before moving to defense. Hawkins was recruited as a receiver. The rest of them, (Camryn) Bynum, Josh Drayden are all very good. Their accolades are certainly well deserved.\u201d\n\nOle Miss\u2019 Elijah Moore has 18 receptions this year, but no other receiver on the Rebels\u2019 roster has more than four.\n\nCOULD EARLY KICKOFF TIME HAVE IMPACT?\n\nThis cross-country trip will be no easy task for Cal as it prepares to play in the sweltering Mississippi heat in a game that will kick off at 9 a.m. Pacific time.\n\nWilcox said the bears will begin to get adjusted to central time by waking up earlier on Wednesday. The Golden Bears planned to depart for Oxford on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe will get our body clocks started on Wednesday,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cThe early start won\u2019t be an issue and we will hydrate like crazy.\n\nTOUGH CONDITIONS\n\nThe game-time temperature is expected to be around 90 degrees, and that also could be a factor.\n\nCorral is a southern California native and acknowledged the heat is much different in Mississippi than it is out west. He believes it will take the Golden Bears some time to adjust to the warm temperatures and says that could have more of an impact than the early kickoff time.\n\n\u201cThe heat is different, I\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d Corral said. \u201cA nice 70 degrees at practice versus it being 80 at six o\u2019clock in the morning and even hotter at practice in the afternoon. There is a big difference. But at the end of the day, we have to put the football down and play.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "No. 23 California wants to remain unbeaten, while Mississippi is seeking to make a statement with a win against a ranked team.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Rippee"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/aptopix_north_texas_california_football_90349_c0-161-3857-2409_s1770x1032.jpg?f9a83b8be9dc0bf483621240dc92b800088cb8f6", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
