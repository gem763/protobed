But Republicans argued the bill would stifle economic opportunities for the rural areas of the state.\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee and author of the legislation, said plans to jumpstart mining in the area are \u201cnot theoretical and not trivial.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese critical protections are under threat from the Trump administration under the guise of energy dominance and fabricated arguments of national security they\u2019ve continued to push for these lands to be opened to exploitation on behalf of a few wealthy mining interests,\u201d he said Tuesday during House floor debate.\n\nGrijalva\u2019s bill does not have companion legislation in the Senate, and the White House issued a veto threat, saying the administration opposes \"such a large, permanent withdrawal, which would prohibit environmentally responsible development.\"\n\nThe vote on the bill, the Grand Canyon Centennial Act, comes as a White House working group organized to examine uranium supplies is considering recommending invoking a Cold War-era law that mandates the federal government buy uranium for enrichment for national security purposes.\n\nTheir recommendations, expected next month, could prompt the White House to lift a 20-year mining moratorium from 2012 that protected nearly 1,562 square miles outside the boundaries of the Grand Canyon.\n\nDemocrats have argued the U.S. does not need to tap into U.S. uranium reserves since many imports of the mineral come from allies like Canada and Australia.\n\n\u201cNational security experts said this fear mongering about supplies is based on fantasy,\u201d Grijalva said Tuesday. \u201cWe shouldn't be mining for uranium around the Grand Canyon. Period.\u201d\n\nRepublicans argued that Democrats have been exaggerating the risks the the Grand Canyon.\n\nThey unsuccessfully fought to delay enactment until the Department of the Interior issued a report concluding that would not increase imports \"from hostile countries like Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Namibia.\"\n\nRep. Bruce Westerman Bruce Eugene WestermanTrump administration to repeal waterway protections Congress needs to pass Sara's Law so the next Sara Kruzan is met with empathy, fairness The results are in: How the nation voted on criminal justice issues that impact our youth MORE (R-Ark.) said much of the land that would be protected isn\u2019t close to the park.\n\n\u201cThis bill is very cleverly named to make it sound like it's safeguarding the Grand Canyon, something I believe we all support,\" Westerman said on the House floor Tuesday. \"But when we look at what it does, we quickly see it has very little to do with the Grand Canyon. Instead, it\u2019s a federal land grab that would lock up approximately 1 million acres of land in northern Arizona and permanently ban mineral development.\"\n\nA working group organized by the White House that is examining uranium supplies is taking into consideration a Cold War-era law that, if invoked, mandates the federal government buy uranium for enrichment for national security purposes.\n\nIf the White House decides to adopt that suggestion, it could overturn a 2012 mining ban that put nearly 1,562 square miles off limits outside the boundaries of the Grand Canyon.\n\nRepublicans see mining opportunities as a path for communities surrounding the Grand Canyon, particularly Native American ones, to focus their economies on more than just tourism.\n\nRep.
