(AP) - The Latest on California legislative action (all times local):\n\n5 p.m.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers are on the verge of approving legislation to trim prison sentences for repeat nonviolent felonies.\n\nCurrent law adds an additional year to offenders\u2019 sentences for each previous prison or jail term.\n\nThe bill approved by the state Assembly on Thursday would remove the mandatory one-year enhancement. The bill returns to the Senate on Friday for a final vote.\n\nSupporters say the longer sentences clog prisons and jails, are costly to taxpayers, and do little to deter criminals.\n\nOpponents including several Democrats say the longer sentences are needed for repeat offenders.\n\nCorrections officials say about 10,000 inmates currently have the one-year bumps in their sentences. Legislative analysts say the change could save tens of millions of dollars a year in lower prison and jail costs.\n\n___\n\n3:20 p.m.\n\nCalifornia is looking to tighten the rules about children under 13 using social media.\n\nThe state Senate voted 31-4 on Thursday to require social media companies to first get the consent of a parent or guardian before creating an account for a child the company knows is under 13.\n\nFederal law already requires social media companies to get parental consent before collecting or selling data of children under 13. That\u2019s why most social media companies, including Facebook, already ban children under 13 from creating accounts.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Henry Stern says the bill will protect children. But Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener says the bill would harm LGBT youth who live in abusive households by isolating them from others like them.\n\nThe bill now heads to the state Assembly.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on California legislative action (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
