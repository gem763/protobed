Tutanota claims that a similar social credit system is already in place in the West, it\u2019s just not as obvious:\n\nOf course, no one calls it social credit system, but if you think about it, it\u2019s already here: The insurance company that calculates your risk premium based on information gathered from social media. The bank that calculates your financial credibility and, thus, your interest rates, based on information provided by the Schufa (German system). AirBnB and Uber disabling accounts, for example if a home owner or driver reported you for \u2018bad behavior\u2019, without giving you any choice to appeal. These are just some examples that clearly show that some form of social credit system is already established. There are companies that gather information about you that lead to consequences based on this information. That\u2019s basically the same as a social credit system. The only difference to the looming Chinese system is that it is not yet inter-connected. If Uber blocks you, you can still use a Taxi. If one insurance asks for a high premium, you can try to get another. But what if this changes?\n\nTutanota states that as it currently stands, individuals online actions are tracked by their web browsers, third parties via cookies and almost all sites that they log into such as Google and Facebook. The group states that the \u201centire internet is a mere surveillance machine\u201d that collects data given freely by users and creates profiles for them based on their online actions. According to the report, currently this information is only used for targeted advertising, but what if it was used for more than that?\n\nThis virtual profile of yours will lead to real-life consequences: You might not get the loan you need to buy a home because of a bad social credit. You might not get a car insurance, and thus, are stuck with public transport because of a bad social credit. Most people think that these consequences will not affect them because they lead a good life. After all, that\u2019s the aim of any social credit system: force people to lead a good life. And what\u2019s so bad about this? The problem is the definition of \u2018good\u2019: For companies \u2018good\u2019 might imply people who are recurring customers, who buy too much and spend too much. For governments \u2018good\u2019 might mean people who follow the rules and don\u2019t speak up. Ever. No matter what the government decides.\n\nTutanota states that \u201cAny social credit system \u2014 be it private or public \u2014 undermines freedom of speech,\u201d and encourages users to keep their private data private. One of the ways that users can do this is by leaving Facebook and Google, here\u2019s how they suggest that users do that.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
