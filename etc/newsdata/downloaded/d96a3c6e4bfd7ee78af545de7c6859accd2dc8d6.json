There were an astonishing 81 kicks in 80 minutes of play.\n\nMaybe over-awed by the occasion, world-class players seemed unable to collect the simplest of balls cleanly, resulting in 12 scrums, many of which had to be reset several times.\n\nIn contrast to the England-New Zealand semi-final, when the crowd barely had time to breathe, the dreaded Mexican wave was deployed after only 20 minutes of dire rugby and the most noise they made was belting out \u201cSweet Caroline\u201d at half-time.\n\nBoth camps admitted it wasn\u2019t great for the neutral. \u201cThere was not a lot of flowing rugby played,\u201d said Welsh coach Warren Gatland, adding that the Springboks \u201cmight have to be a bit more expansive\u201d to beat England in the final.\n\nMan-of-the-match Handre Pollard, the Springbok fly-half, said there were no regrets about their style of play. \u201cGrinding it out is something we believe in. That\u2019s what it takes to win play-off games and World Cups,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 Size doesn\u2019t matter \u2013\n\nOne of the biggest cheers of the night was when livewire Springbok scrum-half Faf de Klerk \u2014 who was again a constant threat \u2014 squared up to giant Wales lock Jake Ball, their mismatched confrontation beamed onto the stadium big screen.\n\nAs a boxing bout, it would not be allowed. De Klerk, instantly recognisable with his flowing blonde locks, stands 5ft 7in (1.72m) and weighs 13st 12lb (88kg). Ball, equally unmissable with his shaggy beard, is 26 centimetres taller and 36kg heavier.\n\nThe two grabbing each other\u2019s shirt collars nose-to-nose with De Klerk grinning broadly may prove to be one of the images of the tournament and became an instant social media hit \u2014 one wag comparing it to famous cinema kisses.\n\nDe Klerk said it was important to show that even though he is the shortest man on the pitch, he was not cowed. \u201cWe are great friends mate, it was just a nice moment between us,\u201d joked the scrum-half after the match.\n\n\u2013 Nerveless Pollard \u2013\n\nAgain fly-half Handre Pollard ended up being the difference between the two sides, winning his kicking battle with opposite number Dan Biggar \u2014 just like in the 2015 World Cup quarter-final.\n\nIn that match at Twickenham, Pollard scored 18 of his team\u2019s 23 points, with five penalties and a drop goal.\n\nFast forward four years to Yokohama and it was a faultless performance by Pollard again \u2014 four penalties and a conversion giving him a total of 14 points, including the tricky final kick at 16-16 that sealed it for the Springboks.\n\n\u201cThere were some nerves of course,\u201d admitted Pollard, stressing however that he had trained for the mental challenge of kicking under pressure.\n\n\u201cYou want to be in those position as a fly-half and as a kicker. You want to have that pressure on you and you execute.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Brutal Bok \u2018bomb squad\u2019 \u2013\n\nCoach Rassie Erasmus again selected six forwards among his eight replacements and it paid off for him once more with a stunning defensive effort at the death from fresher legs.\n\nThe likes of RG Snyman, Francois Louw and Frans Steyn made the difference as Erasmus even hauled off his captain Siya Kolisi for the \u201cfinishers\u201d \u2014 or \u201cbomb squad\u201d as they are known in the Springbok camp.\n\n\u201cThere were a few contributions from guys that came off the bench that made massive differences,\u201d said Erasmus.\n\n\u2013 Bittersweet for Alun Wyn \u2013\n\nIt was a bittersweet evening for Welsh captain Alun Wyn Jones who won his 142nd international cap (his British and Irish Lions appearances included), drawing him level on second place in the all-time list with Italy\u2019s Sergio Parisse.\n\nHe can go one better if, as expected, he is selected for the 3rd place play-off game against the All Blacks \u2014 only legendary New Zealand captain Richie McCaw ahead of him on 148.\n\nVisibly emotional at the end of the game, the hulking giant said:\u201d It wasn\u2019t our day but I\u2019m still proud to pull this jersey on and represent all the people in red in the stadium.\u201d", "description": "Yokohama (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 It wasn\u2019t much of a spectacle, but it had a hugely tense finish as South Africa slotted a penalty with four minutes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/2f2c76_south-africa-edged-wales-place-in-world-cup-final-we-learned-wales-south-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
