While Diablo 3 and The Witcher 3 seemed ambitious games to port to Switch at first, they've been praised for their ability to bring huge, intensive games to a small, portable screen. But developer CD Projekt Red doesn't think it'll continue the trend with Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nSpeaking to Gamespot at PAX Australia, John Mamais, head of Krakow's office, confirmed a lot of things about the upcoming cyberpunk RPG, including his concerns about Australia's classification system and the potential of introducing post-release micro-transactions.\n\nIt's Not Clear If Cyberpunk 2077 Will Have First Person Sex Scenes Cyberpunk 2077, releasing April 2020, asks the big questions about our technology-driven future and what it means to be human. Also, it has tatas and badonkadonks out the wazoo \u2060\u2014 but some mixed messaging from the studio has left fans confused as to whether all the cut scenes will be in first person.

I guess we'll see,\" Mamais told Gamespot. \"If we decide to put it on the Switch, if we can do it. Probably not.\"\n\nBut look, it's probably not a huge loss right now as experiencing games as huge as Cyberpunk 2077 on PC or consoles \u2014 the platforms it's designed for \u2014 tends to give players a better experience. It might not be a portable experience but it's going to give you a better appreciation of the scale of things without having to fit it all into a 6.2-inch (or the Switch Lite's 5.5-inch) screen. The Witcher 3 on Switch lets you enjoy the game on the fly but you'll have to sacrifice the original impressive graphics for a Vaseline-smeared glaze.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is expected come to Everything Not Nintendo Switch on April 18, 2020.", "description": "There seems to be a trend in porting big console and PC games to the cute but powerful Nintendo Switch.
