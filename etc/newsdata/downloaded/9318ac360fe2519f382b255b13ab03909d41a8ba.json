Kavanaugh testifying in front of the Senate Judiciary committee last September regarding the allegations of sexual assault made against him. Photo: Erin Schaff/Getty Images\n\nIn 2018, Brett Kavanaugh nearly derailed his own confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court. Not long after Donald Trump announced Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, the public soon learned that the would-be justice hid a sordid history of youthful, alcohol-soaked behavior. Christine Blasey Ford credibly accused Kavanaugh of holding her down on a bed and attempting to rape her while they were both in high school. Later, Deborah Ramirez, who attended Yale University with Kavanaugh, told the New Yorker that Kavanaugh had exposed his penis to her at a party. Despite their claims, Kavanaugh\u2019s hostility to the Senate Judiciary Committee and inconsistencies in his testimony, the Senate voted to confirm him to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nBut Ramirez, it turns out, may not have been the only Yale student to get an unwanted look at the justice\u2019s penis. In an excerpt from their new book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh, New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly reveal that in a letter to the FBI, attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford said that they\u2019d become aware of another incident involving a woman named Tracy Harmon Joyce. Harmon Joyce attended Yale at the same time as Kavanaugh, and the reporters describe her as a \u201cclose friend\u201d of Ramirez. In the letter, Ford\u2019s attorneys said the justice \u201cexposed himself\u201d to Harmon Joyce, then \u201cforced her to touch his penis,\u201d Ford\u2019s attorneys wrote, and added that witnesses who were present would be contacting the FBI with their accounts. Pogrebin and Kelly write that it\u2019s \u201cnot clear\u201d how Ford\u2019s attorneys learned of Harmon Joyce, but they also report that Max Stier, who also attended Yale with Kavanaugh, Ramirez, and Harmon Joyce, \u201cprovided the same report to legislators,\u201d though he did not discuss it with the press. The FBI didn\u2019t follow up on the tip.\n\nHarmon Joyce did not discuss the alleged incident with Pogrebin and Kelly, though the reporters write that \u201cseveral\u201d of her friends say that she does not remember the incident in question. But in a written statement, she described Ramirez as a person of \u201cintegrity and character\u201d who is \u201chonest to a fault.\u201d\n\nThat isn\u2019t the only new detail to emerge from Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s book. Their reporting lends credence to many of the most serious concerns raised about Kavanaugh\u2019s suitability to serve a lifetime term on the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\nAt the time of the Kavanaugh incident, Deborah Ramirez told her mother that \u201csomething happened\u201d at Yale\n\nPogrebin and Kelly write that Ramirez felt out of place at Yale. She came from a working class background, and her new classmates frequently picked on her because of her Puerto Rican heritage. When Kavanaugh put his penis in her face, she told the reporters, it wasn\u2019t just a violation. It was confirmation that she didn\u2019t belong in the tony Ivy League. Her mother, Mary Ann LeBlanc, says that at the time of the incident, Ramirez met her in a restaurant, crying. Ramirez didn\u2019t disclose the full extent of the incident; according to LeBlanc, all Ramirez could manage is that \u201csomething bad\u201d had happened to her at Yale. Other Yale classmates confirmed that they had either witnessed the incident or heard about it directly afterwards. One, Kenneth Appold, told the reporters that according to the version he heard, Kavanaugh promptly tried to expose himself again after Ramirez pushed his penis away. Appold had previously spoken to the New Yorker about portions of the incident.\n\nThere are new details about the night of Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s alleged attack\n\nPogrebin and Kelly interviewed Blasey Ford for the book. Though Blasey Ford can\u2019t recall the specific location of the house, her account of the assault remains clear and detailed. The house had two stories, she said, but it didn\u2019t have much furniture, or seem like anyone really lived in it. Kavanaugh\u2019s friend, Mark Judge, seemed \u201cnervous.\u201d When she tried to use an upstairs bathroom, someone pushed her into a bedroom; the book doesn\u2019t specify who did it. But Kavanaugh and Judge were in the room, and they locked the door behind them. We already know what happened next, in painful detail, because Blasey Ford already told us about it. But there\u2019s a new detail. When she got home from the party, after escaping Kavanaugh and Judge, she found that her father was awake. Too afraid to tell him what it had happened, she snuck past him to get to her bedroom.\n\nAfterwards, she spiralled. Her grades suffered. Her relationships suffered. Later, she moved to California, and never lived on the East Coast full-time again.\n\nFirst interview with Leland Keyser, who dated Mark Judge\n\nAt the time of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings, Blasey-Ford had identified Keyser as a high school friend who was present at the fateful party. Keyser told the Judiciary Committee that she recalled neither the party or Kavanaugh, though she believed Ford. Keyser told the reporters that she still believes that \u201csomething\u201d traumatic happened to Ford, just that Kavanaugh wasn\u2019t responsible. But Keyser may now embrace her role as a hero to the right-wing. The reporters note that Keyser kept a framed copy of a National Review article in a bathroom. Its headline: \u201cWas Leland Keyser The Hero of the Kavanaugh Controversy?\u201d\n\nFord had some support in Silicon Valley\n\nThe Chevy Chase crowd may have closed ranks around Kavanaugh, but Ford wasn\u2019t entirely friendless. Pogrebin and Kelly report that Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, had recommended a list of attorneys to Ford. Later, when Ford and her friends traveled to Washington D.C., Mark Pincus, the founder of Zynga, and Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn, allowed Ford and her friends to use their private plane. \u201cWe believed then, as we do now, that is important to take seriously accusations of violence against women,\u201d Hoffman told the reporters.", "description": "In \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d two New York Times reporters shed new light on an explosive confirmation fight, including the existence of an additional allegation of assault against the Supreme Court Justice", "authors": ["Sarah Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2018/10/02/02-brett-kavanaugh-rage.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
