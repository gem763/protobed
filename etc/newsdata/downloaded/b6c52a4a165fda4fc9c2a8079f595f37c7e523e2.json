He made the first relief appearance of his career, taking over for starter Max Scherzer.\n\nThe right-hander Strasburg says he\u2019s fully recovered from the wild-card game and ready to go. He was 18-6 with a 3.32 ERA and threw an NL-high 209 innings during the regular season.\n\nBy starting Strasburg in Game 2, he\u2019s available to return on normal rest for a potential Game 5 next Wednesday back in Los Angeles.\n\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts says with Kershaw going in Game 2, the left-hander would be available to possibly pitch out of the bullpen if Game 5 is necessary.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Washington manager Dave Martinez says Stephen Strasburg will start Game 2 of the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Beth Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/brewers_nationals_baseball_39688_c0-92-2211-1381_s1770x1032.jpg?1a9bcdd6f0711cd477a08d2d01a3cebb2153296a"}
