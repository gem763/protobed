Moreover, it was believed that landmines had been placed there by the Khmer Rouge regime in the 1970s, causing scientists to stay away.\n\nHowever, the research efforts from the scientists revealed the city that had been there.\n\n\"We should soon be able to construct finer-grained demographic models and finally resolve basic questions concerning the extent and population of Angkor, and how that changed over the centuries,\" the report concluded.", "description": "Researchers uncovered an ancient city in Cambodia.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/angkor-wat-temple-cambodia-file-gty-jef-191018_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
