Tuesday\u2019s occurred on the first anniversary of the Lion Air flight 610 crash in Indonesia that killed 189 people. In March, after an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crashed, killing 157 people, the 737 Max was grounded worldwide, and Muilenburg pledged such accidents would not happen again.\n\nBut he was subjected to withering questioning from US politicians from both sides of the political aisle, in the first of several planned hearings and further investigations into Boeing\u2019s conduct over the top-selling jet.\n\nBoeing was accused of putting profits over safety and developing a cosy relationship with regulators that permitted the company to rush the 737 Max, Boeing\u2019s most profitable model, into service.\n\n\u201cBoth of these accidents were entirely avoidable,\u201d the Mississippi senator Roger Wicker, a Republican, said. \u201cWe cannot fathom the pain experienced by the families of those 346 souls who were lost.\u201d\n\nLast week, an Indonesian report into the Lion Air crash criticized the design of the anti-stall system that left pilots fighting for control, as well as \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the flight crew\u2019s communication and manual control of the aircraft.\n\nThe Ethiopian Airlines crash led to the grounding of the aircraft. That decision is estimated to have cost Boeing as much as $9bn.\n\nAt the hearing, the Connecticut Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal sharply accused Boeing of engaging in \u201ca pattern of deliberate concealment\u201d, noting that Boeing\u2019s 1,600-page pilot\u2019s manual mentions the so-called MCAS anti-stall system just once. Blumenthal accused Muilenberg and Boeing of supplying \u201cflying coffins as a result of Boeing deciding to conceal MCAS from pilots\u201d.\n\nAt issue are recently disclosed internal instant messages that Boeing had not previously handed to committee investigators. The messages, sent by Boeing\u2019s chief test pilot Mark Forkner in 2016, complained of \u201cegregious\u201d erratic behavior in flight simulator tests of the MCAS system, and referred to \u201cJedi mind tricks\u201d to persuade regulators to approve the plane.\n\nBoeing chief to admit company made mistakes over 737 Max Read more\n\nMuilenburg claimed he was not fully briefed on the details of the messages until a \u201ccouple of weeks ago\u201d despite the company knowing of the exchange before the Ethiopian airlines crash.\n\nThe Texas Republican senator Ted Cruz called the test pilot\u2019s exchange \u201cshocking\u201d and accused Boeing of withholding knowledge of the systems faults from regulators.\n\nCruz said: \u201cHow come your team didn\u2019t come to you with their hair on fire, saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got a real problem here\u2019? What does that say about Boeing? Why did you not act before 346 people died?\u201d\n\nLawmakers accused Boeing of selling safety as an \u201cadd-on feature\u201d, referring to a warning light that advises pilots of any discrepancy in the aircraft\u2019s pitch, which was sold as an add-on rather than included as standard.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be the leader in aviation manufacturing you have to be the leader in safety,\u201d offered the Washington senator Maria Cantwell, the committee\u2019s top Democrat.\n\nThe committee has said it plans to change the program that gave Boeing, rather than regulators, authority to sign off on aspects of the jet.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t \u2018sell\u2019 safety, that\u2019s not our business model,\u201d Muilenburg claimed under questioning. \u201cWe have learned that we\u2019ve made mistakes, and there are things we can improve. We take responsibility for that, we own that, we\u2019ve made fixes going forward.\u201d\n\nAs the first Boeing official to testify on Capitol Hill about the crisis engulfing the company, Muilenburg said that since the 737 Max was grounded, the company has conducted extensive testing with updated software.\n\nSeveral other inquiries are also expected to report soon, including an international panel convened by the Federal Aviation Authority, the US regulator, to recommend changes to the way planes are certified. There is also a looming criminal investigation by the US justice department.\n\nAsked if Boeing could have done more after the first 737 Max crash, Muilenburg said: \u201cI think about that decision over and over again. If we knew then what we know now we would have made a different decision.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth, a former military pilot, questioned why Boeing did not disclose more details about anti-stall system\u2019s lack of safeguards.\n\n\u201cYou have told me half-truths over and over again,\u201d Duckworth said. \u201cYou have not told us the whole truth and these families are suffering because of it.\u201d\n\nDuckworth said the pilots did not know enough about the anti-stall system. \u201cYou set those pilots up for failure,\u201d she said.\n\nReuters contributed to this report", "description": "Under-fire Dennis Muilenburg subjected to withering questions from angry committee members about flaws in anti-stall system", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa4845de9e3a76895b35710e7612431758d5fd85/0_76_2751_1651/master/2751.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8e2b7ca3d08442ac29c8f8609baf3ba6", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
