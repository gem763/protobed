Trading volume ballooned to over 24 million shares, compared with the full-day average of about 4.2 million shares.\n\nThe company, which makes industrial vending machines, tools and other manufacturing and construction equipment, reported net income for the quarter to Sept. 30 that increased to $213.5 million, or 37 cents a share, from $197.6 million, or 34 cents a share, in the year-ago period, topping the FactSet consensus of 35 cents a share.\n\nSales increased 7.8% to $1.38 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $1.37 billion, amid higher unit sales and higher product pricing.\n\nMeanwhile, gross margin fell to 47.2% from 48.1% a year ago, because of increased sales of lower-margin products, inflation and higher freight expenses.\n\nFastenal managed to beat expectations, although the company said that the \u201cgeneral slowing in economic activity,\u201d which resulted in a profit and sales miss in the second quarter, \u201ccontinued in the third quarter of 2019.\u201d\n\nSee related: U.S. manufacturers experience worst month since 2007-2009 Great Recession, ISM finds.\n\nAlso read: Service side of the economy grows at slowest price in 3 years, ISM finds, adding to recession worries.\n\nChief Executive Daniel Florness said in the post-earnings conference call with analysts that he believed the growth in product sales was a \u201ctremendous accomplishment\u201d in an economy \u201cwhere things have weakened.\u201d\n\nThere was a hiccup in the company\u2019s business, however, that Florness said he decided to bring up, basically in the interest of full disclosure.\n\n\u201cThat is, the one item in the quarter that kind of makes me scratch my head is our construction business,\u201d Florness said. \u201cThat growth has slowed dramatically as we\u2019ve come into 2019 and in all honesty, we don\u2019t completely understand it.\u201d\n\nFastenal Co.\n\nHe said the weakness seemed to be concentrated in the company\u2019s smaller customer accounts, as the larger account business continues to grow well. Although some of the weakness in local businesses can be attributed to the closing of 5% of locations a year, Florness said that\u2019s not a new phenomenon, as the closings have been happening for the past four to five years.\n\nFlorness said he talked to peers that sell into the same arena, and they have also observed that while their larger accounts aren\u2019t seeing the weakness, their smaller account businesses are slowing as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of an observation than a conclusion,\u201d Florness said. \u201cI apologize for that.\u201d\n\nWith Friday\u2019s gain, Fastenal\u2019s stock has now run up 39% year to date. Meanwhile, the SPDR Industrial Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLI, +2.61% , of which Fastenal is a component, has rallied 20% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.74% has advanced 19%.", "description": "Shares of Fastenal Co. soared toward a record high Friday, as the industrials company managed to fend off a continued slowing in economic activity and a...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT171_Fasten_MG_20191011133139.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
