We are still playing this out. The second phase is a nice long, steady climb with lowish volatility. (The 3rd stage is mania when volatility goes out of control).

That's the best time to deploy capital or go long with high certainty,\" he said.\n\n____\n\nOther reactions:\n\n$BTC has moved +42% today \u2014 Alex Kr\u00fcger (@krugermacro)\n\nIf we close at 10k we'd be looking at the 3rd highest 1D return in Bitcoin's history (38%), surpassed only by 11/6/\u2026 https://t.co/HZsNix7qkN \u2014 nic carter (@nic__carter)", "description": "The Cryptoverse is stunned.
