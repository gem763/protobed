This is completely false, misleading, and downright disgraceful.\n\nHowever, the CDC goes on to state, \u201cBased on initial data \u2026 we know: Most patients have reported a history of using e-cigarette products containing THC.\u201d And here is the crux of the matter, which the media has completely downplayed and ignored: the vast majority (if not all) of the recent hospitalizations are due to people consuming unsafe and illegal substances with a completely safe and legal vaping device.\n\nIn essence, the scandalous fake news media is driving a completely false narrative that legal vape \u201cpods\u201d are the sole cause of these health problems. Once again, as far as we know, almost every case to date has involved illegal, black market, or homemade vape pods containing who knows what\u2014not the commonplace, legal pods one can purchase at convenience stores and vape shops.\n\nFor those unaware of how vaping generally works, here is a short tutorial. Vaping devices, unlike far-more-harmful (95 percent more harmful, to be exact) combustible tobacco cigarettes, do not contain tobacco or any of the other chemicals proven to cause cancer. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, \u201cThese products use an \u2018e-liquid\u2019 that may contain nicotine, as well as varying compositions of flavorings, propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, and other ingredients. The liquid is heated to create an aerosol that the user inhales.\u201d\n\nThe fake news media and mindless politicians have declared war on vaping. This is incredibly stupid and dangerous. This could drive thousands of adults to abandon vaping and return to far more harmful, and deadly, tobacco cigarettes. Even worse, untold numbers of teenagers (and pre-teens) are likely to begin vaping because it has been stigmatized as \u201cdangerous\u201d by authorities.\n\nIn case you are unaware, when you tell a teenager not to do something because it is dangerous, you just increased its \u201ccoolness factor.\u201d As a former high school teacher, I am all too aware of this phenomenon. Although it seems counterintuitive, if we actually wanted to reduce youth vaping rates, it would probably be better for more authorities to tout vaping as safe.\n\nFor purposes of full disclosure, this author is a former heavy smoker. Although I quit smoking cigarettes years ago, I am keenly aware of the addictive nature of nicotine. However, as a current vaper, I am also well aware of the health benefits legal vaping offers.\n\nThe fake news media and foolish politicians are doing us all a major disservice by unfairly portraying legal vaping as a potentially dangerous (or life-threatening) habit. This is utterly untrue and these authority figures should know better.\n\nFlavor bans and other misguided legislation will do absolutely nothing to reduce the unfortunate cases tied to the vaping of illegal substances. Unfortunately, idiotic flavor bans, like those recently undertaken in Michigan and New York, are nothing more than feel-good pseudo-solutions that will do much more harm than good.", "description": "Over the past few weeks, the fake news media and .09/22/2019 1:12:15AM EST.", "authors": ["Chris Talgo", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/159/51fe884c-0e94-443d-9cce-1c96615d5c79.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
