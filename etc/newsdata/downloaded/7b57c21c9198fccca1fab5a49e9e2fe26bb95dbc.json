The suspension has since spread to some sororities, business fraternities, and other organizations including the school\u2019s marching band and rugby club.\n\nThe new allegations were obtained Thursday by The Associated Press through a public records request. Ohio University said it has lifted or eased restrictions against some fraternities and organizations as its investigation continues.\n\n\u201cThis process is ongoing, and as more or different information comes forward, the University may decide to lift or impose additional restrictions as applicable,\u201d the school said in a statement dated Oct. 24.\n\nThe Interfraternity Council that governs the school\u2019s fraternities didn\u2019t immediately respond Friday to messages seeking comment.\n\nIn May, the university expelled Sigma Pi fraternity for hazing, alcohol and drug use, and other student conduct code violations after the alleged hazing of an 18-year-old student who died last November. Sigma Pi said the student wasn\u2019t a pledge when he died.\n\nThe school, based in Athens, Ohio, released a series of complaints from current and past students about alleged hazing. The school withheld their identities.\n\n\u201cBecause hazing is power-based and many times the people experiencing hazing want to continue to belong to their organization, reporting is often anonymous,\u201d the school said in a statement. \u201cRegardless of the manner in which the information is reported, we review each and every allegation and make independent decisions regarding each one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are countless incidents each year, and thousands of scared girls guilted into not coming forward,\u201d an alumnus who participated in a sorority at the school said in her complaint.\n\nThere were several reports of pledges being forced to stay secluded in basements for days at a time. Others claimed that pledges were made to rise before dawn and run five miles around campus. Others allegedly had to exercise or carry weights while intoxicated. And there were several accounts of people being forced to clean houses.\n\nThere were repeated allegations of forced excessive drinking. One person alleged that a sorority made female pledges undress and undergo body-shaming by Sharpie-wielding sorority sisters.\n\nThe men\u2019s rugby club allegedly had new members run naked and rub their genitals on cars.\n\nHowever, at least one student said he didn\u2019t have any issues with the process of becoming a fraternity member.\n\n\u201cI think joining this fraternity has opened my mindset to trying new things and to keep trying new things because you\u2019ll never know exactly what you like and what fits you until you try,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI also think this process has made me more social and more outgoing.\u201d\n\nUniversities across the country have struggled in recent years to curb hazing. In August, two former fraternity brothers served time for misdemeanor hazing in connection with the alcohol poisoning death of a Louisiana State University student in 2017.\n\nIn April, three Virginia State University fraternity members were accused of hurting 10 students who were being hazed.\n\nAt Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, a student this year said he was beaten with a spiked paddle, kicked and forced to drink lots of alcohol during a Delta Tau Delta chapter initiation. Miami suspended the fraternity in August for 10 to 15 years after its investigation determined violations of the school\u2019s Code of Student Conduct.\n\n___\n\nFollow Dan Sewell at https://www.twitter.com/dansewell\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ohio University students have made allegations of being forced to drink excessively, strip, and endure grueling exercise and long periods of confinement during an ongoing probe into hazing.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Sewell"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
