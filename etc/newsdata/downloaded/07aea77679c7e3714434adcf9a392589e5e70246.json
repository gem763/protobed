REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\n(Reuters) - Japan and the United States intend to enact their recent trade agreement in January, Nikkei reported on Friday, citing Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. wants [the trade deal] to be in effect on Jan. 1, 2020, and we have no objections to that,\u201d Motegi said in an interview to Nikkei.\n\nLast month, U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signed a limited trade deal that cuts tariffs on U.S. farm goods, Japanese machine tools and other products while further staving off the threat of higher U.S. car duties.\n\nThe trade pact needs ratification by Japanese lawmakers and the accord will go before Japan\u2019s parliament once it convenes for an extraordinary session on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe hope to gain their (lawmakers\u2019) approval after a thorough explanation,\u201d Motegi told Nikkei.\n\n\u201cThe deal strikes a balance between agricultural and industrial products. We were able to attain a win-win outcome for both Japan and the U.S.,\u201d the minister added.", "description": "Japan and the United States intend to enact their recent trade agreement in January, Nikkei reported on Friday, citing Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436852392&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9302D", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
