But a common symptom of cardiac arrest is agonal breathing, which can look like the person is gasping or snoring.\n\nHere is an actor demonstrating what agonal breathing might look like. If you would think \u201coh, he fell down but he\u2019s breathing, he\u2019s ok,\u201d please know that a person in this situation needs a 000 call and CPR.\n\nThis is why CPR classes actually tell you to watch out for a person who is \u201cnot breathing normally.\u201d Agonal breathing is not normal breathing; it\u2019s a reflex that happens when the brain is not getting enough oxygen.\n\nIn a sense it\u2019s a good sign, because it means the person\u2019s brainstem is still active. People who have agonal breathing during a cardiac arrest are more likely to survive than people who don\u2019t, although the sad truth is that odds are low no matter what.\n\nWhat to do if you see someone collapse and gasp\n\nIf a person collapses in front of you, and they\u2019re gasping, groaning, or snoring, it\u2019s time to take action. (You can skip checking for a pulse, which just takes extra time. If the person is actually alive and well, they will push you away or tell you to stop.) If you have had recent CPR training, do whatever you were trained to do. For most of us, the general advice is to:\n\nBegin hands-only CPR (fast chest compressions, to the tempo of Stayin\u2019 Alive)\n\nHave someone call 000\n\nIf possible, have someone look for an AED (automated external defibrillator) device\n\nArizona\u2019s Sarver Heart Centre notes that agonal breathing may actually be better than mouth-to-mouth resuscitation at getting air into the chest. So there\u2019s no need to breathe into the person\u2019s mouth. Hands-only CPR is the preferred method now anyway.\n\nI learned about agonal breathing thanks to this Twitter thread by Anne Marie Cunningham, a doctor who recently saw someone go into cardiac arrest and initially mistook what was happening. She shared some facts about agonal breathing and linked the video above. She said: \u201cI\u2019m a trained health professional and if I didn\u2019t immediately recognise a cardiac arrest neither might you.\u201d", "description": "I\u2019ve taken a few CPR classes, and I admit I walked away with the mistaken impression that a person who needs CPR will be unresponsive and not breathing at all.
