Courtesy of SoFi\n\nThe stock market is not the best place to keep money for short-term goals if you're worried about a recession, says Lauren Anastasio, a financial planner at SoFi.\n\nIf you have investments you'll need to cash out in the next two to four years to fund a short-term goal, it may be a good time to move the money into a high-yield savings account.\n\nA high-yield savings account can keep that money completely safe, accessible, and even help it steadily grow.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nDespite most metrics indicating the United States economy is doing well right now, there's widespread speculation that a recession is on the horizon.\n\nAs long as you have a cash safety net to fall back on should you lose your job or face an unexpected expense, there's little reason to panic, says Lauren Anastasio, a certified financial planner at SoFi, a personal-finance company.\n\nIn fact, a recession can be a huge opportunity to make money if you're invested for the long term, she says. Investing in stocks while prices are low means you can take advantage of an inevitable market upswing down the road.\n\nBut while it may be a good time to funnel savings into retirement accounts, which have years to rebound before you'll need the money, it's not a good time to keep money for short-term goals in the stock market, Anastasio says.\n\n\"If that goal or when you plan to use that money is any time in the next two to four years, that's a scenario where it may make sense to move out of the market and be in a high-yield savings account or stay in cash, simply because you've been saving and investing for a purpose and at this point your time horizon isn't long enough that if we do experience a downturn, there isn't enough time to rebound from that,\" Anastasio says.\n\nCommon short-term goals include making a down payment on a house, having a baby, paying for a big vacation, starting a renovation project, planning for a lapse in regular income, or going back to school. By keeping the money you need for those goals in the stock market, there's a high chance you'll wind up with less than you invested when there's a market downturn. A high-yield savings account can keep that money completely safe, accessible, and even help it steadily grow.\n\nAs Anastasio says, the best position to be in during a recession is one where you can virtually ignore the balance in your investment accounts.\n\n\"Knowing that their investment accounts could basically go untouched and it doesn't matter if it drops 50% and then at some point it eventually rebounds, if they have the wherewithal \u2014 not the willpower, because most of us have a hard time resisting looking at the accounts \u2014 but if they have the ability to ignore the noise and ignore the fluctuations because they're not in a position where they have to sell out of the market because they need the cash, that's the situation someone wants to be in,\" she says.", "description": "The stock market is not the best place to keep money for short-term goals if you're worried about a recession, says Lauren Anastasio, a CFP at SoFi.", "authors": ["Tanza Loudenback"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d7013612e22af2a3242ef93?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
