NASA has moved up the first all-female spacewalk to Thursday because of a power system failure at the International Space Station. (NASA via AP)\n\nThe spacewalk will be broadcast in its entirety from 6:30 a.m. EDT (10:30 GMT) on National Aeronautics and Space Association (NASA) Television and on the agency's website.\n\nKoch and Meir are replacing the BCDUs after they failed to provide increased power to the ISS, though this has not significantly impacted the crew or its mission.\n\nAccording to NASA, BCDUs regulate the charge for batteries that draw energy from the station's solar collectors to provide power as the station orbits at night.\n\nKoch, who is also set to complete the longest single spaceflight by a woman as she remains in orbit until February 2020, said gender milestones like the spacewalk were especially significant.\n\nLast week NASA astronaut Christina Koch (right) conducted a spacewalk at the Port-6 (P6) truss structure work site to replace the Space Station's Solar Array Batteries\n\n'There are a lot of people who derive motivation from inspiring stories from people who look like them, and I think that it\u00b4s an important aspect of the story to tell,' she told a NASA briefing in Houston this month.\n\n'What we\u00b4re doing now shows all the work in the decades prior from all the women that worked to get us where we are today,' Meir added.\n\nKoch, who was slated for the earlier spacewalk, will be making her fourth walk and will become the 14th woman ever to walk in space. Friday will mark Meir's first spacewalk. The ISS has seen more than 200 spacewalks since 1998.\n\nChristina H. Koch, left, and Meir greet each other after Meir's arrival on the International Space Station\n\nThe March spacewalk was called off because astronaut Ann McClain needed a medium spacesuit but only a large was available. Due to safety issues with the fit she did not participate.\n\n'We must never accept a risk that can instead be mitigated,' she said on Twitter after the event. 'Safety of the crew and execution of the mission come first.'\n\nAt the time the cancellation drew widespread criticism, including from former U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton and global activism group March for Science.\n\nNASA astronauts Christina Koch (L) and Jessica Meir (R) in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, September 2019\n\nWoman spacewalks date to July, 1984 when Russian cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya became the first to do so. Russian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov conducted history's first spacewalk in 1965.\n\nWhile Friday's event is a long time coming, NASA said it was not purposefully planned.\n\n'It is something that was bound to happen eventually, and the increase in female astronauts in space for the past year is providing another window of opportunity,' its spokeswoman said.\n\n'Fifty percent of the 2013 astronaut candidate class are women,' she noted, 'and of the 11 members of 2017 astronaut candidate class still in training, five are women.'", "description": "The pair will exit the International Space Station at 12:50pm BST to fix the station's faulty battery charge/discharge unit (BCDU) over a period of more than five hours.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/11/19753002-0-image-a-72_1571307768758.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
