Carroll played Julia Baker, a nurse whose husband had been killed in Vietnam, in the groundbreaking situation comedy that aired from 1968 to 1971.\n\n\"Diahann Carroll walked this earth for 84 years and broke ground with every footstep.

Extraordinary life. Thank you, Ms. Carroll.\"\n\nAlthough she was not the first black woman to star in her own TV show (Ethel Waters played a maid in the 1950s series Beulah), she was the first to star as someone other than a servant.\n\nNBC executives were wary about putting Julia on the network during the racial unrest of the 1960s, but it was an immediate hit.\n\nAs it Happens: Suzanne Kay remembers her mother Diahann Carroll\n\nSuzanne Kay shares memories of her mother Diahnn Carroll, the first black woman in history to star in her own TV series who died today at the age of 84, with As It Happens guest host Nil K\u00f6ksal. 7:44\n\nIt had its critics, though, including some who said Carroll's character, who is the mother of a young son, was not a realistic portrayal of a black American woman in the 1960s.\n\n\"They said it was a fantasy,\" Carroll recalled in 1998.\n\n\"All of this was untrue. Much about the character of Julia I took from my own life, my family.\"\n\n'A profile regal enough to belong on a coin'\n\nNot shy when it came to confronting racial barriers, Carroll won her Tony portraying a high-fashion American model in Paris who has a love affair with a white American author in the 1959 Richard Rodgers musical No Strings.\n\nCritic Walter Kerr described her as \"a girl with a sweet smile, brilliant dark eyes and a profile regal enough to belong on a coin.\"\n\nShe appeared often in plays previously considered exclusive territory for white actresses: Same Time, Next Year, Agnes of God and Sunset Boulevard (as faded star Norma Desmond, the role played by Gloria Swanson in the 1950 film.)\n\nDiahann Carroll made history as the first African American in a lead role to win a Tony Award. Our thoughts go out to her friends and family. <a href=\"https://t.co/SvOqQm6kHz\">pic.twitter.com/SvOqQm6kHz</a> \u2014@TheWing\n\n\"I like to think that I opened doors for other women, although that wasn't my original intention,\" she said in 2002.\n\nHer film career was sporadic. She began with a secondary role in Carmen Jones in 1954 and five years later appeared in Porgy and Bess, although her singing voice was dubbed because it wasn't considered strong enough for the Gershwin opera. Her other films included Goodbye Again, Hurry Sundown, Paris Blues, and The Split.\n\nCarroll appears in a scene from the groundbreaking series Julia, which began in 1968.

She played a hard-bitten single mother of six who finds romance in Harlem with a garbage man played by James Earl Jones.\n\nCarroll says she got the role after the intended lead actress, Diana Sands, became sick and insisted her friend take the role (Sands died in 1973). But Carroll said those behind the movies did not see her in the role because of her work in Julia and made her audition without makeup.\n\n'I like to think that I opened doors for other women, although that wasn't my original intention,' Carroll, seen attending the 1987 Emmy Awards, said in a 2002 interview. (Douglas Pizac/Associated Press)\n\n\"Give me a chance. Just give me the opportunity to show you that I understand,\" she recalled telling them in an interview with the National Visionary Leadership Project.\n\n\"I'm an actress, singer, from New York City, from the streets of New York, and I pride myself on my work ... I would like to be given the opportunity to stretch my wings.\"\n\nShe would end up being nominated for her Oscar, and she recalled the filming a magical experience.\n\n\"I had such a good time, I almost told them you don't need to pay me,\" she added.\n\nDynasty cast members Carroll, John Forsythe, Linda Evans, second right, and Joan Collins celebrate the show at an event in Los Angeles in 1986. (Reed Saxon/Associated Press)\n\nIn the 1980s, she joined in the long-running prime-time soap opera Dynasty as Dominique Deveraux, the glamorous half-sister of Blake Carrington; her physical battles with Alexis Carrington, played by Joan Collins, were among fan highlights. Another memorable role was Marion Gilbert, as the haughty mother of Whitley Gilbert (played by Jasmine Guy) on the TV series A Different World.\n\n\"Diahann Carroll you taught us so much. We are stronger, more beautiful and risk takers because of you. We will forever sing your praises and speak your name.

In 2006, she made her first club appearance in New York in four decades, singing at Feinstein's at the Regency. Reviewing a return engagement in 2007, a New York Times critic wrote that she sang Both Sides Now with \"the reflective tone of a woman who has survived many severe storms and remembers every lightning flash and thunderclap.\"\n\nFrom fashion to the stage\n\nCarol Diann Johnson was born in New York City and attended the High School for the Performing Arts. Her father was a subway conductor and her mother a homemaker.\n\nShe recalls when she was around 3 or 4, her parents took her to North Carolina and left her in the care of her aunt there, without notice, for a year. She said it took a long time to forgive her parents, though she eventually did, and was there for them in their later years.\n\n\"It happened, it's over, it's done. A mature person finds a way to let go of that,\" she told OWN's Masterclass in an interview a few years ago.\n\n\"They did a lot of wonderful things. They lived, gave me everything they possibly could, and they passed on.\"\n\nTo Diahann Carroll, a Black woman who settled for nothing less than excellence, the complete recognition of her worth and the full valuation of her voice, may we all say \"thank you, and good night, Queen.\" \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc78\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/Lfu73VXsVf\">pic.twitter.com/Lfu73VXsVf</a> \u2014@JoyAnnReid\n\nShe began her career as a model in a segregated industry; she got much of her work due to publications like the black magazine Ebony. A prize from Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts TV show led to nightclub engagements.\n\nIn her 1998 memoir Diahann, Carroll traced her turbulent romantic life, which included liaisons with Harry Belafonte, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Sammy Davis Jr., Sidney Poitier and David Frost. She even became engaged to Frost, but the engagement was cancelled.\n\nAn early marriage to nightclub owner Monte Kay resulted in Carroll's only child, Suzanne, as well as a divorce. She also divorced her second husband, retail executive Freddie Glusman, later marrying magazine editor Robert DeLeon, who died.\n\nVic Damone, left, and Diahann Carroll show off their rings after their 1987 wedding in Atlantic City, N,J. (Scott Stetzer/Associated Press)\n\nHer most celebrated marriage was in 1987, to singer Vic Damone, and the two appeared together in nightclubs. But they separated in 1991 and divorced several years later.\n\nAfter she was treated for breast cancer in 1998, she spoke out for more money for research and for free screening for women who couldn't afford mammograms.\n\n\"We all look forward to the day that mastectomies, chemotherapy and radiation are considered barbaric,\" Carroll told a gathering in 2000.\n\nBesides her daughter, she is survived by grandchildren August and Sydney.", "description": "Diahann Carroll, the Oscar-nominated actress and singer who won critical acclaim as the first black woman to star in a non-servant role in a TV series, has died.
