He also cited a U.K. commitment to preserve an all Ireland approach to rules governing agricultural trade. Johnson said such measures would go \"a long way\" to getting a solution but conceded there were \"still other issues to resolve.\"\n\nHowever, Varadkar made clear the proposals did not go far enough to remove the need for the backstop, a legal fallback that would see the U.K. remain in a de-facto customs union with the EU.\n\n\u201cThe backstop continues to be a critical component of the Withdrawal Agreement unless and until alternatives are found,\" he said adding that such alternatives \u201cmust be realistic, legally binding and workable, and we have not received such proposals to date.\u201d\n\nPlaying to Johnson's well-known affection for the classics, Varadkar said that even if there was a deal the U.K. faced a \"Herculean task\" negotiating free trade agreements with the EU and the U.S. simultaneously, but pledged that Ireland would be its \"ally, your Athena\" in doing so if Brexit went smoothly.\n\nJohnson faced tough questioning, with one reporter asking whether his comment last week that he would rather be \"dead in a ditch\" than delay Brexit suggested that he did not understand the high stakes in Ireland and Northern Ireland, where fears that Brexit could foster a continued rise in political violence are widespread.\n\n\u201cEverybody in the U.K. and in Ireland understands the fantastic political importance and sensitivity of the border,\" he said and repeated his unilateral pledge not to introduce any checks on the U.K. side of the border.\n\nJohnson insisted that he was still determined to get a deal and that for Brexit to take place without an agreement \u201c\u201cwould be a failure of state craft for which we would all be responsible.\u201d\n\nOn talks to restore the power-sharing devolved government in Northern Ireland, Varadkar said that Dublin would oppose any imposition of direct rule from Westminster but that were such a course of action to be taken, would seek a \"consultative role in any big decisions taken in Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nA decision to impose direct rule may be needed soon, U.K. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith suggested last week, to ensure that Northern Ireland has political direction and decision-making to allow it to manage the likely disruption that would result from Brexit should the U.K. leave on its planned date of October 31.", "description": "Dublin cannot \u2018agree to the replacement of a legal guarantee with a promise\u2019 said Irish prime minister.", "authors": ["Charlie Cooper", "Cristina Gallardo"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1166915862-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
