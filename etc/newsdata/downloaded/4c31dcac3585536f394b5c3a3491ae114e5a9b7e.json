It also underscores the hurdles Democrats will face as they attempt to claw information from the White House over Trump's efforts to convince Ukrainian leaders to provide dirt on Joe Biden and his son.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/76/1d/89d23a804d4d95f3083b6e9593d4/trumpimpeachment.jpg\"\n\nPompeo also suggested that State officials identified as key players in the Ukraine affair would be unable to comply with a schedule of depositions set to begin Wednesday.\n\n\u201cBased on the profound procedural and legal deficiencies noted above, the committee's requested dates for depositions are not feasible,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn response, the chairs of the three committees handling the investigation accused Pompeo of trying to protect himself and the president from congressional scrutiny.\n\n\u201cAny effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress \u2014including State Department employees \u2014 is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry,\u201d said Engel, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings in a joint statement.\n\n\u201cIn response, Congress may infer from this obstruction that any withheld documents and testimony would reveal information that corroborates the whistleblower complaint,\u201d lawmakers continued, referencing the allegations that were referred to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general in August.\n\nHouse Democrats formally subpoenaed Pompeo last Friday \u2014 the first subpoena since Speaker Nancy Pelosi formalized an impeachment inquiry \u2014 and summoned a slew of current and former State Department officials for closed-door depositions.\n\nDespite Pompeo's comments, Kurt Volker, who resigned last week as U.S. special envoy for Ukraine negotiations, will appear as scheduled on Thursday, according to a committee official.\n\nMarie Yovanovitch \u2014 the ousted U.S. ambassador to Ukraine whom Trump criticized in his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 will appear on Oct. 11, the official added. She was initially scheduled to appear on Wednesday.\n\nSeparately, a congressional aide confirmed later Tuesday that the State Department\u2019s inspector general made an \u201curgent request\u201d to brief Capitol Hill staffers on Ukraine-related issues Wednesday.\n\n\n\nVolker resigned his position last Friday, one day after he was named in the whistleblower complaint that set off the firestorm over Trump's pressure campaign to Ukrainian leaders. Volker is said to have had helped set up meetings between Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Ukrainian officials.\n\n\n\nHouse Democrats served Giuliani with a subpoena on Monday \u2014 the second in four days as Democrats power ahead with their investigation into Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\nDemocratic investigators are demanding details from Giuliani about his alleged role as an intermediary between the American and Ukrainian governments, including his trips to Madrid, Paris and Warsaw this year to push for a Biden probe on behalf of Trump.\n\nGiuliani has acknowledged that he asked the Ukrainian government to probe Biden and his son Hunter, and has been asked to produce \u201ctext messages, phone records, and other communications\u201d that could reveal the involvement of senior Trump administration officials.\n\n\n\nDemocratic leaders have warned that refusing to comply would amount to obstruction of Congress \u2014 a charge that could be ultimately included in articles of impeachment.\n\nPompeo rejected that argument, writing in his letter, \u201cthere is no legal basis for that threat.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats have zeroed in on Trump's Ukraine controversy as they deepen their impeachment inquiry, putting aside for now a slew of other ongoing investigations into the president, including possible obstruction of justice outlined in special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nMuch of the work this week is being led by the House Intelligence Committee, which plans to return to Washington on Friday for a hearing while the full House remains on recess until Oct. 15. The Intelligence panel will be briefed behind closed doors by the Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who first alerted Congress to the anonymous whistleblower complaint.\n\nTop Democrats have also worked to shore up their own messaging as they battle with the White House over impeachment, with Pelosi and her deputies urging their caucus to focus on what they see as presidential abuse of power when laying out the House's argument for an impeachment inquiry.\n\nNahal Toosi contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ef/f4/35a1a0c9492dbe9b46cacc7cf712/191001-mike-pompeo-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
