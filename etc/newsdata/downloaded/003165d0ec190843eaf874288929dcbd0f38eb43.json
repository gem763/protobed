Mike Thompson, Detroit Free Press\n\nThe comics skewer Trump's speech about the raid that killed ISIS leader al-Baghdadi in Best of Late Night\n\nThe bone spurs that prevented President Donald Trump from serving in the military certainly didn\u2019t stop him from taking credit for one of the most daring military operations in recent memory: The killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a special operations raid last weekend.\n\nAnd as you might suspect, the late-night comedians had something to say about such a display of bravado from a reported Vietnam draft dodger.\n\nJimmy Kimmel starts us off with a creative mashup video comparing Trump's speech announcing the death of the terrorist leader to former President Barack Obama's 2011 speech following a raid that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Trevor Noah ties Trump's response over the destruction of a wall during the raid to his immigration dreams, and Stephen Colbert wonders if Trump really ought to share the less-than-appetizing details of al-Baghdadi's death.\n\n\"Daily Show\" host Trevor Noah attends the TIME 100 Gala on April 23, 2019 in New York City.
