The jury rejected the defendant's insanity defense during the trial.\n\nThe younger Gilbert was reliant on his parents for basic daily expenses and had been unable to hold down a job, prosecutors said.\n\nHe received a weekly $1,000 allowance from his parents \u2014 which the defendant spent on travel and other personal expenses. That allowance had been cut prior to the killing.\n\nGilbert Sr. reduced his son's allowance to $300 hours before the shooting, prosecutors said, according to a CNN report. Gilbert Sr. was the founder and manager of the New York-based Wainscott Capital Partners Fund.\n\nIn a victim impact statement, the victim's wife, Shelley Gilbert, asked for Gilbert Jr. \"to be given as light a sentence as possible,\"according to CNN. She said the family had been seeking medical help for the defendant for years because \"he's too sick to be able to judge.\"\n\nThe jury found that Gilbert Jr., who was also convicted on charges of criminal possession of a weapon, murdered his father with a shot to the head at close range. The weapon, a semi-automatic pistol, was purchased months earlier from an Ohio seller.\n\nThe defendant put the gun in his father's hand in an attempt to stage the death as a suicide, according to trial testimony.\n\n\"Thomas Gilbert Sr. was a beloved member of his family and business community when his own son murdered him in a cold-blooded killing,\" District Attorney Cyrus Vance said Friday in a statement. \"But now, thanks to my office's prosecutors, the defendant has finally been held accountable and he will serve a life sentence for this unconscionable crime.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Thomas Gilbert Jr. sentenced in dad's shooting after allowance dispute", "description": "Thomas Gilbert Jr. was convicted three months ago of shooting his father, Thomas Gilbert Sr., a wealthy hedge fund manager.", "authors": ["Joel Shannon", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aiHqP5TqeHIgAclF1uEUvA--~B/aD0xNjAwO3c9MTI3NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/ea497a316ed21f925914ebeb84645b57", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
