Then, unlike now, not a single lawmaker had been alive the last time Congress impeached a president. They had little understanding of how to try and remove Richard Nixon from the White House. So they tapped Clinton and a team of ambitious staffers to dive into the history of impeachment, stretching back to the 14th century in England: How has impeachment been used? What were the justifications? Can we apply it to Nixon?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe resulting document became a centerpiece of the congressional push to drive the Republican president from office. But then Nixon resigned. The memo was buried.\n\nThat was just the report\u2019s first life.\n\nIn an ironic twist, the document was resurrected in the late 1990s. Republicans gleefully used it to bolster their unsuccessful bid to oust Clinton\u2019s now-husband, President Bill Clinton. Then it faded from public conscience \u2014 again.\n\nUntil now, that is. The 45-year-old report has become a handbook House Democratic lawmakers and aides say they are using to help determine whether they have the goods to mount a full-scale impeachment effort against President Donald Trump, the same man who three years ago upended Hillary Clinton\u2019s bid for a return trip to the White House.\n\nEssentially, Clinton, albeit indirectly, might get one last shot at accomplishing what she couldn\u2019t in 2016 \u2014 defeating Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI can only say that the impeachment Gods have a great sense of humor,\u201d Alan Baron, an expert on the topic who has staffed four congressional impeachments against federal judges, said of the recurring role Hillary Clinton keeps playing in this story.\n\nIt started in early 1974.\n\nThe walls were closing in on a beleaguered Richard Nixon. His aides were going down one by one. He had tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to halt the investigations into his behavior by cleaning house during the infamous \u201cSaturday Night Massacre.\u201d\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Hillary Rodham, a 26-year-old law school graduate, was hired by the House Judiciary Committee to work on a bipartisan staff effort to help determine whether to impeach Nixon. She joined a team of aspiring lawyers that also included Bill Weld, who would go on to his own illustrious career as a top Justice Department prosecutor, Massachusetts governor and most recently as a longshot 2020 GOP primary challenger against Trump.\n\nOver a couple of months just before the climactic end of the Watergate scandal, the team dug deep into constitutional and legal arcana scouring documents that dated to the country\u2019s founding, as well as century-old newspaper clippings in the Library of Congress.\n\nThe resulting title of the report, \u201cConstitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment,\u201d may elicit yawns. But what they produced became a seminal 64-page roadmap with appendices that looks into what counts as an impeachable offense.\n\nAt the time, lawmakers needed the guidance. They had not had to think seriously about these issues for more than 100 years, when Congress rebelled against President Andrew Johnson over his handling of reconstruction after the Civil War.\n\nThe staffers\u2019 research broke ground by making an accessible argument that a president doesn\u2019t have to commit a straight-up crime for Congress to consider the historic step of impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe framers did not write a fixed standard. Instead they adopted from English history a standard sufficiently general and flexible to meet future circumstances and events, the nature and character of which they could not foresee,\u201d the House staffers, including the future first lady, wrote about the ill-defined constitutional working of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nJohn Doar (right), the House Judiciary Committee's chief counsel, sits with Chiarman Peter Rodino in the midst of the impeachment inquiry into Richard Nixon in 1974. | Charles P. Gorry/AP Photo\n\nTheir exhaustive report also included a whirlwind history lesson about how America\u2019s founders had been well-versed in impeachment when they included the language in several clauses of the Constitution \u2014 the British Parliament had used the impeachment process as a check on royalty for more than 400 years, dating to the 14th century.\n\nAnd the process hadn\u2019t just been used to remove alleged criminals from office. In the United States, 83 articles of impeachment had been voted out of the House up to that point against a dozen federal judges, one senator and Andrew Johnson, and fewer than a third actually involved specific criminal acts. Far more common, they wrote, was that the House was dealing with allegations that someone had violated their duties, oath of office or seriously undermined public confidence in their ability to perform their official functions.\n\n\u201cBecause impeachment of a President is a grave step for the nation, it is to be predicated only upon conduct seriously incompatible with either the constitutional form and principles of our government or the proper performance of constitutional duties of the presidential office,\u201d the House staffers concluded.\n\nWhile the document Hillary Rodham and her colleagues produced got marked as a staff report, the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee still used it to justify their historic votes against Nixon. In fact, two of the three articles of impeachment adopted by the powerful panel \u2014 dealing with the Republican president\u2019s abuse of power and contempt of Congress \u2014 didn\u2019t cover areas that fall neatly into the category of federal crimes. A final staff report submitted to the House just days after Nixon made history as the first president to resign from office quoted from the staff\u2019s earlier analysis.\n\nMore than two decades later, though, Clinton may have wished she had never helped write the document.\n\nIt was 1997, eight months before the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke into the news. President Bill Clinton was facing Republican outrage over everything from allegations of campaign finance irregularities to Whitewater, the probe into the Clinton\u2019s Arkansas real estate investments. To legitimize their anger, some Republicans turned to a document that likely hadn\u2019t been discussed for a generation \u2014 the 1974 impeachment report Hillary Clinton had worked on.\n\nGeorgia GOP Rep. Bob Barr resurfaced the report in a sarcasm-laced op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that opened with the line \u201cDear Mrs. Clinton.\u201d\n\nThe conservative congressman went on to thank the first lady for giving lawmakers a \u201croad map\u201d to consider her husband\u2019s impeachment with a report that \u201cappears objective, fair, well researched and consistent with other materials reflecting and commenting on impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it is every bit as relevant today as it was 23 years ago,\u201d he added.\n\nIn time, both parties would cite from the Judiciary Committee\u2019s 1974 staff report as they fought over whether the conduct associated with President Clinton\u2019s sexual relationship with Lewinsky merited impeachment.\n\nCalling the Watergate document \u201chistoric,\u201d then-Virginia GOP Rep. Bob Goodlatte argued in the fall of 1998 that Clinton\u2019s offenses, like those of Nixon, had extended beyond questions of obstruction of justice to whether the president betrayed the public trust. Then-Rep. Charles Canady, a Florida Republican chairing a House subcommittee on the Constitution, referred repeatedly to the Watergate panel\u2019s work during the House debate and later in Clinton\u2019s Senate trial, which ultimately concluded with his acquittal.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, had a different read on the group\u2019s findings.\n\nNew Window INTERACTIVE: See which House lawmakers support impeachment.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Zoe Lofgren, who had worked for a member of the Judiciary Committee during Watergate, shared copies of the more than 20-year old report with colleagues from both parties and posted a link to it online \u2014 she had an offer from law school students to type it out so it could be searchable by word but internal ethics rules prevented that move. Her primary argument was that Clinton\u2019s lies about his relationship with Lewinsky, while immoral, didn\u2019t match the historical precedents outlined as qualifying for impeachment in the 1974 staff analysis.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing is they cited it for purposes it didn\u2019t support. I wonder whether they read it or whether they had index cards prepared by their staff,\u201d Lofgren said in a recent interview when asked about the Republicans who were using the report to justify removing Clinton from office.\n\nTed Kalo, a former top Democratic aide on the Judiciary panel, said there was widespread bipartisan agreement that the Watergate staff report mattered \u2014 even amid the differing interpretations.\n\n\u201cGreat books have been written and eloquent testimony was given in the 1998 hearing on the topic, but even in 1998, the 1974 staff report was considered to be state of the art,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most concise, easily understood document on the history of the impeachment clause and the intent of the framers, including the issue of what constitutes an impeachable offense that I\u2019ve come across. And it faithfully and logically describes what was intended to be the appropriate scope of the House\u2019s impeachment power,\u201d he added.\n\nNow it\u2019s 2019. President Donald Trump is an unindicted criminal co-conspirator who has fended off myriad congressional probes and watched his aides go to prison over an investigation into the Trump campaign. Most Democrats \u2014 not to mention their fervent progressive base \u2014 are clamoring for impeachment. And yet again, the 1974 impeachment report is getting a rereading on Capitol Hill.\n\nJust as the Watergate staff suggested, the current House Democrat-led impeachment inquiry has grown beyond the criminal allegations that special counsel Robert Mueller investigated \u2014 conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and obstruction of justice \u2014 into to a wider list of grievances, covering everything from campaign finance violations, to self-dealing, abuse of power and undermining the judiciary and media.\n\nSenior members have dusted the document off for their newer colleagues. Lofgren, for one, asked her staff to post a fresh link to the Watergate document back in mid-May 2017, not long after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey and Mueller\u2019s appointment.\n\n\u201cI just thought, as people were throwing suggestions around, it\u2019s a very tightly crafted and I think excellent piece of scholarship and it\u2019d be helpful to have that be available to the public,\u201d Lofgren said.\n\nOthers have pointed back to the 1974 document as reason for Democrats to move faster.\n\nMichael Conway, a former Judiciary Committee staffer in 1974 and longtime friend of both Bill and Hillary Clinton, cited the report in an op-ed for NBC published in March that took issue with House Democratic leadership\u2019s reluctance to embrace impeachment proceedings against Trump.\n\nHe slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for a \u201ccramped formulation\u201d that impeachment can only proceed if investigative developments emerge that are \u201coverwhelming, compelling and bipartisan.\u201d That didn\u2019t square with what the 1974 researchers showed, he wrote.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/2063/1155968404_6085709065001_6085703631001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\n\u201cThe myths about impeachment they skewered then remain relevant to Democrats considering any exercise of that power today,\u201d Conway said.\n\nMichael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor who has written books on impeachment and testified before Congress on the topic, said the Watergate committee report \u201chas easily withstood the test of time\u201d into 2019.\n\n\u201cIt still is as good as any other document yet prepared on the origins and scope of the federal impeachment process. It is appropriately authoritative. And so it is as relevant to President Trump as it has been to every other president since Nixon,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Gerhardt said Republicans who embraced the report during Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment should for consistency sake be open to what it tells them now in Trump\u2019s case, he said he also recognized there are new political limitations. For starters, Democrats and Republican aides wrote the Watergate report together.\n\n\u201cIt seems impossible that a joint staff would be conceivable on a hugely important matter,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIt shows how far we have come (down) since 1974.\u201d", "description": "A congressional report Clinton helped pen during Watergate was later used to justify impeaching her husband.
