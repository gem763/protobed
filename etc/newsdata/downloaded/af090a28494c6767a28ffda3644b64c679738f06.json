Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said he would consider supporting impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump if he were provided with proof that a crime had taken place.\n\n\u201cSure. I mean \u2026 show me something that \u2026 is a crime,\u201d Graham said in an interview with Axios on HBO last week. \u201cIf you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing.\u201d\n\nAxios reported about Graham\u2019s role in the impeachment of President Bill Clinton and what could be an upcoming test of his loyalty to Trump: \u201cGraham was a fiery House prosecutor during the 1998 impeachment trial of President Clinton. Now that Graham is in the Senate, he\u2019ll vote to acquit \u2014 or remove \u2014 Trump if he\u2019s impeached by the House.\u201d\n\nBut Graham said that the phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky does not meet the \u201ccrime\u201d criteria.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read the transcript of the Ukrainian phone call,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a quid pro quo to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cKevin Bishop [a Graham staffer], said Friday that Graham still has not heard or seen anything that he deems impeachable,\u201d Axios reported. \u201cGraham said he\u2019s changed his view of Trump\u2019s character since opposing him during the 2016 primaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to know him, and I find him to be a handful,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI find him to be an equal opportunity abuser of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, he can be very charming and be very gracious, and I\u2019m judging him by his conduct,\u201d Graham said, adding that while he opposes U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria, he likes Trump\u2019s domestic policies.\n\n\u201cSo you play the ball as it lies,\u201d Graham said.\n\nGraham has been a reliable ally of Trump, including during the contentious confirmation hearings of now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.", "description": "Sen.
