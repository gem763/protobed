On her appointment, she chose a coat of arms with the Latin motto \u201cOmnia Feminae Aequissimae\u201d: \u201cWomen are equal to everything.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, she was voted No. 4 in a list of Britain\u2019s most powerful women by BBC Radio 4\u2019s \u201cWoman\u2019s Hour.\u201d She is one of the most visible members of the 12-member Supreme Court \u2014 including on the court\u2019s Instagram page. In the September article in British Vogue, she was called \u201ca heroine for our times.\u201d\n\nKnown as an advocate of diversity, she said this year during a speech to commemorate the centenary of women\u2019s entry into the legal profession that more of Britain\u2019s judiciary should be women. Just 29 percent of court judges in the country are women, according to the Ministry of Justice.\n\n\u201cWe should be half of judges at least,\u201d Lady Hale said. She has denied, however, claims that she is a \u201cjudicial activist.\u201d\n\nShe has also been vocal about the wigs that many advocates are required to wear in court. \u201cI have this specific objection that everyone has to wear these men\u2019s wigs,\u201d she said in an interview with Prospect Magazine. \u201cI had a fantasy once that on my last day of having to wear a wig in court I would go and hire a madame de pompadour women\u2019s wig and powder that up.\u201d\n\nMore recently, she criticized the fact that when she had been the only woman on the Supreme Court, all her fellow judges at the Supreme Court belonged to an all-male private member\u2019s club. She said she found it unacceptable for them to have a professional space to socialize and interact that excluded her and other women.", "description": "The 74-year-old has carved out a long, trailblazing career as an academic, legal reformer and feminist \u2014 and she loves striking brooches.", "authors": ["Yonette Joseph", "Ceylan Yeginsu"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/world/24brexit-hale/24brexit-hale-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
