Earlier, Erdogan said 500 militants had been killed, 26 surrendered and 24 were wounded so far.\n\nMr Raab called on Turkey to \"exercise maximum restraint and to bring an end to this unilateral military action\".\n\nHe added: \"This is not the action we expected from an ally. It is reckless, it is counter-productive and it plays straight into the hands of Russia and indeed the Assad regime.\"\n\nThe Syrian army deployment is a victory for President Bashar al-Assad and his most powerful ally, Russia.\n\nIt gives the Syrian-Russian alliance a foothold in the biggest remaining swath of the country that had been beyond their grasp.\n\nShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said: \"The situation in northern Syria has gone from bad to worse, to utterly catastrophic and horrifying since the Trump administration withdrew its troops and gave a green light to Turkey to invade.\"\n\nMs Thornberry told the Commons Turkish airstrikes and artillery barrages, as well as \"barbaric jihadi death squads\", have led to the deaths of dozens of civilians.\n\nTory MP and former defence minister Tobias Ellwood warned: \"Direct conflict between Syria and Turkey is now just another notch closer.\"\n\nHe said: \"In just a week we've seen the map of north-east Syria redrawn following the ill thought through foreign policy change by President Trump which has triggered a tragic series of events now undermining international efforts to contain Daesh.\n\n\"What discussions has he (Mr Raab) had with his US counterparts to invite them to re-engage with the international community on the future of Syria? They cannot back out of their international responsibilities.\n\n\"We speak of the erosion of the rules-based order. Does this not send a worrying message to Russia, given its resurgent activities in eastern Europe, and China with its claim over much of the South China Sea, if the West does not have the resolve to defend international standards when they are breached by a Nato ally.\"\n\nInternational Trade Secretary Liz Truss said: \u201cWe continue to monitor the situation in Syria very closely and are considering the licensing position in the light of recent developments.\n\n\u201cNo further export licences to Turkey for items which might be used in military operations in Syria will be granted while we do so.\n\n\u201cMy Department will take into account any developments in the operations in Syria as part of our rigorous licensing process.\u201d\n\nShe added: \"The UK has, for some time, been carefully considering export licence applications for Turkey in light of Turkish activities in Syria.\u201d", "description": "No new arms export licences will be granted amid a review of violence on the border with Syria - yet millions of pounds worth of existing licences are still in force", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20572847.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_TURKEY-SYRIA-KURDS-CONFILCT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
