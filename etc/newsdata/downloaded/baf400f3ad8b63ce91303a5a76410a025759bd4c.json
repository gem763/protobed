Instead, they were released after posting bail or at the end of their sentences, forcing ICE agents to track them down.\n\n\u201cYou may be the first we\u2019re calling out, but you won\u2019t be the last,\u201d Albence warned sanctuary cities. \u201cThis needs to stop. Work with us. Find a way that we can jointly prevent murderers, pedophiles, rapists, drug dealers and domestic abusers from being released back into our communities. It\u2019s plain and simple.\u201d\n\nAlbence was flanked by sheriffs from Texas, North Dakota and other states where Trump enjoys broad support, appearing in the White House briefing room as a congressional hearing was underway across town examining a whistleblower complaint that has spawned an impeachment inquiry. Some of Trump\u2019s critics argued Thursday that the renewed attack on sanctuary cities was meant as a diversion designed to energize his political base.\n\nFixating on immigration \u2014 and the specter of danger \u2014 is a recurring theme for Trump. During his presidential campaign he called Mexicans \u201crapists\u201d and said they \u201cbring crime,\u201d and he warned of an \u201cinvasion\u201d at the border before the midterm elections, when Democrats regained control of the House of Representatives. He also appeared in the Rose Garden with \u201cangel moms,\u201d whose children were killed by immigrants in the United States illegally, after declaring a national emergency at the border.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Trump administration also proposed having ICE release immigrant detainees in sanctuary cities as a way to target political foes \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s district in San Francisco among them \u2014 something that Trump said in April was under \u201cstrong consideration.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for immigrants slammed the White House and ICE for publicizing what they called misleading information about immigrants and said studies by the Marshall Project and others show no link between illegal immigration and crime.\n\nAli Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a nonpartisan immigrant advocacy organization, pointed out that Thursday\u2019s announcement coincided with an annual event in Washington, sponsored by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, that promotes increased immigration enforcement and supports Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEvery year, anti-immigrant forces work very hard to politicize immigration. This year is unique in that the politics of immigration are ripe to be exploited by the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, the politicization of immigration enforcement really does nothing to keep us any safer. The data shows over and over again that immigrant communities are safe.\u201d\n\nAlbence, a career immigration official, rejected claims that the news conference was politically motivated and said it was long planned to promote public safety. While most local and state governments allow ICE to make arrests inside their prisons and jails, he said hundreds of others are releasing serious criminals after they post bail or finish their sentences instead of holding them so that immigration agents can pick them up and work to deport them.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a political matter, it\u2019s a public safety matter,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s past time to put aside all the political rhetoric and listen to the facts. And the fact is: People are being hurt and victimized every day because of jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with ICE.\u201d\n\nCalifornia, New York, Illinois and other states have severely limited cooperation with ICE, while individual counties and cities also have refused to help. Some local officials say they fear discouraging immigrants from reporting crimes, while others say they lack legal authority to hold people for immigration enforcement.\n\nAlbence said ICE expects to post a \u201cdouble digit\u201d drop in criminal arrests this fiscal year, but did not provide details. He said ICE deported more than 145,000 criminals last year, including nearly 10,000 suspected gang members. As of last week, ICE was detaining more than 50,000 migrants a day, on average, a 50 percent increase from the Obama era. As of Saturday, 35 percent of the detainees in ICE facilities had been arrested by the agency, while the majority were migrants who Customs and Border Protection agents had taken into custody at the border after recent crossings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nICE detains and deports immigrants for the Department of Homeland Security, and most of its arrests are carried out in the interior of the United States, typically at jails and prisons and mostly targeting criminals.\n\nSanctuary cities exploded under the Obama administration as ICE ramped up enforcement and deported thousands of immigrants with a history of minor offenses or no criminal records at all.\n\nAlbence said the agency is primarily targeting immigrants who have committed crimes and are eligible for deportation under federal law.\n\nAD", "description": "Acting ICE director says criminal arrests are down this fiscal year in part because jurisdictions won\u2019t cooperate with immigration enforcement, but he did not provide details.", "authors": ["Maria Sacchetti", "Reporter Covering Immigrant Communities", "Immigration", "Customs Enforcement"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jCgH6wusELMCNP629ZnBm6KvBqk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/R2LCSXXAPAI6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
