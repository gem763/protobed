This side of the family was listed as \"perished\" in the Holocaust at Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s official memorial to the Holocaust\u2019s victims.\n\nElbaz had been working on her family\u2019s genealogy and placed an ad on JewishGen, which caught the attention of her now-found cousin Gemma Brown in England.\n\nThey connected as soon as possible.\n\nAs it turns out, Ofer had also submitted a DNA test years ago, which matched with the DNA of Brown and her mother, Alison O\u2019Callaghan -- Mairowitz's daughter.\n\n\"It all fell into place,\" Ofer told \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nElbaz sent Ofer pictures of Mairowitz and Ofer knew instantly that he was family.\n\n\"I immediately recognized him because he looks exactly like my dad,\" Ofer said.\n\nOnce they were connected, Ofer and O\u2019Callaghan jumped on FaceTime in what was an emotional phone call. Both confessed that they had been searching for each other.\n\n\"We cried and cried and cried and cried. We couldn\u2019t get one word out,\" Ofer said.\n\nUpon hearing that Mairowitz and his family were found, Sana was in complete shock.\n\nCourtesy Leetal Ofer\n\n\"He said, 'It couldn\u2019t be. They\u2019re listed as perished in the Holocaust!'\" Ofer said.\n\nOfer and her family were headed to Israel for a family wedding and learned that O\u2019Callaghan and her father were also going to be in Israel. The families decided it was finally time to be reunited all these years later and changed their tickets to match each other\u2019s dates.\n\nIn a now viral video, Sana walks in and embraces Mairowitz after 75 years. Ofer said the entire family cried many tears of happiness.\n\nSana said he last remembered seeing Mairowitz in Romania in either 1943 or 1944 while the war was still going on.\n\nAt that point in time, Sana\u2019s brothers were already killed by Nazis. Ofer said she thinks her father survived because he was a blonde, blue-eyed boy with \"Aryan\" features.\n\nSana escaped with his sister and mother, fleeing for close to two years.\n\nCourtesy Leetal Ofer\n\nOfer said her father would say that he, his mother and sister would often sleep in between dead bodies in the day so as not to get caught. The trio mostly traveled at night.\n\n\"You have to understand these are little kids, you know? Hungry, hungry little kids, escaping and living in fear,\" she said.\n\nThey finally arrived to a refugee camp in Italy where they stayed for six months. Family members from her grandfather\u2019s side later smuggled them into Paris. After staying in Paris for a few years, they shifted to Israel.\n\nAccording to Ofer, Mairowitz escaped with his sister, Betty, with the help of an English colonel. Upon arriving into England, Mairowitz was placed into foster care.\n\nWhile Sana grew up Jewish, Mairowitz grew up Catholic.\n\nAt the time of their escapes, Sana was 11 or 12 and Mairowitz was 10. Sana is now 87 and Mairowitz is 85.\n\nTo commemorate their reunion in Israel, both families drove to Yad Vashem to change their records in the archives.\n\n\"We changed their status from perished to survivor,\" Ofer said.\n\nA lifelong search finally ended in a happy reunion.", "description": "Cousins Morris Sana and Simon Mairowitz lost each other while fleeing from the Nazis in World War II. 75 years later, they finally came together in an emotional reunion.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/reunited-926-ht-ps-191002_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
