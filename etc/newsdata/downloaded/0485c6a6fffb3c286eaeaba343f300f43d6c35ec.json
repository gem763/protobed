It's dangerous\u2019: Graham Norton and Alan Carr on desire, camp and \u2018cancel culture\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "How do you think you would do if you were contestants on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race?\n\nGraham Norton: Poorly.\n\nAlan Carr: Before I started dressing up as women in sketches, I thought: \u201cI bet because I\u2019m not a looker as a man, I\u2019m one of those ones that, when you put on the make up, I am quite something \u2013 quite stunning.\u201d And no. It just doesn\u2019t translate.\n\nI\u2019ve seen the first episode of your show and it is a lot more messy and anarchic than the US version.\n\nAlan: Drag queens in the UK, they survive it all \u2013 there\u2019s a hen party, a stag party, people throwing beer bottles. They work not on their heels, but on their wits.\n\nGraham: Even the ones that aren\u2019t funny are funny. Suddenly, you realise how unfunny some of the American ones are.\n\nDo you think the UK version might get lost in translation?\n\nGraham: Funny is funny, I think.\n\nAlan: I sort of hope it does get a little bit lost. I had to go in and tell RuPaul who Kim Woodburn [the TV personality and cleaner] is. How can you explain to Americans who Kim Woodburn is? It\u2019s just nice, for once in my life, to not be the campest one in the room.\n\nDo you ever find that you check yourselves in public any more \u2013 that you worry about people recognising that you\u2019re gay?\n\nAlan: I give up with all that. I give up.\n\nGraham: But I understand it. I mean, sometimes you do, because if you feel like someone\u2019s gonna punch you, then yes, you do. Still, now, you know. It\u2019s funny when people talk about coming out, because you want to say to them: it never ends. You think you come out and that\u2019s the end of it. No. Because then it\u2019s the first nice day of the year and the cab driver says something about \u201cOh, I love the summer, you know, they\u2019ve all got their tits out,\u201d and you\u2019re like: is this a moment? Is this worth my time? Do I reveal myself?\n\nDo you still encounter a loathing of camp among some \u201cstraight-acting\u201d gay men?\n\nGraham: I think you do in that, still, straight acting is an ideal. And that\u2019s just part of our sexuality. We\u2019re all prone to that. I remember seeing a BBC Three thing about young gays down in Brighton, and my name came up, and the idea of being me was just horrific to them. And it broke my heart, because they were me. I just thought: \u201cBut you are little mes, you are the fey, camp ones.\u201d\n\nAlan: I say to Graham, do you remember when we used to get slagged off by the snooty gays, you know: \u201cOh, camp \u2013 is that really how gay men should be portrayed?\u2019 I mean, look at what\u2019s come since, love. We\u2019re like Vin Diesel and Sylvester Stallone, compared with that. Camp is different things to different people. Did you ever watch Dynasty? What about when the son came out as gay and had a fight? That, to me, was the stirring.\n\nGraham: No, my stirring was Alain Delon in The Yellow Rolls-Royce. He took his shirt off. And I remember trying to discuss with a boy at school how lovely his back was.\n\nHow did he respond?\n\nGraham: \u201cWell, it was a nice car!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest\n\nBring it on \u2026 Alan Carr, Michelle Visage, Graham Norton, judges of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK season one, with contestants. Photograph: James Spawforth/BBC\n\nYou\u2019re both known as chat show hosts. Who have been your worst and best guests?\n\nAlan: I\u2019m not going down that road. I mean, booking for a chat show is \u2013 when you are on Channel 4 and you\u2019re not Graham Norton \u2013 it is pulling teeth. [Turns to Graham] One time you had David Beckham on, just as an amuse-bouche. He just came out for 10 minutes and then went away! And I\u2019m like: \u201cOh no, which reality star am I talking to today?\u201d\n\nGraham: But at Channel 4 when we started we had exactly the same thing. For that audience you have to push things further and it\u2019s ruder and I think publicists get really nervous. So actually on BBC One where it\u2019s nice, everything\u2019s lovely, it\u2019s much easier to welcome people on.\n\nAlan: Towards the end of Chatty Man I just found that they wanted more vitriol. Then the monologue at the end was becoming a nightmare. I mean, you would go to a function and you would be like: \u201cOh my God, Simon Cowell is coming along in his built-up shoes.\u201d You can\u2019t keep pushing the envelope, because socially you become a pariah. And the people you slag off in the monologues, when you meet them, they\u2019re actually quite lovely. And it\u2019s the people you like who are the complete arseholes.\n\nDo you think comedians should be worried about cancel culture [where someone is called out or boycotted online]?\n\nAlan: It\u2019s a nightmare. I just feel that if standup comedy disappears, where do you go ... I don\u2019t know. Let me have a think about this. It does wind me up.\n\nGraham: I\u2019m in two minds about it. On the one hand, I think it\u2019s annoying that you\u2019re being told what to say \u2026 But funny continues \u2013 you just have to be slightly cleverer about what you\u2019re funny about. When alternative comedy began, it was saying, OK, Bernard Manning\u2019s act: that doesn\u2019t exist any more. And I think we have started to drift back to Bernard Manning. People are using really lazy targets in a kind of \u201clook at us, we can say anything\u201d way. I think there\u2019s nothing fearless about soft targets. It\u2019s actually the opposite of fearless. You\u2019re picking on people who don\u2019t have a defence, who don\u2019t have a voice.\n\nGraham, do you ever miss the camp smuttiness of your old Channel 4 show, So Graham Norton?\n\nGraham: I don\u2019t. Because [that kind of thing is] still on the telly, if you want that. It\u2019s there. But happily, it\u2019s not being presented by a 56-year-old man. Because I think that it was already getting quite dodgy by the time I stopped doing it, in my 40s. And it just becomes unseemly.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018You\u2019ve already broken so many rules just to get on stage. It gives you a freedom and there\u2019s something dangerous about drag still, and I enjoy that\u2019 \u2026 Alan Carr and Graham Norton. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nWhat do you mean by dodgy?\n\nGraham: I think it\u2019s unseemly for someone of a certain age to be doing all of that. I still find it funny, but not as funny as I did. Things shock me now that wouldn\u2019t have shocked me when I was 25. I\u2019m a bit like [sharp intake of breath] he said \u201ccunt\u201d \u2013 twice! Maybe I have become more sensitive.\n\nI always think it\u2019s weird when people talk about jokes and what you can do, or \u201cyou can\u2019t say anything now\u201d. And it\u2019s like, the only people stopping you are your audience. They decide what\u2019s funny and what\u2019s not funny. There isn\u2019t some weird comedy police. If I came out in front of my audience on a Thursday night and did some of those jokes we did [on So Graham Norton], the audience would just look ashen. And they wouldn\u2019t like it. It is partly, I think, because of Twitter and things now, where there\u2019s so much bile and viciousness out there that people don\u2019t want that in their entertainment.\n\nDid you see the online backlash against drag queen Baga Chipz when she was announced as a contestant on UK Drag Race? It was because of an old article in which she said it was OK for gay people to vote Tory in the 2017 general election.\n\nAlan: Well, that\u2019s her opinion, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s an opinion. It\u2019s dangerous when you start telling people they can\u2019t have an opinion on something. And, you know, you don\u2019t cancel someone, you engage with someone. That\u2019s the problem. I think that\u2019s why I was struggling with the cancelling thing. Because it doesn\u2019t actually cancel \u2013 if anything it gives people more column inches. Doesn\u2019t anyone make any mistakes any more?\n\nGraham: Apparently, they do.\n\nAlan: It sounds like I work at Hallmark, but every day is a journey and you get better and that\u2019s the whole point of life.\n\nGraham: Try working at the BBC. Easy for you to say, Mr ITV over there. Going back to the comedy, I think there is something about drag that gives performers licence to do stuff. Every performer that gets on stage has a persona, you\u2019re never truly yourself \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter who you are. You\u2019re putting something on, but I think, because in drag you are hidden, you can say and do things and an audience will allow you to do them. Like [US drag queen] Bianca Del Rio does material that no one else is doing \u2013 Joan Rivers type stuff. A proper insult comic. And that isn\u2019t that popular right now. But she\u2019s getting away with it.\n\nIt does seem that with drag queens the bar for what is deemed acceptable is slightly lower.\n\nAlan: Because you\u2019re otherworldly: your rules don\u2019t apply to this world.\n\nGraham: You\u2019ve already broken so many rules just to get on stage. It gives you a freedom and there\u2019s something dangerous about drag still, and I enjoy that.\n\nDo you think things are getting worse for LGBT people in Britain?\n\nGraham: Well, they\u2019re certainly repetitive. Why does anyone study history? Why do we bother?\n\nAlan: The one thing you do learn from history is that you don\u2019t learn from history. It\u2019s becoming a bit of a minefield \u2013 just the semantics and the language. I feel as if we can\u2019t really get to the problems, because we have to tiptoe through this minefield of language. It would be nice just to get it all out on the table and discuss, but I think sometimes social media can blur all that.\n\nGraham: Twitter, I think, must destroy some young gays. If you stick your head above the parapet and you retweet the wrong thing, or you comment on the wrong thing, suddenly you must think the world is so ugly, and so horrible. And I think that\u2019s properly dangerous. Because when you\u2019re a kid, the one thing you don\u2019t know is that this is just going to blow over. And even though people are saying they want to rip your head off and shit down your throat, they\u2019re never going to say boo to you if they see you in the street.\n\nAlan, I read somewhere that you live on a farm with Julian Clary and Paul O\u2019Grady. Is that true?\n\nAlan: No! I mean it sounds like the most amazing sitcom, but yeah, it\u2019s been said that I live on a farm with Paul O\u2019Grady and Julian Clary, and I would love it to be true, but it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t know where that came from.\n\nGraham: But you do farm, don\u2019t you?\n\nAlan: Well, I just mince around in some wellies [on his husband, Paul\u2019s farm]. I am so crap down there, because it\u2019s all shit and death. You see an animal on it\u2019s side and you\u2019re like: \u201cPlease be a narcoleptic, please don\u2019t be dying, please be having a kip.\u201d I can\u2019t bear it.\n\nSo there\u2019s no chance of you doing a farming show on telly?\n\nAlan: No. Listen, I\u2019ve had the phone calls. I know how they want me \u2013 they want me pulling a cow\u2019s teat, screaming \u201cAh! Ah!\u201d [mimes milking a cow]. They want another Rebecca Loos.\n\nSo, just to bring it back to drag \u2026\n\nGraham: Speaking of death and shit.\n\nThere are now children growing up thinking: \u201cI want to be a drag queen.\u201d Graham Norton\n\nDo you think drag is here to stay in mainstream culture or is it just having a moment?\n\nGraham: When Drag Race started, drag was nobody\u2019s first choice. Something had happened in your life. You failed at something else. Or you were hiding from something or there was some story before you got to the moment where you were dressed as a woman, lip syncing. I think that\u2019s changed. There are now children growing up thinking: \u201cI want to be a drag queen.\u201d\n\nAlan: It will never go away. I mean, listen, you know, in the Bible \u2013 obviously I haven\u2019t read it for ages \u2026\n\nGraham: Well, we didn\u2019t expect this, did we! We did not see this coming.\n\nAlan: Wasn\u2019t there something in the Bible about how [men] should never wear women\u2019s clothes or the other sex\u2019s clothes, what was that all about? There\u2019s something about transvestism and drag in the Bible, I swear it. So it\u2019s been around for ages. I think it will be around for ever because it is a state of mind. There\u2019s a male energy and a female energy and I think you get it in performers like Prince, Michael Jackson, George Michael, David Bowie \u2013 there is something magnetic in that fight between male and female going on before your eyes. And I feel in good drag you can\u2019t take your eyes off of it.\n\nGraham: That is really true.\n\nAlan: That\u2019s actually deep. But cut out the Bible bit. I think we all knew I was out of my depth.\n\nGraham: I hope drag is here to stay because I really enjoy it. Instagram drag may go away \u2013 the idea of boys sitting in their bedrooms painting their faces. But actual drag performers \u2013 \u2018It\u2019s midnight ladies and gentlemen, please welcome \u2026\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s going to go on for ever.\n\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK starts on BBC Three on 3 October at 8pm and will be exclusively available on BBC iPlayer", "description": "As RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race comes to the UK, two of its judges discuss homophobia, the celebrity they first fancied \u2013 and why today\u2019s comedy audiences want more kindness", "authors": ["Chris Godfrey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48a0594d0dced1d4f2c82cd5678c312dbea2a01/113_657_4940_2964/master/4940.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cc665b505b0faf17e31674f9fdeb2ade", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
