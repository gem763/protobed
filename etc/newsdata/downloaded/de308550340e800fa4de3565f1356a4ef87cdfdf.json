Like the DUP, they are not just hostile to the EU, but they are passionate unionists. If the DUP accept that the Brexit deal preserves Northern Ireland as a part of the UK, then that is good enough for most of them.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I think the easiest way to work it out is to start with the last vote on May\u2019s deal, on 29 March, when she was defeated by a margin of 58 votes. That is, she needed 30 MPs to vote \u201cAye\u201d instead of \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nSince then, the Tories have lost one seat to the Lib Dems in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, so Johnson needs to flip 31 votes. (Two Tory MPs have also defected to the Lib Dems since then \u2013 Phillip Lee and Sam Gyimah \u2013 but they voted against the deal anyway, because they want to cancel Brexit; they can\u2019t be persuaded to vote for any deal.)\n\nJohnson hopes to win over the 28 Eurosceptic Tories who refused to vote for May\u2019s deal, and who revel in the nickname \u201cthe Spartans\u201d, in ignorance of what happened in the battle of Thermopylae, a heroic defeat.\n\nHe has appointed four of them to jobs, including Priti Patel and Theresa Villiers, and Steve Baker, chair of the European Research Group, was consulted on the prime minister\u2019s proposals and supported them.\n\nSome of the Spartans, such as Owen Paterson, are said to be unhappy that Johnson has conceded too much, so it is possible that a handful of them will hold out, but my guess is that, if the DUP remain in favour, about 25 of the 28 will vote for the deal.\n\nThat would give Johnson the votes he needs: 25 Tories plus 10 DUP.\n\nIt is possible, however, that some of the 20 ex-Tory MPs currently sitting as independents who voted for May\u2019s deal might switch from \u201cAye\u201d to \u201cNo\u201d. Amber Rudd, for example, who gave up the Tory whip voluntarily, said she thought Johnson\u2019s deal would \u201chit manufacturing\u201d. David Gauke, the former justice secretary who ran Rory Stewart\u2019s leadership campaign, was worried it might incur an \u201cunnecessarily high economic cost\u201d. But others in this group look forward to returning to the Tory fold if they vote with the government.\n\nWhat is more, Tory switchers against the deal might be offset by MPs of other parties switching in the opposite direction. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP, leads a group called \u201cMPs for a Deal\u201d, which has 12 Labour members who didn\u2019t vote for May\u2019s deal but say they could vote for a new deal if it respects workers\u2019 rights \u2013 plus one Lib Dem, Norman Lamb, who is standing down at the next election.\n\nI doubt if many of the 12 Labour MPs will vote for the deal, especially as Jeremy Corbyn has shown an uncharacteristic disciplinarian streak and threatened to expel them if they do so, which would prevent their standing as Labour candidates next time. But Kate Hoey and Graham Stringer, Labour\u2019s own Spartans, will probably also vote for a deal if the DUP does.\n\nSo Johnson could have the votes in the Commons for a deal, as long as he has the DUP on his side. But his fate could be decided by ex-Tory and Labour \u201csoft Brexiters\u201d including Rudd, Gauke and Kinnock.", "description": "Boris Johnson has built his Brexit negotiation on the two people who were furthest apart: Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, and Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party.\u00a0 Unexpectedly, in face-to-face talks in Merseyside last week, Johnson and Varadkar agreed \u201cthey could see a pathway to a possible deal\u201d.
