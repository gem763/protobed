It certainly does not feel like something that has a whole lot of teeth or ambition,\" said Bruno Sarda of CDP North America (CDP was formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project).\n\nHe notes that intensity targets allow overall emissions to keep rising, even if production is more efficient.\n\nIndeed, that distinction between intensity and absolute emissions is evident in Chevron's announcement.\n\n\u201cGlobal demand for energy continues to grow, and we are committed to delivering more energy with less environmental impact,\u201d CEO Michael Wirth said.\n\nBy the numbers: Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company behind Exxon, said that by 2023, it would cut emissions intensity of its oil production by 5-10% and intensity of natural gas production by 2-5% by then.\n\nBoth are relative to 2016 levels, which the Houston Chronicle points out provides the company \"a significant head start.\"\n\nWhat's next: More pressure on Chevron from activist investors. \u201cThe pressure is going to continue until they make a commitment to absolute emissions reductions that align with the science,\u201d Sarda said.\n\nOne area to watch: Chevron, and several other majors, have not followed a small handful of European players including Shell and Total S.A. in setting goals for reducing emissions from the use of their fuels in the economy.\n\nChevron, and several other majors, have not followed a small handful of European players including Shell and Total S.A. in setting goals for reducing emissions from the use of their fuels in the economy. \"Investor concern is not focused on operational emissions \u2014 which is what this [new Chevron] goal addresses \u2014 but on the carbon embedded in the industry's core products,\" Andrew Logan of the sustainable investment advocacy group Ceres tells me.\n\nGo deeper: Sizing up Big Oil's clean tech moves", "description": "It hasn't been as aggressive on the issue as other Big Oil companies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/WVH4wcPi1kPpmp5U6wgvwy5YDO0=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/04/1570194747656.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
