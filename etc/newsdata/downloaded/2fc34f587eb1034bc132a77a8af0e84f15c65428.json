Dwayne Johnson films in order of least to most ridiculous Show all 31 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. Dwayne Johnson films in order of least to most ridiculous 1/31 31. Gridiron Gang (2006) Loosely based on the true story of the Kilpatrick Mustangs \u2013 a team comprising teenagers at a juvenile detention camp \u2013 Gridiron Gang would be more at home near the top of a list ranking Dwayne Johnson's most clich\u00e9d films than ridiculous. Columbia Pictures 2/31 30. Snitch (2013) Snitch is an extremely straightforward action thriller with a lead character that ranks as Johnson's most believable: a father who goes undercover for the DEA to free his son who's imprisoned after being framed for drug dealing. The film was actually inspired by a documentary on new federal drug policies designed to encourage felons to snitch on their accomplices. Summit Entertainment 3/31 29. Walking Tall (2004) A former US soldier who takes matters into his own hands after returning home to find his town overrun by crime is perhaps the role Johnson was born to play. Because of this, it ranks fairly high on the believability scale \u2013 seeing The Rock smash cars to pieces with a baseball bat is pretty tame compared to his actions in recent films. MGM Distribution Co 4/31 28. The Other Guys (2010) Johnson makes a hilariously brief cameo in Will Ferrell/Mark Wahlberg buddy comedy The Other Guys, which kicks into gear when the pair are forced to replace the NYPD\u2019s superstar detective duo of Johnson and Samuel L Jackson. Veritable action heroes on the New York streets, they are cocky, revered and incredibly expensive, costing the city millions of dollars in property damage every time they hit the beat. But because The Other Guys generally takes place in reality, Johnson and Jackson\u2019s characters end up smack-down dead on concrete, riding high on their own confidence, after a foot chase spins out of control. It\u2019s comic genius, and a Dwayne Johnson movie has never been more real. Columbia Pictures 5/31 27. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2018) Incredibly successful Jumanji reboot Welcome to the Jungle has its fair share of nuttiness, Johnson and his cohorts Jack Black, Karen Gillan and Kevin Hart fending off rhinos, hungry hippos and angry militia men. But it\u2019s also set entirely in a video game, Johnson embodying a fictional action hero avatar known as Dr Smolder Bravestone, and therefore resistant to such typically important factors as \u201crules\u201d or \u201clogic\u201d. It\u2019s basically believability Kryptonite. Sony Pictures Releasing 6/31 26. Be Cool (2005) Otherwise appalling whenever he\u2019s not on screen, Be Cool casts Johnson as a character whose absurdity has become increasingly less absurd as time has gone on. Back in 2005, casting Johnson as an aspiring actor desperate to make the big time, only to be ultimately rewarded with a starring role in a romantic drama titled Samoan Rendezvous alongside Nicole Kidman, felt ludicrous \u2013 but in light of how he has ascended the Hollywood ladder since, not so much. He also recreates a monologue from Bring It On, for what it\u2019s worth. MGM Distribution Co 7/31 25. Central Intelligence (2016) Central Intelligence is big and broad as a comedy, its tagline (\u201cSaving the world takes a little Hart and a big Johnson\u201d) every bit the indicator of the film\u2019s tone. But this vehicle for recurring co-stars Johnson and Kevin Hart is surprisingly authentic to their off-screen personas. Johnson plays a formerly obese school nerd who has grown into a wise and sensitive CIA agent \u2013 basically a fun-house mirror version of his transformation from high school turtleneck-wearer to A-list movie star. Universal Pictures 8/31 24. Faster (2010) A grimy and underrated action vehicle for Johnson, Faster marked his last stand as a vaguely (and trust us with this) chameleon-like actor, before he became \u201cDwayne Johnson\u201d and developed a particular strain of tics and trademarks. He\u2019s a getaway driver known as Driver, hunted by a killer known as Killer, and in pursuit of a corrupt cop called Cop. The lack of names nods to classic Westerns, but if anything, this is true pulp fiction cinema, with a mood that\u2019s more noir and heightened than plain stupid. CBS Films 9/31 23. Get Smart (2008) Get Smart's existence as a film version of the classic spy series is what allows viewers to swallow the antics of its characters led by Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway. The extent of its ridiculousness is Carell's analyst being thrust into the field operative position after a terrorist organisation exposes the identity of all agents at the intelligence unit he works at. Beyond that, anything goes. Warner Bros Pictures 10/31 22. The Game Plan (2007) Dwayne Johnson is, by all accounts, an incredibly nice guy. Even his minor political scandals are rectified within minutes with entirely acceptable apologies. But it makes parts like the one he plays in The Game Plan, that of a self-involved American football player uninterested in bonding with his long-lost daughter, particularly hard to believe. He bonds with her in the end, however \u2013 Madison Pettis\u2019s gap-toothed, lispy charm breaking through Johnson\u2019s harsh exterior per Disney family film tradition. Buena Vista Pictures 11/31 21. GI Joe: Retaliation (2013) Deadpool writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick were behind GI Joe: Retaliation, the oh-so-loud sequel to the film based on Hasbro's toy franchise. Johnson joined the cast as Roadblock, an artillery specialist who \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 saved the day and is set to return in a new crossover film with the Transformers. Paramount Pictures 12/31 20. Welcome to the Jungle (2003) This old-school action-adventure \u2013 called The Rundown in the US \u2013 nods to the Dwayne Johnson of the future (hell, the title even predated his 2017 Jumanji reboot). It's a suitably zany jungle treasure hunt in the vein of Romancing the Stone. Christopher Walken is the bad guy, Rosario Dawson is the beautiful woman along for the ride and Seann William Scott, aka the Chris Pratt that should have been, is the comic relief, with Johnson troubled by explosions, car wrecks and very angry monkeys. Columbia Pictures 13/31 19. Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (2012) The most ridiculous aspect of Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, a follow-up to the Brendan Fraser-starring Journey to the Centre of the Earth? Michael Caine as an eccentric grandfather who lives in a hut made from the wreckage of a ship. Everything else is pretty standard for a family adventure. Warner Bros Pictures 14/31 18. Race to Witch Mountain (2009) Johnson is a Los Angeles taxi driver who inadvertently picks up two alien children that need to retrieve their spaceship and return home. Race to Witch Mountain is also a Disney movie, released smack-dab in Johnson\u2019s early \u201ccutesy family film\u201d phase and desperately unremarkable as a result. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures 15/31 17. Doom (2005) A film so silly that even Johnson has expressed his regrets about it, this (ahem) doomed adaptation of the popular video game saw him in boring Sylvester Stallone mode. He\u2019s the muscle in a team of scientists battling a zombie virus located in a portal to Mars discovered in the desert outside Vegas. It also (spoiler alert) builds to a highly unbelievable ending in which Johnson is overpowered and turned into a zombie but then thrown into the Mars portal by tiny hero Karl Urban. Puh-lease. Universal Pictures 16/31 16. Southland Tales (2006) Far and away the most bonkers film in Johnson\u2019s filmography but also his most interesting by proxy, Southland Tales only makes sense if you really, really want it to. He\u2019s an amnesiac action movie star entangled in a Republican Party conspiracy that involves neo-Marxist revolutionaries and something called the \u201cthe fourth dimension\u201d. It\u2019s also an oddly prophetic movie in how it depicts pornography, reality television and politics as overlapping and dependent on one another, and in the political aspirations of Johnson\u2019s character. When Johnson hinted in 2017 that he may one day run for office, it made Southland Tales seem that bit less absurd. Universal Pictures 17/31 15. Baywatch (2017) Why exactly are lifeguards investigating murders? It's a question you'll be asking throughout the big screen version of Baywatch, which is more smutty than the TV show ever was. One scene sees Alexandra Daddario's lifeguard tell a male colleague, played by Zac Efron, to look at her face instead of staring at her boobs. \u201cI\u2019m trying,\" he replies, \"but it\u2019s so close to your boobs.\" Yikes. Paramount Picture 18/31 14. The Scorpion King (2002) Beloved by anyone who was between the ages of 10 and 12 when it came out, The Scorpion King was Johnson\u2019s first starring role, and inexplicably decent considering the CGI eye-sore teaser it received in the earlier Mummy Returns. The Scorpion King is, naturally, swords-and-sandals cheese, with an array of sub-Indiana Jones set pieces including a memorable one involving Johnson being buried up to his neck in the ground and forced to squash a number of approaching fire ants with his chin. There\u2019s also a wacky camel sidekick, which only increases the enjoyable madness of it all. Universal Pictures 19/31 13. The Mummy Returns (2001) The Mummy Returns is Johnson\u2019s debut in a high-profile movie, and shamefully, he\u2019s overshadowed by an infamously horrid CGI version of himself, who also sports giant crab legs for some reason. Granted, this is less a cameo than a teaser for a Mummy spin-off, but it\u2019s a dismal use of a man who would quickly emerge as one of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars. Universal Pictures 20/31 12. Hercules (2014) In Hercules, Dwayne Johnson leads a band of mercenaries comprising a king-turned-prophet named Amphiaraus of Argos, a knife-wielding thief known as Autolycus of Sparta and the Amazon archer Atalanta of Scythia. So, there we go. Paramount Pictures 21/31 11. Longshot (2001) In 2000, boy band impresario and future convicted fraudster Lou Pearlman wrote romantic comedy film Longshot that would covertly serve as a promotional tool for teen-pop acts on the Jive Records label at the turn of the millennium. As a result, Britney Spears and *NSYNC are among the stars roped in to provide cameos. As for Dwayne Johnson, in his cinematic debut, he gets 15 seconds of screen-time as an armed mugger swiftly pummelled to the ground by a late-1990s dreamboat with a ponytail who looks like someone who was this close to becoming a member of O-Town. Believability rating: zero. Transcontinental Pictures 22/31 10. Pain & Gain (2013) Murder, kidnap, torture, extortion \u2013 it's hard to believe that Michael Bay's Pain & Gain is based on a true story by Pete Collins that was posted in Miami New Times in 1999. Well, that's because it's loosely based on real events with several of the film's key moments fabricated somewhat. Take, for instance, the scene in which Johnson's character robs an armoured truck and gets his toe shot off while escaping \u2013 entirely fictional. Paramount Pictures 23/31 9. Fast & Furious 6 (2013) Most things are tamer than the fifth Fast & Furious film, but the franchise's sixth outing is not one of them largely thanks to a climactic scene that sees the crew tether their vehicles to a plane in order to stop it from taking off. Universal Pictures 24/31 8. Fast & Furious 7 (2015) Johnson's character is mostly bedbound in Fast & Furious 8 so has to sit out most of the crew's hijinks, including a breathless sequence that sees them drop several cars from a plane while it's 10,000 feet in the air. Johnson is still handed the most ridiculous moment, though: watching his friends thrown into danger on a hospital television, he decides enough is enough and breaks out of his cast \u2013 by tensing his muscles. Universal Pictures 25/31 7. Rampage (2018) Rampage puts its plot forward so sincerely that, while watching it, you almost forget how ridiculous the whole thing is. Johnson plays primatologist Davis Okoye who must team up with an enormous albino gorilla to stop a mutated wolf and crocodile from wreaking destruction on the world. Warner Bros Pictures 26/31 6. Skyscraper (2018) The one Dwayne Johnson movie just too absurd for audiences, in that it was one of his few box office bombs in recent years, Skyscraper descended new heights of improbability. Johnson\u2019s one-legged security guard is the Bruce Willis of this 255-floor spin on Die Hard, whose most sensational feat involves climbing a 96-story crane, running along its extension and then leaping into the burning skyscraper nearby that happens to have trapped his family inside. It gets believability points for recruiting Neve Campbell as Johnson\u2019s nicely age-appropriate wife, but otherwise is a logistical disaster. Mythbusters would need an entire season of episodes to get to the bottom of it. Universal Pictures 27/31 5. Fast & Furious 5 (2011) With just one car chase, Fast & Furious 5 was the film that reinvented the franchise. Gone were the street races of the series' earlier instalments in favour of higher stake-storylines, such as the bank heist at the heart of this film. It culminates in one of the most entertaining sequences in action film history \u2013 the crew dragging a giant vault through the city of Rio and using it to take out the police cars chasing them. Universal Pictures 28/31 4. San Andreas (2015) Shortly after her sister-in-law Kylie Minogue plummets off the edge of a collapsing building, Carla Gugino clambers to safety by leap-frogging her way onto various pieces of falling debris until she manages to reach her ex (Johnson) in the helicopter he is piloting above her. It is somehow not the most ludicrous moment in the film. San Andreas takes a very believable disaster-movie scenario (the collapse of the San Andreas Fault), and then Dwayne Johnsons it. He\u2019s an agreeably solemn hero here (San Andreas is more Sans Quipping, in truth), but everything around him is peak insanity. Warner Bros Pictures 29/31 3. Fast & Furious 8 (2017) The writers of Fast & Furious, forced to outdo each other with every new film, threw two outlandish sequences into the eighth instalment. One involved a nuclear submarine (of course) and the other was a lengthy prison riot that tracked Johnson's character's escape from high-security lockup alongside Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw. Universal Pictures 30/31 2. Tooth Fairy (2010) When someone told Dwayne Johnson to become a household name by going down the family film route, he really listened. In 2010, he played a minor-league hockey player who, after telling his daughter that the tooth fairy doesn't exist, is sentenced to one week as the actual tooth fairy. 20th Century Fox 31/31 1. Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw (2019) One day, not too long ago, it would have been difficult to think that the Fast & Furious franchise would feature *ahem* Jason Statham in the co-leading role, a literal walking terminator (played by Idris Elba, no less) and Dwayne Johnson lassoing a helicopter with a chain from a moving truck... but here we are. Universal Pictures 1/31 31. Gridiron Gang (2006) Loosely based on the true story of the Kilpatrick Mustangs \u2013 a team comprising teenagers at a juvenile detention camp \u2013 Gridiron Gang would be more at home near the top of a list ranking Dwayne Johnson's most clich\u00e9d films than ridiculous. Columbia Pictures 2/31 30.

In 2010, he played a minor-league hockey player who, after telling his daughter that the tooth fairy doesn't exist, is sentenced to one week as the actual tooth fairy. 20th Century Fox 31/31 1. Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw (2019) One day, not too long ago, it would have been difficult to think that the Fast & Furious franchise would feature *ahem* Jason Statham in the co-leading role, a literal walking terminator (played by Idris Elba, no less) and Dwayne Johnson lassoing a helicopter with a chain from a moving truck... but here we are.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD\u2019s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers. Marvel/Disney 2/23 Thor: The Dark World 22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones\u2019s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It\u2019s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston\u2019s Malekith is (by far) Marvel\u2019s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth\u2019s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history. Marvel/Disney 3/23 The Incredible Hulk 21. Edward Norton\u2019s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans \u2013 and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo\u2019s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton\u2019s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story. Marvel/Disney 4/23 Avengers: Age of Ultron 20. Just in case we\u2019d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012\u2019s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth\u2019s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic \u201cI\u2019ve Got No Strings\u201d from 1940\u2019s Pinocchio. It\u2019s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It\u2019s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU. Marvel/Disney 5/23 Thor 19. Although Kenneth Branagh\u2019s introductory outing for Marvel\u2019s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it\u2019s suffered massively from the MCU\u2019s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston\u2019s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth\u2019s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial \u201cfish out of water\u201d trope. Marvel/Disney 6/23 Doctor Strange 18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential \u2013 sound familiar? That\u2019s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr\u2019s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. Marvel/Disney 7/23 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 17. The first Guardians of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt\u2019s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line \u201cI\u2019m Mary Poppins, y\u2019all\u201d, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches. Marvel/Disney 8/23 The Avengers 16. Marvel\u2019s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event \u2013 one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the \u201cshared universe\u201d approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It\u2019s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the \u201cBattle of New York\u201d finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary. Marvel/Disney 9/23 Captain America: Civil War 15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that\u2019s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works \u2013 were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book. Marvel/Disney 10/23 Ant-Man and the Wasp 14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in spandex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly\u2019s Hope van Dyne \u2013 a smart, capable female hero who didn\u2019t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters. Marvel/Disney 11/23 Spider-Man: Far From Home 13. What comes after the end? It\u2019s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there\u2019s a lot to be said for the fact it isn\u2019t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man. AP 12/23 Ant-Man 12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work \u2013 let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel/Disney 13/23 Avengers: Infinity War 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade\u2019s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who\u2019s a newcomer to the franchise (if that\u2019s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover \u2013 from the Guardians of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda \u2013 work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU\u2019s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history. Marvel/Disney 14/23 Captain America: The First Avenger 10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film\u2019s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress. Marvel/Disney 15/23 Captain America: The Winter Soldier 9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier \u2013 an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Marvel/Disney 16/23 Captain Marvel 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that's both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio\u2019s formula, the superhero's debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers. Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU. Marvel/Disney 17/23 Spider-Man: Homecoming 7. While Spider-Man\u2019s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland\u2019s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield\u2019s version, thanks to the film\u2019s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton\u2019s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done. Marvel/Disney 18/23 Iron Man 3 6. While divisive among Marvel fans, Shane Black\u2019s superhero outing \u2013 with the writer/director\u2019s sharp, stinging dialogue \u2013 brings Tony Stark's story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr\u2019s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off. Marvel/Disney 19/23 Avengers: Endgame 5. It\u2019s a film that\u2019s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about individual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. AP 20/23 Thor: Ragnarok 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he\u2019d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate individual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success. Marvel/Disney 21/23 Iron Man 3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world \u2013 a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. Marvel/Disney 22/23 Guardians of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, Guardians of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today. Marvel/Disney 23/23 Black Panther 1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler\u2019s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman\u2019s T\u2019Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan\u2019s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It\u2019s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama. Marvel/Disney 1/23 Iron Man 2 23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD\u2019s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers. Marvel/Disney 2/23 Thor: The Dark World 22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones\u2019s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It\u2019s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston\u2019s Malekith is (by far) Marvel\u2019s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth\u2019s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history. Marvel/Disney 3/23 The Incredible Hulk 21. Edward Norton\u2019s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans \u2013 and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo\u2019s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton\u2019s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story. Marvel/Disney 4/23 Avengers: Age of Ultron 20. Just in case we\u2019d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012\u2019s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth\u2019s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic \u201cI\u2019ve Got No Strings\u201d from 1940\u2019s Pinocchio. It\u2019s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It\u2019s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU. Marvel/Disney 5/23 Thor 19. Although Kenneth Branagh\u2019s introductory outing for Marvel\u2019s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it\u2019s suffered massively from the MCU\u2019s dramatic sense of progression over the years.

Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth\u2019s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial \u201cfish out of water\u201d trope. Marvel/Disney 6/23 Doctor Strange 18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential \u2013 sound familiar? That\u2019s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr\u2019s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen.

Marvel\u2019s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event \u2013 one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the \u201cshared universe\u201d approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It\u2019s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the \u201cBattle of New York\u201d finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary. Marvel/Disney 9/23 Captain America: Civil War 15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that\u2019s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works \u2013 were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted.

While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in spandex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly\u2019s Hope van Dyne \u2013 a smart, capable female hero who didn\u2019t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters. Marvel/Disney 11/23 Spider-Man: Far From Home 13. What comes after the end? It\u2019s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there\u2019s a lot to be said for the fact it isn\u2019t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man. AP 12/23 Ant-Man 12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title!

This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. AP 20/23 Thor: Ragnarok 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he\u2019d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate individual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success. Marvel/Disney 21/23 Iron Man 3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster.

And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today. Marvel/Disney 23/23 Black Panther 1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler\u2019s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman\u2019s T\u2019Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan\u2019s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It\u2019s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.

Star Wars films \u2013 ranked worst to best 1/10 Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones (2002) The prequel trilogy has lived on in infamy, but the true low point of this low point in the Star Wars franchise must be Attack of the Clones, the dry, crusted middle of the cinematic sandwich. While Revenge of the Sith has some sense of completion and The Phantom Menace has some sense of wonder, all Attack of the Clones has is a CGI Yoda bopping about the screen like an unswattable fly while battling Christopher Lee\u2019s Count Dooku. It\u2019s a film driven by unnecessary desires: from the space politics, to Boba Fett\u2019s backstory, to Padm\u00e9 and Anakin\u2019s romance. The latter is the most insufferable, since George Lucas never had much of an ear for dialogue, as notoriously pointed out by Harrison Ford when he declared on set: \u201cGeorge, you can type this s***, but you sure as hell can\u2019t say it.\u201d Which leads us to one of the worst line readings in cinematic history, when Hayden Christensen\u2019s Anakin laments: \u201cI don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating \u2013 and it gets everywhere.\u201d Rex Features 2/10 Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (2005) Hollywood has increasingly made the assumption that \u201cdarker\u201d means better when it comes to cinema \u2013 it explains why the Harry Potter films look like they were made while someone gradually turned down the dimmer switch on the studio lights. Of course, audiences know that \u201cdarker\u201d sometimes means that your protagonist-turned-villain becomes a \u201cyoungling\u201d-murdering, amateur street magician-looking sourpuss. Anakin\u2019s arc here comes to a whimper of an ending, underlined by the much-derided decision to have Darth Vader\u2019s first moments onscreen involve him howling \u201cNoooooo!\u201d up to the sky like a mournful hound. That said, Ewan McGregor confirms here that he managed to escape the franchise largely unscathed, as this instalment sees him have the most fun with the clunky dialogue (see: \u201cHello there!\u201d and \u201cI have the high ground!\u201d). Rex Features 3/10 Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) The Phantom Menace escapes slightly ahead of the rest of the prequel trilogy, if only for the fact it remembers these films are meant to be fun once in a while. The pod race \u2013 it\u2019s a good scene! Darth Maul is all looks, zero follow through \u2013 it\u2019s embarrassing to act like you\u2019ve won, only to be cut in half and sent hurtling down an exhaust pipe \u2013 but his inclusion in the film did introduce one of the best musical themes in Star Wars history, John Williams\u2019s \u201cDuel of the Fates\u201d. However, the space politics are a particular drag here, with all the talk of trade disputes, and, of course, it's obligatory to mention the terror that is Jar Jar Binks. Rex 4/10 Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) Although it\u2019s the weakest of the new generation of Star Wars films, Solo still holds up as a fun romp worthy of Han Solo\u2019s rascal reputation. Alden Ehrenreich picks up on enough of Harrison Ford\u2019s mannerisms to sell the character without sliding into imitation, while Donald Glover is a scene stealer from the very moment he walks on screen as Lando Calrissian. It\u2019s a lost opportunity, then, that the film is otherwise slowed down by an impulse to offer backstory to as many aspects of Han\u2019s character as possible. Did we really need to know how we got the name \u201cSolo\u201d? Really? Rex Features 5/10 Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) There\u2019s a lot to wrap up in the concluding chapter of the original trilogy. The result is a few odd turns for the sake of plot convenience. What does one do with a character as enigmatic as Boba Fett? Why, have him topple into the Sarlacc pit within the first 20 minutes! How does one put to rest the love triangle hinted at in A New Hope? Why, insert a revelation that Luke and Leia are, in fact, brother and sister! Even the second Death Star oddly feels sillier than The Force Awakens and its third attempt at a giant ball in space, since The First Order at least had the excuse that their obsessive admiration of the Empire may have clouded their judgement. That said, there\u2019s still plenty of charm to be found here and the Ewoks aren\u2019t all that bad. Before you dismiss them as irritating merchandise opportunities, it\u2019s worth remembering that they have absolutely no qualms about killing and eating people. Rex Features 6/10 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) If Rogue One is any indication of Disney\u2019s plans for the franchise and its future, then there\u2019s no cause for concern. The first of the \u201cA Star Wars Story\u201d spin-offs, it shifts into gear with ease, soothing audiences by not straying too far from the familiar timeline while introducing a full set of new characters and a grittier tone. Stylistically, it feels more like a Vietnam War movie and is proof of how far a gifted director like Gareth Edwards can stray from the franchise\u2019s usual formula and still feel grounded in the same world. Plus, you have to admire the guts it takes to deliver an ending like that\u2026 Rex Features 7/10 Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015) Disney made a very smart move with The Force Awakens. As the first Star Wars film of a new generation, it not only had to make its own mark, but feel familiar enough that it welcomed fans back with open arms. The balance is hit perfectly here. That\u2019s largely due to the film\u2019s new trio of central heroes, who radiate the same kind of warmth, bravery, and spirit that carved a special place in people\u2019s hearts when they were first introduced to the franchise\u2019s original stars. Daisy Ridley\u2019s Rey, John Boyega\u2019s Finn, and Oscar Isaac\u2019s Poe honour Star Wars's past while striding into its unknown future. It also helps that the film has landed on a villain like Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), whose drive and complexity may see him surpass even Darth Vader by the end of his story in Episode IX. Rex Features 8/10 Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017) Any divisiveness the film attracted certainly proved one thing: here\u2019s a Star Wars film that actually took a creative risk. And what a bold, ambitious, and ultimately beautiful risk that was. Director Rian Johnson took the cinematic legacy presented before him and added a new richness to its textures. He allowed heroism to go beyond the clean divide between good and evil; through Luke and Rey, we were taught not to be ashamed of our doubts but to grow stronger because of them. We were taught not to use destiny as a crutch, but to know when to forge our own paths. The Last Jedi is a soulful film told through some of the most striking cinematography of the entire franchise. Rex Features 9/10 Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) It\u2019s the place where it all began. The Star Wars franchise has only become the success it is today because of how purely revolutionary the first instalment was as a piece of Hollywood filmmaking. It is, to this day, one of the most successful examples of the modern epic, endlessly imitated but so rarely with the same heart or ambition. George Lucas tapped into one of the most timeless qualities of storytelling: its ability to let us see and understand our own world through the eyes of another. Star Wars has become so iconic because, even on such a grand scale, we know and relate to the emotions at hand \u2013 fear, love, or a desire to do what\u2019s right. Rex Features 10/10 Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) The Empire Strikes Back is remarkable in its ability to pursue real emotional stakes. Its closing moments, the final note to its symphony of sacrifice and tragedy, leaves us with the single, delicate emotion that is hope, blooming in the darkness as our heroes set out to save Han and restore the Rebel Alliance. What A New Hope built up by making us fall in love with these characters, The Empire Strikes Back recouped in sharing with us their pain and their fears. Darth Vader\u2019s reveal that he\u2019s Luke\u2019s father has, of course, found its place in history, but there\u2019s an equal sense of emotional resonance in the moment Leia and Han depart, moments before he\u2019s trapped in carbonite. When Leia\u2019s \u201cI love you\u201d is returned by Han\u2019s \u201cI know\u201d \u2013 a line written by Harrison Ford himself \u2013 we\u2019re reminded of how magical Star Wars\u2019s sense of storytelling can be, condensing everything that these two characters feel for each other into five simple words. Rex Features 1/10 Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones (2002) The prequel trilogy has lived on in infamy, but the true low point of this low point in the Star Wars franchise must be Attack of the Clones, the dry, crusted middle of the cinematic sandwich. While Revenge of the Sith has some sense of completion and The Phantom Menace has some sense of wonder, all Attack of the Clones has is a CGI Yoda bopping about the screen like an unswattable fly while battling Christopher Lee\u2019s Count Dooku.

It's coarse and rough and irritating \u2013 and it gets everywhere.\u201d Rex Features 2/10 Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (2005) Hollywood has increasingly made the assumption that \u201cdarker\u201d means better when it comes to cinema \u2013 it explains why the Harry Potter films look like they were made while someone gradually turned down the dimmer switch on the studio lights. Of course, audiences know that \u201cdarker\u201d sometimes means that your protagonist-turned-villain becomes a \u201cyoungling\u201d-murdering, amateur street magician-looking sourpuss.

Rex Features 6/10 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) If Rogue One is any indication of Disney\u2019s plans for the franchise and its future, then there\u2019s no cause for concern. The first of the \u201cA Star Wars Story\u201d spin-offs, it shifts into gear with ease, soothing audiences by not straying too far from the familiar timeline while introducing a full set of new characters and a grittier tone. Stylistically, it feels more like a Vietnam War movie and is proof of how far a gifted director like Gareth Edwards can stray from the franchise\u2019s usual formula and still feel grounded in the same world. Plus, you have to admire the guts it takes to deliver an ending like that\u2026 Rex Features 7/10 Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015) Disney made a very smart move with The Force Awakens. As the first Star Wars film of a new generation, it not only had to make its own mark, but feel familiar enough that it welcomed fans back with open arms. The balance is hit perfectly here. That\u2019s largely due to the film\u2019s new trio of central heroes, who radiate the same kind of warmth, bravery, and spirit that carved a special place in people\u2019s hearts when they were first introduced to the franchise\u2019s original stars. Daisy Ridley\u2019s Rey, John Boyega\u2019s Finn, and Oscar Isaac\u2019s Poe honour Star Wars's past while striding into its unknown future. It also helps that the film has landed on a villain like Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), whose drive and complexity may see him surpass even Darth Vader by the end of his story in Episode IX. Rex Features 8/10 Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017) Any divisiveness the film attracted certainly proved one thing: here\u2019s a Star Wars film that actually took a creative risk. And what a bold, ambitious, and ultimately beautiful risk that was. Director Rian Johnson took the cinematic legacy presented before him and added a new richness to its textures. He allowed heroism to go beyond the clean divide between good and evil; through Luke and Rey, we were taught not to be ashamed of our doubts but to grow stronger because of them. We were taught not to use destiny as a crutch, but to know when to forge our own paths. The Last Jedi is a soulful film told through some of the most striking cinematography of the entire franchise. Rex Features 9/10 Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) It\u2019s the place where it all began. The Star Wars franchise has only become the success it is today because of how purely revolutionary the first instalment was as a piece of Hollywood filmmaking. It is, to this day, one of the most successful examples of the modern epic, endlessly imitated but so rarely with the same heart or ambition. George Lucas tapped into one of the most timeless qualities of storytelling: its ability to let us see and understand our own world through the eyes of another. Star Wars has become so iconic because, even on such a grand scale, we know and relate to the emotions at hand \u2013 fear, love, or a desire to do what\u2019s right. Rex Features 10/10 Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) The Empire Strikes Back is remarkable in its ability to pursue real emotional stakes. Its closing moments, the final note to its symphony of sacrifice and tragedy, leaves us with the single, delicate emotion that is hope, blooming in the darkness as our heroes set out to save Han and restore the Rebel Alliance. What A New Hope built up by making us fall in love with these characters, The Empire Strikes Back recouped in sharing with us their pain and their fears. Darth Vader\u2019s reveal that he\u2019s Luke\u2019s father has, of course, found its place in history, but there\u2019s an equal sense of emotional resonance in the moment Leia and Han depart, moments before he\u2019s trapped in carbonite. When Leia\u2019s \u201cI love you\u201d is returned by Han\u2019s \u201cI know\u201d \u2013 a line written by Harrison Ford himself \u2013 we\u2019re reminded of how magical Star Wars\u2019s sense of storytelling can be, condensing everything that these two characters feel for each other into five simple words.

The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977) Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. 2/30 29. Bambi (1942) Bambi isn\u2019t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it\u2019s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to \u201cApril Showers\u201d. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi\u2019s mother? Rex Features 3/30 28. Pocahontas (1995) Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney\u2019s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. Rex Features 4/30 27. The Aristocats (1971) The film may be relatively light on story (it\u2019s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there\u2019s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It\u2019s true what they say: \u201cEverybody wants to be a cat.\u201d Rex Features 5/30 26. Robin Hood (1973) In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It\u2019s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that\u2019s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book. Rex Features 6/30 25. Zootopia (2016) It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn\u2019t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it\u2019s as funny as you\u2019d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that\u2019s something that shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted. Rex Features 7/30 24. Dumbo (1941) Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There\u2019s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in \u201cBaby Mine\u201d (a scene that\u2019s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there\u2019s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary \u201cPink Elephants on Parade\u201d sequence. 8/30 23. Tangled (2010) Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what\u2019s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: \u201cI See the Light\u201d, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It\u2019s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. Rex Features 9/30 22. Princess and the Frog (2009) Disney\u2019s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There\u2019s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number \u201cAlmost There\u201d. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That\u2019s something to celebrate. Rex Features 10/30 21. Cinderella (1950) Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn\u2019t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There\u2019s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella\u2019s magical soiree. Rex Features 11/30 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961) Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there\u2019s still something irresistibly delightful about her \u201cPatsy from Ab Fab\u201d combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple \u201cHow are you?\u201d with the line: \"Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.\u201d Rex Features 12/30 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955) One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn\u2019t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous \u201cBella Notte\u201d scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime. Rex Features 13/30 18. Moana (2016) Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa'i helped create the soundtrack\u2019s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour \u2013 more of this in the future please, Disney. Rex Features 14/30 17. The Emperor's New Groove (2000) The Emperor\u2019s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo & Stitch, it\u2019s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor\u2019s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (\u201cPull the lever, Kronk!\u201d) Disney film that \u2013 most importantly \u2013 finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. Disney 15/30 16. Frozen (2013) It may be every modern parent\u2019s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you\u2019ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel\u2019s rendition of \u201cLet it Go\u201d is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. Rex Features 16/30 15. Peter Pan (1953) A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie\u2019s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and divorce don\u2019t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn\u2019t quite speak our language. 17/30 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) It\u2019s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There\u2019s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White\u2019s aid during \u201cWhistle While You Work\u201d, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: \u201cMagic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.\u201d Rex Features 18/30 13. Hercules (1997) A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy \u201cZero to Hero\u201d. That said, Megara\u2019s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her \u201cI\u2019m a damsel. I\u2019m in distress. I can handle this\u201d routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Rex Features 19/30 12. Mulan (1998) Let them deny it all they want, but you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn\u2019t secretly put \u201cI\u2019ll Make a Man Out of You\u201d on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan\u2019s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. Rex Features 20/30 11. The Jungle Book (1967) As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney\u2019s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into \u201cThe Bear Necessities\u201d, it feels very much like someone\u2019s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything\u2019s going to be alright. Rex Features 21/30 10. Aladdin (1992) Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams\u2019s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. Rex Features 22/30 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951) Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney\u2019s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn\u2019t get lost in Lewis Caroll\u2019s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn\u2019s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there\u2019s no denying its status as a cult classic now. Rex Features 23/30 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There\u2019s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption \u2013 take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it\u2019s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film\u2019s PG rating. Rex Features 24/30 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002) Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo & Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch\u2019s more unusual characteristics, and you\u2019ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It\u2019s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. Rex Features 25/30 6. Pinocchio (1940) This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting \u201cWhen You Wish Upon a Star\u201d \u2013 the song that best captures Walt Disney\u2019s dream \u2013 aside for a moment, let\u2019s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. \u201cBe virtuous or you\u2019ll be turned into a literal donkey,\u201d was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It\u2019s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney\u2019s early years. Rex Features 26/30 5. The Little Mermaid (1989) We\u2019re free to question Ariel\u2019s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel\u2019s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, \u201cUnder the Sea\u201d is such a party tune. Rex Features 27/30 4. Sleeping Beauty (1959) Sleeping Beauty is Disney\u2019s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flip", "description": "Disney has finally unveiled the full list of films and TV\u00a0shows that'll be available to watch on its brand new streaming service.", "authors": ["Jacob Stolworthy"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/18/12/disney-plus.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
