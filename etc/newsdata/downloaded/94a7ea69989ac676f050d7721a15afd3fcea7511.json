The leftist populist took responsibility on Friday for the government\u2019s decision to release the son of the notorious drug kingpin Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n after a military operation went off the rails Thursday, briefly turning the city of Culiac\u00e1n into a war zone.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fight fire with fire,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said at his Friday morning press conference. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference between our strategy versus what previous administrations have done. We don\u2019t want deaths, we don\u2019t want war. This is hard for many people to understand, but the strategy that was used by previous administrations turned the country into a cemetery, and we don\u2019t want that anymore.\u201d\n\nThat may be the administration\u2019s current argument, but it will do little to undo the public relations nightmare L\u00f3pez Obrador now finds himself in, after the shocking images from Culiac\u00e1n reverberated around social media in real time, stoking fear and confusion across the country.\n\nThe deadly shoot-out in Culiac\u00e1n bookends an especially deadly week in Mexico\u2019s drug war. On Monday, an ambush in western Mexico ended in the massacre of 13 officers by the Jalisco New Generation cartel. In a separate incident Wednesday, a gunfight between the military and suspected organized crime in the state of Guerrero left 15 people dead.\n\nThese incidents are red meat to L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s critics who argue the president\u2019s security strategy is faltering and that cartels are feeling emboldened. Security experts also said L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s decision to release Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n marked a striking breakdown in his security strategy that could strain relations with the U.S., which reportedly was seeking Guzman's extradition.\n\n\u201cThis is a clusterfuck,\u201d said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst in Mexico City. \u201cThere have been many mistakes in operations trying to capture kingpins. Most of them ended up with the escape of the kingpin. What had never happened \u2014 until now \u2014 was they actually capture the kingpin and then release him.\u201d\n\nThe shoot-out in Culiac\u00e1n has dominated Mexican media. Newspapers around the country splashed headlines that underscored the potential political fallout for L\u00f3pez Obrador, who until now has enjoyed approval ratings of around 70 percent. Among the headlines: \u201cChapito falls, unleashes terror, and then is released.\u201d \u201cTerror in Culiac\u00e1n after ephemeral capture of El Chapo\u2019s son.\u201d \u201cChapo\u2019s son is released, Culiac\u00e1n lives through hours of terror.\u201d\n\nThe high drama verged into the surreal by Friday afternoon, when lawyers for Guzman\u2019s family held a press conference to thank L\u00f3pez Obrador for releasing Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n.\n\nLopez Obrador is \u201ca good man, a Christian\u201d for releasing the younger Guzm\u00e1n, said Jos\u00e9 Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Meza, a lawyer for the Guzm\u00e1n family, at a press conference on Friday. A second lawyer for the family added that there had been no negotiation over his release.\n\n\u201cThe signal here is that the Mexican government is not going to put people behind bars at the cost of losing civilian lives\u201d\n\nSince taking office, L\u00f3pez Obrador has stated his disdain for the drug war that dominated Mexico for the last 13 years. \u201cAbrazos, no balazos\u201d \u2014 translated as \u201chugs, not gunfire\u201d \u2014 was one of his campaign slogans. Instead, he has emphasized addressing the root causes of violence, including extreme poverty. He has increased the minimum wage and emphasized rooting out corruption, strategies he has insisted will decrease violence in the long run. He also proposed legislation that would grant amnesty to low-level drug offenders.\n\n\n\nBut his approach doesn\u2019t appear to be working \u2014 at least not yet. Homicides are on track to surpass last year\u2019s 30,000 homicides, the most recorded in two decades of statistics. This week underscored the country\u2019s growing security problems.\n\n\n\nThe shoot-outs in Culiac\u00e1n were a gut-punch to an already delicate situation, said David Shirk, a professor at the University of San Diego who studies cartel violence in Mexico.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe signal here is that the Mexican government is not going to put people behind bars at the cost of losing civilian lives. And that may be very noble but it\u2019s problematic in that it suggests the government is amenable to extortion in the form of violence,\u201d said Shirk. \u201cWhat happens with the next person it wants to catch? The cartels could say we are going to start killing civilians every day until you release our guy.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat exactly happened on Thursday remains unclear. At first Mexican security secretary Alfonso Durazo released a video saying that 30 soldiers from the army and National Guard were patrolling Culiac\u00e1n when someone shot at them from inside a house. The soldiers found Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n inside the house, but they ended up letting him go after being surrounded by gunmen with more force, Durazo said. The Wall Street Journal reported that Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n was released after top Mexican officials learned that at least six soldiers were being held by gunmen Thursday afternoon.\n\n\n\nLuis Cresencio Sandoval, the head of Mexico\u2019s army, offered a different version of events Friday, telling reporters that it was a planned operation. He said local police were executing an arrest warrant with \u201cextradition purposes.\u201d He said the operation was planned without approval from the country\u2019s top officials and bungled by the local police forces who carried it out. He said eight people died in gun fights across the city, including five cartel members, a civilian, and one member of the National Guard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only that you failed but that everyone watched.\u201d\n\nBut Sandoval struck a defensive tone and criticized reporters for focusing on the decision to release Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n. \u201cWe have to develop operations. And sometimes, errors are made. On many occasions, such errors have been paid for with the lives of our personnel. And you guys don\u2019t complain about what happened. Our personnel put our lives at risk for you, for all citizens.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration declined to comment, and forwarded queries to the Mexican government. But L\u00f3pez Obrador confirmed at his press conference that the operation was carried out to fulfill the extradition request.\n\nEduardo Guerrero, a security analyst at Lantia Consultores in Mexico City, said the obfuscation over what happened suggests the Mexican government is trying to find a way out to save face. \u201cThese kinds of contradictions happen when you don\u2019t want to say something clear for fear of appearing ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cThis defeat is going to be very costly for L\u00f3pez Obrador and will probably result in the resignation of his security secretary.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not so unusual for operations like this to go wrong, said Jaime L\u00f3pez-Aranda, a security analyst in Mexico City. \u201cIt\u2019s just that it had never gone wrong in real-time being broadcast over Twitter and WhatsApp and everything else,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only that you failed but that everyone watched.\u201d\n\nCover: President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador arrives in Oaxaca as part of his tour.
