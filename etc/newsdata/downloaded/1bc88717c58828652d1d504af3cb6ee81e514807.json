The agency says it\u2019s investigating the illness alongside 16 states where the cases were reported from June 28th to August 20th.\n\nThe illness seems to start out gradually with symptoms that include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, and / or chest pain. Some cases also involve mild to moderate gastrointestinal illness, including vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. No one has died of the still-unnamed illness. The CDC and impacted states haven\u2019t identified a cause, but in all reported cases, affected people had used vapes. In multiple cases, these people also said they had recently used tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products. THC is found in marijuana, so it could be possible that people are vaping weed products.\n\nThe CDC has ruled out an infectious disease as the cause, but are still working to narrow down the possible cause and verify the cases. The agency is asking doctors to report any suspected cases to their state health office, along with details of their patient\u2019s symptoms, information about what kind of e-cigarette they were using, and what they might have been vaping before symptoms set in. The Food and Drug Administration is also investigating faulty e-cigarettes and is asking the public to report any \u201cadverse experiences\u201d online.\n\nThe CDC says most cases involve adolescents and young adults, which isn\u2019t necessarily a surprise given that the US Surgeon General declared youth vaping an epidemic in December this past year. Vaping among high schoolers increased by 78 percent between 2017 and 2018, with more than 27 percent of high schoolers using e-cigarettes regularly.", "description": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating a mysterious lung disease that has now affected 153 people.
