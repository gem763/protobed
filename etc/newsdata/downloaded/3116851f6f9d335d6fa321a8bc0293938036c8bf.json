It was plonked without fanfare on to the old wooden table in front of me. The wine was decanted from a battered carafe by a French hiker who had just woken up. But I wolfed the pasta down before you could say \u201cindependent principality\u201d, and did the same with the second helping. I bear no shame in saying it was a meal fit for the gods.\n\nThe food was, aptly enough, delivered from above. Andorra\u2019s four refugis guardats \u2013 staffed mountain refuges, each with around 50 dorm beds \u2013 are remote enough to require helicopter supplies. Everything from tinned peaches to wine is choppered in a couple of times a season.\n\nI was tackling the circular Coronallacs Trail, a new, furiously undulating 58-mile walking route, devised to link Andorra\u2019s only four manned refuges and be the first long-distance loop that stays within its borders. All five stages involve between six and 10 hours of walking a day. To say I was working up an appetite would be fair.\n\nThe landlocked, Catalan-speaking nation is a 180-square-mile pouch of the Pyrenees, with an average elevation of 1,996 metres, sandwiched between France and Spain. Say Andorra and people think skiing and tax-free shopping. But there\u2019s more. As well as winter-sports crowds, the mountains and valleys also attract summer hikers.\n\nThe landscape is fortress-like, full of craggy cols and high-perched lakes. Looked at on an altitude chart, the Coronallacs trail resembles a hospital pulse monitor. Possibly mine. We\u2019d been walking for perhaps a minute when my guide, Spaska, told me she\u2019d attempted the trail once before in a group of nine, finishing with only six. \u201cOne got too tired, one sprained an ankle, one fell over,\u201d she told me, smiling. The route involves 6,858 metres of ascent, the equivalent of climbing Aconcagua, the highest peak in the Andes, from sea level. You carry your own bag throughout. Two pieces of advice: book refuges ahead and bring good boots.\n\nThe circuit begins and ends at Escaldes-Engordany, above the capital Andorra la Vella. Our first day was one long climb, an uphill through pine woods of fern fronds, hopping blackbirds and blue butterflies no bigger than a thumbnail. Above the treeline we found temperatures pushing 30C and a confetti of wildflowers. Snow-pocked peaks peered down on us.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In summer, the mountainsides are covered in wildflowers.

It gets tough, the wilderness. I had a shower (limited to one minute \u2013 but what a minute) and rested. \u201cThese mountain paths are hundreds of years old,\u201d said one of the refuge staff. \u201cOur ancestors have kept animals up here for centuries. Goats, sheep, cattle, horses. You\u2019re walking in the herders\u2019 footsteps.\u201d\n\nBy morning a dozen fudge-coloured horses had appeared in the grassy bowl of land next to the refuge. The themes of the first day \u2013 sweaty ascents, rangy scenery, nature at play \u2013 continued over the following stages. Up, down, water, up, down, energy bar. Waterfalls tumbled from cliffs. Vultures swept overhead.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Our ancestors have kept animals up here for centuries. Goats, sheep, cattle, horses. You\u2019re walking in the herders\u2019 footsteps.\u2019\n\nI was expecting the other hikers I\u2019d meet would be walking the same route. Nope. All four refuges stand on a crossroads of other long-distance Pyrenean trails. People straggled over high passes from all compass points, tiny stick figures astir in the uplands.\n\nThe days were long. Spaska stayed for the first two, reeling off Latin plant names and generally bringing the hills to life, then had to descend, setting me loose in the high pastures for the last three. I yomped across ridges and zigzagged up summits, my calves burning. The panoramas were green-grey, savage and relentlessly big. No other refuge was as box-fresh as Illa \u2013 and quite right too, traditionalists would probably argue \u2013 but all arrived as promised lands. The second, Jucl\u00e0, had a hippyish vibe and a hammock (and that great cheesy pasta). The third, Borda de Sorteny, had vichyssoise soup and wifi. I reached Comapedrosa, the fourth, just before a thunderstorm did, done in and dog-tired. It had wine. I remember that much.\n\nEvery day the route rose and plunged, swirling around tight contour-bends. A mixture of my own stupidity and some gnomic signage meant I had to backtrack at least three times. The trail crossed ski pistes, where chairlifts hung static above orchid-strewn slopes, then climbed again to higher ground. \u201cWe need the mountains,\u201d a local hiker told me one evening. \u201cFor Andorrans, the Pyrenees is our gym.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Refugi del Comapedrosa, the fourth and final refuge on this route.

Septuagenarians crossing from France to Spain. As the sun was setting over the blue ridges and the cook was catering for the ravenous, maps and conversation would unfold over the dinner table. I\u2019ll skirt over the snoring.\n\nDay five was a lengthy descent back to town, with its crisp bedsheets, supermarkets and unrationed hot water. It took about an hour before I wished I was back on the trail. This little pocket of the Pyrenees may be half the size of London \u2013 but it packs a mighty punch.\n\n\u2022 The trip was provided by Visit Andorra (visitandorra.com).
