We closed most of our distilleries in Quebec.\"\n\nAccording to the report, Windsor-Essex has the highest number of distilling-related jobs in Ontario.\n\nWhile Westcott admits that his members export a majority of their products, he insists that a strong home market is key to sustaining distilleries, with Ontario sales currently supporting 30 per cent of production.\n\n\"There are no businesses that survive strictly as exporters on the consumer product side,\" he said. \"Nobody survives strictly on exports.\"\n\nWestcott spoke with Afternoon Drive host Chris dela Torre about the report.

We spoke to Jan Westcott, president of Spirits Canada. 6:11\n\nThe Spirits Canada CEO said he's hopeful the province will listen to what his group is saying, noting that he has been having \"robust discussions\" with the government.\n\n\"The thing got kind of off on the wrong foot originally with [Ontario Premier Doug Ford] talking about beer and wine in corner stores,\" he said. \"The premier doesn't even drink, so, did he really just mean beer and wine?\"\n\n\"What we're trying to do is say 'Guys, it has to be everybody. Why would you treat products that are made in Ontario by Ontario workers less fairly than you treat products from other countries or the other categories?'\"", "description": "Ontario's distilleries say jobs and government revenue will be at risk if spirits aren't given the same access to corner and grocery stores as beer and wine.", "authors": ["Jonathan Pinto Is A Reporter Editor At Cbc Windsor", "Primarily Assigned To Afternoon Drive", "Cbc Radio'S Regional Afternoon Show For Southwestern Ontario.
