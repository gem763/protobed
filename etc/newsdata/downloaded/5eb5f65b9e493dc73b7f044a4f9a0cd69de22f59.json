Senate Republicans want $5 billion to go to the wall's construction.\n\n\"We\u2019re at an impasse,\" one Democratic staffer said.\n\nA short-term spending bill into early 2020 is the likeliest fix.\n\nThe question is whether Trump will accept that.\n\nHouse Democrats are ready to offer up a clean, short-term spending bill on the Nov. 21 deadline \u2014 and Trump could view that as a dare to shut down the government.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate is moving forward to try to pass funding bills for parts of the government not involved in the border wall.\n\nA senior GOP Senate aide told Axios that Democrats are the only ones talking about the shutdown, and that \u201cit\u2019s no joke that Dems can\u2019t walk and chew gum at the same time while they obsess over impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe big picture: Last year's prolonged government shutdown over the border wall backfired politically against President Trump and Republicans. Republicans have \"zero appetite\" to do it again, one Senate GOP aid told Axios. But time is ticking. Congress is up against the holidays, priorities including the USMCA and an impeachment proceeding that may eventually shut down the Senate.\n\nIn private, Cuellar said, his Republican colleagues have expressed fatigue over the border wall issue. \"They wish we could just do the appropriation bills and just move on,\" he said, but, \"they\u2019re not going to do that publicly.\"\n\nWhat to watch: Funding deadlines in the House and Senate coinciding with the impeachment process could cause logistical problems.", "description": "Democrats are voicing concerns that Trump may hijack the spending process.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/nXnQu3ZcR8oYuOqMXvVaLFG3qKU=/0x337:4500x2868/1920x1080/2019/10/30/1572400265505.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
