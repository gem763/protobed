He was part of the zoo since 2006.\n\nZoo officials last week said the bear two months ago had become lethargic and was refusing to eat. Caretakers removed him from his usual habitat for monitoring.\n\nAfter the bear died, an evaluation found a mass around and in one of his kidneys. Zoo officials say the condition often goes undetected in animals that large. A more comprehensive pathology review is planned.\n\nPolar Bears International says some polar bears in captivity have lived to their mid- to late 30s.\n\nThe death was first reported by KTUU-television.", "description": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - A polar bear at the Alaska Zoo has died.Officials announced on the zoo website Monday that 19-year-old Lyutyik (LOO-tee-ik) died...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
