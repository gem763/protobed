Sathya Narayanan\n\nSept 5 (Reuters) - Gold retreated on Thursday as investors booked profits after the metal rallied to a six-year peak in the previous session and hopes of a thaw in U.S.-China trade ties spurred demand for riskier assets.\n\nSpot gold fell 0.7% to $1,541.20 per ounce as of 0957 GMT, having scaled $1,557 on Wednesday, its highest since April 2013.\n\nU.S. GCcv1 dropped 0.7% to $1,549.70 per ounce.\n\n\"The fact that they (U.S. and China) have agreed to restart talks probably has taken a little bit of steam off gold. We saw gold touching a high at $1,557, so it bounced down slightly; could just be an element of profit taking,\" said Philip Newman, a director at Metals Focus.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry said its trade team will hold talks with U.S. counterparts in mid-September in preparation for high-level negotiations in early October, while the ministry spokesman said Beijing opposes any escalation in the trade war. shares rose to a one-month high, with further support coming from a decision by British lawmakers to vote against a no-deal Brexit and the withdrawal of an extradition bill that had triggered months of protests in Hong Kong.
