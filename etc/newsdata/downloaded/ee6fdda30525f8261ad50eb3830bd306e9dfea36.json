The full report can be downloaded here.\n\nThe Fed cut rates a quarter point on July 31, 2019. Such cuts have sometimes increased investors' risk appetite, but that didn't happen in August. Investors pulled a combined $15.9 billion from long-term open-end and exchange-traded funds for the month. Every major U.S. category group\u2014except commodities\u2014saw a decline in inflows or an increase in outflows compared with July. August's long-term outflows were the greatest since December 2018, when capital markets were enduring a nasty correction.\n\nMoney market funds were a likely beneficiary of August's long-term outflows with $80 billion in inflows, even though the Fed's rate cut will reduce the yield on such funds. This perhaps speaks to the level of investor trepidation. Nevertheless, August saw the group's second-greatest inflows in 2019. Money market funds have now collected $298.3 billion for the year to date, the greatest sum since 2008 when investors were in the depths of the credit crisis.\n\nPassive U.S. equity assets passed active U.S. equity assets by about $25 billion. As a result, passive share of U.S. equity open-end and ETF assets is now 50.15% versus 49.85% for active funds.\n\nThis milestone has been a long time coming as the trend toward low-cost fund investing has gained momentum. Active U.S. equity funds have had outflows every year since 2006, with roughly equivalent inflows into passive funds during that time. Over the past 10 years, active U.S. equity funds have had $1.3 trillion in outflows and their passive counterparts nearly $1.4 trillion in inflows.\n\nOther key takeaways:\n\nTaxable-bond funds led the way with $16.3 billion in inflows, but this was the group's second-lowest total of the year. Credit-oriented high-yield and bank-loan funds had about $8.9 billion in combined outflows. Municipal-bond funds' inflows remained strong with $9.1 billion.", "description": "Long-term funds suffered $16 billion in outflows during August.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt39748fbb4cfe7399/5c76ba14205569d260b09343/KevinMcDevitt_1x1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
