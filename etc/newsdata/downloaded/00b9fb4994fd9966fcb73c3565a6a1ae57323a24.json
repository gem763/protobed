Those nations, more accustomed to administrations that sacrifice U.S. national security in return for the ability to portray a rosy but false picture of global relations, would like nothing more than to see him lose the next election. They can be expected to do all they can to achieve that goal.\n\nRussia will continue its drive to stay ahead of the U.S. in nuclear arms, a position it achieved thanks to negotiations with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in the New Start talks.\n\nNorth Korea will veer away from compromising on its nuclear program any further in the hope of a getting a new occupant in the White House who will be less militant on sanctions and less willing to fund a U.S. military that will be sufficiently capable of a kinetic solution.\n\nIran and the terrorists it sponsors had the benefit of eight years of the Obama presidency which, bizarrely and still inexplicably, did all that it could to strengthen and enrich the Mullah-led, deeply anti-U.S. and anti-Israel regime. After suffering through Trump\u2019s stringent sanctions, it will vigorously do everything possible to get another Democrat back in office.\n\nChina will do all that it can to increase tensions in Asia and the Pacific.\n\nMore importantly, from a domestic American perspective, it will refuse to compromise in trade talks, and will engage in actions that cause pain to U.S. consumers, farmers, and others. This is a particularly frustrating problem for Washington. Beijing\u2019s outrageous practices of intellectual property theft, technological espionage, marketplace dumping, and barriers to U.S. goods seriously damage America\u2019s economy.\n\nIf the issue was appropriately settled, the American economy and in particular U.S. blue collar workers would gain tremendously. The problem can be resolved if Washington takes firm action such as the Trump Administration\u2019s tariffs, because China needs America far more than America needs China.\n\nBut the temporary pain this may cause In the U.S. will be seized upon by Democrats and their media allies as a reason to vote against the GOP. The internal fight will be particularly tough. Far more than Moscow ever did, Beijing has mastered internal U.S. politics.\n\nA Foreign Affairs review noted that,\n\n\u201cIn the last decade, the Chinese government has committed to boosting its appeal abroad. Beijing has been developing an international media network and establishing cultural study centers around the world. While debate abounds over whether promoting China\u2019s traditions, values, language, and culture can win it more friends, vast funds are backing programs to enhance the country\u2019s image.\u201d\n\nA Diplomat article notes that,\n\n\u201cIn 2014, President Xi Jinping said, \u2019We should increase China\u2019s soft power, give a good Chinese narrative, and better communicate China\u2019s message to the world.\u2019 One of Xi\u2019s signature policies, the \u2018Chinese Dream,\u2019 has been proposed as a kind of corollary or alternative to the American Dream. This is all part of a \u2018charm offensive\u2019 that will only accelerate in years to come, especially in light of the events at the recent 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.\u201d\n\nBeijing built great sway on university campuses through its \u201cConfucius Institutes\u201d in Hollywood, through its purchases of media companies, and in both parties through quiet deals which enrich individual politicians. Joe Biden\u2019s vigorous attempts to downplay China\u2019s danger following his son\u2019s billion dollar deal with that nation is a prime example.\n\nMoscow, Beijing, Tehran, and Pyongyang clearly understand that any of the candidates currently seeking the Democrat nomination to oppose Trump would return to the Obama Administration\u2019s practice of sharply cutting the Pentagon\u2019s budget, an outcome they are only too eager to have occur.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a bumpy ride until November of 2020.\n\nFrank Vernuccio serves as editor-in-chief of the New York Analysis of Policy & Government.", "description": "President Trump has had a tough and realistic set of .09/06/2019 8:06:49AM EST.", "authors": ["Frank Vernuccio", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/221/3b20d16a-f665-407c-ae28-9a34ef0f6376.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
