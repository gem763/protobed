But it was really just shaming.\u201d\n\nAfter sharing the underwear photo in 2009, the 41-year-old actor said at the time that his then-wife was wearing a bikini, not underwear, and that they had been at the beach together.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It was a bikini, not underwear, so people might have been confused. She was ironing my pants. That sounds weird, but we were on a beach and she was wearing a bikini, ironing my pants!\u201d\n\nThe actor also said that \u201cI took a picture of her and asked her before I put it out to the world\u201d.\n\nIn the book, Moore also describes the couple\u2019s other marriage troubles, including Kutcher\u2019s cheating, which the actress said she believes stems from their decision to have threesomes.\n\n\u201cI put him first,\u201d Moore says in the book. \u201cSo when he expressed his fantasy of bringing a third person into our bed, I didn\u2019t say no. I wanted to show him how great and fun I could be.\u201d\n\nSeemingly in reaction to the claims in the book, Kutcher responded on Twitter, writing: \u201cI was about to push the button on a really snarky tweet. Then I saw my son, daughter, and wife and I deleted it.\u201d\n\nThe actor then quoted his father in a follow-up tweet, writing: \u201cLife is good - Larry Kutcher.\u201d\n\nThe couple announced their separation in November 2011. However, according to Moore, she is also grateful for her ex-husband.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to Ashton, too, believe it or not,\u201d she wrote in the book. \u201cWhatever pain we went through together enabled both of us to grow into the people we are today.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Moore also said she spoke to Ashton before the book came out and that she has no interest in \u201cblaming or villainizing anyone\u201d.", "description": "Demi Moore has criticised her ex-husband Ashton Kutcher for \u201cshaming\u201d her\u00a0by sharing drunk photos of her during their marriage, including one\u00a0in her underwear.
