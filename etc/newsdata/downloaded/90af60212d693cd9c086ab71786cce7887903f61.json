The Kurds also are putting out feelers to Russia for support against an onslaught by Turkish troops and Turkish-supported militias.\n\nA return of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces to northeastern Syria for the first time in seven years would make visible the end to the bitter, controversial U.S. mission there against the so-called Islamic State. That\u2019s not because of any concerted decision to withdraw by President Trump, whose antiwar rhetoric obscured his vacillation about leaving. It\u2019s because Assad will deny his American adversary the room to operate that the Syrian Kurds had provided their deceitful American partners.\n\n\u201cWe know that we would have to make painful compromises with Moscow and Bashar al-Assad if we go down the road of working with them,\u201d the Kurdish commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) wrote in an op-ed published Sunday in Foreign Policy. \u201cBut if we have to choose between compromises and the genocide of our people, we will surely choose life for our people.\u201d\n\nMore in sorrow than in anger, the commander, Mazloum Abdi, wrote, \u201cWhen the whole world failed to support us, the United States extended its hands. We shook hands and appreciated its generous support.\u201d\n\nBut under Turkish pressure, at Washington\u2019s request, the Kurds \u201cagreed to withdraw our heavy weapons from the border area with Turkey, destroy our defensive fortifications, and pull back our most seasoned fighters. Turkey would never attack us so long as the U.S. government was true to its word with us.\u201d\n\nOr so they believed.\n\n\u201cWe are now standing with our chests bare to face the Turkish knives,\u201d Mazloum wrote.\n\nBrett McGurk, who resigned as the presidential special envoy to the coalition against ISIS last December, told The Daily Beast on Sunday that such a move by the Syrian Kurds was predictable under the circumstances.\n\nEven last year, when McGurk was still serving, Kurdish leaders in Syria were telling the Americans that if support for them and deterrence against a Turkish attack was not going to continue, they needed to make a deal with the Assad regime and Russia for protection. \u201cWe have given our road map to the Russians. We are just waiting on a decision,\u201d one senior Kurdish official told The Washington Post.\n\nMcGurk said he supported that idea at a time when Trump already was talking about pulling out of Syria, but he met firm opposition within the administration. (Special Representative for Syria Engagement Jim Jeffrey, for one, \u201ctold the Kurds on multiple occasions, \u2018we\u2019ll manage Turkey, don\u2019t make a deal with the [Assad] regime,\u2019\u201d according to a source familiar with the matter.) Then-National Security Adviser John Bolton and crew insisted the U.S. must stay in Syria until Iran was out, or at least on its way. (Representatives for Bolton, whom Trump fired last month, did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Neither did State Department spokespeople.)\n\nSince McGurk\u2019s resignation, he has stayed in touch with the members of the SDF and some contacts in the U.S. departments of state and defense. He says the Kurds asked repeatedly if the support and protection of the United States could be relied upon, and they were told repeatedly that the Americans had their backs.\n\nBut that was not the case.\n\nMcGurk told the Beirut Institute Summit in Abu Dhabi that when the Russians first got heavily involved in Syria in 2016, an oft repeated truism about Kremlin duplicity was \u201cEverybody knows not to get into a well with a Russian rope.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut now what I hear,\u201d McGurk told the audience, \u201cis that nobody should get into a well with an American rope.\u201d\n\nIn other words, once it became clear in 2018 that Trump was hostile to the open-ended U.S. presence in Syria he inherited, the Kurds had options to help ease the end of their relationship with the Americans. But Trump\u2019s State Department and Pentagon, unwilling to face up to a final withdrawal\u2014and the unequivocal loss of U.S. influence in a part of the Middle East where it is increasingly impotent, if not irrelevant\u2014convinced the Kurds not to plan for an American departure. Had the Kurds done so, their new Russian and Syrian partners might have been able to spare them the devastation that Turkey is now wreaking as the U.S. pulls back and stands by.", "description": "Ismail Coskun/APABU DHABI\u2014Abandoned by the Americans, their former allies, Syria\u2019s Kurds reportedly are allowing troops from the Assad regime to enter territory they had under their control.
