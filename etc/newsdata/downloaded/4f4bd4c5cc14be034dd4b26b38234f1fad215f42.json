While the senator hails from California, one of the nation\u2019s largest states and one that has long served as a cash cow for Democrats, she is struggling to raise funds.\n\n\u201cIn a field of 18 candidates, we face an in\u00adcred\u00adibly competitive resource environment,\u201d Harris campaign manager Juan Rodriguez wrote in a memo. \u201cTo effectively compete with the top campaigns and make the necessary investments in the critical final 100 days to the [Iowa] caucus, we need to reduce expenditures elsewhere and realign resources.\u201d\n\nRodriguez wrote that he was taking a pay cut and that the staff of the Baltimore-based campaign headquarters would be reduced. In the coming weeks, he added, field staffers would be moved out of New Hampshire, Nevada and California and relocated to Iowa. The operation in South Carolina, another early primary state, would not be affected, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe memo, which was first reported by Politico and provided to The Washington Post by the campaign, said the cutbacks were needed to mount a seven-figure ad buy in Iowa.\n\nRodriguez compared the moves to those made by Democrat John F. Kerry in 2004 and Republican John McCain in 2008, when they pared down their campaigns in the fall before mounting comebacks in the winter. Both won their parties\u2019 nominations but lost the general election.\n\nBut this is an undeniable comedown for a Harris campaign that launched in front of nearly 20,000 supporters in Oakland, Calif., still one of the largest gatherings of the campaign. Harris seized more attention during the first debate, when she attacked Biden in personal terms for his long-standing opposition to court-mandated busing programs designed to integrate schools.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeveral recent surveys in Iowa showed Harris at 3 percent, after registering 14 percent at the start of September in the RealClearPolitics average.\n\nThe senator held private fundraisers during the third quarter of the year, but she drew roughly the same amount of money as she had the previous quarter \u2014 about $11.8 million. She spent more money than she raised in the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, and entered the final three months of the year with far less cash than the top fundraising candidates.\n\nHarris\u2019s reorganization comes as Biden, who still leads in many primary polls but by diminishing amounts, gets some financial reinforcement.\n\nAllies of the former vice president announced Wednesday that they were forming a super PAC called Unite the Country, which will be able to accept unlimited contributions to aid Biden\u2019s effort but be legally prohibited from coordinating directly with his campaign.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was just a few days ago that Biden dropped his long-standing opposition to having a super PAC created to support him. In a Democratic Party increasingly skeptical of rich and powerful figures, Biden\u2019s change has prompted other candidates to accuse him of hypocrisy.\n\nOrganizers of the super PAC, including several former Biden staffers and aides, say the goal is to help him fend off attacks from President Trump, who has aimed much of his fire at the former vice president. They have not addressed how much of their goal will also be to help him win the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to fighting back against Trump, his allies, the Russians, and the Republican Party \u2014 all of whom are engaged in unprecedented attacks against Vice President Biden in order to deny him the Democratic nomination,\u201d Mark Doyle, the chairman of the super PAC and a former Biden aide, said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOthers leading the PAC include John MacNeil, former president of Moody Street Pictures, who was Biden\u2019s videographer during his 2008 presidential campaign; Larry Rasky, a political strategist who held senior roles in Biden\u2019s 1988 and 2008 campaigns; Mark Riddle, executive director of Future Majority; and Mich\u00e8le Taylor, who has served as a strategist on national and federal campaigns.\n\nHarris and Biden are not alone in facing money troubles. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have tapped into extensive networks of small-dollar donors, and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has also raised significant sums, but other candidates have struggled to bring in cash.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), for example, was among the lowest fundraisers in the third quarter, drawing $4.8 million while spending nearly $8 million. She entered the fourth quarter with about $3.6 million in the bank.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFormer housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro has been peppering supporters with fundraising appeals recently, after publicly announcing he would drop out of the race if he failed to raise $800,000 by the end of October.\n\nMontana Gov. Steve Bullock and Sen. Michael F. Bennet of Colorado both entered the fourth quarter with less than $2 million on hand. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey used a 10-day fundraising push at the end of the third quarter to stay in the race, but it is unclear whether he can keep up that momentum.\n\nFormer Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, has adopted an un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox approach to raise money. In late September, members of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign staff were pitted against one another to see who could personally raise the most money for him.\n\nAD\n\nA New Hampshire-based O\u2019Rourke organizer promised donors that if he won the staff competition, he would create a \u201cchoreographed video\u201d featuring a massive \u201cBeto\u201d sign. Another staffer offered to do whatever donors wanted him to, including growing a beard.\n\nAD\n\nSenior adviser Abe Rakov offered something of perhaps greater value, saying that one of his donors would receive a recorded voice mail greeting from O\u2019Rourke himself.\n\nHarris\u2019s campaign, however, said she would not engage in such tactics.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning of this campaign, Kamala D. Harris and this team set out with one goal \u2014 to win the nomination and defeat Donald Trump in 2020,\u201d Rodriguez wrote in the campaign memo. \u201cThis requires us to make difficult strategic decisions and make clear priorities, not threaten to drop out or deploy gimmicks.\u201d\n\nJenna Johnson contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Kamala D.
