Thunberg, 16, is currently in California.\n\nBut Sofia and Isabella Axelsson quoted Thunberg as saying that \"what we need is for our rulers and politicians to listen to the research.\"\n\nThe Nordic Council hands out annual prizes for literature, youth literature, film, music and the environment, each worth 350,000 Danish kroner ($52,000).\n\nIt was not the first prize that the climate activist has won or been nominated for.\n\nThree Norwegian lawmakers nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize this year because they believe \"the massive movement Greta has set in motion is a very important peace contribution.\"\n\nLast year, about three months into her school climate strike campaign, Thunberg declined another award \u2014 the Children's Climate Prize, which is awarded by a Swedish electricity company \u2014 because many of the finalists had to fly to Stockholm for the ceremony.\n\nThunberg notes that flights contribute to global warming, so she sailed across the Atlantic Ocean for two weeks on a zero-emissions sailboat to reach New York. There the Swede scolded a U.N. climate conference in September, repeatedly asking, \"How dare you?\"\n\n\"We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and yet all you can talk about is money. You are failing us,\" she said.\n\nWeeks later, Thunberg won the 2019 Right Livelihood Award \u2014 known as the \"Alternative Nobel\" \u2014 \"for inspiring and amplifying political demands for urgent climate action reflecting scientific facts.\"\n\nIn May 2019, she was featured on the cover of Time magazine, which named her a \"next generation leader.\"", "description": "\"What we need is for our rulers and politicians to listen to the research,\" said the 16-year-old who has inspired millions around the globe to protest for climate action.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4269660/1000x563_nbc-191030-greta_thunberg-mc-1048_e0c82a980e223507bf797d88ef62074c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
