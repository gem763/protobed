President Trump tweeted a warning, declaring, \u201cIf Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!).\u201d This reassured no one and sowed more confusion. Pentagon statements did not seem to jibe with other administration statements.\n\nThe concerns about the policy move are straightforward. The Kurds in Syria bore the brunt of the fighting that drove the Islamic State out of its self-proclaimed caliphate. Our NATO ally Turkey does not like this at all, given the ties between the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) forces in Kurdish Syria and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) element in Turkey. If the United States withdraws its troops, it\u2019s an implicit green light for Turkey to move into Syria and eliminate the Kurdish threat. Except that the Kurds also hold thousands of Islamic State fighters in captivity, and who knows what happens if the YPG is under attack.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe oddest aspect of all of this is that it seemed unnecessary. Morgan\u2019s Politico story suggests that alternative arrangements had been worked out between the U.S. and Turkish militaries. Little wonder that a National Security Council official told Newsweek\u2019s James Laporta that Trump got \u201crolled\u201d by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nIn other words, for the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy, it was a day ending with a \u201cY.\u201d\n\nThis reminds me of an exchange I had this year with a prominent realist scholar who shall remain nameless. I asked this person why they weren\u2019t happier with the Trump administration, since the president seemed to be pursuing or talking up goals that realists like: forcing allies to do more, disentangling from the Middle East, pursuing a mercantilist trade policy, etc. This prominent realist then went on a rant about how Trump was doing everything incompetently and therefore was not really a realist.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven realists who support Trump\u2019s moves in the abstract acknowledge the inelegance of what is being done in practice:\n\n1) as someone who doesn\u2019t like whining about process, the Syria decision looks like a trash process;\n\n2) as someone who favors withdrawal from Syria, that did not require blindsiding YPG/SDF, which it appears we have;\n\n3) are US forces leaving Syria entirely? Where are they going? \u2014 Justin Logan (@JustinTLogan) October 7, 2019\n\nAs awful as it is to witness all of this, I do confess to a small dollop of schadenfreude at watching some realists squirm at Trump\u2019s blunders. Because this is how the sausage is made. Each foreign policy tribe has had a leader sympathetic to its worldview come into office in this century. And each tribe has seen its Platonic ideal of foreign policy come to ruin in its execution.\n\nNeoconservatives supported the invasion of Iraq, but I am old enough to remember that they were not thrilled with the way George W. Bush did it. For most of them, the invasion force was too light and the post-invasion force was way too light for their tastes. Nonetheless, they had to defend a radically imperfect policy implementation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSimilarly, liberal internationalists supported the Obama approach to foreign policy, but there were areas where the administration\u2019s execution left something to be desired. Barack Obama was ambivalent at best about intervening in Libya and Syria. His team did not handle China\u2019s rollout of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank terribly well. Nonetheless, they had to defend a radically imperfect policy implementation.\n\nTrump is the closest realists will get to a president whose first principles mirror their own. He has bungled a lot of things. They might believe it is unfair that Trump is not executing a realist policy in the way that they would do it if they were in charge. But the mandarin is never in charge. The question is whether the imperfect version of their preferred policy is still worth supporting.\n\nTo their credit, some realist intellectuals realize this:\n\nSo as not to seem evasive, and to anticipate a challenge from @thomaswright08, FWIW I think the US should pull out of Syria and indeed the Middle East generally. This will forseeably result in some violent disorder, some of it horrific. Necessary retrenchment is rarely clean 1/ \u2014 Patrick Porter (@PatPorter76) October 7, 2019\n\nMost do not, however. And after decades of hearing realists proclaim that they could do everything better, it is not the worst outcome for them to learn that all policy implementation is hard.\n\nAD", "description": "Trump demonstrates that no foreign policy is executed the way its backers want.", "authors": ["Daniel W.
