But a new subpoena for Trump\u2019s tax returns filed by Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance could break that cycle: Late in August, as part of a criminal investigation into the Trump Organization\u2019s $130,000 hush payment to Stormy Daniels, the DA reportedly subpoenaed the president\u2019s accounting firm, Mazars USA, for the president\u2019s personal and corporate tax returns on the federal and state level going back to 2011. Unlike previous subpoenas, this one is in the context of a criminal investigation with a sitting grand jury, making it more difficult for the president\u2019s lawyers to dodge this filing with a lawsuit.\n\nOf particular importance in the DA investigation \u2014 and a detail that could be confirmed by observing Trump\u2019s tax sheets \u2014 is whether or not Trump or his company filed the Daniels payoff in 2016 as a legal expense. Falsifying business records is illegal in the state of New York. As CNN legal analyst Elie Honig notes, that might not be a big deal as far as Trump\u2019s baseline criminality goes \u2014 unless the falsification is in order to obscure another crime.\n\nIt's coming into focus: seems the Manhattan DA is trying to lock down a case for falsifying business records -- usually a misdemeanor but, if tied to another crime (here, tax fraud), it becomes a felony. https://t.co/43Tp5bIOBo \u2014 Elie Honig (@eliehonig) September 16, 2019\n\nIn September, Mother Jones reported on a potential instance in which the president may have committed tax fraud: On personal financial disclosure forms filed each year, Trump claims he owes $50 million to a company, Chicago Unit Acquisition, that he owns. It\u2019s possible that Trump is moving money around in this fashion to avoid paying taxes on the sum, a deal that could be proven to be \u201cgarden-variety fraud,\u201d according to Georgetown law professor Adam Levitin. Then there\u2019s the instance of what the New York Times called \u201covert fraud\u201d by Trump in the 1990s, regarding a company owned by the family called All County Building Supply & Maintenance:\n\nAll County\u2019s ostensible purpose was to be the purchasing agent for Fred Trump\u2019s buildings, buying everything from boilers to cleaning supplies. It did no such thing, records and interviews show. Instead All County siphoned millions of dollars from Fred Trump\u2019s empire by simply marking up purchases already made by his employees. Those millions, effectively untaxed gifts, then flowed to All County\u2019s owners \u2014 Donald Trump, his siblings and a cousin. Fred Trump then used the padded All County receipts to justify bigger rent increases for thousands of tenants.\n\nUnfortunately for a public eager to see the president\u2019s taxes, his returns would remain private throughout the investigation \u2014 unless the filings were used as evidence in a criminal case against Trump or his company. But past glimpses into Trump\u2019s taxes have been revelatory in showing how the president failed to live up to his gold-plated image: A report from May proved that Trump lost a staggering $1.17 billion of (mostly) other people\u2019s money between 1985 and 1994, while a New York Times investigation from October 2018 proved that Trump, for years, needed healthy cash injections from his father in order to keep his businesses afloat, totaling $413 million. Many of those gifts to Trump were in order to help his father avoid paying taxes. It must run in the family.", "description": "The New York Times reports that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has subpoenaed Donald Trump\u2019s and the Trump Organization\u2019s federal and state tax returns dating back to 2011, as part of a criminal investigation into paying off Stormy Daniels.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/16/16-trump-taxes.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
