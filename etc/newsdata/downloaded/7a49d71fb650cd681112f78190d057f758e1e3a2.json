Bernie Sanders' campaign shake-up comes as some voters in New Hampshire weigh Sen. Elizabeth Warren as a better option to beat President Donald Trump. | Robert F. Bukaty/AP Photo 2020 elections Bernie Sanders shakes up campaign leadership in New Hampshire\n\nMANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders has replaced the New Hampshire state director of his presidential campaign after growing indignation from his fiercest supporters that their concerns about losing the first-in-the-nation primary states were being ignored.\n\nMore than 50 members from Sanders\u2019 state steering committee applauded on Sunday afternoon when they heard that Joe Caiazzo had been reassigned to Massachusetts, according to those in the room. The news was delivered by the new state director, Shannon Jackson, who ran Sanders\u2019 Senate reelection in 2018.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe people who helped Bernie win here last time knew and felt intimately that something was very different and not for the best,\u201d said a steering committee member who was at the meeting. \u201cWe know our state, we know our counties and we see what other campaigns on the ground are doing. We weren\u2019t happy with what we were seeing.\u201d\n\nThe shake-up comes as some progressive voters in New Hampshire weigh Sen. Elizabeth Warren as a better option to beat President Donald Trump. At a Democratic convention here just over a week ago, a noticeable number of state delegates who voted for Sanders in 2016 said they had moved their support to Warren . Even members of the Sanders steering committee \u2014 his most diehard supporters \u2014 said they were eyeing Warren.\n\nPolling in the state shows an extremely close race, with Sanders at 22 percent, former Vice President Joe Biden at 21.5 percent and Warren at 19.3 percent, according to the Real Clear Politics average of surveys.\n\nA Sanders adviser suggested another reason for Caiazzo\u2019s shift to Massachusetts, which is Warren\u2019s home state.\n\n\u201cGiven Sen. Warren\u2019s favorables in Massachusetts, there\u2019s a tremendous opportunity for competitors there,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cCoupled with the fact [that] Massachusetts has a large number of delegates, it\u2019s important to contest the commonwealth vigorously. Campaigns that don\u2019t are making a mistake.\u201d\n\nThe change is one of several staff shake-ups in recent weeks. The Sanders campaign also parted ways with senior adviser Kurt Ehrenberg, a well-respected local grassroots activist who was with Sanders from the start.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning there was a fundamental disagreement about how to run a successful primary campaign in New Hampshire,\u201d Ehrenberg said. \u201cThere was a strong disagreement.\u201d\n\nEhrenberg was a driving force behind Sanders\u2019 introduction to New Hampshire, helping him land major speaking engagements to union groups for almost a decade. He also served stints as both New Hampshire state and political director in Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign. Sanders beat Hillary Clinton by 22 points that year, helping to launch a nearly five-month nationwide primary battle.\n\nBen Collings also began working as the Maine state director for the Sanders campaign last week. A Sanders aide said that state directors or lead staff had recently been added in Oklahoma, Colorado and Minnesota, as well as Massachusetts. And some senior staff have been asked to move to the early caucus and primary states.\n\nAdditionally, Mike Casca, Sanders\u2019 rapid response-director in 2016, was hired as a senior communications adviser for Sanders. Ari Rabin-Havt and Arianna Jones were promoted to deputy campaign managers.\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said on Sunday that things were going well in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cWe feel really good about the situation in New Hampshire and where we find ourselves,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cThe campaign has a strong volunteer operation in that state, great staff, and the turnout of events with Bernie has been particularly strong as of late as well. So we feel very good about where we find ourselves in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re trying to think around the corner and see where the next challenges are going to lay and put ourselves in a position to secure the nomination, and we\u2019re making staff moves and hires in accordance with that.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 allies, however, said the campaign was failing the basics: Listen to your supporters and treat them with respect. At the meeting on Sunday, some drove several hours from northern New Hampshire to express their concerns.\n\n\u201cThe main issue has been disrespect and a squandering of the campaign base in 2016,\u201d a steering committee member said. \u201cThese are the people who are true believers Bernie Sanders would be a great president.\u201d\n\nAll of the committee members interviewed spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from the campaign. They said the campaign planned to announce the staffing changes on Monday.\n\n\u201cPeople felt disaffected, like, \u2018My God, how could they be doing this?\u2019\u201d another member said. \u201cThey said our metrics have been pretty good. But it just seems like something is off.\u201d", "description": "\u201cThe main issue has been disrespect and a squandering of the campaign base in 2016,\u201d a steering committee member said.", "authors": ["Holly Otterbein", "Trent Spiner"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9b/d2/8579ec0846a5a59ab0bd7c867f77/190915-bernie-sanders-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
