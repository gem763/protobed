(Abdul-Jabbar later starred in Lee\u2019s 1972 film \u201cGame of Death.\u201d)\n\nEchoing other criticism of Tarantino\u2019s film, particularly from Lee\u2019s daughter, Shannon, Abdul-Jabbar argued its exaggerated version of Lee (played by Korean American actor and martial artist Mike Moh) was inconsistent with the man he knew, and \u201charks back to the very stereotypes Bruce was trying to dismantle.\u201d\n\nThe real fight wasn\u2019t on the mat, it was on the screen in creating opportunities for Asians to be seen as more than grinning stereotypes. Unfortunately, \u2018Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\u2019 prefers the good old ways. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in The Hollywood Reporter\n\n\u201cI was in public with Bruce several times when some random jerk would loudly challenge Bruce to a fight. He always politely declined and moved on. First rule of Bruce\u2019s fight club was don\u2019t fight \u2014 unless there is no other option. He felt no need to prove himself,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar wrote. \u201cHe knew who he was and that the real fight wasn\u2019t on the mat, it was on the screen in creating opportunities for Asians to be seen as more than grinning stereotypes. Unfortunately, \u2018Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\u2019 prefers the good old ways.\u201d\n\nIn the film, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as fading TV actor Rick Dalton and Brad Pitt as his stunt double and right-hand man Cliff Booth, Lee challenges Booth to a fight.\n\nBooth then pummels the martial arts star into a car so hard that it leaves a dent, an incident meant to demonstrate how Booth is still a formidable stuntman, despite his declining career.\n\nAndrew Cooper/Sony Pictures Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) fighting Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) in Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\"\n\nAs Abdul-Jabbar pointed out, \u201cthe scene is complicated by being presented as a flashback, but in a way that could suggest the stuntman\u2019s memory is cartoonishly biased in his favor.\u201d\n\nDescribing his admiration for Tarantino\u2019s films, Abdul-Jabbar said he expected \u201cOnce Upon A Time In Hollywood\u201d to \u201cbe much more entertaining than a simple homage,\u201d consistent with the director\u2019s style, but that depicting Lee as a punchline was \u201ca lapse of cultural awareness\u201d on Tarantino\u2019s part.\n\n\u201cEven though we know the movie is fiction, those scenes will live on in our shared cultural conscience as impressions of those real people, thereby corrupting our memory of them built on their real-life actions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s why filmmakers have a responsibility when playing with people\u2019s perceptions of admired historic people to maintain a basic truth about the content of their character. Quentin Tarantino\u2019s portrayal of Bruce Lee in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood does not live up to this standard. Of course, Tarantino has the artistic right to portray Bruce any way he wants. But to do so in such a sloppy and somewhat racist way is a failure both as an artist and as a human being.\u201d\n\nAbdul-Jabbar said he wished that instead of making Lee \u201cjust another Hey Boy prop to the scene,\u201d Tarantino had included more details about Lee, including \u201chis struggle to be taken seriously in Hollywood,\u201d the discrimination he experienced and his limited career opportunities as an Asian man.\n\nSunset Boulevard via Getty Images Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (left) and Bruce Lee (right) in \"Game of Death.\"\n\nLee\u2019s daughter Shannon has repeatedly made similar points about seeing her father as an \u201carrogant punching bag\u201d in the film.\n\n\u201cIt was really uncomfortable to sit in the theater and listen to people laugh at my father,\u201d she told The Wrap last month.\n\nA representative for Tarantino did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment on Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s criticism Friday.\n\nThe filmmaker continues to defend the portrayal, saying last week that \u201cBruce Lee was kind of an arrogant guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way he was talking, I didn\u2019t just make a lot of that up,\u201d Tarantino said while promoting the film in Moscow. \u201cI heard him say things like that, to that effect.\u201d\n\nIn response, Shannon Lee said she wished the director would either \u201cshut up,\u201d apologize or acknowledge his faults.\n\n\u201cHe could say, \u2018I don\u2019t really know what Bruce Lee was like. I just wrote it for my movie. But that shouldn\u2019t be taken as how he really was,\u2019\u201d she told Variety.\n\nAs HuffPost\u2019s Matt Jacobs reported earlier this month, the scene was originally slated to be even more one-sided against Lee. But both Pitt and one of the film\u2019s stunt coordinators, Robert Alonzo, who is Asian American, pushed back and persuaded Tarantino to change it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain mythology and mysticism about who Bruce Lee is, which is understandable. Being an Asian American myself, I definitely related to how Bruce was a symbol of how Asians should be portrayed in movies, instead of the old \u2018Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\u2019 model that was really prevalent back in the day,\u201d Alonzo said. \u201cI had a difficult time choreographing a fight where he lost. Everyone involved was like, \u2018How is this going to go over?\u2019 Brad was very much against it. He was like, \u2018It\u2019s Bruce Lee, man!\u2019\u201d", "description": "The NBA legend, who says the martial arts icon was his \"friend and teacher,\" found \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" \u201cdisappointing\u201d and \u201cdisturbing.\u201d", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d4096d92400009d17936f2f.jpeg?cache=qugz84t4zz&ops=1778_1000"}
