As it welcomes another world-class event, we road test three famous climbs\n\nI have achieved a sort of cycling singularity. The UK cycling scene is obsessed with professional racing, hills, Yorkshire, social media \u2013 and pretentious coffee. And a couple of weeks ago, I set out to ride the undulating West and North Yorkshire route of the 2019 Road World Championships with a small-batch coffee roaster called Ben whom I\u2019d met on Twitter.\n\nOver the past five years, Yorkshire has become a global cycling destination. As Ben and I, and another Twitter acquaintance called Tom, rode out of Otley, north of Leeds, there were dozens of other riders heading out of town, up Wharfedale towards Bolton Abbey. None of them was in an organised group \u2013 just ones and twos, including quite a few children and teenagers.\n\nI doubt many of them were doing what we were planning: a 200km section of the men\u2019s elite race, involving a long loop north from Otley to Hawes, east up the gloriously named Buttertubs Pass, and then south through Ripon to finish in Harrogate.\n\nI\u2019d mentioned my plans to Otley native and 2015 world champion Lizzie Deignan. \u201cIf I press on a bit it shouldn\u2019t take more than about six hours,\u201d I said.\n\nThere was a pause. \u201cI think you might have underestimated that,\u201d she replied.\n\nI found it hard to find volunteers to keep me company. I asked the local Otley club. \u201cBit too much for most of us,\u201d was the response. I was undeterred. I shouldn\u2019t have been.\n\nThe explosion in Yorkshire cycling hasn\u2019t happened by accident. In 2014, the Tour de France started in Leeds, after Yorkshire had snatched the Grand Depart from under the nose of a rival Scottish bidder \u2013 largely, so the story goes, because the then chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, Gary Verity, flew to Paris in a chartered helicopter and brought the Tour\u2019s top brass back to Yorkshire for a pub lunch.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ahead of the 2014 Tour de France, cycling fans graffitied the road on Kidstones Pass, or C\u00f4te de Kidstones, a challenging category-four climb. Photograph: Rupert Sagar-Musgrave/Alamy\n\nVerity was clear about his desire to win the bid for Yorkshire. \u201cThe world\u2019s biggest sporting event is the Olympics. We couldn\u2019t get that: it was too big. The Fifa World Cup was too big. But the Tour de France? We could get that.\u201d\n\nThe event itself was extraordinary. No one had ever seen anything like it. Huge crowds lined the entire route, to the extent that staff in the team cars following the riders arrived at the finish with bladders the size of space-hoppers because there had been nowhere in 200km to stop for a quiet pee.\n\nThe 2014 Tour de France\u2019s legacy is the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Tours de Yorkshire \u2013 held every year since and sufficiently Frenchified that the climbs are now \u201cc\u00f4tes\u201d, as in the C\u00f4te de Buttertubs and Sheffield\u2019s legendary C\u00f4te de Jenkin Road. Cyclists come from all over the world to ride the now-famous roads. The Zwift virtual cycling app has a Yorkshire route, allowing riders on stationary bikes to sprint past Betty\u2019s Tea Rooms in Harrogate from the comfort of their own homes. And now the week-long World Championships festival is arriving.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Huge crowds lined the entire route when the 2014 Tour de France came to Yorkshire. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nTo those of us who\u2019ve been in the world of UK cycling for years, none of this was a surprise. Yorkshire is cycling country. It always has been. It is a wonderful place to go for a ride \u2013 as long as you like your riding hard.\n\nBen, Tom and I had three significant climbs to get over: Kidstones, Buttertubs and Grinton Moor. The first problem is that they sneak up on you. In the Alps, you can see a climb coming for miles as you approach along the valley. In Yorkshire, the roads undulate all the time. I was halfway up the C\u00f4te de Kidstones before it dawned on me this wasn\u2019t just another random lump \u2013 this hill was going to keep going. By that point, of course, I was committed to riding up it at an unwise pace.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Road winding across Grinton Moor. Photograph: Keith J Smith/Alamy\n\nI suspect Yorkshire does this to you deliberately. And here is something else: in other cycling meccas, the climbs have hairpins to even out the gradient. In Yorkshire, the roads go straight up. The climbs are not long, but they are steep. It\u2019s not at all unusual to find yourself out of the saddle, grunting to get the pedals round on a one-in-five gradient.\n\nThis sort of thing might punish the unwary outsider, but it manufactures great bike riders, such as Brian Robinson, the first British Tour de France stage winner, in 1958; Barry Hoban, who won eight Tour stages between 1967 and 1975; and world champion Tom Simpson, who grew up in Harworth, Nottinghamshire, but learned his riding over the border. Deignan will get to race through her home town at this year\u2019s Worlds. And, of course, there\u2019s the peerless Beryl Burton, winner of seven world titles in the 1960s and 70s and an astonishing 72 UK titles at various distances between 1958 and 1986.\n\nIt\u2019s the relentlessness of the roads that makes it different. You have to work for everything. An hour\u2019s ride in Yorkshire is worth an hour-and-a-quarter in most other places. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that the roads are hard \u2013 the weather can be bad, too,\u201d said Deignan. \u201cWhen I turned pro, I\u2019d find myself riding up some French mountain in the pouring rain, and that was fine.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest View over Buttertubs pass in The Yorkshire Dales. Photograph: Alamy\n\nThe C\u00f4te de Buttertubs is brutally steep, an incline of almost one in five. It comes too early in the race to really play a decisive part, but it\u2019s the climb that will produce the defining images of the World Championships. Just a few minutes away from the little town of Hawes, it feels untouched and wild.\n\nIt\u2019s barren and exposed, with no shelter beyond some low drystone walls. There are no trees on Buttertubs; even the grass is close cropped by the sheep. The narrow road clings to the side of the steep valley then turns inland to run through a natural amphitheatre which, when the race arrives, will be crowded with fans and flags. It\u2019s the essence of Yorkshire, and it\u2019s utterly lovely. The climb took us about 20 minutes \u2013 the pros will probably do it in 13.\n\nBut 200km was, as I\u2019d been warned, too much. By the time we were heading back south towards Ripon and Harrogate, I was finding every excuse I could to freewheel for a moment\u2019s respite. More than once I tried freewheeling only to discover that I wasn\u2019t even going downhill, I just desperately wanted to be. Of course, I didn\u2019t say anything. I was pleased beyond words when Tom said he was exhausted, too. \u201cGo on ahead, if you want to get back,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d I said magnanimously. \u201cLet\u2019s back off a bit. I don\u2019t mind at all.\u201d\n\nThe sense of achievement in getting to Harrogate (after seven hours) was immense, but I\u2019d have to admit that Deignan and the Otley club were right. I had underestimated it. And I\u2019d do it again tomorrow.\n\n\u2022 The UCI Road World Championships run from 22-29 September. For those who don\u2019t fancy 200km of properly hard riding, the events are held over a variety of courses and distances, starting at 14km.

The (smallish) menu is spot on, and they\u2019ll even lend you a lock. It\u2019s co-owned by Terrorvision singer, Tony Wright.\n\nPrologue, Harrogate\n\nA bike shop-cum-cafe that offers good coffee and food, and the chance to ogle some nice kit. If you\u2019re having doubts about your ability to complete a ride, it also sells a range of ebikes.\n\nPenny Garth Cafe, Hawes\n\nBefore tackling Buttertubs, we stopped at this cafe that has been a Yorkshire Dales cyclists\u2019 (and motorcyclists\u2019) stopping-off point for many years. The food is straightforward and inexpensive \u2013 more bacon butty than smashed avocado \u2013 which is usually just what you want mid-ride.\n\nThe Commute, Ilkley\n\nAnother cafe-cum-shop, this is generally quite busy on any day with half-decent weather (ie, if the rain isn\u2019t horizontal) and serves excellent coffee from Allpress.\n\nEchelon Coffee, Leeds\n\nBefore you head out, fortify yourself with some excellent small-batch roasted coffee bought from Ben, my riding companion.", "description": "Yorkshire folk have long known the region is brilliant for cycling \u2013 hosting the 2014 Tour de France just confirmed it.
