Since the show premiered in 2010, hundreds of thousands of viewers have made the pilgrimage to England to see the grand house that\u2019s as familiar to them as their own.\n\nWith the release of the \"Downton Abbey\" movie, Highclere Castle is expected to attract even more guests who want to see where their favorite characters live and scheme.\n\n\"Our research shows that films are powerful motivators for travel, with almost a third of potential visitors keen to visit places seen onscreen,\" said Paul Gauger, Senior Vice President for the Americas at VisitBritain. \"28% of all trips to the UK include a visit to a castle or historic house, and 42% of travelers from California and the Tri-State area want to visit Highclere Castle.\"\n\nLocated in the British countryside about an hour outside of Oxford, the 5,000-acre property served as inspiration for creator Julian Fellowes\u2019 wildly successful period drama, and much of the show (and the movie) was actually filmed in the 19th century manor house.\n\n\"The estate is the most important star of the show,\" admitted Hugh Bonneville, a.k.a. Lord Grantham, in a documentary about the making of \"Downton Abbey.\"\n\nWith a striking exterior that \u2013 unlike some of the cast members (Mrs. Hughes and Mrs. Patmore, we're looking at you) \u2013 looks the same onscreen and off, it\u2019s easily the most recognizable.\n\nIn fact, Highclere Castle has become so iconic that, since it opened to the public, tickets to visit always sell out quickly and lines are long as guests make their way through the house, checking out the sisters\u2019 bedrooms, the cozy library and the dining room where so many memorable Crawley meals have taken place.\n\nThe dining room at Highclere Castle \u2014 Photo courtesy of Highclere Castle\n\nTo get the most immersive and intimate experience, though, Viking \u2013 a sponsor of \"Downton Abbey\" from the beginning \u2013 just introduced a new pre/post cruise extension on their Rhine Getaway river cruise itinerary and British Isles Explorer ocean cruise itinerary which gives guests Privileged Access\u00ae to Highclere Castle.\n\n\"Many of our guests were introduced to both Viking and Highclere Castle while watching the 'Downton Abbey' series,\" said Karine Hagen, Executive Vice President of Viking. \"For this reason, we are linked in the minds of many 'Downton Abbey' fans.\"\n\nLady Carnarvon and Karine Hagen at Highclere Castle \u2014 Photo courtesy of Viking\n\nViking\u2019s \"Great Homes, Gardens & Gin\" lets you enjoy a private tour of the castle when it is not open to the public, which is a huge benefit since it gives you the space and time to really take in your surroundings and reminisce about unforgettable moments on the show. Just don\u2019t expect to visit the kitchen and servants\u2019 quarters. Those were constructed and filmed at Ealing Studios in London.\n\nIf you\u2019re a \"Downton Abbey\" fan, there\u2019s a magical, surreal feeling to being in the actual rooms where it happened. Just pulling up to the property and getting that first breathtaking glimpse of Highclere will cue the opening music in your head and have you looking around for Lord Grantham\u2019s four-legged best friend.\n\nAlthough you won\u2019t be greeted by Thomas or Mr. Carson, you will receive a champagne welcome from their real-life counterparts before starting your tour led by a Highclere historian.\n\nThe drawing room at Highclere Castle \u2014 Photo courtesy of Highclere Castle\n\nMany Viking guests do get to meet the vivacious Lady Carnarvon, who is happy to share personal stories about the 300-room castle she calls home and how life has changed since \"Downton Abbey.\"\n\n\"The show has been phenomenal,\" she said. \"It has such an authentic foundation which acts as an anchor in an uncertain world, and I think that\u2019s partly because Highclere Castle is real. It\u2019s all about family and friends and cooking, and it\u2019s just as much a home to its staff. That feeling resonates with viewers.\"\n\nThe new tour also offers an opportunity to taste the recently-launched Highclere Castle Gin, a super-premium London Dry Gin inspired by botanicals from the castle\u2019s gardens, which have been featured on the show and which you can explore and pretend are your own as you walk around the stunning grounds.\n\nAfter leaving Highclere, you\u2019ll visit the charming village of Bampton, which doubles as the village of Downton. You\u2019ll recognize many of the buildings, including St Mary\u2019s Church, which \u2013 as St. Michael and All Angels on \"Downton Abbey\" \u2013 hosted some pretty dramatic events including weddings and, um, near-weddings.\n\n\"Downton Abbey\" fans will recognize many of the buildings in the village of Bampton \u2014 Photo courtesy of Helene Cohen Bludman\n\nChurchgate House, the old Bampton rectory, was used for the exterior shots of Isobel Crawley\u2019s house, and the old Grammar School building served as the Downton hospital. The building now houses Bampton Community Archive, which features a selection of \"Downton Abbey\" memorabilia.\n\n\"Great Homes, Gardens & Gin\" may be the latest tour Viking has created to let guests experience \"Downton Abbey,\" but it\u2019s not the only one. The original, \"Oxford & Highclere Castle,\" has been Viking\u2019s highest-rated pre/post extension to date, and the new tour may surpass it.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried that you\u2019ll never be able to get tickets, just heed the advice of Maggie Smith\u2019s Downager Countess: \"Don\u2019t be defeatist, dear. It\u2019s very middle class.\"", "description": "Spend a couple of hours at Highclere Castle, where you can fantasize that you're a member of the Crawley family.", "authors": ["Lois Alter Mark"], "top_image": "https://img1.10bestmedia.com/Images/Photos/372266/Highclere-VB34169099_54_990x660.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
