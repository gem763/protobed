Parliament TV via REUTERS/File Photo\n\nBut with the main opposition Labour Party waiting for the European Union to grant a Brexit delay and two other parties launching their own bid for an even earlier election, the government\u2019s bid so far looks set to fail.\n\nBritain was due to leave the EU on Thursday, but despite the government arguing this is still the legal default date, few expect Johnson to meet his \u201cdo or die\u201d promise to deliver Brexit on Oct. 31 after the bloc agreed to another delay.\n\nMore than three years since Britain voted to leave the EU, the divided country and its parliament are still debating over how, when and even whether Brexit, Britain\u2019s biggest policy shift for more than 40 years, should happen.\n\nAll Britain\u2019s political parties agree an election is needed to break the standoff over Brexit, but cannot agree on its timing. For many lawmakers, an attempt by Johnson to set the terms of a new election raises concerns that he might renege.\n\n\u201cParliament cannot hold the country hostage any longer,\u201d Johnson said late on Saturday. \u201cMillions of businesses and people cannot plan their futures, this paralysis is causing real damage and the country must move on in 2020.\u201d\n\nHis culture minister, Nicky Morgan, doubled down on the message on Sunday, warning lawmakers that Thursday was still \u201cthe default leaving date\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo that should focus minds,\u201d she told Sky News.\n\nAsked what would happen if the government failed on Monday in its early election bid, Morgan said: \u201cWe will keep asking for that election and we will find ways to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSTOP THROWING TANTRUMS\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Johnson called for a general election on Dec. 12, offering parliament until Nov. 6 to ratify his Brexit deal - the first time Britain\u2019s prime minister had conceded he would not meet his Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nIt is his third attempt to get the required backing in parliament, where he needs the support of two-thirds of its 650 lawmakers for a new election.\n\nAlmost immediately, Labour said it could not back a new election until the party was sure a so-called no-deal Brexit had been taken off the table.\n\nOn Sunday, the party\u2019s health policy chief, Jon Ashworth, again said the party would wait for the EU to decide on the length of any Brexit extension before taking a decision.\n\n\u201cOf course we want a general election but we\u2019ve got to make sure that we get those absolute reassurances that Boris Johnson won\u2019t use a general election and the campaign to crash us out of the European Union with a disastrous no-deal Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat is what we\u2019re waiting for.\u201d\n\nThe EU has agreed there should be an extension but has set no departure date, saying it would wait to see how parliament voted on Johnson\u2019s call for an early election.\n\nTaking a different tack, two other opposition parties, the Scottish National Party and Liberal Democrats, have written to Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, to ask for a delay until Jan. 31. They want a new poll on Dec. 9.\n\nBut the Conservatives and Labour described the move as a stunt, putting into question whether the two parties\u2019 alternative bid could be passed by parliament.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks at the House of Commons as parliament discusses Brexit, sitting on a Saturday for the first time since the 1982 Falklands War, in London, Britain, October 19, 2019, in this screen grab taken from video.

This is not the time to be holding a general election, it is a time for cool heads and grown-up government,\u201d Hammond told Sky News.\n\n\u201cThe government should stop making threats, stop throwing tantrums and get on with the grown-up business of doing its business.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson's Conservatives stepped up pressure on lawmakers on Sunday to back the prime minister's bid to hold an early election and break Britain's Brexit impasse, saying the country was being held \"hostage\" by parliament.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445483088&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0CP", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
