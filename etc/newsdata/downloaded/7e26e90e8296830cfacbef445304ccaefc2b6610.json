The Western in its Ford-Wayne heyday knew itself to be mainstream and middlebrow, but even in its gazillion-dollar apotheosis the world of \u201cgenre\u201d still maintains a fan base that imagines itself eccentric and disrespected and oppressed.\n\nThis nurtured sense of grievance explains the online anger every time somebody like Scorsese dares to doubt the aesthetic merits of the new regime. And it may be a strength of the superhero order, a source of resilience, that so many of its fans continue to answer Andrew O\u2019Hehir\u2019s 2012 question, \u201cat what point is the triumph of comic-book culture sufficient?\u201d, with a zealot\u2019s absolutism: Not until the last film snob shuts up; not until Scorsese breaks down and makes a Batman sequel.\n\nBut maybe that zeal hides an uneasy conscience, a buried knowledge that while \u201cgenre\u201d cinema can be as great as any other form \u2014 I\u2019m counting down the days to the new Dune adaptation \u2014 its complete commercial takeover has been obviously bad for popular culture and pop art.\n\nThe superhero regime has wasted far too much talent on stories that are fundamentally unworthy of the actors and directors making them. It has empowered and interacted with corporate consolidation, including the devouring power of a Disney empire that is now literally disappearing classic movies from the theater circuit into its corporate vault. And it has habituated adult audiences to stories that belong \u2014 with, yes, exceptions \u2014 to the state of arrested development in which far more of Western culture than just Hollywood is trapped.", "description": "In the Martin Scorsese and \u201cJoker\u201d controversies, hints of resistance to the rule of comic books.", "authors": ["Ross Douthat"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/opinion/27douthat/27douthat-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
