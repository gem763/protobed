After a meeting with doctors earlier in the day, Murphy said Ward-Blake\u2019s prognosis was determined to be \u201cuncertain.\u201d\n\nAccording to police, the incident began around 5:35 p.m. when an officer saw an expired tag and approached the car Ward-Blake was driving. The officer then reported smelling marijuana emanating from the vehicle, which also carried a 6-year-old girl.\n\nAD\n\nWhen the officer attempted to write down information, the driver began shouting and reached toward a console inside the car, according to police, who said the officer called for backup.\n\nOfficers removed Ward-Blake from the car and handcuffed him. Police say he then attempted to escape and was stopped by an officer who pulled him to the ground, where he hit his neck on the road.\n\nAD\n\nPolice filed charges of assault, resisting arrest and possession of more than 10 grams of marijuana. Ward-Blake has been charged, said a police spokesman, Cpl. Nicholas Clayton, but because he is hospitalized the warrants have not been served.\n\nPrince George\u2019s Police Chief Hank Stawinski on Saturday called the incident a \u201chorrible accident\u201d and said he had no information that led him to believe the officers acted maliciously. Police called an ambulance within three minutes and the man underwent surgery, Stawinski said.\n\nAD\n\nPolice previously have said dashboard cameras were operating but did not capture the full encounter and that the officers did not have body-worn cameras.\n\nMurphy said that the investigation is continuing. \u201cWe ask that you pray for Demonte and his family during this very difficult time,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year, the family of Jordan McNair, a 19-year-old University of Maryland football player who collapsed and died during a practice, retained the law firm in its wrongful-death claims against the university.\n\nAD", "description": "Police said Demonte Ward-Blake landed on his neck while handcuffed.
