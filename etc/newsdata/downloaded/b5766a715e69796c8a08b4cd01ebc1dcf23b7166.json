The Wall Street Journal first reported McDougal\u2019s alleged catch-and-kill deal just days before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHoward and Pecker later struck an immunity deal with federal prosecutors investigating Trump-related campaign law violations in the Southern District of New York.\n\nFarrow\u2019s revelations about Howard, Pecker and AMI\u2014based in part on his previous reporting in the New Yorker\u2014detail multiple instances in which Howard was allegedly at Harvey Weinstein\u2019s beck and call, participating in damage-control strategy sessions and dropping everything to rush to the producer\u2019s side while ordering AMI reporters to gather negative material on actress Rose McGowan, who had accused Weinstein of raping her in a hotel room at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival.\n\n\u201cI want dirt on that bitch,\u201d Farrow quotes Howard declaring in reference to McGowan, after another actress, Ashley Judd, claimed that an unnamed studio head (whom she later identified as Weinstein) had sexually harassed her.\n\n\u201c AMI reporters were asked to pursue negative items about her going to rehab \u201d\n\n\u201cAMI reporters were asked to pursue negative items about her going to rehab,\u201d Farrow writes about Judd.\n\nFarrow recounts another incident\u2014which Howard denies\u2014in which the Enquirer editor allegedly was at Weinstein\u2019s service in early October 2017, as the New York Times was readying its blockbuster story on the mogul\u2019s misconduct:\n\n\u201cThe first week of October, Weinstein\u2019s assistants emailed Dylan Howard: \u2018We just tried you, but Harvey wanted to see if you could instead meet him in front of the NY Times Building on 8th Ave near 43d Street. He\u2019s on his way up there no [sic] so should be there in about 30 minutes.\u2019\n\n\u201cOriginally, Weinstein had asked his staff to make sure Howard joined him and Lisa Bloom for the drive uptown from the Weinstein Company offices to the Times. But Bloom and Weinstein had left without Howard, so the Enquirer editor would have to scramble uptown himself, manila folders in hand, containing \u2018basically dirt\u2019 on Weinstein\u2019s accusers\u2026\u201d\n\nFarrow also reports an incident in which Howard met over breakfast at the Tribeca Grill with Weinstein, the mogul\u2019s lawyer Lanny Davis and an operative from the Israeli private surveillance company Black Cube, as they discussed possible strategies to combat Rose McGowan.\n\nAnd when the New York Times story was finally published on Oct. 6, 2017, Howard was at the Weinstein Company, offering moral support and helping with damage control, Farrow writes. \u201cOh shit,\u201d he exclaimed when the expos\u00e9 hit the Web.\n\nAfter Italian-Filipina model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez filed a complaint with the New York Police Department accusing Weinstein of groping her breasts, \u201cWeinstein particularly exploited his bond with Pecker and Howard at the National Enquirer,\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cWeinstein\u2019s employees recalled an uptick in calls from him to Pecker. Howard ordered his staff to stand down on reporting about Gutierrez\u2019s claim, then inquired about purchasing her story in order to bury it. And then there was the item the Enquirer ultimately ran, claiming, apparently based on its own entreaties to Gutierrez, that she was flogging the story on the open market.\u201d\n\nFarrow also writes about Howard in personal terms. He \u201chad a vindictive streak\u201d and boasted about scandalous knowledge that gave him leverage over the rich and powerful.\n\nQuoting \u201cfriends and colleagues of Dylan Howard,\u201d Farrow writes that AMI\u2019s former chief content officer \u201chad boasted he had evidence that Trump may have fathered a love child with his former housekeeper in the late 1980s. Howard \u2018would sometimes say things when he was drunk or high. Including telling me they would pay for stories and not publish, to protect people,\u2019 one of his friends told me. \u2018You don\u2019t forget when someone says, \u2018Oh, by the way. The maybe-future president has a love child.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c We have advised Mr. Howard to make no further comment at this stage, while all legal options and jurisdictions are being considered \u201d\n\nReached by The Daily Beast, Howard declined to comment on Farrow\u2019s book. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will get a response from my lawyers or AMI,\u201d he texted.\n\nHoward\u2019s London-based lawyer Paul Tweed\u2014whose eponymous law firm is one of three that the tabloid muckraker has hired to combat Farrow\u2019s book (with the other two being New York\u2019s Kravet & Vogel and Australia\u2019s McLachlan Thorpe Partners)\u2014emailed: \u201cWe have advised Mr. Howard to make no further comment at this stage, while all legal options and jurisdictions are being considered.\u201d\n\nAn AMI spokesperson, while not specifically addressing Farrow\u2019s allegations, emailed: \u201cMr. Farrow's narrative is driven by unsubstantiated allegations from questionable sources and while these stories may be dramatic, they are completely untrue.\u201d", "description": "In his new book, Farrow claims Howard was at Harvey Weinstein\u2019s beck and call, ordering AMI reporters to gather negative material on McGowan, who had accused Weinstein of rape.", "authors": ["Lloyd Grove", "Editor At Large"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571097617/191014-Cartwright-Catch-and-kill-tease_z7dfa5", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
