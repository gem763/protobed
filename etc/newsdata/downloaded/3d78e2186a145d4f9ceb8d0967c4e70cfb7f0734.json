Here's everything you need to know about the latest Golf\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Spot the difference: The Golf's silhouette is almost unchanged, and - of course - it retains the iconic boomerang-shaped C-pillar\n\nThe Golf has been around for a long time. Since 1974, to be precise. And VW has sold more than 35 million examples in that time.\n\nBut while much has changed in the last 45 years, the design principles behind Volkswagen's stalwart hatchback remain almost untouched.\n\nIn fact, if you line the 2020 car alongside the one coming to the end of its lifecycle you'll struggle to tell them apart.\n\nSize it up with a tape measure and you'll find that the Mk8 has grown just marginally. And, of course, the traditional boomerang-shaped C-pillar - an iconic feature of the Golf's look - has been retained for the eighth time of asking.\n\nThat said, it does have a new face - with a longer bonnet, squinting headlights and a narrower grille.\n\nBut it's the changes under the skin that are the biggest talking points for this car...\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Park the Mk7 (left) and Mk8 (right) side-by-side and it can be difficult to tell them apart. The updated VW logo on the grille is the biggest giveaway\n\nThe Volkswagen Golf dates back eight generations to the Mk1 launched in 1974. As you can see, the styling has been evolutionary over time\n\nScreen? It has them? There's barely a switch or button in sight, as Volkswagen has gone for a minimalist design with all the functionality via a touchscreen mounted in the centre of the dashboard\n\nBoth the driver's display and the infotainment systems are high-definition interfaces. Buyers of the cheapest model in Germany and mainland Europe will get a smaller 8.5 inch screen, while customers in Briton will get the bigger 10-inch unit\n\n1. It's got more screens than a Currys TV department\n\nThe German car maker says the Golf is the first model in this price bracket to feature a 'completely digital cockpit'. That's because the driver's display and instrument cluster has been bundled into a new 10.25-inch screen and controls for the temperature, connectivity and radio are housed in another high-definition panel.\n\nBuyers of entry-spec models in Germany and the rest of mainland Europe will have to slum it with an 8.5-inch touchscreen as this second 'infotainment' display. Whereas customers in Britain get the bigger 10-inch screen as standard. Thanks Brexit (and right hand drive).\n\nIf that's not enough to make your eyes go square, there'll also be an optional wide-screen head-up display that beams information directly onto the front window.\n\nWhile this will likely make the Golf cabin feel like sitting in a TV department of Currys, it does mean there's hardly any buttons. Even switches for the lights and window heating have been removed in favour of a digital panel to give the interior the sort of minimalist design Kevin McCloud waxes lyrically about.\n\nAn app and a compatible Samsung smartphone could be all you need to lock, unlock and start the new Golf. However, VW UK is hesitant about making this feature available in Britain\n\n2. Who needs a key when you have a [compatible] phone?\n\nA new app will allow owners to lock, unlock and start their Golf with a smartphone, but only if it's a Samsung.\n\nVolkswagen UK says this feature will not be available from launch on UK cars and there will be no communication to customers about this function (or did we just let the cat out of the bag?). Probably a good idea given the recent spate of relay vehicle thefts.\n\nHowever, it isn't ruling out introducing the feature at a later date. Hopefully you won't need to store your phone in the fridge to fend off keyless car thieves.\n\nThe Golf becomes the first compact family hatchback to have a semi-autonomous driving mode. And it can function on motorways at up to speeds of 130mph\n\n3. 'I wasn't speeding, officer. It was the car!'\n\nThis is the first Golf to feature semi-autonomous driving technology. In fact, it's a first for any model in this segment.\n\nCalled 'Travel Assist', it gives owners the option of letting the car share some of the driving - but only on motorways. The vehicle steers, accelerates and brakes itself and the system will operate at speeds of up to 210kmh - that's 130mph in English.\n\nFor legal and safety reasons, you can't just kick back and let the Golf take you around the M25, even if you stick below the 70mph speed limit. Drivers will have to keep one hand on the wheel at all times, or else be beeped at and jolted by the car and - if you don't put your mitts on the wheel within the designated time-frame - you will eventually be brought to a standstill.\n\nRevealing all your secrets? The Golf comes with a new feature called Car2X. Other vehicles with this installed will be able to share information with you vehicle to notify one another about potential risks and traffic jams around their location\n\n4. It talks to other vehicles behind your back\n\nThe robots are officially taking over; this car can communicate with other vehicles.\n\nThat's because it's the first VW model to use a feature called Car2X. This allows it to talk to other models with this system installed. In order to share information the two vehicles need to be within an 800-metre radius. Data can be pinged from one to the other in a matter of milliseconds.\n\nIt won't be gossiping about you to other Golfs, though. Instead it can send and receive alerts about accidents, broken-down vehicles, traffic jams, roadworks and any emergency vehicles in the immediate vicinity.\n\nSet a destination in the satellite navigation and the online connectivity unit will provide you with all the information you need to know about where you're going. If it's a restaurant, this includes the eatery's phone number so you can pre-book a table\n\n5. It can become your PA (but it won't pick up your dry-cleaning)\n\nAnother first for the Mk8 Golf is something call an online connectivity unit (OCU) that essentially Googles all the information about the destination you've entered into the navigation system and presents it to you on the screen.\n\nFor instance, if you've entered a restaurant as the locations you'll be visiting, the OCU will go online to find the phone number, plumb it into the display so at the push of a button you can call ahead to make sure they have a table spare.\n\nThe OCU is part of the WeConnect feature, which VW says will be offered for three years as standard in the UK, rather than one year in Germany. Double Brexit win.\n\nFour petrols and two diesels will be available from launch. Given VW's monumental emissions cheating scandal, you'd imagine the oil burners are pretty clean\n\n6. Don't you dare say dieselgate!\n\nFour petrols - all turbocharged - will be available from launch. Two will be three-cylinder 1.0-litre units while the more potent variants will be 1.5-litre motors with active cylinder shutdown - knocking out one of the four cylinders when you're driving in town to conserve fuel.\n\nAs for diesels, there'll be a pair of 2.0-litre TDI powerplants. VW says they've been 'significantly optimised' to cut CO2 emissions and have 'dual AdBlue injection' to reduce NOx outputs by up to 80 per cent. We imagine the authenticity of these will be extensively scrutinised by the powers that be.\n\n'TGI' models with natural gas engines will be sold in Germany, but the UK head office says they're a no-go for British dealers.\n\nThere is a GTE plug-in hybrid variant, and it's actually the most powerful Golf you'll be able to buy when it first arrives in the UK next year\n\n7. The Golf GTE lives on\n\nVolkswagen will offer three 'mild hybrids' and also the full-blooded (or is that volted?) plug-in GTE.\n\nThe German brand says the one the UK market is getting is geared towards performance, packing a total output of 242bhp. It will use a 1.4-litre petrol engine, electric drive motor, six-speed DSG automatic gearbox and 13kWh lithium-ion battery that is said to have 50 per cent more energy capacity than the Mk7 GTE. That should get you across town without using a drop of unleaded, VW claims.\n\nWhile the GTE was revealed, there was no GTI unveiled. The wraps are likely to come off that next year. That means the plug-in hybrid is the most powerful Mk8 Golf you can buy at launch.\n\nThere isn't going to be a new e-Golf. That's because the ID.3 - the first of VW's ID range of electric cars - arrives next year. It will cost from around \u00a330,000 and promises a range of 260 miles between charges\n\n8. ...but the e-Golf is dead\n\nWhile the GTE has escaped the guillotine. the e-Golf's a gonner.\n\nThat because Volkswagen will launch it's all-electric ID. range from next year, starting with the ID.3, which is almost identical in size to the Golf.\n\nOwners will be able to update and upgrade the technology in the car using the online functionality - a feature that's won Elon Musk's Tesla range plenty of praise in recent years\n\n9. It's nicked one of Elon's ideas\n\nOne of the best features of Elon Musk's range of Tesla cars is that they can receive software updates wirelessly. And this will be the case for the Golf, too.\n\nExisting features will not only be updated by going online, owners will also be able to upgrade their cars and add functionality they - or the first registered keeper - didn't originally choose.\n\nIt will be the safest Golf yet, and potentially the best hatchback on sale to avoid a crash. The adaptive cruise control also has an automatic speed limiter built into it\n\n10. Hate the thought of automatic speed limiters? It has one (sort of)\n\nThere was a fair bit of public uproar earlier this year when it was revealed that EU decision makers are considering making built-in speed limiters mandatory for all new cars from 2022. Well, the Golf already has the technology in place.\n\nIts adaptive cruise control system - when being used - can read speed limit road signs and automatically slow the car to keep within the restriction. Even better than that, it uses GPS tracking and continuous mapping to identify when it's approaching a tight turn, junction or roundabout and progressively reduces the speed before arriving at it.\n\nIntelligent safety kit has also been given an overhaul. As well as the normal features you'd expect from a modern car, it gets an enhanced Cyclist Monitoring mode to help you avoid pedallers and an automated system that recognises when you're turning at a junction and stops you from pulling out when another vehicle's approaching.\n\nFull UK details regarding specifications (including claimed fuel consumption), prices and availability will be released at a later date.", "description": "While there's no denying the exterior styling is almost identical to the version it replaces, VW says the new Golf Mk8 has been crammed with a host of technology.
