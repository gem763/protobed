Take the wheel. Because I can\u2019t see the former White House press secretary shake his latex-clad chest behind his partner\u2019s glittery-pineapple bosom without texting my therapist.\n\nWe knew it was coming, but actually seeing Spicer on the celebrity dance show, which debuted last night, is still hard to believe. Could this be the man who referred to concentration camps as \u201cHolocaust centers\u201d? While seeming to defend Adolf Hitler? Who said that Donald Trump actually meant to type \u201ccovfefe\u201d on Twitter, an accident of his Diet Coke\u2013addled finger stubs?\n\nAm I the only one who caught Lamar Odom\u2019s reaction to Sean Spicer\u2019s score? #DWTS pic.twitter.com/h0sXHNOuSv \u2014 Koury Wilson (@KouryRVA) September 17, 2019\n\nSpicer himself in his video introduction confirmed that, yes, it was. \u201cThere\u2019s no question my time in the White House was tumultuous,\u201d he said, which is one way to put it.\n\nEven before Spicer started dancing, when it became immediately clear that he would be humiliating himself (his partner referred to his skills as \u201cpre-preschool level\u201d), and after, when judges said he seemed to be \u201cattacked by a swarm of wasps\u201d onstage, there was no joy.\n\nBecause we also knew that Spicer is as immune to shame as he is unable to pull off neon green. That this nightmare vortex would open and absolutely nothing would happen. Except even more bad things, like Spicer\u2019s tweet about his performance in response to \u2026 Mike Huckabee: \u201cClearly the judges aren\u2019t going to be with me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s send a message to #Hollywood that those of us who stand for #Christ won\u2019t be discounted. May God bless you.\u201d\n\nDancing With the Stars, for Christ. This is where things stand now.\n\nStay in touch.
