It\u2019s \u201cthe biggest trending topic since Brexit,\u201d Ru says, and I\u2019ll let that cringey reference slide for the fact that it\u2019s not not relevant to the rest of the episode. (You\u2019ll see.)\n\nWe\u2019re immediately treated to some Snatch Game drama, which is, in my expert opinion, some of them most delicious drama on the show. Divina shows off a wig and explains that she\u2019s prepared former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, which prompts Blu to lay a hand on her arm to tell her that Baga is also planning to do Maggie. They even both demonstrate their skill with the same line, \u201cThe lady\u2019s not for turning\u201d \u2014 which is apparently a reference to a speech? This is just the beginning of the U.K.-specific political references this episode that flew right over my very American head, but what I do know is that Divina made a bad decision by giving Margaret (and Margaret\u2019s clothes, no less!) to Baga without a fight, after Baga said she hadn\u2019t really prepared anyone else. (It\u2019s never touched on in the episode, but I think Baga just didn\u2019t want to give up the character.) Oh well, Divina will just do Julia Child!\n\nRu soon comes for his rounds, bringing along Alan Carr! Every season, RuPaul Charles impresses me with his ability to guess a contestant\u2019s Snatch game character based on the wig and clothes they\u2019ve laid out \u2014 and I have to say, I didn\u2019t expect one of the comedic effects of a U.K. spinoff to be that he\u2019s become terrible at it! Give me a whole hour of RuPaul looking with puzzlement at an outfit only to be told it\u2019s for someone like Sir David Attenborough (\u201cI\u2019m not getting it because I\u2019m American?\u201d) and pretending to know who Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry is!\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s business as usual except for that the Vivienne has three impressions prepared, including a take on Beatles associate Cilla Black, complete with fake teeth, that brings the whole werkroom down. I can tell that it\u2019s a winning choice, and I just want to see more! I\u2019m also pulling for Sum Ting to choose iconic \u201csensual\u201d TV chef Nigella Lawson (glorious! golden! globules!) over \u2026 a nature broadcaster? But Blu has gotten in touch with her saboteur side and knows Nigella would be strong, so she pushes Sum Ting toward Sir David. If Divina won\u2019t play the game, at least someone will!\n\nAnd fuck my drag, right, because we get to the Snatch Game and I see that not only has Sum Ting chosen Attenborough, but the Vivienne has ignored my advice through my laptop screen and is all oranged-up to play Donald Trump. Joining them are Divina\u2019s Julia Child, Cheryl as TV personality (from Essex) Gemma Collins, Baga\u2019s Maggie Thatcher, Crystal as Rue McClanahan (as Blanche Devereux of Golden Girls), and Blu\u2019s Mary Berry.\n\nWe\u2019re off, and I\u2019m ready to be snatched. Even if (skip this part, Alec Baldwin) I\u2019m tired of Trump impersonations, I have to agree with Ru that the Vivienne does a spot-on voice, although we all know Snatch Game is about more than an imitation. I\u2019m not sold on the jokes, which seem less like off-the-cuff responses because of how highly referential they are. There are a few good lines (\u201cA bath of piss, it\u2019s great. That\u2019s how I keep my color\u201d), along with some excellent banter with The Right Honourable Margaret Thatcher. And speaking of! Baga gives her a vampire-esque look and doesn\u2019t miss a beat with her deep voice \u2014 when Ru is surprised that she\u2019d call Michelle Visage \u201cBelgrano Spice,\u201d Baga simply replies, \u201cLike the ship, she likes to go down,\u201d and it\u2019s the best line of the whole show. The other standout, to me, is Blu, who takes the adorable old baker we know and love and turns her into an octogenarian sex fiend. That there\u2019s absolutely no backstory just makes it better.\n\nExactly one girl, Cheryl Hole, falls in the middle for me \u2014 her doing an Essex girl meant she was the only one not using some level of a voice, but it was fine \u2014 and the rest (including a winner and top from last week!) were varying degrees of bad. Divina\u2019s Julia Child isn\u2019t quite as bad as Milk\u2019s confused one from season six, just boring. Ru puts jokes right in front of her and she still misses them \u2014 I mean, every Julia fan knows she enjoys \u201ccooking with wine\u201d! Crystal is the least memorable alongside Cheryl, but with fewer jokes; she gets exactly one at the end about McClanahan\u2019s death from syphilis. And then there\u2019s Sum Ting, who dragged up someone who is the polar opposite of drag and whose performance veers more toward educational than comedic. Couldn\u2019t she have just ceded her time to Baga?\n\nIn the werkroom the next day, Blu, who for some reason thinks she needs to apologize for breathing comedic life into Mary Berry, stirs things up once again by asking Divina if she thought she could\u2019ve done a better Thatcher. Divina thinks she could have, and I would like to see it!\n\nSaboteur though she may be, I cannot continue to shade Blu Hydrangea in this recap because, as the girls are painting, she gets into a conversation about marriage (Divina is; Cheryl and Crystal are engaged) and explains that Northern Ireland doesn\u2019t yet have marriage equality. I\u2019m not so interested in the queens\u2019 shock over it (I grew up in Kansas and rural Pennsylvania, so these things sadly don\u2019t surprise me), but when Blu reveals that she and her partner agreed to wait for equal marriage instead of getting a civil partnership, I started to lose it \u2014 especially given this week\u2019s news that the country has legislated marriage equality. I hope she enjoyed celebrating.\n\nAfter the runway, where the category was \u201cgenetically modified drag queens,\u201d Cheryl and Blu are both declared safe. I have to assume it\u2019s so Cheryl wouldn\u2019t feel alone while she untucked \u2014 Blu\u2019s Snatch Game performance was certainly the most interesting, and that eye felt out-of-the-box for her. She might be growing on me, can\u2019t you tell? I\u2019m thinking the Vivienne will notch a second win for her Trump based on judges\u2019 comments: she beat Baga on the runway (I\u2019d love to see a real dress and some big hair!), even if I\u2019m not getting this revolutionary performance that Ru and Michelle are fawning over. But Ru announces that they both win, and they won\u2019t even have to split the badge, because the show\u2019s prizeless budget can afford two! This, to me, is justice; Baga\u2019s performance felt the most British of the group and it would\u2019ve been a shame to leave it unrecognized.\n\nSum Ting Wong\u2019s fate as a bottom is sealed with her cheap catsuit look, but I\u2019m torn on Divina versus Crystal given both of their innovative looks. Ru deems Divina safe for her stunning flowery outfit, although I personally preferred Crystal\u2019s industrial take on the challenge \u2014 and she made sparks literally fly when she used a saw on her metal costume pieces. Guest judge Geri Halliwell (hey, Ginger Spice was the guest judge, by the way) may have been scared, but it\u2019s something I would pay money to see. Crystal and Sum Ting\u2019s lip sync to \u201cSpice Up Your Life\u201d is fairly average, though, except for the sheer spectacle of Crystal performing bubblegum pop in that outfit. And Sum Ting Wong, who should\u2019ve done Nigella Lawson anyway, sashays away.\n\nI was never really that into Sum Ting, but I did appreciate the end of this episode, when she\u2019s met backstage by Geri, her biggest fan. (\u201cI feel like Sum Ting Wong embodies Britain,\u201d she says during deliberations, to my American confusion) \u201cMaybe you can be called Sum Ting Right,\u201d Geri tells her, before pronouncing her name as Sum Ting \u201cWrong.\u201d But it\u2019s the thought that counts, and one that adorably capped the episode.\n\nAcross The Pond\n\nOne of the best moments of the episode involves Alan Carr explaining a tit shrug to Ru and Crystal. Apparently it\u2019s an English thing? \u201cDo you have that in America, tit shruggin\u2019?\u201d he asks, after seeming to do one off-camera when talking to Crystal \u2014 who has no idea what\u2019s going on. (Give her a break, she\u2019s Canadian!) \u201cDon\u2019t just make a, we do, don\u2019t make out and just leave me hanging here! Don\u2019t we?\u201d Alan pleads. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s just you, Alan.\u201d All Crystal can do is laugh and act cute.\n\nWe have got to talk more about the supposedly iconic cleaning lady Kim Woodburn, who seems to pop up every episode. By my research, she seems like if Marie Kondo acted like Wendy Williams and Judge Judy? I just want one of these queens to properly show me why they love her, and I would\u2019ve loved to see the Vivienne do her for the Snatch Game!\n\nAmong many other things that I\u2019ll just let you listen to for yourself, Blu\u2019s Mary Berry refers to her \u201cpoonanny.\u201d I can think of few more awful combinations of words than poo + nanny, so I hope we don\u2019t have to hear this one too much.", "description": "It\u2019s time for the best kind of Drag Race drama: Snatch Game drama!
