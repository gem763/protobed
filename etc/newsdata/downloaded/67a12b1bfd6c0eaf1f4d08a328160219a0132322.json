That is absolutely right.\u201d\n\nThis follows the release of a letter written to Harry Dunn's family by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.\n\nThe BBC, who have seen the letter, reported that it said: \"The US have now informed us that they too consider that immunity is no longer pertinent.\"\n\nIt reportedly added: \"We have pressed strongly for a waiver of immunity, so that justice can be done... Whilst the US government has steadfastly declined to give that waiver, that is not the end of the matter.\n\n\"We have looked at this very carefully... the UK government's position is that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs Sacoolas' case, because she has returned home.\"", "description": "Home Secretary Priti Patel remained tight-lipped on suggestions a US diplomat's wife could be extradited from the United States over the death of 19-year-old Harry Dunn in a road accident.Mr Dunn died when his motorbike crashed into a car outside an RAF base on August 27 of this year.", "authors": ["Luke O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rVVngXU9Ks_FXB_oiQJFlQ--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/a8119f78c6250a6b4016b4e44a1776bb", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
