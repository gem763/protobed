With these changes we can state we are consistent with places like Europe.\n\n'As we go East from here it will be more of a challenge but it has to be something we have to consider in the US. We own tracks in Florida and Maryland so we have started to broach those subjects.\n\nSanta Anita is playing host to the Breeders' Cup and the spotlight is on US racing\n\n'Nothing can be done unilaterally but we are discussing with horsemen how we may make these changes.\n\n'They have been very receptive but Lasix will be a sticking point. It is something we have to figure how to work together to get the right solution.'\n\nGiven the raft of US stallions that raced on Lasix, it has always seemed likely some in the breeding industry in America would oppose change.\n\nBenson added: 'There are many (US-bred) horses which go to Europe and do very well so the idea Lasix-use is bred into them and they can't race without it, does not comes out in the wash.\n\n'But we have a generation of trainers who have not trained without it. In Europe, they treat bleeders differently. Part of the reason we did not want to do a full stop on Lasix is because we have to learn how to train and race without it.'\n\nThere are 1,800 horses trained at Santa Anita. Injury and fatality rates have fallen since changes, which include use of the whip during training exercise, were introduced.\n\nIt is the 10th time the Breeders' Cup had been held at the track in the meeting's 36-year history\n\nThere will be pressure to do more including the wider replacement of the traditional US Dirt tracks with the synthetic surfaces used at Britain's All-Weather venues.\n\nBenson said her team and employers are committed to change.\n\nThe worry will be staying in control of events. A high-profile equine fatality at the Breeders' Cup which has nationwide TV coverage on the NBC channel would be potent ammunition for the sport's opponents.\n\nIn liberal California especially, pressure would become even tougher to withstand.\n\nBenson said: 'It's hard because any time a horse dies it is front-page news but the focus of this company is to make racing safe.'", "description": "MARCUS TOWNEND AT SANTA ANITA: Officials at Santa Anita hope positive changes for the good of racing in the US can emerge from the troubles the track has endured.", "authors": ["Marcus Townend For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/22/20350322-0-image-a-81_1572387849036.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
