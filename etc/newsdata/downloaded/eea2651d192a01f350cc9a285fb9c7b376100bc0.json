Storch continued to explain the long-term trend has not shifted away from retail. Consumers are embracing e-commerce at the deficit of brick-and-mortar stores and that it \u201chas nothing to do with a recession.\u201d\n\nOn Amazon\u2019s Prime Day, for example, customers purchased more than 175 million items during the course of the event in July.\n\nConsumers moving to online retailers such as Amazon have resulted in the U.S. having \u201cprobably two to three times \u2014 or even four times \u2014 as much retail square footage in terms of brick-and-mortar as\" needed, Storch said. Brick-and-mortar retail does have winners such as Walmart, Target, Costco, Dollar General, and TJ Maxx, which offer both value to customers as well as a robust online presence, he said.\n\nBut this has been a bad week for some retailers.\n\nForever 21 announced it would be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it takes \u201cpositive steps to reorganize the business,\u201d FoxBusiness.com reported. Similarly, Macy\u2019s has recently confirmed it will be selling off its landmark location in downtown Seattle in early 2020.\n\nMoody\u2019s has even gone so far as to warn of \u201cblood in the streets\u201d for brick-and-mortar retail should recession strike.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % M MACY'S INC. 15.55 +0.01 +0.06% WMT WALMART INC. 117.85 -0.83 -0.70% TGT TARGET CORP. 105.94 -0.97 -0.91% COST COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION 283.93 -4.18 -1.45% DG DOLLAR GENERAL 159.04 +0.10 +0.06% TJX TJX 55.39 -0.35 -0.63%\n\nIn an effort to address the empty spaces left in malls, mega mall owners are currently looking at investing in failing retailers. Brookfield Property and Simon Property have expressed interest in an ownership stake in Forever 21, according to the New York Post, Keeping the retailer alive could prevent hundreds of empty storefronts from plaguing Brookfield and Simon\u2019s malls.\n\nBut Storch urges caution for those property owners. Closures could persist despite their ownership, he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to own the problem, literally,\" Storch said. \"They are going to own all the stores on top of their real estate, so their problem is simply going to be multiplied.\u201d\n\nBrick-and-mortar retail business will continue to fail if their leaders don't adapt to the changing marketplace, Storch said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cThere are many people in the retail world in general who have not changed their business models to adapt to today\u2019s reality,\u201d Storch said.
