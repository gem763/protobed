Oscar! Let\u2019s go captain.\u2019\n\nIt was then Oscar was handed over by Gordon\u2019s wife Tana, as the two prepared to turn on the engine and get that baby revving (the car, not Oscar).\n\nHe continued, as Tana proudly captured the moment on her phone: \u2018Hands on the wheel at all time, indicators, check the mirror. Are we ready?\u2019\n\nIt comes after the celebrity chef admitted he fainted during the recent birth of son Oscar.\n\nGordon and wife Tana welcomed Oscar in April (Picture: PA)\n\nGordon and Tana \u2013 who also have children Megan, 21, 19-year-old twins Holly and Jack, and 17-year-old Matilda \u2013 welcomed their fifth baby on 4 April, with the chef confirming his arrival on Instagram.\n\nSharing snaps of his radiant wife cradling their son, he wrote: \u2018After 3 baftas and one Emmy\u2026 finally we have won an Oscar, please welcome Oscar James Ramsay, who touched down at 12:58 today for some lunch!\u2019\n\nThe Kitchen Nightmares star appeared on The Jonathan Ross Show and revealed that wife Tana wouldn\u2019t allow him to be in the room at the births of his four other children, but this time she made an exception.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Tana didn\u2019t want to see me there for previous births,\u2019 he told Wossy.\n\n\u2018She said, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to see me in this state so get out.\u201d This time I was there and I absolutely crapped my pants.\u2019\n\nThe chef confessed the experience was just too much for him and he collapsed upon watching his wife give birth.\n\n\u2018I fainted,\u2019 he continued. \u2018I literally dropped on the floor. I was sat there and Oscar popped out through the sunroof and then they sort of throw you on him and he\u2019s screaming and I fell back, the nurse grabbed me.\u2019\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure, that car will take your breath away all the same.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
