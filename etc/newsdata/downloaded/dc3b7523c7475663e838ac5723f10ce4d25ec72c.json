At least it seems to be the case for GOP presidential candidate Mark Sanford. He confused Arby\u2019s with Wendy\u2019s this week and Arby\u2019s corrected him in the most delicious way.\n\nStanding outside an Arby\u2019s restaurant in Iowa with a note pad and sandwich in his hands, Sanford launched into his grievances held against President Trump \u2013 where\u2019s the wall he promised? What about eliminating the debt? The premise is that Trump hasn\u2019t fulfilled his campaign promises. He asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the beef?\u201d Oops.\n\nArby\u2019s official Twitter account responded in the perfect way, with humor and gently reminding Sanford that he had the wrong fast-food chain with that famous question.\n\nSir, this is an Arby's. \u2014 Arby's (@Arbys) September 25, 2019\n\nArby\u2019s slogan is \u201cWe have the meats.\u201d The other slogan was used by Wendy\u2019s back in the 1980s. The chain admitted it had \u201ca lot of fun with this Tweet.\u201d As crazy and contentious as this week has been with the impeachmentpalooza in Washington, this is a fun way to show that disputes can be handled with good humor.\n\nThe Sanford campaign responded. No, really. They justified the error instead of owning it. Why did they have to admit it was a deliberate faux-pas? It looks better for Sanford if the blunder is unintentional. It is pretty ballsy to stand in the parking lot of one fast-food chain\u2019s restaurant and deliver an old slogan used by another fast-food chain. It makes no sense. Sanford\u2019s campaign makes no sense, either, so this is where we are.\n\nIn a statement obtained by Fox News, a spokesperson for Sanford said the governor did not mean to insult the fast-food chain. \u201cThe Governor stands by his belief in the amount of roast beef found in his beloved half-pound Beef \u2019N Cheddar from Arby\u2019s. Arby\u2019s should take the compliment! As you may know, the Beef \u2019N Cheddar combines a heavy layer of cheddar cheese sauce, roast beef and his own application of Arby\u2019s sauce to make for one of the Governor\u2019s favorite food sources. Though he means no disrespect to some of his other favorites found at Wendy\u2019s, McDonald\u2019s, and Taco Bell.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026one of the Governor\u2019s favorite food sources.\u201d This is how politicians speak. The pandering put into mentioning all the ingredients of the sandwich is interesting and then the shout-out to all the other fast-food franchises the governor enjoys is classic establishment politician. Good heavens. Think of the other franchises he left out who now think, hey, what about us? That is what happens when we go down that road.\n\nMark Sanford is running a vanity campaign with the goal of taking some revenge against President Trump for his role in Sanford\u2019s failed re-election bid. The ineptness of Sanford allowed a Democrat to win that Republican seat in South Carolina. Sanford insists he is running to spotlight his pet causes \u2013 mostly fiscal responsibility and the national debt \u2013 but he comes off whiny and misses the mark. The flub at Arby\u2019s is a perfect example of the candidate\u2019s flawed approach.\n\nSouth Carolina canceled the state\u2019s GOP primary. Sanford should cancel his half-hearted campaign and find something else to do. I hear he enjoys hiking.\n\nAddendum (Ed): Who told Sanford that recycling old Walter Mondale campaign lines would be a great idea for a 2020 GOP primary fight?", "description": "\"Sir, this is an Arby's.\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MarkSanford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
