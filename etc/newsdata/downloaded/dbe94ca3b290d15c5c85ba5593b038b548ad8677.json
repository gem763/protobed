The report, which stretched more than 100 pages, scrutinized the initiation of the Mueller probe.\n\nDespite the resources devoted to it and the hype by Giuliani and Trump allies, the document was never released. But it\u2019s still proven explosive, as one of its authors says some of its contents formed the genesis of the single biggest political crisis of Trump\u2019s turbulent presidency.\n\n\u201cThat outline that I gave to the State Department was originally prepared to be included in the counter-report,\u201d Giuliani told The Daily Beast late Thursday night. \u201cIt was prepared to provide a guide for text that could be included in the [final] counter-report.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI undertook the [Ukraine] investigation\u201d as part of a broader effort that began last year \u201cto find out how much evidence existed that could exonerate [President Trump].\u201d\n\nThat Ukraine-related investigation started as an attempt to delegitimize the Mueller probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. But, according to Giuliani, it tipped him off to the idea of getting the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, despite apparent warnings from one of the top U.S. diplomats in Ukraine that the information he was getting from Ukrainian political figures on Biden was not to be trusted. (Sekulow told The Daily Beast he did not do any investigative work involving Ukraine for Trump). The president now faces an impeachment probe sparked by a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he pressed the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens and appeared to make security aid contingent on it.\n\nImmediately after Zelensky told Trump he was interested in buying more anti-tank missiles from the U.S., Trump asked for a \u201cfavor,\u201d according to the transcript of that call. That favor was an investigation \u2013 and not just of the Bidens. \u201cAs you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance,\u201d Trump told Zelensky, \u201cbut they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it\u2019s important that you do it if that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nThe next month, according to texts from U.S. diplomats outlining efforts to push Ukraine to undermine Biden and thus boost Trump\u2019s political prospects, Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker and U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland \u2013 who had connected Giuliani with a Zelensky adviser \u2013 scrambled to get the Ukrainians to publicly commit to investigating what Sondland called \u201c2016 and Burisma,\u201d references to the origins of the Mueller investigation and to the Ukrainian natural gas firm where Trump and Giuliani, without evidence, have claimed Biden engaged in a cover-up.\n\nVolker told Congress that Giuliani insisted \u201cthe statement should include specific reference to \u2018Burisma\u2019 and \u20182016.\u2019\u201d It alarmed the Ukrainians; the texts indicate they feared being roped into domestic U.S. politics, and the statement never came.\n\nLate Thursday evening, shortly after House Democrats released those explosive text messages\u2014which appeared to further implicate the State Department in the Trump-Giuliani pressure campaign on Ukraine\u2014Giuliani said in a phone interview that months earlier, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pledged to aid the Trump attorney\u2019s quixotic Ukrainian expedition.\n\nIn March, according to Giuliani, the former New York mayor brought to Pompeo\u2019s attention a packet of information outlining some of the materials that would have been included in the counter-report that was never released by Trump\u2019s legal team. It would prove to be another fateful decision.\n\n\u201cPompeo called me up afterwards and asked, \u2018Do you have any other written material,\u2019 and\u2026I said I did,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cHe later said, \u2018Just send me over the statements from the most important witnesses.\u2019\u201d\n\nLater, Giuliani\u2014who has given versions of this account to CNN, the New York Daily News and the Wall Street Journal\u2014said Pompeo \u201cthen called me back and said he referred it, and said, \u2018We\u2019ll do an internal investigation.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/GettyMore than a year ago, Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow began working, with the president\u2019s sign-off, on a \u201ccounter-report\u201d to push back against Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
