These spots aren\u2019t to be confused with razor burn, which Lara Kaiser, an aesthetician at Brooklyn\u2019s Shen Beauty, says are two different things. \u2018Razor burn is caused by friction against the skin when the skin is not prepped well enough or the person shaved too aggressively,\u2019 she says. Razor bumps are basically ingrown hairs, which can pop up anywhere that you remove hair and often happen on more delicate areas where the hair is coarse, like the bikini line. And they can happen to anyone, no matter how you remove the hair: \u2018Razor bumps are very common and can happen no matter what your landscaping method is and how thorough it is,\u2019 assures Ania Siemieniaka, the manager and owner of Freckle, a spa in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.\n\nLuckily, there are lots of products out there that you can use before and after waxing and shaving to help prevent or eliminate irritation \u2014 including some products that you might have assumed were only for the face but are more versatile than we thought. We talked to six aestheticians and waxing experts to hear which creams, gels, and serums to reach for in the days after waxing or shaving, and other steps you can take to stave off razor bumps in the first place.\n\nBest overall product for preventing razor bumps\n\nFur Skincare Fur Oil Three of the waxing specialists named this culty product as the best for combating razor bumps. The oil, which is specifically formulated to be safe for the pubic area, blends several soothing antiseptic and antimicrobial ingredients, like grapeseed, jojoba, and tea-tree oil, which will help keep the area clean and smooth. \u2018A great way to prevent razor burn is by keeping the skin around the bikini line really healthy, like with Fur Oil,\u2019 says Kaiser. \u2018This is an oil you apply for a few days before or after hair removal that is antiseptic and helps soften hair and hair regrowth. As far as I know, it\u2019s about the only product on the market specifically for pubic hair.\u2019 Samantha Garlow, waxing specialist at Daphne, agrees. She says that while Fur Oil does carry a specific spot treatment for ingrowns, the original Fur Oil \u2018can be used daily on clean, exfoliated skin, and is safe for your most sensitive areas.\u2019 Audra Senkus, co-owner of Haven Spa, recommended the oil as well, telling us, \u2018We love Fur Oil.\u2019 She also pointed to the brand\u2019s stubble cream as a useful product to keep in the medicine cabinet. The stubble cream \u2018smooths the skin after waxing, and it also softens any prickly stubble,\u2019 she says, noting that it also \u2018prevents ingrowns and bumps.\u2019 \u00a346 at Cult Beauty Buy\n\nBest physical exfoliation products for preventing razor bumps\n\nItaly Towel Asian Exfoliating Bath Washcloth Green (4 pieces) All of the aestheticians we spoke to said that exfoliating a few days after waxing or shaving is an important step in preventing bumps as hair starts to grow in. There are many ways to exfoliate \u2014 manually with a scrubbing mitt or cleansing scrub, or with a chemical exfoliant \u2014 and choosing one comes down to personal preference. Kaiser suggests using a \u2018scrubby mitt\u2019 or dry brush. \u2018That leaves less of a chance for the hairs to curl in on themselves, and exfoliates the area so there is nothing to clog pores, making them vulnerable to bacteria and inflammation,\u2019 she says. \u2018The scrubby mitt or dry brush can be from anywhere, they\u2019re all about the same.\u2019 \u00a35 for 4 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nDr. Hauschka Cleansing Cream For those who want to exfoliate with a cleanser (or want to combine one with their scrubbing mitt), Mihoko Ninomiya, skin-care manager at Great Jones Spa, suggests using a gentle facial scrub. She likes Dr. Hauschka\u2019s Cleansing Cream, which has a \u2018grittiness close to that of a rice flour or an almond meal or powder,\u2019 the ideal texture for a scrub for more delicate areas, according to Ninomiya. \u00a313 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nCrystal Peel Microdermabrasion Exfoliating Soap Body Bar And for those who prefer bar soap, Stalina Glot, senior aesthetician at Haven, recommends Crystal Peel Microdermabrasion Exfoliating Soap Body Bar. She says you can use it in the days leading up to shaving, but to \u2018avoid doing that the same day as shaving.\u2019 \u00a328 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nCure Natural Aqua Gel Unlike the other physical exfoliants on this list, Cure Aqua Gel is made with 91 percent hydrogen water, which Winnie Zhong at oo35mm says works on the surface to remove dead skin. She says it can be used on the face and more sensitive parts of the body. \u2018You would use this after cleansing steps or on dry skin; rub the gel into the skin and it reacts to dead skin,\u2019 Zhong told us. \u00a346 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest chemical exfoliation products for preventing razor bumps\n\nAlpha Skin Care Enhanced Renewal Cream Zhong also recommends Alpha Skin Care\u2019s Renewal Body Lotion, which she calls \u2018a cult favorite.\u2019 The lotion has 12 per cent glycolic acid, which makes it ideal for improving skin texture. \u2018Many of our customers use it on keratosis pilaris and stubborn bumps,\u2019 Zhong says. \u2018It can also be good for acne scars.\u2019 (We imagine it would be good for fading any scars left from past ingrowns as well.) \u00a330 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBiologique Recherche Lotion P50 Speaking of cult exfoliants, you\u2019ve probably heard of Biologique Recherche\u2019s Lotion P50, a favorite facial toner of celebrities, beauty editors, and your skin-care-obsessed friend. The exfoliating toner can be used for more than your face, though, according to Garlow. \u2018P50 has a smart blend of proven clarifying ingredients like lactic acid, gluconolactone, salicylic acid, and sulfur, which moisturize, regulate oil, and prevent ingrown hairs,\u2019 she says. Depending on sensitivity, you can dilute P50 with water. \u2018It\u2019s best used out of the shower by pressing, not rubbing,\u2019 Garlow told us. \u2018It\u2019s recommended to use once a day and 24 hours after hair removal, and you can follow it with Fur Oil.\u2019 [Editor\u2019s Note: This product price doesn\u2019t take into account additional shipping costs.] \u00a363 at Embassy of Beauty Buy\n\nBest hair-removal-specific skin cleanser\n\nSkyn Iceland Nordic Skin Peel Another alternative to harsh wipes are Skyn Iceland\u2019s Nordic Skin Peel pads, which Siemieniaka says were designed for acneic skin but \u2018work wonders on your bikini bumps.\u2019 She told us that she learned about the pads \u2014 the perfect application format for when you\u2019re feeling a bit lazy or busy \u2014 from Katie Jane Hughes, a makeup artist. \u2018I got hooked, and after a while, I realized that it works really well on the bikini area, especially those sensitive types,\u2019 says Siemieniaka, who also notes that they won\u2019t dry out your skin. \u00a339 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nBest gels for preventing razor bumps\n\nPFB Vanish Siemieniaka also told us about PFB Vanish, which can be used with not-so-sensitive skin. \u2018Its powerful combo of glycolic, salicylic, and lactic acids will reduce inflammation, kill bacteria, and exfoliate the skin (yes, ingrown-hair prevention right there),\u2019 she says. \u2018Our clients love it.\u2019 It comes in a roll-on bottle, which makes it easy to apply. \u00a329 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nAlchimie Forever Antioxidant Skin Repair Gel Ninomiya says that this gel is designed to help prevent razor burn on the face, but that it\u2019s also effective for ingrowns anywhere else on the body. It\u2019s full of natural antioxidants like green tea and anti-inflammatory ingredients rosemary and turmeric, making it a useful product for keeping skin healthy overall. \u00a345 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nUltraluxe Women\u2019s Ingrown Hair & Razor Bump Treatment If you\u2019d rather use a formula specifically designed for women, Senkus suggests UltraLuxe\u2019s Women\u2019s Ingrown Hair treatment, which she says can be used on the face and body to stave off ingrown hairs. \u2018The technology actually cools and calms your skin post-shaving, preventing the chance of irritation before it begins.\u2019 The cooling factor comes from the ingredient allantoin, which is known for its anti-redness, anti-irritation properties. [Editor\u2019s Note: This product price doesn\u2019t take into account additional shipping costs.] \u00a323 at Ultraluxe Buy\n\nPrincereigns Ingrown Hair Eliminating Serum This one is a favorite of both Glot and Senkus. Glot suggests using it twice a day and notes that \u2018serums are designed with low molecules that penetrate to the hair follicle and remove dead skin cells, pushing the hair up.\u2019 Senkus told us that Princereigns also \u2018removes dark spots and soften and straightens curly hair while removing ingrown hairs and razor bumps.\u2019 \u00a325 at ebay Buy\n\nBest natural treatment for preventing razor bumps\n\nRadha Beauty Tea Tree Oil \u2018For natural-remedy lovers, I recommend tea-tree-oil compress,\u2019 says Siemieniaka. \u2018Tea-tree oil is extremely rich in antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties that will help you get rid of redness and itchiness caused by razor bumps.\u2019 She cautions against using tea-tree oil in its pure form and suggests mixing a couple of drops of oil with a few tablespoons of warm water instead. \u2018Then make a compress with a cotton ball and apply onto affected areas for about ten minutes. For best results, I would do this twice a day,\u2019 she says. \u00a326 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
