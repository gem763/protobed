Her dream date is someone who \u201ccan\u2019t wait to talk about the latest exhibit/concert/movie/other activity he attended.\u201d Ari Jacobson is 35 and works in early-childhood education. He is seeking someone who enjoys learning new things and expanding her horizons. (Daniele Seiss/For The Washington Post)\n\nBefore moving to Washington, Ari Jacobson made a living singing on cruise ships. He released an album (fans, his website notes, have described him as the \"male Ani DiFranco\"). Four years ago, while visiting a childhood friend and his wife here, he decided to audition for some plays. He was cast in a theatrical production of Franz Kafka's \"The Metamorphosis,\" grew to love the capital and its vibrant theater scene, and decided to stay.\n\nAri, now 35, still acts in plays and performs regularly at bars and restaurants \u2014 he has about 500 to 600 covers he can perform, a holdover from his time on cruise ships. During the day, he works at preschools and child-care centers, doing baby and toddler music classes, performing \u201cvarious forms of kids\u2019 music, Jewish music and Jewish kids\u2019 music,\u201d he says. The gigs keep him busy: An hour before his date, Ari was singing at a toddler\u2019s birthday party.\n\nHe put down the musical shakers and bid farewell to the kiddos to meet Vicky Markovitz, a 33-year-old editor for a higher-ed association, for a Labor Day date. Vicky is a poet and a big supporter of the arts \u2014 she goes to shows every week to see her favorite local bands (she gave special shout-outs to Ex Hex, Erotic Thrillers, Des Demonas and Yes Vacancy). She volunteers with Split This Rock, an organization of poet-activists in the District. Her brother is a musician, so she understands the hustle of being an artist better than most.\n\nVicky had sent in her Date Lab application because \u201cI want to show that I\u2019ve tried it all,\u201d she says. She\u2019s been on all of the dating apps. She\u2019s tried meetups. She\u2019s even done speed dating. \u201cI can\u2019t recommend that,\u201d she says, laughing. Putting herself out there for dates that don\u2019t end up working can be discouraging, but she tries to stay open to new experiences. Meanwhile, Ari applied because some of his close friends are loyal readers of this column and even read them aloud using different voices for the daters. \u201cMy biggest fear was: Don\u2019t do something that will make [them] read me in a funny voice,\u201d Ari says.\n\n\n\nVicky and Ari. (Daniele Seiss/For The Washington Post)\n\nAri and Vicky met at Ankara in Dupont Circle and shared the bottomless mezze. They compared notes on their travels. They talked about the theater productions Ari has been involved in and the plays Vicky has seen. He was fascinated to hear that she had worked on an archaeological dig in Peru in grad school. They discussed the challenges of having a career in music. They both really enjoyed the colossal grilled shrimp.\n\nBut while they had plenty to talk about, there was one major difference between them. It had to do with their approaches to dating. \u201cIt can be a little hard to feel chemistry right away,\u201d Vicky says. \u201cWhat I usually use for my judgment is if I had a good time and I enjoyed the conversation, to see if someone is interested in a second date, and not even focus on long-term anything \u2014 just stay in the moment.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked what he was looking for, Ari said that he couldn\u2019t describe exactly what it was \u2014 and then proceeded to give a very detailed description of what he was looking for. It\u2019s that ineffable combination of mutual attraction, reciprocity and compatibility. \u201cYou know within the first 30 seconds of meeting someone whether they\u2019re a candidate or whether there\u2019s potential,\u201d he says.\n\nUnfortunately, Ari says he realized within the first 30 seconds that the sparks weren\u2019t going to fly between them. So at the end of the night, when she asked if he wanted her number, he told her the truth: He didn\u2019t see a romantic connection developing. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s to be super upfront about that,\u201d he says. The lesson he has taken from being on the other side of rejection is that \u201c \u2018no\u2019 is so much kinder than \u2018maybe,\u2019 for both sides.\u201d\n\nVicky took it well. \u201cHe said that actually he didn\u2019t feel a romantic vibe, but I\u2019m really glad he was honest,\u201d she says. She wasn\u2019t necessarily feeling it either, but she was still open to getting to know him further. Still, she\u2019d rather take the truth than a brushoff: \u201cI 100 percent supported the honesty.\u201d And though the date ended anticlimactically \u2014 they hugged and no numbers were exchanged \u2014 she counted it as a success. \u201cMy things were just hoping I\u2019d meet someone, get along and enjoy some free food together,\u201d she says. \u201cThat definitely happened.\u201d\n\nRate the date\n\nVicky: 4 [out of 5]. \u201cThat special something was missing, but that you can\u2019t really control.\u201d\n\nAri: 3. \u201cDefinitely on the positive side, but for a 4 or 5 you\u2019re hoping it will lead to some future romance.\u201d\n\nUpdate\n\nNo further contact.\n\nMarin Cogan is a writer, senior producer, and co-host for Pop-Up Magazine.\n\nMore from Date Lab:\n\nBefore the date, she did a little online sleuthing\n\nHis dream date is with \u2018a Southern belle wedding planner that knows her way around the kitchen\u2019\n\nDate Lab 2.0: Four new writers dig deeper to find out how the dates really went\n\nApply now to Date Lab", "description": "He was looking for a combination of mutual attraction, reciprocity and compatibility.", "authors": ["Marin Cogan", "Marin Cogan Is A Writer", "Senior Producer", "Co-Host For Pop Up Magazine."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yZ8sou4UyOZT5Mwd7vzdNONDp-Y=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5U4NBUWQCYI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
