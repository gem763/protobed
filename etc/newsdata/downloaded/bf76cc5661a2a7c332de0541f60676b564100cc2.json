The life support system is back in a lab in Houston,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want systems that allow our astronauts to be scientists on the surface of the moon\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration in March directed NASA to land humans on the moon by 2024, accelerating a goal to colonize the moon as a staging ground for eventual missions to Mars.\n\nOne suit of orange fabric will be worn by astronauts when inside the spacecraft. Astronauts will wear a much bigger mostly white suit on the lunar surface.\n\nThe new suits make it much easier to walk, bend and squat when walking on the lunar surface, Amy Ross, NASA\u2019s lead spacesuit engineer, said.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\n\u201cBasically, my job is to take a basketball, shape it like a human, keep them alive in a harsh environment, and give them the mobility to do their job,\u201d she said.\n\nThe new suits come as a much-needed upgrade to NASA\u2019s astronaut wardrobe. Astronauts Christina Koch and Anne McClain were slated in March to conduct the first ever all-female spacewalk outside the International Space Station, but the mission was called off because there weren\u2019t enough spacesuits available on the station for both of them.\n\nAnother attempt for the first all-female spacewalk, a roughly six-hour crawl on the exterior of the space station to install new batteries, is back on for Thursday, NASA said in a news release on Tuesday.", "description": "NASA on Tuesday showed off two new spacesuits tailored for future moonwalking astronauts, signalling development of a crucial component to the space agency's accelerated drive to return to the moon by 2024.", "authors": ["Joey Roulette", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441279353&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E22P", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
