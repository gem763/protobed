REUTERS/Florence Lo\n\nFormally, the plenum is to discuss improving governance and \u201cperfecting\u201d the country\u2019s socialist system, but during the four days of talks other topics are bound to be raised as well.\n\nWHAT IS A PLENUM?\n\nThe meeting is the fourth time that China\u2019s roughly 370-person Central Committee has gathered since the 2017 party congress, which ushered in President Xi Jinping\u2019s second five-year term in office as party and military chief.\n\nThe Central Committee is the largest of the party\u2019s top decision-making bodies, and its plenums typically take place once a year.\n\nTo prevent leaks, plenum attendees are traditionally confined to the venue for the duration of the meeting.\n\nLittle, if any, news of the proceedings is made public until it closes. Foreign media and most Chinese reporters are given no access.\n\nOn the day the plenum ends, the official Xinhua news agency will issue a long dispatch with details of what was agreed to. To portray party unity, there will be no mention of any disagreements.\n\nPast plenums have been held under tight security at the Soviet-era Jingxi Hotel in western Beijing.\n\nThere has been an unusually long gap since the last plenum in February 2018. They normally happen in the autumn, but one did not take place then last year amid speculation about disagreement over policy among the senior leadership.\n\nHOW SIGNIFICANT ARE PLENUMS?\n\nAfter party congresses, which are held once every five years, they are the most important gathering of the senior leadership in one place.\n\nThe mood at plenums can vary greatly, depending on the agenda. A watershed conclave in 1978 overseen by Deng Xiaoping kickstarted China\u2019s economic reforms, beginning the transformation of the world\u2019s most populous nation from a centrally planned backwater to an economic powerhouse.\n\nAt the plenum in February 2018, the party approved a plan to remove presidential terms limits, meaning Xi could stay in office until he dies. That change was formally signed off on in last year\u2019s meeting of China\u2019s largely rubber stamp parliament.\n\nAt a plenum in 2013, China unwrapped its boldest set of economic and social reforms in nearly three decades, relaxing its one-child policy and further freeing up markets to put the world\u2019s second-largest economy on a more stable footing.", "description": "The elite Central Committee of China's ruling Communist Party will hold a closed-door meeting from Monday to Thursday to set the major policies for the year ahead and beyond, and probably discuss crises ranging from Hong Kong to the trade war with Washington.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445660358&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R005", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
