The pilot will mark the first time a major tech company has made drone deliveries to homes in the US.\n\nWing CEO James Ryan Burgess told reporters on a conference call Thursday the test will help it improve the service and build relationships with communities. Wing has not said how many deliveries it will make per day, or how many of Christiansburg's 22,505 residents will be eligible. Interested customers must live in select areas and can sign up on Wing's website.\n\nThe company said it selected the town because it's worked closely with the Mid-Atlantic Aviation partnership at nearby Virginia Tech, which is part of an FAA program to ease drones into the skies safely.\n\nRead More", "description": "Drone deliveries are finally coming to the United States in a very limited way.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190919130807-01-wing-alphabet-drone-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
