And joining Brian in the studio to discuss all four games is former England hooker George Chuter.\n\nEngland were first to impress with a comfortable win over Australia on Saturday morning. Next up it was the All Blacks who handed a thrashing to Ireland later the same day.\n\nNew Zealand - the pre-tournament favourites - look like they could be peaking at just the right time, but was it a case of Kiwi brilliance or did Ireland simply fail to turn up?\n\nThe Irish now go into a transitional phase as head coach Joe Schmidt departs his role after six years in charge. Former Ireland hooker Shane Byrne offers his thoughts on whether Schmidt's last year in charge has tainted his otherwise excellent legacy.\n\nWales became the third team to qualify for the semis on Sunday morning. They defeated France by a solitary point, and not without controversy. Referee Jaco Peyper made headlines on and off the pitch following his decision to justifiably red card Sebastien Vahaamahina in the first half.", "description": "We're down to just four in the 2019 Rugby World Cup after last weekend's quarter-finals.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Ben Coles", "Paul Hayward", "Mick Cleary"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/u2NNQPYEGSk/mqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
