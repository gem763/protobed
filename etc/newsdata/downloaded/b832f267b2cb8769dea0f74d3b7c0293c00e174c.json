The Federal Reserve will report the final numbers today.\n\nThat would bring the total amount of consumer credit in the U.S. to $4.1 trillion. That might sound like a big number, and it is a new record. But here\u2019s the thing: Consumer debt hasn\u2019t grown very much\u2014 at least when compared with debt in other parts of the economy, like the federal government. Or, take the corporate sector as another example: companies have almost $10 billion worth of debt.\n\nAnalysts Expects a 18 Cents Loss Per Share for GameStop\n\n\u2014when the company reports earnings on Tuesday. The video-game retailer has been struggling as gamers gravitate toward streaming. Its stock is down 66% so far in 2019, and the company\u2019s first-quarter profits missed Wall Street\u2019s forecasts.\n\nBut bears beware: Michael Burry is optimistic about the company. He\u2019s the investor made famous by the book and movie \u201cThe Big Short\u201d for betting against subprime mortgages before the financial crisis. He says GameStop stock has fallen too far, since most stores have good cash flow.\n\nThe U.S. Inflation Rate is Expected to be 2.3%\n\n\u2014according to economist forecasts. If those estimates are correct, that will mean inflation was pretty steady in August. This figure, by the way, excludes the cost of gasoline and energy, which can be volatile month to month.\n\nThe takeaway here is that inflation just isn\u2019t that high. Because of that, the Federal Reserve probably has some room to cut interest rates later this month, as the market expects.\n\nNumbers by Barron\u2019s is our daily podcast.
