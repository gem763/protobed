They claimed responsibility for two major suicide bombings in the capital Kabul.\n\nTrump's surprise announcement left in doubt the future of a draft peace accord worked out last week by Zalmay Khalilzad, the special U.S. envoy for peace in Afghanistan.\n\nUnder the draft some 5,000 U.S. troops would be withdrawn over the coming months in exchange for guarantees Afghanistan would not be used as a base for militant attacks on the United States and its allies.\n\nA full peace agreement to end more than 18 years of war would depend on \"intra-Afghan\" talks involving officials and civil society leaders as well as further agreement on issues including the remainder of the roughly 14,000-strong U.S. forces as well as thousands of other NATO troops.\n\n\n\n\n\nCIVIL WAR\n\nThe Taliban's strategy of fresh assaults appears to be based on the assumption that battlefield success would strengthen their hand in future negotiations with U.S and Afghan officials.\n\nSome of their field commanders have also said they are determined not to surrender gains when they are close to victory, suggesting the leadership is under internal pressure not to concede a ceasefire.\n\nThe warring sides have held nine rounds of peace talks in Qatar's capital city Doha aimed at ending America's longest war, which began with a U.S. invasion triggered by the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in New York, that al Qaeda launched from then Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.\n\nNine former U.S. ambassadors last week had warned that Afghanistan could collapse in a \"total civil war\" if Trump withdraws all U.S. forces before the Kabul government and the Taliban conclude a peace settlement.\n\nTrump said on Saturday that he had also planned to meet with Afghanistan's president, who has been sidelined from the talks.", "description": "The Taliban on Sunday said U.S. President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to cancel peace talks would lead to fresh losses to American lives in Afghanistan at a time when the insurgent group was ready to finalise a deal to end the war.
