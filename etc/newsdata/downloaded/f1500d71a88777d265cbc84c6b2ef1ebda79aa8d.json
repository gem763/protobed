And the celebs chosen this year include Lorna Maseko, Kwesta and Suzelle DIY.\n\nMake sure you support your celeb in their quest to achieve SA\u2019s most loved pizza and give to the Red Cross Children's Hospital & Trust in the process.\n\nCelebrities were asked to design their own pizzas. Lorna's pizza is a heart-healthy wonder, ideal for the lactose-intolerant or resistant, while Kwesta made a super meaty pizza. My personal favourite was Suzelle DIY's as it was Greek-inspired. She calls it the 'Spanakopizza', all the ingredients of a spanakopita, but on a pizza base. That is, cheese, spinach, spring onions and some phyllo pastry shards to finish. SO. YUMMY!\n\nREAD: This Hout Bay pizzeria was just named the best in Africa - but there's even more to them than pizza\n\nOrder your favourite from 27 September to 30 November on Mr D or at any Col'Cacchio's restaurant as R5 of each celeb pizza ordered will be donated to the Red Cross Children's Hospital & Trust. PLUS stand a chance to WIN a 7 Night, 5 Star Luxury European River Cruise. You also stand a chance of winning one of our exclusive celeb-signed pizza boxes when ordering through Mr D!.\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
