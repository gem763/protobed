In thirty-eight states, the governor appoints members of the state commission tasked with regulating energy companies. That incentivizes energy companies to fund their campaigns. In Florida, for example, utility companies gave over $1 million to then-Governor Rick Scott and PACs working to re-elect him\u2014during just one election year. In Virginia, because the legislature appoints the commission, Dominion has historically given consistent donations to the members of the legislative committees that appoint commissioners and evaluate energy-related bills. Clean energy advocates argue that the millions of dollars that utility companies spend on state political races are relatively modest investments considering the billions that favorable regulation delivers those companies and their shareholders. For example, states guarantee utility companies a steady return on the physical assets that they own, which partially explains why utilities are always eager to build more plants and pipelines. In Dominion Energy\u2019s case, Virginia guarantees the company a 9.2 percent return on equity, and the company has asked that the state commission raise that to 10.75 percent, to subsidize its new gas pipelines, which will cost billions.\n\nIn recent years, with the emergence of alternative forms of energy, utility companies have had more incentive to buy favor on the state level\u2014and some of them have made brazen attempts to squash perceived threats to their monopoly from third-party solar companies and other forms of clean energy. Energy industry political groups have formed advocacy groups with names like Consumers for Smart Solar\u2014an innocuous-sounding group that drew intense scrutiny in 2016 when the Miami Herald procured a recording of a utility company-supported think tank director detailing how the industry aims to \u201cuse the language of promoting solar\u201d to actually defeat initiatives that would allow for more renewable energy. At the time, utility companies were backing an amendment in Florida whose \u201cgoal,\u201d they claimed \u201cwas to expand solar generation,\u201d but which the Herald reported could have served \u201cas a legal barrier to raise fees on solar users and keep out companies that want to compete with the utilities to provide solar energy generation.\u201d\n\n\u201cDominion essentially is the gatekeeper when it comes to state-level energy policy.\u201d\n\nMore specifically in the Virginia case, as a top political donor, \u201cDominion essentially is the gatekeeper when it comes to state-level energy policy,\u201d Gilmore argues. Their influence plays out in multiple ways. First, leadership in the Virginia assembly has consistently killed bills\u2014like those incentivizing renewable energy or requiring new emissions standards\u2014that could threaten Dominion\u2019s monopoly status. \u201cIt\u2019s not just what the legislature has done on Dominion\u2019s behalf but what it has failed to do,\u201d Pomerantz told me. Unlike in many other states, in Virginia energy companies are not required to meet any renewable energy goal. Virginia is currently ranked 37th in terms of renewable energy production, despite advocates saying the state is particularly well-positioned for solar, hydro and wind power. Instead, as climate scientists urge than we have less than a decade to dramatically reduce carbon emissions to avoid catastrophe, Dominion plans to lower its carbon emissions at a rate of roughly 1 percent per year between now and 2030\u2014a slower rate than it decarbonized between 2005 and 2017, according to the Energy and Policy Institute. That unhurried pace fits an alarming national pattern. Data culled from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that carbon emissions from the U.S. energy sector increased by 1.9 percent from 2017 to 2018, largely because energy companies expanded their natural gas projects.\n\nDominion is among those lobbying for more gas drilling. The company is awaiting permission to build the Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP), a 600-mile gas pipeline that would run underground in Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina. Construction on the pipeline is currently suspended as lawsuits wind through the courts, and the project has met with strong local opposition, including from Native American groups who object to the pipeline running through ancestral land and burial grounds. As with other pipeline debates, the ACP\u2019s planned route has raised environmental justice concerns from those who believe utility company money is being valued above the concerns of voters with less to give: \u201cI do believe that this location was selected because we are African Americans,\u201d one Union Hill resident told Energy News Network in August.\n\nThis legislative session, Virginia Delegate Lee Ware, a Republican representing the 65th District, sponsored a bill that would have required Dominion to demonstrate that they would not be passing the costs of such building projects on to their electricity customers. The ACP is projected to cost $7 billion. The Virginia Senate committee that ultimately killed Ware\u2019s bill was led by Senator Frank Wagner, who has received $114,485 from Dominion Energy. Wagner also chaired the committee that appointed the newest member of the commission responsible for regulating Dominion.\n\nSuch conflicts of interest are not outliers. If anything, clean energy advocates cite Ware\u2019s bill as atypical because it advanced at all. Energy companies shape state energy policy by giving money but also by wielding expertise: Establishing electricity rates and carbon standards involves technical minutia, and state lawmakers are rarely elected with granular knowledge about energy policy. Each legislative session, those lawmakers have to consider hundreds of bills on wide-ranging topics from Medicaid to highway repairs, so they often rely on lobbyists to break down information. Dominion deploys a fleet of lobbyists at the national level, in Washington, and at the state level, in Richmond, and in other state capitals. To fill the gap in information about energy policy that doesn\u2019t come directly from within the industry, Clean Virginia has started a research arm which will aim to inform lawmakers.\n\nClean Virginia has also joined a statewide coalition, Virginia Energy Reform Coalition, that includes strange bedfellows, including Freedom Works, the conservative and libertarian advocacy group. True believers in the free market have good reason to oppose the current government-regulated energy model, which breeds inefficiencies by protecting individual companies\u2019 artificial monopolies. And many potential ways to address the climate crisis fall in line with traditional Republican economic values. Hernandez says that during his tenure in the Obama administration Republican governors often supported their renewable energy efforts because they brought jobs to their states. State lawmakers squashing bills that would promote clean energy is \u201canti-business, anti-jobs,\u201d Hernandez says, because they prohibited new energy industries from proliferating in the state. He echoed an idea shared by many others calling for energy policy reform: \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be partisan.\u201d\n\nThe ramifications for lawmakers failing to rein in Dominion and other monopoly utilities\u2014across the country and over decades\u2014are manifold. It is difficult to move through an ordinary day while also holding in mind what rising temperatures mean on a global scale. Virginians are already feeling the economic consequences of the climate crisis. Hernandez\u2019s district is on the Virginia coast, where the sea level is rising faster than anywhere else on the east coast. Increasing costs of flood insurance are already a concern for people he has met while knocking on doors. \u201cThis is a pocketbook issue for families,\u201d he said. Dominion\u2019s influence also extends beyond the climate crisis. Virginia\u2019s State Corporation Commission found that in 2018 Dominion earned $277.3 million more than allowed by the rate set by the state. But a law Dominion lobbied for prohibits customers from being reimbursed. And according to Clean Virginia, Dominion\u2019s new capital spending will increase customers\u2019 bills by nearly $400 per year.* \u201cThere are people being evicted in Virginia, which has one of the highest eviction rates in the country in certain of our communities, for failure to meet their utility bills,\u201d Gilmore said.\n\nThe ripple effects of corporate donors like Dominion steering legislative agendas also have far-ranging consequences for other political battles. Massive political spending by utility companies has kept incumbent Republicans and conservative Democrats in charge in statehouses across the country. For years that has meant not only regressive environmental policies but also no Medicaid expansion, no gun reform, no increases in education spending, and more. The incumbents\u2019 control over election districts then perpetuated these trends. This November, Clean Virginia\u2019s supporters say, could be the moment that signals what will be possible in the state, and for campaign finance and climate change activists nationwide. Virginia has \u201ctremendous potential\u201d if the right changes are made, Hernandez told me. \u201cI would be so proud if in the coming years we could emerge as a center of excellence for resilience and clean energy. It will take work to get there, but I can see that future.\u201d\n\n\n\n* This article misstated Rodman\u2019s teaching position, and has been updated to clarify the reason for a predicted increase in Dominion customers\u2019 bills.", "description": "Virginia's Dominion Energy gives generously to candidates to get what it wants.
