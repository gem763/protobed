which is based in the city of Kathua - said that thousands of hectares of Indian farmland now sit untouched on the other side of the fence.\n\nTechnically, farmers can still get to their land, but the checkpoints in the fence are opened only during specific times of day and farmers have to walk for hours to reach their fields, explained Bharat Bhushan Sharma, the committee's vice president.\n\nEven if they do manage to successfully cultivate their crops, \"there is always a threat of cross-border fire\", said Sharma, who is also head of Bobiya village.\n\n\"And then [they] can't protect their crops from wild animals.\"\n\nCommittee president Nanak Chand, 87, said he lost almost 20 acres (eight hectares) of land to the fence when it was first built in 2004.\n\n\"Three months ago, the military acquired the remaining two hectares (five acres) of farmland as well,\" he said. \"I am landless now.\"\n\nChand was given 3,000,000 rupees ($42,300) as compensation, which he says is not enough to buy himself an equivalent piece of land in a peaceful part of the country.\n\nKhajuria agreed, saying that \"with developers and businessmen from other states rushing to Jammu and Kashmir, land prices are likely to soar and it would make it difficult for poor border residents to buy land in peaceful areas\".\n\nIn December 2018, Chand filed a petition with the Jammu and Kashmir High Court on behalf of farmers living in the border areas of the affected districts.\n\nThe petition called for the government to pay rent for farmland on the Pakistan side of the fence and provide farmers with compensation for each crop season during which their land remains uncultivated.\n\nThe MHA, BSF and the local administration have not yet filed their responses, according to lawyers representing the farmers.\n\nJugal Kishore Sharma, a member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party who represents the Jammu-Poonch parliamentary constituency, could not specify how much of the land along the border currently being used by the military is farmland.\n\nBut he said officials in the border districts are in the process of measuring that amount.\n\n\"Thereafter, the government will start paying rent to farmers,\" he said in a phone interview.", "description": "After India revoked autonomy of Kashmir, farmers in border areas fear losing even more of their land to the military.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/5257907600c34bf0bb3cef90d041d436_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
