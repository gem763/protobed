This event is particularly important for me. Before participating in the run for the first time 10 years ago, I struggled to finish a 10km race, so I will be thrilled if I manage to finish on Sunday. I joined the first Unicef Charity Run to challenge myself to take part in a 15km race. And I did it. Without the Unicef Charity Run, I would not gone on to take part in the various marathons around the world that I have done.\n\nAfter signing up for the event, I realised that the proceeds from Unicef\u2019s Charity Run will be used to help Unicef\u2019s work against HIV/Aids across the world, especially the prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Stopping children from getting HIV from their infected mothers is the first milestone for ensuring they live a healthy life. My friends and colleagues also realise how important this cause is, and with their support, we raised HK$155,000 in one year alone.\n\nSince then, fundraising for Unicef has become a tradition for our company. Every year, my colleagues are always asking me for details on how they can help long before I have started promoting it. Some colleagues even join me in running for Unicef. With the passion and enthusiasm of my colleagues and friends, we have raised HK$2.5 million in the past nine years.\n\nI was asked to share some \u201ctips\u201d on donation appeal, but I don\u2019t think money is the most important part. Rather than asking someone to donate HK$1 million, I would rather one million people donated HK$1. To help Unicef achieve their goals, we need to raise awareness of the issues, and encourage as much global support as possible. Every runner is a messenger. Other than asking my colleagues to donate, I also send emails and share Charity Run news on my Facebook to encourage more friends to support Unicef\u2019s work on HIV/Aids.\n\nEven though a marathon is a long way to run, I feel really satisfied when I march closer to the finishing line step by step. That\u2019s the same with the Aids to Zero programme. Eliminating Aids seems like an impossible dream, but we are making progress every day through Unicef\u2019s work on HIV/Aids worldwide.\n\nI was the only one from my office to take part in the Charity Run in that first year. But now, I have more than 20 colleagues joining me.\n\nTo find out more about Unicef\u2019s Aids to Zero campaign and how you can donate, please visit https://www.unicef.org.hk/aidstozero/index.phtml?lang=en", "description": "Time flies, and the 10th anniversary of Unicef's Charity Run is fast approaching.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/mr._ling_2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
