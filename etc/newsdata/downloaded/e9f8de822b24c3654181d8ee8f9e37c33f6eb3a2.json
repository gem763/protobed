I was waiting for your response then I was going to tell you I hated it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as Shane tells the makeup mogul that they should have opted for a triangular design for the palette, Jeffree admits he was \u2018shocked\u2019 that he originally chose a rectangular design \u2013 which the two agreed would not help to sell the palette.\n\n\u2018When you picked this, I was actually a little shocked, weeks ago,\u2019 Jeffree went on to say.\n\n\u2018I thought it should be something crazier, but I don\u2019t want to push.\u2019\n\nThe two were eventually able to come to a resolution over the palette design (Picture: YouTube)\n\nTo which Shane replied: \u2018Oh, push me off a f*****g cliff. Literally, we know each other so well now, you can be like, \u201cthat\u2019s bad.\u201d\u2019\n\nLater on, we see Jeffree looking pretty stressed as he admits he wish he had spoken up earlier about the design of the pyramid box, as he stated they were down to \u2018the f*****g wire\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u2018I\u2019m like mad because I should have pushed for the pyramid earlier. I\u2019m just glad it\u2019s not, like, too late and we have to sell something we don\u2019t wanna do, I\u2019d rather just not do it and push it.\u2019\n\nHowever, Shane didn\u2019t have the nicest thing to say back, as things got heated around the 40-minute mark.\n\n\u2018Literally, next time spit in my face,\u2019 he replied. \u2018Just say, \u201cYou\u2019re stupid.\u201d\u2019\n\nHowever, tensions between the two eventually cooled down as we could later see them laughing and joking among each other, as Jeffree apologises to Shane, saying: \u2018I\u2019ll never hesitate again, sir.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll in all, the duo was able to come to a resolution, and as well as an eyeshadow palette \u2013 the mini \u2018Controversy\u2019 palette and lipstick box set also got approved, with fans being given a sneak peak of the final designs with the custom logos stamped onto them.\n\nAnd the two revealed toward the end of the video that they agreed on a final palette design they are both proud of \u2013 and it is set to be revealed in Shane\u2019s next YouTube video.\n\nShane Dawson and Jeffree Star\u2019s Conspiracy Collection goes on sale on 1 November.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
