The first is being withdrawn and a more cautious tone will be adopted.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s energy crisis threatens to break the economy. If there really is a plan it needs not only to be technically and political sound, but well communicated too.\n\nOtherwise many in government may be consulting Jannie Mouton\u2019s biography for inspiration before long, the one titled \"And then they fired me\".\n\nBruce Whitfield is a multi-platform award-winning financial journalist and broadcaster.\n\n\n\n\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Bruce Whitfield:", "description": "Gwede Mantashe needs to get a little paranoid.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7922/005e8565a6dc47a3b43956c5534c71ad.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
