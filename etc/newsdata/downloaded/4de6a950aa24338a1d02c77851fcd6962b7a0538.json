It was a hollow boast, bearing in mind he was sacked by Livingstone\n\nMcDonnell himself has compared his GLC role in the early Eighties to that of UK chancellor \u2014 and the Mail\u2019s dossier provides disturbing evidence of his approach to taxpayer funds.\n\nMost worryingly it poses very serious questions about how he might behave if he ever were in charge of the nation\u2019s finances should a Corbyn Labour be elected to power.\n\nIn the documents, both Livingstone and senior GLC civil servant Reg Race directly accuse McDonnell of ordering that papers which set out the council\u2019s true financial position be \u2018shredded\u2019.\n\nLivingstone, pictured with McDonnell left, said McDonnell repeatedly assured him that the claim of \u00a3140 million in cuts was accurate \u2014 only to discover the truth a week before the GLC was due to vote on its budget\n\nA former GLC official, who witnessed many of the events detailed in the confidential reports, told the Mail: \u2018This man must never be allowed in charge of public finances.\u2019\n\nAt the time \u2014 between 1984 and 1985 \u2014 McDonnell was a labour councillor in the capital campaigning to defy the Thatcher Government\u2019s plans to limit local authority spending and he was threatening to \u2018go illegal\u2019 by refusing to set a budget.\n\nIn a note to Ken Livingstone in October 1984, shortly after he was appointed deputy leader, McDonnell stated: \u2018The whole point of our administration is that we are a challenge to the centralist capitalist state.\u2019\n\nThe lifelong class warrior, who has put as \u2018fermenting [sic] the overthrow of capitalism\u2019 as his hobby for his Who\u2019s Who entry, is still on the same mission more than 30 years later.\n\nPeppered in his speeches today are references to \u2018Tory cuts\u2019. One of his favourite soundbites is: \u2018Austerity is not an economic necessity, it\u2019s a political choice.\u2019\n\nBack in the Eighties, he described the so-called \u2018rate-cap rebellion\u2019 by the GLC and other mainly Left-wing councils against the Tory government as an opportunity to open a \u2018second front\u2019 alongside the miners\u2019 strike to bring down Thatcher.\n\nAs part of the campaign, McDonnell repeatedly claimed the Tory proposals would mean \u00a3140 million worth of cuts and huge job losses in London.\n\nThe lifelong class warrior, who has put as \u2018fermenting [sic] the overthrow of capitalism\u2019 as his hobby for his Who\u2019s Who entry, is still on the same mission more than 30 years later\n\nIn fact, GLC officials calculated that government spending limits would result in a gain of \u00a325 million \u2014 and that the GLC was \u2018awash\u2019 with cash that had previously been budgeted and unspent under McDonnell\u2019s watch as Head of the Finance Committee.\n\nBut he reacted with \u2018cold fury\u2019 when confronted with the details by Race and fellow senior civil servant Peter Brayshaw in his County Hall office across the river Thames from the Houses of Parliament and ordered them to destroy their findings.\n\nRace, now aged 72, and Brayshaw \u2014 who died in 2014 \u2014 were so appalled by McDonnell\u2019s behaviour they refused to work with him.\n\nIn a memo marked Private and Confidential, from Reg Race to Livingstone, dated March 13, 1985, Race warns that it was by then impossible for himself and Brayshaw, then assistant Director General of the GLC, to engage with McDonnell.\n\n\u2018Whatever the political considerations might be, it would be pretty impossible for Peter Brayshaw and myself to work on a continuing basis with John McDonnell,\u2019 said Race.\n\n\u2018Working relationships were never good, now they are non-existent; and I, for one, am not prepared to advise a Member on policy only to have that advice shredded or denounced in public at party functions.\u2019\n\nLivingstone, now 74, himself wrote an excoriating 15-page confidential report to the GLC Executive Committee in which he accused his former close ally of lying, mismanaging the council\u2019s budget, and failing to respond to concerns raised by officials.\n\n\u2018The weekly meeting to discuss the Budget was often cancelled, and important issues were not raised. Papers on Budget Options .. . were not discussed and John McDonnell ordered that the papers be shredded,\u2019 Livingstone reported. \u2018Reg Race wrote three times to John McDonnell to resolve these issues. No reply was received.\u2019\n\nMcDonnell himself has compared his GLC role in the early Eighties to that of UK chancellor \u2014 and the Mail\u2019s dossier provides disturbing evidence of his approach to taxpayer funds. He is pictured with Ken Livingstone above\n\nLivingstone accused McDonnell of failing to publish a public budget consultation and said: \u2018I can only conclude that John McDonnell does not want an open debate about the true financial position.\u2019\n\nLivingstone said McDonnell repeatedly assured him that the claim of \u00a3140 million in cuts was accurate \u2014 only to discover the truth a week before the GLC was due to vote on its budget.\n\nIt must have been quite an achievement to be lectured on financial responsibility by \u2018Red Ken\u2019 Livingstone!\n\nThe row split the Labour group, with McDonnell leading a group of ten hard-left rebels.\n\nLivingstone\u2019s confidential report continued: \u2018In the late afternoon of Thursday, February 28, Reg Race asked to see me in order to voice his fears that the paper to be published the following day was not in line with party policy and the state of our finances was such that instead of facing \u00a3140 million of cuts we could have \u00a325 million of growth.\u2019\n\nLivingstone, who sacked McDonnell because of his behaviour, said the bombshell wrecked his plans to defy the Thatcher Government and led to GLC members voting for a budget even lower than that proposed by the Tories.\n\n\u2018Many felt that we had been misled and manoeuvred into an unreal position and it would be hard to maintain credibility when the true facts became known,\u2019 he complained. In a direct attack on McDonnell, he concluded: \u2018We need to remember that those who control access to information have a duty to share that openly with the rest of the movement.\n\nBack in the Eighties, he described the so-called \u2018rate-cap rebellion\u2019 by the GLC and other mainly Left-wing councils against the Tory government as an opportunity to open a \u2018second front\u2019 alongside the miners\u2019 strike to bring down Thatcher\n\n\u2018Hiding the real position about the council\u2019s finances did not change the facts and simply made it more embarrassing when the truth was known.\n\n\u2018Telling the public that government policies will lead to immediate massive cuts creates real problems for the credibility of the party when those cuts don\u2019t happen.\u2019 Another internal report obtained by the Mail was written by John Carr, then a GLC member for Hackney Central, who blamed McDonnell for the rate-capping \u2018debacle\u2019 and described the \u2018anger, confusion, suspicion and feeling of betrayal\u2019 caused by his actions.\n\nCarr was also furious that \u2014 for all his claims of supporting the working class \u2014 McDonnell\u2019s disastrous strategy ultimately led to less money being provided to channel to vital services, including education in London.\n\nHe blasted: \u2018The trade unions and the wider public had been repeatedly told . . . that the (Government) rate cap meant cuts of \u00a3140million.\n\n\u2018In propaganda of various sorts and at public meetings all over London, GLC Members had been describing the horrendous job and services losses, and losses to community groups, that would follow if the rate cap stood.\n\n\u2018In the event, at the Labour Group on March 4 (1985), the Chair of the Finance and General Purposes Committee, John McDonnell, finally revealed that cuts of only \u00a330 million would be required to meet the rate cap.\n\n\u2018However, it then also emerged that John McDonnell had been consistently refusing to work with Reg Race, Head of the Programme Office, to compute an alternative basis for the budget which could not only protect 100 per cent of all existing budgets but also fund \u00a323 million of growth.\u2019\n\nHe went on: \u2018Many otherwise sympathetic comrades on the Labour Group did feel that important and relevant information was being deliberately withheld from them. Worse, they felt that they were being lied to or manipulated or both.\n\n\u2018In the end, we managed to snatch a defeat out of the jaws of victory. I hope that I have managed to convey a sense of the anger, confusion, suspicion and feeling of betrayal that descended upon the great majority of the Labour Group . . . that . . . night.\u2019\n\nCarr concluded that vital financial help to underprivileged London boroughs \u2014 some of the poorest in the country \u2014 has been \u2018greatly jeopardised\u2019 as a result of McDonnell\u2019s tactics and that it would be \u2018much harder\u2019 to help the cash-strapped Inner London Education Authority.\n\nCarr, who is married to a former health minister in Gordon Brown\u2019s government, has left politics and now works as a charity web consultant.\n\nA former senior GLC official, who does not want to be named as he fears a backlash from McDonnell loyalists, was scathing in his denunciation of the shadow chancellor\u2019s record.\n\nHe said: \u2018He was deliberately lying to Londoners and the Labour movement, knowing that his cuts argument was wrong. The question arises: if he is prepared to behave in such a way, what would he do in respect of the national finances if he were Chancellor?\u2019\n\nThe source, who witnessed many of the confrontations first-hand, said McDonnell reacted with \u2018cold fury\u2019 when told by civil servants that his claims about Tory cuts were bogus.\n\n\u2018McDonnell had a nice office overlooking Westminster. Race and Brayshaw went to see him and told him that, while he was saying they would have to make \u00a3140 million worth of cuts, you have all these reserves and the Capital Fund you can use. You don\u2019t have to make any cuts at all.\n\n\u2018McDonnell couldn\u2019t argue because the evidence was robust. He was just terribly angry that he had been caught out.\n\n\u2018He didn\u2019t shout, he didn\u2019t swear, he didn\u2019t wave his arms about. It was just very controlled anger. Finally he just said \u201cdestroy this document \u2014 don\u2019t show it to anybody\u201d. It was just extraordinary.\n\n\u2018After that time, trust had completely dissipated. McDonnell wasn\u2019t capable of being spoken to.\u2019\n\nThe source added: \u2018McDonnell had just invented his claims about the levels of cuts. He hadn\u2019t got any information at all \u2014 he had absolutely no basis whatsoever.\n\nIn the documents, both Livingstone and senior GLC civil servant Reg Race directly accuse McDonnell of ordering that papers which set out the council\u2019s true financial position be \u2018shredded\u2019 [File photo]\n\n\u2018He had a very clear policy of supporting the National Union of Mineworkers. The phrase \u201csecond front\u201d was used all the time. The strategy was bring down the Tory government, full stop. They thought they would create the most enormous crisis for the Government but it was completely foolish. I put it down to naivety and revolutionary zeal.\u2019\n\nThe source said GLC officials were also appalled by McDonnell\u2019s management of the day-to-day finances of Europe\u2019s largest city council.\n\n\u2018There was roughly a 60 per cent underspend of the revenue. Revenue that was expensively, provocatively and outrageously \u2014 as far as the Press was concerned \u2014 demanded from GLC ratepayers was sitting there in the bank doing b****r all. That was wrong on both levels, for the ratepayers and for the council. It just couldn\u2019t go on like that.\u2019\n\nFor his part, a spokesperson for John McDonnell told the Mail this week: \u2018This is completely untrue and bears no relationship to reality. These reports were prepared to justify the betrayal of the rate-capping campaign by some GLC councillors and a political adviser.\n\n\u2018All the budget reports presented to the Greater London Council by John McDonnell were prepared and signed off by the GLC\u2019s finance officers, lawyers and Director General for their accuracy and probity.\u2019\n\nUndaunted, today, McDonnell hopes to take charge of the country\u2019s \u00a3810 billion-plus national budget. Significantly, when asked on his first morning as Shadow Chancellor about his suitability for the job, he said he was \u2018chancellor of the exchequer for London at the age of 29\u2019.\n\nIt was a hollow boast, bearing in mind he was sacked by Livingstone. Indeed, McDonnell was considered Red Ken\u2019s most dangerous rival within the GLC Labour group.\n\nTo McDonnell, his boss was too \u2018middle of the road\u2019. It was McDonnell, not Livingstone, who suggested that the GLC Labour Group hold open talks with the IRA in the week that a nail bomb at Chelsea Barracks had killed two pedestrians.\n\nIn three disastrous years as chairman of the finance committee, McDonnell took London to the brink of ruin\n\nLivingstone wrote about the rate-capping dispute in his book You Can\u2019t Say That and recalled that when he found out about McDonnell\u2019s bogus budget, he told him: \u2018We\u2019re going to look like the biggest f***ing liars since Goebbels.\u2019", "description": "John McDonnell himself has compared his GLC role in the early Eighties to that of UK chancellor - and the Mail's dossier provides disturbing evidence of his approach to taxpayer funds.", "authors": ["Bill Akass", "Richard Pendlebury For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/00/19907220-0-image-a-23_1571442444540.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
