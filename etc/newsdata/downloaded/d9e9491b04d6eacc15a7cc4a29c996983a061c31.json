How can they keep making excuses for him?\n\n(Image: W8media max coopey)\n\n\"They should have made him face up to the mistakes he has made.\"\n\nMr Shackley's daughter Danielle, 31, said: \"Coopey is basically sat there laughing at us.\n\n\"We cannot rest and we cannot grieve. We are not getting any justice at all and we are not being treated properly.\n\n\"How can you get behind the wheel of a car while you are high on drugs, kill two people and not go to prison for it?\"\n\n(Image: Dan Holland/INS News Agency Ltd)\n\nMr Imi's widow, Sarah, added: \"As we try to rebuild our lives, we are reminded that this boy just does not care about anyone but himself.\n\n\"His parents are both serving police officers, as yet there is no decency in either of them - not once have they attempted to apologise for our loss.\"\n\nApproached for comment, Coopey\u2019s mum told the Mail on Sunday: \"We don\u2019t do trial by newspaper.\"\n\nIn a statement, the family later said: \"Our sympathy is with the families of Mr John Shackley and Mr Jason Imi following the tragic accident.\"\n\nThe report which absolved Cooper was compiled by Adrian White, a police collision investigator.\n\nHowever Coopey, who said \"no comment\" in a police interview, could still end up being charged over causing the men's deaths.\n\n(Image: Dan Holland/INS News Agency Ltd)\n\nNow 18 he spoke about the crash for the first time at an inquest into the men's deaths in July in Reading.\n\nLawyers for the families say his account of the crash means he may have been speeding so the case should be reopened.\n\nCoopey said he had his dipped headlights on as he approached a blind dip in a completely straight, 800 metre stretch of the 50mph zone road.\n\nHe told how he saw Mr Imi and Mr Shackley as he reached the top of the blind summit and they started crossing to the Royal Berkshire Hotel, where they were staying while on a work trip.\n\n(Image: INS News Desk/INS News Agency Ltd)\n\nHe said: \"I can't see past the dip. I see two figures when I am at the top of this dip. Just before the hotel. Two figures just before the hotel opposite.\n\n\"I first braked when they were on the pavement because they are looking out on the road as if they are going to cross.\n\n\"They started across, They were fast walking. They continued towards the middle of the road, started panicking.\n\n\"I continued braking, throughout the whole time, from the time I saw them on the kerb until the time I stopped, my foot was slammed down the whole time.\n\n\"They got to about halfway and I was very close, I do not know but it looked like they were panicking from my view, they continued quickly, tried to make it. One of them went in front, the other followed him, behind him.\n\n\"From my point of view, it looked like they were panicking and quickly tried to run across the crossing and quickly get across.\"\n\nA spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: \"A review of the statements made by Max Coopey during the inquest into the deaths of Jason Imi and John Shackley is currently being undertaken.\"\n\nCoopey has a string of previous convictions dating back to when he was 12 years old including common assault, robbery and drugs.", "description": "Max Coopey, whose parents are both serving Met Police officers, ploughed into John Shackley, 61, and 48-year-old Jason Imi with his dad's Audi A5 while he was high on cannabis in Sunningdale, Berkshire", "authors": ["Lorraine King", "Image", "Ins News Desk Ins News Agency Ltd", "Ins Picture Desk Ins News Agency Ltd", "Max Coopey", "Dan Holland Ins News Agency Ltd"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20735993.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Police-review-drug-driver-teen-who-killed-two-and-walked-free.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
