The shooter was arrested.\n\nRamil Shamsutdinov, 20, has been identified locally as the Russian soldier who shot eight of his comrades dead after opening fire at a Siberian military base\n\nShamsutdinov reportedly targeted his captain first - shooting at the heads of the victims before finishing off any wounded with 'control shots'\n\nThe ministry added that the shooting is believed to be the result of 'a nervous breakdown caused by personal circumstances not related to military service.'\n\nThe soldier, a conscript, had been serving at the remote base for just four months before opening fire, local media reported.\n\nWitnesses said he attacked the captain first, aiming for the heads of his comrades and finishing them off with 'control shots'.\n\nThe dead includes one captain, one senior lieutenant and at least five privates, according to Russian reports.\n\nAfter the shooting the solider ran into the nearby neighbourhood, causing shops to close in panic and children were sent home from school.\n\nTwo wounded soldiers have been taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, the Russian Defence Ministry said (file image)\n\nThe shooting happened around 6.20pm local time during the changing of the guard at a military base in Siberia after the man suffered an apparent nervous breakdown\n\nHe was detained in a joint police and army operation and immediately claimed he 'didn't regret anything'.\n\nIt is believed the base houses the 3rd missile brigade of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, formed in December 2016.\n\nA deputy defence minister was heading to the base to conduct an investigation.\n\nShootings and other violent incidents plagued the Russian military in the 1990s and early 2000s when it suffered from desperate cash shortages and low morale.\n\nThey have become relatively rare in recent years as conditions in the military have improved.", "description": "Ramil Shamsutdinov, 20, has been identified in Russia media as the soldier who opened fire at a remote military base in Siberia, killing his captain and seven other comrades before being arrested.", "authors": ["Will Stewart In Moscow For Mailonline", "Chris Pleasance", "Sophie Tanno For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/16/20185486-0-image-a-73_1572015651715.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
