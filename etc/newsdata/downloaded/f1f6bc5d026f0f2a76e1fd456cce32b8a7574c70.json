DFAT would not comment further on the three cases due to privacy reasons, and would not confirm whether the cases were related.\n\nAccording to a report by Australian state broadcaster ABC, one of the three is a British-Australian woman who has been behind bars for almost a year. The other two are a couple -- a British-Australian woman and her Australian boyfriend -- who were arrested in the past few months.\n\nThe arrests come amid tensions between Iran and United States and its allies, including Australia. Since the decision by US President Donald Trump in 2018 to abandon the Iran nuclear deal , Washington has attempted to use what it calls \"maximum pressure\" to change Iran's behavior and limit its nuclear ambitions.\n\nEarlier this year, tensions between the US and Iran soared to levels that prompted fears of a war. Oil prices jumped as investors feared that attacks on oil tankers risked a disruption of shipments in the Strait of Hormuz, which passes by Iran and is the most important place on the planet to the global supply of oil.\n\nLast month, Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the country's defense force would work alongside the US and the United Kingdom on a maritime security mission in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nJUST WATCHED Bolton: Iranian oil tanker is now off the coast of Syria Replay More Videos ...

Border areas with Afghanistan and Iraq are under the highest \"do not travel\" advisory.\n\nThis is a developing story.", "description": "Three Australians have been detained in Iran, Australian authorities confirmed on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Julia Hollingsworth", "Sarah Faidell"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190911003037-iran-flag-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
