Intel Corp, Nvidia Corp, Western Digital and Seagate Technology fell between 1% and 3.6%, while Ambarella Inc declined 8.6%.\n\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor index dropped 2%, while the technology index slipped 1%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was also weighed down by a 1% fall in shares of Boeing Co.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported friction between the United States and Europe could further delay efforts to resume flights of the planemaker's best-selling 737 MAX jets, which have been grounded since early 2019. Separately, Boeing said it delivered half the number of planes in the first nine months of 2019 than it did in the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 229.90 points, or 0.87%, at 26,248.12, the S&P 500 was down 31.94 points, or 1.09%, at 2,906.85. The S&P 500 and Dow indexes fell below their 100-day moving average.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite was down 88.97 points, or 1.12%, at 7,867.33.\n\nDespite the day's declines, the indexes were trading above last week's lows, when a contraction in U.S. manufacturing and a dismal reading on business activity sparked fears of a looming recession in the world's biggest economy.\n\nWhile moderate jobs growth in September lifted sentiment on Friday, traders still see an 84% chance of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by a quarter percentage point in October, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\nThose bets were bolstered on Tuesday by data that showed U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in September.\n\nInvestors will now focus on third-quarter earnings season beginning next week and analysts expect the worst quarterly profit performance since 2016, with earnings from S&P 500 companies declining nearly 3% from a year earlier, based on IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nU.S.-listed Chinese stocks declined, with Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com Inc and Baidu Inc falling between 1% and 3%.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 3.23-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 3.43-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded three new 52-week highs and 20 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded nine new highs and 121 new lows.
