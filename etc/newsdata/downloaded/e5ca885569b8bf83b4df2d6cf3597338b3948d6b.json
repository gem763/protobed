It stated: \"We're giving you a 30-day free trial of Amazon Prime! Starting with this order.\u201c\n\nThe ASA said the option to continue without signing up was small, faint and significantly less prominent than the option to subscribe. It was also placed in a position which could easily be missed by consumers, the ASA said.\n\nBy contrast, Amazon gave users two prominent options to sign up to Prime.\n\nThe ASA said the way these were presented could have misled people into thinking these were the only two choices, with one being the option not to sign up.\n\nIn fact, by clicking on either option, shoppers were agreeing to trial the Prime service, with \u00a37.99 automatically debited from a bank account each month after the end of a 30-day trial.\n\nSmall print at the bottom of the page stated: \u201cBy signing up you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the Amazon Prime Terms and Conditions and authorise us to charge your credit card after your 30-day free trial.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
