Following the announcement, it was reported that CNN will not be renewing her contract when it ends in November, according to Buzzfeed News.\n\n\u201cCNN has a right to tap or drop contributors at any point. None of us is entitled to a contract renewal,\" Johnson said, however her tone shifted on social media days later.\n\nIn response to Buzzfeed's story, which the reporter Matt Berman posted on Twitter, CNN spokesman Matt Dornic tweeted Wednesday, \"This framing is misleading. Eliana is still a CNN contrib & will remain one through Nov. We signed her because, as you put it, 'she was a top White House reporter' who was 'breaking significant news.' She\u2019s now pursuing a different career path and off that beat. Simple as that.\"\n\nThis framing is misleading. Eliana is still a CNN contrib & will remain one through Nov.

I\u2019ll still be in the news-breaking business. And perhaps even covering the White House.\"\n\nJohnson expounded on those remarks, telling the Washington Examiner, \"CNN is free to add or drop contributors without explanation and they were under no obligation to provide one for declining to renew my contract. But I take exception to a network spokesman characterizing my move from beat reporter at POLITICO to editor-in-chief of the Washington Free Beacon, as a decision to pursue 'a different career path.' I assure you that at the Beacon, as at POLITICO, I'll be in the news-breaking business.\"\n\nI didn\u2019t realize becoming the first female editor-in-chief of a conservative news site was \u201cpursing a different career path.\u201d I\u2019ll still be in the newsbreaking business.
