Getty\n\nMarc Guehi \u2013 Chelsea\n\nThe Ivory Coast-born defender has had to be patient at Chelsea. Guehi joined the club at the age of seven, gradually working his way up the youth ranks and performing consistently at each level.\n\nThe 19-year-old was a key player in Chelsea\u2019s treble-winning Under-18 campaign in 2016/17, and captained England at Under-17 level.\n\nExpect Guehi, despite his youth, to be an assured and composed presence at the back should he feature against Grimsby.\n\nCharlie Brown \u2013 Chelsea\n\nIt has been a long wait for a senior debut for 20-year-old Brown, who joined Chelsea from Ipswich in 2016. The young striker has been prolific at youth level, hitting 11 goals in the Uefa Youth League last season.\n\nAnd he has shown glimpses of his ability to step up to the senior game, too, scoring five times in the Football League Trophy over the last year.\n\nBrown will hope to get on the scoresheet if given an opportunity against Grismby.\n\nMason Greenwood \u2013 Manchester United\n\nThere are plenty of Manchester United fans arguing in favour of a regular place in the first team for 17-year-old Greenwood, a precocious talent who has impressed in his handful of senior appearances for the club so far.\n\nOne of those was in the Europa League last week, and Greenwood certainly took advantage of the opportunity. As United grew more and more frustrated against a stubborn Astana side, the teenager popped up to slot home the winning goal.\n\nMore of the same will be expected of Greenwood against Rochdale on Wednesday evening.\n\nAngel Gomes \u2013 Manchester United\n\nLike Greenwood, Gomes caught the eye against Astana last week. A diminutive, mercurial attacking midfielder, the 19-year-old looks ready to step up to the first team and provide Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with an alternative creative option.\n\nAnd the Carabao Cup could be the perfect competition for the teenager to continue his promising development.\n\nJames Garner \u2013 Manchester United\n\nUnited are not blessed with an abundance of options in midfield, so it would not be entirely surprising if Solskjaer turns to 18-year-old Garner at some point this season.\n\nHe has already featured for the first team, making a brief cameo as a substitute in a Premier League victory over Crystal Palace in February. And he has impressed with his range of passing and composure on the ball.\n\nGarner has captained England\u2019s Under-17s, too, so a start against Rochdale is unlikely to prove too daunting.\n\nCurtis Jones \u2013 Liverpool\n\nJones has been on the radar of most Liverpool fans for some time now. The 18-year-old signed his first professional contract with the club in February last year, but has since struggled to break into the first team with any regularity.\n\nBut he will be given an opportunity to impress when Liverpool face MK Dons on Wednesday night. The left-sided winger is not short of talent, and he will hope that a positive performance gets him closer to Jurgen Klopp\u2019s Premier League plans.\n\nRhian Brewster \u2013 Liverpool\n\nThere will be plenty of interest at Stadium MK in the performance of a certain 19-year-old, who has been made to wait longer than expected for his competitive Liverpool debut.\n\nBrewster has been repeatedly set back by ankle and knee injuries, curtailing the progress of a youngster who looked set for big things after scoring six goals at the 2017 Under-17 World Cup. But he is now fully recovered, and set to start against MK Dons.\n\n\u201cKlopp spoke to me and told me, \u2018You\u2019re going to get your chance this year\u2019,\u201d Brewster told the Mirror. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for that chance now so that I can prove him right.\u201d\n\nHarvey Elliott \u2013 Liverpool\n\nThis time last year, Elliott was breaking records for Fulham. At 15 years and 174 days old, he became the youngest ever player to feature in the Carabao Cup.\n\nAnd when he takes to the pitch against MK Dons, the teenager will be the second youngest player in Liverpool\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cSome players, they play as if they are already say 28 or 29,\u201d said Liverpool assistant Pep Lijnders of Elliott. \u201cHe\u2019s a player who sees so much around him before things happen.\n\n\u201cHe is a talented boy. I don\u2019t want to put him under more pressure, but we\u2019re really happy he is with us.\u201d\n\nNathan Holland \u2013 West Ham\n\nWest Ham could hand a start to 21-year-old Holland when they head to Oxford United on Wednesday night.\n\nThe midfielder has been a standout performer for the Hammers\u2019 Under-23 side \u2013 scoring once and providing two assists against Middlesbrough on Friday night \u2013 and is considered the most talented player to have come from West Ham\u2019s academy in recent years.", "description": "The Carabao Cup, in its early stages, gives the Premier League\u2019s top clubs an opportunity to hand valuable first-team experience to their up and coming youngsters.
