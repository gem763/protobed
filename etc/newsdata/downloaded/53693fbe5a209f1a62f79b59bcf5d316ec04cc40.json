Earlier in that month thousands gathered to make their voices heard on gender-based violence and femicide, asking #AmINext, and saying #EnoughIsEnough. These protesters demanded that President Cyril Ramaphosa speak to them and introduce special measures to address the rising levels of violence.\n\nMarches also occurred focusing on the xenophobic violence that rocked the country recently. The activism prompted the president to convene a special joint sitting of Parliament, where he noted that there was a \u201cdark and heavy shadow across our land\u201d because levels of gender-based violence and femicide were incredibly high. He said public violence directed against foreign nationals and South Africans \u201cexposed not only the levels of intolerance in our society but also the extent to which so many of our people are frustrated about their social and economic conditions\u201d.\n\nXenophobia, or Afrophobia as some have called it, occurs in a context in which more than 2 million foreign tourists came through our ports of entry in July this year.\n\nOn the surface, #ClimateStrike, #AmINext and #EnoughIsEnough are not connected. When we talk about the climate crisis and xenophobia, we often do so as though all people are affected equally. We forget to talk about race, class and gender and the way they influence vulnerability to these issues, and their effects.\n\nWhen we talk about the climate crisis, we talk about big business, big industry and government. We forget to talk about the women who are already facing these issues head-on and leading initiatives to address climate crisis, but who will be hardest hit as it deepens. When we talk about xenophobia, we often hear stereotypical harmful narratives of male foreigners coming to take male South African jobs, and stories of looting, vandalism and male violence.\n\nacknowledging the links between the climate crisis and xenophobia\n\nYet, over the past few months, I have also been at public events where I\u2019ve heard South African women say things such as foreign women \u201ccome and trick men just to get married and have a passport, then they run away\u201d and that \u201cwomen are coming over the border to just have their babies so that they get a South African passport\u201d.\n\nWe must tackle these harmful ideas head-on, and the time for these discussions is right now. An essential part of this is acknowledging the links between the climate crisis and xenophobia. According to the World Economic Forum, the climate crisis and the economic and environmental crises that follow, will require more women to migrate or force them to become climate refugees. The climate crisis makes the world a less safe place for people to live.\n\nAs a result, many more people are likely to migrate voluntarily, seeking better economic opportunities, political stability or freedom from violence. While the impact of the climate crisis is undoubtedly and undeniably negative, the effect of migration for women can be positive or negative.\n\nIn 2015, when the number of refugees was at its highest levels since World War 2, almost half (48%) of those refugees were women. Women migrate as much as men, but migration is more likely to be an empowering process for women if they are both individually and socially supported.\n\nwhen in transit, women and girls are more at risk of sexual violence and being trafficked\n\nLast year, the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) report Gender and Migration in South Africa: Talking to Women Migrants, showed that when women make the decision to migrate it can reduce their exposure to poverty and improve their life opportunities. Similarly, for some LGBTIQ persons, going to a country with more liberal laws can make it safer for them to live out their gender identity. Migration can thus increase access to opportunities and enhance dignity.\n\nThe climate crisis makes it more likely that people will migrate, and in this process women are affected differently from men. For example, a recent Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) report, Women on the Move: Migration, gender equality, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, showed that when in transit, women and girls are more at risk of sexual violence and being trafficked. Where the climate emergency causes droughts or floods, women are likely to have to travel further to collect water or undertake subsistence farming.\n\nIn addition, where patriarchal norms persist, the decision to migrate may not be taken by the women, but by their husbands, partners, brothers or fathers. The ISS and SDC note that when women travel across borders, even when they are highly skilled workers, they are relegated to unskilled and vulnerable working conditions that further isolate them and make them vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nIn addition, they note that foreign nationals face xenophobia from government officials and ordinary citizens.\n\nREAD: Time to plan cities with women in mind\n\nReliefWeb notes that where climate disasters occur, this also affects women\u2019s ability to access sexual and reproductive health services. Where women are irregular migrants or asylum seekers, they can be less likely to access the basic services that our Constitution entitles them to because of fear or stigma. This vulnerability is exacerbated by South Africa\u2019s backlog in processing applications for asylum, and the small number of asylum seekers who are granted refugee status.\n\n\n\nIn a country like ours, where gender-based violence is a daily risk for women, this economic and social vulnerability increases the likelihood that migrant women will experience gender-based violence. In fact the women the ISS spoke to said that this was what they were most afraid of. Like gender-based violence, harmful myths about \u201cothers\u201d encourage and promote violence against foreign nationals in the country. Like the climate crisis, we can no longer deny that it is our responsibility to turn these stories around.\n\nWe can no longer afford to talk about the climate crisis and xenophobia without taking gender into account. Both the ISS and the SDC suggest a few solutions that South Africa could implement:\n\nThe need for gender mainstreaming of migration policy;\n\nThe gender-disaggregation of migration data;\n\nThe broadening and expansion of the asylum system; and\n\nRecognising the development potential of migrant women and how they can contribute to the economy.\n\nAddressing the gendered impact of our migration policies and practices make it more likely that we\u2019ll achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and less likely that violence will happen. It\u2019s essential, and we must do it now.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The links between gender-based violence, xenophobia and the climate crisis might not be so obvious, but their impact is far-reaching.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smout"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9493/a849d3d7c2b9404a806466ccc2a1d918.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
