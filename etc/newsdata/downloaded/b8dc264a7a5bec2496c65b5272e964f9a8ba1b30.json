Nikada / Getty Images\n\nEconomists are forecasting an economic downturn on the horizon in the U.S. One major indicator is that the wealthy are cutting back on their spending on luxury goods, from cars to art to real estate. In New York City, for instance, one in four new luxury apartments remains unsold, for a total of about 4,100 high-end condos sitting empty.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a chance of there being a recession next year\u2014it\u2019s not a low risk, it\u2019s a very tangible risk,\u201d said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist with Redfin. \u201cPeople should be thinking through the worst-case scenario and make sure they have an emergency fund.\u201d\n\n\n\nGiven these concerns, buyers at the high end may find it makes sense to take out a mortgage, even if they currently have the cash for a purchase on hand.\n\n\n\nMortgage interest rates are at a three-year low, and economists predict they will drop even further by the end of the year. The affordability of borrowing makes financing a home purchase a smart strategy for wealthy buyers who want to protect their savings in the event of a recession.\n\nMore: For Foreign House Hunters in London, the Time to Act Is Now\n\nOther buyers at the high-end may opt for a mortgage because they plan to invest their wealth elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\u201cBuyers are taking out mortgages because their money can make them more money elsewhere,\u201d said Shari Scharfer Rollins, a broker with Douglas Elliman in New York. \u201cWith interest rates so low, and no anticipation of them rising, they can earn money from other investments.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen deciding whether to borrow, buyers must consider what their plans are for their home purchase, factoring in whether it will be a primary or secondary residence or an investment property, what type of mortgage would be the best fit, and which tax deductions they could take.\n\n\n\nThey must also weigh the risks of buying now, and look at which markets could be hardest hit should a recession come to pass.\n\nStill, experts say, there are rewards that come from taking a chance at a time like this.\n\n\n\nMore: Whisper Listings Can Mean Deals to Buyers, but Most Benefits Go to the Seller\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare to hear a story about someone buying an apartment at the height of the market and making a lot of money,\u201d said Elizabeth Ann Stribling-Kivlan, senior managing director of real estate at Compass in New York. \u201cFortunes are made when no one else is willing to take the risk.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarket Indicators of a Looming Economic Downturn\n\n\n\nMany Americans are concerned that an economic downturn is imminent; according to a recent Gallup poll, 49% of respondents predicted a recession in the coming year.\n\n\n\nBut broadly speaking, the economy is strong, with indicators like consumer spending on the rise in recent months.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe U.S. economy is driven by consumer spending, and based on that, consumer optimism is high, with Americans spending more on things like cars and vacations,\u201d said George Ratiu, senior economist for realtor.com. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong demand for housing, employment is solid, and wages are going up. The economy is on very solid footing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe recession concerns are originating in the financial sector, where investor confidence is waning amid the Federal Reserve taking actions like cutting interest rates and pumping money into overnight markets. Wealthy buyers, who tend to follow these fluctuations closely, are responding in kind, which is bringing luxury consumption down.\n\nFrom Penta: 'Devolved Parliament' Sets a Record for Banksy\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing central banks taking strong steps toward an accommodating policy, with low interest rates,\u201d Mr. Ratiu said. \u201cLuxury buyers are responding quickly to perceived changes, and I do see a slowdown at the upper end of the market. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, and the horizon is getting cloudy.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother indicator worrying investors is the inversion of the bond yield curve, a shift that has come before every recession since 1955. A survey of American CFOs found that two-thirds expect a recession by the end of next year.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn this instance, the luxury market is a good reflection of what\u2019s happening in the finance market,\u201d Ms. Fairweather said. \u201cThe luxury market has started to slow down, relative to more affordable homes.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut these jitters in the financial sector could benefit home buyers interested in taking out a mortgage and instead investing some of their cash elsewhere, or keeping some liquidity free.\n\nMore: Rising Rents, Wary Buyers Means Now Might Be the Time to Buy an Investment Property\n\nWhen Taking Out a Mortgage Makes Sense\n\n\n\nLuxury buyers who are deciding between paying cash up front for a home and taking out a mortgage must weigh a number of factors, including their plans for the property, the tax incentives of financing, and the market in which they\u2019re buying.\n\n\n\nJust as important is the question of how they might invest their cash if they don\u2019t put it into a home.\n\n\n\n\u201cThink about whether you\u2019re going to need that money or not if a recession happens,\u201d Ms. Fairweather said. \u201cDo you think your job could be at risk? If you\u2019re paid in stock, could your compensation go down if the stock goes down? If yes, keep the cash on hand and don\u2019t put it into a home.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor many buyers, it\u2019s about calculating where their money is likeliest to grow. According to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, the growth of average national home prices have slowed, showing no increase from June to July; in the luxury sector, the average price of a home recently fell by 1.6%.\n\nMore: For a Safer Bet in a Tough Luxury Market, Consider the Penthouse\n\nGiven the lack of strong appreciation of real estate, taking out a mortgage and investing elsewhere\u2014like stocks or treasuries could be a smart move.\n\n\n\nAnother compelling reason to opt for a mortgage is the currently low interest rates. Today\u2019s interest rates\u2014particularly a five-year ARM, which has an average 3.49% interest rate, down from 3.92% last year\u2014are favorable to buyers who intend to hold onto a new home purchase for several years.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re planning to stay five to seven years, assuming your income remains the same, it could make sense to get a mortgage because there\u2019s a low interest rate that\u2019s not likely to go up,\u201d Mr. Ratiu said. \u201cYou have the option of taking the cash on hand and investing it in some income or dividend-producing investments.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, he pointed out, some buyers prefer the peace of mind that in the event of a recession, their homes are paid off and they\u2019re only responsible for property taxes and maintenance costs.\n\nMore: Amid Political Changes, Buyers Would Be Wise to Consider Prime Central London\n\nAnother consideration is whether buyers are planning to purchase a primary or secondary residence, or an investment property.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you think you\u2019re going to stay in the home long-term, there\u2019s a better argument for putting money into the home,\u201d Ms. Fairweather said. \u201cYou have a guaranteed promise of not paying the interest on a mortgage every month.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuyers should keep in mind that they can take a mortgage interest tax deduction on a loan up to $750,000 for a primary residence; for an investment property, they\u2019re entitled to a mortgage interest deduction as well as potential deductions on rental income, property depreciation, and more.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re buying as an investment, it pays to take financing,\u201d Ms. Cohn said. \u201cThe mortgage interest deduction is that much more valuable.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore: Forget Perfectly Timing the Market and Focus on What You Can Do Instead\n\nExperts predict that some markets will be much harder hit than others in the next recession. Miami and San Diego, for instance, face a higher risk of a housing downturn, according to Redfin. Home prices in these markets are more volatile relative to other cities and there is more investor activity, putting pressure on local homeowners to take out bigger loans.\n\nThis means buyers have to decide whether they will risk purchasing in these areas at all. Those who are making a long-term investment are much likelier to see it pay off, even if a recession does come to pass.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of what\u2019s the most important thing to you. Are you trying to grow some cash, or preserve it?\u201d Ms. Stribling-Kivlan said. \u201cEspecially in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, there\u2019s going to be a point where you just can\u2019t build anymore, and homeowners hold onto things. If you look at the great real estate wealth made in this country, it\u2019s families holding onto properties for generations.\u201d\n\nClick for More In-Depth Analysis of Luxury Lifestyle News\ufeff", "description": "", "authors": ["Alanna Schubach"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-114457?size=1.4988290398126465&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
