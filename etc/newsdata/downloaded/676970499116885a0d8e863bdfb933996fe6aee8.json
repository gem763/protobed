Cooler air slipping into the area gets help from increasing high- and mid-level clouds today. Dorian should be safely veering out to sea on Friday, far enough away that we should see no more than a few passing showers and moderately gusty breezes. Clear sailing then through the weekend.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device.
