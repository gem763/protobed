(Photo: Getty Images) More\n\nAngelina Jolie\u2019s father Jon Voight attended the Hollywood premiere of Disney\u2019s Maleficent and flattered President Trump, predicting his re-election.\n\nThe 80-year-old Academy Award winner attended the September 30th event at El Capitan Theatre, and according to The Hollywood Reporter, reflected on political strains and criticized the Democratic party. (On September 24, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi instigated a formal impeachment inquiry, an initial investigation into whether President Trump has committed \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big supporter of our president, and I feel that what has happened with the Democratic party is something that I\u2019d never thought I\u2019d see happen,\u201d Voight told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cThis is not the Democratic party of John Kennedy, who I was in support of. They had many heroes in the Democratic party. They have no heroes today. There\u2019s a lot of slander and name-calling and lying that\u2019s going on and passing itself off as news. This is my opinion. That\u2019s where I stand and I don\u2019t like it. Somebody has to stand up and say that and punch back at that nonsense. This is not America. The Democratic party doesn\u2019t represent America anymore.\u201d\n\nThe actor also suggested that a Hollywood blacklist was an attack on Trump supporters and members of the Republican party. In August, Will & Grace stars Debra Messing and Eric McCormack demanded that the guest of a Beverly Hills fundraiser be released, tweeting a news link from The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cPlease print a list of all attendees please. The public has a right to know,\u201d Messing tweeted.\n\nAnd McCormack tweeted, \u201cHey, @THR, kindly report on everyone attending this event, so the rest of us can be clear about who we don\u2019t wanna work with. Thx.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease print a list of all attendees please. The public has a right to know. https://t.co/YV4UoxrPHI \u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) August 31, 2019\n\nHey, @THR, kindly report on everyone attending this event, so the rest of us can be clear about who we don\u2019t wanna work with. Thx. https://t.co/7W3xPG3bI2 \u2014 Eric McCormack (@EricMcCormack) August 30, 2019\n\nThe president tweeted a snide remark about Messing and The View co-host Whoopi Goldberg, said on-air in part, \"....Your idea of who you don\u2019t want to work with is your personal business. Do not encourage people to print out lists because the next list that comes out, your name will be on, and then people will be coming after you!\"\n\nAt the Maleficent premiere, Vought enthusiastically predicted the outcome of the 2020 election. \u201cDonald Trump is going to win the presidency once again and this is going to be proven to be nonsense just as the two years with [the Mueller Report] and millions of dollars wasted and has taken those people in the House who are Democrats away from doing the business of the people,\u201d he added.\n\nIn August, Voight recorded a Twitter video saying in part, \u201c...President Trump is a man of truths, love and justice for the American people...\u201d He also said, ...\u201dLet us pray for this country that President Trump will take on four more years of his strength, devotion, knowledge of truths.\u201d\n\nVoight and Jolie have reportedly struggled with their relationship \u2014 when Jolie was 2-years-old, Voight and her mother Marcheline Bertrand separated, reported E! News, and their bond has been inconsistent. After Jolie and Brad Pitt initiated divorce proceedings in 2016, Voight and his daughter reportedly got closer. In May 2017, Voight was spotted having a sushi dinner with Jolie and four of her children, reported E! News.\n\nLavishing compliments onto his daughter, Voight told The Hollywood Reporter, \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful for me to spend time with Angie. Any five minutes I get, I\u2019m always appreciative, so this is great that I could come and hang out with her a little bit \u2014 and the kids, too.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
