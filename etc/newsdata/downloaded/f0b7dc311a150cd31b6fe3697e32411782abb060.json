That is despite legislation passed by MPs last month known, as the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit.\n\nOn Monday night, the Spectator published texts from a Downing Street source, who claimed if the deal \"dies in the next few days, then it won't be revived\".\n\nThe government has not denied the briefing, which also said Mr Johnson \"will do all sorts of things to scupper a delay\" to leaving the EU.\n\nEarlier, the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was a growing expectation in government Brexit talks would fail before the week was out.\n\n'Obstructive' strategy\n\nAfter presenting the plans to the EU, government sources hoped the UK might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of negotiations almost immediately, with the aim of coming to a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October.\n\nBut a government source told the BBC the UK was not willing to move away from the principle of providing a consent mechanism for Northern Ireland or the plan for leaving the customs union.\n\nAnd if the EU does not accept these principles, \"that will be that\" and the plan moving forward would be an \"obstructive\" strategy towards the EU.\n\nThe No 10 said the call between Mr Johnson and Ms Merkel was a \"clarifying moment\", adding: \"Talks in Brussels are close to breaking down, despite the fact that the UK has moved a long way.\"\n\nWhat are the PM's border plans?\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images\n\nUnder Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a \"broad landing zone\" for a new deal with the EU:\n\nNorthern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021\n\nBut Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves\n\nThis arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years\n\nCustoms checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be \"decentralised\", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a \"very small number\" of physical checks\n\nThese checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at \"other points in the supply chain\"\n\nWhat about the EU?\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nAfter receiving the proposals, the EU pledged to examine them carefully.\n\nBut a number of senior figures, including Ireland's Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar, warned the proposals did not form the basis for deeper negotiations - even if they believed a deal could still be done.\n\nFrench President Emanuel Macron said the EU would decide at the end of the week whether a new deal was possible.\n\nBut a leaked presentation to EU diplomats revealed they were unwilling to accept the UK's plans committing to no checks on either side of the Irish border if the Northern Ireland Assembly - Stormont - is granted a veto and there is no guarantee of checks on the UK side.\n\nBBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said EU negotiators were \"so nonplussed by the proposal they asked if it was a mistake\".\n\nIt is understood the UK also wants continuing access to several EU trade databases, even if Stormont withholds its consent for the new arrangements.\n\nWarning from IFS and court challenge\n\nImage copyright PA Media\n\nWhile the negotiations between the UK and EU continue, a warning has been issued by the Institute for Fiscal Studies that even a \"relatively benign\" no-deal Brexit could push UK debt to its highest since the 1960s.\n\nIn the report, the think tank said government borrowing was likely to rise to \u00a3100bn and total debt would soar to 90% of national income.\n\nThe IFS's director, Paul Johnson, said the government was \"now adrift without any effective fiscal anchor\".\n\nBut after the warning - directed at the chancellor as he prepares his annual budget - the Treasury said any decisions would be made \"with a view to the long-term sustainability of the public finances\".\n\nAnother court case has also been launched to prevent a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe Independent Workers Union of Great Britain is supporting three of its members to force the government to seek an extension to the deadline over fears their workers' rights would be watered down.\n\nThe government has promised EU-law derived employment rights will remain in law after Brexit - such as minimum paid holiday and working hours regulations - but the union says ministers would have free rein to change them after the UK leaves the EU.\n\nThe case follows a challenge in the High Court by civil rights group Liberty, which is seeking assurances that the government will abide by the Benn Act to seek an extension if no deal is agreed before 19 October.\n\nIn Scotland, a separate challenge has been brought to the Inner House of the Court of Session - Scotland's highest court - by businessman Dale Vince, Jolyon Maugham QC and SNP MP Joanna Cherry, to ask judges to consider whether a court can sign a Brexit extension request letter on behalf of the government.\n\nThe court will also hear an appeal against a ruling, given on Monday, that Mr Johnson can be trusted to apply the law.\n\nTimeline: What's happening ahead of Brexit deadline?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nTuesday 8 October - Last working day in the House of Commons before it is due to be prorogued - suspended - ahead of a Queen's Speech to begin a new parliamentary session.\n\nMonday 14 October - The Commons is due to return, and the government will use the Queen's Speech to set out its legislative agenda. The speech will then be debated by MPs throughout the week.\n\nThursday 17 October - Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline.\n\nSaturday 19 October - Date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by Parliament and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal.\n\nThursday 31 October - Date by which the UK is due to leave the EU, with or without a withdrawal agreement.\n\nAre you a EU citizen in the UK or a UK citizen living in Europe whose life is affected by a possible no-deal Brexit?
