From left to right: Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Elaine Benes, Jerry Seinfeld as himself, Michael Richards as Cosmo Kramer, and Jason Alexander as George Costanza. Photo: Carin Baer/NBC/Getty Images\n\nThis story was originally published in 2015.\n\nAt long last, you can clear all those syndicated Seinfeld episodes off your DVR. Following years of speculation about when and where the historic sitcom would arrive online, it is finally available to stream on Hulu. (And don\u2019t worry, Netflix partisans: It\u2019s been announced that the show will be moving to that streaming service in 2021.) But with 169 episodes in the Seinfeld archive, it\u2019s understandable if you\u2019re intimidated by the the idea of entering the vault without a guide.\n\nIn the interest of both helping novices prioritize and reminding veterans about forgotten jewels, we\u2019ve ranked every episode in the series from worst to best. The ratings are based less on cultural significance \u2014 you\u2019ll find many recognizable episodes fairly low on the list \u2014 and more on the density and quality of jokes, the inclusion of multiple strong narrative arcs, and, to a lesser extent, how well the comedy and stories have aged.\n\nWe arrived at a count of 169 by considering all two-part and hour-long episodes as single entries. We also omitted the retrospective. With every episode now available on demand, why waste time watching highlights?\n\nThat said, even the worst (well, maybe the fourth-worst) episode of Seinfeld is better than most of what you\u2019ll currently find on network TV \u2014 and now it\u2019s just a Hulu account away. The bingeing is going to be real, and it\u2019s going to be spectacular.\n\n169. \u201cThe Puerto Rican Day Parade\u201d (Season 9). An episode so racially offensive that NBC had to apologize upon its airing, the second-greatest crime that \u201cThe Puerto Rican Day Parade\u201d commits is simply not being funny enough. It\u2019s the loosest version of a bottle episode to come out of the writers\u2019 room \u2014 and of all the bottle episodes in Seinfeld\u2019s run, it\u2019s the dullest, full stop.\n\n168. \u201cThe Outing\u201d (Season 4). After four seasons spent using George\u2019s homophobia as a character flaw, the show wholeheartedly embraces gay panic as a plot device to a nonsensical, largely unfunny degree. The phrase \u201cNot that there\u2019s anything wrong with that\u201d ascends to pop-culture permanency after a practical joke played by Elaine causes a college newspaper reporter to mistake George and Jerry as lovers.\n\n167. \u201cThe Finale\u201d (Season 9). Is the final episode of Seinfeld really that bad? They get what they deserve! It\u2019s a long time coming! Symbolically, it\u2019s perfect! But upon rewatching, you realize that, yeah, it is that bad. Not even the minor revelation that George cheated during \u201cThe Contest\u201d can save what is an uninspired parade of guest stars and forgotten characters. The final scene\u2019s callback to Seinfeld\u2019s first episode is a cute touch, but it\u2019s not enough to save \u201cThe Finale\u201d\u2019s reputation as one of Seinfeld\u2019s lowest points.\n\n166. \u201cThe Jacket\u201d (Season 2). An episode about sitting around waiting for someone in a hotel lobby, \u201cThe Jacket\u201d offers all the thrills of \u2026 sitting around waiting for someone in a hotel lobby. Notable only for the following bit of trivia: Lawrence Tierney, who plays Elaine\u2019s cranky father, Alton Benes, attempted to steal a butcher knife from the set and mock-threatened Seinfeld with the very real prop when caught in the act.\n\n165. \u201cThe Tape\u201d (Season 3). Elaine\u2019s sexy-voice answering-machine prank in this episode is mildly humorous, but the collective horndog mentality displayed by Jerry, George, and Kramer runs contrary to the show\u2019s established platonic-frenemy dynamic. This episode also features the first appearance of Ping, the recurring Chinese-food-delivery-guy character who suffers a bike accident after an encounter with Elaine in \u201cThe Virgin.\u201d\n\n164. \u201cThe Deal\u201d (Season 2). Larry David specifically wrote this episode to satisfy NBC brass\u2019s continued demands to get Jerry and Elaine back together, and it\u2019s easy to see why the writers\u2019 room was eager to split them up shortly thereafter. \u201cThe Deal\u201d packs at least one comedic punch \u2014 Jerry\u2019s birthday gift of $182 cash to Elaine \u2014 but this brief rom-com digression (which includes a seemingly out-of-character coffee-shop convo between Jerry and George about Elaine\u2019s sexual prowess) disrupts the considerable creative gains made at this point in the series.\n\n163. \u201cThe Chinese Woman\u201d (Season 6). Jerry dates a woman who has the surname \u201cChang\u201d but isn\u2019t actually Chinese, which turns into a (possibly accidental) examination of racial stereotypes. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a little racist?\u201d Elaine says when Jerry says he \u201cloves Chinese women.\u201d Jerry disagrees, but jokes about Confucius and conflating Ls for Rs now come off as especially dated. The introduction of the story arc where George\u2019s parents consider getting a divorce \u2014 complete with a cameo from a cape-wearing Larry David, as Frank Costanza\u2019s lawyer \u2014 provides more laughs than the titular woman.\n\n162. \u201cThe Mango\u201d (Season 5). Talk of cunnilingus and faking orgasms on a single episode of network TV that aired in 1993 is groundbreaking stuff \u2014 but Jerry\u2019s incessant needling of Elaine after she admits she \u201cfaked it\u201d during their relationship grows tiresome. Meanwhile, Kramer\u2019s fruit-obsessed subplot feels like a stale reprise of previous episode \u201cThe Ex-Girlfriend,\u201d with the aphrodisiac qualities of mangoes standing in for the Mackinaw peaches.\n\n161. \u201cThe Muffin Tops\u201d (Season 8). All you need to know about this late-period episode is that most of the characters end up in the dump, and they deserve to be there. Elaine and Mr. Lippman selling muffin tops and donating the bottoms to food banks, Jerry shaving his chest, Kramer\u2019s ultra-meta \u201cJ. Peterman Reality Tour\u201d: a bunch of half-formed ideas crammed into an episode where the only notable element is George finally \u2014 finally \u2014 getting fired from the Yankees.\n\n160. \u201cThe Ex-Girlfriend\u201d (Season 2). An episode that builds to one specific punch line: A woman Jerry\u2019s seeing doesn\u2019t want to sleep with him because she doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s a funny comedian \u2014 and not much else. It\u2019s also notable as the first episode where George explicitly acknowledges his homophobia: \u201cYou\u2019re a little homophobic, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Elaine asks, to which he replies, \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d\n\n159. \u201cThe Gum\u201d (Season 7). The dynamic between George and perpetual nemesis Lloyd Braun is always a treat, but other episodes explore it better than \u201cThe Gum,\u201d which largely and improbably focuses on Elaine accidentally exposing herself multiple times due to a faulty button.\n\n158. \u201cMale Unbonding\u201d (Season 1). The only episode in the series without the in the title and, arguably of more importance, the introduction of Elaine \u2014 even though the episode doesn\u2019t give her much to do. Kramer\u2019s first get-rich-quick scheme \u2014 a make-your-own-pizza restaurant \u2014 is the highlight of this otherwise-inconsequential early episode.\n\n157. \u201cThe Strong Box\u201d (Season 9). Seinfeld mined some dark material over its run, but the central plot of \u201cThe Strong Box\u201d \u2014 Kramer and Jerry dig up a neighbor\u2019s dead parrot to retrieve a key that had been fed to the bird \u2014 is impossibly, joylessly grim. Proof that, even in Seinfeld\u2019s universe, there\u2019s such a thing as too dark.\n\n156. \u201cThe Dog\u201d (Season 3). Following several episodes where George and Elaine successfully scheme together, it made no sense to build a story around their inability to hang out when Jerry isn\u2019t present. That flawed premise led to 22 minutes with little more than frictionless dialogue. There was some decent physical comedy between Jerry and the offscreen canine Farfel, though.\n\n155. \u201cThe Stock Tip\u201d (Season 1). Jerry\u2019s weekend away with new flame Vanessa ends up being a sedate affair for him, Vanessa, and the viewers at home. Meanwhile, George\u2019s success in the stock market serves as a reminder that it\u2019s more enjoyable to see him lose than win.\n\n154. \u201cThe Seinfeld Chronicles\u201d (Pilot). It was tempting to call Seinfeld\u2019s first episode its worst: The pacing is molasses-slow, the dialogue is stiff, and the singular focus on Jerry\u2019s romantic life doesn\u2019t prove very interesting. But the first-ever scene between Jerry and Kramer in the former\u2019s apartment is compelling enough to see why NBC brass decided to take a chance on the show.\n\n153. \u201cThe Robbery\u201d (Season 1). Kramer\u2019s negligence \u2014 which leads to Jerry\u2019s apartment getting robbed \u2014 has implications for later seasons, but the gang\u2019s real-estate squabbling drags down the episode\u2019s momentum and doesn\u2019t make for much of a plot.\n\nPhoto: NBC\n\n152. \u201cThe Parking Space\u201d (Season 3). A fairly inconsequential episode about parallel parking and a weird noise in Jerry\u2019s car, \u201cThe Parking Space\u201d is memorable for its staging: two cars, owned by George and Jerry\u2019s friend Mike, respectively, in a diagonal standoff over a spot. If only the rest of the episode delivered on this visual punch.\n\n151. \u201cThe Nose Job\u201d (Season 3). George\u2019s horrified reaction to his girlfriend Audrey\u2019s plastic surgery \u2014 which he talked her into \u2014 speaks to his despicable core, but there\u2019s something ultimately dissatisfying about seeing Kramer end up with her.\n\n150. \u201cThe Suicide\u201d (Season 3). How much is a Drake\u2019s Coffee Cake, anyway? The many battles involving the pastry \u2014 who has it, who wants it, and, in a fasting Elaine\u2019s case, whom she has to attack to get a bite of it herself \u2014 overshadow the episode\u2019s lackluster main plot, which involves Jerry, a neighbor\u2019s suicide attempt, and the neighbor\u2019s amorous girlfriend.\n\n149. \u201cThe Postponement\u201d (Season 7). This is mostly a comedown episode following George\u2019s rushed engagement to Susan. Elaine\u2019s entanglement with a blabby rabbi provides some laughs but is beset by a plot that\u2019s a little too convoluted even for Seinfeld\u2019s notoriously all-over-the-place later seasons.\n\n148. \u201cThe Checks\u201d (Season 8). Elaine singing \u201cWitchy Woman\u201d to her unamused boyfriend Brett is an inspired moment. Less so is Kramer\u2019s treatment of the Japanese tourists staying with him, even if the plot is more a commentary on Kramer\u2019s ignorance than it is on Japanese culture.\n\n147. \u201cThe Shoes\u201d (Season 4). What begins with George bungling a pilot deal with NBC after staring at the cleavage of the network honcho\u2019s daughter ends with Elaine using her cleavage to manipulate that same boss into resurrecting the deal. So, yeah, an episode of Girls this is not \u2014 but Bob Balaban sneering in George\u2019s ear, \u201cGet a good look, Costanza?\u201d is a delicious moment.\n\n146. \u201cThe Susie\u201d (Season 8). Who is Susie? \u201cI\u2019m Susie, she\u2019s me,\u201d Elaine tells J. Peterman at the end of this episode \u2014 but Peterman doesn\u2019t get it, and neither does the audience. The plot of \u201cThe Susie,\u201d a mistaken-identity tale taken four or five steps too far, seems impressive at first, but in the end there are no failures or successes \u2014 just confusion.\n\n145. \u201cThe Keys\u201d (Season 3). One of a few episodes in Seinfeld\u2019s early seasons that temporarily upsets the show\u2019s dynamic, the season-three finale sees Kramer flee to L.A. after Jerry demands his spare keys back. The story works best as an extended setup for the supersize L.A.-centric episode \u201cThe Trip,\u201d though Kramer\u2019s Murphy Brown cameo at the end provides perfect punctuation.\n\nPhoto: NBC\n\n144. \u201cThe Apartment\u201d (Season 2). \u201cGET OUT!\u201d Elaine\u2019s first shove is captured in this early episode, but \u201cThe Apartment\u201d is most notable for George engaging in hilariously despicable behavior for the first time, when he pretends to be married to pick up women at a party. The rest of the episode focuses on Jerry not wanting Elaine to move into his building.\n\n143. \u201cThe Soup Nazi\u201d (Season 7). One of many episodes where the cultural resonance (\u201cNo soup for you!\u201d) overshadows the episode\u2019s just-okay comedic material \u2014 George\u2019s annoyance at Jerry and his girlfriend Sheila calling each other \u201cschmoopie\u201d is funny, but Elaine and Kramer\u2019s subplot just sits there like the armoire they try (and fail) to move into the former\u2019s apartment.\n\n142. \u201cThe Smelly Car\u201d (Season 4). On one hand: George fretting that he \u201cturned\u201d Susan gay is hilarious in that it further mines his own neurotic bigotry. On the other hand: Suggesting that Kramer can \u201cturn\u201d Susan\u2019s girlfriend straight toes the line of ignorance, especially in hindsight. But Jerry\u2019s car really stinks, and seeing everyone make a gas face when they enter it is funny.\n\n141. \u201cThe Visa\u201d (Season 4). Ping returns, as does Babu Bhatt (who lost his restaurant after Jerry\u2019s meddling in \u201cThe Caf\u00e9\u201d). The former is suing Elaine for the accident detailed in \u201cThe Virgin,\u201d and the latter gets deported after a mail mix-up between Jerry, Elaine, and George. What saves \u201cThe Visa\u201d from a place in the bottom ten of this list is George forcing Jerry not to be funny so he can impress a girlfriend, only for the girlfriend to fall for fake-sad Jerry.\n\n140. \u201cThe Package\u201d (Season 8). There\u2019s some painfully funny pathos found in Elaine\u2019s (and, eventually, Uncle Leo\u2019s) attempts to get proper medical coverage while being labeled as a \u201cdifficult\u201d patient. George\u2019s pre-sexting-era attempt to exchange racy photos with a one-hour-photo employee, however, falls comparatively flat.\n\n139. \u201cThe Watch\u201d (Season 4). George botching his and Jerry\u2019s NBC deal is nails-on-a-chalkboard uncomfortable \u2014 and quite funny as a result \u2014 but this episode exists as little more than a way to push forward the Jerry and George pilot arc that runs through the fourth season (and to further establish Uncle Leo\u2019s, uh, unique character traits).\n\n138. \u201cThe Wig Master\u201d (Season 7). The Kramer-as-pimp payoff isn\u2019t worth what precedes it, but it\u2019s funny to see George double-teamed in a domestic situation by both Susan and the wig master staying with them. Is Craig\u2019s ponytail approaching a man-bun? Discuss!\n\n137. \u201cThe Stakeout\u201d (Season 1). What distinguishes this early episode is the creation of George\u2019s architect-cum-importer/exporter alter ego, Art Vandelay (initially \u201cArt Vandercore\u201d and \u201cArt Corvolet\u201d). Jerry\u2019s attempt to date an acquaintance of Elaine\u2019s behind her back, meanwhile, makes for a forgettable thread.\n\n136. \u201cThe Big Salad\u201d (Season 6). Say any set of words enough times and it sounds funny, which is why most of this episode\u2019s comedic gas comes from hearing both Elaine and George\u2019s girlfriend Julie repeat the phrase big salad. There\u2019s some legitimate pathos in Jerry struggling with his girlfriend Margaret having previously dated \u2014 and been dumped by \u2014 Newman, but Kramer\u2019s O.J.-referencing plotline doesn\u2019t leave a mark.\n\n135. \u201cThe Shower Head\u201d (Season 7). If nothing else, this episode serves as a public service announcement: Don\u2019t eat a lot of poppy-seed muffins if you need to pass a drug test. (Really.) Otherwise, it\u2019s more or less a comedown narrative after Jerry\u2019s parents are dramatically evicted from Del Boca Vista.\n\n134. \u201cThe Truth\u201d (Season 3). George using \u201cthe truth\u201d to break up with a girlfriend makes for a good premise, but in terms of a solid, engaging plot, this episode falls flat. Elaine telling George that he\u2019s cheap is priceless, though, as is the exaggerated physical comedy as Kramer attempts to undress himself in front of Elaine and Jerry after he accidentally sees the former naked.\n\n133. \u201cThe Wait Out\u201d (Season 7). If you like gags about tight pants, this one\u2019s for you: The slacks Kramer dons are so tight that Michael Richards actually injured himself in the scene where Jerry tries to take them off for him. Elsewhere, Jerry and Elaine scheming to break up a married couple falls somewhere between diabolical and boring, and George is just around.\n\n132. \u201cThe Ticket\u201d (Season 4). Newman and Kramer\u2019s exploits while trying to get Newman out of a parking ticket \u2014 heightened as they were by the head trauma Kramer sustained during a violent encounter with \u201cCrazy\u201d Joe Davola \u2014 carry this otherwise exposition-heavy episode.\n\nPhoto: Barry Slobin/NBC/Getty Images\n\n131. \u201cThe Wink\u201d (Season 7). As George\u2019s descent out of the Yankees\u2019 good graces continues, Kramer reaches a new low by promising a sick child that Paul O\u2019Neill will hit two home runs in one game. Kramer does a lot of despicable things throughout Seinfeld, but trying to rip a signed greeting card from a sick kid\u2019s hands is one for the ages.\n\n130. \u201cThe Statue\u201d (Season 2). George\u2019s anecdote about a disastrous \u201cMacArthur Park\u201d lip-syncing session leading to a broken family heirloom provides valuable insight into his hilariously tortured family life. This episode also marks the introduction of Jerry as an obsessive neat freak.\n\n129. \u201cThe Junior Mint\u201d (Season 4). Jerry failing to remember his girlfriend\u2019s name is legendary (\u201cMULVA?!?\u201d), but when it comes to this otherwise minor episode, you might be better off playing the video game.\n\n128. \u201cThe Bottle Deposit\u201d (Season 7). This two-parter is a spiritual predecessor to \u201cThe Muffin Tops\u201d in that its zany concept \u2014 driving across state lines to cash in recycled bottles for more money \u2014 goes so off the rails that by the end of the episode, you barely know what you\u2019re watching. Saving this from a lower ranking is George attempting to please his boss, Mr. Wilhem, by accomplishing a task without ever actually understanding what the task is. (He pulls it off, too.)\n\n127. \u201cThe Strike\u201d (Season 9). Ah, the Festivus episode, an amazing concept in an episode that, quite frankly, needed more Festivus. Kramer and Elaine\u2019s arcs are full of dull scheming, and Jerry\u2019s romantic travails come across as a tad too petty. George\u2019s establishment of the fake \u201cHuman Fund\u201d charity, however, is a perfect manifestation of both his avarice and selfishness.\n\n126. \u201cThe Opera\u201d (Season 4). The \u201cCrazy\u201d Joe Davola plotline that runs through the fourth season is mostly and mercifully resolved, but the real gold here is watching George try to scalp opera tickets in an alleyway and Kramer facing his fear of clowns.\n\n125. \u201cThe Soup\u201d (Season 6). Our introduction to Jerry\u2019s stand-up nemesis Bania makes this otherwise minor episode proof that even in its later seasons, Seinfeld\u2019s writers continued to create what would become classic characters in the series. (Also: manure, George? Really?)\n\n124. \u201cThe Alternate Side\u201d (Season 3). We get a taste of how cruel Elaine can be as a romantic partner when she breaks up with an older boyfriend after he has a stroke. George trying his hand as an amateur parking attendant offers some laughs, but let\u2019s face it \u2014 you\u2019re here to hear Kramer utter, \u201cThese pretzels are making me thirsty.\u201d\n\n123. \u201cThe Secretary\u201d (Season 6). Between Kramer\u2019s blessing-and-a-curse status as a kavorka and George\u2019s apparent weakness for having sex in his office, \u201cThe Secretary\u201d functions best as a reminder of the show\u2019s labyrinthine mythology. That said, we do get introduced to George\u2019s faceless Yankees boss, George Steinbrenner, voiced brilliantly by Larry David.\n\nPhoto: NBC\n\n122. \u201cThe Letter\u201d (Season 3). The grand unveiling of The Kramer, the painting that has lived on as a dorm-room-poster staple. The drama between Jerry and his girlfriend Nina (played by Catherine Keener) is meh, but it\u2019s always fun to watch Elaine get in trouble at work.\n\n121. \u201cThe Pie\u201d (Season 5). The introduction of the hygiene-challenged cook Poppie, who does more damage later in the series. We\u2019ll never know why Jerry\u2019s girlfriend Audrey refuses to take a bite of pie, and we don\u2019t want to know why George is attracted to a mannequin that looks like Elaine.\n\n120. \u201cThe Comeback\u201d (Season 8). The title says it all: George\u2019s attempts to stick up for himself in the workplace fail, hilariously showcasing his pettiness and inability to let anything go. Too bad the side plots \u2014 Kramer\u2019s living will, Jerry and the bad tennis instructor \u2014 aren\u2019t as inspired.\n\n119. \u201cThe Jimmy\u201d (Season 6). Is Jimmy, the gym rat who can\u2019t stop saying his own name, mentally disabled? Will Kramer\u2019s novocaine from dental surgery ever wear off? Is Tim Whatley running a sex club in his dentist\u2019s office? The last plotline is perhaps season six\u2019s most terrifying because it could conceivably happen. You don\u2019t know what dentists do after they put you under.\n\n118. \u201cThe Switch\u201d (Season 6). Cosmo! We finally learn Kramer\u2019s first name and meet his mother. Meanwhile, George\u2019s insensitivity toward his girlfriend\u2019s possible bulimia is funny in its off-color tone, though it\u2019s hard to imagine the gag sitting well with today\u2019s audiences.\n\n117. \u201cThe Phone Message\u201d (Season 2). This episode marks the first time Jerry rejects a romantic interest for a questionable reason. (In this case, she likes Dockers commercials.) George scheming to switch a tape in the answering machine of a girl he\u2019s dating is funny enough, but not as much as the revelation that his father wears shoes in the pool.\n\n116. \u201cThe Good Samaritan\u201d (Season 3). George sheds light on his ceaseless self-deprecation with two sentences: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m special. My mother always said I\u2019m not special.\u201d You know what is special? Kramer\u2019s massive seizure while hearing Mary Hart\u2019s voice on Entertainment Tonight, a bit of physical comedy that turns him into a contorting rubber band of a human being.\n\n115. \u201cThe Race\u201d (Season 6). Elaine\u2019s battle with a Chinese-food deliveryman who\u2019s blacklisted her from ordering from his restaurant is more of the unfortunate racial humor that occasionally crops up in Seinfeld. What redeems the episode is Elaine\u2019s quest to get her Communist boyfriend to dress snappier. (\u201cCan\u2019t you at least look like a successful Communist?\u201d) Jerry\u2019s attempt to play Superman to a black-haired girlfriend named Lois (get it?) is medium-funny at best.\n\n114. \u201cThe Boyfriend\u201d (Season 3). The show\u2019s first hour-long arc drags quite a bit. Keith Hernandez\u2019s guest spot feels forced and painful, but the episode has its good moments: specifically, George going to ridiculous lengths to extend his unemployment benefits, and a conspiracy-heavy JFK spoof that digs deeper into Kramer and Newman\u2019s incessant scheming.\n\n113. \u201cThe Stand-In\u201d (Season 5). Jerry literally kills someone by making him laugh too hard \u2014 dark stuff. Clearly, he\u2019s come a long way from women rejecting him for not being funny enough. George being corrected after using the term midget is a rare moment of political correctness for the show.\n\n112. \u201cThe Pothole\u201d (Season 8). Yet another episode where Elaine has trouble with Chinese-food-delivery guys? It\u2019s a strange well to revisit twice, but the bit works better here, when she attempts to order \u201cSupreme Flounder\u201d to a janitor\u2019s closet in a building across the street only to be mistaken for the janitor. Meanwhile, Kramer repainting highway lanes makes for a spectacular disaster.\n\n111. \u201cThe Parking Garage\u201d (Season 3). This feels like a urine-laden attempt to replicate the structural successes of the groundbreaking \u201cChinese Restaurant\u201d episode, but it doesn\u2019t deliver as fully. Bonus points for a surprising Scientology joke that somehow feels both relevant and slightly dated \u2014 and RIP, Elaine\u2019s fish, you never stood a chance.\n\n110. \u201cThe Doll\u201d (Season 7). There\u2019s great physical comedy in Frank Costanza and Kramer trying to play billiards in George\u2019s old bedroom, but the achievement of this episode is setting up Kathy Griffin\u2019s recurring guest-role as Sally Weaver, Susan\u2019s former roommate, who returns with aplomb in \u201cThe Cartoon.\u201d\n\n109. \u201cThe Scofflaw\u201d (Season 6). Who is the \u201cwhite whale\u201d of a traffic scofflaw that the one-eyed police officer is pursuing in this episode? (The answer may surprise you \u2014 or it won\u2019t.) Jason Alexander fidgets brilliantly while depicting George\u2019s inability to keep a secret \u2014 and yet for once, George isn\u2019t the biggest liar in an episode.\n\n108. \u201cThe Diplomat\u2019s Club\u201d (Season 6). Seinfeld\u2019s history with racial humor is turned on its head as George tries desperately to find a black friend after offending his boss by telling him he looks like Sugar Ray Leonard. There\u2019s a secondary arc that features Kramer and a wealthy Texas businessman betting on plane arrival times at the airport, but your level of interest in that story likely depends on how much you know or care about gambling.\n\n107. \u201cThe Virgin\u201d (Season 4). Really just a setup for the all-time classic \u201cThe Contest,\u201d this episode\u2014featuring a story credit from the Farrelly Brothers\u2014is one of many in which George both intentionally and unintentionally enacts incredible cruelty towards Susan.\n\n106. \u201cThe Pitch\u201d (Season 4). A significant episode simply because it introduces Seinfeld\u2019s greatest tragic figure: Susan, whose debut involves being the target of Kramer\u2019s explosive disagreement with some spoiled milk.\n\n105. \u201cThe Friar\u2019s Club\u201d (Season 7). One of a few times where Kramer\u2019s half-baked schemes comes close to costing him his life \u2014 like, really close. As a secondary thread, Elaine\u2019s attempts to find out whether a co-worker is faking a disability produce a good deal of laughs.\n\n104. \u201cThe Stranded\u201d (Season 3). George\u2019s cheapness rears its ugly head in a meaningful way for the first time, and it even lands him in jail. (Jerry gets arrested, too, for paying a prostitute \u2014 but officer, it\u2019s not what it seems.) Above all, \u201cThe Stranded\u201d is notable for Elaine bringing an obscure film quote from the 1980s into the cultural lexicon.\n\n103. \u201cThe Revenge\u201d (Season 2). The job talk between George and Jerry, one of the show\u2019s classic conversations, is at the center of this episode. Not far behind is George \u201cslipping a mickey\u201d into his boss\u2019s drink to get \u201crevenge,\u201d a diabolical plan that reinforces here in the early seasons just how broken of a moral compass he possesses. (Elaine helps him out, so there\u2019s a lesson about her, too.)\n\n102. \u201cThe Heart Attack\u201d (Season 2). Home to one of Larry David\u2019s only on-camera appearances, as well as a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it cameo from career character actor Stephen Tobolowsky. Not the strongest overall episode, but the scene where two paramedics argue about who ate the last of the Chuckles is a subtle suggestion that, in the Seinfeld universe, it isn\u2019t just the main characters who act like assholes.\n\nPhoto: NBC\n\n101. \u201cThe Reverse Peephole\u201d (Season 9). The only thing funnier than Jerry comparing George\u2019s overstuffed wallet to a fat hamburger is George losing the entirety of its contents to a gust of wind. The rest of the episode\u2019s arcs \u2014 including Kramer and Newman installing reverse peepholes, seemingly just to give these characters something to do \u2014 aren\u2019t as memorable.\n\n100. \u201cThe Andrea Doria\u201d (Season 8). Jerry forming a rare alliance with Newman is notable, but not as much as the magical realism of Kramer taking dog medication and showing some, uh, doglike symptoms. Pour one out for Jerry, who vainly tries to get rid of Newman once and for all.\n\n99. \u201cThe Hot Tub\u201d (Season 7). One of the more bizarre and convoluted episodes of late-period Seinfeld, \u201cThe Hot Tub\u201d sees Jerry, Elaine, and Kramer destroy marathon runner Jean-Paul\u2019s chances of winning the New York City Marathon, albeit entirely by accident. At this point in the series, the plot-dovetailing becomes so complicated that it\u2019s hard to tell whether the intersections are brilliant or totally accidental.\n\n98. \u201cThe Cheever Letters\u201d (Season 4). The aftermath of Susan\u2019s father\u2019s cabin burning down is, unfortunately, not as funny as when the actual cabin burns down. The surprise twist involving John Cheever is a nice absurdist touch, though, and any episode with Grace Zabriskie, who is a riot as Susan\u2019s mother, is worth watching.\n\n97. \u201cThe Calzone\u201d (Season 7). A showcase of Richards\u2019s incomparable gift for physical comedy \u2014 first when he tries to toast his clothes in the oven where George gets Steinbrenner calzones for lunch every day, and then when he throws a sack of pennies at Elaine\u2019s non-boyfriend Todd Gack. The show\u2019s mythological relationship with Cuban cigars returns here, too, with Peruvian cigars masquerading as Cubans but not quite cutting the mustard.\n\n96. \u201cThe Junk Mail\u201d (Season 9). \u201cSEINFELD\u2019S VAN! SEINFELD\u2019S VAN!\u201d Everyone knows that illicit behavior often happens in the back of vans, and man, what occurs in Seinfeld\u2019s van at the end of this episode is so depraved it shocks even George, the most depraved individual of all.\n\n95. \u201cThe Wife\u201d (Season 5). Come for the cameo by a pre-Friends Courteney Cox as a girlfriend of Jerry\u2019s pretending to be his wife for free dry cleaning; stay for George and Elaine arguing about the former getting caught pissing in the gym shower: \u201cSince when is a drain a toilet?\u201d\n\n94. \u201cThe Sponge\u201d (Season 7). When it comes to vanity on Seinfeld, does any infraction come close to Jerry adjusting the size number on his jeans from a 32 to a 31? The episode also features the classic Elaine contraceptive plotline that gives the episode its name and coins the pop-cultural catchphrase spongeworthy.\n\n93. \u201cThe English Patient\u201d (Season 8). The Kramer subplot involving unemployed Dominicans and Cuban cigars is unfortunate, but Elaine\u2019s refusal to enjoy the stuffy, overblown melodrama of The English Patient is the type of highbrow/lowbrow battleground that Seinfeld was made to tackle. (Sack Lunch looks like a better movie, anyway.)\n\n92. \u201cThe Yada Yada\u201d (Season 8). Seinfeld didn\u2019t invent yada yada, but it did propel it to stratospheric pop-cultural prominence \u2014 unlike spongeworthy, people still say it today. As for whether or not Tim Whatley converted to Judaism for the jokes, does it matter? He tries to use mistletoe on Elaine during Hanukkah in \u201cThe Strike,\u201d so either way, his commitment to the religion is dubious.\n\n91. \u201cThe Busboy\u201d (Season 2). The first time in the series when several plot points perfectly intersect \u2014 plus a frantic powerhouse performance by Louis-Dreyfus (her first in the series, arguably) when Elaine tries to get a disheveled, unwanted houseguest out of her apartment and to the airport.\n\n90. \u201cThe Pony Remark\u201d (Season 2). Right before Jerry\u2019s relative Manya passes away, she utters what might be the series\u2019 first eminently quotable line: \u201cI had a pony!\u201d Elaine being forced to sit in a small chair during Manya\u2019s commemorative dinner is a great visual gag, too.\n\n89. \u201cThe Pick\u201d (Season 4). Between Jerry\u2019s not-really-a-nose-pick and Elaine\u2019s very-much-a-nip-slip, this is an episode all about public embarrassment \u2014 a key component of Seinfeld\u2019s thematic essence. Plus: Susan and George are back together! For now, anyway.\n\n88. \u201cThe Wallet\u201d (Season 4). Jerry\u2019s father screaming, \u201cMy wallet\u2019s gone!\u201d in an impossibly shrill, panicked voice is like \u201cMaster of the House\u201d in the otherwise-terrible episode \u201cThe Jacket\u201d: Hear it once and it\u2019s stuck in your head forever. This episode also deserves a place in the Tumblr Hall of Fame simply for spawning one of the internet\u2019s most oft-used GIFs:\n\n87. \u201cThe Implant\u201d (Season 4). Despite this episode\u2019s potent quotable (\u201cThey\u2019re real, and they\u2019re spectacular\u201d), the plot concerning whether \u201cthey\u2019re\u201d real or not isn\u2019t actually all that funny. You know what is funny? George trying to get discounted airfare while traveling to a girlfriend\u2019s family member\u2019s funeral \u2014 and getting into a fight with one of her relatives over double-dipping a chip.\n\n86. \u201cThe Puffy Shirt\u201d (Season 5). Larry David has described this episode, centered around a \u201clow talker\u201d who accidentally convinces Jerry to model the titular shirt on the Today show, as one of his favorites of the series. As the endless complications of Curb Your Enthusiasm\u2019s plotlines prove, \u201cThe Puffy Shirt\u201d indeed seems ripped right from David\u2019s brain.\n\n85. \u201cThe Chinese Restaurant\u201d (Season 2). Seems low on the list, huh? It\u2019s true that this episode is as groundbreaking as Seinfeld gets \u2014 it drives home the \u201cshow about nothing\u201d conceit and makes it work structurally, laying the groundwork for many future TV shows (as well as many future episodes of Seinfeld). But if we can be real here: The plot of \u201cThe Chinese Restaurant\u201d takes way too long to get going, a common problem with many early-era Seinfeld episodes. Once it does, though, it\u2019s best moments \u2014 Elaine attempting to eat off a patron\u2019s plate as part of a bet, the restaurant\u2019s host yelling \u201cCartwright!\u201d when George\u2019s girlfriend calls looking for him \u2014 make it an above-average episode with a narrative device that delivers the rest of the way.\n\n84. \u201cThe Note\u201d (Season 3). Possibly the most flagrant display of homophobia from George, who Can\u2019t. Even. after he receives a massage from a man. The mixture of shame and terror in his eyes when he tells Jerry \u201cit moved\u201d is pathetic and hilarious \u2014 as is the vocal-heavy scatting that happens in this episode\u2019s interstitial music (a flourish thankfully discarded soon thereafter).\n\n83. \u201cThe Pilot\u201d (Season 4). Like many two-parters, this one starts to sag when it reaches its second half. Still, there are gems to be mined in the first half \u2014 especially Jeremy Piven\u2019s audition to play \u201cGeorge\u201d in George and Jerry\u2019s pilot; Larry Hankin\u2019s performance as an actor playing \u201cKramer,\u201d who steals a box of raisins from the audition room; and the parade of actors who take a shot at replicating Kramer\u2019s famous entrances.\n\n82. \u201cThe Fatigues\u201d (Season 8). Elaine continues to amusingly run Peterman\u2019s company into the ground in the absence of its namesake, and her interactions with the shell-shocked employee Sherman are great. Then Frank Costanza\u2019s PTSD as a cook in the Korean War closes the episode out with fantastic, disastrous bravado.\n\n81. \u201cThe Understudy\u201d (Season 6). What is it with Seinfeld using Asian culture as a setup for punch lines? They do it a lot! What saves this episode from a lower rank is Bette Midler\u2019s pitch-perfect guest spot, a performance so wonderful that you wish she had dropped everything and joined the cast as a full-time regular.\n\n80. \u201cThe Sniffing Accountant\u201d (Season 5). At the least now we know what an allergy to mohair looks like. Another great physical performance from Richards, whose reaction after sticking the lit end of a cigarette in his mouth is priceless. (What a hipster doofus.)\n\n79. \u201cThe Millennium\u201d (Season 8). George is so bad at everything related to employment that he can\u2019t even get fired properly. (Destroying the Yankees\u2019 World Series trophy should do the trick, even if someone else tries to take the fall.) The dovetail between Kramer and Elaine\u2019s Putumayo scheme and Jerry\u2019s speed-dial woes should discourage anyone addicted to free samples in clothing stores.\n\n78. \u201cThe Dealership\u201d (Season 9). Of all of the show\u2019s \u201cKHAN!!\u201d exclamations from George, the one at the climax of this episode might be the best. The conflict between Jerry, Elaine, and Puddy feels like a less-sex-obsessed version of their subplot in \u201cThe Fusilli Jerry,\u201d but Kramer taking the concept of a \u201ctest drive\u201d to the absolute limit is weirdly exhilarating.\n\n77. \u201cThe Serenity Now\u201d (Season 9). Lloyd Braun finally loses to George \u2014 but let\u2019s face it, George is forever a loser. Elaine is swarmed by marriage proposals and other propositions from men who can\u2019t resist her \u201cshiksa appeal\u201d \u2014 including Jerry and George \u2014 but the plot\u2019s fantastical nature makes it less creepy than similar arcs from previous seasons. George is right, too: \u201cHoochie mama\u201d is more fun to yell than \u201cSerenity now!\u201d\n\n76. \u201cThe Pez Dispenser\u201d (Season 3). Sometimes all you need is one unforgettable moment to make a Seinfeld episode \u2014 and here, Jerry clapping his fingers together for the Tweety bird Pez dispenser is that moment. We also get our first whiff of Kramer\u2019s beach-scented cologne, as well as calamitous dovetail between an intervention for Jerry\u2019s friend and a Polar Bear Club meeting.\n\nPhoto: NBC\n\n75. \u201cThe Frogger\u201d (Season 9). What a stupid episode, right? Sure, but TV is stupid, and even with the heaps of praise that Seinfeld receives, it can be plenty stupid in ways both good and bad. \u201cThe Frogger\u201d is a prime example of good stupid, mostly because watching Jerry run like a chicken in fear of \u201cthe Lopper\u201d is twice as funny as George trying to preserve a high score on a video game he played in high school.\n\n74. \u201cThe Little Jerry\u201d (Season 8). Yeah, yeah, Kramer and Jerry\u2019s adventures in cockfighting with the episode\u2019s namesake rooster are funny in their surreality \u2014 but George attempting to date a woman in jail and keep her imprisoned to avoid commitment is some truly evil-genius stuff.\n\n73. \u201cThe Handicap Spot\u201d (Season 4). George continually outdoes his own terribleness in this episode: He parks in a handicapped space, buys a cheap wheelchair for the handicapped woman he inconvenienced, and then, after she suffers an accident and is gifted a TV by the charity George\u2019s father represents, he and the gang return the TV at the same mall where they got caught taking the handicapped spot. Tightly scripted, thoroughly reprehensible.\n\n72. \u201cThe Red Dot\u201d (Season 3). The episode\u2019s conclusion, in which Jerry makes a joke about falling off the wagon and Elaine\u2019s reformed alcoholic boyfriend toasts him with a cup of coffee, feels false \u2014 Seinfeld, at its best, is explicitly not a \u201cfeel-good\u201d show. That said, George\u2019s sexual indiscretion during his tenure at Pendant Publishing (\u201cWas that wrong?\u201d) is one for the ages.\n\n71. \u201cThe Apology\u201d (Season 9). Elaine\u2019s explanation of the difference between male and female nudity is priceless, but the real whiz-bang comes when she, Puddy, and germophobe co-worker Peggy spit out their dinner after finding out that Kramer has prepared it in his bathtub. Germs! Germs! Germs!\n\n70. \u201cThe Caddy\u201d (Season 7). One simple rule: If the bra doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit. Sue Ellen aside, George fakes his attendance in the Yankees\u2019 office for so long that the team eventually think he\u2019s dead, thereby torpedoing the promotion that he was lined up to get by faking his own attendance. Classic George.\n\n69. \u201cThe Cartoon\u201d (Season 9). Essentially a full-length version of Jerry\u2019s heckling incident from the superior episode \u201cThe Fire,\u201d here the funnyman is made the butt of every joke by Sally Weaver (remember her?), who goes as far to stage a successful one-man show tearing Jerry to shreds. Newman, as you can imagine, is a fan.\n\n68. \u201cThe Blood\u201d (Season 9). Possibly the only episode of Seinfeld that could be referred to as Cronenbergian, the twist at the end is so shocking, so potentially revolting that it\u2019ll have you gasping before you can even yell, \u201cMANDELBAUM!\u201d\n\n67. \u201cThe Limo\u201d (Season 3). A better bottle episode than \u201cThe Chinese Restaurant\u201d and \u201cThe Parking Garage\u201d combined, this one sees Jerry and George make an ethically questionable decision and thereafter suffer every imaginable consequence. Nazi leader George Costanza \u2014 what will his parents think?\n\n66. \u201cThe Pool Guy\u201d (Season 7). An impossibly dated episode (calling Moviefone, ha), though Kramer\u2019s \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell me the name of the movie you\u2019re trying to see?\u201d bit works \u2014 partially because it\u2019s so hilariously implausible, and partially because he has George on the other end of the line.\n\n65. \u201cThe Cadillac\u201d (Season 7). Any episode set in Del Boca Vista is bound to be enjoyable, and this two-parter featuring the elder Seinfelds\u2019 exile from their Florida retirement community has plenty of laughs \u2014 including a moment of comeuppance for Jerry\u2019s atrocious behavior in \u201cThe Rye.\u201d Kramer\u2019s cable-company war is comparatively negligible, while George\u2019s attempted dalliance with Marisa Tomei behind Susan\u2019s back toes the line between hilariously terrible and just terrible.\n\n64. \u201cThe Foundation\u201d (Season 8). What\u2019s worse than George\u2019s lack of guilt following Susan\u2019s death? How about the genuine expressions of remorse that cross his face when he finds out about the access to Susan\u2019s family\u2019s riches he would\u2019ve had if he hadn\u2019t, y\u2019know, accidentally killed her?\n\n63. \u201cThe Betrayal\u201d (Season 9). Ah, the infamous \u201cbackwards episode,\u201d which was hated at the time of release. Granted, it\u2019s a cheap gimmick, and it gets more than a little confusing, and Kramer\u2019s personal war with Franklin Delano Romanowski isn\u2019t too compelling. But you know what? It\u2019s better than you remember, and George\u2019s black-spray-painted Timberlands remain something to behold, in forward or backward motion.\n\n62. \u201cThe Money\u201d (Season 8). Klompus! Jerry\u2019s elderly nemesis engages in a series of transactions with him that eventually leave Jerry seemingly homeless. As the title suggests, the episode\u2019s all about money \u2014 George tries to nab an inheritance by banking on his parents\u2019 imminent deaths and Elaine loses her stock options when Peterman returns \u2014 but only the brief time that Morty Seinfeld spends working for Elaine feels creatively bankrupt as a concept.\n\n61. \u201cThe Marine Biologist\u201d (Season 5). George has told a lot of lies \u2014 a lot of lies \u2014 throughout Seinfeld, but his pretending to be a marine biologist to impress a former classmate-cum-love-interest is one of his greatest and most flimsy. And yet, he almost pulls it off. More physical-comedy genius from Richards, too, as he shakes sand out of his pockets following a disastrous golfing day at the beach.\n\n60. \u201cThe Barber\u201d (Season 5). An epic struggle between two barbers over Jerry\u2019s precious (well, once-precious) head of hair only reinforces the emotional power of Edward Scissorhands. It\u2019s always funny to watch George pretend to work, too, as he pushes around \u201cthe Penske File\u201d at a job without being sure if he\u2019s even actually employed.\n\n59. \u201cThe Beard\u201d (Season 6). Elaine\u2019s attempt to \u201cconvert\u201d a gay man into falling in love with her is another plotline that hasn\u2019t aged well \u2014 but Jerry taking a lie-detector test to prove to his police-officer paramour that he doesn\u2019t watch Melrose Place is inspired. (Also: George in a toupee. GEORGE IN A TOUPEE.)\n\n58. \u201cThe Doorman\u201d (Season 6). Larry Miller\u2019s turn as a surly doorman who makes Jerry\u2019s life a living hell \u2014 first by taunting him over alleged classism, then by forcing him to stand in as the doorman to Mr. Pitt\u2019s building\u2014is top-tier guest-spot material. The episode\u2019s true highlight, though, comes in the form of Frank Costanza\u2019s impressive, er, upper body \u2014 as Kramer puts it: He has \u201creal hooters.\u201d Which do you prefer: \u201cthe bro\u201d or \u201cthe mansierre\u201d?\n\n57. \u201cThe Chicken Roaster\u201d (Season 8). The people who run the Roasters restaurant chain liked this episode so much that they actually held a Seinfeld-themed party for their employees. And they were right to like it \u2014 it\u2019s a funny episode. Watching Kramer go from annoyed to obsessed by the encroaching capitalist fast-food glow of Kenny Rogers Roasters is as scary as it is funny because it doesn\u2019t actually seem all that far-fetched.\n\n56. \u201cThe Fix-Up\u201d (Season 3). A lot of exposition around a broken condom and a possible pregnancy builds to one of the best endings of the entire series, as George repulses his girlfriend Cynthia with his slovenly eating habits. Also, the woman playing Cynthia? A pre-Janice-from-Friends Maggie Wheeler, using her real voice.\n\n55. \u201cThe Airport\u201d (Season 4). Elaine sneaking into first class \u2014 or attempting to \u2014 is at once a relatable bit of comedy and a hilariously uncomfortable situation you wish she\u2019d just abandon. Watch this one even once and try to keep \u201cI like to shop at the duty-free shop\u201d from getting stuck in your head for days.\n\n54. \u201cThe Van Buren Boys\u201d (Season 8). Is Jerry\u2019s new girlfriend a \u201closer\u201d? Is he a bad person for wondering if she\u2019s a \u201closer\u201d? (Answers: Probably not; definitely.) George attempting to mug Jerry\u2019s parents to impress the Van Buren Boys is the very definition of a \u201clast-ditch effort,\u201d and it goes over as expected with the VBBs (and Jerry\u2019s parents).\n\n53. \u201cThe Kiss Hello\u201d (Season 6). Who doesn\u2019t like a kiss hello? Jerry, that\u2019s who. This is one of the few episodes where Jerry\u2019s antisocial neuroses are weirdly, even universally, relatable. It\u2019s also the first time George utters the catchphrase delicate genius, reflecting the breadth of his intellectual insecurity.\n\n52. \u201cThe Soul Mate\u201d (Season 8). The mystery George is trying to solve in this episode is twofold: Does the lawyer for the foundation set up after Susan\u2019s passing think George killed Susan? And what happened to the briefcase with the secret recording device that George left in the room to find out? The answer to the second question is complicated. The answer to the first is obvious.\n\n51. \u201cThe Bookstore\u201d (Season 9). \u201cSir, it\u2019s been flagged.\u201d There are plenty of Seinfeld episodes that perhaps unfairly prey on the ridiculous tendencies and policies of retail and service-industry employees, but you really can\u2019t blame the Brentano\u2019s employees for \u201cflagging\u201d the book that George brings into the bathroom. Truly a \u201cSwarm!\u201d-worthy offense.\n\n50. \u201cThe Maid\u201d (Season 9). It\u2019s Elaine\u2019s turn to sink to a new, horrifying low \u2014 in this case, by pretending to die over the phone when a persistent child keeps dialing her number thinking that he\u2019s calling his deceased nana. (Blame the change of New York City area codes, or don\u2019t.) Possibly the best Kruger-era episode for George (er, \u201cT-Bone\u201d), too.\n\n49. \u201cThe Face-Painter\u201d (Season 6). In which Puddy reveals himself to be the most fervent Devils fan possible, as captured by TV cameras. We also learn that the only time George has ever said \u201cI love you\u201d is to a dog (\u201cHe licked himself and left the room\u201d), which is hilarious, sad, and illuminating all at once.\n\n48. \u201cThe Seven\u201d (Season 7). George always wanted to name a child Seven. Erykah Badu and Andr\u00e9 3000 named their child Seven. Coincidence? Doubtful. They probably both love Seinfeld. You know who doesn\u2019t get to name his child Seven? George. (He can\u2019t even settle for \u201cSoda,\u201d though, boy, would he love to.) Kramer and Elaine\u2019s Solomonic battle over a girl\u2019s bicycle is a funny twist on a biblical tale, but it\u2019s a shame that Jerry never finds out whether his girlfriend really wears the same dress all the time.\n\n47. \u201cThe Butter Shave\u201d (Season 9). Another patently ridiculous episode, \u00e0 la \u201cThe Frogger.\u201d Kramer\u2019s lotion becomes appealingly aromatic after he bakes in the sun too long, causing Newman to have cannibalistic thoughts. The montage of George pretending to be handicapped at Play Now! set to Sheena Easton\u2019s \u201cMorning Train\u201d is its own highlight reel.\n\n46. \u201cThe Library\u201d (Season 3). One of the greatest guest-spots in the show\u2019s history is Philip Baker Hall as a menacing \u201clibrary investigations officer\u201d whose enunciation of the phrase pee-pees and wee-wees is mercilessly on-point. Plus: an early glimpse of Kramer-as-kavorka, as he romances a young librarian and nearly destroys her career.\n\n45. \u201cThe Cigar Store Indian\u201d (Season 5). Like \u201cThe Diplomat\u2019s Club,\u201d it explores racial issues \u2014 this time by having Jerry accidentally yet repeatedly offend a potential Native American love interest. Also, George\u2019s father\u2019s TV Guide collection is a sight to behold, and don\u2019t forget to stick around until the end for the incredible Al Roker cameo.\n\n44. \u201cThe Abstinence\u201d (Season 8). It\u2019s surprising that it took the writers eight seasons to come up with a plotline where George, a Neanderthal to rival all Neanderthals, becomes smarter after abstaining from sex. Consider this Seinfeld\u2019s take on Flowers for Algernon, if Algernon were a deranged, sex-crazed half-wit.\n\n43. \u201cThe Nap\u201d (Season 8). With a prime napping spot underneath his desk, George has it made \u2014 and even when the other George (Steinbrenner, that is) catches Costanza, he\u2019s too dumb to realize what his employee is doing. Eat it up, Georgie boy! It won\u2019t last for long.\n\n42. \u201cThe Glasses\u201d (Season 5). Elaine getting rabies and foaming at the mouth is one of \u201cthose moments\u201d that makes this episode stand above many others despite its relatively weak plot. (Another is George showing off the glasses that gave the episode its name.)\n\n41. \u201cThe Lip-Reader\u201d (Season 5). As this episode and \u201cThe Glasses\u201d prove, there are many episodes of Seinfeld where single big moments \u2014 quotes, images, actions \u2014 compensate for an underwhelming plot. So while Marlee Matlin\u2019s turn as a lip-reader who helps George learn why an ex-girlfriend dumped him is a decent arc, it\u2019s the image of George sloppily eating an ice-cream sundae at the U.S. Open that\u2019s almost as unforgettable as Kramer\u2019s ball-boy mishaps.\n\n40. \u201cThe Wizard\u201d (Season 9). There\u2019s a lot of gold in this episode \u2014 see: Kramer running for condo president of Del Boca Vista (and possibly killing an old woman in the process) and George driving Susan\u2019s parents to an imaginary house in the Hamptons simply to prove a point. But \u201cThe Wizard\u201d is also Seinfeld\u2019s Big Episode About Race, with Elaine and her new boyfriend unable to figure out each other\u2019s ethnicity and too uncomfortable to ask. When they finally discuss their backgrounds, it ends like most conversations about race did in the 1990s: \u201cWanna go to the Gap?\u201d\n\n39. \u201cThe Trip\u201d (Season 4). The second half of this extended arc isn\u2019t great, but the first part is absolute dynamite. There\u2019s a joke about a grim Three Stooges episode, a faux-gritty noir subplot, pre-9/11 airport security jokes, and Kramer\u2019s audition montage. Plus, George being humiliated by Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt on late-night TV is a rare success in network-TV cross-promotion.\n\n38. \u201cThe Voice\u201d (Season 9). There\u2019s a moment in this episode when Jerry goes to a pier and contemplates whether he wants to stay with his girlfriend or keep talking in the voice that he\u2019s created to represent her stomach. He chooses the voice, naturally, but thanks to the end of this scene, when he runs away and scatters the pigeons on the pier (an homage to similar scenes in \u201cThe Engagement\u201d and \u201cThe Invitations\u201d), it would have been memorable even if he had made the right choice.\n\n37. \u201cThe Movie\u201d (Season 4). A narrative pretzel that ends in hilarious calamity, \u201cThe Movie\u201d is like \u201cThe Chinese Restaurant\u201d with an open floor plan. If anyone else behaved the way these four do in an actual movie theater, they\u2019d be chased out; in \u201cThe Movie\u201d their actions are somehow kind of lovable.\n\n36. \u201cThe Labelmaker\u201d (Season 6). Jerry, Elaine, and Tim Watley engage in pro-level regifting, while George\u2019s attempt to oust a girlfriend\u2019s roommate who resembles him backfires multiple times. We\u2019ll never know who was going to win Kramer and Newman\u2019s game of Risk \u2014 shouldn\u2019t have insulted Ukraine!\n\n35. \u201cThe Bris\u201d (Season 5). Possibly the first time in the series where magical realism is used, in this case with Kramer\u2019s \u201cpig man.\u201d Of course, the \u201cpig man\u201d doesn\u2019t actually exist, but the guy who leaps to his death from a hospital window and destroys George\u2019s car certainly does. Moral of the story: Never hire a drunk rabbi to perform a bris.\n\n34. \u201cThe Stall\u201d (Season 5). Kramer\u2019s phone-sex plotline feels ripped from Seinfeld\u2019s more sex-obsessed early seasons, but what redeems the episode is George\u2019s failed bromance with Tony \u2014 including quite possibly the only worthwhile acting performance from Dan Cortese.\n\n33. \u201cThe Doodle\u201d (Season 6). Watching Jerry\u2019s parents (and Uncle Leo!) behave badly in a hotel room paid for by Elaine\u2019s potential employer is a rare treat. So, too, is Elaine\u2019s face when she\u2019s forced to spit out her gum in a life-drawing class.\n\n32. \u201cThe Couch\u201d (Season 6). This episode\u2019s abortion debate is somewhat less political than, say, when Roseanne tackled the issue \u2014 but Roseanne didn\u2019t have a cook pissing himself on someone\u2019s couch. George trying to watch Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s with a family of strangers instead of reading the book is a sneaky memorable moment from the show\u2019s run.\n\n31. \u201cThe Non-Fat Yogurt\u201d (Season 5). Children cursing: always funny! Although I\u2019d disagree with the kid in question\u2019s assertion that Jerry\u2019s \u201ca funny fucker\u201d \u2014 kid, have you heard his act?\n\n30. \u201cThe Maestro\u201d (Season 7). The maestro is one of the most bizarre secondary characters in Seinfeld\u2019s bizarre universe, but he always works. The jewel in this episode\u2019s crown is George\u2019s attempt to make work easier for a high-end clothing store\u2019s security guard. Well-intended, but ultimately, another ill-advised attempt to be a good person. Also: the first appearance of Jackie Chiles!\n\n29. \u201cThe Pledge Drive\u201d (Season 6). Uncle Leo may be unsuccessful at stopping the pledge drive after Kramer convinces Jerry\u2019s nana to donate too much money, but the fact that he even tries is classic Uncle Leo. The gag of eating candy with a knife and fork \u2014 how it spreads, where it starts, how far it goes \u2014 is the kind of absurdism that makes the show so distinct.\n\n28. \u201cThe Burning\u201d (Season 9). This was a great example of Seinfeld\u2019s writers skirting the boundaries of \u201890s network TV to break taboos \u2014 specifically talk of sexually transmitted diseases (gonorrhea from a tractor?). But \u201cThe Burning\u201d isn\u2019t just successful because of its provocative nature. Any episode with Puddy is a relative gem, and his and Elaine\u2019s ongoing argument over whether she is going to Hell ends in a revelation that fits Seinfeld to a T: They both are \u2014 and so are the rest of the cast, too.\n\n27. \u201cThe Bizarro Jerry\u201d (Season 8). Elaine\u2019s discovery of a \u201cbizarro\u201d version of all her friends is so ridiculously over-the-top that the fact the writers made it work is a miracle in itself. On top of Elaine\u2019s stumble into an alternate-universe Seinfeld, you get George foisted upon models at a fancy party that might not even exist.\n\n26. \u201cThe Raincoats\u201d (Season 5). The best of Seinfeld\u2019s two-part episodes? Maybe. Jack Klompus\u2019s return (along with both sets of parents), Judge Reinhold\u2019s cameo, Jerry\u2019s make-out with his girlfriend during Schindler\u2019s List \u2014 \u201cThe Raincoats\u201d has it all, along with George selling his father\u2019s clothes and attempting to con the Big Brother program.\n\n25. \u201cThe Dinner Party\u201d (Season 5). The chocolate babka gets all the attention in this one, but George\u2019s suggestion that they bring Pepsi and Ring Dings to a dinner party is so goddamn funny and perfectly on-character.\n\n24. \u201cThe Baby Shower\u201d (Season 2). One of George\u2019s pettiest moments in the series, plus the introduction of Elaine\u2019s on-again, off-again Kennedy obsession. Kramer has the best line in this one during a bizarro dream sequence that shouldn\u2019t work but does anyway: \u201cCable boy \u2026 what have you done to my cable boy?\u201d\n\n23. \u201cThe Engagement\u201d (Season 7). \u201cWhat kind of lives are these? We\u2019re like children \u2014 we\u2019re not men!\u201d That\u2019s Jerry in this season-seven opener, which opens with George dumping a woman after he loses to her in a game of chess. Took them long enough to come to that conclusion \u2014 and the realization prompts George\u2019s engagement to Susan, kicking off the most morbid (and possibly the funniest) plot arc in the show\u2019s run.\n\n22. \u201cThe Little Kicks\u201d (Season 8). Any time you feel uneasy about attending an office party, remember Elaine.\n\n21. \u201cThe Caf\u00e9\u201d (Season 3). Yes, the first episode with Babu Bhatt is as racially problematic as the character\u2019s other appearances \u2014 but despite itself, \u201cThe Caf\u00e9\u201d earns a high ranking because George\u2019s I.Q. test scam is one of the funniest grifts he\u2019s ever run. \u201cPeople think I\u2019m smart, but I\u2019m not smart.\u201d\n\n20. \u201cThe Bubble Boy\u201d (Season 4). \u201cIt\u2019s the Moops.\u201d Even before Kramer burns down Susan\u2019s father\u2019s cabin, George\u2019s physical struggle with the bubble boy is proof positive that the show is willing to get weird, and how.\n\nPhoto: NBC\n\n19. \u201cThe Gymnast\u201d (Season 6). Jerry\u2019s one-note fixation on the potential sexual prowess of the Russian gymnast he\u2019s dating can be overlooked in what is another powerhouse episode for George. The scene where he walks out of the bathroom with his shirt off is unforgettable, but it\u2019s the moment when he\u2019s caught eating an \u00e9clair out of the garbage that really speaks to the true essence of George.\n\n18. \u201cThe Chaperone\u201d (Season 6). Jerry accidentally kills his girlfriend\u2019s doves before she competes in the Miss America pageant \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t seem to care. George switches the Yankee uniforms from polyester to cotton, and it goes horribly \u2014 yet Jerry has no sympathy. George may be the more obvious jerk, but \u201cThe Chaperone\u201d is an important episode because it serves as a reminder that Jerry is a pretty big dick, too.\n\n17. \u201cThe Slicer\u201d (Season 9). George\u2019s tenure at Yankee Stadium is his most memorable workplace arc, but the bumbling, constantly underachieving Mr. Kruger is his most hilarious onscreen boss. (The faceless Steinbrenner doesn\u2019t count.) This episode gives us our first taste of Kruger \u2014 and boy, is it delicious, a classic George-focused story of self-sabotage where, in Kruger, he finally meets his dimwitted match.\n\n16. \u201cThe Invitations\u201d (Season 9). Even if George didn\u2019t directly kill Susan, the way he deals with what should be a tragic moment is so brutally, uncomfortably funny that it hurts almost as much as actual grief.\n\n15. \u201cThe Mom & Pop Store\u201d (Season 6). Was it any surprise that George would pay for a shitty car just because he thinks it was once owned by Jon (excuse me, John) Voight? The real-life Jon Voight\u2019s cameo is pretty much perfect \u2014but don\u2019t tell that to Kramer\u2019s arm.\n\n14. \u201cThe Fusilli Jerry\u201d (Season 6). One word: \u201cASSMAN.\u201d It was a million-to-one shot, doc! The impending divorce of George\u2019s parents comes to a head here, and it\u2019s defused in a brilliant way when Kramer accidentally uses the same \u201cstopping short\u201d move on Estelle that Frank once employed to jump-start their romance many years ago. Also, the introduction of Elaine\u2019s recurring boyfriend Puddy, played with aplomb by Patrick Warburton.\n\n13. \u201cThe Masseuse\u201d (Season 5). Some essential tenets of Seinfeld: Jerry is never romantically satisfied, and neither is Elaine \u2014 and even when George is in a place of romantic bliss, his need to be liked by everyone sabotages his own happiness. These are elements that keep the show\u2019s engine running, and that engine is humming perfectly in this episode.\n\n12. \u201cThe Conversion\u201d (Season 5). \u201cKAVORKA! KAVORKA!\u201d George\u2019s attempt to convert to the Latvian Orthodox religion just to win over a woman is almost as funny as Kramer\u2019s \u201clure of the animal\u201d nearly destroying an aspiring nun\u2019s ascension into the church. Jerry and Elaine\u2019s subplot, meanwhile, inspired a nation of snoopers to look through the medicine cabinets of everyone they know. Fungus?!\n\n11. \u201cThe Merv Griffin Show\u201d (Season 9). An episode where everything goes completely off the rails for each of the characters: George\u2019s \u201csocial contract\u201d with pigeons disintegrates and he ends up caring for a wounded squirrel, Kramer turns his apartment into the set of a TV talk-show, Elaine almost loses her job because of a box of Tic Tacs, and Jerry drugs his girlfriend so he can play with her collection of vintage toys. Still, nothing tops Jerry, Elaine, and George watching home movies from George\u2019s childhood and finding out that George was having his diaper changed until he was 8 years old.\n\n10. \u201cThe Secret Code\u201d (Season 7). If you don\u2019t pour out an entire container of Bosco after this episode, you clearly have no respect for the dead.\n\n9. \u201cThe Summer of George\u201d (Season 8). There\u2019s an argument among Seinfeld crowds that the show should have ended after season eight. While that would have been a shame \u2014 there are more than a few solid episodes in season nine \u2014 the last episode of season eight would have made a much better series finale than \u201cThe Finale.\u201d Think about the cosmic perfection of Seinfeld ending with George almost relaxing himself to death.\n\n8. \u201cThe Old Man\u201d (Season 4). For one episode, Jerry, Elaine, and George have the exact same job: volunteer work caring for the elderly. But Elaine is the only one who takes it seriously \u2014 and she acquires some game-changing wisdom in the process \u2014 while Jerry exploits his elderly charge and George, outstandingly, gets fired. From a volunteer job. It\u2019s a brilliant narrative conceit that brings out the worst in everyone, with an ending that speaks to a universal truism: When you get older, it doesn\u2019t mean you become less of an asshole \u2014 you just get older.\n\n7. \u201cThe Rye\u201d (Season 7). Actually, maybe this is the worst thing Jerry does during the course of Seinfeld. George pulling the marble rye through the window on a fishing hook cements the episode\u2019s canon-level status, but Elaine\u2019s oral-sex-focused subplot is curiously undersung \u2014 especially since a poorly played saxophone is always funny.\n\n6. \u201cThe Pen\u201d (Season 3). The only episode that doesn\u2019t feature George, which made Alexander so incensed that he threatened to leave the show if the writers ever turned in another script that excluded his character. That makes sense, but this episode is marvelous \u2014 a headfirst dive into the world of Del Boca Vista, where we\u2019re introduced to Jack Klompus and see the infamous astronaut pen that gives the episode its name. A muscle-relaxant-fueled Elaine hollering \u201cSTELLA!!!!\u201d at the end earns Louis-Dreyfus a million trillion Emmys.\n\n5. \u201cThe Hamptons\u201d (Season 5). A brilliantly constructed episode in which George is the victim of a series of misfortunes, then seems to get the satisfying revenge he seeks \u2014 before getting a tomato slammed in his face. At least it\u2019s a Hampton tomato! You can eat them like an apple!\n\n4. \u201cThe Fire\u201d (Season 5). Annnnnnd, this might be the worst thing George does in the entire nine seasons of the show. The police officer asking him how, exactly, he lives with himself is a proxy for all of us. Props to the writers for plotting a complicated but totally sound \u201cNo bad deed goes unpunished\u201d story involving Jerry and Elaine, where the former\u2019s fulfillment of every comedian\u2019s revenge fantasy results in the latter losing a promotion.\n\n3. \u201cThe Opposite\u201d (Season 5). What if doing the exact opposite of what you would typically do in a given situation could improve your life? The season-five finale mines this question in what is possibly Seinfeld\u2019s most effective attempt at magical realism. \u201cThe Opposite\u201d takes a hard look at the show\u2019s power dynamic and treats George and Elaine like elevators: One goes up and the other goes down, while Jerry remains neutral (or, as Kramer refers to him, \u201cEven Steven\u201d). Elaine\u2019s realization at the end of the episode that she\u2019s \u201cbecome George\u201d is one of the show\u2019s funniest moments. (Also, the Kramer-meets\u2013Regis and Kathie Lee scene is truly inspired.)\n\n2. \u201cThe Subway\u201d (Season 3). What keeps this from being No. 1? We\u2019re down to the end, so it\u2019s a matter of pedanticism: When the cop busts the mugger who\u2019s trying to steal Kramer\u2019s OTB winnings, there\u2019s an applause track that doesn\u2019t match the show\u2019s established antipathy toward sentimentality. That\u2019s enough to drop it a spot. Everything else about \u201cThe Subway\u201d is as pitch-perfect and refreshing as an empty, air-conditioned 4 train in the summertime.\n\n1. \u201cThe Contest\u201d (Season 4). Even today it\u2019s easy to marvel at how much comedy is packed into these 22 minutes without feeling like overkill: George\u2019s odd choices for masturbation material [\u201cGlamour?!\u201d], Estelle Costanza yelling at him in the hospital room, the sponge bath, \u201cI\u2019m out!\u201d Elaine\u2019s JFK Jr. obsession, and the episode ending with the gang ostensibly watching Kramer have sex with the naked woman in the apartment across the street.\n\nAt this point in the show\u2019s run, Seinfeld had already incorporated several clever masturbation jokes into episodes. But here, the show\u2019s architects created an entire episode about it without once saying the word, instead creating their own language that doesn\u2019t resort to cheap euphemisms. (The closest they come is Estelle\u2019s \u201cI find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park\u201d remark, which still kills.) Peerless TV, no question.", "description": "What are the best Seinfeld episodes? And what are the worst?
