He argues he did nothing wrong during the July call in which he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u25cfTwo volatile meetings at the White House have become central to the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u25cfFirsthand account of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call puts GOP in bind, emboldens Democrats.\n\n\u25cfTrump and his allies attack Purple Heart recipient to defend against impeachment.\n\n9:55 a.m.: RNC chairwoman highlights possible Democratic opposition to resolution\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel on Wednesday highlighted a report about one \u2014 and possibly more \u2014 House Democrats potentially voting against a resolution setting the parameters for the next stage of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEven some House Democrats are seeing right through Pelosi\u2019s partisan resolution,\u201d McDaniel tweeted, referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). \u201cThey know it\u2019s still going to be a process that\u2019s unfair to @realDonaldTrump.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHer tweet linked to a news story that quoted Rep. Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.) saying, \u201cI would imagine that I\u2019m not voting for [the resolution].\u201d\n\nThe report mentioned several other Democrats who have hedged about their support for an inquiry.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), an ally of Pelosi in House leadership, said that he is confident that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of Democrats will support the resolution.\n\nAD\n\n9 a.m.: Trump renews attack on Vindman\n\nTrump returned to Twitter to renew his attack on Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a top National Security Council official who testified Tuesday, as a \u201cNever Trumper.\u201d\n\nVindman, an Army combat veteran and Purple Heart recipient, told House investigators that his concerns about Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky drove him to notify his superiors because he feared Trump was undermining national security.\n\nAD\n\nVindman was among the White House officials who listened in on the July 25 call.\n\n\u201cYesterday\u2019s Never Trumper witness could find NO Quid Pro Quo in the Transcript of the phone call,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThere were many people listening to the call. How come they (including the President of Ukraine) found NOTHING wrong with it. Witch Hunt!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump has previously said \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d \u2014 a term denoting Republicans who oppose him \u2014 are \u201chuman scum.\u201d\n\n8:50 a.m.: First of two witnesses arrives at Capitol\n\nCatherine Croft, one of two career diplomats expected to testify Wednesday, has arrived at the Capitol for her closed-door deposition.\n\nCroft, who worked on Ukraine issues at the White House and the State Department, will say that \u201cthroughout\u201d her time in the Trump administration she heard the president \u201cdescribe Ukraine as a corrupt country,\u201d both \u201cdirectly and indirectly,\u201d according to her prepared remarks.\n\nAD\n\n8:30 a.m.: Democrats voice concerns about potential government shutdown amid impeachment inquiry\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats are increasingly expressing fears that Trump could let the government shut down as a distraction from the impeachment inquiry.\n\nWithout passage of a short-term spending bill signed by Trump, the government will shut down on Nov. 22. Republican lawmakers have insisted that is not likely, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Democrats about speculating about the possibility.\n\nDuring a morning television appearance, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) said Trump has shown an ability to go to great lengths to be disruptive, including directing his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani to intervene in Ukraine policy.\n\n\u201cIf the president of the United States is willing to go to the lengths of setting up this parallel diplomatic channel through Rudy Giuliani ... then sure, he\u2019s willing to shut down the government if that impedes this investigation,\u201d Moulton said on CNN. \u201cI think this president is incredibly dangerous because of the ways that he is willing to put Americans and our national security in danger for his personal political benefit.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis comments echoed those made by Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m increasingly worried that President Trump will want to shut down the government again because of impeachment,\u201d Schumer told reporters. \u201cHe always likes to create diversions. I hope and pray he won\u2019t want to cause another government shutdown because it might be a diversion away from impeachment.\u201d\n\n8:20 a.m.: Trump suggest Pelosi pursuing impeach to retain speakership\n\nTrump suggested that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is using the impeachment for her own political gain, calling it \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet, Trump quoted \u201cFox & Friends\u201d host Steve Doocy saying during Wednesday\u2019s broadcast that Pelosi was pursuing impeachment because she needed to satisfy demands from \u201cher political left\u201d to retain her speakership.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA disgraceful use of Impeachment,\u201d Trump wrote in his own words. \u201cWill backfire!\u201d\n\nPelosi has repeatedly said that partisan politics is not driving the inquiry.\n\n8:15 a.m.: Jeffries confident \u2018overwhelming majority\u2019 of Democrats will support inquiry resolution\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), an ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in the House leadership, said Wednesday that he is confident that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of Democrats will support the resolution setting parameters for the impeachment inquiry when it hits the House floor on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens on the floor tomorrow, but I am clear that that resolution will pass,\u201d Jeffries said during an appearance on CNN.\n\nAD\n\nJeffries said it is \u201cnot clear to me at this particular point\u201d how many Democrats will break with the party and vote against the resolution, which sets rules for the upcoming public phase of the inquiry. He said he is unaware of any Republicans who plan to support it.\n\nAD\n\nDuring the interview, Jeffries said Democrats are also eager to focus on the substance of the allegations, as Trump is now urging.\n\n\u201cThe rough transcript confirms that Donald Trump pressured a foreign government to target an American citizen for political gain, and thereby solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cThat right there is textbook abuse of power, particularly because at the same moment $391 million in military and security assistance to the Ukraine that was allocated by Congress on a bipartisan basis was being withheld as part of a high-pressure tactic.\u201d\n\nTrump has insisted that there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d involving his request to investigate the Bidens and the military aid.\n\n7:35 a.m.: Trump urges fellow Republicans to defend him on substance\n\nTrump went on Twitter again Wednesday morning to weigh in on the impeachment inquiry, urging fellow Republicans to \u201cgo with Substance and close it out!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn recent weeks, Republican lawmakers have largely focused on process as they have criticized the Democrat-led impeachment probe.\n\nIn recent days, Trump has suggested they defend him by arguing that he did nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are very unified and energized in our fight on the Impeachment Hoax with the Do Nothing Democrats, and now are starting to go after the Substance even more than the very unfair Process because just a casual reading of the Transcript leads EVERYBODY to see that the call with the Ukrainian President was a totally appropriate one,\u201d he tweeted Wednesday.\n\nTrump claimed the impeachment inquiry was \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201cjust a continuation of the Witch Hunt Hoax, which has been going on since before I even got elected.\u201d\n\nTrump later retweeted one of his attacks on the probe from Tuesday in which he derisively referred to Pelosi as \u201cNervous Nancy.\u201d\n\n7:30 a.m.: McCarthy slams Democratic resolution, Schiff\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) teed off Wednesday on the resolution unveiled by Democrats to guide the impeachment process going forward and on House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who is leading it.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re actually changing the process for the worse,\u201d McCarthy said during an appearance on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re making Adam Schiff now the prosecutor, the judge and the jury, and they\u2019re denying more Republicans in the room.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, McCarthy repeatedly called Schiff a liar, and he took a shot at House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who is playing a lesser role than Schiff for now.\n\n\u201cNadler is inept, so they know he can\u2019t manage it,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy also argued that the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s July call with Zelensky included nothing that would justify removing him from office.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing impeachable about this, so why are they dragging us through this once again?\u201d McCarthy asked.\n\n7 a.m.: House panel expected to advance resolution laying out parameters of public stage of inquiry\n\nThe Democrat-led House Rules Committee has scheduled a 3 p.m. meeting Wednesday at which members are expected to debate and advance a resolution setting the parameters of the public phase of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nA vote of the full House is expected on Thursday.\n\nThe resolution, which is backed by Pelosi, hands the lead role to the House Intelligence Committee and its chairman, Schiff, who would have broad latitude to organize extended questioning of potential public witnesses.\n\nIt also sets out for the first time the ability of House Republicans to make their own requests for testimony and documents, though those requests will be subject to a vote of the Democratic-majority committee \u2014 a practice that matches the minority powers in the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton.\n\nHouse Republican leaders have blasted the Democratic tactics, arguing that the impeachment process was fatally flawed from the beginning and cannot be redeemed with the adoption of new procedures.\n\n6 a.m. Extended impeachment sparks concerns about disruptions to Democratic presidential primary\n\nHouse Democrats increasingly expect their impeachment effort against Trump to stretch well past Thanksgiving, possibly forcing a Senate trial into January or later \u2014 a timeline that could disrupt the final weeks of campaigning before the party starts to choose its nominee.\n\nHouse leaders had initially hoped to hold a floor vote before the Nov. 28 holiday so the Senate could hold a trial before Christmas. But the surprising number of witnesses agreeing to testify behind closed doors in the Capitol over the past few weeks has extended the timeline and sparked a debate over whether prolonged impeachment proceedings are politically prudent.\n\nSome Democratic strategists have raised concerns that an extended process that bridges the holiday season risks losing the nation\u2019s attention or lending credence to Republican claims that Democrats have been distracted from the bread-and-butter issues such as health care and job creation that they focused on in the 2018 election.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Michael Scherer and Mike DeBonis\n\n5:30 a.m.: Two more witnesses on deck this week\n\nAfter Wednesday\u2019s testimony, two additional witnesses are scheduled to appear before the end of the week: Timothy Morrison, special assistant to the president and senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council, on Thursday, and Robert Blair, senior adviser to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, on Friday.\n\n5:15 a.m.: Testimony from career diplomats to outline Trump\u2019s dark view of Ukraine\n\nTwo career diplomats will testify before House impeachment investigators Wednesday that Trump displayed a deeply pessimistic view of Ukraine that was out of step with officials at the White House and State Department who saw support for the European country as critical in its battle with Russian-backed separatists, according to their prepared remarks obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nThe State Department officials, Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson, will say their optimistic view of Zelensky clashed with a darker outlook of the new government held by Trump and an informal channel of actors linked to the president\u2019s attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\nAnderson, a career Foreign Service officer, will detail efforts when U.S. officials tried to demonstrate support for Ukraine only to be batted down by the White House, including after Russian forces attacked and seized Ukrainian military vessels in the Sea of Azov in 2018.\n\nCroft, who worked on Ukraine issues at the White House and the State Department, will say that \u201cthroughout\u201d her time in the Trump administration she heard the president \u201cdescribe Ukraine as a corrupt country,\u201d both \u201cdirectly and indirectly.\u201d\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 John Hudson and Elise Viebeck\n\n5 a.m.: Trump shares tweets of GOP allies critical of impeachment inquiry\n\nTrump shared tweets from Republican allies late into the night on Tuesday, with several of them focused on a resolution unveiled by Democrats setting the parameters of the public phase of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cDemocrats go 4+ weeks with a secretive, free for all, no rules impeachment process\u2014and now try to save face with a short on substance resolution that only pretends to give the minority rights and blows up precedent,\u201d wrote Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) in one tweet shared by Trump on his Twitter account. \u201cAmericans will see right through this.
