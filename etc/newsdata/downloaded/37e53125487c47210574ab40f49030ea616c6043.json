The Exonerated Five, who were once known as the Central Park Five, are the subject of DuVernay\u2019s \u201cWhen They See Us\u201d miniseries, which is up for Outstanding Limited Series.\n\nVALERIE MACON via Getty Images The Exonerated Five and DuVernay.\n\n\u201cIt was the most important thing for us to see each other\u2019s story,\u201d Salaam told E! News. \u201cTo humanize us in such a magnificent way was such an honor. ... This was the first time after almost a decade for us to have seen each other\u2019s stories.\u201d\n\nBefore she hit the carpet, DuVernay tweeted a photo of her \u201cdates.\u201d\n\nThe Exonerated Five have made appearances at awards shows in the past. In June, the group received a standing ovation at the BET Awards, where they each presented a line of dialogue in front of the audience.\n\n\u201cWe are all on our own individual journey in life. We don\u2019t know where our journey will take us or if (it) will collide with others. One day will bond me to these men for the rest of our lives. But I know that in telling our truth, our lives have been changed forever. Your truth is the foundation your legacy will be built on,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe men, who are Black and Latinx and were aged 14 to 16 at the time of the incident, were coerced by detectives using scare tactics and manipulation into confessing to the brutal beating and rape of a 28-year-old white woman. They later recanted the admissions in court, but the media skewed their story as well, erroneously labeling the group as rapists before they could even get to trial.\n\nSantana, Richardson, McCray and Salaam were convicted as juveniles and sentenced to five to 10 years in prison; Wise was convicted as an adult and sentenced to five to 15 years. It wasn\u2019t until 2002 that a judge overturned the convictions, after another incarcerated individual confessed to the crime.\n\nDuVernay\u2019s Netflix series marked the first time that the story had been told from the perspective of the Exonerated Five. It\u2019s since been critically acclaimed for its deeply personal look into each of the individuals\u2019 lives and its bold exposure of the pervasive racism within the criminal justice system. DuVernay herself has nabbed writing and directing Emmy nominations for \u201cWhen They See Us.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the cast members from her miniseries are also up for acting Emmys.", "description": "The director's guests were the men who were wrongly convicted of a 1989 rape when they were just teenagers.", "authors": ["Asian-American Affairs Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8802b02300009705d4ae13.jpeg?cache=wfoupcvann&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
