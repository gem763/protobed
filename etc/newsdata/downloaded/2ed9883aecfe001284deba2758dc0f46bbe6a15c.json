The collection also includes her research files, correspondence, artwork, photographs and even the books she made when she was a child.\n\nMargaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo jointly win the Booker Prize for Fiction 2019 at the Guildhall in London, Britain, Oct. 14, 2019. (Simon Dawson/Reuters)\n\nWe asked Rattan to show us the newspaper clippings Atwood collected in the '80s, while she was writing The Handmaid's Tale and soon after its publication.\n\nOne of the boxes carrying the clippings includes a letter from Atwood, in which she explains how the clippings shaped her thinking at the time of writing The Handmaid's Tale.\n\n\"As I wrote, I kept a clippings file and into it went all sorts of oddments \u2014 from PCB levels in polar bears to collective hangings in 17th century England,\" Atwood wrote.\n\n\"Many other things fed into the book as well. As I collected all these bits and pieces, I reflected that there isn't much in the realm of human eccentricity and outrageousness that hadn't already been done.\"\n\nThe articles Atwood kept are wide-ranging in topic, but some themes emerge overall.\n\n\"She looked into toxic waste, birth control and fertility, sexual equality, abortion, surrogates money [and] baby stealing,\" Rattan said.\n\nOn religious cults\n\nThe Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library is the sole repository for Margaret Atwood's papers. (Yamri Taddese/CBC)\n\nAmong the clippings collection is a story published in the Evening Telegram on Oct. 31, 1985.\n\nThe headline of the story reads, \"Charges of brainwashing: Catholics say cult taking over.\"\n\nThe Associated Press wire story, written in New Jersey, is about a 1,100-member religious cult accused of practising \"subtle brainwashing\" in a quiet suburb.\n\nState influence on women's bodies\n\nAtwood also collected stories about politicians who forced or encouraged women to bear children.\n\nHer clippings include a story about a Romanian president who declared war on abortions and demanded that all patriotic Romanian women bear four children.\n\nIn a Canadian Press story from 1984, a Canadian MP suggests citizens 'start with renewed vigor' over the holidays to increase the country\u2019s population. (Yamri Taddesse/CBC)\n\nAnother article, a Canadian Press story from 1984, is headlined, \"Make a baby for Christmas, MP tells Canadians.\"\n\nThat report states that that a Progressive Conservative MP, a father of four at the time, had suggested that Canadians \"start with renewed vigor\" over the holidays to increase the country's population.\n\nInterestingly, Atwood also took a keen interest in stories about debit cards, which are often referred to as \"plastic cards\" in the articles she kept in her clippings file.\n\nSeveral of the clippings in Atwood's file are stories about the rise of debit cards. (Submitted by Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library)\n\nAn undated Globe and Mail column written by Ellen Roseman talks about the clear benefits of debit cards to banks, but not to consumers.\n\nAnother article, published in Esquire in 1984, includes an instruction on how to make \"a plastic payment.\"\n\nOn toxic dumps\n\nIt's no surprise that Atwood, who created an epic dystopian world in The Handmaid's Tale, thought a lot about damage to the environment.\n\nAmong her clippings is an undated Canadian Press story, which reports that \"no living being\" in Quebec has escaped exposure to highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBS).\n\nAnother story, published in USA today in 1985, is titled, \"Toxic dumpers slip around the law.\"\n\nAtwood fans, and researchers, may visit the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library to look at the files.\n\nThe creator of the epic dystopia in The Handmaid's Tale collected many articles about toxic chemical waste in the 80s.
