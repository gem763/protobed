Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., could have unintended consequences on rich Americans\u2019 marital choices.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nAccording to an analyses of the two plans by Harvard economist N. Gregory Mankiw, Warren\u2019s plan contains a marriage penalty, while Sanders\u2019 creates a marriage bonus.\n\nWarren\u2019s \u201cultra-millionaires tax\u201d would apply to those with more than $50 million in assets. The tax would be equal to 2 percent, but would rise to 3 percent for those who have assets valued at more than $1 billion.\n\nMankiw wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times that those parameters could create \u201can incentive for high-wealth couples to divorce.\u201d For example, a married couple collectively earning $100 million would be subject to the 2 percent tax shouldered by those with more than $50 million ($1 million per year for them). If they were to divorce, however, each would be worth just $50 million and they would owe nothing.\n\nThe same strategy could work for billionaires looking to evade the 3 percent tax, with larger savings potential.\n\nOn the other hand, Sanders\u2019 plan contains what Mankiw calls a \u201ctrophy wife tax credit,\u201d or marriage bonus.\n\nHis wealth tax would be imposed on married couples with a net worth of $32 million or more \u2013 and individuals with at least $16 million. Rates, beginning at 1 percent, would reach as high as 8 percent for married couples with $10 billion or more worth of assets (individuals with $5 billion).\n\nBy halving the threshold for singles, Sanders creates the opposite problem from Warren's proposal.\n\n\u201cAs I understand the plan, if a single man is worth $30 million, he pays $140,000 per year under the Sanders wealth tax,\u201d Mankiw wrote on his blog. \u201cIf he marries his assistant, who has a wealth of less than $2 million, their tax liability falls to zero.\u201d\n\nFor wealthier individuals, the benefits could be even larger \u2013 for example someone with $100 million could reduce their liability by $410,000 per year.\n\nOn the flip side, a financial burden would be borne by widows and widowers, who could be forced to pay when a spouse dies.\n\nCritics have pointed to many other flaws in wealth tax proposals more generally, which, as opposed to taxes levied on income and payrolls, target the value of accumulated assets owned by rich Americans \u2013 or their net worth.\n\nSome experts caution it could disincentivize capital investment, thereby leading to fewer jobs, less opportunity, less innovation and potentially slower economic growth overall.\n\nCritics also point out that it would be difficult to assign values to items, like private businesses or art, that don\u2019t necessarily have ready market values. The IRS would also need to assign those values on a continual basis.\n\nMeanwhile, there is an ongoing debate over whether the implementation of such a levy is even constitutional.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The ultra-wealthy may choose to divorce, or marry, in order to limit tax liabilities if either plan were to be implemented, economist says.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/couple-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
