There is a fact that his family, especially his son, cashed out money while he was the vice president of the United States. John Solomon, a journalist for The Hill, wrote that Hunter Biden received millions of dollars from Burisma Holdings, when in 2015, he was appointed to the board of directors of this company. Bank records showthat Hunter Biden's American company Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC regularly received transfers of more than $ 160 thousand per month. The money came from Burisma from the spring of the year 2014 to the autumn of the year 2015. During this period, Biden was the main official in the United States, who led the Ukrainian question. The official dossier, which was transmitted by the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, states that Hunter Biden, business partner Devon Archer and their firm Rosemont Seneca are considered potential recipients of the money. \u0412 a letter to an American journalist Prosecutor General of Ukraine Viktor Shokin wrote that before he was dismissed from the post of Prosecutor General, he developed a \u201cconcrete plan\u201d of the investigation, which included \u201cinterrogations and other procedures for investigating the crime of all members of the Executive Council of Burisma, including Hunter Biden\u201d.", "description": "Jennifer Lopez just proved that she can still stun in a sexy, green Versace gown.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QQlKpbQKWoJNeH.G6_LX3g--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/182370b0-dbff-11e9-9ca7-6fa545532a05", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
