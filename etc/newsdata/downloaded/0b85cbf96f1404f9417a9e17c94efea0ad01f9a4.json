I don't think it's appropriate for her. How can it be comfortable for her to be thrown into a situation like that without therapists or mediators?\"\n\nCharles said that although she felt Trump was being \"sincere\" in his appeal to her, offering condolences to her family and even holding her hand, she added that \"they were trying desperately to get us to, not give in, but to accept the invitation to meet her on their terms, which we weren't willing to do.\"\n\nCharles said she is willing to meet Sacoolas \"on our terms, on U.K. soil,\" but until the U.S. government agrees to send Sacoolas back, they are unwilling to do so.\n\n\"It was certainly, I think, not a bad meeting,\" Seiger said. \"But we are no further on in terms of getting what we want, which is having Mrs. Sacoolas return to the U.K. and in fact, that was made pretty clear to us at one point that was never going to happen.\"\n\nDiplomatic immunity usually only covers diplomats and their dependents based in London. But a special agreement has been in place since 1994 that covers diplomats working at RAF Croughton, according to Sky News. Seiger announced earlier Tuesday that the family's lawyers, Mark Stephens and Geoffrey Robertson QC, were ready to launch a full investigation into the role the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) played in granting immunity to Sacoolas.\n\nCharles said Trump held her hands when offering condolences and \"when he held my hands I grabbed a lot tighter and just said to him -- was honest with him and said -- as I said a little while ago, 'You know if it was your son you would be doing the same as us,' and he actually grabbed hold of my hand a little bit tighter and he said 'Yes, I would be.' And that's what he said that he would try and hit this and try and push it from a different angle.\"\n\nCharles said Trump's words gave her a \"tiny little bit of hope,\" that Sacoolas would be returned to the U.K. and Trump \"will hopefully take another look and maybe work harder for us.\"\n\nCharles, who also has two other children, one a twin to Dunn, said frustrations still linger as the White House has been unable to provide answers as to why Sacoolas was allowed to return to the U.S. in the midst of the investigation.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"They couldn't tell us who made the decision, who let her come back to the U.S. We asked how long she was there for, they said, 'Oh, she stayed for three weeks.' We're not totally sure about that and I think work needs to be shown to prove that somehow,\" Charles said.\n\n\"What exactly ... what date she came home to the U.S.? Who made that decision? Who thought it was humanely right to allow her to unintentionally, or otherwise, kill somebody and just walk away? I mean that's it. Everyone can see that it's wrong. It's totally wrong.\"\n\nFox News'' Marcus DiPaola contributed to this report.", "description": "The mother and stepfather of a British\u00a0teenager allegedly\u00a0killed by an American diplomat's wife in a wrong-way crash\u00a0earlier this year\u00a0met with President Trump\u00a0on Tuesday, telling reporters afterward that the president had offered to have them meet with the woman on the spot.", "authors": ["Vandana Rambaran", "Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News", "Politics At Foxnews.Com.
