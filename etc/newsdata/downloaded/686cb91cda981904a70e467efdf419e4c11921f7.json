They say his refusal led to a search that uncovered an assault rifle-pistol, a revolver, cocaine, and prescription drugs mixed with the opiate codeine.\n\nHe\u2019s being held without bond. It\u2019s unclear if he has a lawyer who can comment on his behalf.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Washington Post, http://www.washingtonpost.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Authorities in Washington, D.C., say they found drugs and guns when they stopped and searched a man suspected of fare evasion at the Pentagon City Metro station.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
