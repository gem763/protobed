She is not only seeking compensation for the physical and emotional damage she suffered, but to change the way those who are cooperating with ICE are treated by those in a position of power and who often wield total control over the ability to remain in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the woman first met ICE agent Wilfredo Rodriguez in 2006, after her brother was arrested for entering the United States illegally. An ICE spokesperson told The Independent that Mr Rodriguez \"has not been an employee of ICE for several years, and is not a current employee\". The spokesperson declined to discuss the lawsuit further, citing agency policy not to comment publicly on ongoing litigation.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
