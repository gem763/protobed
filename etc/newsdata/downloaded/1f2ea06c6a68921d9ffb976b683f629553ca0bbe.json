Sure looks a lot like the iPhone 11 Pro, doesn\u2019t it? source Hollis Johnson\n\nIt\u2019s been two years since Apple\u2019s iPhone X came out, which means it\u2019s not too unreasonable for iPhone X owners to start thinking about an upgrade.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro certainly has new features and improvements, but so will the 2020 iPhone, and the iPhone after that.\n\nIf you\u2019re happy with your iPhone X, why upgrade?\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nIf you\u2019re an iPhone X owner, you can trade in your device for up to $400 off the new iPhone 11 Pro right now, which essentially brings down the iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s price down to $600.\n\nSounds great, doesn\u2019t it? But work through the impulse. It\u2019s not really just $600. It\u2019s $600 on top of what you spent on your iPhone X.\n\nThere are plenty of improvements and new features in the iPhone 11 Pro, but none of them are worth prematurely ditching a perfectly good iPhone X. Not the new cameras, not the matte glass back, not the new chips. These things won\u2019t make you happier unless you were specifically looking for them.\n\nAll the new features from the iPhone 11 Pro and then some will make it to next year\u2019s 2020 iPhones. So why rush if you\u2019re happy with the iPhone X right now?\n\nIf your heart says upgrade but you\u2019re waiting for your mind to balance things out, maybe the points below will kick-start that logic:\n\n1. The iPhone X looks nearly identical to the iPhone 11 Pro, so you\u2019re not getting anything that looks new.\n\nsource Hollis Johnson\n\nIf you think your iPhone X looks and feels outdated, the iPhone 11 Pro won\u2019t help with that. They have nearly identical designs, with the major difference being the matte glass on the iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s back.\n\nOh, and the new camera system \u2026 thing \u2026 on the back, too.\n\n2. If you\u2019re not complaining about your iPhone X\u2019s speed while running iOS and apps, then it\u2019s hard to make the case to upgrade to an iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nsource Hollis Johnson\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s new chips might offer better performance, but unless you\u2019re actively unhappy with the iPhone X\u2019s performance, the iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s performance boost won\u2019t make a huge impact.\n\n3. The iPhone X still has a great camera.\n\nsource Hollis Johnson\n\nYou don\u2019t get the iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s Night Mode or the ultra-wide camera, but those are just perks, not must-haves.\n\n4. The iPhone 11 Pro has a fancy new \u201cSuper Retina XDR\u201d screen, but the iPhone X\u2019s \u201cSuper Retina HD\u201d screen still looks great.\n\nsource Hollis Johnson\n\nThe iPhone X\u2019s screen still has all the important stuff to make iOS, apps, and content look great, like HDR, TrueTone, and a wide color gamut. Both the iPhone X and iPhone 11 Pro even have the same sharpness at 458 pixels-per-inch.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s screen has better contrast ratio and brightness. If you ever complained about your iPhone X\u2019s contrast ratio or brightness, then you could add it to your list of \u201cpros\u201d to upgrade, but it shouldn\u2019t be the only reason why.\n\n5. The iPhone 11 Pro has a technically better selfie camera, but not by much.\n\nsource Hollis Johnson\n\nIf you\u2019re happy with the iPhone X\u2019s selfies, then why upgrade?\n\n6. Your iPhone X is lighter than the iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nsource Hollis Johnson\n\nIt\u2019s even slightly thinner and smaller overall.\n\n7. If your iPhone X\u2019s battery life is starting to dwindle but everything else about it is fine, maybe try replacing the battery for $70 at an Apple Store instead of buying a whole new iPhone.\n\nsource Hollis Johnson\n\nLong story short: save your money and keep the iPhone X.", "description": "Business Insider - It's been two years since Apple's iPhone X came out, which means it's not too unreasonable for iPhone X owners to start thinking about an upgrade..
