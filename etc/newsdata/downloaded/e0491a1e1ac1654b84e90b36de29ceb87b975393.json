While that news itself isn\u2019t shocking, the Trump administration\u2019s response \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 has taken many in DC by surprise.\n\nPolitico reported on Thursday that Israel planted surveillance devices \u2013 known as stingrays \u2013 around Washington.\n\nBut, unlike past administrations, the Trump team has not taken any action against surveillance by one of its closest allies, and spying on US soil has had no real consequences for Israel, American officials said.\n\nIn a tradition of vehemently denying any such operations, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu quickly rejected the report as \u201ccomplete fabrication\u201d. Mr Netanyahu, who has repeatedly called Trump a close friend and ally, said he has a directive to not have spies or carry out intelligence work in the United States, and added that the directive is \u201cvigorously implemented\u201d without any exceptions.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Israel Katz, also wrote on Twitter that \u201cIsrael has no better friend in the Trump Administration than President Trump.\u201d\n\nSurveillance operations by America\u2019s close ally on US soil is not new. American officials have previously said that Israel tops the list of countries who aggressively spy on the US, next to rivals Russia and China.\n\nHowever it is the Trump administration\u2019s inaction to such a diplomatic breach that caught the attention of analysts and policy makers.\n\nFrank Figliuzzi, former FBI Assistant Director tweeted: \u201cIf true, the real story is not that Israel spies on us, but that Trump did nothing\u201d\n\nResponding to reports that Israel tried to spy on him Trump said: \"I don't believe that. No, I don't think the Israelis were spying on us. I really would find that hard to believe. My relationship with Israel has been great.\"\n\nFor a president who has been quick to react to mere accusations against any rivals, his reaction to this story is telling. And it can be seen as an indication of the level of loyalty between Trump and Netanyahu.\n\nMost Americans would be surprised to learn that their hard-earned tax dollars generously given for Israel\u2019s security ... are being used to spy on our country\n\nDylan Williams, J Street\n\nRobert Rabil, professor of Political Science at Florida Atlantic University, says the FBI will get to the bottom of this issue, regardless of the White House position.\n\nHowever, he tells The Independent: \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump will highlight or publicly criticise Netanyahu. He is his brother in arms and I think Trump will rely on Netanyahu\u2019s help in his re-election campaign as much Netanyahu relies today on Trump.\u201d (Israel again heads to the polls next week.)\n\nAnd Rabil adds that he would not be surprised if Netanyahu accepts an invitation from Republicans to address Congress in support of President Trump ahead of the US Presidential elections.\n\nIn addition to the political symbolism of the spying operation, the story also presents a financial irony. The surveillance devices planted around Washington are very costly and sophisticated, and not many governments have the resources and access required for such a programme.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6084586384001\n\nIsraeli PM gets Boris Johnson's name wrong by calling him 'Boris Yeltsin'\n\nDylan Williams, Vice President at J Street, a prominent Jewish-American organisation, said the spying was \u201cone hell of a thank you note to American taxpayers for $3.8 billion of our money every year.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost Americans would be surprised to learn that their hard-earned tax dollars generously given for Israel\u2019s security \u2013 or at least Israeli funds fungible with them \u2013 are being used to spy on our country,\u201d he tells The Independent.\n\nThe report comes in a week when President Trump suddenly fired his National Security Advisor John Bolton, who has been an unequivocal supporter of Israel for years.\n\nSimultaneously, Trump is preparing the grounds for potential negotiations with Iran, a move that has made Israel uncomfortable, as it had in the past when Barack Obama reached out to Iran.\n\nBut despite consistent denials, this is not the first we have heard of Israel spying on the United States. During the nuclear talks between Iran and world powers, American media reported that Israel had been spying on the negotiations. The Netanyahu government allegedly use the information obtained through that surveillance to lobby the US Congress against the Obama administration in order to prevent an agreement with Iran.", "description": "According to a report this week, Israel has been spying on the White House.
