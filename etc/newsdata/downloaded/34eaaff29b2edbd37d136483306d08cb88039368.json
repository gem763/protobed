A Fox News commentator, however, won\u2019t be welcomed back to the network after he called Thunberg, who is autistic, \u201cmentally ill.\u201d\n\nThunberg, who sailed from her native Sweden to New York earlier in September, delivered a speech to the UN assembly, asking world leaders to increase their efforts to curb climate change. During a later Fox News segment where anchor Harris Faulkner facilitated comments between two hosts to discuss Thunberg\u2019s speech, guest and podcast host Michael Knowles said Thunberg was a \u201cmentally ill Swedish child.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\nMy full speech in United Nations General Assembly. #howdareyou https://t.co/eKZXDqTAcP \u2014 Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) September 23, 2019\n\nRelated:\u200b The Struggles of Being Neurodivergent in Social Justice Spaces\n\nThunberg, who is 16 years old, is not new to bullying from grown adults who have made fun of her authentic autistic expressions, generated a conspiracy theory that Thunberg is exploited by \u201cclimate panic\u201d adults with questionable motives or flat out discredit Thunberg on the basis of her identity as a teenager, girl or autistic.\n\nPundit Christopher Hahn, who also joined the Fox News segment, immediately pushed back against Knowles\u2019 mental illness comment, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re a grown man and you\u2019re attacking a child \u2014 shame on you.\u201d\n\nKnowles went on to claim Thunberg is \u201cbeing exploited by her parents and by the international left,\u201d before doubling down on his mental illness comments. He added Thunberg has \u201cmany mental illnesses,\u201d citing depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nKnowles isn\u2019t the first person to equate autism with a mental illness. \u201cAutism spectrum disorder\u201d is included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the guide mental health professionals use to diagnose mental illness. Autism is included under the neurodevelopmental disorders category. Also included in this section of the DSM is intellectual disabilities, developmental delays and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nRelated:\u200b The Importance of Friends Who 'Get' Your Autism\n\nDespite its inclusion in the DSM and continued use of the word \u201cdisorder,\u201d autism is not a mental illness or a disorder at all \u2014 it\u2019s a neurodiverse way of showing up in the world that\u2019s different, not wrong. Autism requires acceptance, not a \u201ccure.\u201d Thunberg is open about being on the autism spectrum, and she doesn\u2019t hide her authentic autistic identity, which she explained in a Twitter thread in August:\n\nI have Aspergers and that means I\u2019m sometimes a bit different from the norm. And \u2013 given the right circumstances- being different is a superpower. I\u2019m not public about my diagnosis to \u2018hide\u2019 behind it, but because I know many ignorant people still see it as an \u2018illness,\u2019 or something negative. And believe me, my diagnosis has limited me before. Before I started school striking I had no energy, no friends and I didn\u2019t speak to anyone. I just sat alone at home, with an eating disorder. All of that is gone now, since I have found a meaning, in a world that sometimes seems shallow and meaningless to so many people.\n\nRelated:\u200b Planning a Birthday Party for a Child With Autism\n\nBefore I started school striking I had no energy, no friends and I didn\u2019t speak to anyone.

However, mental health issues like depression or anxiety cause distressing symptoms directly related to the illness itself. Autistic people experience distress primarily because of stigma, a lack of support and damaging practices that require autistic people to \u201cmask\u201d or hide their autistic traits \u2014 external factors imposed on autistic people as opposed to caused by autism itself.", "description": "Fox News apologizes after guest says autistic teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg is \"mentally ill.\"", "authors": ["Renee Fabian"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/I8I9fHlL.RHs1xfIAHhuiA--~B/aD0yMTM7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_mighty_beauty_225/26d4e5d6ecd09f2da16a9da838d39b4d", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
