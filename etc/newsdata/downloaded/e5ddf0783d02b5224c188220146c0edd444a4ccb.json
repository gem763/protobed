They allegedly failed to inform Madison\u2019s parents, who have now filed a lawsuit (Pictures: Chapel of the Twin Cities/Google Maps)\n\nA school knew a bullied 12 year-old girl was planning to kill herself but didn\u2019t tell the youngster\u2019s parents, a lawsuit claims.\n\nMadison Ocheltree texted a friend on April 5 this year saying she planned to take her own life the following month.,\n\nThe concerned friend showed a teacher, who told principal Clint Johnson at the Andros Karperos School in Yuba City, California, what Madison had written, it is claimed.\n\nMadison was given one counseling session by school counselor Todd Tyler, but her parents were not told about what had happened.\n\nAnd seven weeks later the star student hanged herself, with the youngster\u2019s mother Morgan Ocheltree saying school could have helped prevent the tragedy.\n\nMadison\u2019s mother Morgan says she had no idea her daughter was \u2018so alone\u2019 before the bullied youngster hanged herself (Picture: Morgan Ocheltree/Facebook)\n\nThe Ocheltrees\u2019 lawsuit claims: \u2018No time prior to her death had [her parents] been notified of any problems of Madison\u2019s intent to commit suicide and thus they were deprived of the opportunity to obtain counseling for Madison or otherwise address the problem.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir lawyer Steve Gurnee told the Sacramento Bee that Madison\u2019s death was \u2018very preventable.\u2019\n\nFootball team blasted for axing little boys with disabilities\n\nThe sixth grader\u2019s parents say they only found out about the worrying text after their daughter\u2019s death, with Morgan saying she had no idea the youngster \u2018felt so alone.\u2019\n\nSharing a Facebook tribute to her daughter shortly after her death, Morgan wrote: \u2018Please \u2013 talk to your kids, know their friends, be involved.\n\n\u2018We did all that and still had no clue.
