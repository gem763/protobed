Lopez famously wore the dress to the Grammys in 2000 and it was considered one of the most daring looks of its time - even if we might not bat eyelids at such ubiquitous \u2018naked dresses\u2019 these days. The following morning a record number of people tried to search for the gown using Google\u2019s article listing format, when all they really wanted to see was the pictures.\n\n\u201cGoogle images didn\u2019t exist 20 years ago,\u201d Versace explained. \u201cThis dress, with Jennifer, it inspired Google to create it. It was the first time fashion inspired technology. Today we live in a technological world, but back then, one event prompted the creation of a new tool that now has become part of our lives.\u201d\n\nJ Lo More\n\nLopez herself made a surprise appearance on the catwalk, wearing the exact same creation and looking as incredible in the gown as she did two decades ago and warranting a standing ovation from even the most seasoned, stoic fashion editors. Her song Love Don\u2019t Cost A Thing was the soundtrack, fabulously ironic in Versace\u2019s gilded world where achieving high glamour costs quite a lot. That jungle print was reworked into suits, shorts and mac jackets, as well as red carpet-ready iterations; a draped bodycon dress with hard power shoulders and a belly button-skimming plunge neck jumpsuit. The motif had been expertly exploited on everything from green stilettos with spiky leaf sequins, to \u2018Squalo\u2019 trainers, to chunky sole sandals.\n\njlo More\n\n\u201cIt was a joyful moment when I first did this dress,\u201d Versace said. \u201cIt was a wonderful time. The world had the same reaction: jaw dropping.\u201d\n\nBefore the finale began, Versace showed, at the age of 64, that she is completely au fait with Google\u2019s latest technological advancements, summoning the dress to arrive on the catwalk with an \u201cOK Google\u201d call in the voice Assistant app. First the screens began to flicker with just some of the 23million images that magic up in seconds if you type in 'J Lo Versace dress'. Then, Versace's voice demanded to see the real dress, at which point Lopez appeared.\n\n\u201cI am proud of this moment in Versace\u2019s history,\u201d she said. \u201cAbsolutely Google has helped fashion. Anyone can Google Versace and know all about what we do. I use it all the time.\u201d", "description": "Donatella Versace revisited one of her house\u2019s most iconic creations at Milan Fashion Week, as she celebrated the 20th anniversary of the slashed-to-the-naval \u2018Jungle Print\u2019 dress worn by Jennifer Lopez on the red carpet -\u00a0a moment which is credited as the reason Google Images was invented.", "authors": ["Caroline Leaper"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/E3otNlfm6rp1QCqay4ar9Q--~B/aD04OTg7dz0xNDM3O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/b34d249f8b404e102bac0a732524e20e", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
