More than 2,000 couples have since married, many of them taking part in Saturday\u2019s festival.\n\n\u201cI am very excited because it\u2019s the first pride parade after same-sex marriages are recognised and I got married,\u201d said Shane Lin, who became one of the first to marry his partner in the days after the new law was introduced.\n\n\u201cI am very moved that people around the world are joining us,\u201d he said.\n\nBehind him passed a steady stream of colour, including dancers, unicorn floats and rainbow balloon arches.\n\n\u201cI support marriage equality because it is a basic human right,\u201d Henry Wu, a heterosexual teacher who brought his five-year-old son to the march said.\n\n\u201cTaiwan made huge progress in legalising same-sex marriages \u2026 I feel very proud we are the first in Asia to do so.\u201d\n\nIn the past decade Taiwan has become increasingly progressive on gay rights with Taipei home to a thriving LGBT community and increasingly large pride marches.\n\nOrganisers estimated that at least 170,000 people attended Saturday\u2019s festivities.\n\nThe issue of same-sex equality has deeply polarised society. Taiwan\u2019s constitutional court made a landmark ruling in 2017 to legalise gay marriage and ruled its decision should be implemented within two years.\n\nConservative and religious groups mobilised to oppose amending the civil code and won a series of referendums last November in which voters rejected defining marriage as anything other than a union between a man and a woman.\n\nIn May, conservative politicians put forward rival bills that offered something closer to limited same-sex unions but those measures ultimately failed in parliament.\n\nOpponents have vowed to punish the president, Tsai Ing-wen, and the politicians who supported the gay marriage law at the 11 January elections when voters would elect a new president and parliament.\n\nThe election will be dominated by the relationship with China and local economic issues, but Tsai\u2019s support of Taiwan\u2019s gay marriage law \u2013 which still contains restrictions not faced by heterosexual couples \u2013 could harm her on the campaign trail, especially in more rural and conservative places.\n\nSame-sex couples could currently only adopt their partners\u2019 biological children and could only marry foreigners from countries where gay marriage is also recognised.\n\n\u201cMarriage equality is the beginning, it\u2019s not the end,\u201d said Leong Chin-fai, a Macanese national who is currently unable to marry his Taiwanese partner. \u201cWe hope to keep pushing for issues including recognition of international marriages, parental and adoption rights.\u201d", "description": "Revellers march through Taipei as same-sex equality continues to divide country", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Taipei"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e7ece2a1ea109d9f60882a99d4e59b6c611b01/0_2087_3176_1905/master/3176.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=22cfc11aaf2f28e5cf1c975fc1d21b83", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
