On Wednesday, they broke into Caspar\u2019s pen \u2014 causing the 600-pound white camel to panic, and causing a mad-lib series of unfortunate events to unfold, as authorities would later explain on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt was just crazy,\u201d Pamela Bossier, manager of the Tiger Truck Stop, told The Washington Post on Monday, \u201cto the point of, why would somebody do that?\"\n\nBossier watched it all unfold on her security video footage. Problems arose when a man began tossing treats inside Caspar\u2019s enclosure, leading his and his wife\u2019s dog to hop the fence to go after them, Iberville Parish Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Louis Hamilton Jr. told the Advocate on Sunday. Problems worsened when the deaf dog would not respond to calls to come back.\n\nSo the man and his wife made a decision: They were going to crawl underneath the fence, past the sign that said, \u201cNo Trespassing,\u201d and retrieve the dog from Caspar\u2019s territory themselves, Bossier said.\n\nCaspar was not pleased.\n\nThe man started \u201cswatting\u201d at Caspar, trying to push him out of the way while she bent down to pick up her pet.\n\nThat\u2019s when it happened: To defend himself, the camel sat on her, authorities told the Advocate.\n\nTrapped beneath the camel, the woman apparently did the only thing that made sense in the moment.\n\n\u201cI might feel kinda funny saying this on TV,\u201d Bossier told WBRZ, \u201cbut she actually \u2026 bit him in his private area. That\u2019s about as nice as I could put it.\u201d\n\nHamilton was more blunt: \u201cShe said ... \u2018I bit his testicles to get him off me,\u2019\u201d as he explained to the Advocate.\n\nOn Sunday, Hamilton revealed the camel had been cleared of all wrongdoing after the Iberville Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office finished investigating the freak incident. Instead, deputies cited the unidentified couple for criminal trespassing and not having their dog on a leash, he told the Advocate.\n\n\u201cThe camel did nothing wrong,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cThey were aggressive. The camel was just doing its normal routine.\u201d\n\nBossier said she can\u2019t tell from the security video if the woman actually bit the camel\u2019s testicles and that he appears to be fine, but has called a veterinarian just to be safe.\n\nThe extent of the woman\u2019s injuries are unclear \u2014 Bossier said Caspar did not sit all the way down on her. But in any case, authorities determined the Tiger Truck Stop couldn\u2019t be held liable since the couple \u201cprovoked\u201d Caspar and ignored the warning signs posted along the fence. She said she does not understand why the couple didn\u2019t simply ask employees for assistance.\n\n\u201cThe camel was not attacking the dog. I watched it,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of them running to get help at the restaurant which is 60 feet away, where we have people who are trained to tend to the camel, they decide to crawl under the barbed wire fence. At that point, you\u2019ve invaded his space\u2014which is private property. ... I guess he felt threatened.\u201d\n\nThe camel arrived last July at the Tiger Truck Stop, about 20 miles west of Baton Rouge, to replace the zoo\u2019s former mascot, Tony the Tiger. Tony was euthanized for kidney failure in 2017 after 17 years in captivity.\n\nThe Bengal tiger died while he was at the center of an ongoing legal battle brought by animal rights advocates, who fought for years to remove him from the truck stop, among 18-wheelers and diesel fumes, and transferred to a wildlife sanctuary. The owner of the truck stop, Michael Sandlin, launched a \u201cSAVE THE TIGER\u201d campaign. But he only drew more outrage when he at one point considered sending Tony to a wildlife park owned by a zookeeper named Joe Exotic, the New York Times reported in 2013. Joe Exotic, real name Joseph Passage, has since been convicted of two murder-for-hire plots and 17 federal wildlife violations.\n\nInstead, Tony remained at the Tiger Truck Stop until his death.\n\n\u201cFor more than seven years, we litigated on many fronts to free Tony, and we are devastated that despite our best efforts, he lived and died caged at a truck stop that could never provide the life he deserved,\u201d the Animal Legal Defense Fund said in a statement after Tony\u2019s death.\n\nAfter Sandlin brought in Caspar last year, the same group told the Advocate it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d the truck stop would \u201ccontinue to exploit animals to try and promote\u201d business. A baby kangaroo, miniature horse and a coati \u2014 a member of the raccoon family \u2014 also live at the petting zoo, according to the Advocate. Sandlin has complied with state and federal health and licensing requirements, the Advocate reported.\n\nBossier said that the Tiger Truck Stop had never had any incidents with any of its animals in its 30 years like the one that unfolded last week.\n\nHamilton added that as far as authorities could tell, Caspar was a harmless animal who has \u201cnever been aggressive. never caused any issues.\u201d He told the Advocate he tried to understand why the couple did what they did, but got few answers.\n\n\u201cMy only question to her husband was: \u2018Why did you throw the doggy treat under the fence?\u2019\u201d Hamilton recalled. \u201cAnd he just said, \u2018I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u2019\u201d", "description": "\u201cShe said, \u2018I bit his testicles to get him off me,\u2019\u201d one deputy said.", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HFFP4C4HBZBYRNJ4BS2MTVS6SU.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
