There were no other impairments listed in the blood test.\n\nNASHVILLE OFFICER KILLED AFTER 17-YEAR-OLD DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENSE SLAMMED INTO HIS POLICE VEHICLE WHILE ON DUTY, POLICE SAY\n\nBrown\u2019s attorney, Michie Gibson, told Fox News in July that the teen snuck out of her mom\u2019s home early on July 4 with her aunt\u2019s 2016 Ford Fusion.\n\nMetro Nashville Police said an officer tried to pull Brown over but she took off and crashed into Officer Anderson\u2019s patrol vehicle after running a flashing red traffic light, killing him.\n\nAnderson, a four-year veteran of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department (MNPD) and a father of an 18-month-old son, was heading to a nearby highway to assist a fellow officer with a pedestrian who was reported to have been in a traffic lane waving his arms, police said.\n\nMOM OF TEEN ACCUSED OF KILLING NASHVILLE OFFICER IN CRASH RELEASES APOLOGY LETTER\n\nFox 17 reported that Anderson was traveling 85 mph and slowed down to 71 mph when the crash happened. The accident reconstruction reportedly showed that the crash could have been prevented if Brown did not run the red light and if Anderson, 28, hadn't been speeding.\n\nBrown\u2019s attorney had argued that Anderson was negligent, saying he was driving above the allowed speed limit while responding to a scene, according to WTVF-TV.\n\nGibson told Fox News the first thing an emotional Brown told him is, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s passenger, Antona Esaw, was rushed to an area hospital in critical condition after the crash. She was released soon after.\n\nThe officer who first arrived on scene, the same officer who tried to pull Brown over before the crash, reportedly said in court that he witnessed her accelerate to 50 mph while trying to get away, but he stopped the pursuit and lost sight of the car she was driving when she turned onto another street.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPolice said Brown, who was 17 at the time of the crash, was driving without a license. The teen was booked into juvenile detention on charges of vehicular homicide by recklessness, felony evading arrest, aggravated assault by recklessness, driving on a suspended license and juvenile curfew violation.\n\nThe district attorney is reportedly trying to charge Brown as an adult.
