Put the finished pudding in the fridge to cool.\n\nStep 2\n\nUsing a sharp serrated knife, slice the rolls apart and then slice each roll into thirds horizontally.\n\nDiscard the middle slices. Butter the inside of the remaining slices and dip them in granulated sugar.\n\nPlace them sugar side down in a frying pan and cook on medium heat until golden brown and caramelized.\n\nStep 3\n\nUsing a sharp knife, cut the chocolate bar into small slices.\n\nArrange the chocolate slices on the toasted bottom buns to create a barrier for the pudding, trimming to make them the right size.\n\nChop up the remaining chocolate bars and microwave in 10 second increments to melt.\n\nDip the top buns into the melted chocolate and set aside (or in the fridge) to set.\n\nStep 4\n\nChop up the Snickers bars and stir them into the cooled pudding.\n\nFill the chocolate barriers in the rolls with the pudding mixture and top with the chocolate-glazed top buns.\n\nStep 5\n\nMelt the white chocolate or candy melts in the microwave in 10 second increments.\n\nPour into a small zip top bag and cut a tiny hole in the corner.\n\nPipe a spider web on each chocolate-glazed Boston cream pie by making an asterisk and a few connecting lines.\n\nPlace a Whopper in the center and use the black licorice as legs for the spider (you can also use the rest of your melted milk chocolate to pipe the legs, making them squiggly).\n\nUse the white chocolate to pipe little eyes on the spiders.\n\nKing's Hawaiian Pumpkin Pie Mousse Brulee\n\nImpress even your most Puritan pumpkin-pie loving friends with this twist on the classic autumn dessert.\n\nABC\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 12-pack King\u2019s Hawaiian Original Hawaiian Sweet Rolls 12 soft caramel candies\n\n1 packet powdered gelatin\n\n1 15 oz can pumpkin puree\n\n2 egg yolks\n\n1\u20443 cup brown sugar\n\nPinch salt\n\n1\u20444 teaspoon ground clove\n\n1\u20442 teaspoon ground ginger\n\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1\u20442 cup heavy cream\n\n1\u20448 cup powdered sugar\n\n1\u20442 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\nGranulated sugar for bruleeing (about 1\u20442 cup) Candy corn and candy corn pumpkins for garnish\n\n1 cup powdered sugar\n\n2 Tablespoons milk\n\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\n\n\nDirections:\n\nStep 1\n\nUsing a sharp serrated knife, slice the rolls apart and then slice the tops off each one.\n\nWith a small knife, cut out the middle of the roll and use your fingers to scoop it out.\n\nYou should be left with 12 little bread bowls and 12 little lids.\n\nPlace one unwrapped soft caramel candy in the bottom of each mini bread bowl. Set aside while you make the filling.\n\nStep 2\n\nIn a small bowl, combine the gelatin and 3 tablespoons of cold water to bloom. Set aside.\n\nStep 3\n\nIn a small pot, whisk together the pumpkin, yolks, spices and brown sugar.\n\nCook over medium heat until just simmering.\n\nRemove from heat and whisk in the bloomed gelatin. Mix well and scoop the custard into a bowl to chill.\n\nStep 4\n\nWhile the custard chills, whisk the cream, vanilla and powdered sugar together with a hand mixer or in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment until the cream is at medium-soft peak stage. Be careful not to overwhip, or your mousse will be grainy.\n\nStep 5\n\nWhen the custard has chilled to room temp, gently fold it into the whipped cream.\n\nFold the mixture together until it is completely homogenous and no streaks remain.\n\nStep 6\n\nWhisk the 1 cup powdered sugar, vanilla and milk together in a small bowl.\n\nDip the lids to your mini bread bowls in the icing and set aside to set.\n\nBefore the icing sets completely, garnish the tops with candy corn and candy corn pumpkins.\n\nStep 7\n\nFill the bread bowls with your pumpkin mousse.\n\nUsing a cake spatula or a butter knife, smooth the pumpkin mousse over the top of the bread bowl, making a smooth surface and completely covering all the exposed bread on top.\n\nDip the mousse-filled rolls into the granulated sugar and caramelize using a kitchen torch or broiler.\n\nIf you use the broiler, set the rack as close as you can to the heating element/flame and watch them carefully to prevent burning.\n\nStep 8\n\nTo serve, place the glazed and garnished lids on the cooled and set the brulee mini mousse bowls.", "description": "If you want to enjoy something a little more creative than candy this Halloween, try these two new amazing recipes from King\u2019s Hawaiian.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/gma-halloween-food-ht-kk-191025_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
