Not that I realised. I was a 50-year-old mum living in Sussex with three teenage children, and I didn\u2019t have time to think about it.\n\nWhen my world started to look foggy, I just assumed I was getting more short-sighted, or long-sighted, wore grease-smeared glasses, had the wrong prescription or a dirty windscreen. I\u2019d watch my children\u2019s school sports matches and mistakenly cheer for the wrong team, think our side had lost the game and brace myself to tackle their disappointment.\n\nThen they\u2019d come over, flushed with victory, and demand: \u2018Did you see my catch/rounder/dribbling? Wasn\u2019t it amazing?\u2019\n\nNo I hadn\u2019t seen it, even though I\u2019d been paying close attention.\n\nSusannah Constantine (pictured) details having eye surgery, after being unexpectedly diagnosed with cataracts aged 55\n\nBut I\u2019d say: \u2018Yes, darling. Magnificent!\u2019 Lies. At the opticians I felt rage and resentment because I believed they were continually failing to get my prescription right. I\u2019d moan to my husband that my glasses were useless. It never occurred to me something more serious was afoot. After all, nothing ever showed up during standard eye tests at the opticians.\n\nI love driving \u2014 having enforced \u2018alone time\u2019 with my children, listening to Radio 4 or the velvet tones of Guy Garvey on BBC Radio 6 Music very loud. But as the years rolled on, travelling on unfamiliar roads was becoming a nightmare.\n\n\u2018Mum \u2014 you\u2019ve missed the turning.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m taking a short cut.\u2019 More lies.\n\nWhen driving alone at night, I felt unsafe. The headlights of approaching vehicles struck me as painfully bright and disorientating, like some kind of blazing alien spacecraft streaking out of the darkness.\n\nI\u2019d slow down to 20 mph for fear of crashing. My children refused to drive with me at night, saying it was quicker to walk. None of us understood how I had turned from Ayrton Senna to tortoise for no apparent reason.\n\nWith hindsight, I definitely should not have been on the roads. And yet, despite having regular eye tests, my official prescription never changed.\n\nI have been wearing glasses for long-sightedness since just after my A-levels, when I started having headaches and found it progressively harder to read small print. Road signs became blurry and I once mistook a member of the Royal Family for her much older and far less beautiful relative.\n\nMy big sister, whom I idolised, had worn glasses since she was six, so I was thrilled to share something with her. The first time I wore my tortoiseshell frames, I felt my IQ had jumped to genius category.\n\nSusannah (pictured) says her sight became foggy after she reached age 50, however High Street opticians were at a loss to the cause of the problem\n\nAfter that, my eyes were more or less stable until my late 40s, when, mysteriously, my prescription improved slightly. I raised this with my High Street optician but they were at a loss as to why.\n\nOnce I hit 50, however, the world went from a gentle soft focus, to gauzy, then cloudy, and ultimately downright foggy. I developed what\u2019s called diminished depth perception which made, for example, pouring a cup of tea a hit-or-miss-the-mug-altogether operation.\n\nI started to see halos around light sources at night. If I looked up at the moon on a frosty evening, I would see not just one, but an entire family of orbs.\n\nInstead of registering as single bright points of light, the lit windows of distant buildings appeared as an arcade of stars, a shimmering string of gleaming beads.\n\nIt looked as though mushrooming apartment blocks had invaded the pastoral landscape around my home in Sussex.\n\nIt never crossed my mind I\u2019d be struck by this curse of the elderly\n\nFrom the start of 2017, I also had occasional brief episodes of double vision.\n\nAt the time I feared \u2014 as anyone would \u2014 that these were serious neurological red flags. The cause, I now know, was cataracts.\n\nIt had never even crossed my mind that I could be struck down by this curse of the elderly. Although four million Britons suffer from cataracts, most develop the condition in their late 60s to 70s.\n\nI associated them with old dogs. My beloved mongrel, Archie, whom I rescued from Battersea Dogs Home after being dumped by a boyfriend when I was 30, had a double barrel of them and was blind in both eyes when he died aged 18. I could see his cataracts; a sort of sinister, milky-blue film over his soft brown eyes.\n\nNeedless to say, it came as a huge and unpleasant shock when finally, aged 55, I was diagnosed with them myself.\n\nSusanna (pictured) was told that cataracts had been developing in her eyes for between five and ten years, during a visit to the Vision Clinic, London\n\nIn June last year I went for a routine sight test at a new place, with equipment so hi-tech it was like walking into a Nasa training centre.\n\nAt the Vision Clinic in the basement of optical designer Tom Davies\u2019s London store, it took just a few minutes to spot I had cataracts in both eyes.\n\nTom told me they had been developing for between five and ten years. And yet my eyes looked perfectly normal \u2014 there was no cloudy layer to give the game away.\n\nWe all fear the health problems known to run in our families. Mine are breast cancer, high cholesterol and heart disease. Armed with this knowledge I have had regular mammograms, I don\u2019t drink or smoke (although vaping is a replacement vice), lay off fatty foods and exercise regularly.\n\nCataracts were a curve ball I had never expected.\n\nI soon learned that there could be a link. My mother had the highest cholesterol level ever recorded in our family, at a whopping 21 back in the Eighties. The normal level is four, while anything above five is high.\n\nShe went on to have a quadruple heart bypass, which allowed her to have an active life and go back to a diet of cheese, cream and chocolate.\n\nMine was measured at the comparatively modest level of 12 in my late 30s. I was offered statins to control the problem but, wary of unnecessary drugs, I held off until menopause three years ago, as cholesterol levels can rise then. I now take the pills daily.\n\nSussannah (pictured) was told that having her sight privately corrected would cost around \u00a33,000 per eye, she decided to wait for the surgery on the NHS\n\nCataracts: How to cut the risk Age is by far the most common cause of cataracts, with 73-75 being the average age of most sufferers. The Royal College of Ophthalmologists last year warned that because of a rise in the elderly population, the number of cataract operations is expected to jump by 50 per cent over the next 20 years. Research is still ongoing as to the causes of cataracts, but you are at higher risk if you have diabetes, smoke, drink too much alcohol, take steroids or have a family history of them. People with severe asthma are at risk, as the steroids they must take can affect proteins that keep the lens clear. But there are ways to reduce your risk: Change your diet: Dark, leafy greens such as spinach and kale can provide protection. Avoid the sun: Cataracts can also be accelerated by exposure to the sun, so shield your eyes from UV rays by wearing sunglasses and a hat. Get checked: If you are over 60, you should have a dilated eye test once every two years.\n\nResearch is ongoing into whether there are indirect links between high cholesterol and cataracts \u2014 and whether statins can make them worse. It\u2019s only a theory, until more is known about the science.\n\nWhat\u2019s certain, though, is that my diagnosis hammered home the fact my time is dwindling. It\u2019s easy to be in denial about the ageing process when you are fit and healthy, but, although I felt good, my sight and clogged arteries told the truth. I have two conditions strongly associated with ageing. I was well and truly into the final trimester of my life.\n\nA cataract is the medical term for when the natural lens of the eye becomes foggy. It happens when proteins in the lens start to clump together.\n\nAlthough age is the primary cause, doctors still don\u2019t know why this happens. Alcohol, smoking, steroid use, obesity and exposure to ultraviolet radiation such as strong sunshine don\u2019t help.\n\nLight rays entering the eye pass through the lens, which focuses them onto the retina at the back of the eye. The retina contains light-sensitive cells known as photoreceptors, which \u2018process\u2019 the information so we can see the world around us.\n\nSusannah (pictured) was referred to the NHS Sussex Eye Hospital, many friends were shocked that she had cataracts at such a young age\n\nAny clouding in the lens will degrade the quality of information reaching the retina, resulting in reduced vision, glare and loss of colour sensitivity \u2014 which explains why I kept thinking my glasses must be smeared, or my car headlights oddly dull. For millions in the developing world whose eyes are left untreated, the devastating outcome is blindness.\n\nI learned I had \u2018nuclear\u2019 cataracts, which form deep in the central zone (nucleus) of the lens. The cost to have them privately corrected would be around \u00a33,000 per eye, but I could have it done on the NHS if I didn\u2019t mind the wait.\n\nI have trusted the wonderful NHS for the delivery of three children and the patching up of various broken limbs, wounds and one frightening head injury when my daughter, Cece, 16, was thwacked in the eye socket by a rounders ball, resulting in a detached retina.\n\nI watched the extraordinary care given to my father after he suffered a massive aneurism aged 69 that would eventually prove fatal. When my husband broke his back in two places tobogganing, an ambulance battled a blizzard to help. He was in hospital for three weeks and walked out.\n\nSo no, I didn\u2019t mind waiting. I was referred to the NHS Sussex Eye Hospital, where they confirmed I needed surgery and I was booked in for three months\u2019 time.\n\nFriends were shocked, saying surely I was too young for this. In the hospital waiting room I was the youngest by about 25 years.\n\nSusanah (pictured) questions if her love of holidays in the sun combined with age is what caused her sight to deteriorate\n\nMy children, however, weren\u2019t at all surprised. The frustration of being driven at a snail\u2019s pace now made sense. Cece wondered if \u2018now you\u2019re blind, maybe your sense of hearing will sharpen, like Archie the dog\u2019.\n\nThe only people I knew who had undergone eye surgery were well beyond bus pass age or had had laser treatment to sharpen short-sightedness, something I had never even considered.\n\nBut I may not be an anomaly for long. Leading eye specialists report a worrying increase in cataract cases among people in their 40s and 50s \u2014 a good 20 years earlier than the usual age.\n\nBritain\u2019s epidemic of type 2 diabetes may be partly to blame \u2014 it damages blood vessels all over the body, potentially including the eyes. The more severe type 1 diabetes is already associated with a high risk of blindness.\n\nNot being diabetic, I wonder whether my age and love of holidays in the sun are the brutes responsible. Whatever the cause, things had got so bad that surgery was my only option.\n\nThe thought of anyone wielding sharp, shiny objects anywhere near my eyes induced anxiety. But the NHS\u2019s cataract-removal surgery turned out not to be the nightmare assault I\u2019d feared.\n\nOne eye at a time is operated on, allowing the first to heal before the second cataract surgery.\n\nThe operation involved removing the diseased natural lens and replacing it with a synthetic one made from acrylic, much as hip replacement surgery removes a damaged hip and inserts a metal and plastic version in its place.\n\nSusannah (pictured) says the procedure for each eye took less than 30 minutes and was virtually painless\n\nThe NHS does more than 400,000 such operations a year. Huw Oliphant, resident eye surgeon at Sussex Eye Hospital, undertook my procedure with angelic hands \u2014 although I was horrified to learn I\u2019d be awake while it happened.\n\nMeticulous planning was necessary beforehand, including measuring the length of my eye and curvature of my cornea (the front window of the eye). This allowed Huw to calculate precisely the power of my personalised artificial lens, so it would work perfectly to focus light rays on to my retina.\n\nI was given a series of drops to dilate my pupil, then more drops to numb the hell out of my eyeball. Then he made a very small (1-2mm) incision in my iris, before removing my lens using ultrasonic power suction before inserting a soft, foldable lens.\n\nThe procedure for one eye took less than 30 minutes, during which I remained awake and squeezing a nurse\u2019s hand to breaking point (Chris, I apologise).\n\nI was aware of lights, sounds and occasional gentle pressure, but it was all virtually painless. The worst part was trying to keep both eyes open with an interrogation-strength spotlight only inches from my face. The eye being operated on was kept open with what can only be described as forceps. Huw told me whenever I needed to be totally still \u2014 which always made me twitch involuntarily.\n\nOtherwise, I lay rigid with fear, holding my breath for what felt like the whole half hour. And then it was over. No blood. No eye piercing. No more cataract.\n\nSusannah (pictured) revealed that her vision has significantly improved since the surgery, however she still needs to use reading glasses\n\nSten, my husband, came to pick me up as I couldn\u2019t drive for 24 hours, but within minutes I was aware of an astonishing improvement to my sight.\n\nThe new world that floated into focus on an ocean of post-surgical eye drops over the next few days was strikingly \u2014 sometimes alarmingly \u2014 clear, crisp and bright.\n\nHaving now had both eyes done, for the first time in years I can drive fearlessly at night, read restaurant menus in low light, decipher distant road signs and foreign film subtitles, recognise faces from afar and even distinguish the expressions on those faces.\n\nMiraculously, post-op, I now have superb long-distance vision, although I still need reading glasses. Nothing\u2019s perfect.\n\nWhen I now look at the moon, there is only one, and the curtain has descended on those alluring light shows.\n\nIn the world I navigate these days, the colours are richer, the outlines sharper. I can see my children\u2019s sporting triumphs and failures and navigate roads without having to take the scenic route.\n\nThe only downside? Without the airbrushing my cataracts gave, my reflection has aged considerably!", "description": "Susannah Constantine who was diagnosed with cataracts aged 55, recounts her vision worsening to the point that she needed surgery - despite nothing showing up on frequent eye tests.", "authors": ["Susannah Constantine For Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/20/19802754-0-image-a-18_1571252977238.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
