Her blonde bob is pulled back into a messy ponytail, and she doesn't appear to be wearing any makeup.\n\nTheodore, meanwhile, looks ready for apple picking with his bright blue fanny pack peeking out from underneath his zip-up hoodie.\n\nThe little boy was presumably joined by his eight-year-old sister Arabella and five-year-old brother Joseph, though they aren't pictured in the snapshot.\n\nOrchard outing: Ivanka's sister-in-law Lara Trump (right) was joined by her friend Emily (left) when she took her two-year-old son Luke and their two dogs to Stuart's Fruit Farm in New York\n\nReady for Halloween: The 36-year-old shared a sweet snapshot of little Luke visiting the pumpkin patch\n\nIvanka also posted a precious picture of her three children fast asleep after their day of apple picking, writing: 'That's a wrap.'\n\nThe image shows Arabella and Joseph tucked into one twin bed while Theodore is sprawled out with his stuffed animals in another.\n\nIt's unclear if Ivanka's husband Jared Kushner visited the apple orchard with them on Sunday, though he joined his family on last year's trip.\n\nLara, meanwhile, was joined by her friend Emily Aronson when she took her little boy Luke and their two dogs to Stuart's Fruit Farm in Granite Springs, New York.\n\nThe 36-year-old shared a series of photos from the outing, starting with a picture of herself holding Luke in her arms while posing next to Emily.\n\nLara has her rescue dog Ben's red leash wrapped around her wrist and a half-eaten green apple in her hand.\n\nSay cheese: Lara also snapped a close-up photo of herself cuddling her son at the farm\n\nBaby girl: Lara and her husband Eric Trump also have a one-month-old daughter named Carolina, whom they welcomed in August\n\nShe is dressed casually in a black leather jacket, purple leggings, and neon green sneakers, while Luke looks a bit more festive in an orange and black sweatshirt.\n\nWhile Lara is holding on to Luke and Ben, Emily is cradling her friend's beagle Charlie in her arms.\n\nIn the next snapshot, Luke can be seen walking through a pumpkin patch with two apples in his hand. The final photo in the post is a close-up of Lara cuddling her son.\n\n'[Apple emoji] picking 2019 #WeSurvivedWithATwoYearOld,' Lara captioned the images.\n\nThe trip to Stuart's Fruit Farm seems to be a tradition for the two friends, who took Luke last year as well.\n\nLara and her husband Eric Trump also have a one-month-old daughter named Carolina, whom they welcomed in August.", "description": "Ivanka, 37, and Lara, 36, both took to Instagram on Sunday to share photos of themselves at apple orchards with their respective children.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/00/19418050-0-image-a-94_1570489682991.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
