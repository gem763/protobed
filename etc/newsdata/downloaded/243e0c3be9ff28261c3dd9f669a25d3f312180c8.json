(AP) - North Carolina Poison Control says nearly 75 children under age 5 have been poisoned by e-cigarettes and vaping products in 2019.\n\nThe News & Observer of Raleigh reports the group said in a news release that nearly 150 people have gotten sick from exposure to high levels of nicotine in e-cigarette products, with half of them younger than 5 years old. The group says people can be exposed if they swallow the liquid from e-cigarettes or get it in their eyes or on the skin. Parents are told to keep e-cigarettes and vaping products out of the reach of children.\n\nThe newspaper reported last week that two people are recovering at a North Carolina hospital after being placed on life support for lung disease thought to be linked to e-cigarettes.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The News & Observer, http://www.newsobserver.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "North Carolina Poison Control says nearly 75 children under age 5 have been poisoned by e-cigarettes and vaping products in 2019.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
