The Tar Heels scored with just over a minute left and elected to go for a go-ahead two-point conversion instead of a game-tying extra point. The conversion failed and Clemson recovered the onside kick to run out the clock.\n\nAlabama, meanwhile, blew out Ole Miss. Wide receiver DeVonta Smith set a school record with five touchdown catches and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa set a record with six touchdown passes. Tagovailoa also set the Alabama career record for most touchdowns in the game.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nFormer Clemson sports information director Tim Bourret noted that Clemson was the first team to drop from No. 1 in the AP poll after a win in nearly four years.\n\nClemson drops to #2 in AP poll after winning. First time #1 has dropped to #2 after a win since 11-8-15 when Ohio State won over Minnesota 28-14 yet fell to #2. Ironically, Clemson was the team that moved to #1. \u2014 Tim Bourret (@TimBourret) September 29, 2019\n\nWhile Georgia stayed at No. 3, Ohio State moved up a spot to No. 4 after a big road win at Nebraska. LSU dropped to No. 5 after not playing on Saturday. The rest of the top 10 goes Oklahoma, Auburn, Wisconsin, Notre Dame and Florida. The Irish moved up one place after beating then-No. 18 Virginia. The Cavaliers fell to No. 23.\n\nStory continues\n\nSMU is in the poll after starting the season at 5-0. The Mustangs won at South Florida and are undefeated five games into a season for the first time since the 1983 season. SMU is at No. 24, a spot ahead of Texas A&M. The Aggies dropped two spots after a close win over Arkansas.\n\nTop 25\n\n1. Alabama\n\n2. Clemson\n\n3. Georgia\n\n4. Ohio State\n\n5. LSU\n\n6. Oklahoma\n\n7. Auburn\n\n8. Wisconsin\n\n9.
