DEPENDS ON THE KIDS...\n\nBoth Chelsea and Manchester United entered this season claiming this would be the year they turned to their own youth players.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer and Frank Lampard had different reasons for needing to quickly bring through players from their academies.\n\nChelsea have a transfer ban imposed on them by FIFA and so couldn\u2019t go into the market. United have no such ban but with players such as Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez leaving and no strikers brought in, found themselves in a similar situation.\n\nThe two teams met on the opening weekend with United triumphing 4-0 but since then it has been a very different story.\n\nChelsea moved up to fifth with their latest impressive win coming in a 4-1 victory at Southampton with young talents Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount on target.\n\nUnited slumped to 12th with their 1-0 defeat by Newcastle United, their second straight reverse away from home. Solskjaer's side have just two wins out of eight.\n\nChelsea\u2019s youngsters look not only hungry but ready for Premier League football and it helps that the likes of Mount, Abraham and Fikayo Tomori, have all gained experience on loan in the Championship.\n\nIn contrast, United's youngsters are still trying to make the step-up from development football to the highest level -- it is a huge step, made even harder by the lack of in-form, quality experienced players around them.\n\nLOCAL HEROES\n\nWhat a moment it was for Newcastle midfielder Matty Longstaff, scoring the winning goal against Manchester United, on his Premier League debut for his local club.\n\nFor once the badge-kissing was entirely justified for the lad from North Shields, playing alongside his brother Sean in the centre of midfield.\n\nFor all their problems, there is a refreshingly \u2018Geordie\u2019 feel to Newcastle at the moment with Gateshead born striker Andy Carroll back at the club and Steve Bruce, a product of Wallsend Boys Club, in charge.\n\nSILVA ON THIN ICE\n\nEverton's 1-0 defeat by Burnley was not just a disappointing result, it was a woeful, soulless performance from Marco Silva's side who have now lost four in a row and have slumped into the relegation zone.\n\nAfter a strong end to last season and more spending in the transfer market, there were real hopes among Evertonians that the club could make a push for a top six finish \u2014 instead the team have gone backwards.\n\nThe concern will be that Silva\u2019 track record in England, at previous clubs Hull and then Watford, was of his team\u2019s showing promise before hitting a decline that the Portuguese manager was unable to turn around.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - Southampton v Chelsea - St Mary's Stadium, Southampton, Britain - October 6, 2019 Chelsea manager Frank Lampard applauds the fans after the match REUTERS/David Klein\n\nSPURS STRUGGLES CONTINUE\n\nSo much is going wrong for Tottenham Hotspur, who followed up their 7-2 home loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League with a 3-0 defeat by Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday.\n\nBut the stat that stands out the most is that Spurs have failed to win in their last ten away games in the Premier League and have not won on the road since a 2-1 victory at Fulham in January.", "description": "Five talking points from the Premier League weekend:", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438040068&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960OG", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
