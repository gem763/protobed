She is expecting their third child this month, and he is pleased to be just a relatively short train journey away.\n\n'There's been a number of times in the last two years that I had stopped,' he said. ' I was like, 'I don't want to do this any more'. But Kim, she was always trying to keep me going, and trying to help get me back on the court, stay motivated, and always happy for me to go and train and go away and stuff.\n\n'There's times when you don't notice it as much, but now I'm through the other side of it I realise at the time as well how difficult that is for everyone around you. Sometimes you're probably selfish and are thinking just about yourself, and 'God I'm in this much pain', but also there's a lot of people around you that are going through that as well and there's obviously lots of conversations that I'm not part of that my family is having with my team and stuff.'\n\nNot for the first time Murray has been grateful that Kim, daughter of renowned British coach Nigel Sears, grew up familiar with the demands of a career in the professional game and experience of how much a partner has to give.\n\n'Through most of my career it's been like that, just very understanding of everything that I've done, like going away for training blocks in Miami after a really long year and things like that. It might not seem like much but we don't get to see each other all of the time and it does make a big difference when you don't have that, like, drama in your personal life and lots of things going on away from the court.\n\n'She has been brilliant like that, allowed me to pursue my career and been unbelievably supportive of me doing that, so I've been very lucky. I think my family are just happy seeing me back on the court pain free again. It's been an amazing few months, really.'\n\nYou notice the subtle shift in Murray's language that has occurred in that time. He drops in references to the difficult things that are behind him, and speaks unselfconsciously of 'wanting to enjoy these last few years on the tour.'\n\nThe doubts are slowly evaporating, although he knows it will never be quite the same again for an athlete who was once timed as being even quicker off the mark in his first few paces than Usain Bolt.\n\nMurray and his team have been constantly evaluating how close he can get back to that after two major hip operations, and will do more tests in the coming four weeks before he re-emerges to play in next month's Davis Cup finals week.\n\n'Some of those results after Wimbledon were good. But then I watched myself on court when I played in Mallorca (the Challenger during the US Open) and I didn't look good. When I started playing singles again, as soon as I dropped a ball short I felt a bit lost, because when someone hit a big shot back into the corner I didn't feel like I could accelerate, or get to those balls. So I was often arriving there and having to defend immediately, put a lob up.\n\nThe 32-year-old beat Belgian wildcard Kimmer Copperjans \u2014 the world no 158 \u2014 6-4, 7-6\n\n'But in China (these three previous weeks) when I watched some of the matches back, my movement felt more normal. It was at a level where I could obviously be competitive.\n\n'In terms of strength that's as good as it always was. But if I take a few days off the engine takes a little bit longer to get going nowadays. I can't just rock up here off the train, get on the court and be quick immediately.'\n\nWhile Murray feels capable of winning tournaments again at main tour level, it could be that the biggest gift from this final chapter will be to bequeath hope to more ordinary people of what they can achieve in the face of hip problems.\n\nAccording to Giles Stafford, one of Britain's leading hip surgeons and a specialist in sport, Murray's whole recovery is being closely followed by both his peer group and the people they treat.\n\n'It has created a huge amount of interest in our group and has been discussed a lot. It has also been notable the amount of patients who come in wanting to know about Andy and what has worked for him,' he said.\n\n'While I have not been hugely surprised that it has been a success so far there is an element of entering unknown territory in his case, because we are learning all the time.\n\nIt is his fourth tournament in four weeks and Murray has largely conquered his hip problems\n\n'There have been some issues in the past with metal rubbing against metal, but as long as the metal does not disperse from the hip then he should be alright,' added Mr. Stafford, a keen amateur tennis player himself.\n\n'Because he will have been so diligent and disciplined in his rehab the issue of muscle damage will have been minimised, which is important. I would hope the signs for him are pretty good going forward, even though he is pushing himself to an extreme level, but only time will tell.\n\n'I think what he is doing is inspiring for anyone with hip problems, which are an increasing problem for young people in general. He is showing what a human being can do - some people don't realise that hip resurfacing is actually a type of hip replacement, what Andy is showing what is possible after hip replacement surgery'.\n\n'I am just delighted that he has been able to get back and play, having seen his press conference at the Australian Open and the mental turmoil he was in.'\n\nAntwerp is a far cry from Melbourne in January and those farewell videos, which you always wondered may have been a tad premature.\n\n'At that time I wasn't particularly fearful as I had come to a situation where I had to have an operation,' said Murray. ' I knew it could be the last time that I played. When I went into have the operation my hope was that I was going to be pain free but I didn't know how far I could take it. At that stage I was pretty much at the end of a long road and I was quite glad to be at that point, but my life has changed since January.\n\nMurray reveals he probably would have never got back to this stage without wife, Kim\n\n'Right now I feel happy, I have no issues with my hip and I'm able to do what I have always done, maybe not quite to the level as what I did in my mid twenties but I'm at a level where I'm pretty competitive with most players.\n\n'This is my fourth tournament in a row and the end of the season is coming at quite a good time for me, my elbow is a bit sore. I made some good progress in the past month but I need time to recover from that as well because there has been quite a big shift in load for me.\n\n' I am still improving physically but my body does need to get used to playing matches. The most I have played is still three matches in a week. At this level you need to be playing five or six in a short space of time'\n\nHe looks ahead to 2020, when his programme will not be dictated by ranking considerations.\n\n'I would rather give myself more breaks and play a lighter schedule. To be fair I don't think I overplayed much in my career, although I probably trained too much.\n\n'I think over the last few months the body is starting to understand what it has to do again. It's easier psychologically than when you are younger because back then my whole life was based on whether I won tennis matches, you still get miserable when losing but it's not everything.'", "description": "MIKE DICKSON IN ANTWERP: Forty miles and nearly four years from a great win, Andy Murray was on Tuesday night back on court in Belgium, seeking to complete his four-week comeback tour.", "authors": ["Mike Dickson For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/20/19756654-0-image-a-28_1571168755051.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
